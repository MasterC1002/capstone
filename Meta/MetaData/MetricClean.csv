Take one meter. Divide it into 10 equal parts. Each part is 10 centimeters long. Make a cube using that for the edges. Fill that with water near the sea level and you get a volume of 1 liter of water. Which happens to have a mass of 1 kilogram. Push that to an acceleration of 1 meter per second per second, it will take 1 Newton to do that. Push any object against a 1 Newton of force and you need 1 Watt to do that. Which happens to be 1 Joule of energy per second. Once you're done, mark the temperature at which the water you've been using freezes and call that 0. Mark the temp at which it boils and call that 100. Divide that in 100ths and you have the Celsius scale. 

Now say the same thing using Imperial units. Which one is simpler?

1344165886.0	xpmca	Adopting 24 hour time is a better goal than decimal time	lachlanhunt	188	32	53	"There's been a few threads lately discussing the adoption of a hypothetical decimal time system (or ""metric time"").  I explained in the comments of some of those threads why that's not feasible or worthwhile.

Instead, I think a much more reasonable and practical goal to aim for is the adoption of 24 hour time everywhere.

There are many advantages to 24 hour time, including:

* Resolving the ambiguity of times without explicitly stating am/pm.
* Resolving the confusing meanings of 12am and 12pm.
* Easier calculation of time with simple addition and subtraction.
* Easier calculation of time zones for international communication.

Parts of Europe use 24 hour time almost exclusively.  e.g. Shop opening hours no Norway are stated as, for example, ""07 - 23"", meaning it's open week days from 07:00 to 23:00.  This is far less confusing than stating it's open 7 to 11, as you need to clarify whether that's am/pm.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Writing Symbols and Names

The SI system has been designed to ensure that every unit has a unique and unambiguous name and associated symbol, even when used with a prefix.  Many incorrect symbols are used in practice.  All unit symbols and prefixes are *case sensitive*.

## Prefixes

The common prefixes are:

Symbol|Name|Example|Notes
:--|:--|:--|:--
M|mega|megalitre (ML), megawatt (MW)|Don't confuse the symbol with 'm' for milli-
k|kilo|kilometre (km), kilohertz (kHz), kilogram (kg)|Use lowercase 'k', not uppercase 'K'
c|centi|centimetre (cm)|
m|milli|millimetre (mm), millilitre (mL), milliwatt (mW)|Don't confuse the symbole with 'M' for mega-

## Unit Symbols

The symbols for all units not based on a person's name are lowercase (m for metre, s for second).  The symbols for all units based on a person's name are in uppercase. (W for watt, N for newton, Hz for hertz).  The exception to this rule is for litre.  Both uppercase L and lowercase l are permitted as the symbol for litre, but lowercase l is discouraged because it looks too much like a 1.

The symbol for degree Celsius is '°C'.  The symbol 'C' technically means coloumbs (a unit of electrical charge) though it's common for people to omit the '°' symbol anyway.

## Names

The names of units are always written *starting* with a lowercase letter, except at the beginning of a sentence.  But note that ""degrees Celsius"" still has a capital 'C' because ""degrees"" starts with a lowercase ''d.

e.g. ""kilometre"", not ""Kilometre"".

^(Intro by /u/lachlanhunt)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Distance

1 meter is the basic metric unit of distance.  It's about as tall as a chair. 

1 meter can be divided as follows:

* 100 centimeters (common in everyday use)

* 1000 millimeters (common in science) 

A centimeter is about as thick as your friend's smart phone. 

A millimeter is pretty tiny.  It's about the thickness of an american dime. 

A meter can be multiplied to make a kilometer:

* A kilometer is 1000 meters.

A kilometer is pretty far.  It's about a 12 minute walk, depending on your pace. 

Some other common things that it's important to know the size of:
An average human is less than 2 meters tall.  2 meters is a really tall man, and you'll probably never meet a woman in your life who is 2 meters tall ([there are only 9 in the world](http://www.oddee.com/item_96700.aspx)).  A tall guy is 1.8 meters, and a tall girl is 1.7 meters.  

You car is probably about 4 to 5 meters long.  Your house is anywhere from 10 to 20 meters on a side, assuming it's normal sized.  

The United States is about 5,000 kilometers across.  Alaska is about 4,000 kilometers across, from the tip of the aleutian islands to the end of the panhandle. 

The distance from the equator to the north pole is defined as exactly 10,000 kilometers, so the circumference of the earth is around 40,000 kilometers.  The earth's diameter is about 12,000 km, and we orbit the sun at a distance of around 150 million km.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Speed

Speed is directly proportional to distance, it just involves dividing by time.  That said, there are really only two common metric speed units:

* Kilometers per hour (km/h)

* Meters per second (m/s)

A single kilometer per hour is painfully slow.  A standard walking pace is between 4 and 5 kilometers per hour - you'd have to be walking in circles, stopping to talk to your neighbors, and counting bricks on the sidewalk to go as slow as 1 kilometer per hour.  Often used in vehicle speeds, here are some common speed limits:

Small Towns: 40 km/h (pretty slow)

Back Roads: 70 km/h (pretty quick, but not highway speeds)

Highway: 100 km/h - 110 km/h (keep in mind this is the speed limit, now how fast most people drive

Racecars: Nearly 300 km/h

Commercial Airplanes, cruising speed: 800 km/h.

One meter per second is faster, but it's still not all that impressive.  It's the pace of a leisurely stroll through the neighborhood.  It's rarely used for human scale speeds, instead being much more common in the scientific community, due to the lack of unit conversion when everything else is measured in meters and seconds. 

A car on the highway is travelling about 30 m/s, a bullet leaves the muzzle of a bb gun at about 100 m/s, and leaves the muzzle of a high powered rifle at over 1000 m/s.  

Sound travels at 340 m/s through air at sea level, and light travels at 300 million m/s.  

The thunderstorm trick in metric:  Light travels so fast we can assume it reaches your eyes instantaneously, so for every second the sound lags the lightning was another 340 meters away.  We can make a household phrase by saying ""count the time between the flash and the boom, and it's 1 kilometer away for every 3 seconds"".  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Mass

This is a tricky unit, because the imperial system deals primarily with ""weight"" - which is the force of gravity on an object, and is dependent on the local gravitational field.  The metric system deals with mass, which is how much stuff is in an object, and will not change whether you're on Earth, the moon, in space, or on the ""surface"" of Jupiter.  

A gram is the basic unit of mass in the metric system.  It's pretty small - it's about the weight of a dollar bill.  Not much to it. 

A gram can be divided as follows: 

* 1000 milligrams

A milligram is about the weight of a small snowflake. 

A gram is much more often combined into larger units, namely:

* a Kilogram is 1000 grams

A kilogram is exactly one liter of water (a Nalgene of water, for example)

Other important things about metric mass:

Water weighs almost precisely 1 gram per milliliter, or 1 kilogram per liter.  Humans weigh anywhere between 50 kg (small women) to 500 kg (largest people on the planet).  An average male weighs about 80 kg.  

When talking about really heavy things, the tonne is used.  A tonne is 1000 kilograms.  A small car weighs about one tonne. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Volume
The basic unit of volume is the liter.  It's a pretty familiar unit here in the US, as most soda is sold by the 1 and 2 liter bottles.  A nalgene bottle holds a liter. 

A liter can be divided as follows:

* 10 deciliters (common in cooking)
* 1000 milliliters (common)

A deciliter is about as much juice as you'd get from a large orange.  

A milliliter is very useful for measuring small volumes of things.  It's about the volume of a large blueberry.  

When talking about volumes above one liter, the cubic meter is often used.  A liter is defined as 1/1000th of the volume of a cubic meter, so a kiloliter is equal to a cubic meter.  When discussing very large objects, such as swimming pools, or the Earth's oceans, the cubic meter is normally used.  A standard olympic pool holds about 2500 cubic meters of water, or enough to fill over 6000 kiddie pools. 

In some countries the kiloliter and megaliter are used, for example in discussing the volume of water behind a dam or the amount of oil being bought or sold.  

Liquid medicine is often dosed out in milliliters, with 5, 10, and 15 ml being common doses.  A test tube normally holds about 10 milliliters.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Temperature

This is a tricky one, mostly because it's the one that doesn't follow metric conventions.  However, it's also pretty easy to grasp.  

The metric unit of temperature is the degree celcius.  The scale sets water freezing at 0 degrees and water boiling at 100 degrees.  There are no names for the divided units, nor names for the combined units. 

So you just have to remember this scale (from a northerner's perspective):

-20: ""Snot freezing cold"" - the insides of your nose freeze.

-10: ""Really freaking cold"" - but your nose isn't frozen. 

0:    Water freezes. 

10:   ""A brisk fall day""

20:   ""Room Temperature""

30:   ""Honey, turn the AC on""

37:   Standard human temperature

40:   ""Time to go to the doctor for that fever""

50:   ""Dear God I'm going to die""

60:   Hot Coffee

70:   Beef is well done

80:   Brewing Tea

90:   Your computer chip is about to overheat

100: Water boils

180: Standard cooking temperature in an oven

250: Paper will spontaneously ignite ([debated](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/explainer/2012/06/ray_bradbury_death_does_paper_really_burn_at_451_degrees_fahrenheit_.html))

1344813639.0	y450o	Measuring Rainfall	lachlanhunt	75	7	14	"It's common in the US to measure and report rainfall in inches. However, this makes calculating the total amount of rainfall over a given area much more complicated than it needs to be.

To illustrate, calculating how many gallons of rain falls over 1 acre of land:

    1 acre × 1 in = 1 chain × 1 furlong * 1 in
                  = 1 chain × 10 chains × 1 in
                  = 66 ft × 660 ft × 1 in
                  = 792 in × 7920 in × 1 in
                  = 6,272,640 in³

Now, converting that to gallons requires dividing that by the number of cubic inches in a gallon, which is oddly defined as 231 in³

    6,272,640 in³ / 231 in³/gal = 27,154.2857 gal

A similar calculation could also be done for cubic feet, substituting 1728 in³/ft³.

The calculation is similar for determining how much water falls on a roof and flows into a rain water tank.

By comparison, and to illustrate why metric is superior in this case, measuring rainfall in mm instead of inches is a very simple mental calculation based on knowing the area in square metres.  1 mm of rainfall per square metre is calculated as:

    1 mm × 1 m² = 0.001 m × 1 m²
                = 0.001 m³
                = 1 L

Or simply 1 mm × 1 m² = 1 L.

So with land area measured in square metres or hectares (10,000 m²), calculating how much rainfall falls over a given area is a very simple mental calculation..

1349141507.0	10sk33	Why don't American science writers use the metric system?	klystron	72	13	38	"I have started reading *Once and Future Giants* by Sharon Levy and have noticed that yet again, another book intended for a scientifically literate readership is written using US Customary measurements.

Why is this so?

The author has a degree in biology, and would be expected to be familiar with the metric system. Her readership is likely to be intelligent, educated in scientific matters, and to know about the metric system. If she obtains it from scientists, her source material is going to be in metric measurements. All of the readers outside the US are going to be users of the metric system.

So why has it all been translated to miles, feet, inches and pounds? Was it the publishers decision? Are they worried that metres and kilograms might scare off potential readers?

Do the foreign-language editions of American science books use metric measurements? (That is, books intended for a general readership, not scientific textbooks.)

I am not singling out this author in particular, just giving her as an example of a common and puzzling practice of US publishers."	t5_2r25p	True

It was hard at first having to do the calculations (F = 9/5C + 32), but as time passed, the calculations became easier and easier. Then I stopped calculating and found myself thinking in Celsius. Oh, it's 18 degrees? No wonder I'm so cold. Holy cow, 27 degrees? My computer's really heatin' this room up.

Of course, I'll do the calculations every now and again just cuz I'm curious, but it's pretty neat being able to naturally think in metric. 

For us imperialists, learning metric is much like learning a new language. At first, you'll have to translate for it to make sense, but it becomes second nature with practice. We obviously can't change our imperial mindset all at once, but it is possible to start thinking metric, be it one or two units at a time.

So pick a commonly used unit and start converting it whenever you encounter it. Try converting speed limits while driving. Or start switching people's height to centimeters. It's a hassle at first, but with time, conversions won't be necessary. You'll know that a car going 150 km/hour is probably going to get pulled over. See a basketball player's height as 220 cm, you'll think ""Holy cow what a giant.""

Imperialists everywhere, don't just convert to metric. Think metric.

Most of those so-called 10 reasons can be lumped together and categorized as to what happens when people and nations have access to the most perfect system ever invented, yet choose their own rules and subunits.
 
USC and imperial might not have this problem, but only because they are not universally used.  When only 5 % of the world's population are still stuck in the past, how many variations can you expect?
 
Consider though that hundreds of years ago, when there was only pre-metric units, every Tom, Dick and harry had his own version.

1363070720.0	1a4w1l	Why the US can't adapt the Metric system fully: An example and our half-ass Metrications.	mk1988	45	6	104	"&gt;The international yard and pound agreement of July 1959 defined the length of the international yard in the United States and countries of the Commonwealth of Nations as exactly 0.9144 meter. Consequently, the international foot is defined to be equal to exactly 0.3048 meter. This was 2 ppm shorter than the previous U.S definition and 1.7 ppm longer than the previous British definition.
From Wikipedia...

But the survey foot was the old foot.

""International"" foot: 0.3048 m (why they didn't just make it exactly 30 centimeters is beyond me)

Survey foot: 0.3048006096 m ...ahh, they just took the digits past milimeters off, still they should of just made it, the international foot 30 cm exactly, heck, 33.33333... meters abolishing the yard and calling it just a meter, that way the metric system would already be ingrained into the imperial system muhahahah, but thats besides the point.

Which leads to my next point:
They REFUSED to change everything on maps to the new foot.
So we are left with two kinds of feet. Why does this matter? Well when we started to adopt the metric system, we REFUSED to change existing things to the new system, but everything new, like electric, lumens, kwh/100 MILES for electric cars (this is called a hybrid unit but still makes use of SI instead of horsepower... MILES is there because thats what the roads are in...) Then we stated caring about how much is in our food and drinks and now measure it in grams, miligrams, and 240 mililiters for a metric cup - as opposed to 8 oz - same thing with the international foot thing I went over before, why not 250 mL? And all high tech stuff is done in SI, or SI based units like hertz, kilohertz, megahertz, and gigahertz with data storage and transmission using a non-si unit of bytes and bits. And don't forget watts, ampere, and volts, lumen all SI units.

Now on to our half ass units...

We have mil(li-inches) which is 0.001 of an inch or 25.4 micrometers-hmm 2.45 cm/1000 WOAH base 10 conversion, in MY arbitrary retarded rollercoaster?

Then we have these poor attempts apply SI units to imperial terms:

kilofeet 1000 feet or 333.333... yards (suffers the same repeating number defect as dividing a meter up 3 times)

kiloyard 1000 yards or pretty darn close to a km

kilopound - half a ton and close to half a tonne- 1000 pounds

But wait, there's more!

When you buy gas, you don't buy it in Gallons and ounces (a true imperal format), you buy it down to the thousandth (milligallon?) of a gallon. 0.001 gal = 3.78541 mL
When you buy cut meats and deli meats, you buy it in the hundredth of a pound (centipound?) or by units of 453.592 milligrams.

Then people say the dollar is metric and ""cent"" is kinda short for centidollar... this is how they taught the metric system in school, at least centimeters.

Applying SI units to imperial terms would be like trying to hook a telegraph up to a 4g network or VoIP line (that would be ToIP - Telegraph over IP)...

Tl;dr: if you think we can adapt the metric system, think twice, because we couldn't even accept a new foot and yard!
With that said, we need to really get motivated and get off our asses or the world is going to kick our ass."	t5_2r25p	True

I just did a search in /r/metric's search function (hilarious function, I know), and the decimeter is mentioned just once, and its mention is about removing it.  Sad.  Fortunately the deciliter made it through.

The decimeter I feel is highly ignored, yet extremely important.  I also feel its very key for getting Americans to relate to the metric system.  If I take about the average height of the American man, about 5'9"" (okay, maybe not the average, but its about the average, work with me here) in metric that's 1.75m or 175cm.  There are two things that don't sit well with this.  One is way too small of a number to feel significant, and the other is way large of a number to keep track.  It seems like there needs to be a happy medium.

Oh but wait, there is.  17.5dm.  Feels pretty good.  Not too big, not too small.  About twice as big as what we're used to (5'9"", 6'1"", 5'3"" etc) but its a lot closer to the other alternatives. 


There's one more reason that I feel that the decimeter needs more representation for american society to feel comfortable with the metric system.  This is that it is base 10.  Think about it.  Right now, commonly, we go from meters (base 1) to centimeters (base 100) to millimeters (base 1000).  We commonly just skip base 10.  When first learning something, you should never cut corners.  That's just what we're doing.  We're cutting corners, the decimeter.  Sure, in scientific practice (i'm not a scientist) I can see it to be practical to cut corners, take shortcuts.  I know that 36 meters is 36,000 millimeters.  Theres no need to convert to decimeters, then to centimeters, then to millimeters.  

**tl;dr:  I feel strongly that putting more emphasis on the decimeter and not ignoring its existence will help americans adjust to the metric system by a)feeling more familiar, a number not too high, not too small, and b) closing the gap that commonly exists between centimeters and meters (literally the job of the decimeter...)**

EricKow	37	8	83	"Let's keep this realistic: what I have in mind is present 2013 common interactions with a broad public.  How things are, and not how they should be.  And by socially acceptable, I guess meaning that people won't (consciously or otherwise) think less of you (as strange, awkward, nerd, asshole, etc).

And this is about what people actually do.  I am referring to metric-on-the-outside (not just whatever internal standards an industry might use). And or course this is only about the case where there is an alternative customary measure that is used instead.

One example that comes to mind is soda. Maybe very small volumes too (mL)? [Recreational drugs](http://www.theonion.com/articles/metric-system-thriving-in-nations-inner-cities,458/) as the Onion humorously  points out?  I wonder if the military had any impact on social acceptability of metric units in civilian life (for example, military-inspired gaming?)

Of particular interest would be grey areas where both customary and metric units are commonly accepted. I have an idea that one place to focus on when making a point of using metric units is these areas. 

I realise a lot of this probably falls out of basic [metrication-in-the-USA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrication_in_the_United_States#Current_use) stuff on Wikipedia; that the de facto social acceptability ties in with the official acceptability in a domain.  Nevertheless I think it could be interesting to focus in on the social acceptability side of this question…"	t5_2r25p	True

I thought the Boston Marathon didn't do metric. Apparently it does. So, I investigated further.

Here is a link that shows the location of all of the distance markers. Markers do exist at every kilometre.

http://www.boston.com/sports/marathon/course/milemarkers/

Here is a link of a Canadian runner from 2012. Note how he used only the metric system for keeping track of his performance. This would be almost impossible if there were no kilometre markers.

http://runningcallendar.blogspot.com/2012/05/boston-marathon-race.html

Interesting is how John Hancock gives running time for the media all in kilometres with only one entry for the one mile.

http://www.johnhancock.com/bostonmarathon/mediaguide/2-kilometerpacechart.php

This link shows that the race is 42.195 km and mentions no other units, but what is interesting as that no records are ever given to Boston winners as the race is not properly certified by the IAAF.

http://www.adventure-marathon.com/Boston-Marathon.aspx

So, it seems that Boston does accommodate the racers who come from 96 countries by providing them with information in metric as well as proper signs along the way. Since the pace chart does show times for every 5 km, per the IAAF rules, it is obvious that Boston does to some extent follow the rules, they just don't have their course certified.

I recently asked for a quart of slaw at a restaurant drive-thru the other day. I was informed they had pint sizes and regular sizes. The proper response would be to just give me two pints of slaw when I asked for a quart. Instead, I had to specifically request this at the pickup window.

SI Alternative: I ask for 1000 mL of slaw and I am handed two 500 mL containers of the side dish.

In another instance, I was placing a new backing on a nightstand and needed a custom cut at a home improvement store. I converted my mm design specs to decimal inches for the convenience of the store's employees. The screens of electronic devices in the store are listed in decimal inches (such as a 4.3 in. screen) and yet I was met with bewilderment since the material I described was wood. Instead I had to convert decimal inches to inches and dyadic fractions of an inch which flirted with the design tolerance.

SI Alternative: I provide the original mm design specs and two whole numbers are used to express the two dimensions for the cut instead of six.

Field Exercise: Next time you visit the deli, ask for 11 oz. of meat or cheese. This is a valid, native ""U. S. Customary Measures"" quantity and desirable for expressing, in whole numbers, a mass less than one pound. Assess the accuracy of your order when scales display decimal pounds.

I figured I'd make a new post about it. I don't really think it would be as hard as most people think. I believe the problem with metrication of time is that people usually want to redefine the system based on the current definition of a second. If we assume to keep our current measure of a day instead, because of its significance in our biological processes, then redefine the minute into a milliday. (The new clocks based on this would probably have a 20 hour day with 50 minutes each.) Then again redefine the second into a milliminute or microday. (Realistically, I think people would probably count 100 'centiminutes"" on the clockface rather than cutting minutes into 1000 parts, but maintaining the standard way things are done in the metric system, and further splitting minutes into a measure of 1000, for the unit of seconds, would probably make math easier for scientific purposes.) Then the only really nonstandard measure would be the number of days in a year, which could easily be changed as well if we were to disregard Earth as the standard for the measure. (This would be absolutely possible in the future when humanity is a spacefaring species.) Please tell me if this needs clarification. It all makes sense in my head. lol"	t5_2r25p	True

I live in the US, and I understand how screwy the whole Imperial system is.  However, one thing that surprisingly makes a lot of sense in normal day to day life is the Fahrenheit temperature scale.

What I mean is that for any given day, the temperature in the US is going to be somewhere ROUGHLY between 0F and 100F.  Zero, of course, is COLD, and 100 is HOT.  It can be colder than 0, but not often and not by much, and the same of 100.  In Celsius, however, the temperature range is -18 to 38.  It's a smaller range, and less situated for the human's comfort range.

I think that Celsius makes a lot of sense for SCIENCE.  But for the temperatures we see on most of earth, Fahrenheit seems to work quite well.

What all kinds of Americans did this at once?  Came out of the metric closet, so to speak, and encourage other people to actually give it a try?

* Make a 30-day challenge for people to convert their home to metric and see how quick and easy it is (kitchen and bathroom scales, thermostats, thermometers, weather apps, etc are all capable and it can probably all be switched in 20 minutes).  Try it for a month.  Look up how far your commute is in kilometers.  Keep track of your weight; convert your height.  Just try it for 30 days.

* Try to have a *huge* launch for it; try to move the metric discussion out into the mainstream as far as possible

* Big American names (not just scientists but any celebrity supportive of science or education) mention it on twitter, on talk shows, do AMAs on reddit, get it out in front of the public.

* People who already like metric should be encouraged to really go as metric as they can.  People who have done that can offer to show their friends how.  Make it a facebook thing.  Get it trending on twitter.  Talk to strangers; someone mentions how damn hot it is, you say ""Yeah, got up to 40 C, it was really a scorcher.""

* Stickers, posters, handouts, all that stuff for teachers to encourage students to try it, for private individuals to put on their cars, everything.

* The upshot would be to put an American face on SI; show how easy it is; bring ""choosing to live life in metric"" into the public conversation

Where is the outcry against metric in the rest of the world?  Why is it only the UK and US that even have anti and pro metric organizations?
 
In addition, if the US is so USC and metric is so well hidden to the American population, why is the subject on these people's minds?  Are they encountering more metric than they think they should?  And if they are encountering it more, then where is it coming from?

**It's universal**

(Nearly) everyone in the world uses it. If you travel abroad or communicate online, there will be no confusion as to what you mean when you say you live 10km from the train station. This is also very useful in science, scientists can easily understand the units used in papers published by anyone if they all agree a common system.

Currently, only the USA, Burma and Liberia have not officially adopted the SI Unit system. In addition, Canada and the UK have only adopted it in some areas. Hopefully, eventually everyone will use it!

**It's easier to work with and convert**

The subunits in Metric are all based around powers of ten. Milli, Micro etc. are based around negative powers of ten and kilo, Mega etc. are based around positive powers. Not only that but the [Metric prefixes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix) are the same for all units, so 1km is 10^3 m and 1kg is 10^3 g. This is very different to Imperial units where there are strange, varying and seemingly arbitrary multipliers (eg. 1 mile is 1760 yards). This also makes metric to metric conversions easier. Multiplying and dividing by ten is very easy, as we use base 10, so it's just a case of moving the decimal point 3, 6, 9... places in the correct direction.

**It has a larger range of units**

With its prefixes, you can have very large and very small units, all the way from Yotta: 10^24 to yocto: 10^-24 . This also allows you to use more whole numbers, which are often easier to work with. In different contexts you can pick the prefix you want to use and stick with it. Say I'm building something, I choose to use millimetres. Areas will be in mm^2 and volumes in mm^3 . I don't need precision less than 1mm, so I will always deal with whole numbers and won't need to do conversions. Whereas, particle physicists may want to use femtometres, and won't have to worry about 0.000000000000001m (or worse, 3.93700787 × 10^-14 inches).

**It's based on natural constants**

Each of the [base units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit) are defined in terms of a repeatable experiment, which can be performed anywhere to return the same value. This way, scientists can perform said experiments to calibrate equipment and they know that their equipment measures exactly ""1 second"" or whatever (to within the limits of precision of their apparatus). For example, 1 metre is defined as the distance travelled by light in 1/299,792,458 of a second. This also means units will never vary, and their value can be determined far more reliably than imperial units which use vague and varying quantities (the grain for example, which ounces and pounds are based on, was the mass of a single seed of a cereal or now 64.79891 milligrams, an awkward arbitrary number).

There is one exception to this however, at the time of writing. The kilogram is defined as the mass of the ""International Prototype Kilogram"", a piece of metal in France. This is a remainder of the old way units were defined, and the [CIPM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures) is working to find a better, more precise definition.

**Its derived units work nicely**

Say we have a formula, the one for kinetic energy: E=0.5mv^2 . m, mass, is in kilograms (kg). v, velocity (speed), is in metres per second (m/s). Kilograms, metres and seconds are all SI Base Units, so we know the unit of E, energy will be in Joules (J). This is easier than saying kgm/s, and far easier than other units for energy. The calorie is ""the energy needed to increase the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 °C"", whereas the Joule is determined purely in terms of Base Units. [Derived Units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_derived_unit) are really just shorthand for different combinations of Base Units.

The best method I determined is to change your vehicle's GPS to display Kilometers instead of Miles.  Now I use it every day driving to and from work and it is my preferred unit of measurement.  We cannot change too many products we buy or signs we can control but our devices we can normally set.  

When people ask about it I tell them a few reasons.  I say that Kilometers seem like they go by faster when driving.  I have a beautiful British lady talking and she prefers Kilometers.(Yes, I know they use Miles.

Since the Food Marketing Institute (FMI) seems to be the major obstacle to amending the FPLA, I thought it would be useful to see the arguments that they have used against the amendment. I couldn’t find a link on their website, so I have reproduced below a letter written by FMI to NIST as long ago as 2002. Readers will see that it is full of misconceptions, notably that permitting metric-only labelling will require US manufacturers to change either their labels or their package sizes. The misrepresentation is so obvious that one can only conclude that it is deliberate and disingenuous. I wonder what attempts have been made to expose it.

Dear Mr. Butcher:

Re: Metric-Only Option for U.S. Food Manufacturers On behalf of the Food Marketing Institute (FMI)1, I am pleased to provide the following
comments on a metric-only option for U.S. food manufacturers of consumer goods. As you know, any change to the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act must be made by an act of Congress.

FMI does not support the use of metric-only. Metric-only would not be of any value to the U.S. retailer community or to most consumers in America. Below is an outline of numerous points of concern that FMI has regarding the metric-only option:

1 Food Marketing Institute (FMI) conducts programs in research, education, industry relations and public affairs on behalf of its 2,300 member companies — food retailers and wholesalers — in the United States and around the world. FMI’s U.S. members operate approximately 26,000 retail food stores with a combined annual sales volume of $340 billion — three-quarters of all food retail store sales in the United States. FMI’s retail membership is composed of large multi-store chains, regional firms and independent supermarkets. Its international membership includes 200 companies from 60
countries.

? The majority of consumers do not understand metric measurements. Moreover, consumers are not demanding that their food products be packaged and labeled using the metric system.

? Value-comparison between similar products of various sizes may be difficult to determine for consumers if some manufacturers use the metric-only option and others use inch/pound.

? Retailers will be faced with consumer complaints when value-comparison cannot be determined.

? International interpretations of metric requirements would likely result in package size changes.

? Changes in package sizes will make certain display cases, such as the dairy case and push-in display racks obsolete.

? Metric will also impact other types of equipment in the grocery store, including bakery pans, scales, scanners, computers, and other types of measurement equipment, requiring costly conversion or replacement.

? Shipping cases will even have to be replaced if metric-only is an option.

? A metric-only option may conflict with domestic feeding programs.

? Packagers may change display-only in metric units and that will require changes in unit pricing labels.

? There is a cost for the retailer associated with label changes, including design cost and plate changes (plates can cost in the neighborhood of $1,000).

? Retailers typically keep a label inventory of about 50 weeks.

? Retailer’s operating companies forecast what business might be like in the future (ex: tomatoes) and make future labels accordingly (thus, more label inventory).

? In addition to unit pricing, a metric-only option will also impact UPC codes and price advertising as well as nutrition information and recipe programs.

Page three

As outlined above, converting to metric is more than simply changing labels to make metric the primary method for declaring net contents on a package. Compliance costs necessary to convert to metric are significant, exceeding $1 billion for the food industry. These costs will be passed on to consumers, including food stamp, WIC recipients and the elderly, who will see their purchasing power dramatically reduced
when buying groceries, with no added value.

As you know, the federal government attempted to convert to metric in the mid-1970′s, and the metric experiment was a dismal failure. There is no competitive advantage to be gained by mandating or allowing for a metric-only option for consumer products that are
bought, used or consumed in the United States, especially food products. If a manufacturer needs to label a product metrically to be globally competitive, the company will do so.

Thank you again for your consideration of our views.

The intelligent rebuttal:

2013-03-15 at 18:54	

@Erithacus
Disingenuous? Sir, you are too kind. They are either liars or illiterates. Their position paper demonstrates remarkably little reading comprehension of the proposed amendment.

If my memory serves, they had this or a slightly updated version on their website circa 2005. Several people critiqued their position and they took it down or put it behind the firewall (most of their info is members only). If the bullets on page 2 are numbered 1-13, they are easier to respond to.

1) Consumers aren’t clamoring, but the metric is already there. There is no real resistance on products which have already entirely or primarily migrated to round metric sizes (soda, bottled water, fruit juices, olive oil, many personal hygiene products) and they are spoken of in those metric sizes. I believe no one would care if the Customary went away.

2) No products use ONLY inch-pound. That would be illegal. All products currently have both. If some products had only metric, the metric on the dual products would serve as a basis for comparison. Since #2 is wrong, #3 is dismissed.
4) NIST has made clear that the amendment does not require round or standard metric sizes. A 1 lb/453 g package could just be labelled 453 g. However, over time, manufacturers might prefer a rounder, more sensible size., whether 400, 450 or 500 g.

5) Manufacturers fight for shelf space. They would work with their retailers in deciding the physicals of a proposed new package. They change sizes all the time now and the world doesn’t end. The “pound” of coffee shrank to 13 oz, then 11 oz. The “half gallon” of ice cream shrank to 3 pt. There are clearly some logical metric sizes within the range of Customary size changes that no one bats an eye at. This would also negate #7.

6) The law requires no size or unit change. However, if metric-only became widely accepted, the store might eventually have to change units on random weight and weighed-at-retail items. That would take years and they could decide the timing, probably just order new equipment that works in either unit system.

8) Can’t comment except they should develop details and demand Congress fix it if they can really substantiate their concern.

9) Unit pricing law allows unit pricing choice of one or two Customary and one or two metric units in all cases. “Like product” in the same store must all make the same choice. Retailers could switch to metric unit pricing now or in anticipation of the law. However, if they wish, they could make their lives hard and take on the burden of converting units.

10, 11, 12) Oh bull. My store changes prices every week, and responds to other stores price changes. No way do I believe this is all known and planned 50 weeks in advance. This claim boggles the mind.

13) If the package size is not changed, since it is already labelled in metric and Customary, erasing the Customary changes nothing. As new sizes are gradually introduced, some changes will be required. Where the public already refers to round metric sizes (2 L soda), the stores advertise that way, NOT as 67.6 FL OZ (2 QT 3.6 FL OZ) although all three are on the bottle.

We all know they are lying. We don’t know if they talk their Congressman into voting against the amendment.

I thought it would be useful to start a thread to serve as a guide for switching over various aspects of your life to metric.  This is not meant as a unit conversion guide, but rather a list of tips and advice for adopting SI units for your daily life.

The basic principles of metrication are:

1. Do not convert back and forth between metric and US customary or imperial units.
2. Avoid using the old system as much as possible.
2. Learn to comprehend the new measurements by familiarising yourself with various points of reference.

I'll get it started with a list of what I know about in the comments.

The reasoning is that inches can be expressed in decimals to any number of digits as needed for a particular accuracy.  True, but how many inch users are comfortable enough and skilled to work in inches to five or 6 digits?

Americans are never taught decimal inches when young and a common ruler never shows decimal inches, only fractions.  Thus Americans are taught a low precision method of measuring.  With fractional inches, the attitude is close enough is good enough.

Even if later in life, a person learns to work with decimal inches they never develop the same feel as they do with fractions, and in my experience always refer back to fractions when dealing with decimals.  Also, there is a disconnect between those who understand decimals to some degree and those that don't.

An inch draftsman once told me that non-fractional inches were not real inches.  Real inches in decimal were just decimal equivalents of fractions.  This came about when he insisted I tell him in inches the distance of some mounting holes on an electrical component where the mounting holes were 50 mm apart and the inches were 1.9685 inches.

In metric design, the millimetre is small enough to accurately and precisely produce most products without resorting to decimal parts.  The nearest inch equivalent is 1/32, which when expressed in decimal is 0.03125 inches.  A number to 5 decimal places.

I can't recall ever seeing an inch measuring device, such as a micrometer that measures to 5 decimal places.  If they exist, they must be very rare and possibly expensive and no machinist I encountered had one.  This means the inch has to be rounded to three decimal places, where 1/32 becomes 0.031 inches.  This severely reduces the accuracy of manufacturing.

If it was necessary to punch a series of holes in a line and the spacing had to be 4-7/32 inches ( 4.21875) and the number had to be rounded to 3 places, to 4.219 inches, the error would increase such that the holes would be off towards the end.

I'm sure you can make it work, but with what extra, costly effort?  

With millimetres none of these problems exist.  Everyone from a young age is taught decimals, so everyone understands.  There is no disconnect.  Decimal millimetres are rarely to less than 1 mm but if so, one decimal place is sufficient.  The only time I've encountered more than one decimal place in millimetres was when the number was a conversion from inches and unnecessary extra digits were stated.

ACWM Americans for Customary Weight and Measure Wrong. Japan, South Korea, even France resisted metrication. The collapse of communism has led to the Russian Pound or Russian Stone being reinstated for church bell weights.

The Spanish Pound (Libra) is used in South America alongside the Pound Avoirdupois.

Japanese homes and acreage is measured in tsubo.

Basically, a square fathom is used in South Korea for office and floor space. There has been huge backlash to their attempts to replace it with the square meter.

Destroying the cultural heritage of traditional measures through abolition is like banning books. Have you read ""1984?"" That is probably why even diehard UK Metricators often shy away from abolishing the pint.

We can't think of any countries that collapsed due to metrication, but we can think of many that had it imposed on them, and the types of tyrants that attempt to make that imposition. Look at SI's start, the French Revolution. Did that result in a more ordered nation, or result in chaos and a reign of terror? Look at what the theory of a perfect set of scientific ideals and how it actually manifested itself. It caused such chaos that Napoleon himself devised ""Measures Usuelles"" (sp?) in an attempt to allay the populace's confusion.

We are committed to diversity and culture, not a cold scientific mandate dominating the rule of law. USC are a part of our past, they remain in the present, and we are committed to ensuring their future, whether that means educating the population on our wonderful system and why it is designed the way it is, launching petitions and campaigns to counteract any attacks on the continued legality and existence of our system, or even taking to the streets to halt the attempts to metricate or alter our national heritage and infrastructure. Thankfully, we haven't had to take to the streets to prevent illegal roadsigns, our regulators have figured out that metric signs aren't used and have removed them as they wear out on the only interstate to use that signage, in New Mexico or Arizona.

In the '70s, when your movement was at its strongest, the population here woke up and became very vocal that they did NOT want sweeping changes made arbitrarily, bureaucratically as it did in Canada, the UK. Some industry converted where it suited them, others did not and continue to use our system today, both here and abroad.

Just as IKEA has no problem selling all-metric products, even passing out cardboard metric yardsticks in its stores, we are sure American manufacturers have no problems exporting their wares elsewhere. For a great deal of manufacture, exact units are of no consequence to the general population as long as they are smaller than a certain size.

What do you see the reversal of metrication mandates in Canada and the UK as signs of? The intentional embrace of societal and economic collapse by these nations, or the embrace of practicality, culture, and heritage by craftsmen and artisans?

In my travels, it appears that the US sells inch only tapes (School rulers tend to be dual), South America and Asia tend to have dual and Europe tends to be metric only.

I'm sure it isn't this simple, so I'm looking for more details on who uses what. In metric countries where dual tapes are used, how often is the inch scale used or is it ignored?  On dual tapes, do you prefer the metric on the top or bottom of the tape when holding the body of the tape in your right hand and pulling the tape out with your left?

So I know Reddit has folks in industries that can make a difference. Here are my 2 contributions (so far):

1. For a large technology manufacture in the US we purchase raw materials (trying to be vague)...One day I submitted a ticket to our IT department to convert a whole bunch of part descriptions from Imperial to Metric as part of a name standardization. As an fake example I converted something like ""Milk bottle"" to MILK_3.79L_BOTTLE...I did that for about 1200 raw material part descriptions all using either kg or cubic meters(gases). IT guy didn't care. All good and the change stuck. We even have suppliers quoting in metric now. Very easy on my part.

2) internal environmental service group was developing new tracker of raw materials, needed to know how much Milk was used per month etc..I got tagged with defining a bunch of the software requirements. Of course I have the programers do all the work in metric and then for the final report convert it so it can be submitted (I know not quite there, but someday it is a quick flip of a switch to fix it, the last one ws a gov deal).

I know there has to be folks here that work in industry. Just do it. Imagine if someone in large commercial company like P&amp;G just decided. Be the change."	t5_2r25p	True

Common metric products are often divisible into equal rounded thirds, where USC or imperial are not. Examples:

A UK pint of 570 mL is divided into equal thirds of 190 mL. A 750 mL bottle of wine into equal thirds of 250 mL each. 1.5 L of wine into 500 mL each, 375 mL also divides equally into thirds of 125 mL each. 330 mL divides equally into thirds of 110 mL each.

An ounce, pint, quart and gallon can not be divided into 3 equal rounded parts.

450 mL or 450 g can be divided equally into thirds of 150 mL or 150 g each. A 30 mL or 30 g serving can be divided equally into thirds of 10 mL or g each. A ""cup"" of 240 mL can be divided into rounded thirds of 80 mL each.

The one place where a USC/imperial size can be divided into thirds is the length units, but in each case a name change must result. A foot into thirds only works if the result is in inches. In metric though, common rounded sizes are also divisible into rounded thirds without a name change. In building and construction where the 100 mm module is used, 600 mm, 1200 mm, 2400 mm, 4800 mm are all standard sizes and can be divided into rounded thirds.

A 30 cm Subway sandwich can also be divided into thirds of 100 mm each.

Can we think of more practical applications where metric sizes are divisible into rounded thirds and where the equivalent USC/imperial can not?"	t5_2r25p	True

If you're at the gym and looking at weights, or someone has just told you their weight and doesn't know how to convert. So for those times a rough guide is:

**Half the value of lbs and minus 10% of the value.**

It's not perfect, but if someone says 40lbs you can quickly think 40 -&gt; 20 -&gt; 18kg and if they say 180lbs, 180 -&gt; 90 -&gt; 81kg (the actual values are 18.1 and 81.6, so it's not bad). Also gets you practicing mental arithmetic.

Liters per hundred kilometers = 9 syllabels

The metric fuel efficieny ""unit"" demands twice as much effort to pronounce as its imperial cousin. It doesn't flow very well in sentences, in fact it's not easy on the tongue at all. 

That's why slang evolved. We've got ""kilo"" for ""kilogram"" and ""klick"" for ""kilometer"". Is there any common slang for ""liters per hundred kilometers""? ""My car does five to the hundreds"", or simply ""my car does five liters""?

(Task of calculating this distance took more than six years)	jrkv	5	1	2	"[Wikipedia link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_metre#Meridional_definition)



[This pdf shows how they calculated this distance](http://mathdl.maa.org/images/upload_library/22/Schwartz.pdf)

**Copied text from that pdf**

The French surveying project involved an elaborate series of ground measurements using sightings of light signals from hilltops, church steeples, and other high points. Distances were expressed in terms of the standard toise, an old iron bar kept near Paris. The key mathematical method employed was triangulation, a technique in plane trigonometry used to determine the position of one point from those of two known points. Frisius, mentioned above for his horological solution of the longitude problem, was also the inventor of triangulation. His method requires, in addition to the positions of
the two known points, only the two adjacent angles of the triangle they form with the third point. The French surveying teams were able to measure these angles with great accuracy thanks to the use of a repeating circle, an instrument with a
pair of rotating telescopes that had been cleverly designed a decade earlier by Borda, the Commission Chairman mentioned above. The French meridian measurement entailed hundreds of observations in a vast mesh of triangles. Because the location of each new survey station was calculated relative to previous ones, in an iterative fashion, the team knew that imprecisions would tend to magnify during the surveying process. Thus, results had to be repeatedly cross-checked and adjusted. Such long-range Earth surveying, or geodesy, emerged as one of the most fertile areas for the development and use of applied mathematics."	t5_2r25p	True

http://www.dukeandduchessofcambridge.org/news-and-diary/the-duchess-of-cambridge-has-been-delivered-of-son

Was this the actual mass as measured in the hospital? British hospitals tend to weigh babies in grams and the 6 lb 6 oz would then be a conversion of 3800 g.  But is this the true mass?

Australian sources seem to have added another figure to the list of masses: 3.74 kg

News.com.au:  “He weighs 8lbs 6oz or 3800 grams (3.74kg)”

Where did the 3.74 kg come from?  It obviously does not convert to 8 lb 6 oz.  Is it the true mass, leaked by a hospital employee to the Australian media?  If it is, then is 3.74 kg the true mass and both the ""official"" pound/ounce mass and its converted metric equivalent are wrong.

Why didn't the hospital report the official mass as was read of the balance and recorded? If need be convert it to whatever they want it to be and have both for people to choose?

However, there is one style of measurement that I genuinely believe standard to be better for: temperature.  I get that the Fahrenheit seems random, next to the very ordered Celsius, but the fact is, outside of a scientific setting, the freezing/boiling point of water hardly matters.  0-100 in Celsius goes way past anything a human would be able to survive for very long.  On the other hand, 0-100 in Fahrenheit is perfect for the range of human survival.  Obviously it can go a bit above or below, but for the most part, you can look at the temperature as a ""percent heat.""

Many people use a modified version of the SI system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of SI which is widely used today is often called ""The Metric System"", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the SI system, developed by the BIPM.

There really is a Metric system, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the measurement system they use. The Metric System is the name.

Normal amount of seconds in a year: 31,536,000.

So that means we need 1,536,000 more seconds, or 15,360 more minutes, or 153.6 more hours, or 15.36 more days, so lets add an extra month with 15 days; and every 2.7778 years we add an extra day! Problem solved! 

The months could be 'prefix'-ember

e.g. Monember; Hexember, Octember, Triembre
