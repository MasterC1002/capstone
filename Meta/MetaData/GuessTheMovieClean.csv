1353020077.0	139kpk	Rant: FUCK THIS SUBREDDIT!	DevilWorshipper	150	28	41	"Seriously. I have spent the better part of my life watching movies. I **used** to think I was well-versed in movie/film reference and culture. I am able to identify many movies just by the respective studio/distributor/producer. I come to this subreddit **every day** to try and identify the movies you guys post in single-frame and it **drives me fucking crazy!**

In the six months or so I've been coming here, I have not been able to even offer a guess on the majority of posts here. Inevitably, when I get stumped on one or two, I'll refresh all day long just because I'm dying to know the answer. *This is no way for me to live.*

NO MORE! Don't get me wrong. You guys are fine, intelligent folks. I've nothing against any posters or guessers here, rather, I've plenty against the forces that have conspired to demonstrate to me on a daily basis how much **I don't know** about my beloved cinema.

I am unsubscribing so as to avoid this feeling of powerlessness. I wish you folks well and godspeed in your endeavors."	t5_2s570	True

1342810306.0	wvy4v	GuessTheMovie v2 coming soon!	roger_	73	11	11	"Hey everyone,

We're currently testing out a new addition to the subreddit: we'll be using a bot to handle the scoring and settle the whole Google Image Search issue.

The bot will do the following:

1. Check for images on GIS
1. Assign points (1 - 6) to the winner *and the OP* based on whether GIS finds the image
1. Automatically check-mark identified posts
1. Record wins in the scoreboard
1. Record everyone's total points as flair

We can also award bonus points under different conditions (e.g. for really tough posts, for identifying within 2 minutes, etc.)

---

Points will work  like this:

* Image on GIS: [1 point for winner](## ""green""), [2 points for OP](## ""blue"")
* Image not on GIS: [6 points for winner](## ""green""), [3 points for OP](## ""blue"")

---

Here's the new procedure for when posting a shot:

1. Post shot on imgur or link directly to the image file (GIS is optional)
1. Confirm guesses (reply with a messages saying ""yes"" or whatever).
1. Click on the green ""report"" button on the first correct guess.

After the last step you should get a confirmation from the bot within  ~4 hours. If you don't then you should   inform the mods.

Also, guesses should all be done as top level comments now.

---

Known issues:

* Text posts aren't supported.
* ~~GIS will sometimes find the same shot posted on this subreddit.~~

###**How to Make a GuessTheMovie Animated GIF:**
***

Okay, so there may be other ways of doing this, perhaps even easier ways, but this is the way I make my animated GIFs. So here I go:
***

**1. Capturing the Stills:**

First I should say that I often go for static shots which can be played in a smooth loop, i.e an object/person moves but the camera stays still.

To capture the images I use VLC player (Download it here: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/). When playing the video, I slow the speed right down - stopping and starting the playback of the video to take a snapshot of each frame using VLC’s “Snapshot” function to capture the stills. You can use a hotkey to make taking snapshots easier, which I believe is either “Alt-Shift-S” or “Shift-S”, but you are able to change the hotkey if you want.
***

**2. Ordering the Shots:**

If you want the animated GIF to go in a smooth, seamless loop, then the stills have to be ordered a certain way. The easiest way to do this is the following. 

Say you have 5 stills, it would be like this – going forward then in reverse:

* STILL 1
* STILL 2
* STILL 3
* STILL 4
* STILL 5
* STILL 4
* STILL 3
* STILL 2

Although, this would look odd if the camera or something in the frame which you didn’t want to move is moving, which would need the next step to solve...
***

**3. Editing the Stills:**

So, if you feel that the images loop smoothly then you won’t need to do this part. But if it doesn’t, or you only want one bit in the frame to move and the rest to stay still, then this is how you do it:

First you’ll need an image editing program, such as Photoshop or GIMP. I’ll lay out the basic steps:

1.	Start a new project.
2.	Import each still.
3.	Make each individual still a separate layer.
4.	Now you erase the portion of the top layer that you want to animate to reveal the same portion of the layer below.
5.	Merge the layers and save that as an individual image.
6.	Then you keep erasing the same portion to reveal the next layer below, and keep merging and saving as individual images.
7.	Then when you have all the edited stills saved, turn them into a gif.

This process and end-result is basically the same as something known as a “cinemagraph”, which you’ve probably seen before – perhaps at [THIS WEBSITE](http://iwdrm.tumblr.com/) which is what inspired me.

Here are a few good in-depth tutorials explaining how to make these “cinemagraphs”, with examples:

* http://fernandojbaez.com/cinemagraph-tutorial/
* http://www.tested.com/news/how-to-make-your-own-cinemagraphs-a-new-take-on-gifs/2253/
* http://veryrobert.com/2011/07/09/how-to-make-a-cinemagraph-with-gimp/ - (for using GIMP)
***

**4. Converting Stills into an Animated GIF:**

If you think that the GIF will be too big and want to resize the stills, and you can’t use an image editor to batch resize or it takes too long, then you can use this website:

http://www.picresize.com/

Now, you could download a program to make the animated GIF (and if you know a good one then feel free to do so), but I just use the following website:

http://www.myspacegens.com/handler.php?gen=animatedimage&amp;p=view

I usually put each still at something around 125 – 150 milliseconds, depending on how the result looks. Just fiddle around with it until it looks right.
***

**5. Other:**

If you think some of this process is too long-winded or not right for you, then just do it how you want to do it. For instance, there’s probably a way to convert video straight into an animated GIF by using a program – and if that works well for you, then do it. Search online and figure out a way that feels best, like I did.

If anyone has any questions, critiques or helpful advice then please say so."	t5_2s570	True

**If this goes well, I'm planning on making a few more of these posts in the future.  We'll start out somewhat easy with this one:**

* links between films will be cast only, no crew

* all actors and actresses are (what I would consider) well-known

* as often as possible, make note of the connections between movies in your comments

* to help focus this a little bit: **after I finished, I noticed that all movies were released between 1990 and the end of 2000.**


**Thanks to grokfest for unintentionally giving me the idea for this post.  Hope everyone has fun with it!**

* Use imgur (also on 'edit the image' setting), and crop the photo to make it slightly more difficult than a regular ol' screenshot of the movie (some of these people in here are damn good)

* Use tricks like mirroring the image so that it becomes far more difficult to look on on google image and tineye. 

This will help in keeping it difficult to cheat. Cheers!"	t5_2s570	True

If Google finds another copy online, then people can probably use it to identify your movie :(

One thing that *seems* to help is flipping image left-to-right. You can do this using an image editor, or directly on imgur.com (see [this guide](http://i.imgur.com/ZqEjz.png)).

Alternatively, you can just try taking another shot that hopefully won't be automatically identifiable this way.

**EDIT**: You can also try [TinEye](http://www.tineye.com), though it seems to be less accurate than Google.

**EDIT 2**: You can also use [Google's browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dajedkncpodkggklbegccjpmnglmnflm) for searching"	t5_2s570	True

Lynda73	23	0	32	"Last night, crudnick sent a message to the mods about this cool little app called [hyperdesktop](http://www.downloadcrew.com/article/20640-hyperdesktop) that takes screenshots and automatically uploads them to imgur. That got us to thinking it would be nice to have a tutorial of sorts for posting screenshots here. So, GTM, how do *you* take screenshots? We hope to get enough information here to link to this post on the sidebar as our tutorial, so feel free to be detailed! 

Edit: I've been using the hyperdesktop and do recommend it if you don't already have a system in place. Ctrl+shift+3 takes a screenshot, ctrl+shift+4 takes a selective screenshot, and ctrl+shift+5 takes a window shot. The images are automatically uploaded to imgur and the links are listed in the hyperdesktop control panel."	t5_2s570	True

1341933998.0	wbxfd	We'd like some feedback: what should GTM do about Google Image Search?	roger_	22	2	41	"We've tried to be as hands-off as possible and just remind people to check, but it seems that we have to try some other options. 

On one hand there are people who just want things to be left casual and to ignore GIS and potential cheating; and on the other there are folks who want things to be as fair as possible. (Personally I don't understand why someone would bother cheating for something like this in the first place...)

These are some the options we've come up with:

1. Remind people to check Google Image Search and use the honor system (current approach).
1. Remind people to check GIS and don't count points from shots that are recognized.
1. Remind people to check GIS, and award extra points for shots that aren't recognized (e.g. 2 or 3 points vs. 1).
1. Require people to use it, and remove posts that GIS recognizes (could possibly be automated).
1. Ignore GIS, and no one mention it in the comments (honor system again).
1. Ignore GIS and abandon the point system.
1. ???


The big problem is that lots of shots are on GIS nowadays, and even more are continuously being added. Also it's frustrating for people to have to check and ensure their shots aren't recognized, and may even discourage people from posting altogether.

I'm in favor of options **2** (no points for recognized shots) or **3** (extra points), but there's still the issue of requiring someone to check GIS to see how many points should be awarded.

We'd like to settle this once and for all, so please tell us what you think."	t5_2s570	True

1337608222.0	txhls	A few things to help keep the competition fair...	KillFist29	23	3	5	"First off, please don't let anything said in this post be taken offensively or personally. This is my favorite subreddit of all time, and everything here is said out of a love for the community and a desire to keep the (ultimately meaningless) challenge as fair and fun as possible.

* 
Please check Google for your images before posting them. I noticed that nothing like this is stated in the guidelines over to the right, and I hope a mod or someone sees this and can make an amendment. If the image does pop up in Google, or can be found through other Internet detecting means, I think it would be fair to disqualify any points that would be gained towards the weekly competition. This is obviously something that would depend on the vigilance of individual users.


* When taking a screenshot, please make sure the file name does not contain the name of the movie or any other identifying features. If this is picked up by anyone, please mention it in the comments so that the points would not be counted.

* When making a title for your capture, please don't make it something from the movie that could be Googled or easily recognizable. This doesn't happen very often, but I have seen it a few times so I figured I'd go ahead and say it.


That's all I wanted to say, and I'll take this moment to reiterate that this is my favorite subreddit and I want nothing else than to see it flourish and to see the competition get even more spirited than it already is. You guys are cinephiles after my own heart and I look forward to stumping (and being stumped by) you with more GTMs. :)"	t5_2s570	True

I have a request, Please vote on the game you are playing, I have noticed that the game gets very little votes, I'm talking a game with 5, 10, 15 different movies and 10 or so different winners only have maybe 5 votes. Remember, the person posting the game has went out of there way to give you a little fun and entertainment and the least you can do is say Thank You, and how do we say thanks on Reddit?

At the end of the week, the results will be summarized by the mods and a new scoreboard will be started. (If there aren't many scores reported, then the competition might be extended another week.)

---

A few rules to make things easier for the mods:

* Please **group wins** by the same person under the same thread (use CTRL-f to search!). Please make sure to do this, there have been several duplications in recent weeks tallies.
* **One person per thread** please! If you're reporting scores for 5 people, then please make 5 different comments.
* Important: all postings of points must contain a link to the thread where the guess was made, otherwise they will not be counted.

At the end of the week, the results will be summarized by the mods and a new scoreboard will be started. (If there aren't many scores reported, then the competition might be extended another week.)

---

A few rules to make things easier for the mods:

* Please **group wins** by the same person under the same thread (use CTRL-f to search!). Please make sure to do this, there have been several duplications in recent weeks tallies.
* **One person per thread** please! If you're reporting scores for 5 people, then please make 5 different comments.
* Important: all postings of points must contain a link to the thread where the guess was made, otherwise they will not be counted.

 * The new king is DarrylRevok with 28 points! Amazing. She certainly gave duddles a run for his money. 

 * duddles is number 2 with 25 points. Congrats! This is the fourth week duddles is in the top 3. He clearly has some staying power and is not to be trifled with.

 * FelixBeatageist is number 3 with 8 points. His first time in the winners bracket. Congrats!

Thanks for playing everyone, we hope to see you again next time.
