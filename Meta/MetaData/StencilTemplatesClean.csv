1346204259.0	yzurd	Open letter to the mods. Hoping someone will read this.		57	17	14	"Listen, I hate to be the grump here, but I just came back after ragequitting this SR a few weeks ago and now I see [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/StencilTemplates/comments/ygx4b) is Stencil of the Week.

[Adding bridges does not mean the stencil is feasible.](https://i.minus.com/iA1FEHnqcuHQ0.jpg) It's not some platonic thing. Bridges need to hold up the shapes, not just theoretically bridge an island. This is not a template for vector art, and although the image looks very nice, it is not a physically plausible stencil and should not have been selected.

As long as I'm ranting, the SOTW is biased towards one-color stencils, since multicolor stencils cannot be represented. I haven't really made multicolor stencils but it seems like they are not able to be represented there.

Mods, I see tons of images with either islands or shapes that would immediately bend or rip if actually physically cut and used. These are on the front page regularly with no moderation or even warnings from mods. Do we really want to let this become an anything-goes vaguely cuttable vector art subreddit?

I'm probably quitting again, but think about moderating a little bit and getting some better content. Sorry for being pissy."	t5_2t7dg	True

Not only do we love to play disc golf, but it is common practice in the disc golf community to custom dye our discs. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/EBHJ0) and [here](http://imgur.com/a/7HFVZ) are some examples. 

A week or two ago the existence of this subreddit was brought to my attention as a fantastic resource for stencil ideas and for help with our custom craft. I would just like to extend my thanks for any past and future help your community provides us.

Links to this sub have been added to the r/discgolf sidebar as well as added to our [disc dyeing guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/q0l7l/rdiscgolf_help_me_put_together_our_very_own/).

**Version 3.0 (8/4/2013)**

**27 MB - 486 Total Font Files**


This is a volume of stencil fonts. It was created in the hopes of having an organized method of collecting and cataloging fonts that can be shared with the stencil community. It's meant to be updated, and can be done so by anyone who is interested.

This collection comes with an application that does not require installation and allows you to [preview the fonts in this pack](http://imgur.com/sLG7Qp3) without having to install them. You'll need to run it once and point it to where this folder is located on your computer. In the settings have it ""open last folder"", or just add the folder to the favorites list at the bottom. It can install fonts directly from within the program, or view all fonts with your own custom text.

**Collection Contains**: 386 TTF, 52 OTF, 12 PFM, 10 PFB, 2 AFM, 2 BIN, 1 HQX, 1 FON

From monitoring the submissions and posts, we've created ""Template Collections"". These are groups of templates that fit into the same category. These are available in the [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/StencilTemplates/faq). Some examples are [Animals](http://www.reddit.com/r/StencilTemplates/search?q=%28Animal+OR+Animals+OR+cat+OR+dog+OR+bear+OR+zebra+OR+lion+OR+raven+OR+crow+OR+dinosaur+OR+cheetah+OR+leopard+OR+elephant+NOT+Vonnegut%29&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance), [Video Games](http://www.reddit.com/r/StencilTemplates/search?q=%28video+games+OR+gamers+OR+gamer+OR+gaming+OR+portal+OR+xbox+OR+playstation+OR+wii+OR+capcom+OR+namco+OR+donkey+kong+OR+oddworld+OR+skyrim+OR+fallout+OR+pokemon%29&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance), [Music](http://www.reddit.com/r/StencilTemplates/search?q=%28music+OR+musician+OR+musicians+OR+gorillaz+OR+jack+white+OR+biafra+OR+elvis%29&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance), and [Political](http://www.reddit.com/r/StencilTemplates/search?q=%28politics+OR+political+OR+revolution+OR+ows+OR+goldstein+OR+bama+OR+obama+OR+ron+paul+OR+protest+OR+police+NOT+weasley%29&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance).

We're at about **700 subscribers** and growing consistently. All this, in just **52 days**.

But we're not done yet! We are always looking for insight and ideas from the community. Here's some of the things that might be coming up:

* An improved sidebar, with clear easy to understand rules.
* Making the words ""Stencil of the Week"" in the sidebar link to the previous winners section of the FAQ.
* Creation of a series of tutorial videos regarding various techniques in Photoshop, Illustrator, and other applications (including cross application techniques).
* Use of StencilTemplateBOT to post links to related stencils in the comments of posts. So that if someone finds their way to a Darth Vadar stencil, they can see that there is also a yoda, luke, and  chewie stencil available.
* Adding additional tags to posts in our excel spreadsheet to help StencilTemplateBOT learn.
* Potential for a Stencil Font of the Week in the side bar, if the community wants it (would be nice to have a font enthusiast on the mod team for this). If you're interested check out the [Stencil Font Collection](http://www.reddit.com/r/stencils/comments/nh1zt).

A lot of the data in this post came from an excel spreadsheet the mods maintain. It helps give us additional statistics and data that reddit doesn't. In the interest of openess, a static copy is [available here](http://www.mediafire.com/?2yf4mg1sbyk3cbd).

1356072215.0	157ruv	[META] Best of /r/StencilTemplates 2012	d9-thc	31	5	6	"Hello /r/StencilTemplates subscribers! When I created this subreddit a year ago, I never expected it to get this big or to have such an awesome mod team with /u/jaredcheeda and /u/J_Anthony (and how could I forget the lovable /u/StencilTemplateBOT). 

To be perfectly honest, I haven't been the most diligent moderator. I believe in a more hands-off style of moderation, and I believe the community will generally police itself (which works great, for the most part!). However, I have not had the time or the energy to put into this sub what /u/JaredCheeda has. He is responsible for the CSS, Stencil of the Week, and pretty much all the other things that make this subreddit awesome.

This year, Reddit has decided to do something different with their annual BestOf competition, allowing each individual subreddit to run its own contest. They are supplying 5 reddit gold credits to be distributed to the winners. You can read more about it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/14cha9/community_best_of_2012_awards/).

I will have to speak with the other mods to decide how we will run the best of 2012 competition in this sub, but I'm thinking it could be something like voting on all the Stencil of the Week submissions to gauge which are the crowd favorites. 

Feel free to leave your thoughts below. Thanks for the great year and for all your original content submissions which have made this such a great subreddit!

EDIT: Perhaps instead of voting on all of the Stencil of the Week posts, we could have different categories, such as ""best poster"", ""most improved"", ""most requests filled"", etc."	t5_2t7dg	True

Because I see numerous posts each day, with tons of islands. And everytime someone points that out, the OP just says ""Oh, it's for a bleach shirt, so it's cool""

What's to stop this from becoming just a black and white vector art subreddit then? Would [these](http://i.imgur.com/JW8xx.png) [submissions](http://imgur.com/4YDOD) that were downvoted, and [berated](http://www.reddit.com/r/StencilTemplates/comments/w1ag1/o_mario_mushroom_mario_mushroom/c59fyja) be acceptable if someone said ""It's for a bleach shirt""?

We need a decision here: Should ""bleach stencils"" (that is to say, stencils with apparent islands) be allowed here? I'm not saying someone's first attempt at a stencil that might have some islands they didn't see. I'm talking [apparent island stencils](http://www.reddit.com/r/StencilTemplates/comments/z3b5u/o_planet_express_logo_futurama_comedy_central/)

1364678025.0	1bblix	[MODPOST] Hi guys. I'm your new moderator. What don't you like about /r/stenciltemplates?	dcurry431	24	3	17	"I have a few ideas for revitalizing the community and a few grips about how it's currently run, and I figured the best way to implement successful changes would be to ask what's on everyone else's mind.  Here's some complaints that I have:

*  **Stencil of the week is stuck.** JaredCheeta is the man when it comes to CSS editting and reddit modification, so I'm afraid there's nothing I can do to fix the issue right now.  Should we still have a stencil of the week?  Should it be stencil of the month?  I've disagreed with some selections in the past as they tend to just be pop culture references, not well made stencils, though that brings me to my next point.

*  **Low quality stencils.**  I'm fervently against islands, but I've learned to live with those who are not.  However, some stencils [just](http://i.imgur.com/fGBnwND.jpeg) kinda [suck.](http://i.imgur.com/xNDdlvh.jpeg)  Should shitty stencils be removed from here?  I'd make an effort to be polite in my policing and offer tips on improving bad stencils, rather than just deleting ones I don't like.

*  **Karma-whoring request posts** JaredCheeta made our awesome Lincoln-y submission buttons, but some people still ignore them and post requests as links.  The whole point is to not get karma for requesting something, only those who make or find cool stencils should be rewarded like that.  I think these posts should be deleted at sight, and don't be afraid to report them.  Do my fellow subscribers agree?

*  **Stencil stealing.**  Not a lot to say, other than fuck [this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/StencilTemplates/comments/18ptd6/o_knock_knock_breaking_bad_walter_white/)  I think these should also be deleted at sight.

---------

In general, I think a more hands-on moderation is required, but I made this post to ask what everyone else thinks.  I'm sure there are cool ideas out there that I haven't even thought of yet.  Post 'em!

*This is a self post, so I won't get any karma from it.  I'd appreciate if it was upvoted so it's more visible.*

------

New thoughts:

Don't upvote comments that claim to be people working on stencils until they actually post a stencil, going through the backlog of the mod queue there's a ton of those comments that never delivered and most are upvoted.  There's a lot of reasons to abandon a stencil but disappointing other people isn't alright."	t5_2t7dg	True

Can anyone turn this into a stencil for me? Is it possible to do two layers, not sure if I want to put the red in or not - I have a feeling it would look a lot better if i could.

Also - would the finished product be ""Scale able"" as i'm a pretty big guy (6'4"") this my jacket is a bit bigger than the average bears.

Thanks for looking/helping !

That first one might be difficult, this would also make a great one, it might be easier? I've no clue how this works.

First off, [here is an imgur album of all the entries](http://imgur.com/a/2AIHh).  Thanks to everyone who participated, every single stencil is quality stuff.  They're going to be judged like an art show competition with a jury. The mods will give each a score from 1-5 for each of the following categories;

-Interpretation and clarity of the theme to the viewer.

-Creativity and originality of the depicted theme.

-Quality of the stencil template and the overall composition based on the theme.

-Overall impression of the art (what is the effect of the design as a whole).

Currently, there are two active moderators in this subreddit, and every now and then /u/Jaredcheeda descends from the Heavens to save our butts with some programming wizardry.  The reason we are using this scorecard system rather than just taking the image with the most upvotes is because the upvote/downvote score is often decided based off of the source image rather than the quality of the stencil.  If you guys think that's unfair, please comment and let us know so we can work out something better.

I'm happy to say /u/Blinnlambert already got next month's sponsor set up! They're giving prizes for the winners **and all participants!**  The theme will be announced on June 5th with the winners, but I can [give you a hint.](http://i.imgur.com/WMeecxY.jpg)

I'm getting back up to speed on our subreddit right now, checking out all the cool new stencils, and also getting the voting for July's competition under way. We'll be making another announcement with July's Trifecta winners soon.

On that note, we are transitioning the Template Trifecta Throwdown to a bimonthly competition. The reason for the change is so that we can make sure there are sponsors lined up for every competition and also to allow time for people to create really breathtaking submissions. The next Template Trifecta Throwdown will be announced in September.

But first, let's announce the winners of the Space Age theme! We had lots of really cool designs and the final tallies were all very close, so without further ado, here is the Trifecta for June, 2013:

1: [""Cosmos"" by riffraff70](http://www.reddit.com/r/StencilTemplates/comments/1gyhaw)

2: [""Hello Dave"" by Squishy_Squid](http://www.reddit.com/r/StencilTemplates/comments/1gwy44)

3: [""Rising Empire"" by and_winter_came](http://www.reddit.com/r/StencilTemplates/comments/1gv39s)

We will be sending you guys a PM with info on redeeming the prizes. Congrats!



**Now, onto July**.... we DID have a sponsor lined up for July but when I tried to confirm with them last week I never got a response. I've been holding off hoping they might be on vacation but still no word back after the holiday weekend. So, right now it looks like christmas in july is cancelled, kids :( I still created a theme for us and if our sponsor gets back to us soon, I will definitely make sure we have goodies for the winners of this month. But it's not about the prizes, right? It's all about that [juicy juicy karma](http://i.imgur.com/WTaqjam.gif)!

So for this month, our theme is [MYTHOS](http://i.imgur.com/dX0k5YM.jpg). Create a stencil template relating to myths, legends, sacred symbols, sunken cities, anything with a fantastical deep story!

Again, I really feel bad that our competition this month is late out of the gate and I just want you all to know that I'm workin' on lining up more sponsors for future events."	t5_2t7dg	True

When I get close to something doable he ends up looking like Kryten from Red Dwarf - anything that looks like Delon is a mess.  (I'm an idiot at photoshop etc.)

Any who -- I decided to try to make one myself. I'm a total noob when it comes to this stuff. I have no idea what I'm doing, and have only printed and cut one stencil.

This is what I came up with:

[Jpeg](http://www.ftscanada.org/iwo_jima_template.jpg)

[PSD](http://www.ftscanada.org/iwo_jima_template.psd)

I know nothing about Photoshop or how to make a template, but this one seems to have worked for me. It's a ""reverse template,"" where I'm cutting out the black and panting around it (my terminology is all off. Like I said, I'm no stencilsmith.)

For the PSD template, it has the paths. Just select the main path, and subtract the paths labeled ""Subtract This 1"", ""Subtract This 2"", etc.

Hope y'all like it!

If there's anything wrong, let me know. This was fun and would like to try this again.

I'd like the width of it to be twice the height, as well. I wasn't able to find a reference image to make a stencil from but if I fabricated one it would just end up cartoonish.

He's going to be running SotW from now on, and it's up to **you guys** to make awesome stencils to get featured.  Speaking of community contribution,  many other subreddits have monthly contests, and it'd be awesome for us to have one.  Prizes are still being figured out (hopefully something cooler than just a flair and sidebar mention) but I'm thinking we should have a monthly contest to stencilify an absurd image.  Any thoughts on that?  How about nominations for first image to be contested?

Cheers everyone,  dcurry431
