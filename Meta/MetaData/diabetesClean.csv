I'm going to share one of the most insightful top 10 lists I've ever come across.... It came in pamphlet form at my diabetic nutritionists office - titled ""Diabetes etiquette for people who DON'T have diabetes""    

*  **DON'T** offer unsolicited advice about my eating or other aspects of diabetes: You may mean well, but giving advice about someone's personal habits, especially when not requested, is not very nice. Besides, many of the popularly held beliefs about diabetes (You should just stop eating sugar) are out of date or just plain wrong.    

*  **DO** realize and appreciate that diabetes is hard work: Diabetes management is a full time job that I didn't apply for, didn't want, and can't quit.

*  **DON'T** tell me horror stories about your grandmother or other people with diabetes you have heard about: These stories are not reassuring.

*  **DO** offer to join me in making healthy lifestyle choices: Not being alone is one of the most helpful things for me.

*  **DON'T** look horrified when I check my blood sugars or give myself an injection: It's not a lot of fun for me either. Checking sugars and taking medications are things I have to do to be healthy. If I have to hide while doing so, it makes it much harder for me.

*  **DO** ask how you might be helpful: If you want to be supportive there may be lots of little things I would probably appreciate your help with. However, what I really need may be very different from what you think I need, so please ask first.

*  **DON'T** offer thoughtless reassurances. When you first learn about my diabetes you may want to reassure me by saying things like ""Hey, it could be worse; you could have cancer!"" this won't make me feel better. And the implicit message seems to be that diabetes is no big deal. However, diabetes (like cancer) IS a big deal.

*  **DO** be supportive of my efforts for self-care: Help me set up an environment for success. Please honor my decision to decline a food choice, even when you really want me to try it. You are most helpful when not being a source of unnecessary temptation.

*  **DON'T!!!** Peek at or comment on my blood sugars without asking me first: These numbers are private unless I choose to share them. It's normal to have numbers that are sometimes too low or high. Your unsolicited comments about them can add to the frustration, disappointment, and anger I already feel.

*  **DO** offer your love and encouragement: As I work hard to manage my diabetes, sometimes just knowing you care can be very helpful and motivating"	t5_2qhsj	True

* Please, do NOT act shocked or outraged if I just ate some ice cream or other carb-y snack (I'm T1, monitor my glucose, and take appropriate amounts of insulin for things like this). I appreciate the concern, but really, I know how to take care of my body.
* If you know I'm diabetic, feel free to offer me food/candy/junk/whatever, but if I decline, DO NOT try and push it on me. If I'm low and don't have sugar/glucose on me (and I almost always do), I will ASK. But if my BG is good/high, then I generally don't want to make it go higher with a carb-y snack. I appreciate you offering me something, but when I decline, then please stop trying to push the food on me. I've had people say ""well, can't you just take some insulin?"" YES, but would you really want to give yourself a bloody shot every single time someone offers you food?
* Please don't tell me about some miracle diabetes cure you heard/read about, and how I should try it. It doesn't work, and unless you yourself were cured of diabetes because of it, I don't want to hear about it.

Anyway, sorry for the rant! Generally when I explain this to people, they understand, and don't do these things in the future. But I'm just a little sick of how many people come along and do this. I guess such is life!"	t5_2qhsj	True

1373404400.0	1hymbk	Boyfriend is now in surgery to get a new pancreas. I still can't believe he will not be diabetic tomorrow. Wow.	Kwizi	86	4	50	"My boyfriend has been blind due to diabetes for ten years (he's 35). His kidneys were also quite messed up. So some years ago, he decided getting a pancreas transplant would maybe be a good idea. Although he's blind, he's really good at doing things independently. BUT gets these hypos every once in a while (he doesn't feel it coming) which makes it not so safe to live alone. I met him through his guide dog, I had raised her then had given her away. After about half a year I was allowed to contact him to get news about his dog. We hit it off quite well :) She definitely feels his hypos coming, but was not properly trained for it (only for guiding) so she does try to alert him, her signals are not always clear (well, she sits on him and won't get off, that's her latest signaling behavior she came up with to alert a hypo).

Anyway back to the transplant. He had been on a waiting list for 4 and a half years almost. A couple days ago, he got ""the call"". 60% chance that it would work, the reason is that they still had to check the organs and such, but my boyfriend lives over 3 hours away from that hospital, so they have to call him in advance so he can be on his way already. His brother's car was broken (and obv he doesn't have his own) so he had to call a taxi. Except... false alert, on his way there, the doctor called again and told him with these organs it would not work out. Crap... he went back home.

A couple hours again, new call! This time the organs were great and the surgery should go under optimal conditions! He left 5 hours ago. Since then, I have no news yet. I have to be patient. I'm writing here, because I was googling about the surgery a bazillion times and all the links are purple, and I still can't kick this off my mind. It's related to diabetes, so I figured this would be the subreddit for it (also I must say, this is the friendliest subreddit on whole reddit!!)

2. Wake up at 3 am drenched in sweat. Realize you’re low, bolt into a sitting position at record speed while ~~reaching~~ flailing for your glucometer. Send glucometer flying across the room. Turn on light.
 
3. Try to recover glucometer without getting off the bed.  Aim blood covered finger for little tiny strip. Miss two or three times, then get it.
 
4. Results. 40?! Snack time! Oh yeah!
 
5. Move with perceived lightning speed to the pantry on the other side of the house. Be sure to run into every door way and table corner on your way. It’s best if you can stub a toe or two. Snag pump tubing on door knobs. You’ll need some battle scars for the morning. Do not turn on any lights until you reach your destination! 
 
6. Open pantry and grab the glorious juice box, put that straw in like a pro and slurp down in 6 seconds. Not your best time, but good enough.
 
7. Pick some food…..Rice Krispies! Frosted flakes would be better but they will do. Make your way back to the kitchen for the giant bowl and milk. Prepare the cereal. Remember seeing  fudgecicles in the freezer the night before. That sounds good too, grab one.
 
8. Don’t forget  to put the cereal box away somewhere strange. See apple on the counter, consider eating that too. But, not enough hands, it must stay.
 
9. Bring food back to your bed room, don’t bother with tables. Lights get turned back off if they’re lucky. Eat as much as you can as fast as you can but savor all of it. Food is WONDERFUL.
 
10. Blood sugar is returning to normal, realize what you just did, Take some insulin to cover your feast, roll over and go back to sleep.

1367265272.0	1dcxfg	Today is my 10 year diabetes anniversary. I wrote this and posted it on my Facebook wall. (none of know that I struggle with my diabetes, so this is me coming out with how I really feel.)	diabeetus-girl	82	9	27	"(Sorry about the long post, but I needed to write this.) I normally don't post personal stuff on FB for the world to see, but I am making a post because today is kind of a unique day for me. 10 years ago today, when I was 9, I was diagnosed with Juvenile Diabetes. It just hit me now that it's been so long and it's a weird feeling. I have been through ten years of highs and lows that have made me feel like crap, ten years of having to constantly worry about everything I eat, ten years of wishing I didn't have to poke myself with needles all the time, ten years of wondering why me?

I know there are many people that have it worse than me, and thank God I don't have it worse, but being told you will be different for the rest of your life is tough to take as a kid. I have always tried to stay positive about my diabetes and hey, everyone knows I love joking about the 'beetus... but truth be told, it is always burning in the back of my mind that I'm most likely stuck with this for life. Not a day goes by where I'm not thinking of the consequences I might have to deal with; that I'm more likely to die before the rest of my friends. That I could lose a toe if I step on something. That I could lose a leg or an arm because my sugars go too high. I might go blind. I might go so high that I go comatose, or so low that I have a seizure in my sleep and don't wake up. These are the most terrifying parts of this disease. I can deal with the needles and shots. But not knowing the future is scary to me.


10 years ago I was simply being told that I'd have to suck it up and take shots every single time I eat, and that was the worst part as a 9 year old. They said, ""It's not a big deal, just watch what you eat and take insulin!"" I didn't realize that there are things they don't tell you when you are in the hospital. That emotionally, keeping your head straight is worse than the physical pain.

I may not be the best diabetic, and I'll admit I do not have control of my diabetes. These past 10 years have been a rollercoaster ride of good control and bad control. And it sure will continue as I get older. I will never have perfect control, and whatever consequences happen to me because of it, will happen. But as of today, my diagnosis anniversary, I am going to look forward to things that I want to do with rest of my life instead of constantly worrying about things that COULD happen. 


It has been a battle, and it's only been 10 years. I hopefully have many more years ahead of me where I may or may not be diabetic. I hope with all my might that they find a cure soon. But if they don't, and I have to spend 50 or 60 (hopefully that long a life!) more years with diabetes, than bring it on. I have been through a lot, and there is nothing I can't handle now. I spent my childhood afraid of the future. Now, I am not afraid. 

I am proud of myself for fighting this crap disease for a full decade now, and I am thankful for all my friends and family that have helped me through it. I have scars all over my skin from the thousands and thousands of needles. I have callouses on my fingertips from blood sugar testing. But I literally and figuratively have thicker skin now, and I know in my heart that everything is going to be okay. ♥"	t5_2qhsj	True

When people ask me why, it has always been for one simple reason: because things need to change. I’m running to tell those of us who are overweight, who are borderline diabetics, or have a history of diabetes in our families that it is never too late to change. In this country and around the world we are entering an era in which diabetes is an epidemic; a period in history when the number of people with diabetes is projected to double in the next 20 years. Yes, it has gotten this bad. So I’m speaking with my feet – my one shot to tell the world now is the time to change the way we eat, exercise, and think. This is my 1Run."" -Doug

1328063224.0	p5i7y	Introducing the r/Diabetes Challenge: A Collective Effort Towards Better Diabetes Care	Sippin_Haterade	79	7	83	"Hey everyone, let's try something new this February!

Strong diabetes management can be a battle for many of us, since it's something that many other people don't understand and we have to endure alone (without other diabetics). So for 3 weeks during the month of February, **I challenge you to make a conscious effort for stronger diabetes management**. You know how friends often make pacts agreeing that they will all shed a few pounds or quit smoking? That's exactly what this is like- a collective effort to improve diabetes care. 
 

I just ask anyone who wants to participate to please [fill out the survey before the challenge begins](http://bit.ly/xi4BYo). The survey is *crucial*, because otherwise we won't be able to see the results of the challenge.

----
**Goals for the Challenge**

* At least one person experiences an overall improvement in glucose levels.
* Participants as a whole experience better glucose control during this period.
* That some participants continue the habits made during the 21 days after the challenge.

----
**How the Challenge Will Work**
 
 
* Promise **yourself** three weeks of better diabetes management.
 

* Those participating will [fill out an anonymous survey](http://bit.ly/xi4BYo) before and after the challenge. If you are a lurker, please feel free to participate too!

* The first week will be used to collect the data and spread the word about the challenge. **The official start of the challenge will be on February 8th**, ending at the end of the month.

* I will post a breakdown of the data at the end of the month to show any changes in average glucose levels of the subreddit to see how we did as a whole.


* Those that they are participating in the challenge will be issued [blue flair](http://i.imgur.com/IF8V0.png). 

* If you feel stuck at any point, or are [experiencing burnout](http://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/search?q=burnout&amp;restrict_sr=on) then please make a post or join the [IRC chat room](http://bit.ly/wubCAs) (where there are many kind diabetics who are helpful, supportive, and free of judgement.)
 
----
**Some Things To Consider**

These are a few minor changes in care that have great marginal benefit:
 

* Check your sugar at least 3-5 times a day.
  

* Check your sugar before eating meals.


* If on insulin, don't eat food without bolusing/injecting appropriately.

* Be dilligent and proactive with your medication.


* Make more of a conscious effort to count carbs.


* Try not to beat yourself up and dwell on high readings or bad control, but rather think of ways to improve next time. 


* Be open to include more exercise/healthy lifestyle choices during this time period.


----
 
We already have a few people who are on board with the challenge- *awaxa* and myself included- so this is definitely going to happen. Even if no one else accepts the challenge, I will still be posting the (few) results! So... will you join us in the effort aimed towards better diabetes care and a healthier, happier life?

I have no idea what the purpose of it was or if they share profit with the anti-suicide line, but it's laughable and ridiculous.

I would not recommend showing it to children. They provide no information, no education, no support. The whole thing is a random dementor like monster offing people on the street...to bring awareness that diabetes kills. Please set your pumps to stun for this thing and please let IDF know they have no business in the PSA business.

Forewarning: This probably gets a little graphic at the end..... But I wish for nobody to experience what I have.... and if it'll help you than I'm glad.... It's not really written as a ""SCARE YOU"" story.... but as a ""this is the shit I've gone through story."" I was warned since I was a kid.... ""If you don't take care of yourself, you can go blind or lose a limb."" My great grandmother lost one of her legs to diabetes.... but being a male, and being young and dumb.... I knew it could never happen to me.

I've been diabetic since I was 10, I'm now 25.

For the most part, when I was diagnosed I took very good care of myself. I always had *AWESOME* A1Cs and the doctor would brag about me to her other patients. (I was going to a juvenile endocrinologist.) For the most part, I took care of myself, and my parents would ask me good questions, and treat me like an adult. They cared, but they stood behind me and watched me do what I had to do.

I continued this up until junior year (I believe) of high school. That year my friend got diagnosed as a type 2 (he was a big over weight). It all started to go downhill from there.

We would leave early to go to lunch (being a diabetic), so that we could stop by the nurse's office (she kept our glucometers and insulin in there) and check our blood sugar. We would always get stuck in the middle of the line (or the end of it). He started skipping the nurse's office and convinced me to do the same. He told me ""Now I'm first in line at lunch every day, and it beats going last every day"". I started doing this a few times a week, and it gradually became every day. I still checked my blood sugar at home, and I'd still stop by the nurse's office and check it if I felt extremely low or high and do what I needed to do to correct it.

Looking back, this wasn't the smartest of things to do and it started a lot of bad habits down the road (which, thankfully I've since quit).

Continue this for another year and then some. I graduated high school at 17, and did not have a good relationship with my mother at the time (I spoke to her maybe once a year on my birthday) and the relationship with my father was also shitty.

The girlfriend I had at the time, her mother was stationed overseas in Afghanistan. Her father was on the other side of the US. I live in SC; her father was in WA and didn't really give a damn about her. Her mom suggested I move in with her just so she didn't have to live by herself and to make everyone happier. All the bills were paid for; she was given a food allowance for the both of us.

I was carefree and wanted to be more ""normal"". I had an insulin pump, and had been on it for many years (5 at this point?). Everyone knew I was diabetic, but for the most part I ""hid"" my diabetes. I would operate my pump via silent/vibrate mode stealthily in my pocket, and I wound up checking my blood sugars less and less. Needless to say, it got to be where I'd check my blood sugars *maybe* once a month.

This continued for awhile, we finally broke up. I had nowhere to go, I moved in with my father. At 18, I got a job working in a recycling company on 3rd shift. My father worked 1st. This worked out well, because I'd be at work while he was asleep. When I'd come home, he'd be at work. We rarely saw each other.

He'd always ask me ""Are you taking care of yourself son?"" As a naive and stupid teenager I'd get angry at him and say ""Of course..."" He'd ask what my blood sugars were and I'd make up some good number and he wouldn't question me again.

At this point, I probably hadn't gone to the endocrinologist in a year or two. I was always under my mother's health insurance, and everything was mail order prescriptions. When I'd run out, I'd call the endo and she'd write more.... I'd always come up with an excuse not to make it to the next appointment.

My father knew something was up, because I had a buildup of test strips/lancets/other stuff but the pump related supplies and insulin would always be close to zero by the time the next shipment came in.

I ended up losing my job, and as I saw more of my father again.... the relationship turned to shit.

My father demanded I pay like $200-300 in rent (I don't remember). I told him that for that price, I could get a place of my own and wouldn't have to live by his rules. He laughed at me and said that I wasn't responsible enough to make it on my own. I figured ""I'll show him!"" and within 2 weeks I had moved out. (I was probably 19 at this point).

I get my own place with a roommate and live by my own rules at this point. I check my blood sugars even less frequently... seriously.... everything was by “feel"". I bet I checked my blood sugar once every 2 - 3 months if something felt really fucked up.

This continued for over a year until finally I was out of insulin.... The doctor would not write me another script unless I actually came to visit her.

I visited her, but never brought my glucometer or log book. I'd always say ""Oh damn, I left it at home. I'll bring it next time."" The A1Cs were always good, the blood sugar when I checked it in her office was always ""acceptable"" so she never really questioned my care and assumed I was taking care of myself.

Fast forward a year or two more. I was 20. (Diabetes running damn near unchecked for 4 years now). I start having vision problems out of one of my eyes.... I ignored it, and it only got worse and worse. My girlfriend finally convinced me to go to an eye doctor and I did.

I went to Sears and got an eye exam. (I thought I only needed glasses). As soon as I went back and did the eye exam, I knew something was seriously wrong. The Dr was looking in my eye, and his demeanor completely changed.

He left the room, and came back... He had this ""look"" on his face. He said ""You need to go see an eye specialist... you need surgery. Your eye is bleeding"". I was fucking SCARED at this point...... He schedules an eye appointment with a specialist, and they tell me that there is nothing I can do.... I had glaucoma (in both eyes) and that I'd had a stroke in my left eye. He said it would gradually get worse, and I would eventually need surgery on it. He told me it was because my diabetes had gone unchecked.

I was still kind of smug at this point, and started half assing checking my sugars... They were *ALL OVER THE PLACE*! I'd have crazy highs, and super lows.... (400s.... &amp; 20s).

I couldn't feel any of this shit..... The reason my A1Cs were always good was because I had drastic lows that would even it out.

We've been getting a lot of posts lately that ask the community questions along the lines of ""I am experiencing x, y, &amp; z symptoms, do I have diabetes?"" or ""Should I see a doctor?"" The answer to the latter question is generally, ""*YES. You should see a doctor!*""

We would just like to remind anyone seeking out a diagnosis that **we are not medical professionals**. We are just a community of people who are diabetic or know someone who is diabetic. We kindly ask that you equip yourself with a little more information about symptoms, diagnoses, and diabetes before you make a post to the community.

Just remember that everyone experiences symptoms differently, and we can never truly know if you have diabetes. This IS your health we are talking about and if you think you may have something as serious as diabetes, then it probably deserves the attention and diagnosis from a REAL medical professional. However, we do understand that some people may be uninsured, anxious, scared or in need of seeking out reassurance from a supportive and helpful community such as r/diabetes.

Therefore, I am using this post to hopefully reach those who are seeking help/diagnosis, and to provide them with resources that can aid them, and to also rid the subreddit of some of the repetitiveness we've been seeing lately. So my question to you, the r/diabetes community:

*What are the best resources you could provide to someone who is unsure of whether or not they have diabetes? Or to someone who is looking for a diagnosis in general?*

I will compile a list of proposed links and edit them into this post. Then I'll make a banner at the top of the subreddit that links to this post, targeted towards people seeking information about diagnosis.

I would ask you to please upvote this post (I do not receive any karma as it is a self post) so that new visitors to the community can see this.

Regards,

S_H

I just finished working a small temporary job at a children's hospital in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. I won't give the name, but I will say that it is rather well known for it's refusal to bill patients in need. 

Now I don't know how if any of you have ever worked for a hospital, but the health screening is brutal. For a 4 day temporary job I was forced to disclose my entire health history, have several vials of blood drawn, undergo a full physical, and receive more innoculations than I've ever had in my life. I can't complain, it's a children's hospital.

During the health screening the subject of my diabetes came up. The nurse who was working my screening asked how I had managed to cope without insurance. So I advised her that I was self-medicating with Novolin. 

Long story short, they weren't aware that Novolin was available in Texas on an OTC basis at Walmart for around $25 a vial. 

They had been supplying insulin, through their own pharmacy, at their cost...of $65 a vial. They'd been requiring a new visit for every prescription renewal, which cost them roughly $250 a visit. Given the number of patients that they see each year with diabetes, the hospital administration estimates that this will save them over 2 million dollars a year. 

This money is going to be put directly back into the hospital, allowing them to service more children each year. 

I just thought y'all would like to know. I discovered that Novolin R, Novolin N, and Novolin U are available OTC, at such a low cost, through this subreddit. Had I not come here I would've never known, and that knowledge is helping a local hospital aid several hundred additional children per year. "	t5_2qhsj	True

To figure out how long you need to wait between taking your insulin and eating:


1. Check your Blood Sugar (this is a given)

2. Take the first two digits, going left to right.

3. Wait that amount of time.


So for example, lets say Im 176. I would take the first two digits, 1 and 7, and use those as my time. So I would wait 17 minutes after taking insulin to eat my food.

This tactic has worked wonders on my blood sugars, as I never quite understood the amount of time needed for lead time. Enjoy!

**EDIT:** As a European redditor pointed out in the comments, this tactic is meant for those that use the United States standard for measuring the Blood Glucose level. A couple of redditors replied with a way to make it work however, for you European Diabetics. "	t5_2qhsj	True

I'm sure they look like normal people, but it's hard to visualize since I've always been the only person I've ever known that has it.  It can be an isolating feeling (as you all know), but I get jealous of people who know other diabetics, or at least have seen another one, so I figured I'd try the next best thing.

So, out of curiosity, what do you look like?  I know that's a kinda scary question, and it's ok if no one wants to show their face, but I figured it would add a much needed personal touch to coping with diabetes.  T1 and T2s welcomed!

PANDADA	59	10	25	"My fiance sometimes does these little things that may seem meaningless to the average person, but means a lot to me being a diabetic. We went shopping yesterday and I bought another pack of juice boxes to keep on hand in case of low blood sugar.

While we were putting away groceries I opened one of the cupboards to see the juice boxes, but noticed one juice box was sitting in front of the pack by itself; I was confused because I thought I didn't have any left before buying the new pack. So I asked him ""Did I have one left or something?"" and he said ""No, I opened the pack for you since you probably wouldn't want to deal with trying to open it when your blood sugar is low."" This was just so touching to me, because while it's a very minor thing to do, he really seems to understand how I feel when my blood sugar is low. I, myself, have never opened the pack in advance anyway, which makes it that more funny, but appreciated. xD

And coincidentally, my blood sugar did go low last night and I appreciated being able to just get out of bed, walk into the kitchen and grab the juice box from the cupboard without having to fumble with the plastic on the package. :3 (I normally keep one beside my bed, but forgot to put a new one on my desk.)

1333845835.0	ryla6	r/Diabetes Challenge: The Results are In + Traffic Stats!	Sippin_Haterade	50	4	7	"Hello everyone!

*Just wanted to start by saying that I would really appreciate it if you just took a second and upvoted this post so others can see it. Of course, I do not receive karma as this is a self-post.* 

If you don't know what the /r/Diabetes Challenge is, then [feel free to check out these posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/search?q=challenge&amp;restrict_sr=on) to get a clue. Basically, it was a 3 week effort getting together as a subreddit to try harder for better glucose control. I issued out a survey before and after the challenge so that we could see the results of the effort.

Anyway, I've been very busy and pretty inactive around the subreddit these last few weeks or so, but I was finally able to get all the data from the challenge surveys. It took quite a few hours to sift through the surveys and try to get the most accurate breakdown of results, but it's finally done. Remember, the data I am sharing with you does not necessarily reflect everyone who participated in the challenge, nor everyone in the subreddit- only those who participated AND filled out the survey before and after the challenge.

----

**Here are the results:**

Average BG Before the Challenge: 150 mg/dl or 8.33 mmol/l

Average BG After the Challenge: 137 mg/dl or 7.61 mmol/l

~~Do the math, and this means there was an overall decrease in blood sugars by 13 mg/dl or .72 mmol/l. This translates into a change of 8.66%.~~

[Thanks to Planckover2pi for his input](http://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/ryla6/rdiabetes_challenge_the_results_are_in_traffic/c4ab65f), it turns out that the group actually ended up 29% closer to an assumed target number of 105 mg/dl, or 5.8 mmol/l. 

71% of people who participated and gave surveys had lower blood glucose levels after the challenge. However, many of those who didn't see a decrease in their blood glucose levels, about 31%, had still remained in the range of 80-135 mg/dl, or 4.44-7.5 mmol/l.

**[Here is a graph reflecting the progress in mg/dl.](http://i.imgur.com/syJNY.png)**

**[Here  is a graph reflecting the progress in mmol/l.](http://i.imgur.com/4vOwL.png)**

----

I would say the challenge was success! Thanks to everyone who participated! We learned a lot from the experience and got very helpful feedback in the surveys. We plan on doing this again sometime in the near future, and will keep doing it so long as there are people who want to improve their diabetes care. We understand that it was difficult to stay motivated during this time, so we are discussing the feedback from the surveys and plan on implementing them in the next challenge.

----

**[On a side note, I would like to show you our traffic stats up until the end of February.](http://i.imgur.com/AsRN9.png)** As you can see, this community has been growing at a very awesome rate! Things slowed down quite a bit in March, and March's traffic was slightly higher than January's.


Wow, took me a while to organize this post! Do you have any additional questions about the data? About the challenge? Any feedback on the challenge? Post a comment below, fire us a pm, or [visit the IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23reddit-diabetes).

1358298745.0	16nl83	Emergency room visit today - accidentally hit a vein when injecting. Long story and questions inside.	WattersonBill	65	20	45	"Diabetic of 5 years here, using Lantus and Novolog pens. Last night I believe I accidentally hit a vein when injecting Lantus and ended up calling an ambulance. This is my story, for anyone who runs into this problem in the future. I'd love feedback on what to do differently.


Storytime:

Last night I took my normal dose of Lantus, 58 units, around 1 am. As I injected, I noticed that the injection site on my thigh wasn't bulging, which it normally does. I also felt no pressure beneath the skin, which I normally do. As I pulled out the needle, the site immediately started to bleed. Not just a drop of blood, but a little stream of it, running down my leg. 

My first thought was ""Shit. I might have gotten a vein or maybe muscle."" So I searched some diabetes blogs and found very little information. Every once in a while I'd find somebody post a story about how they accidentally hit a vein and they went hypo almost immediately. 

So, I start to worry a bit, and grab my glucometer:

**1:04am - 140 mg/dL**

""Alright,"" I thought. ""Let's see what it is like after a few minutes. Then I can go to bed.""

**1:07am - 131 mg/dL**

**1:09am - 114 mg/dL**

**1:10am - 106 mg/dL**

At this point, I am shaking (possibly out of fear), breathing heavily and scared shitless. My sugars have *never* dropped that quickly. I start eating raisins I keep next to my bed. 

**1:12am - 89 mg/dL**

I wake up one of the other kids in my apartment and start to explain to him the situation. I start chewing glucose tabs as quickly as I can. I am petrified at this point. 

I decide that if I can't get my numbers to stabilize, then I will call for an ambulance. In the meantime I get out my glucagon and explain how to use it to my roommate between handfuls of raisins. 

""What if I mess up? Why can't you do it yourself?""

""This is for the moment I pass out on the floor.""

""Oh.""

**1:15am - 74 mg/dL**

I keep eating sugary things. I've never gone below 40 and am barely staying calm. 

**1:17am - 66 mg/dL**

I lose it and call an ambulance. I don't want to wait until I can't think straight before seeking medical attention. My numbers aren't slowing down. I check one more time before waiting for the ambulance outside. 

**1:18am - 61 mg/dL**

For some reason I grab a sack of granulated sugar on my way out and sit on the curb. The ambulance comes, and it is just one guy there to take me to the hospital. He talks to me, sees that I'm not literally on the verge of death, and tells me to hop in. 

He is relaxed and doesn't seem to worried about the situation. We arrive and he is cracking jokes about the sack of sugar. I feel about the same as when I left my apartment. I get taken in and a nurse checks my blood sugar. She says it is 68. She jokingly chastises me for eating sugar and ruining my teeth. The is not appreciated. 

The staff periodically checks my levels and gives me glucose water, toast and jam. I slowly rise from 68 to 70 to 77 about an hour later. It's close to 3 am at this point and I am almost falling asleep upright in the wheelchair they told me to sit in. 

Around 3:30 my blood sugar hits 99 and they tell me I can head home. As I'm waiting for a cab, I check one more time. 

**3:31am - 92 mg/dL**

The cab ride only takes 10 minutes and I check the second I get home. 

**3:42am - 52 mg/dL**

I just about fall on the floor. I am so exhausted and full of disgusting sugary things at this point, that I am not sure I can eat any more. 

I boil some water and pour half a cup of sugar in a mug. I melt the sugar with the water and drink it in one sitting. Nausea is really hitting me at this point. But a make another mug of sugar water with about a third of a cup this time, and just sip it.

**3:51am - 63 mg/dL**

**3:58am - 92 mg/dL**

**4:03am - 124 mg/dL**

**4:09am - 148 mg/dL**

I'm not sure when enough will be enough. But I realize that once the insulin is done, I'm going to spike, hard. I am delirious from sleep deprivation at this point and want nothing more than to sleep, but I stay up and keep checking because I know it could drop at any point again.

**4:19am - 170 mg/dL**

I start to get my hopes up about leveling off. I drink a little bit of regular water, knowing that I'll likely get dehydrated overnight. 

**4:25am - 143 mg/dL**

I nearly start crying. I can't handle this anymore. If I start really dropping again, I cannot eat anything more. I already feel like I'm about to vomit all the sugar sitting heavy in my stomach as is. 

**4:28am - 120 mg/dL**

I feel defeated. I start drinking the second cup of extreme sugar water and debate whether I should call a cab or another ambulance. 

**4:31am - 146 mg/dL**

A little bit of hope again.

**4:33am - 158 mg/dL**

**4:35am - 171 mg/dL**

**4:39am - 196 mg/dL**

**4:46am - 212 mg/dL**

I finally broke 200. I have **never** been so happy to see a number that high. I stay awake for another 45 minutes, checking to make sure it didn't drop. And it didn't. I stayed right around 200-215 until 5:30, when I called it a night. 

I set an alarm for 7:30 am, so I could monitor it again. 

**7:32am - 240 mg/dL**

Relieved, I drink a sip of water and go back to bed. By this time I'm feeling nauseous and dehydrated, but better than I expected. I decide to take the day off. 

I check my levels again at 9:30 and noon. They stay between 180 and 240, and never end up spiking. After a cup or two of water, I felt fine for the rest of the day (though I slept until almost 4pm.)

Anyone else had something like this happen?

Any advice for what to do when this happens? 

I might have over-reacted a bit, but still better safe than sorry. I'd love to hear feedback of any kind.

You offered me supplies that you had, you offered to help me over the phone and with forms, alternatives and a variety of other things.

I'm not sure there are many places like this on the internet, where a group of strangers could come together so cohesively and help another. I just wanted to say thank you, and I will always remember the kindness and generosity that you've so provided me.

I've been T1 for 17 years, and I'm 22 now. This shit is just starting to stack up on me. With school, trying to stay fit and active, managing this shit is just too much. All of my friends and family see as this guy who can  manage throughout anything, as this ROCK who can tough out anything. I've never spoke to my friends or close cousins about the hardships of being Diabetic. Ever. Then days like this when shit just starts adding up, my injection sites are sore, and I just don't want to inject one. More. Time. 

What is a man to do? I'm supposed to be this funny outgoing guy who isn't brought down by anything. Who can I talk to? I just want yo tell my friends and family that this shit sucks. That I hate it. That for a few moments every day since I was five years old I hate life. That injecting myself every time I eat a meal sucks. That I just wanna go out and have a good dinner and relax. Without having to get up and fucking stab myself with a needle every. Single. Time. I. Get. Hungry.

Sorry if I'm ranting. But what is a guy to do when I'm the one who has never let his ""disability"" get to him? Am I not allowed to text my brother/sister/cousin saying ""I fucking hate this."" I never do, and never have, to spare them the awkwardness of it. I don't want to create an awkward situation for anyone. I don't want to have people feel pity for me. I mean, I've been living this way for 17 years. Why is it hard now? Why tonight. Why do I feel like crap now? And why is it so hard for me to just text my brother or cousin saying ""being Diabetic sucks"" I don't know.

I don't even know what the point of my thread is, I just wanted to vent. If anyone is in the same shoe's as me, I wish you luck, friend. No one should feel like this. And if you're newly diagnosed, please please please, for me, talk to everyone you can about it. Don't create this weird stigma in your head that people will look at you different. Because as I grew up, I realized that the people who look at you different just aren't worth the time. And the people who will be able to support you need to know that you need that support, ever after 17 years, it can wear you down. I'm sorry for ranting, I'm kind of drunk and alone.

Anyways, to everyone who needs someone to talk to, don't hesitate to reply or send me a PM I know how hard this can be. I don't even remember my life without diabetes, this is all I know.

So my daughter is awake and I ask her if she would please go get me my insulin from the coffee table. Her response. ""Sure dad! What's a matter? Did you catch the diabetes again?""

1370359409.0	1fnm7z	How I track my glucose	sylvar	47	3	48	"I've got a MacGyver system that works for me.

1. When I send a text to [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com/) with a number, and optionally some comments (""204 having a doughnut for breakfast was stupid""), [my *Add glucose readings to Google Drive spreadsheet* IFTTT recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/97254) puts it into a spreadsheet for me. ([screenshot](http://imgur.com/KXzJeVr))
2. Formulas in the spreadsheet break it up into date, time, glucose, and comments. This makes it easier to do statistics later. ([screenshot](http://imgur.com/mhferHo)) 
3. A Google Script attached to the spreadsheet runs every hour to check whether or not to ~~annoy~~ remind me. ([screenshot with part of code](http://imgur.com/Mwj9m4e)) 
4. When the script sends a reminder email, IFTTT sends it to me as a text message using [this email-to-SMS IFTTT recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/97258).
5. When I get that text and heed its reminder, I reply with a number and optionally some comments.
6. Repeat from step 1.

So far I've discovered that Wednesdays are particularly bad for me ([chart](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m35e37iju21qhkpz8o1_500.png)). 

Quarterly A1C isn't nearly instant enough, and individual glucose readings aren't nearly robust enough, but having feedback like this has helped me make better decisions.

-----------------------

***TECHNICAL DETAILS:***

The first tab of the spreadsheet is called ""Raw Data"". The formulas I use in a tab called ""Formatted Data"" are (for row 1):

**Date:**

    =datevalue(regexextract('Raw Data'!$A1; ""(.*? .*?, .*?) .*""))        

**Time:**

    =regexextract('Raw Data'!$A1; ""at (.*)"")

**Glucose:**

    =regexextract(text('Raw Data'!$B1, """"); ""(\d+).*"")

**Comment:**

    =regexextract(text('Raw Data'!$B1, """"); ""\d+ ?(.*)"")

***SOURCE CODE***:

To use this script:

1. Open the spreadsheet.
2. In the Google Drive menu, *Tools &gt; Script manager...*
3. Click New
4. Replace the contents of the script with my script (that is, you'll be deleting the *function myFunction()* stuff) and insert your spreadsheet ID on the appropriate line.
5. In the Google Drive menu, *Resources &gt; Current project's triggers...*
6. Click *No triggers set up. Click here to add one now.*
7. In the *Run* column, make sure to choose *doGet()*.
8. In the *Events* column, change ""From spreadsheet"" to ""Time-driven"".
9. Click Save.
10. In the Google Drive menu, File &gt; Save. You can call the project whatever you want.

* I'll eat dinner, calculate my carbs real quick, take the appropriate amount of insulin, do some short mundane task, and then forget whether or not I've taken my insulin already or not. If it was a big meal (say 120 carbs) I don't want my BGLs to go up to the 400s, and especially don't want to double up on insulin. Happens a few times a year. 

* Hopefully I'm not the only one who has experienced this, but in public, my family often questions how well I'm controlling my BGLs. But *PLEASE*, I don't want to hear, ""are you high again?"" ... after that I obviously get self-conscious about looking around, because everyone immediately thinks I'm some juvenile stoner. I'm just like, ""yes mom, my **BLOOD SUGAR** [holds up meter], is high right now."" 

* Occasionally my low blood sugars will **not** rise. *10:20pm* BGL: 60. Then I'll plow through as many cookies as I can find because that's how I feel when I'm low. Yet for some reason, after 30 minutes my BGL reads: 65. ??????? Okay, more food for me. Let's try juice. 8 oz should be MORE than enough. 30 minutes later. BGL: 70. At this point, I'm already full from dinner, full from snacking to get my BGL up, and I'm seriously considering just PTFO. 

* But now another problem arises: did I eat too many carbs, but my body hasn't responded yet? or am I still going to be low? Now all of a sudden I'm staying up an extra hour to see if my BGL can just get over 100. ""If I get to 100, I'm going to sleep."" BGL: 101. ""YES!!!"" *6:30am* wakes up, BGL: 350... 

Obviously there are MANY more awkward situations/problems that exist, but I just wanted to cover the ones that affect me most often.

I boasted to my friends but none of them *really* get it even though they are super supportive.


I am so super proud of my wee boy, He's now at a stage where he can both test his own blood sugars, know what the number mean, can correctly treat his own hypo (as in knows how many grams of glucose to take depending on how low he is) identify which number is the carbohydrates on a nutritional panel on a food package, identify which foods contain or most likely to contain carbs, record  everything correctly in his notebook and most importantly give himself his own insulin using the pump. 

It's been a long hard road, but we are getting there, and while he still has a lot of learning to do, being able to confidently give him some of the control of his day to day care has been great for both me and more importantly himself.

1374278984.0	1io0ld	Ten years of diabetes today. Posted this status on Facebook, with a little extra for you guys.	Fraydin	43	4	5	"So, today I have officially been diabetic for ten years. A whole decade. 3652 days. Over the past ten years, I've pricked my fingers over 14,000 times. I've had highs, and I've had lows, both blood sugar-wise, and emotionally. And I'm not gonna lie, these years have been tough. I've gone through things I could never have come up with in my wildest dreams.

I wonder how my eight year old self would react, if they had any idea what sort of things were to come in the next decade. This disease has affected me daily, from that day ten years ago, up until this very moment. It's never totally out of my mind, as I'm always having to consider so many little factors throughout my days; things like what I'm eating, when I last dosed, whether I exercised that day, and so much more. And sometimes, as any diabetic will tell you, despite your best efforts, you end up high or low anyways. And that's when it gets frustrating, when it seems that no matter what you do, this stupid illness has a mind of it's own, and all you want to do is give up, close your eyes, and wish it would go away.

Yet here I am, 3652 days later, typing this status. I've fought through the good times and the bad times, and I've done my best to make the most of this reality of mine. I've always tried to joke about my diabetes, and having it has really given me a chance to appreciate life. I've learned so much over these years, and made a difference in so many lives, some of which I would never have known if it wasn't for this disease.

I've made it through one decade, so here's hoping for many more! And who knows, maybe I'll only have it for another decade, maybe two, or maybe even less. Science makes steps forward all the time, and who's to know what the future holds? Everyday is one step closer to a cure, so I plan to keep moving, step by step, day by day. And finally, thank you to everyone who's supported me in any way over these ten years. I honestly couldn't have done it without you.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So on a more personal level with you guys, I just wanna say keep it up. I know it's tough at times. I know sometimes you want to just give it up and quit on life, but stay strong. This disease is a bitch, that's for sure, but together we can beat it. This is coming from someone who's had A1C's from 6 to 12. Surround yourself with those who care for you, and never, NEVER, make the mistake of thinking you're alone in this world. Asking for help isn't a sign of weakness, it's a sign of wisdom; to recognize when something is bigger than just you alone. And remember, you can always come here for help, or just to vent. We've all been there at some point.

So, to those who have had this disease for less time than me, I assure you, you can do it. And to those who have had it longer, I salute you. Let's keep on fighting this battle until our fingers bleed no more. Life is too good to let it be ruined by one stupid pancreas."	t5_2qhsj	True

1375398390.0	1jj0q7	husband newly diagnosed; I'm already sick of well-meaning people	EmailsMyself	48	9	97	"My husband was diagnosed a week ago and we haven't told that many people yet, just family, close friends, and a few co-workers.

Already I am sick of this question:

""Is it Type 1 or 2?""

I feel they are only asking in order to pass judgement, and I silently fume thinking about what they probably would say if the answer were Type 2.

**(edit: in Australia most people know there is type 1 and 2. Basically Type 1 = not your fault, you poor thing. Type 2 = your fault, you fatty fat fat stop eating and start exercising.)**


But it isn't, so the second question is:

""How is he handling it?""

Until yesterday I was honest and answered ""Not well, it is a huge adjustment."" and explain what it has been like as the people asking aren't casual acquaintances.

But the majority of time the next thing they say is:

""Well it could be worse - at least it isn't cancer and he isn't going to die from it!""

How do you stop yourselves from punching these people?? So dismissive!

I switched off the conversation and stopped talking about diabetes but it really irks me and I feel I am getting more pissed off over it than I should be.

I've decided that from now on if anybody asks I'll only give banal answers like ""Yeah he is doing okay."" or ""We'll get used to it."" 

My husband spoke to his diabetes educator about this and also about how he feels bad that he feels sorry for himself, that he knows it is managable and won't die, but knowing that doesn't make him feel any better. She explained that at least with cancer you may have a good day here and there and some relief from it, with diabetes there is no relief, ever. 

My mum, when I first told her and explained what this means to our lifestyle, made me laugh when she said: ""I'd rather have my cancer back than have diabetes!""

Aside from venting, basically I am curious to know how on earth do you curb your temper when people say thoughtless things? Is getting used to dumb comments something else, like counting exchanges, that we'll just have to get used to?

edit: I am reading the book given to us by our educator, and there is a section in there advising the person with diabetes to try not to get annoyed by loved ones who ask irritating questions all the time. Stuff like: ""How are you feeling? What did you have for lunch?"" Had to laugh because that is what I do to my husband!! I constantly ask about his BGL reading and the day before yesterday he flared up at me about it. But we talked it through and now it is a bit of a joke between us as I am the annoying one!

Fraydin	37	3	16	"So I've been having trouble sleeping for the past few weeks, and was recommended to try using Melatonin, as both my mother and sister have had success with it. And in a moment of stupidity, I didn't bother reading the labels, took two, and went to bed.

Long story short, it didn't work, and to boot, when I woke up I was ridiculously high. Nothing I did seemed to bring me down. So I finally take a look at the label and see ""Consult a physician prior to use if you have a hormonal disorder, ***diabetes***, liver disease, etc.""

So after some Googling, I come across [this](http://www.diabetesselfmanagement.com/Articles/Diabetes-Definitions/melatonin/) article. 

""*People with Type 1 diabetes taking melatonin have experienced high blood glucose, and melatonin has also been shown to reduce glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.*""  Well that explains things.

Anyway, just wanted to spread the word so no one else has to deal with this. I also wanted to know if anyone has experienced this with either melatonin or any other type of medication.

1365461446.0	1by76x	Horrible pump experience this morning- the community stepped up!!	ajlb29	40	4	22	"This morning was THE WORST!!!! I had a cartridge failure last night after a site change, but didn't notice it until I woke up at 6am this morning!! I was in the mid-300's and felt awful. The G4 showed a steady rise from 8pm last night and peaking right before 400 around 2am. Anyways, knowing that if everything was a-ok I never would have gotten that high, I called Tandem and we discovered bubbles coming out of my cartridge. This is the second in the same box that I have had problems with and they are replacing the whole thing. I brought extra of everything, so at this point NBD. 

So anyways, this is where it gets frustrating. I go to the mini-fridge in the hotel room to get my BRAND NEW VIAL OF NOVOLOG. I open the door and notice that, 'wow, the fridge is a bit cold'. It was freezing. The baggy of carrots next to the vial was FROZEN. Fuck. Double fuck. I didn't bring extra insulin, just extra supplies. I call the front desk and tell them their 'fridge' has frozen my life-saving medication. Meanwhile, every single freaking pharmacy is closed until 9am. So here I am, sugars sky high, no insulin, thinking of having to replace a brand new vial at $164 or thereabout and so frustrated I'm sobbing that on the first day of this wonderful conference I am stuck having a diabetic moment. 

Fast forward to 11am, the hotel refuses to replace the vial, Rite Aid hasn't called back about transferring my prescription, I'm hungry, peeing and drinking like water is going out of style and out of me, frantically stacking my insulin to bring it down (thank god no crash happened later) and a complete stranger from a fb group tells me to call her. She has an emergency prescription of Humalog on file at CVS. I pop in a taxi and pick of the vial. New cartridge, NO BUBBLES, new insulin, and I am finally in a good range (ate breakfast/lunch at 123) and I can finally enjoy this conference. 

I tell you, I haven't been as frustrated with this disease since diagnosis three years ago. I sat and CRIED, angry that the one thing I should have control over, my body, doesn't do what it should. I am forced to rely upon technology that, no matter how cool or new, does not make up for what my body should be doing all on its own. However, the people make up for it. We support each other, T1, T2, T1.5, and every other type of diabetes. We all understand how awful not being in control of our bodies is.

I'm wondering if everyone has a similar story to mine, or if sometimes people just wake up in a hospital out of no where.

My story: woke up one morning, and decided to drink half a gallon of orange juice.  My stomach was not too happy, and my family and I were about to go on a long 3 month trip to the arctic circle the next day.  So we figured play it safe, see if I have something that might give me problems in Alaska, go to a doctor, and have it checked out.

Went to a clinic, had a blood test, then another, then another, then another, then asked what was going on, and they said my blood sugar is unusually high, and they are not sure if their machine is working properly.  Checked my self into the hospital an hour later.  Alaska was delayed a week.

I swim competitively, and had morning practice before school. This normally drops my blood sugar farther than normal during the day.To combat this, I carry a gatorade around with me. Unfortunately, my second period class is chemistry, and we can't have food or drinks in the lab for risk of contamination. Of course, the lock down is called while I am in chemistry, and no one can leave the room. Normally exceptions can be made for medical reasons, but since the drug dogs were in the school, I couldn't leave to grab my gatorade or visit the nurse because of liability issues (the dogs are easily provoked). The whole time I could feel myself dropping, but there was nothing I could do about it. When they finally released us, about 40 minutes after my lunch was supposed to start, I was ridiculously light headed and shaky.  I went straight to the nurse and tested my blood. I was at 31.

Last Friday I posted concerning about being a diabetic.

Thanks to you guys, I decided to go to the ER, and luckily I did.

I showed up just to see a nurse in triage, but ended up getting rushed onto a bed and staying there until today. They told me that if I didn't show up for another couple days it would have got exponentially worse resulting in an inevitable coma and eventually death, extremely scary stuff.

My glucose level was 34.2 when I arrived, and it took several days to get it down to the acceptable level (4-7).

I was diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes, and would have probably decided to brush it off until my scheduled doctor's appt. I owe it to you guys for the advice and potentially my life, thanks so much!

A common problem for me in my early days was buying Snickers' and keeping them in the fridge for when I had a hypo. I'd almost always eat them within a couple of days and when I had a hypo I'd have to have coffee or simply eat/drink sugar, which any diabetic will tell you is a very unpleasant experience.
Instead, simply buy something you don't particularly like, but which isn't unpleasant, with sugar, will save you the temptation. For me it's [dextrose tablets](http://www.chemistdirect.co.uk/dextro-energy-tablets-tropical_1_12154.html), they're extremely cheap, fast acting, and come in a few flavours. I don't particularly like the orange flavour ones, so I buy those and keep a packet in my jacket pocket, car, house and work. That way even if I lose my jacket, crash my car, or whatever else, I'll always have a fast acting remedy to low blood sugar wherever I am and I'm not otherwise tempted to gobble them up.



* **Seek out Novorapid or any fast acting insulin.**

Novorapid is a [fast acting insulin](http://www.diabetes.co.uk/insulin/rapid-acting-insulin.html), of which there are 4 main brands (there may be more or less depending on where/when you are, but there are still fast acting insulin brands) which means it acts very fast, typically within 10 minutes, of injecting and is **excellent** when you have high blood sugar. The problem is they don't usually tell the newly diagnosed about it because it's very expensive and potentially dangerous if you keep it next to your regular insulin, it can also be abused by those who want to eat high sugar foods without immediate blood sugar consequence. If you're sensible and look after your diabetes, none of these are an issue and fast acting insulin is a valuable tool and it's worth getting a new pen every few months for when you might need it.



* **Exercise will help you a thousand times more than any diet changes, techniques or products.**

The single biggest impact I've had on my blood sugar, attitude, and treatment of diabetes is regular exercise. Regular exercise has the benefits of drastically helping your immune system, circulation cardiovascular and stress levels, all of which are common problems and symptoms of poorly controlled diabetes.
This is a lifestyle change and takes a bit of work and effort to set up, but it's important because it's probably the biggest and most important change you'll make for a better and longer life with Diabetes.

There are some obvious precautions to take, like taking some dextrose tablets or sweets along with you, taking care of your feet as best you can, etc, but this really is just about finding a half hour to an hour 3 times per week and committing yourself to working out at those times every week.

Here is [The Couch Potato to 5k running program](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) which is all you need. Finding or creating your own cardiovascular workout program will bring you leaps and bounds, both literally and figuratively. I coupled The 5k Running program with [the one hundred pushups program](http://www.hundredpushups.com) to give me a bit of strength as well as endurance after being told by a doctor I had high blood pressure, most likely as a result of a sedentary lifestyle, resulting in stress and lethargy, both of which are now gone. 3 hours per week for me is more than enough to keep me happy and moving forward."	t5_2qhsj	True
1338928429.0	umnwn	let's talk about drugs, baby	purplehumpbackwhale	39	7	31	"let's talk about you and me. 

but seriously. due to the obvious risks involved with experiments, there isn't exactly much ""official"" information available about the effects of illicit drugs on diabetics. i think it is a good idea for people to share some of their experiences in a honest, judgment-free thread so that other young diabetics know what exactly can/will happen with various drugs BEFORE they take them.

let me start by saying, if you're here to say how horrible it is that i'm ""encouraging"" young diabetics to do drugs, honestly your words are futile here. you might as well teach abstinence to a group of 10th graders instead of teaching them about condoms. the bottom line is, kids are going to do the drugs. if they are mentally and physically perpared to handle their diabetes during that experience, then they will be much safer.


Now i'll start for real. 

**Weed** - this is a simple one and yet because of a lack of information i went through a tough time in my early years. most importantly, know that marijuana has **no effect on blood sugar levels directly**. its important to keep this in your head so you are not getting paranoid, etc. HOWEVER marijuana can sometimes simulate the symptoms of hypoglycemia (lightheadedness, dizziness). i have on many occasions freaked out and chugged juice and then tested my blood sugar and it was not low at all. but big deal! it was the safer choice. 
when i first started smoking, paranoia was truly the most crippling thing that coincided with diabetes. i was so paranoid about going low that it would ruin my high and often times make my friends have a bad time as well. nowadays, i smoke literally every day and even when i am significantly low, i remind myself that i'm safe and i will feel fine in 3 or 4 minutes.

- always check blood before smoking. its just good to know where you're starting at. 
- be weary of the munchies! obviously being high (sugar) is safer than being low. but often times in a blazed-stupor i lose complete track of how many chips i've really eaten, and before i know it, the mixture of being high and having high blood sugar turns me into a total nap zombie. 


enough about weed! just be smart - its not really much different than real life.^(its just a lot more fun.)



**ACID**

ok. i was diagnosed at 13 and by age 16 i became very curious about psychedelics. i would read articles and articles in encyclopedias/scientific journals/anecdotes/biographies about the effects of psychedelics. i found it to be profoundly interesting regarding the nature of consciousness. however, i was also very aware that as a diabetic i would likely have to wait until there was a cure before i could take shrooms or acid. **not because i thought they affected blood sugar** but because i knew that if i was *merely worried* about going low, it could cause a bad trip. knowing myself, and my paranoia i frequently experienced with weed at the time, i thought it was a recipe for disaster. *Fast Forward to college* after i became a regular Toker, and overcame my weed paranoia, and additionally had much more experience hanging out around people who were doing acid, i became slightly more open to the idea. last summer i went camping at a music festival with a kid who, it turns out, was also type 1 and had done acid and shrooms multiple times with no issues.

this finally gave me the confidence to try acid for the first time and i did so. Here are some things diabetics should know about acid

- it also does not directly affect blood sugar
- taking 1 tab of acid will usually NOT result in visual hallucinations. instead it will likely be closer to an 8-hour adrenaline rush and copious amount of enthusiasm for everything. i highly recommend 1 tab for a first time.
- your attitude towards the trip and the situation you place yourself in (you ""set and setting"") largely determines the results of your trip. I.E. **If you are nervous about tripping with diabetes, hold off!** . as i stated earlier, going into a trip feeling nervous about your own safety can result in a bad trip. (also keep in mind that a bad trip is really only likely in cases of 2-tabs or more)
- acid will not impair your understanding of your surroundings. for some reason i had this idea that i might not totally comprehend my glucometer or what my blood sugar meant. *this is ridiculous*. i was 100% able to check my blood sugar and respond accordingly. luckily, i don't think i even went low once, the entire 10-hour trip.

- make sure you have generous amounts of juice etc readily available. not because you have al likelihood of going low, but because it will add to your peace of mind.


these are the only two drugs i have done. i plan to do shrooms over the next month or so, but i wanted to get a couple experiences with acid under my belt first because i understand shrooms are freakier than acid and has a higher likelihood of a bad trip. 


please share your experiences with everyone!

EDIT - **Alcohol** because some people brought it up in responses (and rightly so). alcohol is by far the worst drug for diabetics save maybe your classic hard-ass drugs. **alcohol is sigificantly less safe than weed or psychedelics!** in the long-term, alcohol preocupies your liver, preventing it from producing glycogen (natural sugar). this turns into a nasty combination with passing out - if you pass out drunk you might not wake up when low OR WORSE, when you pass out low, your friends might just assume you were drunk and pay no mind."	t5_2qhsj	True

I found out I was pregnant last November and it was a surprise, to say the least. My a1c was hovering around an 8.5 and things were not well-controlled. 

I knew I wanted the baby, so I did a complete 180 with enormous support from my doctors, family, and husband. Within 1.5 months I had my a1c down to a 5.5. At the beginning, this took a butt load of testing. Sometimes up to 25 times a day (which probably wasn't necessary, but made me feel better and more in control). 

Even with an a1c of 5.5 (which I maintained for the remainder of the pregnancy), there were days with highs and lows. I remember having numbers in the 400's on two occasions. That was terrifying. Also some extreme lows. Hormones don't make this easy. Instead of worrying I would try to correct and move on. It's all I could do. 

With dedication to checking my blood sugars, meeting with my endocrinologist to regularly adjust my ever changing insulin needs, using an insulin pump, my pregnancy turned out to be actually fairly easy. 

The reward? A perfectly healthy baby boy who I am absolutely in love with. He was 6 lbs 3 ounces (so not large at all). His blood sugars needed to be checked for the first 12 hours of his life and were all normal. He was healthy in absolutely every way and we got to leave the hospital earlier than anyone anticipated because we were both doing so well. 

This is me saying, YOU CAN DO THIS IF YOU WANT TO! Diabetes does not limit your ability to gestate a perfectly healthy baby. Feel free to ask me any questions. I just wanted to share because I know before I got pregnant I was constantly anxious that I would never make it through a pregnancy.

And for fun: [My little dude.](http://i.imgur.com/FlQOzgl.jpg)

ETA: Obviously, it's ALWAYS going to be safer to plan for pregnancy if possible and have an a1c &lt; 6 well before conceiving, but obviously this doesn't always happen in real life, and I just wanted to share my story because of the fact that it was unexpected and not well-controlled to begin with.

It's not just a prototype; he claims that they will be starting trials within the next year or two.  It's a device that basically acts like a shark cage; it contains beta cells which allow insulin production in the bloodstream while being protected from the body.  The device assumedly has to be surgically placed into the body (around the hip or buttock), but hopefully will last for 18-24 months.

The subreddit was a little less active then I think so I figured I would submit again.  Feel free to fire any questions my way.  And if you saw this the first time around - down vote me to oblivion :)

----

At 25 I was diagnosed a Type 2 diabetic.  However, I was in my honeymoon period and 4 months later my meds and diet/exercise couldn't keep my sugars down and my primary made the Type 1 diagnoses and immediately set me up with an endocrinologist.  After my fist visit he asked if he could share my information with a group in Orlando (I lived about an hour away) with regard to a study they were working on and they quickly contacted me they are only looking for those who have been diagnosed within the past 90 days.

The study was called [DEFEND](http://www.wtvq.com/health/981-defend-diabetes-trial).

&gt; DEFEND is a Phase III clinical trial looking at a drug, called otelixizumab. Thomas Donner, M.D., Lead Investigator at the Joslin Diabetes Center/University of Maryland, says the drug is given through a half-hour intravenous infusion over 8 consecutive days. Otelixizumab is designed to target and attack the immune cells that are inappropriately killing the islet cells. Hopefully, that will preserve the body’s ability to make some of its own insulin and extend the honeymoon period after diagnosis.

I was required to sign a boat load of paperwork and do a series of blood work to ensure I had enough islet cells kicking around so the drug could hopefully prevent them from dying off.

Once it came time for dosing, they put me up in a pretty nice hotel suite (kitchen, office etc etc).  I work from home, so it was nice to have an office available.  It lasted 8 days, and the dosing took roughly 4 hours.  They put me on a very slow drip IV, sat me in a comfy chair and gave me privacy.  I was able to work from the site, otherwise they had a nice HDTV and video games or whatever to occupy your time.

They provided some meds to take each morning to throttle back my immune system a bit as well as to prevent the symptoms I might get from the drug (flu like I was told).  

Once the dosing completed I was free to go for the rest of the day.  

After the 8 day period I had to return monthly for blood work.  Every third (I think) blood work was a more involved one where I drank a special breakfast shake and they drew blood every 30 minutes over a 4 hour period.  Otherwise they would draw a few tubes and I could be on my way.

Throughout the trial I was also provided a PDA (a Palm Pilot with their software on it) and a meter with test strips.  I had to test at least 4 times a day and the meter transferred the numbers to the PDA which got sent nightly to the study (via a dock that had a cell phone connection).  They provided me all the strips and lancets I needed (huge perk!).

It has been 3 years since I finished the trial and I recently had to leave it (I moved and there aren't any locations nearby which can do the blood work).  There was a 1 in 3 chance I was going to get the placebo and they notified me upon my departure that I did indeed get the placebo.  The nurse I worked with and myself suspected I did.  I felt like a champ throughout the dosing period.

I believe I was paid roughly ~$2500 throughout the span of the trial.  And that doesn't factor in free test strips and lancets for 3 years.  

There has been some success with the trial, even a few who have gone completely off insulin, but I just received word that the study is getting extended for another few years.  

Needless to say it was interesting to participate and the perks of getting free strips and lancets was nice! (I have great insurance, so the savings were trivial but nice).

Living in the UK, I am frustrated at the sheer lack access to established and proven technology that both improves management, but provides an early warning system for undetected hypoglycemia.

The cost of a CGM in the UK, at startup can be between £1k and £2.5k ongoing costs per year can also run into the thousands, which places it beyond reach of a lot of T1 diabetics. Myself included. 
http://www.input.me.uk/cgms-how-much-does-it-cost/

My understanding of hypoglycemia is that When the body senses low blood sugar, it stimulates the release of epinephrine which causes an increase in heart rate. Which would be significantly higher than a resting heart rate. 

The cost of a bluetooth heart rate monitor is sometimes a little as a single cost of £35 and will synchronise with a number of applications for smartphones that allow alarms to be set should BPM (beats per minute) raise higher than a set range.

Usually, this technology is utilised for endurance exercise to find and exercise within target heart rates, however I feel that there is grounds to extend the use of this device to diabetics to provide us with a cheap effective early warning system to capture overnight hypoglycemia, where CGM's are not available.

I  own a heart rate monitor and will be testing this functionality by working out my resting baseline and also recording the increase in my heart rate during a controlled hypoglycemic episode. Using this information I will try and work out a working model with which to start using my bluetooth monitor during work and home to see if I can capture hypoglycemic episodes as they're happening with an alarm.

I've browsed many diabetic boards (such as this one) learning about the disease, and all of the T1's I've observed have been incredibly brave and optimistic about their disease.

1337883922.0	u34js	Introducing the June 2012 r/Diabetes Challenge (v2.0)- A Collective Effort Towards Better Diabetes Care!	Sippin_Haterade	36	4	34	"Hello everyone!

It's finally time for another r/Diabetes Challenge. This will be the second r/diabetes challenge held on the subreddit so far, and there will definitely be more in the future.

So what is the r/Diabetes Challenge? The r/Diabetes Challenge is a challenge for members of the subreddit to make a conscious effort geared towards better diabetes care. It's the same idea as a group of friends encouraging each other to lose some weight, or to stop smoking- applied to our subreddit and diabetes. **The r/diabetes Challenge is a collective effort for stronger diabetes management.**

I would just kindly ask all those who are participating to [**please fill out the anonymous survey**](http://redditdiabetes.polldaddy.com/s/r-diabetes-challenge-june-2012) so we can track results. All information is confidential, and anonymous. If you provide your username, your information will still be confidential and anonymous unless otherwise specified.

If you want to see the results of the last challenge, then check out [this link](http://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/ryla6/rdiabetes_challenge_the_results_are_in_traffic/).

----

**Goals for the Challenge**

* At least one person experiences an overall improvement in glucose levels.
* Participants as a whole experience better glucose control during this period.
* That participants continue any positive habits after the challenge.

----

**What's New This Challenge**

*Questions of the Day*

We will be posting questions that will hopefully spur discussions regarding diabetes management every few days. Some of the questions will be open ended, while others will be in the forms of polls. If you have any ideas for questions that you would be interested in seeing answered (either in a poll or as an open ended question) then please PM me or the other mods.

*""Challenge Buddies"" (optional)*

A few of you suggested that we pair people together so they can encourage and motivate each other throughout the challenge. This could help people stay focused and on course with developing new habits, motivated, and accountable for improving their health. This is, of course, optional, and there will be etiquette set in place for participants to follow (see details below).

----

**How the Challenge Will Work**

* First, promise yourself better diabetes management for *at least* the duration of the challenge.

* Participants will [fill out an anonymous survey](http://redditdiabetes.polldaddy.com/s/r-diabetes-challenge-june-2012) before and after the challenge. If you are a lurker, please feel free to participate too!

* If you are interested in being part of the buddy system then make sure you provide your username in the survey, and read more about Challenge Buddy etiquette below. We will try to pair buddies based on diabetes type and gender. **Providing your username is necessary in order to be part of the buddy system!**

* As of now, we will be collecting data and spreading word about the challenge. **The official start of the challenge will be on June 1st, 2012**, and the challenge will finish at the end of the month.

* Those that are participating in the challenge can issue themselves [purple flair](http://i.imgur.com/vqcg5.png) (look on the sidebar).

* At the end of the month, participants will fill out a second survey.

* I will post a breakdown of the data to show any changes in average glucose levels of the subreddit, to see how we did as a whole.

* If you feel stuck at any point, or are [experiencing burnout](http://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/search?q=burnout&amp;restrict_sr=on) then please make a post, message your Challenge Buddy, or join the [IRC chat room](http://bit.ly/wubCAs) (where there are many kind diabetics who are helpful, supportive, and free of judgement.)

----

**Challenge Buddy Etiquette**

*Do:*

* Provide a brief introduction of yourself- how long you've been diagnosed, goals for the challenge, etc. 

* Be kind, courteous, and patient with your buddy.

* Try to connect with your buddy every 3-5 days- preferably every 3, unless otherwise arranged. Try to work around each other's schedules and figure out when is best to catch up on each other's progress. The more often you message each other the more effective the buddy system will be.

* Try to be there for your buddy. This is a two way street. If your buddy is trying to help you out, please try to help back. 

*Don't:*

* Judge your buddy. This is a judge-free relationship.

* Ask for information that's not relevant to diabetes. Respect your buddy's wishes to stay as anonymous as possible (unless your buddy shares this information without you asking)

* Be rude, condescending, or impatient if your buddy doesn't stay motivated or on track with his/her goals. No one is forcing you to do this.

----

**Some Things To Consider**

These are a few minor changes in care that have great marginal benefit:

* Check your sugar at least 3-5 times a day.

* Check your sugar before eating meals.

* If on insulin, don't eat food without bolusing/injecting appropriately.

* Check your sugar at your peak after every meal or snack. That is probably about an hour after the last bite.

* Use that result, if it is higher than you like, to review what you ate and consider reducing the carbs in that menu for that meal next time for a better result.

* If on insulin or an insulin-stimulating med, make those changes cautiously; you don't want to go from hyper to hypo. A little at a time, then test and review again.

* Be diligent and proactive with your medication.

* Make more of a conscious effort to count carbs.

* Try not to beat yourself up and dwell on high readings or bad control, but rather think of ways to improve next time.

* Be open to include more exercise/healthy lifestyle choices during this time period.

* Try to get in at least half an hour of exercise or vigorous physical activity daily.

Omnipod users know that when you hear that high pitched ring, you're in for some stress. I have had countless numbers of Pod errors, occlusions, and most recently today, a PDM error. Today i have reached my last straw with Omnipod, because as a college student, i am currently attending class with a midterm tommorow, while trying to balance the fact that i now have no basal insulin, no pump, and now (because i also use my pdm for it), no way to check my blood glucose. And to top it off, our health care system here at this undisclosed school (which i'll give you the mascot of, which is the gators) is absolute shit. They don't carry any glucose monitors on site for purchase even. So here i am, facing so many issues besides not having an insulin pump, because of Omnipod. I am writing this to any potential pump users. DO NOT GO ON THE OMNIPOD. Not only do i lose pumps when there are errors (which they do refund because they know theyre shitty) but i lose insulin from not being able to take insulin out of the loaded pod. So Omnipod, I use your product, and i want fucking compensation. For pumps, for insulin, for gasoline, and now for the money this class that i'm about to fail costs. Fuck you Omnipod.	t5_2qhsj	True
1337398124.0	tu9od	I kicked my diabetes in the FACE!	sigmaration	38	4	21	"I was diagnosed with T2 in February of this year with an A1C of 11% and a BG in the 300s. I had lost 60 pounds quite suddenly, I was thirsty all the time, and was really low in energy. I have had PCOS for 20 years, and the doctor said that I did a great job keeping T2 at bay as long as I did, but it and my family history finally caught up with me.

I am a natural (some would say compulsive) problem solver, so I decided right then and there to really take this thing seriously and make some permanent changes. I bought a spin bike for my house and started working out. I started taking my Metformin, slowly increasing the dose. I cut down my carb intake dramatically, and cut out flour almost completely. 

3 months later, my A1C is 6.7%. My BG is consistently in the 120-130s. I've lost another 20 pounds (with some more to go). I ride my bike 35 minutes at a time, 3-4 times per week. I generally eat ~100g carbs per day and rarely feel deprived. I also quit smoking last week.

I have worked incredibly hard and made giant changes in my lifestyle in the last 3 months, and it's so exciting to see it paying off. I kicked this thing right in the face!

I definitely found a lot of support from my frustrated, ""I can take care of myself and am giving up,"" type post, and I found a few young type 1s that could identify with me, but not too many.  

Then I discovered reddit and decided to see if there was a diabetes subreddit.  I really makes me feel great to find all the type 1s on here who are all going through problems similar to mine.

Thank you. 		29	1	5	"When I was first diagnosed at age 21 (T1), I basically left my many meetings with the endo &amp; dieticians with the notion you check BG to help you understand and predict. Once you understand how your body responds to, say, 3 units after having a sandwich, you're good to go. And that's how I've lived over the past 14 years.

I checked *very* infrequently, usually only in order to correct when I actually *felt* that something was wrong. The end result; I'm pretty sure my average glucose levels have been around the 200-250 mark over the past year(s ?) or so. 

How do I know? 

Because I've started checking 7 times a day as part of the June challenge.  

I just want to say thank you to all the posters in r/diabetes for helping me dispell this idea. Diabetes is not something you first 'figure out', so that then you can coast along on a semi-structured lifestyle and estimated guesses how much to bolus. 

Just hearing you guys talk about your checking routines, the care you take, the strive for staying in the 100-120 range... I read about your perfectionism first with a sort of derision, then it scared me to death and now, hopefully, it's going to act as a motivator to help me continuously better my lifestyle.

Sigh...it feels like even the ADA doesn't give a shit about T1s.  There's nothing T1s could have done to 'stop diabetes' and even the ADA is perpetuating the stereotype further.  I really wish they would just call T1 something else at this point, I would have suggested they change the name of T2, but the word 'diabetes' is already too synonymous with poor personal habits and lifestyle.  I know, not everyone who has T2 got it from a sedentary lifestyle, but the majority did and that's how everyone sees us T1s as well.  

I was out with some people and this girl I'm into (who doesn't know I'm T1) the other day and somehow the conversation got steered toward diabetes.  Someone was eating some kind of gummi worm or something, and said ""this is how you get diabetes.""  I said, ""well there's 2 types of diabetes."" and left it at that, since I really didn't want to get into it, or out myself in front of the girl, but then she says ""oh, yeah, diabetes is gross.  Paula Deen is gonna die from it.""  I chose not to say anything and left shortly thereafter, more than a little upset.

I just feel the need to vent, I don't know anybody in my life who has diabetes and I just want to express it to people who understand what it is like.


Today I went to my endo for my usual check up and to get my A1c. Turns out my usual endo wasn't there and there was another endocrinologist instead. I had an appointment at 9:00, I went in at 10:00 (sigh). This man was an absolute fool, I went to speak about Levemir just not working for me, I tell him my basal units (18u in the morning and 22u at night) all ok, then he asks me how much do I bolus for lunch, I told him there isn't a specific unit I have as it depends on how many carbs I am eating in that meal.


He looked at me as if I were insane.


I explained to him I have 1u of bolus per 5g of carbs (I know, it's a lot, but it's what keeps it within goal range). Once again he looked at me as if I were insane, said that what I am doing is illogical and what I am doing makes no sense and where is the science in it. Almost fell on the floor. He told me I need to bolus per ration, if I were to have 1 slice of pizza I would need to have 5-6 units of bolus. I explained to him that the pizza slice may vary, it can come from a rozen pack, it can come from pizza hut, it can come from wherever and they will all most likely have a very different carb content and the system he is suggesting will not work. He then claimed 1 cup of yogurt I should bolus 2 units...once again I asked which kind of yogurt? Activia has 13g of carbs, greek yogurt has 4g etc. He didn't seem to catch on at all about anything I was sayying and refused to listen to me at all. I asked to be switched to Lantus, he agreed but said I need to raise my Levemir even MORE. I explained to him I have duplicated it, even once trippled it and fasted the whole day and not once did I get within goal range with Lemevir, it just kept going up and up. Then he suggested ""well if you for example ate a sandwhich"" I already explained to him I stay under 20g of carbs a day, my blood sugar does not raise because I didn't bolus correctly, it slowly creeps up when Levemir decides to hate me and I correct. He asked me how would I eat the sandwhich and bolus for it then, I explained I would look at the carb content of the package the sliced sandwhich bread comes in or any other ingredient and calculate my bolus. He insulted me and called me crazy. The nurses had no idea what I was on about either and said it's all done by portions and he is a very respectable endocrinologist. That this is not the way to do it and I need to speak to one of the nurses about my insulin dosages and meals...to strictly listen to what the endocrinologist says (lol no).


He didn't check my eyes, he didn't check my feet, he wasn't even going to check my A1c levels until I asked for it. He only weighed me.
Every single thing I said he dismissed it, treating me as if I had no idea about an illness I have had for 13 years, very horribly condescending. I walked out in complete tears from how horribly ridiculous he was. What frightens me though is that he is going around treating diabetics this way and possibly putting their health at risk.


Am I exagerating? Am I being a bit arrogant over this and may he be right about some of it?
I just can't believe an endocrinologist would do this so I keep questioning if maybe I am wrong...even though I surely think I am not."	t5_2qhsj	True

Hello! Let me introduce myself a little.  My name is Nelson.  I’m a filmmaker, a student at the University of Cincinnati, and a type 1 diabetic.

I became a diabetic at the age of 16 and it was devastating to me.  I immediately came to the conclusion that I was never going to be able to do much of anything from that day forward. That was until my brother gave me a piece of scrap paper with a few names jotted on it.

On that scrap of paper he had listed the names of several successful, famous and well-off type 1 diabetics.  It really caught me off guard.  That piece of paper gave me hope.  It gave me optimism for my future. I really could do something despite having diabetes.

6 years later and I’m a healthy, normal kid (at heart).  As I mentioned earlier, I’m a filmmaker studying at the University of Cincinnati and I’m currently embarking on my biggest endeavor yet!  I’m creating my first feature length documentary focusing on type 1 diabetics (sorry type 2’s!).  I want to show those with type 1 diabetes that having this disease wont hold you back from living a full and wonderful life.

So, this is where you come in r/diabetes!  I’m looking for individuals with type 1 diabetics that are doing amazing things with their lives to be interviewees for my documentary. 

No matter where you are from, leave some comments below or PM me and tell your story!  I’d love to hear all about what incredible things you are doing as a type 1 diabetic.  I’d love to showcase you in my documentary!

TL;DR I’m looking for individuals with type 1 diabetes to be featured in my first full length documentary!


Thank you everyone! Can’t wait to hear your story!

1373472093.0	1i0ixz	[Story Time] Passed out from a Hypo during a music festival.	oh_bother	29	3	39	"Alright, let's get into this. I am going to try to recount exactly what happened, the circumstances, and all the details I can remember before they all leak out of my ears. Wall of text style. 

Over this past weekend I was at a music festival in Maryland and had quite a scary hypo event. Full on pass-out, with a slow, excruciating, frustrating wake up period. Let's not get ahead of ourselves though, the festival involves a few thousand people at a campground, partying all night, revelry, the usual sort.  Generally I am on staff in this event, this would be my first year as a ""citizen"" so to speak, I was looking forward to kicking back. 

The first day was all camp setup, I wasn't the first to arrive at our little corner of the world so I really just set up my own gear, tent, supplies etc, and hung out with everybody as they trickled in. The weather was brutal: 90 - 100 degrees, very little wind, maximum humidity. This poses a unique problem for me as I tend to easily sweat off all of my gear. I was in the habit of periodically pressing on my pump site and CGM transmitter to make sure they were there, and to potentially re-stick if either had been threatening to peel off. 

I usually put a sheet of Opsite Flexfix over the CGM site, with a hole cut for the transmitter. I cry like a little girl when it's ripped off but it sticks that sucker on really nicely. There was no hope for any of my gear though; I lost both sites after a quick dunk in the pool (they were half off from the heat pre-pool, the next day I'd actually jump into the pool to cool off and rescue the sites from sweat).

I returned to camp, replaced all of my stuff and started the CGM calibration cycle. Ate a decent dinner and bolused a lot for the various snacks and things that were floating around camp. Overall I ate something like two ears of corn, a few carby snacks, and overbolused for it all. This typically isn't a huge deal, I have a massive insulin resistance, so even with a large bolus like that, the corn alone would be enough to lessen the blow of the insulin. Or so I had thought. 

Immediately after calibration I was super hyperglycemic, which isn't that huge of a deal considering the bolus (I've given twice as much insulin to recover from levels in that range). ""Oh well lets just keep going and see if I float around this high or if the usual frustratingly slow onset of insulin takes care of it..."". The CGM registered two points before my memory blanks out. 

Oh, before I forget, I had been light-drinking. This is a pretty important detail, and I am not sugar coating or anything I was really not drinking much since I loathe day drinking and I knew it wouldn't help me  hydrate in that heat. 

The next thing I recall is more of a sequence, I know now exactly what was occurring, and why, and when. If I wanted to spend more time writing this I could frame it as I saw things happening and try to convey the confusion but I am writing quickly so let's just jump into what was going on. 

The sun had set, the camp was bustling getting ready to go out for the night to check out the various partying going on around the festival. I popped back to my tent to gather my headlamp and figure out what I was taking with me (in the aftermath I would discover my head lamp sitting at the back of my tent with my glasses, not sure if they were flung there or what). According to the calibration I was super duper hyperglcemic, but not 10 mins after that my blood sugar crashed harder and faster than I had ever seen in my entire 20 years as a diabetic. Straight down. In the course of 40ish minutes I went from extremely high (400) to extremely low (LOW). I didn't make it three steps from the tent, I must have keeled over onto the grass just outside of it. 

My tent was off the beaten path very slightly, obscured by a tree (shade is vital for sleep). Everyone figured I had gone to bed or wandered off. I passed out in the only spot where it was possible to remain hidden. Nice work, me. Meanwhile my liver (lazy git) was busy processing the alcohol, and couldn't be arsed to lift a dainty finger in aid of my sugar situation. This is where things got weird. Several hours in the ""LOW"" range of the CGM pass, and about 4am I start to come to. 

At first, as my brain started to get some fuel, I was able to make out some sound (tech house I think). I am not sure when my eyes started to get their shit in gear but it was dark out, (so I thought) so it didn't really even matter. I knew I was lying in grass, and thought I was dreaming of being in a huge dark misty field. I had no idea I was at a festival. Some weird dreams go on, I think something about riding an art car or standing on one... Then there was one tree, in the middle of this flat empty grassy misty field...  so here I was in this dream (that wasn't a dream) unable to really do anything but move my head a bit, completely confused. The gravity of the situation started to sink in. I didn't make the connection to sugar at first but I started to see some lights and some shapes, people walking by (we were near a main path). I thought if I could get the attention of those people I could get help. The problem was that I didn't have enough sugar to properly move my muscles, hell my brain wasn't even back yet. I slurred kind of a ""hurp"" (help) to the road, but I knew I had to get there first. ""Oh yeah, my body lets work on that"" I could move my arm, a bit. I still had no clue where I was, but shapes and lights were starting to become more clear. At some point my brain caught up with everything and I realized I was hypo and needed sugar, fun times. I imagined how easy it would be to sit up cross-legged, I'd be higher up and could see somebody to flag down. I just had to shift my weight onto my butt and my legs would fold under and... lurched just a bit, feebly. Still on the ground. Shit. My head was just a bit more mobile at this point, I was able to look sort of behind me (across my body) and I managed to make out dark shapes (camp mates behind me). ""They'll be no help they are completely unlit, I need to get help from the brighter people"".... Still I tried to just, you know, get the word out there for anybody around me. It was like dragging hands across a keyboard in order to spell out ""help, diabetic"". One of the shapes heard me though!.. The unlit one D: 

This was probably the most beautiful silhouette I've ever seen, and it asked me if I needed help! I was still locked in this immovable fuel-starved machine but my head was starting to become spry and witty once again. The camp mate saw I may have sustained a head injury and told me she was going to get help. Just a few feet away a good friend was getting in after a raucous night, he was actually working and had a radio, they got medical to swoop in with a golf cart and whisk me away to the nurse station. 

As I said before, I used to work at this festival, and know all of the medical staff personally. The first thing I was asked was ""do. you. need. sugar."" to which I replied ""afeiafeiahfoeaifoee"" and nodded a lot. I don't think they could comprehend that I completely understood them, they could have given me a logic puzzle and I would have solved it, I just couldn't pilot ME to respond. I said CGM a lot hoping they'd look at the damn thing, but the staff nurse said she had no idea what a CGN was. 

The rest of the story is pretty boring, I came to and was completely fine. Well, at one point I tried to show them moving my arm from one spot to the other was impossible cause it overshot the goal... I smacked the wall a few times to my own amusement. I was a complete mess on the way in but was totally composed in an hour... minus the sweat stains, and the dirt on my face from when I keeled over. 

I owe that medical staff everything, they are spot on and are the greatest people in the world. 

I also plan on taking the girl who found me out to dinner. Also because she is cute.

Is there a lesson? This isn't a morality tale (far from it) shit happens. I'm going to pay closer attention to my CGM, I'm not even sure I could have prevented this though. It was so sudden, and so unexpected, huge bolus at 3pm... nearly 400 at 7pm to... I don't even know -20? In a span of 40 mins (i'll fact check that when I pull the logs). I've never in my life dropped that fast and I am very sensitive to lows.

I'm in my 20s and try to be pretty active on the dating scene. With that in mind, I'm pretty conscious about my pump site and my CGMS site on my sides.  It usually always comes up when things get physical with a girl and I typically do not disclose my condition until I absolutely have to do so.

Well, the other night I went on a tremendous date with (what I thought) was a great girl.  Things were going really well, and we ended up back at my place.  One thing led to another and we move it to the bedroom.  All good so far.  I'm a 'lights on' kinda guy, and she was (seemingly) very into it until I took my shirt off and revealed the pump site/tubing and the Dexcom's big ass sensor and site dressing covering a sizable amount of my left abdomen.  She asked what it was, a natural response, and I tried to tell her very quickly and act extremely nonchalant in explaining it and diabetes.  After that, her mood turned and she was all of a sudden very UN-interested in furthering things.  We ended up just going to sleep without anything happening and now she won't return my calls/texts and told me this morning that she ""just isn't wanting to date anyone right now"" which obviously isn't true because she wouldn't have gone out with me in the first place had that been the case.  

Anyways, I just I'm just ranting, and maybe I'm being paranoid, but it seemed like a done deal until she learned about my condition.  It instantly switched when she saw it.  Needless to say I'm pretty hurt by it, and I know ""anyone who doesn't love you for who you are...blah, blah"" is VERY true, but that still doesn't make it feel any better.

I work full-time and carry responsibility well, but all my friends are also still in that mentality.  Essentially, my relationships with all of my friends revolves around drinking.  In my more formidable years, I was able to drink 4-5 nights a week and be fine, but I've reduced it to 1 night a week at most right now, but that is still proving to be too much for me.  I'm getting some moderate amounts of neuropathy in my hands/arms as well as my legs, and I've heard that any alcohol consumption can increase that.  Also, I am about to go on Lyrica or Cymbalta for nerve relief.  I've taken Cymbalta before and it pretty much made it impossible for me to drink as I would become violently ill after a couple rounds, which drove me to stop taking it the first time around.  I heard that lyrica is the same in that regards.  My a1C was 5.8 last time, so I've been taking care of myself, but I feel as though this is a natural progression from here on out.

The past week or so, I've gone out with my friends (to a bar of course) and I was just drinking water the past two times.  It's kinda miserable, especially with all the pressure (not intentional or by design) that is put on me to drink and have a good time with them.  They don't really get it, and I don't expect them to do so, but going out to a bar and sitting there isn't as fun as it sounds, especially when everyone I know is having fun with it all.

I'm getting to a point where I feel it is in my best interest to NOT go out with them to combat the temptation to drink at all, but if I stop going out to bars with them, I know I will certainty lose their friendship.  Not from all of them intentionally kicking me out, but a natural course since I don't participate in the activities that 100% of my friends engage in every weekend.  They are my only friends, so it's a big concern of mine, but I really want to concentrate on my physical health, but this will negatively affect my quality of life I know.  

Another reason I want to stop socially drinking is the past 3 times I've drank, I've had extreme lows the next morning (low 30s-40s) even after I eat before going to sleep.  It's really scaring me since I don't want to pass out since I live alone.  I don't want to grow apart from my friends, but the center of our relationship is drinking.  I can't seem to find the balance between good physical health and social/mental health.  Every time I concentrate fully on health, I don't have any friends, and every time I have friends my physical health takes a nosedive.  I'm getting older, so I can't get away with as much as I used to in my younger days.  Has anyone else had issues like this?  It's pretty upsetting..."	t5_2qhsj	True

Despite the fact that I've had T1 for 11 years, there is still a family member who calls me *every single time* before I go to their house to ask what I can eat. I've responded the same way for 11 years as well: ""Anything is fine!"" ""Please don't go out of your way!"" ""I'll have what everyone else is having!"" And so on. And, like clockwork, this family member will make my diabetes the center of attention at the meal the next day as well. They'll ask in front of everyone what my sugar was, if I gave myself insulin, discuss past hospital stays, etc. I've asked them many times to please not make it a point of discussion, that it's really not a big deal, but they don't get it. I'm at the point now where I don't ever want to go there, but tomorrow I have an obligation to for another family, and have already received ""the phone call"" this afternoon.

1375737346.0	1jrlti	Do you get moody when high?	lemonfluff	31	7	45	"I went camping this weekend with friends, and I was in a great mood until I suddenly started feeling really sleepy. So I checked my sugars and they were 20 (360). For no reason. So I corrected and checked again an hour later because I was starting to feel majorly sick. Still 20. 

My sugars were on and off spiking high all weekend, rising by themselves and making me feel insanely ill. I didn't really have keytones (0.3 on the machine) and I had a rather bad hypo at one point too. I'm ill now so I'm fairly sure that's what caused it but basically I was in a terrible mood all weekend. People kept telling me to ""smile"" and shit and I felt so much like just hitting them because it was taking all my energy just to keep standing and look normal. 

This happens a lot when I go high. I get really angry and resentful easily, I normally want to hit something because of all the adrenaline and I feel really sick. I normally stop talking to people completely because it's too much effort and because I'll probably snap at them, but I just wanted to know if anyone else gets this? 

It drives me insane because I get so moody and can't help it. The insulin takes forever to kick in and I find a lot of the time I correct, wait a few hours and test again to be just as high as before. I know diabetics who can have highs and lows and barely feel it but I get restless, can't concentrate, sleep, do sport *anything* when high other than wait and hope it'll drop. And then I'm normally exhausted afterwards. 

It's also frustrating because to everyone else I just appear a big pissed off and even if I tell them ""My sugar's high"" they just assume I'm in a shit mood, but I'm really trying to be sociable and join in or at least *look* like I'm having fun, I just feel awful and my emotions are through the roof. And the fact that I don't ever get any appreciation from anyone else about how hard it is makes it suck that much more, because sometimes a pat on the back would be nice. 

I know I'm complaining but I'm in a pity-party kinda mood atm and I'm ill so I'm going to just go ahead and complain. "	t5_2qhsj	True

I should clarify that if I am a specialist in any clinical area it is economic analysis of clinician behaviour in the UK health service, *not* diabetes medication in the (presumably mostly) US, but the principles of pricing drugs are more or less the same across disciplines and I know enough about the US system to comment intelligently.

I've been denied medical assistance more times than I care to remember. I was 10 when I was diagnosed and it instantly ruined my life. The lack of proper treatment, from myself and doctors, has created a lot of problems. Yes the doctors I saw were sub-par at best. The proof of this is that it took over a month for me to be diagnosed when I was having really obvious symptoms. My blood sugar was 800+ and I'm lucky to have survived. Well maybe lucky isn't the right word. 

I already have complications (ketoacidosis, neuropathy, scarring, and stunted growth) and without insurance things are becoming bleaker. Without the free clinic I go to, I would really be up the river without a paddle. The truly bad complications have worried me for a while and now I can't stop thinking about them. I'm not worried about dying. I'm worried about living with a crippled body.

I have been on an insulin pump for 10 of those years. My main site of application has been my stomach area. I used to use my thigh but got way too many crimped canulas to make it worth it.

For I don't know how long, on the left side of my stomach, I have (what it seems to be for me since I don't know what to call it) a lack of stomach fat. It sounds good when I write it like that but it's just that the left side of my stomach is not symmetric with my right which has (to me) a noticeably higher amount of fat. It's not so apparent to people but I can really tell that there isn't fat where there should be. This spot also happens to be right where my main infusion set location would be. 

Just for information sake, I am not overweight, I am 5'11'' and weigh about 185.

I recall asking my doctor about it maybe 3 years ago but I think he just shrugged it off and told me to move my infusion set location. I am just wondering if anyone else here might have what I am trying to describe. 

Another question I had for this community was regarding scars from insulin pump infusion sites. Does anyone here have them? On my stomach alone I probably have a hundred or so. Any easy way to avoid them or make them less noticeable?

Don't worry, I'll try and keep it short.

I'm T1 who does contract work from home, so not a whole lot of in-person interaction.  Most Mondays though, I have to go into the central office, and most Monday's, I go for a walk when I get home.  Well, I went for a walk when I got home and took a nap after because I was tired. 

I woke up an hour later feeling kinda low, so I went and checked, and I was at 39 mg/dL.  My lowest recorded bg reading ever.  All I had to eat (that has any carbs in it) in the whole house was 2 pieces of wheat bread (Monday night is also grocery night), so I scarfed them down as fast as I could.  On my way back to the couch, I fell over and couldn't move off the floor.  I was just sitting there, my mind was fine (albeit racing), but I couldn't move any of my limbs or anything.  Sweat was everywhere, and I couldn't even keep my eyes open.  I was just sitting there thinking ""well...this is it.""  I live alone, and don't have any friends in real life, so if I lost consciousnesses, I knew I was dead.  My mind was fine, and all I could think about was how meaningless my death would be, and how easily preventable it should have been.  At that point it didn't matter, it was out of my hands.

As much as I want to believe that what they peddle is completely true, I can't help but be angry that they are making a huge amount of money by providing fasle hope to T1 diabetics.

It's actually a massive shame they have to go the full route of claiming to cure diabetes. The diet does actually have some grounding in truth, a low carb diet does indeed make T1 management much easier. 

Does it cure diabetes?, no. Is it fair that they can make these claims?, no.

I'm very happy to see such a positive response with the survey and [the r/Diabetes Challenge](http://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/p5i7y/introducing_the_rdiabetes_challenge_a_collective/) that will be taking place the next 3 weeks. So far we have 112 participants from a total of 14 different countries! It's always awesome to see people from various parts of the world who have never met uniting for a cause, specifically for better diabetes management! I look forward to collecting the data at the end of the challenge to see if this has been a successful run.

I am making this post as a simple reminder that **tomorrow, February 8th, is the official start of the challenge, so bring your A game!**. I know some of you have started a little early and that's totally fine- we needed to have a week window for more people to read about the challenge. Remember, by filling out the survey and saying yes to participating in the challenge, **we have all promised ourselves to make a conscious effort towards better control of our diabetes**. I hope everyone tries their best to fulfill this promise, especially since I believe that any difficulties faced during the challenge will be small compared to the awesomeness of experiencing better glucose levels.

Best wishes to all, and feel free to make a post or [visit the IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23reddit-diabetes) if you need support.

1372425895.0	1h8vir	16, T1 for 9 years, shocking control recently, sick and tired all the time. Want to make a change.	sghbghen	24	0	19	"Just feel like ranting a bit to people who can understand and who might be able to help.

I was diagnosed with Type 1 when I was 7. After being diagnosed I wasn't sad or angry or anything. All I remember was that I had been feeling bad for a long time and now in hospital getting injections I was feeling a million dollars.

In the next few years I kept good control over it. Multiple injections a day, testing BG often, you know the drill. I eventually got a pump, maybe 4 years after diagnosis. Animas IR1200 (since upgraded to the IR1250 and now 2020). Diabetes control got tighter.

Problems started about 3-4 years ago. Started getting seriously sick of having to deal with it. Stopped using a record book. Got lazy with carb-counting. It was easy to do this with a pump, it almost takes care of itself. ""Oh just ate something, better have some insulin... yeah a couple units maybe. When did I last test? I dunno... whatever.""

I figured out if I ever wanted a day of school I could purposely make my BG high in the morning by disconnecting my pump in the evening. I did this far too often. I lied to my doctors every checkup, told them I didn't know why my BG was spiking some mornings. Eventually things got so bad I went on a CGM device for a week so they could pinpoint what was going wrong. The docs reevaluated my basal and bolus rates, and I made more of an effort to keep stuff under control from then on... for a while.

**Where I'm at today:** Frankly, I feel like shit. And have been feeling like shit for a long time. As I'm writing this it's about 1am Saturday morning. My BG is &gt;16mmol/L (&gt;288mg/dl). It was higher two hours ago, it's barely dropped. I wasn't at school yesterday, second day off this week. My control at the moment is shocking. My docs would probably be in shock if I was actually honest with how I've been handling it. My basal rates are outdated. My insulin-carb ratio and insulin sensitivity factor are even more out of date, I just go by semi-educated guesses of how much I think I should take. Somehow my HbA1c's aren't shocking, they suggest that it's mostly under control. I would assume that's because of some extreme lows cancelling out the highs so overall it looks right, but in reality everything is yoyoing all the time.

I feel tired all the time, even if my BG's fine. I'm sick approximately 50% of the time - I've had bad luck recently with colds/flu, whether that's a cause or a result of my poor control I don't know. I don't remember the last time I felt 100%. I still try to exercise when my BG's are ok and that helps a bit.

**What I want:** I know how bad my control has been lately, and I want to change that. I want to be healthy. I've felt like shit for so long, I want a change. But:

* There's no motivation if I feel like shit, and I feel like shit most of the time
* All my good diabetes control habits I once had I have lost
* My basal/bolus rates are so out of date, I don't know what to do to change them without fronting up to my docs, and
* I sure as hell don't want to front up to my docs about how terrible my control has been. That would mean fronting up to my family as well, and
* I can't front up to my family about years of lying. That's just not going to happen

I don't even know why I'm posting here or what I want to get out of it. Just wanted to say this somewhere and I have nowhere else for that. If anybody has advice or help that would be great too. I don't know.

I hope everybody is having a wonderful day today."	t5_2qhsj	True

So I'm in DC today, enjoying a great day out. I had to leave at the buttcrack of dawn to get here, and I had to change my pump while waiting at the gate for my flight. No biggie. I tested, 101. Gangster. 

I get to Baltimore, then to the Greenbelt, then to my hotel, drop all my stuff (including pump supplies because, hey, I'd just changed it) and set off to explore some museums. It's hot today, and I noticed a spot of liquid on my shirt. I thought it was either sweat or water leaking from a water bottle in my purse, no big deal. 

Pick up a coffee, dose for the cream, carry on..see a museum, stop to test...255! Hmm, ok, well, maybe that sweetener stuff wasn't diabetic approved, no biggie, I'll dose.

Arrive at next museum, see food trucks. Decide I've been walking a ton and I'm not going to stop, so I'll treat myself to some dumplings. Sit down to test...361! Oh shit. Look at pump, seems fine. I dose for the carbs and the high BG, and then I notice this little drop of liquid on my shirt. Meanwhile I'm chowing down on these dumplings and kimchi.

Being a shameless bastard, I pull my shirt up to look at my site, and my hand grazes just below and...it's wet. Uhoh. I tentatively sniff my hand..and it's that tell tale smell. Insulin. Shit's been leaking since 5am and it's now well after noon. Hauled ass to the metro, meanwhile I can FEEL my blood sugar rising. I resist losing said dumplings on the Green line, fumble my way in to my hotel and test again...457. Uhhhggghghghg. 
Got that shit changed, dosed dosed dosed like a boss. Sitting in the metro station again and my blood sugar was 570! OH GOD. I'm going to explode.

Took me 5 hours, around 35 units of insulin, and who knows how many gallons of water and about four miles walking to get that shit down. 135 just before dinner, 85 just now.

I didn't think it would go over well in the thread.

I was in Gym Class at age 6-7 and the gym teacher started to teach us about diabetes. She gave us all rubber bands and told us to put them on our wrists and told us ""this is what happens when you have diabetes!""

""When you have to check your blood sugar, you have to pull the band all the way back and snap your wrist with it!""

""Breakfast! Check your sugar!"" SNAP

""Lunch! Check your sugar!"" SNAP

""Snack! Check your sugar!"" SNAP

""Today is your friends birthday and you want a piece of cake!"" SNAP

""Dinner!"" SNAP

and so on. 

She ended it by saying ""If you don't want to deal with this when you're older, don't be fat!""

And then I got diagnosed at 18 and realized that everything I learned was total garbage and that testing your blood sugar, in no way, hurts as much as snapping your wrist with a rubber band.

Just wanted to tell this story, do you have any stories of failed diabetes education?

That all went well and we went over what should happen if he's high and needs more insulin, to which his teacher makes comment that 'We like it when he's high because he's nice and quiet, and doesn't disrupt the class a lot', probably in reference to how he starts to bounce off the walls once he's had a correction as he can now convert it all to usable energy and seems to do so in a very short period of time.

1328188598.0	p7n1z	One year ago...	hmasing	24	2	10	"...I found out I am a Type 2.  I was having headaches and body aches all the time, my joints hurt, and I was irritable as hell.  My fasting glucose was 330mg/dl.  My A1C was 10.3%.  At the same time, my cholesterol was out of control.

Today I had my one-year checkup.

My average blood glucose for the past six months (including after meals, when I feel high, when I let myself have cake) is 104mg/dl.   (Although for the past two weeks, my average is 121mg/dl - mostly due to me chugging a couple large glasses of what I was *assured* was 'diet coke', and then when I tested it with a diastix was pure sugar... That resulted in a few hours of 300mg/dl and major headaches and shakes, so I tested hourly until I came down).

My A1C is 6.0%

And my cholesterol is 'perfect' according to my doctor.

I lost about 20 pounds in the first two months.  (I could stand to lose another 50).

This was done primarily through lifestyle changes and major changes to diet.  I have eaten more bacon in the last year than I have in the past decade, and I have eaten eggs almost every day.  My eating out dinner is a large steak with blue cheese and a side salad with oil/vinegar.  I allow myself breyers all-natural vanilla ice cream from time to time, because I'm not dead, and with 15g of carbs in a serving I can handle it.  I do allow myself one 'go slightly crazy' day a week where I'll suck up the high and allow bread with dinner or if I am feeling REALLY saucy some sushi.

Meds are minimal - 2.5mg of glyburide and 500mg of metformin, as well as whatever the minimal dose of simvastatin is to help with my cholesterol ratios.  

A lot of my success has been with the support of this subreddit.

I think that with the diabetic challenge going on this month, about the only thing that would be a major lifestyle change would be exercise.  I'm thinking of doing the [/r/c25k](/r/c25k) plan.

I've been a type one diabetic for nearly six years now, and we've never had problems with insurance or my doctor in terms of getting my insulin prescription (humalog). Usually the insulin comes in the mail and I'm set to go.
Yesterday, however, as I drained the last of my humalog to put into my pump, I realized that we have no extra bottles of insulin in the fridge. I asked my mother what was going on, and she said there's some confusion with the prescription and my doctors aren't communicating with the insurance and they won't renew it. 
So. I'm down to forty units now. If I starve myself, I might be able to make it last until tomorrow afternoon. I'm really upset that I'm being deprived of a prescription that my well being depends on. My mother is doing everything she can and has been calling these people for days, but we still haven't gotten an email from them.
Has this happened to anybody else before? What did you do and how was the situation resolved? 

EDIT/UPDATE: Okay, I got insulin! We managed to get an emergency prescription from Walgreens for a whopping total of $134.95. Our health insurance will not reimburse it. &gt;:C
Now, however, UCSF is withholding my prescription renewal until I come in for an appointment. I find that annoying because they're always running at least an hour behind schedule and it takes pretty much the entire day to go to an appointment there.

Some days, (same scenario), I'll get back and be in the 50 mg/dL even.

It's so demoralizing that I work really hard, eat smart, and my blood still runs high.  I just don't know what to do anymore.  I'm so infuriated with myself for not being able to get a grip on it and be regular.  Every day is completely different blood sugars for no reason whatsoever.  Some days 1u for 15 works, then the next 1u for 7g works, and I never know until I get a huge spike later in the day and feel like shit and can't do shit but sleep or lounge around because of it.  I eat really healthy and exercise at least 6 if not 7 days a week, and my insulin levels are NEVER standardized even though everything else in my life is.  My endo. is completely useless (outside of writing prescriptions), and my dietitian/practitioner can't really make any honest suggestions in intake/sensitivity factor/i:c ratio because it never matches any pattern.   I'm so fucking sick of it.

I just got out of a 15 days stay at the hospital where I found out I have type 2 diabetes, I am 18. I don't think I realized right away what was going on, I've been over-weight for a long time but never overly ( 76 kg  for 171 cm ) and nobody ever made fun of me or something like that so I kind of forgot that I was unhealthy. I was a little numb in the hospital but now that I've got out and started talking to people and telling them about the illness, and the first question that always comes out is : is it a type 1 or 2. It is hard for me to say 2 because from then on I can picture the thoughts in their head like yeah she should have take care of herself, no wonder she's got that look how fat she is. 10 minutes ago I had the stupid idea to see the diabetic tag on tumblr and a lot ( well some ) of the posts are type 1 hating on type 2 because they don't like the comparison. It really hurted me, now I am part of statistics of the growing percentage of young people getting a type 2. I became totally paranoid like it's written fat cow on my forehead all the time now, that with having to take the medicine + insulin + eye doctor, foot doctor, I am really struggling.

EDIT : I don't If you will see this but I'd just really want to thank you. I'm not saying everything is okay now and I don't blame myself anymore but I feel so much better wich allow me to focus more on my health so thank you. Oh and I will probably PM the two people in this thread who are young like me and have T2 !

[Original Post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/13y7tg/t2my_a1c_is_at_81eac_186_need_to_reduce_to_below/) In that time I have been doing a **[3/3/3 keto diet] (http://www.ncl.ac.uk/magres/assets/documents/StudyRecipes.pdf)** 3 Glucose Control Shakes (I used Nestles Boost Glucose Control because I could not find the one listed) / 3+ Liters of water / 3 servings of vegetables.   I also have added a diabetic multivitamin once a day, a coconut oil supplement and an amino acid supplement twice a day.  My Doc also has me on 500mg Metformin twice a day.

* I have gone from 261lbs to 225lbs (36lbs of weight loss)
* My Blood Sugar has gone down from 365avg to 119avg.
* My A1C from 8.1 to 6.6

All in all I feel much better; I have more energy and am less tired in the afternoons.  I am sticking with the diet for now as at this point real food makes me too full.  I do “cheat” now and again by having some lean meat for dinner and or a low carb snack.  My boss is very impressed with my dedication to this diet and reducing my A1C.  It looks like I’ll get to deploy in the next few months!

**TL:DR** Not Fired, Lost 36lbs, A1C down by 1.5 points to 6.6

**EDIT 1**

Thanks for all the support!

Here are a few answers...

The shakes are just low sugar/carb protein shakes, that do exactly what their name states. [Helps Control you glucose levels.] (http://www.boost.com/nutritional-drinks/boost-glucose-control) They feel a little small to start with, and even towards the later weeks you will have some hunger.  Depending on how much water you take in between meals and how you eat and chose your veggies, can have a drastic effect on the amount of hunger you get and when you get it.

* Wake up and take 500mg metformin, amino acid, and coconut oil supplement.
* I have my first shake between 0600-0730
* I drink lots of coffee, with Splenda and sugar free creamer (about 6-10 cups)
* Second shake around 1200 plus or minus 30 minutes
* One liter of water between 1130 and 1500
* Second liter from 1500 to about 2200
* Dinner is either my third shake and a salad or a lean piece of chicken or fish and a salad (I do my veggie servings all at once) 


**Build in cheats!**
* Work hard to go by the book the first few weeks.
* Monitor your blood sugar often.
* Allow yourself to have a treat now and then, but only one and not ever day (See's sugar free Chocolate almond clusters were mine)
* For me weighing myself helped a lot to boost my confidence and keep me going.
* Get an at home A1C kit every couple of weeks to see how you are doing. $20.00 at Walgreens.

Since we started the Reddit Diabetes Challenge, I've gotten them even better, staying between 80 and 130 the whole time. Then I got a nasty sinus infection this weekend. Besides a big shot of penicillin and a 5 day antibiotic pill regimen, the doctor also gave me a 6 day steroid (Methylprednisone) that has the possible side effect of ""Diabetics: May affect your blood sugar."" Since I started taking it Monday evening, my blood sugar has been over 300 ever time I've tested. At first, I thought it was a bent canula. FOUR damn infusion sets later, I'm pretty sure it's either the meds or the infection (my BG last night before dinner was 385. Two hours later, it was 350. I figure that if I had a bent canula, then it would have gone up). 

I don't guess there's more to say - I'm just upset about it because 1) I hate that feeling of not being able to control my BG and 2) feeling sick sucks, but feeling sick and having a high BG sucks extra.

UPDATE: Morning BG was 300. I took a big bolus to counter this, but I also took two doses of my steroid. At 9am, my sugar was at 415. Took another big bolus and adjusted basal rate up to +50%. Lunchtime BG was down to 185. Thanks for the support :)"	t5_2qhsj	True

I've been depressed for as long as I can remember, and some days are better than others, but I'm starting to get burned out on life in general, and feel like I did when I was 16 again. 

I recently moved far from home a year ago to try and get a fresh start, but now I know no one except co-workers (in a work environment), and I think that that might have been a poor decision.  Everything is kind of just grey and numb all the time.  NO ONE that knows me would ever think it though, they would probably think I'm actually extremely happy. 

 I've all but stopped taking humalog in order to lose weight with the idea that people will be more attracted to me, and I kinda just don't care about my health/life anymore.  I've been to several therapists and several medications, but they make me feel worse than before.

I guess I'm just wondering how any of you guys deal with depression and T1, or how you guys cope with it all?  I know this isn't necessarily diabetes related solely,  but I'd rather ask you all instead of the general public.

For starters, I dont have diabetes.
From the title, you can deduce who does though.

She has had it for 4 and half years now.
And she used to be real good at managing it, too.
Like a paragon patient to the doctors.

I love this girl. She's in Italy for a few days, and I just now see how grey everything is without her.

Well, what I want to say, really is...what should I do?
She trusts me. She tests and gives insulin when I am around.
I am also the only one she let in on the fact that she has trouble with her sugars.

I am not completely ignorant. Her pancreas cant produce insulin on its own, which regulates blood sugar levels.
Lows cause instantaneous things, highs cause damage later in life.

Basically, I've come to ask you.
As diabetics, what do you want, seek and appreciate in a partner when it comes to diabetes?
I try not to be intrusive or overly aggressive, I just sincerely ask her to take care of herself because she means a lot to me.

What would you want from a partner?
What should be the 10 commandments for people dating diabetics?

I want to completely understand everything.
She will be away for a couple of days.

Tell me everything. The details, the lows, the highs, the food, the exercise, the sleep habits, literally, I want to use everything in the arsenal to help my girl manage.

I'm a bit tired atm, so i apologize up front for any spelling errors or if I am not making much sense.


EDIT :
Another helpful thing I may have forgot to mention, we are in Europe, and if I remember correctly, different measuring systems are used for blood sugars.
What she told me is that 5,6,7 and acceptable.
Her worst ever being a few months ago at 27.
She does not drink, and neither do I.
We both used to smoke, a small amount, mostly 3 a day.
Neither of us has smoked for a month come tuesday.
Also, regular meals play a large part, dont they?
How many and when, and what amount?

She is two years my senior, and currently studying for college entrance exams.
On top of this, its the end of the school year, and we both attend a school for talented pupils.
A lot to study, with a side-dish of a lot to study.
She acts in a local theater downtown.
She teachers guitar at a studio.

She is a talented, busy girl.
These are things she enjoys, and I think that it will be better once the college thing blows over, she worries herself into bits.
Again, sorry, Im a bit tired and probably cant articulate what I want to say properly, but oh well.


Thanks in advance.

Up until I had to start doing my own injections, things were going just great, A1cs of 6-7.


Ever since doing my own, though, I've been going downhill. I forget to take my insulin, I forget to eat, I get distracted, can't remember whether I have or haven't done them.


All the while, my mother is constantly bothering me about becoming less reliant on her when it comes to my units and I think she might be right. I do tend to rely on other people in order to remember to do anything these days, and the depression isn't helping any.

I know all the [Do's and Dont's of Diabetes Ettiquette](http://www.behavioraldiabetesinstitute.org/downloads/Etiquette-Card.pdf#zoom=100) covered in the top bar there, I had a T1 friend in High School. However I never cooked him dinner and now I have to for a lovely girl I met the other night, and I'm a little unsure and nervous about screwing it up somehow.

So, what are the Do's and Don'ts of cooking for a T1 Diabetic? I understand the basics like keeping sugars to an absolute minimum, but what would be the best thing to make and what are some excellent substitutes? What other food types should I avoid?

She doesn't eat red meat or pork, and doesn't like spicy so I was thinking a basic chicken dish. Again, any advice is welcome, especially dating advice since it has been a while since I was on a date, haha! Thanks guys!

Edit: You guys are super helpful! I'm learning a lot and that makes me almost excited as I am for the date itself (almost). Keep carbs low, no surprise desserts, anything with carbs should be able to be portioned easily, and talk to her about her diet and how *she* handles her diabetes. All great points! Thanks for the help!

I couldn't have picked a better time to finally pick up [Dark Was The Night](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Was_the_Night), it really set a good mood! Anyway, your advice was indispensable, and although I used it, I never once brought up *why* I had unsweetened ice tea in my fridge, haha. I kept track of the carbs, but didn't need to it seemed (as a lot of you said I wouldn't have to, but better to know, just in case), and when I was looking for a canned veggie for a side she could tell I was glancing at the nutritional facts and looked at me and just said ""I like creamed corn,"" with a smile.

There's a lot of misinformation and ignorance regarding keto. And I believe this is done to the detriment of our community.  Many here would benefit greatly from such a diet, but are being scared off by misinformation. 

Keto diets (like everything else you do) should be done carefully, but with just a moderate amount of oversight appear to be absolutely safe.

Would a cancer joke have worked there? How about MS or alcoholism or AIDS or Alzheimer's?

Not only is the diabetes punch line (and I've seen it here and there before) so fucking offensive to quite a number of viewers, it's also reinforcing misinformation and stereotyping bearers of this disease.

I'd like to say a great big ""fuck you"" to NBC for its ignorance and mean spirit.

And my housemates are mad because I either ""go out"" or ""shut myself away in my room"". Half the time ""I'm out"" I am the doctors or at uni and when I come home I just want to be alone and recover.

1368206779.0	1e2vie	Important! I have found that Viagra increases blood flow to my feet and gums.	blindtranche	28	10	26	"I think this is extremely important for all diabetics, but I am not a doctor. Please try and please research for yourselves. When my feet start to get that funny numb, but not altogether numb feeling (many of you will know what I mean), I take Viagra and it is like magic. I compare it to a flower blooming. My feet return to normal. I can even feel it in my gums.

If, as a kid, you ever played outside in the cold until your feet got a little numb and then came inside and they warmed up and the feeling returned, it is exactly like that.

Viagra research started looking for a cardiac drug. It works by relaxing the smooth muscles of blood vessels. The vessels relax and blood flow increases. This happens in the entire body, not just the penis. It works through a Nitric Oxide cascade (Not Nitrous Oxide) in the body. Nitric Oxide also softens the endothelial cells that line blood vessels keeping them supple so they don't leak.

I am a T1 and I have been taking a half a 100mg tablet of Viagra (50mg) every few days for over two years now and I don't know what I would do if I couldn't get it. I am sure it is helping with my eyes as well. My optometrist keeps looking for problems, but so far, I am good. 

Even if you are not noticing any numbness, try a dose of Viagra and see if it doesn't have a salubrious effect that you can feel. Viagra is pretty safe, they prescribe it to a lot of very old men. 

Personally, and again I am not a doctor, I think all diabetics should take a small prophylactic dose of Viagra or one of the other similar drugs like Cialis every few days. Cialis might even be better as it lasts longer. I think pharmaceutical companies are missing a huge market. Worse, I think a lot of diabetics who could prevent or at least slow the onset of neuropathy aren't doing so because they don't know of anything to do. Lyrica only treats the after effects, it does nothing to slow the progress.

Check with your doctor and try Viagra or Cialis. Please let me know if you think I an wrong or this is a bad idea. I am pretty well convinced based on my 2 years of experience, but I am only one old guy."	t5_2qhsj	True

My A1c has always been great, but I had started having highs and lows between 38 and 380, and I felt increased visibility would address that. 

I was told if I wanted a CGM, I might as well get a pump too (while I was spending my insurance deductable), and that the Medtronic pump/cgm system work well together. 

I tried a demo pump, it seemed like a pretty cool system, and the thought of not doing shots all the time blew my mind. It seemed like it would be life changing.

Thursday last week, I finally had my pump orientation and got hooked up with the CGM and pump, same day. It's been neat, but as the novelty wears off, and the reality sets in, I'm left feeling like I got stuck with something I didn't want.

With shots, which I was FINE with, I could always ""put down"" my diabetes and go be a normal person. I could leave my kit in the car and go lay in the sun, or toss it in my pack and go hiking, or leave it in the living room, etc. 

Now, it's there, stuck to my body, dangling from me, every minute of the day. I can't forget it. And anybody that sees me with my shirt off (summer is coming, after all) Is going to gawk, wonder, or ask. I don't want that. 

Am I just going through the anger phase in my adjustment? I just wanted a damn CGM, a patch on my arm or hip. Not a fucking 1995-looking pager dangling from my side. I am strongly tempted to just tear this stupid thing off and go back to my pens. 

(By the way, as for bg control, the data is very cool, and we've configured my pump reasonably well off the bat. I think my basal rates need some slight adjustment, but overall it's been able to maintain the status quo as far as numbers go -- not improve.)

1359074054.0	1783p9	So my doctor called the police on me... (vent)	Mahcks	24	5	15	"Yesterday, I went to the Diabetes Center of America with complaints about my new meter. I hadn't used a meter in the last year because I really didn't care. Around that time (I'm guessing April or so) DCoA called me to tell me that I needed to come in and get a new meter because my insurance wouldn't cover my old strips. I didn't until recently when they stopped refilling my insulin.

Anyway, this new meter is frustrating. Half of the strips give me errors, so I went back to DCoA to see alternatives. I've been trying to get back on track lately, so I've been feeling more sensitive to highs and lows. At DCoA I asked again why I couldn't use the strips for my old meter. In the interest of fairness, I will admit that I was very angry. They were telling me that the pharmacy gave me the wrong strips, which I don't care about. I was missing work to get this sorted out. I felt that they were wasting my time investigating someone's mistake.

The person at the counter told me that they received a letter back in April of 2012 indicating the old strips were no longer covered. I didn't think to ask who sent it or for a copy of the letter. I just accepted it and asked quite bluntly for any meter that works. 

Now, today. I decided to get on the phone with my insurance company to find out why they don't cover those strips anymore. They told me that they do still cover them and have for years now. I ask them about a letter. They said they had no record of it. 

Now, I've been trying to deal with DCoA for far longer than I should have. I feel their knowledge is limited and each time I visit all I get is advertisements about the same products I've already tried. They offer me nothing more than my A1C and prescriptions. That's it. I'm not there to make nice or chat.

When I got there, I asked the person at the counter (not the same woman as yesterday) for a copy of the letter that they received indicating that my insurance would no longer cover my strips. Instead she disappears to the back and calls my pharmacy. I don't know why. She put her hand over the phone and told me that I would have to pay out of pocket for the strips. 

I told her that was inaccurate, so she hands me the phone with my pharmacist on the line. First I asked if my strips are covered. She says yes. Then I asked if they ever sent a letter to my doctor indicating otherwise. She had no record. I hung the phone up and asked the woman in the office again for the letter, but she only offered to get me a prescription for my old strips.

By this point I'm pretty tired of her changing the subject. I was getting angry, so I stepped out into the hall to clear my head and try to decide what to do next. I decided to go back and ask them why they would lie to me about all of this. Obviously, I should have just left and found a doctor I can trust, but I went back.

They locked the doors. I stood there for a moment trying to think of what my next move ought to be. I ended up writing a note stating my original intent of getting to the bottom of this situation, sliding it under the door, and walking away. I would like to add that during my time in the office today I did not cause a scene. I kept my voice manageable and my language civil. I did not threaten anyone or destroy any property. 

When I exited the building, a police officer was waiting for me. I couldn't believe it! No arrest or charges, though. I'm still shaken up about it. I don't think of myself as a scary person, but these people were obviously scared of me. It's really bothering me. 

I know now that they were lying to me, but I can't figure out any reason. This disease is frustrating enough without my doctor's office telling me lies. I keep hoping I'm just barking at shadows and being paranoid, but I can't figure it any other way. I keep hoping someone will slap some sense into me, but everyone I tell seems to think I'm right. 

I really just wanted to get this off my chest, but any thoughts? Please be honest."	t5_2qhsj	True
1358773244.0	16zird	"Update -  ""My T1 son's about to go on a pump - any advice or pointers?"""	sho19132	22	2	14	"We had our training on Saturday, and my son started the pump that afternoon - it's an Animas Ping.  I wanted to let any one interested know how it's going.  (I had asked for advice to prepare for the pump training in [this post).](http://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/16osgr/my_t1_sons_about_to_go_on_a_pump_any_advice_or/)

The morning actually started out with a bit of a snafu - we had arranged a time to meet with the diabetes educator, but didn't discuss *location*.  We were outside or doctor's office across town when we got a call from her - she was at our front door.  We didn't realize that they do the pump training at the patient's home.  So, we got to a bit of a late start. 

Once we got back home, things went pretty well.  It's actually a good thing the training was at our house, because my guy and his little brother were able to play video games while his mom and I learned how to use the pump.  (We've started showing him how some of the stuff works, but at this point we don't want him operating too much himself - the educator told us about one patient who they had to take off the pump, because he figured out how to open it and started giving himself extra insulin whenever he wanted a sweet snack before dinner.)

I won’t go over all the details of the training here – if you have a pump you know how it works, and if you don’t then you probably don’t need to know them.  However, if anyone has any questions feel free to ask me in this thread or PM me.  (Just keep in mind I’m not a medical professional – any answer or advice I have is probably just my own uneducated guess.)

As part of the training, my wife and I got to look over the different types of insets and [practiced putting them in each other]( http://imgur.com/ic26rld).  She still has hers in – she told my son she’d keep it in until it was time to change his.

It was a bit traumatic when it actually came time to do his insertion.  He was excited about the pump, but once it came time to put it on he got a bit scared.  At the advice of the educator, we didn’t bring him in to watch me and my wife do our insertions – the Animas insets use a wicked-looking needle and make a loud pop when they go in (though I didn’t think it hurt any more than a regular injection – I’m not diabetic, but I took quite a few saline shots when we were getting my son used to his insulin this summer).  

He wouldn’t hold still for the insertion, so I ended up having to hold him for it – it wasn’t easy.  When it was over, the educator said that we had almost reached the point where she was going to suggest waiting to start the pump.  He complained about it hurting at first, but I think it was more mental than physical – he forgot about it as soon as I whipped out a new Skylander toy for his being so brave.  He and his brother went back to playing video games, and ten minutes after we did it he just shrugged when I asked if it still hurt.

The night after we started the pump was a little rough.  We had to keep track of him through the night, of course, and his blood sugar kept going up.  His mom got a bit worried, because we’ve always managed to keep a very tight rein on his numbers.  

After calling the diabetes clinic’s after-hours number around 1 a.m., she had to give him a correction by injection and change the infusion site.  Apparently his fighting us during the insertion resulted in a kink in the inset.  The second insertion went a little easier – either because he was exhausted (it happened around 1 or 2 a.m.) or because he knew it wouldn’t hurt too bad.

The new insertion seemed to fix things.  He was still a little high the following morning, but the educator said that was probably due to the conservative basal rate we programmed into the pump.  Insulin through a pump can sometimes work a little more efficiently, so they had us start of with a lower amount in insulin than he was getting through injections.  

He had ok numbers throughout the day – a little higher than normal, but low enough to show he was getting insulin.  We increased the basal rate last night, and as of this morning he is getting back down to where we are usually able to keep it. 

Once the trauma of the first insertion was over, my guy was excited about the pump again.  His mom took him for a walk yesterday afternoon, and he stopped everyone they met to show it off.  

They ran into a couple of kids from his school, and he was able to demonstrate how tough he is – one girl asked “does that tube stick into your stomach?!?” in a bit of a horrified tone, and he respond “yeah” like it was no big deal.  (When we have to do shots in front of his friends, he likes to pretend he didn’t even notice it – he’ll say “Dad, when’re you going to do it?  I have stuff to do!”)  Of course, I’m probably going to need to have another Skylander hidden away for when we do the next insertion on Tuesday, just in case.

The first night of pumping was a bit tough for us, and my wife was having second thoughts about it because of the problem with the first insertion, but after yesterday we were pretty happy with it.  

All the built in features of the pump are going to make things a bit easier to manage – this is going to let my guy live a bit more like he did before he was diagnosed last summer.  (I’m actually kind of worried it might make things too easy for him – I’ve reminded him a few times that even though we don’t need to give him shots, he still can’t just graze on snacks without us figuring out how many carbs he is getting and doing a correction.)  

One thing we don't care for is the built-in meter - we love the fact that it sends the BG to the pump, but the meter itself is a bit slower than the Accu-Chek Nano we had been using, the strips are really tiny (my mom is going to have a hard time using them), and it seems to need a little more blood - we've errored out several of the strips because we didn't use enough.  Other than that, though, so far we are very happy with the Animas pump.

**TL;DR – We had our pump training ([I took a pic for some of that sweet, sweet karma]( http://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/16w9rp/pump_training_today/)!).  He got scared and fought during the first insertion.  He got high blood sugar that night and needed a new insertion.  He’s happy with the pump now, is doing well, and got to show a girl from his school how tough he is.  We're all happy with the pump.**"	t5_2qhsj	True

Just having one of those days where you go to bed way too early - forgetting to take the evening lantus (and not testing post dinner). Waking up at 6:00am HI (hello back, jerk) on the meter. It's gloomy outside, chilly, rainy, and I still feel off over 6 hours later.

So I guess things to take away from this
1) even if you ""always"" remember, it's a good idea to set an alarm on your phone for lantus (I even have one, it's just off, ow my hubris)
2) it really pays off to be open and honest w/ your boss and supervisors about diabetes, and not using as a constant excuse - so that when the time comes you just feel off and kinda messed up, you're given a bit of space.

These videos will give you the basics of the psychology behind what you are trying to do.  You are ‘shaping’ your dog’s behavior, through manipulating operant conditioning principles.  If you do not understand the ‘shaping’ video, you will not have a good time training your dog.  Pay attention to ‘extinction’ in the operant conditioning video, this is what you want to avoid.

[Classical Conditioning]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ3dLm2j5uk)

[Operant Conditioning]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8vIbuoktew)

[Shaping]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCUWHP4YDgU)

First of all NEVER use punishments. Ever.  Reward wanted behavior, but DO NOT punish mistakes.  Using punishment gains results quicker, but at the cost of a nervous/scared dog.  It is not worth it. (Plus do you really want your dog to be afraid of you?)  Second, think like a dog.  How do dogs think? Dogs think like children.  They make simple associations, but do not abstractly make complex associations. (Or maybe they do, but for our intents and purposes assume they have the intelligence level of a child.)  Always wait until he has each step down nearly perfectly before moving on.  Patience and consistency are your allies.

[Intro Video]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNLJ6OP4Z1A)

[Overview of DAD training]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdOJ6PxehZE)

[**Clicker Training**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15vKqCSNhqY)

Clicker training is beneficial for 2 reasons.  Once the dog associates the click with reward, it is easier to let the dog know what behavior it is getting rewarded for – if you give the treat a little late it is no big deal because the click will signal that a reward is coming; the click should occur right after the correct behavior occurs.  The second reason is once the dog is clicker trained treats do not have to follow every single click, just enough clicks that the dog does not lose the ‘click means reward’ association. 
 
Clicker training is simple.  Click, treat.  Click, treat. Just make sure the treat follows directly after the click, and do not give the treat before the click as this will confuse the dog.   Consistency is key for all aspects of the training, especially this part.  Do the ‘click, treat’ multiple times in a row in a ‘session’ (like in the video), but also randomly throughout the day.  Once the dog is clicker trained you do not have to follow every click with a treat, but be sure to follow clicks with treats every now and then to maintain the ‘click means reward’ association.

**Picking a Cue**

This part is your preference, but you will need to think “What behavior do I want my dog to do when my blood sugar is off?” I have a medical alert tattoo on my forearm, so for me I would choose having him lick the tattoo when my blood sugar is low.  Other good options would be to bring you something, like a dog toy or a tester kit, just be sure to never let him otherwise use these objects.  If it is a toy, the only time he touches it is when you are training him or he is alerting you.  If it is a blood testing kit, it is an extra one for the sole purpose of him bringing it to you, do not use it daily as your blood testing kit.

**Blood Sugar Scent**

The dogs pick up on the scent we emit when our blood sugar is low/high.  To capture this scent get some clean rags or dishtowels and wait until your sugars are low/high and rub the rags all over your body, trying to get your sweat on them (that notorious low sugar sweating is what you want on the rags) and them store those in a ziplock bag in the fridge, making new ‘scent rags’ whenever possible to keep the smell fresh. I have also heard saliva works for the scent rags.  

**Associating Scent Rag with Reward**

Next put one of the rags out somewhere around your house somewhere.  This part is a waiting game.  Once the dog shows interest in the rag, preferably by going up and sniffing it, give him a click (he should be clicker trained by this point).  Keep doing this until he starts associating “scent rag means click, click means reward”.  After he gets good at realizing “hey that scent rag is out, if I go smell it I get rewarded” start hiding the scent rag and reward him when he finds it.  This will make him realize he needs to go looking for this scent and it may not be out in an obvious place.  Once he has this association down move on to his cue.

**Associating Scent Rag with Cue**

This will probably be the hardest part.  Continuing the same method as before, once he finds the rag though, do not reward him right away.  Instead wait until he gets closer to the cue.  As an example I’ll use licking my tattoo as the cue.   Now when he finds the rag I will wait until he moves a little closer to my arm, and then reward him.  In his mind he will be thinking along the lines of “Hey! I found the rag, man, where’s my reward?” (He will be confused, but this is good.) then he moves towards my arm, BAM, reward.   Then wait until he gets closer and closer to the cue.  Eventually he will be all up on my arm, but I won’t reward him until he licks the tattoo.  Continue this until his association becomes “scent rag means I have to lick the tattoo, licking the tattoo means reward.” Once he has that association down you have a dog that will alert you when your blood sugars low.  Be sure to continue rewarding him when he correctly alerts you to a low blood sugar to avoid ‘extinction’.

1) Keep 50 test strips for EMERGENCY ONLY. I had plenty, but it would have added to the stress if I was running short

2) Don't risk your life when you have other options - know your bodies limit. Im glad I went to the hospital, it was much safer there

Edit to add:  So, here's my story. About 8 years ago, I was diagnosed with PCOS, and started taking Metformin to treat that. It didn't help much, my blood sugar remained consistently borderline, and I went off and on the medicine over the years, depending on if I had insurance and could see a doctor. About a year ago, I finally got solid health insurance, and went to see an Endo for help with concieving. She diagnosed me with Hypothyroidism, and Insulin Resistance, and put me back on Mteformin. Because I wasn't ""diabetic enough"", insurance refused to cover any treatments that could prevent me from crossing that line into T2 diagnosis territory. Then finally the day came, where my A1C was 7.5, and my fasting BG was 160. It was almost a godsend to finally have a diagnosis, because, now my insurance pays for things.

And that's when things changed: My doctor added Bydureon to the perscription mix (I'm also taking several thyroid medications, and lots of vitamins because I was deficient in just about every fat soluble vitamin that exists). It's now covered for me to see a nutritionist who got me started a low calorie, low fat, low carb diet. I eat betweeen 1300 and 1500 calories a day, no more than 180 carbs per day, with 45-60 carbs per meal. There was about a month lag in between starting bydureon and seeing the nutritionist, in that time, I lost 5 pounds without really trying (which has been unheard of in my life before this). In the first month since seeing the nutritionist I lost an aditional 15 pounds (which is REALLY unheard of for me. In the past I would eat dangerously low amounts of food, and work out 2-3 hours a day just to drop about 1 pound per week). I haven't added any real serious excersise at this point beyond playing Kinect games with my husband and doing renno projects around the house."	t5_2qhsj	True

Just thought I'd give an update and vent a little and ask a few questions. 


My blood sugar has been anywhere from ~250 to &lt;1000mg/dl. I am not sure what the normal swing is so I don't really know whether to be worried or not. I get my labs done after I eat though. I also get 3 units of insulin (the short duration kind, I don't remember the name) before each meal. The doctor doesn't seem worried about it so that's probably a good thing. 

They have also been running two bags of saline with a potassium booster before I go to be each night. I have had some joint problems as a result. Nothing huge, just my thumbs and toes getting really stiff when balled up. 

I am supposed to be medevaced out of country soon. For those who don't know, medevac is a medical evacuation on a specially fitted aircraft. They can't official say or sure what type I have but my attending is 99% sure it's type 1. As far as I know, this is the one that requires insulin therapy for life. Awesome right? Genetics hates me. ""Oh you're almost completely bald at 26, here have some diabetes.""

My greatest fear isn't the lifestyle and dietary changes. My greatest fear now is if I will be able to stay in the air force. It's basically how I identify myself. I love the military and I love serving but I am terrified this may dismiss me from service. My wife and I have had some good cries and some good laughs since we found out. We laugh a lot about Wilfred Brimley. Funny thing is I was making jokes about him the day before I got my labs done. Karma is a bitch. I still make jokes now, but they are at my expense. I've been trying to keep my chin. As much as I laugh at others' expense, fuck me if I can't take a joke right?

I haven't been over the dietary restrictions yet with my doctor, mostly because there is nothing they can do about the food here anyway. We don't get a lot of choice in what we can eat. It's all cafeteria style and   everything is either fried or glazed. They do have a ""salad bar"" but it hasn't had lettuce for two weeks now. They do have a lot of fresh fruit though. Is that ok to eat? 

Sorry for such a long post/rant. It's just nice to get this stuff off my chest. 

TL;DR: I am getting medevaced out of Afghanistan due to ""potential"" diabetes and I am scared shitless about my future. Thanks for reading.  I'll be back."	t5_2qhsj	True

I also get really bad, constant headaches now. Probably from BS not being stable? (Crying all the type doesn't help headaches either..) My Dr prescribed a ""headache medicine"" but it doesn't even make a dent...

I mean, I understand that I'm gunna be okay and I'm gunna learn and figure it all out.. I just can't stop being so sad. Was anyone diagnosed in their young adult life with a similar reaction?

LadyBladey	21	4	30	"This is pretty difficult to type out as it's not something I care to admit to anyone, including myself, but I have been and continue to be a 'bad' diabetic. I try very hard to eat correctly and exercise. I've never touched alcohol or a cigarette, or any substance for that matter. It works wonders in regards to people thinking that I take care of myself. It leaves less questioning by my family and friends. The truth is I am so afraid of hypoglycemic episodes that I tend to let my sugar run higher (sometimes much higher) than I should. I am 26 years old, diagnosed at 13 as a T1 with an A1C that rarely makes it down to 8. I have a paralyzing fear of having my blood drawn which is what limits a lot of my trips to the endo. They always want blood drawn and I can't seem to go through with it as often as they'd like, so I simply don't go. This year I've decided that that has to stop. All of it, the phobias, the excuses, the complacency. I don't want to be 30 and on dialysis, losing my vision, or worried that every time I get a cut on an extremity that this is the time it won't heal. I've decided to move to a pump and decided to, very bluntly speaking, grow up. I've made excuse after (pitiful) excuse to convince myself that the pump wouldn't be right for me, that it's too much of a change but the truth is that something really does needs to change. 

Anyway, most of this is just venting but I see how amazing this community is and I want to be one of the people that posts here with an A1C of 6. I want to have this under control for the first time in my life. I guess I'm just looking for words of encouragement. I'm a typically paranoid person and a major change like this really makes me uneasy. My doctors have pushed for this for a long time and I hear nothing but good things regarding how much better control you have. My attitude has changed and it's time to put something behind that and change my lifestyle. So here's to that, I hope to have an update sometime soon with some progress. First thing is first, lab work, going this week and then I can meet with my endo again. Wish me luck... "	t5_2qhsj	True

1350196729.0	11g9w8	My 8 month old daughter was diagnosed the other day.	gurana	19	2	31	"When my daughter was 7 weeks old, we took her to the ER for labored breathing. She wasn't there long when they made the call to medevac her to a nearby children's hospital with a very highly regarded PICU. Thank goodness my wife is a nurse and was able to spot trouble much earlier than I. She stayed in the PICU for a week with bi-lateral pnemonia. I've got two older boys and the middle kid spent a few nights in the hospital with something similar when he was about a year old, which is what I was kind of expecting for her. The fact that they called a helicopter to pick her up was my first clue that things were kind of serious. About the second night in the PICU I started to notice all the other kids around her and the terrible condition most of them were in... it dawned on me that my little girl must be pretty bad off for them to keep her here for an extended period. She spent the majority of her time there on a CPAP machine. We had to wear gowns, masks and gloves the entire time we were at the bedside. It was a fairy trying experience. In the end though we felt that we were better parents for the things we learned.

My little girl has been fuss free at night since about 3 months of age. I've been working late the last week or so. Getting home about 11:30 or midnight each night the begning of this week my wife had told me that the baby was uncharacteristically crying for several hours unable to get to sleep. On wednesday, we were up much of the night. She had no fever and her breathing was also good though she was slightly rhonchial on one side. We tried giving her some formula and she spit much of it up. Our guess was she might have had a stomach bug. I called out of work Thursday morning and made an appointment with the pediatrician. At one point my wife said her lips looked a little dusky so we headed to the ER rather than wait for the pediatrician's appointment.

My wife and I were in a total state of déjà vu at this point. We got a bed right away... the same one we were in when they told us they were calling a helo transport team. We even joked that this room was a bad omen when we first got there... They took her vitals and some blood and in pretty short order the doctor comes in and said they had some ""interesting"" results from the blood test. When I think back to this scene from just a few days ago this is the point where things get fuzzy. To say this came out of left field would be an understatement.  I would have been caught less off guard if the stig came screaming in on a  zamboni from said field. Suddenly all I percieve is the doctor explaining to us that her her white cell count is elevated which was expected if she's got some sort of infection. However, her glucose was 600+ (I think that's as high as the equipment could read to.) I've got a few Type 2 diabetics in the family. Right away I'm thinking, well that's gotta be a bad reading or something. They're going to re-run the test and also check for ketones... They're worried she may have developed DKA. This immediately knocked the wind out of us. When they draw more blood for another lab test, they bring the small tester for a bedside check. This one read 500... again, this may have been as high as that particular machine could go up to. Any hopes that the lab might have been wrong are almost completely gone, though I still had some irrational hope that this machine was also malfunctioning somehow. At this point the doctor says she's sending us back to the PICU we went to before via ambo this time. We decided that my wife would ride with our girl while I ran home to get a bag. Kind of in shock and very much in denial, I floated out of the ER with phone in hand trying to see if these symptoms can possibly mean anything else.... I don't know what the hell I was expecting to find. Short of an article

The last few days have  been kind of surreal, but my wife and I are coming to terms with the situation as well as anybody can be expected to I suppose. I'm kind of astonished, in a way, how much our lives have changed in just the last couple of days. We spent only one night in the PICU and got transfered to a less critical peds floor the next day. Our stay here has been as much about education for us as much as fine-tuning a regimine for our little girl. I often talk with my wife about her work. Over the years I've kind of absorbed a lot of information about nursing. Enough so that there hasn't been any terminology or concepts that completely went completely over my head. I understand the role of insulin, how DKA develops when there's not enough, what happens if too much is administered and what can we do to address the situation... still, I'm terrified. My wife works nights, so at some point I'm not going to have her there at night to make sure I don't royally fuck something up.

Apparently this diagnosis is rare for someone her age. It's rare enough in any event that none of the protocols they have in place are geared towards someone her age or size. We're in the unit that specializes with diabetic children, but the whole floor is actually set up for ""school age chidlren."" All of the infant related stuff we needed they had to pull from another floor. This knowledge does nothing to help with my confidence in the situation... BTW, if someone on this sub has posted about their child this young similarly diagnosed, I'll probably find your posts about it in short order, but if you were to post resources you've found helpful to the comments here, I wouldn't hate that.

I've spent the last couple of nights reading up on diabetes. I've not been on reddit for very long and it was only just now that it occured to me to see if there was a diabetes subreddit. I opened up a dozen or so tabs worth of posts but thought I'd post a story about how I came to be here first.

I'm not sure what took me so long to get to you, but now that I have found you I'll never leave your side.  

One of the hardest things I have experienced with T1 diabetes is the sense of separation it gives me.  Diabetes is a very personal, very private, very lonely disease.  My friends and family mean well.  They give me a shoulder to lean on and a hand to help me up but there is a disconnect;  there is a valley between empathy and experience.  

I've read so many posts today and though to myself:  ""Holy shit, this guy knows EXACTLY what I'm going through.""

About 2 weeks ago I started getting severe dry mouth, constantly thirsty and just tired all around. I also noticed that my weight was dropping significantly (dropped 20 pounds in about 1 month). Then more recently I started feeling weak, couldn't hold down food and didn't use the ol' #2 for about 4 days. Finally I went into the doc and after some blood work, he broke the news that I was T1. Got my first insulin shot, the whole story, and have an appointment at 10 tomorrow to learn the ropes of injections and what this means for my diet. To give you an idea my BS at the Dr's office was 310. So I am guessing keeping my BS down will be my biggest issue with this. 

I was always pretty healthy, ate fairly well, never a lot of sugar, but I love to drink and that may have been my pitfall. The biggest thing on my mind now is what do I do to keep my BS down? I probably will get all this info tomorrow but I thought I would ask. I also wanted to know about any of you that smoke weed and are T1. I have read a lot that munchies are the biggest risk, but I never really got the munchies in the first place and I have a lot of self control in that sense.

When I was initially diagnosed with Type 1 last year at the age of 25, I was devastated.  I was rather upset for a couple of weeks, and then I quickly got over it.  As weird as it sounds, Diabetes for a couple of months was rather fun.  I enjoyed carb counting and giving myself shots, and then seeing a great bg reading when I had done it right.  Talking to my friends and educating others about the disease was also enjoyable.  But now, 10 months later, the realization and depression is really starting to set in.  I no longer want this, and I want to get rid of it.  The thing is, none of us can.  

Sorry, I just needed a place to come and share my feelings to people who would understand my situation.  Anyone else have similar thoughts; did anyone actually enjoy Diabetes like I did?  And for those of you that have had the disease longer than I have, how do you cope?  I am really bad at dealing with these type of things, so any advice is going to be greatly appreciated.

Long before diagnosis, I went to a Junior High School that had about 400 students, much too large for an individual to know every one on a personal level. From time to time, a girl from another grade would come into our class and ask if anyone had a snack they would give her because she was suffering from a low blood sugar. As a 14 year old, with no understanding of diabetes, I would think to myself ""no way I'm giving this girl my rice crispy treat"". 

Through my diagnosis, and while going through experiencing my first low blood sugars, I was haunted by that girl. It still makes me feel guilty, not ponying up and giving her a stupid snack I didn't need when she must have been feeling so shitty. I have even wondered at times if this is karma's way of kicking me in the ass. 

This may not be the right venue to speak this out on, but I feel like others who have been through coming to terms with diagnosis will understand better. "	t5_2qhsj	True

1375373106.0	1ji1u1	Wonder what a T-1 diabetic in the USA has to spend each year? I thought I'd share my calculated costs.	Diabetic-costs	18	1	31	"I recently went through insurance open enrollment, during which I had to calculate how much money to pull into the flexible health spending account my employer offers (a flexible spending account is an account where a participant’s employer can deposit pre-tax income to be used for eligible out-of-pocket health, dental, drug, and vision expenses).  My young son is a T-1 diabetic using an insulin pump, so to determine how much to put into the account, I came up with a list of the things I think he’ll need over the next 12 months and a rough estimate of the costs for those items.

People occasionally pose questions about the cost for diabetes care, so I thought some of you might find this interesting and/or useful.  

For anyone trying to calculate his or her own expenses, please note that these actual dollar amounts probably don’t have much relevance to what you would pay, unless your insurance happens to be similar to mine.  But some people might find this list of items a useful starting point to calculate their own costs, and those of you in civilized countries might find it interesting to see what someone in the USA has to spend to treat T-1 diabetes.

A bit of information about my insurance coverage – 

I get insurance through my employer - it is a self-insured plan administered by an insurance company acting as a third-party-administrator.

My prescription coverage has three tiers for copayments based on whether a drug is generic or name-brand and whether the plan considers it to be “preferred”: $15, $35, and $60.  My son’s insulin (Novolog) is a tier two drug with a $35 copay for a one month supply.  The glucagon kit is also considered a tier two drug.  We keep three glucagon kits, one at school, one at after-school care, and one in the bag he carries with him.  My son also has problems with car-sickness, so we also always keep Zofran on hand.  The generic version of the drug is cheaper than the required copay so we pay a lower amount for it (it’s usually about $10 for a refill).

My medical coverage also has different levels of copayments, based on provider type.  A specialist visit is $40, so long as there is a current referral on file (the referral has to be renewed every six months).  My son’s pump and CGM supplies count as durable medical equipment under the medical coverage, and for that we have a 20 percent coinsurance payment as long as we go to an in-network provider.

My plan has an annual $2,000 out-of-pocket limit for coinsurance payments – that is the maximum amount I have to pay for coinsurance on him for any one year.  It doesn’t look like I’ll reach that limit this year (unless something bad happens), but it did benefit us the first year he was diagnosed.  We met the $2,000 out-of-pocket limit with the cost of his hospital stay, so his pump and CMG were covered at 100 percent because we got them before the end of the year.  (If we had waited until the next year, it would have cost us $2,000 for those two things - we would have paid the out-of-pocket max again.)  His testing strips and his pump and CGM supplies were also covered at 100 percent until the end of that first year.

I’m posting this under a throw-away account, because I’d rather not have this detailed medical and financial information associated with my regular user name.  I’ll be happy to answer questions, though if there are more than a few I might not be able to get to them all until this weekend.  

If you think the list below is missing anything I should have included, please point it out and I’ll update it.  (FYI – I threw this list together pretty quickly.  Once it was clear I’d spend at least about $2,000 on diabetic supplies I stopped adding to it and decided to pull the maximum allowed amount of $2,500 into my flexible health spending account – with the additional medical expenses I and the rest of my family will probably have, I’m sure I’ll use it all.)

I was diagnosed at 8 years old, and as a kid I usually took pretty good care of myself. In high school I went through my ""rejection"" phase. You know, that phase when you decide that you don't really have to take care of yourself, because nothing is ever going to happen to you because you're indestructible, so you just stop taking insulin for snacks or meals. I got over that after graduation and did okay during my first two years of college. Then I moved out of my parent's house and lost a lot of support from people that I know. So I got lazy. It's not that I want to reject the fact that I have diabetes now, it's just that I don't care, I guess.

So I went to a new endo yesterday (change of insurance, yada yada) and he looked at the information in my pump and told me, ""there's really not enough information here for us to make any changes."" I told him, ""I know, it's really bad and I just don't know what to do to fix it."" He suggested that I go back to the basics. Back to when I was first diagnosed, and had a regimented meal schedule, and looked at nutrition labels to get carb counts.

I can't believe no one had ever thought of this before. It's so genius. In the past my endo had suggested, ""well at least check when you wake up"", or ""always give yourself insulin for dinner."" The little things work for some people, but for me, I have to go big or go home. If it doesn't change everything, I'm just going to slip back into my bad habits. I'm starting my new plan tomorrow and I have a really good feeling about it!

TL;DR - I have gotten lazy with diabetes care; endo suggested go back to basics (3 meals a day, no snacking), I think it's genius!"	t5_2qhsj	True

Clayflow	18	3	24	"I was diagnosed when I was a freshmen in high school, really seemed to have no problem during my high school years controlling it, I played sports, I worked a part-time job, etc. After high school I graduated and really was unable to go to college, not because of grades, sat scores, or my diabetes, but just from a financial point.

So I stayed at home at worked full-time, taking a few classes at my local Community college on the side. And slowly began to lose the grip I had on my T1. My a1c slowly began to rise. 7.2, 8.0, 9.4, and finally about 6 months ago, it was at an all time high, a 10.2. I stood on the scale at my appointment and saw I was only 133 pounds, I came home from that appointment and sat down and just looked at my skinny arms, and legs, and realized that I was slowly killing myself, to some extent, and realized that I needed to do something.

I just had another endo appointment about a week ago and my a1c came back down to a 9.1, but I'm still too scared to stand on the scale and look at what I'm at, because I know it hasn't been long and I know I'm not going to gain 25 pounds in a week. I just thought I'd share this, because I really don't have anyone else to talk to about it. 

I also think part of the reason I ran myself higher was because of my fear of going so low I pass out. It's (knock on wood) never happened to me, and half of the reason is the fear of the unknown. I know this might not make sense to some, but it does to me. "	t5_2qhsj	True

They initially thought it was Type 2 and put me on metformin for a week. But then I went to see a better doctor who actually did the proper bloodtests to see that it was Type 1. I'm currently dealing with some monetary issues, but should be put on novolog and lantus within about three weeks. For now, I'm on novolin n. My blood sugar levels are up and down a lot, and it seems pretty unpredictable. (Hoping that I'll have more control once I get the lantus and novolog.)

I find myself getting really irritated about things lately. Really stupid things. I also keep finding myself wishing people would just leave me alone for awhile. I've been ignoring people's calls/texts, and making excuses to not spend time with people. I just feel like I have this weird headache all the time, and being with people makes me really irritable, even if they are doing nothing wrong. For instance today, I had an apartment-mate/friend knock on my door twice, as well as call twice. Ignored him each time because I just don't feel like spending time with him - or anyone really - at the moment.

I'm kind of an introvert, but I'm generally not antisocial like this. The thought of being around people right now just kind of exhausts me, because when I am my mood is just up and down so much that it's hard for me to keep a positive attitude. I'm generally a nice guy, but lately I've just felt more inclined to be an ass to people. Not like me at all.

I think I've suffered from minor depression for a few years (nothing too major) but it seems to be coming in larger waves over the past few weeks, and I've been having a lot of mood swings.

Just wondering if anybody else experiences similar emotions? I'm sure that a big part of it is just the stress of being diagnosed on top of work and school. (I started a new job the same week I was diagnosed.) I'm working on it, and I think as time goes on I should get a better emotional handle on things. But I am wondering if having blood sugar levels bounce around so much can affect that as well.(With the novolin, I seem to be bouncing anywhere between 70 and 190 on most days, and it seems pretty sudden out of the blue a lot of the time).

Consequently, the best feeling in the world is the come up from a low.  It feels like life is being restored to my body, as if I'm being reborn.  It's actually kinda nice (once the stupid adrenaline dies down).  Also, eating whatever to counteract hypoglycemia is pretty nice too ;)

Up until now I have been really turned off by the constant visible reminder of my diabetes but it seems that the potential health benefits may outweigh those issues now. I do have a few question first though.

1. Sex. My boyfriend is very supportive and helpful with my diabetes and would never tell me that I am not beautiful because of a pump but I am just concerned that it would make me feel less sexy. I don't want it to be an unspoken turn off for both of us. How do you ladies with a pump deal with this?

2. Bathing suits and swimming. I love to go to the pool for both lap swimming and just lounging and having fun. Now that it's summer time and all the bikinis are out what's the best way to handle a day at the pool? Can the pump be in the sun for that long (I know my pens can't get too hot or they don't work as well)? Also lap swimming, can I just take it off? I know for sure it will get in the way. 

3. Just the general constant physical reminder of your diabetes. I have pretty good control now (hba1c 6.4) but I would love for it to be lower (hence the pump questions) but I also love just being able to be a regular person to most people and not constantly fielding questions about it. Is this an issue for people is it easy to hide?

I can still reach climax and get the feeling, but nothing comes out. I studied up on it and it seems to be called ""retrograde ejaculation"" where the nerve that forces the semen out stops functioning and it goes into the bladder instead of out the urethra like it should. The benefit of this is there is basically no clean up afterward. lol.

When I did research on it, I could not find if there were any options on ways this could be fixed or options for creating a family (I have basically accepted that I will never have children naturally at this point).

I'm curious if others have had this problem (feel free to use alts) and what they have done about it or what their docs may have said, as I can't seem to bring myself to bring it up with my doctor. Someday perhaps I will, but for many reasons outside of it just being embarrassing, I just am not able to discuss it with someone on a face to face level.

I can still get erections (though that has also gotten more difficult to obtain over time) but in the end, I won't be providing any money shots and it's pretty embarrassing.

So anyway, does anyone out there know if i'm just stuck with a dry hose for good, or if there might be some IVF type option for dudes with this type of problem? Anyone else out there able to relate?

I really am not seriously bothered about not being able to have kids, but I still feel emasculated ya know? And if I end up with erectile dysfunction, that would be a pretty big bummer.

I did a 2 1/2 hour check (I WAS playing street hockey) and I went from 97 pre to 112 at the post check. Then, I had cake. Like, probably 100 carbs worth of cake. If not more. I checked 2 hours after to make sure I wasn't astronomical, but hell, I was 121. What the hell does that even mean? I mean, come on.

One way of thinking about it is this: Being diabetic is like running a 50 mile race. It's the same race as everybody else, except you’re doing it with a 50kg back pack on. So it’s just that much harder to keep up.
 

The problem is that the bag isn’t always 50kg. Sometimes it’s only 10kg, and other days it’s 100kg; and you never know how heavy it’s going to be. Even on the light days the bag is still there, it’s just easier. But it might shift, and grow heavier as you run, making it harder to keep going. And whilst you can carry 100kg on your shoulders for a short time, after a bit you will struggle and need to stop.
 

No one else can carry the back pack for you, and you can never take it off, ever. So, when the bag is heavy you don’t want to complain; no one else can feel it, no one can take this bag off you, so they will not know how you feel. And the back pack is heavy a lot. If you were to complain every time life got difficult you would never get a break. So you suck it up, and make the effort to keep up and look like it’s not a heavy load; even when you’re struggling to keep walking under the weight. 
 

Sometimes people expect you to run just as hard and fast as everybody else. This happens even when they can see the backpack, because they’ve seen you run with it before. But what they don’t realise is that today the bag is 20kg heavier. And sometimes people don’t see the bag, even though they know you carry it, and don’t understand why you ask to slow down a bit.
 

A lot of the time that back-pack is just an extra load to carry, just one of those things, and not really a problem. But at times it can be a struggle, which is why it's so important to have support out there to help us back on our feet if we fall down. "	t5_2qhsj	True

I've had type 1 for 11 years. About a year ago I graduated from college and my A1C was the worst it had ever been by a long shot: 13

I honestly didn't even know they went that high.

Last fall I was diagnosed with a blood clot (unrelated to my diabetes, I have since discovered I have a genetic predisposition to blood clots, really winning the health lottery here) and got reemed out for my A1C by the hospital staff. At that point it was 10, so at least going in the right direction. Nothing pisses me off more than people who don't know what they're talking about condescending to me, though, and these people truly knew nothing about type 1. (for example, none of them understood why I used ""ratios"" to determine my insulin doses, they thought it sounded too ""complicated"", and they wouldn't give me insulin for food, just if my blood sugar was high) I've always known HOW to take care of myself, it's just a matter of getting myself to go through the motions.

Well, that was the turning point I really needed. 3 months ago I had the best A1C I'd ever had: 7.0, and today, my A1C is 6.9, the first time it's ever been in the 6's! What's most encouraging to me is that I've been taking care of myself consistently for 6 months, that's the longest I've ever gone. And I don't feel myself slowing down, yet!

My name is Stephen and I am a final year Computing Science student at the University of Glasgow (UK). As part of my honours project for my final year I am developing an app designed to run on Android phones and aid the self-management of Type 1 diabetes. I am interested in finding out how mobile technology, particularly a smartphone app (Android) can be used to help self-manage the condition. Development has been going well so far, with some helpful input from my younger sister who was diagnosed with T1D last year. However, I am hoping to validate some of the later features (e.g. social media integration, reminder system), that are planned for the app by asking you guys what you think of them.

What I am asking is for you to fill out a short questionnaire asking some very general questions about your diabetes and some of the things you might find useful (or not!) in an app designed to help you. The link for the questionnaire is at the bottom of this post. 

The questionnaire should take no longer than 10 minutes to complete and I very much appreciate any bit of feedback from you. If you need any information regarding my research, I have attached a link to a Google doc that provides much more information. If you are interested in trying out an early prototype of my app, you can send me a message on here or leave your email address with the questionnaire. 

One final thing - my research has been fully approved by my University's ethics committee. However, participants are required to be at least 16 years old. If you are under 16 can I please ask you to get a parent or guardian to fill this out on your behalf?

There's not much I can do.

Some knucklehead takes them out of the bag and puts them directly in the ice. Soaking my meter through. Destroying it. AGH.

1342637779.0	wrv5g	My son was diagnosed with type I yesterday.	sho19132	21	6	56	"My son is five years old – he’ll be six next week.  The last few weeks my son has been urinating a lot more than usual and he’s been complaining about his stomach hurting.  My wife has had a lot of people with type I diabetes in her family, so we’ve always known there was a chance our kids might develop it.  Given the symptoms, we decided we needed to get him checked.

I took him in yesterday afternoon.  His doctor did a urine test, and found sugar in it, and he said diabetes was pretty much the only thing that would do that.

We haven’t met with an endocrinologist or dietician yet.  As soon as we left the doctor’s office, I called the office for the endocrinologist our doctor referred us to.  The nurse said they were booked up until next year, and asked what month we would like to come in.  Next year – I don’t know much about diabetes yet, but I know we can’t wait that long to do anything!  She said that if his doctor called they might be able to get him in sooner.  I spoke to his doctor yesterday evening – he is going to call the endocrinologist’s office this morning to see when we can get him in.

I’m just feeling kind of lost now.  My wife’s brother has diabetes, so she has some idea of what it entails.  This morning she mentioned to me that he usually takes insulin shots five times a day.  

It’s weird, but I can feel myself going through the stages you hear people talk about when they deal with grief – yesterday when I spoke to the doctor, it just didn’t seem real.  I told myself that my brother-in-law has dealt with this for years, and so it wouldn’t be a big thing for my son.  But this morning it is really starting to kick in that in one very big way my son’s life is going to be different from anything I had expected for him.  This is going to be something he lives with – we’re not going to have any more of our Saturday morning donut store trips, we’ll have to carry the blood testing device when we travel and figure out where we can keep his insulin on long trips, he’s going to have to take shots everyday for the rest of his life.  This is the kid I have to hold down every time a nurse gives him a vaccination.  This is the kid who screamed like he was being murdered when his doctor pricked his finger for a blood draw a few years ago.  And I’m going to have to give him shots everyday and help him learn how to give himself shots.

I’m sorry for this wall of text.  I’ve looked though some of the side-bar info for this subreddit, and I’m sure I’ll be coming to you guys with questions.  But right now, looking forward, this just looks so… I’m not sure of the word.  Scary?  Intimidating?  I’m sure in a few weeks or months everything we do will feel normal to us.    But right now…

Update:  We're in the hospital now - his mom brought him
 A few hours ago after our doctor called us back.  (It's screwed up how the endocrinologists we've been referred to take patients - apparently they require new patients to be admitted to an emergency room before they will see them.)

They've got him on an IV drip, and he is doing ok.  His blood sugar was 317 when he came in, but they haven't given him insulin yet.  We're waiting for test results now.  He did well when they put in the IV - the nurse let him play Angry Birds on an iPad while she did it.  I don't think he even noticed her doing it.

Update 2: a doctor just came by and said his ph level is great - no ketoacidosis.  They're going to move him to a different room.

Update 3b:  It looks like my last update didn't save for some reason.  Anyway, I had noted that they moved us to a regular room, and we met with the endocrinologist.  After dinner the nurse showed us how to calculate his insulin dose based on his blood sugar before the meal and his cabs during it.  He's had two doses of insulin now - one after dinner and one before bed.  That first shot was really tough - he was scared of the needle.  He finally took it after me and his mom got shots of saline.  The second shot was a lot easier.

The nurse just checked his blood sugar at 2:00 am, and it was 122 (she also scolded me for sitting up so long  I guess I had better get some sleep.)"	t5_2qhsj	True

Diabetes affects everyone differently, so what motivates *YOU* to take care of diabetes and to stay persistent?

What habits/methods do you think help you stay on top of your care, regardless of how down in the dumps you may be feeling?

         I was diagnosed in 1998, type 1 at the ripe old age of 12. I was put on the pump when i was 18. I have been very good with my low's since becoming a mild cyborg. The last 8 years have been fine with an very occasional low from too much exercise/not enough food. My worst method/routine about the whole thing is that i would rather have a high than a low. This has been the issue with my current endocrinologist for the last 2-3 years. I told my doctor how i felt about this because at the time i lived by myself and couldn't depend on anyone finding me and pouring juice down my throat while seizing. I would rather float in the 200-300 BG then take that risk of not waking up. Since that day i have been labeled 'non compliant.' Lets just say my love for the Healthcare 'Business' has declined rapidly since then, but so has my A1C, so nothing life threatening obviously. I should also mention that i don't test my blood sugar the recommended amount of times, I know when i feel high above 350 (nastiest taste in the world inside of your mouth) and can definitely feel the onset of a low (shakiness/weakness) I don't dcheck 8 times a day for financial reasons. I still test when I'm sick or unsure of how i feel. All that leads us to today. At my appointment, i was confronted by my specialist. Who said that if i didn't start testing 4-6 times a day and dropping off my meter once a month so they would have my numbers they weren't going to treat me anymore/let me go. I honestly understand that they want to help but i don't see the need to threaten me like this, especially since over the last 2 years my A1C has been coming down. My last  was a 6.8. I was infuriated the entire drive back to work, but now i'm just at a loss. The biggest thing to me is i dont understand this Doctors way or the highway mentality, especially when the labs are coming back and I'm doing better doing it as usual. Sorry for the rant, but it fells like as much as they know about my body they still have no f*cking clue sometimes.

TL;DR - I'm 'Non compliant' and was told to comply or be a diabetic without insulin. Thanks Doc.  "	t5_2qhsj	True

And I don’t mean my control or management or the quality of my doctors (although they *are* awesome). I mean with people around me. Why? They don’t make snide, uneducated comments.

How do you know how much to take? What makes people lose their feet?” I usually wind up talking to friends or coworkers for at least a half an hour, answering their questions and explaining how it works.  

I know this isn’t particularly common (or at least it doesn’t seem that way, with all the posts on this subreddit), but I just wanted to share my experience, because there *are* people who are interested in educating themselves, instead of just assuming. Do you have any similar experiences?

My diet has changed. I'm feeling more mentally alert, and I've become a lot more active than I ever have been before. 

One thing that's been bugging me since I started on insulin, that I'd hoped was an initial symptom of running high blood sugar for so long, is very poor short term memory. 

Is this a common side effect for newly diagnosed?, has anyone had any experience  of this, and if so did your memory improve, and if so how long did it take?

It's the most annoying downside to Diabetes for me at the moment, sisnce I DO feel so much mentally alert, I just can;t seem to remember things. I can literally be told something and a few seconds later I will struggle to remember what it was that was just said to me. 

I notice this the most at work, and it's impacting my delivery. I've picked up a stigma for poor memory now and its annoying, because it's not who I am.

Recently I've been experiencing extreme fatigue (sleeping 12-14 hours when I'm not at work and napping during my lunch hour), pain where my kidneys, inability to concentrate, frequent urination, and a pain during urination that comes and goes (some days it does hurt others it doesn't).  

I went to one doctor, who was my primary care physician, and was completely useless.  He wouldn't even listen to me, all he did was run a test for urine/blood, and said he might put me on an ACE inhibitor.  The last time I had been to the doctor was a year ago, and they found a protein leak in my urine then and even more now.  I went to another doctor to rule out an STD, as the symptoms were similar, and came back clean.  Yeh for that at least!

I guess I should state what's being on in my life the past year.  I was a diabulimic for about a year or so, and came out of it about 2 months ago.  I used it to lose weight obviously (roughly 45-50lbs.), but I have found healthier alternatives to fighting my depression.  I still have a horrible time with binge eating, but I at least compensate it with HumaLog injections.  Now I'm taking care of myself the best I know how, but I'm worried that I may have diabetic nephropathy as I'm exhibiting all the symptoms, aside from edema and itchiness.  Has any one else had or know someone who has had nephropathy?  And if so, how did you feel prior to diagnosis?  

I'm getting really scared, because in the past, I didn't really want to live, but I do now, and am trying to undo what has already been done.  I've got an endocrinologist appointment next week, but if I have to go on several medications or dialysis, I'm not so sure I will, because if it's this bad at 25, I can't imagine how much poorer my quality of life will be at 30, 35, so on.  Obviously, it's already pretty low, so I can't see myself wanting to live a life where it's much lower.  I would probably just let nature takes it course.

He has ""trauma-induced"" diabetes caused by a car accident; they believe his pancreas still functions at 10-15% of normal but it seems to fluctuate. For all practical purposes, he's type 1. He was diagnosed during college and is now 28, so he's had a few years of practice but unfortunately missed out on the typical parent caretaking that most type 1's learn from. 

Due to bare bones insurance (and apathy on his part), he's had some terrible doctors, terrible advice, and terrible care. We weren't dating when he was first diagnosed, so I don't know all the details, but at one point a doctor told him ""oh, well, check once or twice a day and as long as your sugars are below 250 it's not a big deal"". Combined with a typical southern diet and college student apathy towards long-term health, his diabetes was very poorly controlled for many years. Because he's not a new diabetic, doctors don't automatically give him the normal ""how to take care of yourself"" information (and he doesn't ask questions). 

We've been dating 3 years, essentially live together (he has a separate apartment to appease his parents), and considering marriage in the semi-near future. I have many diabetic relatives and seem to be more knowledgeable than him about it. I started taking a more active role this past year, and slowly prodding him along towards change. He finally saw a good endocrinologist in January, switched from syringes to insulin pens which made a HUGE difference. He was super happy, the pens were a new toy, and he was very good about checking sugars and injecting insulin for meals. That went on for about 2 months and his A1C was fantastically better, then he seemingly went ""oh, all better now! Yay, no more diabetes worries!"". For about 2 months, he stopped checking before meals, often forgot to inject insulin, and so forth (when I reminded him to check sugars, he was often in the 300+ range). He snapped out of it, got back on the right track for a bit, and is now back to apathy. We moved to a new city, 6 weeks ago, and he is yet to find a new doctor.

I'm stuck. I force him to do anything, but I can't stand by and watch him slowly kill himself. My Grandmother became a widow in her 50's due to my grandfather's poorly controlled diabetes. He never saw his youngest child graduate college, never walked his daughters down the aisle to be married, never met any of his grandchildren. I know that diabetes care, even the basics my boyfriend has, is a world of difference from the olden days, but he is setting himself up for very serious consequences in the future. Every time he starts to settle into a good routine, he slides backwards. 

I know it's easy for me to tell him what to do; I'm not the one pricking my finger constantly or giving multiple shots. But I do try to eat the same diet as him, find tasty diabetes friendly recipes, pack him a darn good lunch, exercise with him, ect. I've even tried bribing him with um...special favors. But if I push too hard, he (understandably) gets annoyed and feels smothered. He just doesn't see diabetes as a big problem. 

Currently I handle meals and snacks at home (I enjoy cooking, so it's not a problem for either of us), remind him to check sugars at meals, help when I notice he's low (I carry juice boxes in my purse...certainly doesn't help the feeling that I've become his mother), sometimes make a suggestion at meals out, and try to take supportive but not overbearing role. But part of me wants to just smack him, take complete control over his food, insulin, doctor appointments, schedule, ect. until he snaps out of this. We live in the deep south (America), surrounded by obesity and type 2 diabetes, so any community events/education are basically ""put down the cookie and take a walk"" and not helpful at all for him.

What's a good middle ground?

1372182021.0	1h1t8t	Since three...Never really cared. Help.	ddbm135	18	3	66	"I was diagnosed when I was three years old. So, the whole diabetes thing is all too familiar.

I have never been a good diabetic. When I was young I would sneak candy and bad food all the time. I even got creative...I would stick a spoon in peanut butter and then dip it in refined sugar. Yeh. Judge me because it is justified. Getting caught was somewhat common, especially when my mother would find clumps of peanut butter in her morning tea after using the tainted sugar cup.

Fast forward 25 years. I am now 28. Relatively healthy. I exercise and eat nutritiously...most of the time. My fiance is a big help especially with the food/diet aspect. I stay away from carbs as much as possible. I don't really drink diet sodas (although, I am at this very moment). I stick to natural sugars and such, just in moderation because I do not trust artificial sweeteners aside from Stevia which isn't always available.

However, aside from this, I am a very bad diabetic. Aside from the occasional cheating that we diabetics all do (don't deny it), I have other bad habits and lack of good habits. 

I never test my blood sugar. I have an insulin pump and I just bolus random numbers. My a1c isn't good, average around 9. I once had a CGM, but it broke and the company would not replace it despite endless communication and my insurance company (medicaid) will not cover ""durable medical equipment"" aka insulin pump supplies and CGMs. I buy my pump supplies online for a pretty hefty price.

I will go to an appointment with an endocrinologist. Lie about my numbers to the extent that I will even fabricate a spreadsheet of made-up numbers and tell them my glucose monitor is in the car or some other BS. I will leave the appointment determined to do better. That ambition will last for about a week and then the ""f*** it"" mentality takes over. My fiance has tried to help, but I become incredibly sensitive and defensive when she asks things like ""When did you last check your blood sugar?"" and then she stops asking. Again, she still helps me with my diet when she is around, but as soon as she is away or whatever, I usually cheat...a lot.

I know, I know...it is my health. I need to take control. It is up to me. These habits are going to have terrible complications. Blah, blah, blah. I don't mean to sound insensitive, but I have heard all of this before x1000. I recall when I was a child that my father took me to a grave where a family member died because she did not take care of her diabetes. It had very little impact on me. It could be because he (father) developed diabetes, too from not taking care of himself, so I just see him as a hypocrite.

I really want to live a long and healthy life. I enjoy traveling and outdoor activities and other things which require good health, but it seems like an endless cycle of ""I need to change, I will change, I am doing good, f*** it"". Rinse and repeat.

1369880472.0	1fb7pl	15 year old daughter not taking diabetes seriously... Advice please!	cokomo	22	6	58	"My step-daughter who is 15 was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes this past November. She is taking insulin to control it. We are having a really hard time trying to get her to take this seriously. She frequently forgets to check her blood sugar and count her carbs in order to take the correct insulin dosage. She also lies about her blood sugars.

We go to diabetes education at least once per month. She also sees her endocrinologist once a month. She has heard everything that can happen to her if she does not take care of herself. 

When she has a high or low blood sugar, her dad and/or I will ask her what she ate, how many carbs she accounted for and how many units of insulin she took. She usually says she can't remember or she thinks she ate this and she thinks she took this many units. We usually never get an honest answer. We have even asked her to keep track by writing everything down in a notebook we bought her for this purpose or take a note on her phone. Of course this doesn't happen because she forgets that too.

I understand that her being diagnosed at 15 can't be easy for her and her dad and I are mindful of that, but this is getting ridiculous. She is constantly getting into fights with her dad because she has an ""I don't care"" attitude or she just wants to be like her friends and not have to worry about checking blood sugars or taking insulin. 

We have discussed this with her doctors and all they really say is that she needs to take care of herself. There are only two other girls in her school that have type 1 diabetes, but they were diagnosed when they were a lot younger.

 I am so tired of her lying and picking fights with us when we are only trying to help her. We really are trying to be supportive and not get on to her about every little thing, but we can't continue to let her get away with not taking care of herself properly. Her blood sugars have been in the high 300s and even in the 500s at times. It's usually only under control when she is at home and we are counting her carbs and calculating her coverage to determine her insulin dosage for her.

So, basically what I'm asking for is advice. Has anyone here had any experience in this situation? I would appreciate any advice. Thanks in advance."	t5_2qhsj	True

I took a ride up to her family's house to hang out with her for the day along with a few other friends. I'm happy to say she was doing so much better - it was almost unbelievable the change in attitude. She says the mornings are still the worst, but after a little while she perks up and is positive. She's amazingly strong - I suppose you all are for taking the diagnosis and still kicking life's ass! She even begged us to bring her some of her favorite vegan pizza which we did. I got some shit for it from people I talked to about Type 1 for giving it to her, but she wanted it and no way was I gonna deny her. She took her meal insulin and she looked so pumped to be eating the pizza. 

Anyways, I ordered a couple of the books you all suggested in that thread and plan to send them to her. I also sent her some of the blogs suggested in your comments and I think she's going to try to get into the blogging game herself. Also trying to get a better grasp of Type 1 as well so I can better support for her if she needs it. So thanks, /r/diabetes !

I am an R&amp;D engineer for one of the largest pump companies in the world (for regulatory reasons I really cannot say which one, but the mods gave me the green light to post).

A little bit of my background - I have my BS and MS in Biomedical Engineering with an emphases in device engineering and bioengineering. I've been working on the R&amp;D side of insulin delivery for 3 years now and have had prior experiences in imaging technology, surgical tools, and biologics.

I'm just going to layout some ground rules before we start...

Things I **CANNOT/NOT ALLOWED TO** do:

* Not give medical advice - just like it says, ""If you're asking whether you should see a doctor, the answer is **YES** go see a doctor!""
* Not here to sell pumps - I'm here to spread some knowledge/information =)
* Not here to troubleshoot pumps - if you're having problems please contact your associated help line
* Not violate EU and FDA marketing regulations - if I feel like your question would do so I'll do my best to answer it, but please forgive me if I'm not straightforward with you. 
*Not violate company policies and divulge IP - I kind of like my job, would prefer not to lose it =P.

Things I'm here to do:

* Answer general technology questions
* Answer questions about the current and future technology pathways of pumps specifically (we can delve into other tech aspects of diabetes care and treatment, but it's not my expertise)
* Where the industry (Insulin delivery and CGM) and research is heading
* Where diabetes treatment is heading in the near and long term future (MDI v pumping v closed loop v tissue engineering v genetic engineering)
* Answer any other questions I can
* To learn from you!

Really looking forward to having a discussion with many of you - I'll do my best to be timely in my responses =)

Edit: Just wanted to follow up and say thank you all for the most excellent questions! I did my best to answer as best as possible while following my own ground rules. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. If anybody ever has more questions or just wants to discuss diabetes tech, don't hesitate to shoot me a message or post here - I will make it a point to respond to as many, if not all, questions/comments/messages.

Speaking (extrapolated BG as I did not stop to test) - 250, sweating, speaking quickly, want to say everything but also want to get the f out of this situation

Walking back (extrapolated BG) - 180, aw damn, I meant to say x, y, and z... oh well, too late now... stress is currently and rapidly being alleviated

I'm overweight.  The people in my life tell me I'm not but I am, and I'm obsessed with trying to get it off.  I'm also Type 1.  Every time I look at myself or lean over I feel all the fat in my gut and it makes me feel useless and disgusting.  I'm not really fat anywhere else except my stomach, and I hate it, and thus, I hate myself.   I know I need better self-image, but I can't control anything in my life (diabetes included) and it just makes me further depressed.

I lost weight a year ago by not taking insulin and eating excessively.  I felt horrible physically, but I was finally at a weight I was happy with, and I'm considering doing it again.  Insulin gets stored as fat, so I feel like I'm never going to be able to get it off while using insulin.  I know how it made me feel....like death's hand was on me, but I just don't care anymore.  My life is empty, and if I feel like if this is what I have to look forward to for the next 10-20-30+ years, than I mind as well just kill myself now.  I know that's awful to say, and I know it makes you guys sad to hear it too, but I don't have any friends that understand what being Type I is like, nor do they have weight/image/self-worth issues like I have.

I've been diabetic for almost 16 years now, and for the most part, I'm a pretty upbeat guy.  I have ups and downs in life like everyone else, but I've never known (or even met) another T1 diabetic in real life.  It'd be nice to have something in common with someone so they know what I go through on a daily basis, because people who don't have it can only know so much.  I know there are a lot of others out there, but I've never known anyone else to have it, so it's pretty isolating.

What are some of you all's experience with other T1 in your peer group?  Everyone assumes that I got diabetes because I used to be fat, but not a lot of people know there are two types.  I've seen support groups, but they are either for children with T1, or old folks with T2, neither of which would suit me very well.

Also, I've been told by a female that I'm being kept alive artificially (years ago now, but its stuck with me since), which is true, but I've never been able to comfortably tell women that I'm T1 (I'm kinda a former/soon-to-be-former foreveralone type, but I'm overcoming it).  I sometimes feel like god is telling me not to have children, because women (and men for that matter) don't want sick children, but I would be a great father I think...

Sorry for rambling.  Any suggestions advice you guys can give me is greatly appreciated!

Edit:  Wow!  Thanks for all the responses everyone.  It helps knowing that there are others out there who are like me."	t5_2qhsj	True

Sunday was my sensor change day and I kept getting sensor failures, after each one I called dexcom tech support and they said they would send out a new one. I thought maybe it was a bad lot - all the failures were from the same lot number - finally I got one to send a signal and the final time I called tech support he questioned my transmitter and that it may be old. Then today I got a sudden intense pain at my sensor site, I rubbed it for a minute waiting for it to pass but it just got worse and there was a smell of something burning, my coworkers even asked if there was plastic burning. I quickly ripped out the sensor and took off the transmitter, it was VERY hot to the touch. I called Dexcom and they are having me return the transmitter and send pictures of the sensor site (it looks messed up, very red and the hole where the sensor was is black). They did not offer to replace it, and I am NOT putting it back on my body. I have ordered a new transmitter since I'm not sure how to live without a dexcom anymore. SO, that sucks!!!!!	t5_2qhsj	True

When my blood sugars are between 4 and 6, she forces me to eat something even when I'm not hungry and have no reason to, because she doesn't understand that I won't necessarily go low from this. When my bloods are over 7, she tells me how I'm not looking after myself and how I'm immature and careless. When I go low, she tells me it's my own fault for, as she calls it, 'getting bolus happy'. When I'm changing my pump, she tells me how I'm doing it wrong, despite the fact that she does not know how to do it at all.

I'm 28 and I've been diagnosed with either t1.5 or t2 for the last 6 years. I was diagnosed while leaving the army, and through their system I've been passed around and basically told 10 different things, told to test, told not too, told to eat better, exercise and then was ignored. My family has a history of type 1, but I never had high blood sugar until the end of my 4 years with the army. Since trying  (eating testing and weight loss and pills) for a year, completely doing it right and dealing with idiot army doctors, I fell off the wagon. Got mad and left it as what I thought it was. A life crippling death sentence. I was used to eating anything anytime. I loved trying all kinds of foods in excess. I was around guys who didn't have this issue all the time. I thought ""why me"" and was mad and just decided to not deal with it. Its now time to pay the piper. 
      
After letting it go for 6 years now I now have a slight issue with sight, my legs are sore everyday and aren't healing normally. I'm depressed, have no energy, cant get it up, and pretty much have no motivation and am a lazy piece of shit.

 I feel like me ignoring this has ruined me . My poor wife, who's a resident, has a husband that she can't get to do anything about it is begging me to take care of myself. My daughter,as I cry right now while typing this, probably wont have a father for the better part of her life and deserves much more from me. I always say I'm going to take care of it, but I feel like the sugar runs my life.  I feel like its something that just makes me lazy and demoralizes me. I used to be very energetic. I had to be the Army and was for the year after I got out. After that I just got tired of feeling alone about it, no one knowing and no one caring. I felt like ""Ok live fast and die younger I guess"". I was an idiot.

Today I'm going to see one of my wife's colleagues, who I know, who can hopefully set me on the right track. I do have questions though that I don't think he'll be able to answer as well as some of you all though. 

First off, has anyone come from my point of view? How are you now? How did you give yourself the kick in the ass( I feel as if this it what it would take for me)? 
I want to stop feeling sorry for myself. I want to blame the sugar for that. Should I? or should I seek some help or just really try to get over it. 

Is it to late for my legs? I feel like if I get a major cut/bruise or break I fear it could be it for that leg. 

Do you feel depressed when your sugar is high? 

How did you change your lifestyle?

How do people deal with starting working out after not taking care of themselves? I'm reeling with pain and soreness after a mild workout. 

I feel as almost if I'm addicted to carbs... Anyone else feel like that?

Are any of my issues red flags for something else that any of you have had?

I'm going to be asking these things to the doc today also but would really like to see what you guys have to say about it.

Thanks in advance for at least reading/commenting if you have.

As of right now, I am checking my blood glucose: when I wake up, before food, sometimes in between food, and before I go to sleep. My medications for now are: Humalog, and Lantus. So far, it really isn't that bad, at most I would call it an annoyance. I would love to hear your guys information, I want to learn as much as possible, thanks.	t5_2qhsj	True

ExcaliburBo	14	0	14	"I'm 20 years old and have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for almost three years now and been gluten-intolerant for about as long.

However, everyday life for me will most definitely be a lot different in China and that's why I'm asking you guys. Perhaps r/diabetes has subscribers in China? If so, how do you cope with it?

I was diagnosed in February in Afghanistan. Since then I've been subject to a Physical Evaluation Board. The board results have come back. I've been recommended for retirement. I don't get to finish my career the way I wanted to, but I'm young. I can start a new career. 

Since I was notified that I would have to appear before the PEB, I have told myself that healthcare was the only thing I needed. I've been offered dirt cheap healthcare for life and a ridiculously generous VA disability rating.

==========
What is Detective Diabetes?

Detective Diabetes is an iPad / iPhone adventure game which features a main character who has diabetes.  Throughout the course of the game the user makes decisions which, over the short term, influence glucose levels and, over the long term, increase or decrease the likelihood of diabetes-related complications.  The game’s scenarios are based on dozens of interviews with people who have diabetes.  

The main goals of the game are to: (1) increase empathy for people who have diabetes and (2) demonstrate that short term actions can greatly reduce the long term effects of diabetes.

The game will launch late this year or early next year. We expect the game to be downloaded and played by hundreds of thousands of people. 

The game is self-funded by the seven person team developing the game.

He had never had symptoms before, and coincidentally, he'd had his blood sugar checked in April and it was completely normal. Yesterday he went to the doctor and his blood glucose was in the 390s. Our doctor says it's type 2 despite the extremely sudden onset of symptoms (extreme thirst, constant peeing, malaise, nausea, fatigue, chills, 22 lb weight loss in one month). Anyway, the doctor claims it's not type 1, but can come up with no reason why his symptoms were so sudden. Anyone have any insight?

He was given metformin but has  not taken it yet. He wanted to see how abstaining from carbs and adding exercise would change his levels. He did drop in 24 hours from 397 to 336, but I'm pretty worried about him not taking the metformin with levels that high. He's very anti-drug and wants to see if he can drop the sugar with lifestyle change alone. Should I be worried or let him do his thing? 

Thanks! 

**update: he was extremely nauseous this morning, and with ketone sticks telling us his ketone levels were very high, I took him to the ER. He is in DKA. They're keeping him overnight at least. I'm not sure what this means yet, but thanks for the advice, everyone.**"	t5_2qhsj	True

When I started my job, it was my parents' advice to let my company know that I have Type 1 diabetes, just incase I pass out due to hypoglycemia on the job, someone would be aware and know what to do. I wasn't aware that this was going to backfire. 

My superior has made multiple comments to me about making jokes in the office, not inappropriate jokes, just puns, always office related. A few times now, he's said something to the liking of, ""ThrownOutNotAway, is your blood sugar low? You might want to check that."" Not only was this a joke based on a disability, but it was completely uncalled for and professional. 

I went to HR to report this, but they basically swept it under the rug. They also mentioned I have no legal recourse. Is this true?

This guy is a complete jerk. His lack of communication skills and the hypocrisy in the work place has caused my blood sugar to go crazy. One day my blood sugar will be low, and the next day I'll be in the 300s because I'm stressed out. My hair started falling out a few days ago due to the stress that this asshole has put me under for the last few months. 

What I want to know is that if I quit, I can file under hostile work environment. Working in this environment is literally causing my health to deteriorate. I don't know what to do, Reddit. Please help me.

My bf has had type 1 since he was 6 years old, he's now 28. From what I can see he manages it really well and has only really had one bad hypo in that time shortly after he was diagnosed.  He's very open about injecting (he has pens) and testing his blood whilst we're out and about and I really don't mind this either.  We used to be just friends but as I'm spending a hell of a lot more time with him over the past few months (and in future!) I'd like to educate myself more.

I have told him what to do if I have an asthma attack and I'd like to know similar about his diabetes.  He's said he rarely gets bad but I've noticed he can get moody sometimes if he's high/low and he's pretty protective about his management and has a terribly bad sweet tooth. He sometimes has to get up during the night and gets a bit shakey.  He gets very sleepy at times during the daytime too.

I also think I should know what to do if something bad did happen as a 'just in case scenario'.  I've heard if he gets too drunk it could cause problems.  It concerns me how much chocolate and sweet things he eats too. Am I worrying necessarily?  Basically I don't want to be a nag, but I love him and want to support him too.

I've been dealing with a diagnosis of Type 1 for 2 months now, and on the whole I've been managing very well. My blood sugar is averaging 5-6mmol, I've switched diets and have started to exercise regularily. 

I've been really proud of myself, but I've recently start to feel resentment and empty. Like I've been robbed of the freedom that I enjoy most in life, the flippancy and choice. 

I feeling like a little boat in a big ocean, and keep getting the urge to just walk and keep going. 

I know this is probably normal feelings for inital diagnosis (T1) but work is really just grinding me down. My head is elsewhere and I'm resenting that I'm trapped 9-5 more than usual, and not being able to experience more in life. This probably has a lot of roots in the way I feel limited now and how. 

My question is whether any of this community needed time off work to 'stabalise'. I didn't take a day, other than for appointments and my DAFNE course, I got a lot of questions answered but I'm still at odds with the changes that I'm going through. I'm starting to think I've made a mistake. I'm not an emotional guy, maybe I didn't credit myself enough that this would effect me, I don't know, work would find it hard if I wasn't around being part of a small team, should I consider this and just man up, or did time off really help any of you?

This ended up being a lot longer than I thought it would be...

I had been working out in the sun all day, and hadn't been testing, but I had been eating what I *thought* would be enough, but as you may guess, it wasn't.  

Got back to the truck, and tested in the upper 70's.  I thought ""no problem,"" and I popped a few jolly ranchers.  Just as we are about to make the 2.5 hour drive home, I threw up EVERYHERE right after having a none-too-pleasant poops.  

Not that much of a worry, I'll just have some chips and more jolly ranchers, only they were making me more sick.  We make it about 30 minutes, and I haven't been able to eat much, and my sugar is down to 64.

Pull over to a (thankfully) close convenience store in the middle of the desert, where I throw up again in a stall that I barged in to where a father was laying tp over the toilet seat for his little girl to go to the bathroom in.

We locked eyes for a brief second, me barely holding back the upchuck with my hand, and I dove for the seat, gargling what I hope sounded like ""sorry.""

After that ordeal, I was able to down most of a regular coke, and we sat at the gas station in case I was going to get sick again (you know, backtrack to the closest hospital), but I felt better, and the trek home continued.

I do OK all the way back to the office, and then after a 14 hour day, and needing to get up in 8 hours to do another one of them, I decided that I really should get this checked out, so I went to the ER.

ER docs and nurses take all the tests, and do all the things, then the cutest nurse I have ever seen saunters in to my room and hands me a ""hat"" as she called it.  It goes in a toilet to collect your ""specimen.""

She then leaves the room, and as she it leaving, looks back at me and smiles coyly.  Seriously nurse?  I have to give you my horrible, sick, poop.

I do my business, and go to find her, brimming with confidence at the line I have waiting.

*Voice wavering unexpectedly*
""I h-hope that's enough?""

Shit.
Shit shit shit shit.

I turn and shuffle back to my room, gown waving unceremoniously open behind me.

The cherry however, is when she came back 30 minutes later and said that it indeed wasn't enough.  She needed more.

TL:DR
Asked a really pretty nurse ""I h-hope that's enough?"" when referencing the putrid, sick shit she had to go and collect."	t5_2qhsj	True

[First challenge](http://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/p5i7y/introducing_the_rdiabetes_challenge_a_collective/) and  [Second challenge](http://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/u34js/introducing_the_june_2012_rdiabetes_challenge_v20/)
on here.



***

 I realized that I have just over 80 days until my next Dr. appointment, and really need to get into shape.
I thought that this would be good motivation to get myself in shape, and if you're reading this far, maybe you're interested too.

I also realized that we haven't had a challenge here in about 9 months, so I think it's time for a new one.


* Are you lacking in BG control?
* Are you lacking in willpower to improve?
* Do you need positive reinforcement?
* Do you need a new group of friends that are diabetically aware, and know how to help you meet your goals?


**The Challenge Goals**

* Better understanding of Diabetes
* Better understanding of how foods and their macros work, for normal people, and for all different types of diabetics
* Better awareness of your BGs, tighter control
* Better diet/exercise and how it affects you.
* Better data tracking, allowing you to see the big picture.
* Improved communication on the subreddit, maybe more people coming to the [IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23reddit-diabetes).


**How are we going to meet these goals?**

We need to hold each other accountable. This means sharing things like MFP Food diaries and exercise. 
I realize that not everyone has a smartphone to do live tracking, but it's incredibly easy to log
these things after the activity.

I will be sharing my MFP food and exercise diary, and will be asking for you to critique it, marvel at it, and yell at me for it when I've headed down a carby road. 

http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/diary/computercarl

I also use mapmyrun http://www.mapmyfitness.com/profile/16288837/

Fibit: https://www.fitbit.com/user/233PC3

and Just purchased ZombiesRun https://www.zombiesrungame.com/computercarl/

I also have an imgur account @ http://computercarl.imgur.com/all/ where I host my weight loss pics and some CGM data. It's this kind of sharing that I hope to use to add some friends here and get/give positive support and feedback.



I realized that 80 days is a lot, so I'll also consider breaking it in half, 40 days to do your best to meet
all of the goals, and then use the remaining 40 days continue to the habits made during the first half. If you do something long enough, it just becomes second nature.

We already have a few people who are on board with the challenge --  SeanBateman7, Parabola, Tank and myself included -- so this is definitely going to happen. Even if no one else accepts the challenge, I will be doing it.
So... will ***you*** join us in the effort aimed towards better diabetes care and a healthier, happier life?

Please upvote this so more people can see it. I receive no karma since this is a self-post.

I'm working on arranging a custom flair for V3 participants. I'm thinking a purple flair, as with all this testing, your fingers will be that color.

I will not be posting an overall update at the end of this, I'm really making it to open the subreddit for better overall communication and interaction.

**edit I also hang out in ##loseit on IRC, and have invited them to join. They can do all of the exercise and logging things, and be supportive of others in that capacity.


**TL;DR: I challenge you to make minor improvements in your diabetes care for either 40 or 80 days.** "	t5_2qhsj	True

My new A1c is 6.8%, which is up from 6.3% last time it was taken. 

It's not a bad number, but the direction it's moving is not one I'm very happy with. A few things I know that are factoring into the number; my diet has been lax. I've been breaking my rule and eating things like bread and pasta and processed sugars. It's not good, and I need to get back to my diet where I do not eat those things. Another thing is school. This semester is taking a toll on me emotionally and mentally. The stress of smashing myself against my studies is no doubt having an impact on my numbers. That I spend most of my time studying also means that I haven't had time to exercise as much as I'd like to. 

Anyway I just thought I'd share what's going on in my life with you guys. Hopefully I can step my game up and take back control over my diabetes, diet, and school work. Thanks for reading. "	t5_2qhsj	True

Well, 4 weeks in my blood glucose reads around 6.5 mmo/l every morning. I know I'm not quite done yet reversing my diabetes, but I find the transformation incredible (I also lost 10 lbs in the process).

I did it by simply adopting a ketogenic diet high in fat (65%), adequate in protein (30%), and low in carbs (5%). I eat less than 25 grams of net carbs per day (Total carbohydrates - fiber).

I had one of the best dates I've had in a long time last night. Awesome girl, lot in common, beautiful, smart, chemistry, we shared a bunch of kisses, etc.

Went to bed at 1ish am, following 2 drinks of liquor and a beer with an amazing woman I met through a coworker. Checked my sugar when I got home—significantly elevated @ 200 mg/dl. Took a unit to correct to 160 mg/dl (I have a very aggressive basal rate so this actually lets me wake up with a good fasting number).

Currently 4:09am.

Body, luckily, woke me up with my lowest recorded sugar ever—*37*. I've never been this low. I feel so lucky to be alive as I type these words. What if I suffered from hypoglycemic unawareness? What if didn't (well, I don't, yet), but I just ignored the signs and didn't wake up at all? I would have had this blissful experience and no opportunity to follow up on it. I would have destroyed my family. I'm the rock—the glue that holds everyone together. Damn!

Not even sure what the ultimate goal of this post is. Probably that life is fleeting, and t1d makes it even more so.

**Customer Service**

I want to reiterate my happiness with Tandem's customer service - I've now spoken with 4 different people (and emailed back and forth 3 of them). Each has been unbelievably helpful. They did offer in-person training but since I've been using a pump for 12yrs and I write computer software for a living I decided that I didn't need it. So far I think I made the right call. And, any questions I have I email into Andrew and he responds very quickly and with real and helpful answers - I've yet to receive a business-y-bullshit answer to any of my questions. One time Andrew took ~12hrs to respond to me and made a point to apologize - I thought that was cute (right, so *cute* isn't really a manly word but it's what I chose to go with....)

**Supplies**

I've ordered one refill of infusion sets and the process really couldn't have been easier - I just called up, asked for the kind I wanted, requested it be scheduled for every three months, and was done (I chose the Cleo 90, haven't received yet so I don't have a review of those). During the call they suggested three boxes but when I expressed worry about running out they immediately suggested upping it to 4 boxes. My insurance covers durable medical supplies (including the pump) at 100% so I didn't worry about the cost - this may not apply to everyone. My only complaint is that Tandem marked the shipment as requiring an in-person signature meaning someone has to be home to receive the package. After UPS attempted to deliver twice I called Tandem and asked them to put a flag on my account to never require signature for supplies - they did that without batting an eye. Once again, they were willing to bend over backwards to make me happy.

**The Pump - Basics**

The pump is great in many ways and frustrating in a few. It's smaller than my old Paradigm 722 both in thickness and length but does weigh slightly more (not enough to care, though). The main button on top unlocks the touch-screen which is colorful and responsive (more details about the touch-screen below - I do have complaints). It has all the features you'd expect from a pump - regular and temp basals, bolus wizard, etc...

The lock screen contains the current battery charge, time/date, insulin in reservoir (even though the reservoir holds 300u the screen maxes at 240 and if &gt;240u are available it says ""+240 u"" - I don't know why it does that. 240 isn't even a power of 2 so it's not like it's some kind of programming datatype thing (yes, that was nerdy, I'm sorry)), and current insulin on board including how long it'll stay on board. If you tap the top-right corner you'll be shown a status screen including current basal rate, last bolus, current carb ratio, etc...

When entering a bolus you can enter direct units **and** BG level - it'll then calculate the correct amount of insulin based on any required correction. If you choose, you can use the carb wizard instead of directly entering units. The calculations always take into account current insulin on board levels and put the calculation out front for you to see - nothing is hidden from you. Also, if you're like me and binge on insulin it'll show alarms if you're using a lot in an hour - you can ignore it of course but I like the reminder of ""dude...wtf...why so much insulin?!""

Basal rates are set inside of Profiles. You can have multiple profiles to fit various activities you do (I'm a lazy, internet addicted, programmer so I have exactly one profile). Each profile is made up of time periods where each time period contains a basal rate, BG correction, carb correction settings, and more. You can, when setting up the profile, duplicate a period. You can also duplicate profiles which allows you to make small changes without having to re-enter every single thing.

**The Pump - Hardware**

The t:slim does have a touchscreen and as such you should be as careful as you would be with your phone. I keep my pump in my left pocket so I don't worry too much about it but I am worried what will happen if I drop it (which I did a non-insignificant number of times with my Paradigm). No screen scratches though.

The reservoir is Tandem's big thing - instead of using a plunger to inject insulin from the reservoir it uses suction to pull insulin from the reservoir and then push it into the tubing. I've found that this leads to faster insulin injection without any discomfort. It also allows the reservoir to be much much smaller (directly leading to the smaller pump size). Although they do not advertise it, it is possible to refill the reservoir.

A full charge lasts a long time. I last charged the pump on Saturday and I have 50% power left. Were I to plug in it would be back at 100% in 30 minutes. Tandem suggests that you charge it each day while you're in the shower to keep a full charge. But, I'm not worried about it. The pump came with a usb charger and both wall and car plugs (to go along with the 30 other wall and car plugs I have). I thought it was very cool of them to include a car plug. So I can plug into a wall, my computer, or my car. Plenty of options and I no longer have to buy AAA batteries. Benefits abound.

**The Pump - Complaints** (yup, I have some)

So, what sucks about the t:slim?

1. I can turn off insulin delivery just like I would do on my Paradigm **but** the pump will audibly alarm after 10min (might be 15min), even if you've turned off or silenced all alarms. I'm told by Andrew that this is a new FDA requirement and all new pumps will have this annoyance. To get around it, though, I just set a temp basal of 0u/hr (fuck you FDA - don't tell me what I can do)

2. If, while tapping around on the screen, you hit a non-actionable part three times then the screen will lock. In other words, if you accidentally press outside of the ""Bolus"" button then the pump will lock itself to protect you from *butt bolusing*. Make sense. The problem, though, is I don't think the counter is reset when I correctly hit an actionable button. For example, if I hit a non-actionable part of the screen twice in a row and then hit an actionable button I would expect the counter to go back to 0. Instead, it seems to stay at 2 and if I hit a non-actionable part of the screen once it'll then lock.

3. If the pump is locked and not illuminated and I hit the home button to illuminate the lock screen then it will turn the screen off after 15 seconds. The problem is that I've set the screen timeout to be 120 seconds. It appears that timeout is not followed when on the lock screen. The timeout does appear to be followed when not on the lock-screen.

4. All priming is pump controlled. Due to the design of the reservoir it is not possible to speed up the priming of your tubing. I use to be able to change my infusion site, fill a reservoir, and get on my way in under 2 minutes. Now it's taking me ~5 minutes - the entire increase is caused by the priming. Also, the priming is loud enough to be annoying.

tl;dr: It has its quirks but I won't go back to my Paradigm. Overall, I am extremely pleased with the pump and Tandem as a whole. I do suggest people switch to it."	t5_2qhsj	True
1347148393.0	zku5k	Stopped using the pump - my life is better	ClydeTjenkins	17	6	28	"3 months ago I discontinued using my medtronic paradigm pump for therapy. My A1C went from 8.9 (in june - fuck) to 7.1 (results attained yesterday). I used the pump for over 8 years. 

Pros:
- It's more of a habit to test sugar --&gt; inject novolog for me. I don't feel injecting willy-nilly. On the pump, I used to give myself units on the fly without testing BG just because I ""felt high"".
- NOTHING IN YOUR POCKET ALL THE TIME
- Get to make some people uncomfortable when you inject in front of them.
- No need for the ridiculously expensive pump supplies.
- ""NO DELIVERY""...not a problem anymore (no mechanical failures).
- Swimming is easier now. Paradigm is not waterproof. 

Cons: 
- Not as easy. More of a process to correct than simply taking a thing out of your pocket and pressing a button. 

This isn't for everyone. It seems like going backwards but for me it is working. If you are having trouble controlling your BG on the pump, please consider switching to long and short acting therapy, or maybe doing a mixed approach (some weeks do pump, some weeks not). Let me know if you ever did this or plan on it! I would be happy to answer any questions.

1346919405.0	zfw2c	I once again encounter incompetence...I am losing all hope here to control my diabetes as I would like to.	ketodiabetic	14	2	54	"Good morning!

This morning I went to see my usual doctor to get my perscriptions for my test strips. He asked how many I use a day and I said on average 10 as I eat several times a day and I live a pretty busy lifestyle, checking this much has brought my A1C levels down to 6.7 which is the lowest I have ever had it.


He told me checking that much isn't necesary, I am only allowed to use maximum 7 strips a day (what if I get a hypo? Or it reads as an error? or if I want to exercise?) he claims I should only use it before and after every meal or if I feel a hypo coming on, I don't need to check it before exercise or if I want to have a snack in the afternoon as ""novorapid is not needed as Lantus will cover you"" Excuse me?! I told him that I WOULD need novorapid if I plan on having some carbs and he insisted that NO I don't because Lantus would cover it, then I said well if Lantus lowers me during the afternoon that would mean I am overdosing on it and eating to compensate the low, or do you think Lantus magically starts working more effectively when I eat carbs? Carbs = glucose!


He told me I have to stick to certain insulin units a day, I am not allowed to have a snack or God forbid eat out somewhere or you know just want to eat ANYTHING out of schedule because it requires more testing, so he expects me to not have insulin if I want to eat a snack because Lantus will cover it...that I don't need to test before eating carbs, that I don't need to test before exercise. I am basically not allowed to live like a normal person, I am only allowed to eat 3 times a day as that is the insulin I am ""programmed"" to use. This man makes no sense. I told him I need to do it the way I am doing it now to avoid complications in the future and in the long run it is better for the public healthcare as they will save money on me from not having any complications if I manage a great control.


He told me an A1C level of 6.7 is ""fantastic"", that I don't need to lower it and that I am obsessing about my diabetes too much. I asked if a pump is eligible he said he hasn't seen any (which I believe, pumps are not common here, I doubt we even have them) and that I don't ""need it"" as I am doing fine with my pens...
So basically he is letting me get ill, I can't afford to go to a private doctor and public healthcare won't do anything because it's the protocol and all doctors have to follow it.
I didn't feel as bounded by my diabetes as I do now."	t5_2qhsj	True
1346328319.0	z2nda	Pregnancy and T1	neatjane	15	1	18	I am interested in T1's who have gone through pregnancy. I am interested in those T1's who were on a pump and who weren't. How much planning did you do and how old you were? I am 32 and looking at children soon. I am not on a pump and tossing up if I should or shouldn't. I am active and swim a lot. I am interested in responses from T1's (or T2's who inject at least 3 times a day), as i feel this will give me the most valuable answers. Thanks!	t5_2qhsj	True

1345668408.0	ynoic	I don't know why some people don't want to admit they know nothing -- a rant about the general public and pumps	Itsrane	14	1	21	"Questions about diabetes and anything else don't annoy me. I'm sure no one is born all-knowing, so when someone approaches me with polite, inquiring questions, I'm usually very accommodating, and try to answer the questions to the best of my knowledge (though I usually stick with my own personal experiences cause I'm not a doctor). 

BUT! I *hate* it when people assume they know more about me than me (warning: strong language ahead). I've had a pump since early 2006. So 6 years. That's 6 years of experience, asshole. What do you have? The title to an article which says that pumps are an alternative to sticking yourself? Don't tell me ""wow, it must be great, you don't have to do anything anymore"" and then talk about your diabetic second cousin or some bullshit in a fucking condescending tone that heavily implies that I'm a lazy fuck. Sticking my fingers 4-6 times a day isn't 'nothing'. Neither is watching every little thing that ends up in my mouth. And are the freak outs that happen when you stick your finger and get a wtf high reading which you can't seem to get down ""nothing""?

So okay, this person is some uneducated plebeian. No need to freak out. But I got that attitude from a dentist while discussing getting my wisdom teeth taken out. ""You wanted to do nothing eh?"" Bitch, doing nothing means death. And ff course I want to have a way to not have to live with this. You think I *prefer* to live this bullshit? And when you have no experience whatsoever with a pump (and that's clear by your idiotic comments), don't assume to tell me that I can't be put under because I'd have to remove my pump. I don't know if I have to remove my pump to undergo surgery (since I've not had any sort of surgery ever *touch wood*), but I think that's something the surgeon AND my endo would decide, not you. 

There's a weird, prevalent attitude that pump users are somehow less than syringe users for... what reason exactly? I found the pump works better for me. Injections worked better for my cousin. There's no better/worse about it.

Whatever, live and let live, and all that. I just needed to rant a bit. "	t5_2qhsj	True
