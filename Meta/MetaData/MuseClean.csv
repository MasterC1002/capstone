Pitchfork writes: 

&gt; In a rather surprising turn of events, Muse is disbanding after almost two full decades of creating music together. The announcement came as a surprise to almost everyone, especially considering the Teignmouth trio have always seemed to be the best of friends. When asked for a statement, Dominic Howard (drummer, percussionist) simply said ""I've had enough of that wanker's bleeps and bloops - he [Matt Bellamy] needs to pick his guitar back up and stop writing lullabies"".  

I...I simply cannot believe it. I'm guessing the rest of the tour will be pretty awkward for everyone, especially Morgan. First TMV disbands, now Muse? Who's next?

I shook Each of their hands, and got my photo taken with them, as well as a signed poster. It was not nearly as cool as I thought, because it was much shorter than the radio station told me it would be. 

But on a cooler note, Matt Bellamy in the middle of a photo starts chowin' down on some chocolate, and says to me ""Fancy some chocolate?""

Well, here's Matt attacking the crowd with his gutar: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BRi0dSFCAAAVWFr.jpg

EDIT: [MATT IN PANIC STATION OUTFIT!!!](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BRi1V-3CcAA8xJp.jpg:small) And actually wtf is [going on here???](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BRi1ZoDCEAAoQo0.jpg:large)

EDIT: [So here's Panic Station :O](http://instagram.com/p/c84pJ3qjJj/#) - I think you can see Tom Kirk with a video camera to the left at the beginning. 

EDIT: See /u/vegetable_offender's [post to see videos and photos](http://www.reddit.com/r/Muse/comments/1k9r21/813_zepp_tokyo_tokyo_japan_tour_thread_setlist/cbmri0v)

______________________________________________________________

WELL, this is quite a lot to take in. Being part of those watching it unfold was bloody exciting nevermind actually being at the gig. I really hope this is practice for the 20th anniversary gigs. This just makes it seem so much more likely. Some things worthy of mention:

1. This is the first time Futurism has been played live since 2000, and it [sounded pretty bad back then](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGEHGTxuFYQ) because Matt couldn't sing it

2. The return of What's He Building In There? by Tom Waits, this time as an encore intro to Panic Station

3. [A giant fucking party on stage](http://instagram.com/p/c85apgv_Dc/#)

4. 6 B-sides played (counting Dead Star, Futurism and Fury)

DLOP32	58	6	21	"Original post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Muse/comments/181box/girlfriend_won_2_tickets_to_see_muse_at_kroqs/

We were told that they would be closing the doors at 3:30pm SHARP! We fought through the LA traffic and just barely made it there at 3:25. After everyone was seated, they pulled in random people off the street to fill the empty spaces left by those who failed to show up. They brought in about 10 lucky bastards. The set only lasted about 30 minutes, but it was an incredible experience to see such an amazing band in such an intimate setting. 

Please allow me to apologize for the quality of the photos and videos. Only phones without flash were allowed to be used, no cameras. Starlight was recorded with my iPhone 4 which has a bad microphone. All the other videos were recorded with my Galaxy SIII.

Before I press play, I'm thinking back on the past year leading up to this. From the announcement, to the trickle of twitter photos, to scouring the internet for any iota of new information about the new tracks.. We only get new Muse every few years, so in the coming days whenever you listen to the album take a moment to remember how excited and impatient you've been for it. I'm ready to welcome these songs into my life, and maybe I'm weird but Muse is really important to me, so it's like welcoming them to the Muse family. These will be songs I'll adore for the rest of my life, and I'll be hearing them now for the very first time. There's no way I'm taking this for granted. 
(also I'm at a [4], but I know there are some of you out there that feel as strongly about music and Muse as I do, so I don't feel too overly fanatic right now haha..)

Edit: I lost count how many times I've listened to the album now. It's so fucking good. Definitely different for Muse, but that's a great thing. I love them all and even the last half of the album (which was mostly brand new for me) is growing on me immensely, despite that weaker grouping of 3-4 songs. "	t5_2qz0k	True

Maybe I'm just being dense and missing the love but I seem to find it's one of those albums where not one track is worth skipping. Even on OoS Darkshines and Screenager come under the 'skippable' tag for me but there's not one single bad song on BH&amp;R in my opinion.

Of course I could just be talking total bollocks but I just wanted to see if it's held in as high esteem as myself. It's not quite as wonderful as Absolution but considering the amount of variety on the album it ticks so many boxes. Even with Soldier's Poem, when you listen to the album from start to finish it comes in the same way Interlude does on Absolution going from the first half to the second. It's like the half time of the album.

Carefully threw together an album and a story of some of Muse's best songs to say goodbye to the Earth.	7revor	56	11	21	"Matt Bellamy loves writing apocalyptic tales of the end of the world, and I am an avid fan of those works. So I decided it would be nice, in light of today's predictions, to put together a... farewell of sorts! I'm not sure about much of this and you guys can alter it as you wish but here's my preference:

1. United States of Eurasia+Col.Damage - Sets the stage for a global ""war"", in which humanity eliminates itself, or simply goes into the original 1984 state of war. I pick this, because it rolls VERY nicely into the next track (**Highly recommend at least trying this combo.**)
2. Apocalypse Please - the world has show that it is going to go to shit and the character just wants it all over with a nice catastrophe.
3. Shrinking Universe - With the line of ""You're the God of a shrinking universe"", I felt this was a nice touch with it's dismal outlook, despite being almost irrelevant.
4. Dead Star - same as #3. It's just a brutal track that should be played to an impacting asteroid... and such.
5. Nishe - The interlude to the hell that is coming, like the character asked for!
6. Megalomania - The organs and the finale make for an amazing disaster of epic proportions.
7. Exogenesis Part 1, Overture - Encompasses how, well... fucked we are. God will have his way with the Earth, per se.
8. Unsustainable - Assures us of our inability to act.
9. Time is Running Out - Our time is running out. Hm.
10. Space Dementia - This could be seen as death, with all the confusion and ""meaningless""ness. I feel this finale should end it all.

So really it's a crudely strewn together list of brutal Muse songs, some with the most fantastic and destructive finales I've ever heard. I'm not so sure about #3 and #4 but I just love those songs and their relative attitude. Isolated System would have fit with the theme but I wanted it to end in an epic fashion, rather than drifting. The other Exogenesis parts tell tales of survival and progression past Earth, but there is no room for hope on this one. I'd watch the world die to this. How about you guys?"	t5_2qz0k	True

I'd like to give a very special thanks to /u/JoelMontgomery and 
/u/matunter for designing this new theme for the subreddit. While /u/matunter provided the banner, /u/JoelMontgomery designed everything else and brought life and color to the sub. 

I hope you all enjoy the redesign, but if you don't, you can always de-select ""Use subreddit style"" on the sidebar, just above the subscribe button. 

Now onto some updated rules for the sub: 

1. This place is intended to be a nice and friendly place to discuss Muse as well as share stories and media about the band. If your post is not about Muse it'll be removed. 

2. Do not, under any circumstances, insult or name call another user. This is very important because quite frankly there's no place for that here. Insults or threats will not be tolerated and if you continue to harass others after a warning has been given you will be banned. Stay positive, we're talking about an awesome band! 

3. Please, for the love of Dom do not keep posting any more of these ""DAE like Muse?"" or ""Am I the only person who likes Plug In Baby?"" posts. There are *always* other people who share your sentiment.

4. Don't distribute their music here illegally. I don't really have to explain this one, right? If you must PM someone I suppose... 

5. Enjoy your stay! Flair up! If you have any questions feel free to ask me here or PM me, I'm on reddit a lot. 

Thanks for reading everyone,

Many of our Brethren are in uproar over hearing dubstep in The 2nd Law trailer.
However, I am pleased to inform those that have not already worked it out, It's not really 'Dubstep' at all. 

Let me explain; Matthew Bellamy famously uses Manson guitars with built in Kaoss pad controllers often seen used being used live in supermassive black hole. Many of his guitars also fitted with Fernandez Sustainer Systems (a circuit in a place of a pickup which continues the magnetic vibration of a string creating infinite sustain). 

Listen again to the 'Dubstep' section, but try to differentiate between the distorted guitar sounds and the kaoss pad sounds. Infact there have been guitar covers of the trailer already! (search for them).

TLDR - It's not Dubstep. It's Bellamy.

I need five questions to hypothetically pose to Matt Bellamy in the form of an official AMA request. The one up there now has some seriously SHITTY questions so I thought I would get the thoughts of r/muse, then get your support in giving it a stimulus package of upvotes once it is posted (so that it may get the attention of the right people)

I'll put up the top five questions as upvoted here

But first some **groundrules:**

1. No interchangeable bullshit musician questions (ie ""what's your favourite song/album to play?"" ""who *inspires* you in your music making?"" etc.)

2. No whining questions (ie ""Why don't you play ______ anymore?"" ""Why do your setlists only play the hits from your early stuff?"" ""Why doesn't the new album sound like Origin of Symmetry?"" etc.)
3. No requesting or asking whether or not Muse is coming to your town (**dear god I hate when people do that**)

4. Thoughtful, unique, and most importantly, thought provoking questions that are not offensive or easily answerable by asking a superfan/searching MuseWiki

Please begin, and let us hope our efforts reach the ears of the great Muse.

**EDIT:** I think that you guys have some good ideas here about making it not just Matt. I think It would be best if we said any or all members of Muse. I tweeted Chris as per the note that he is most active.

1343840449.0	xii6l	[NEW!] Track by track descriptions of The 2nd Law from a French interview	g0newick3d	43	5	13	"A few days ago, we had the opportunity to hear one of hard rock’s most anticipated albums, perhaps the most anticipated album of the year. Check out our first listen to The 2nd Law, the sixth studio album by Muse, which will become available on September 17.

1. Supremacy (4:55)

The 2nd Law opens with a song whose title sounds familiar (you would think that Muse would have at least one or two songs that contain the word “supremacy,” but apparently not…). There’s no real structure. “Supremacy” recalls Led Zeppelin’s “Kashmir” in both riff and orchestration.

2. Madness (4:39)

While it seemed they had launched a machine, Muse takes the listener against their expectations with “Madness,” a calm, sweet and languid song that is surprising to find so early in the tracklist. Electro arrangements are obviously drawing from Depeche Mode, similar to Undisclosed Desires from The Resistance.

3. Panic Station (3:03)

The pace changes again with Panic station, and its bass derived from Red Hot Chili Peppers. In both funk and disco (Muse dared brass), this song has power to be a single. It would be unsurprising to hear it on the radio in a few months.

4. Prelude (1:03)

“Prelude” is none other than the introduction to Survival, the official anthem of the London 2012 Olympics that Muse unveiled off the canvas in June.

5. Survival (4:17)

It’s hard not to think of Queen while listening to “Survival.” From the intro, the ghost of Freddie Mercury hangs over the piece which transitions easily after the first three titles. However, will it become a classic like “Plug In Baby,” “Time Is running Out,” and “Supermassive Black Hole?”

6. Follow Me (3:51)

We continue to “Follow Me,” a title that crescendos after starting with light keyboard accompanying a light voice that sounds like an echo, to finish with a dance floor driven buzz. This track is confusing.

7. Animals (4:23)

“Animals” begins with a rather fast tempo introduced by a barrage of riffs, which never happens. The piece, which recalls Radiohead, races slightly with a quite short guitar solo. We feel it keeps the horses reigned in. It’s the damp squib of the album.

8. Explorers (5:48)

The signature voice of Matt Bellamy hits the nail on the entry to “Explorers,” a ballad along the vein of “Blackout.” ‘Can you free me from the world?’ Matthew sings on this track, which turns out to be the least surprising of the disc.

9. Big Freeze (4:41)

Confusing, ”Big Freeze” is the contrast! Just like “Panic Station,” this title goes beyond the usual and engages clearly with funk. The result is stunning! Nevertheless, it sounds distinctly of Muse and could be a single.

10. Save Me (5:09)

The break of the album comes with “Save Me,” on which Matt Bellamy leaves the microphone to bassist Chris Wolstenholme. The transition is somewhat confusing because the voices of the two musicians are totally different. Chris’ voice is lower than his colleague’s.

11. Liquid State (3:03)

Liquid State is the second track composed by Chris Wolstenholme, and is undoubtedly the most rock of The 2nd Law. Chris’ voice is reminiscent of Maynard James Keenan, the lead singer of Tool, at times.

12. The 2nd Law: Unsustainable (3:48)

As like The Resistance, The 2nd Law closes with a song in parts. The first, entitled ""The 2nd Law: Unsustainable"" is already known to all, as this is the teaser that has caused so much ink since it went online. It is the only track influenced by dubstep. The English group likes to play with the media, who have seen fit to leak an entire disk too quickly, influenced by the latest electronic music trend in fashion.

13. The 2nd Law: Isolated System (4:59)

The second part of the song, “Isolated System,” begins quietly before adopting on a more sustained pace. Here, the keyboards take the lion’s share. The song ends with a female voice in a loop.

1349035702.0	10q31v	9/30 iTUNES FESTIVAL TOUR THREAD [LIVE STREAM, SETLIST, MEDIA, DISCUSSION]	ParanoidAndroids	35	1	89	"Hello everyone, if you didn't know the iTunes Festival is live streaming Muse's performance RIGHT NOW. Go to iTunes and on the front page you should see a link to go to the performance. 

**Note:** You need an Apple ID to stream on iTunes. [Here's a stream that doesn't require an ID.](http://new.livestream.com/accounts/1277955/events/1584734)

**[Setlist]**

1. Supremacy

2. Map of the Problematique

3. Panic Station

4. Resistance 

5. Supermassive Black Hole (without the usual pre-solo riff, but with a new and improved outro riff) 

6. Animals (stock figures and creepy businessmen on the screens behind them) 

7. Time is Running Out (""Check out this dubstep bassline, from 2003"") + Whole Lotta Love outro 

8. Save Me (Wow this song is really awesome live...the ending gave me chills! Chris can totally sing lead live.) 

9. Madness 

10. Uprising (side note: perhaps it's because I haven't heard it in a while, but Matt's live guitar tone sounds better than ever) 

11. Follow Me (this song translates extremely well live) 

12. Plug In Baby

13. Knights of Cydonia (with Man with a Harmonica intro) 

**[Encore]** (if the E-Werk gig is a sign of things to come, then there will be three more songs; however, this is also a ""festival"" which usually have different types of sets than the regular stadium shows) 

1. New Born (""So uh Origin of Symmetry...didn't think we would play many of these songs again but we like this song so much...we couldn't resist."") (studio-version of the solo was performed, with slight variation) (Maggie's Farm outro) 

2. Starlight 

3. Survival (""This next song is about ancient genetics...when shit hits the fan(?)"") 

**[End of Show]**

Hmmm...a little disappointed only 16 songs were performed, but I'm still confident that the full tour will be closer to 20 songs. I'm also looking forward to the new stage design... 



**Special thanks** to /u/robalexander for reminding me of the show and /u/zozomuse for finding a stream that doesn't need an ID.

I've been a lurker on Reddit for a while now, but only recently started posting. I just stumbled across this sub-reddit and think it's amazing. I was hoping to tap into the collective mind for some help with my website. I've been running it for 8 years (wow, i feel old now) and it's in need of a few changes...

The site is called muselive.com and has been around since August 2003.

- Tech. it's currently running an *ancient* content management system (LDU, if any of you are familiar with it), which has been hacked to pieces and is falling apart at the seams. We want to move the site to a new platform (maybe Drupal), but it's going to be a herculean task. There's so much stuff hosted on our website, as well as rating systems and other bits of patchy code which would make a smooth migration almost impossible. How do you think we should go about doing this? We could either start completely afresh and build the site up from its previous ashes, or pay a lot of money (which we don't have) for a professional migration.

- Design. As you can probably see, it's a bit naff. Any ideas?!

- Funding. This is a tricky one... The site costs a LOT to run, which currently comes out of my own pocket. We've tried advertising in the past but it just doesn't make any dent - this might be related to the current site's design though. How would you go about raising money? We'd rather not ask for donations but I don't want to keep shelling out $200 / month for this.

Thank you all extremely :)"	t5_2qz0k	True

I'm betting they'll play Madness and Panic Station tonight. Maybe they'll get Supremacy if there's enough time allotted for them (then again NBC might just cut them out like last time). 

I'll be searching for a stream to help anyone in need of one, but quality cannot be guaranteed.

The piano groove that starts off the journey... the explosion and entry of the guitar... the clever key changes... then the crescendo finale with shattering falsetto. It's pure fury. I can't understand where those who thought the album needed some heavy tracks and yet despised this track. I personally think it's Muses heaviest song by the time it finishes up. The guitar riffs are absolute... metal! I know some metal heads that really enjoy that ending. But that's besides the point.

It's rather disheartening, really, to see a well crafted song I love get ripped to shreds... Who else loves Survival? How can others embrace it in a way they haven't?"	t5_2qz0k	True

There are so many good bands out there, with all their ups and downs. I was always a fan of hard rock / classic rock, and touched on light Metal and Pop Punk. Out of all this, no band has come to amaze me as much as Muse.

Personally, I want to find a band that's as full and powerful as these guys; I'm thinking songs like Space Dimentia and Megalomania, the raw power without being dull Drop D guitars and screaming. Maybe even electronic rock without so much dance, like Bliss or Uprising. I just want to find something new, Muse has absolutely taken over my music experience, I'm sure this is the case for many of you. Feel free to share any bands you guys like!"	t5_2qz0k	True

1. Prelude + Survival
-The first song heard from the new album. It's like I Belong to You and United States of Eurasia had a bastard child. The song's good but it's nothing compared to the next few.
2. Unsustainable
-The is the piece everyone was afraid of, the all so dreaded dubstep.
You may have heard this before but they used REAL INSTRUMENTS to make those drops. This song lacks lyrics (reporter and robot doesn't count) and at the most is Bellamy shouting. But this song is also quite well, poweful. Makes me wanna punch a wall when I hear the middle part.
3. Madness
-Ok, at first I was disappointed with this. I thought this was gonna be a rock song and instead we got a pop song(not saying its bad). But it's quite a grower. after a few plays I was hooked. 
4. Supremacy
-This. This is the most hyped song of the album. 7-string, orchestra, similar to Led Zeppelin's Kashmir. Epic. I thought Matt lost his ability to get those falsettos,I was wrong, he found it again. The riff reminds me of the ""funny riff"" from Glastonbury 2000.
5. Panic Station
-In my opinion the most unique song of Muse . It's funky as fuck. Chris slaps that bass like a bitch. It's extremely catchy and addictive. 
6. Save Me
-Ladies hold your orgasms. Matt gonna pass on the mic to Chris. This song probably has a connection with Chris. You can feel his passion and heart when he sang it, even I felt it. When you look at the lyrics they're very different from Matt's lyrics. Well I guess Dom's gonna have to rap on the 7th album.
7. Animals
-Very similar to Radiohead and song Muse songs(Screenager, Darkshines). I wanted it to be heavier and I was expecting a big verse like Hoodoo. But the solo is also good.
8. Follow Me
-They say the live version it a rock version of the studio version(fuck I said version three time). Anyways I like this song. It's chorus is similar to Neutron Star Collision. And the studio version is with Nero, ah yiss.

EDIT:
I forgot the preview of Isolated System...

Isolated System- a quiet piano with a slow build up. I expect a lot from this since it's the closer. I feel it's gonna be similar to Exogenesis III Redemption.

I'm purposely ignoring post that are about their tour. Not because I don't care, but I want to be surprised.

I just think it would be awesome to go into my first Muse show totally blind and unsure of what to be expecting. I want to be blown away by how awesome their set up is, and if their music on vinyl/CD/MP3/whatever sounds incredible, I can only imagine what their shows are like.

Edit: Thanks everyone! I tend to prefer Muse's earlier and more progressive songs, but those tend to scare people off if they're not used to that kind of music, so it's good to have some more perspectives. I guess I'll try the poppier songs like Starlight/Madness/etc for my friends who usually just listen to radio hits.

That's 'Scary Monsters' Bowie meets Primus,"" says Matt. ""Doing a *funk* track was for us remembering Rush and Primus, the more slap-bass things we liked.""


* (...) The final tracks ""The 2nd Law Part One: Unsustainable"" and ""The 2nd Law Part Two: Isolated System"" are doom-drenched operas full of newsreel reports from end of civilisation, *rapping Terminators*, trumpets inflating like lifeboats and *Exorcist* piano pulses tinkling goodbye to the globe.


* (...) While recording and self-producing 2009's 'The Resistance' Matt and Dom were largely alone as Chris' drinking problem kept him from the studio. This time, having been sober for well over a year, Chris wrote and and sang two of the album's songs - 'Save Me' and 'Liquid State'.


* Matt's concerns about industrial greed and business monopolies bleeds over into 'Explorers', an elegant choral pop vision of dying crops and abused nature. It's a song drenched in the sense of not feeling you belong on your own planet.


* 'Follow Me' is Matt's first ode to fatherhood (*OP's note:* it's also written that the beginning of the track includes the heartbeat of Matt's son, Bingham) 


* 'Madness' is an electronic cross between 'I Want To Break Free' and 'Faith' that he claims is about going cap-in-hand to Goldie Hawn's - mother of his girlfriend Kate Hudson - house. 


* ""We went to see *Skrillex* in Camden around October,"" says Dom Howard. ""We went, 'Fuck, it's so heavy,' loved it. It was like a full metal gig, they had the circles of death, people were moshing, I hadn't seen a reaction like that to electronic music before.

(Safety Spoilers for Stadium Tour)	lukehmuse	33	11	23	"When I mean self absorbed I mean just seemingly in his own little world not playing any instrumentation and just prancing about with the mic.  There must have been others who have been to the stadium gigs so far and noticed how often this happens now.

Perhaps this shouldn't bother me as it's probably something that's irrelevant in the grand scheme of things but, having went to the first Emirates gig and really enjoyed it, I came away thinking how annoying it was seeing Matt not actually playing anything on a bunch of songs and doing the full on 'Bono' moves of running along the crowd and this and that... I know he's been doing it during the stadium tour but it seemed like there were even more times during the Emirates gig that he wasn't using any kind of instrument and just spent the song wrapped around his microphone and just prancing about.

I mean... I know it's incredibly facetious and the gig itself was still amazing, but it bothers me. As an example it surprised me immensely that he didn't even bother with Starlight'a guitar and spent the song just dancing about essentially. Which is fine, if he wants to do that, but it just seems wierd. Or lazy. Or maybe it's just me. We do like to find things to moan about.

I don't do drugs, mostly probably because Muse gives me those feelings without any kind of supplements, but for those not in the know, a ""speedball"" is when you combine cocaine and heroin, and take em both in one go.

ANYWAYS, Unsustainable is the cocaine. It gives you that rush of short term absolute untouchable energy. Especially live, I can see this track having massive potential to just put everyone in the crowd down on the floor, whether it's from chills so strong that our knees just can't support the overwhelming feelings sure to come when they blow this out at us, or from the sound actually blowing us over.

Isolated System is the heroine, which brings us down from heaven nice and easy, not giving us any of the nasty short term withdrawals of the cocaine (unsustainable), just a nice cloud of a landing after getting slammed by the last track. Just a nice wind down to an incredible, energetic and out of control experience. When we Do get withdrawals, we can just listen to the two tracks (or the whole album) again.

I've been a ridiculously huge fan of Muse since the second I heard Muscle Museum back in 1999, and am so happy with everything they have done. I love this album, and I'm stoked for Chris stepping up and showing what he's got (He's always been one of my three favorite members of the band).

1349756904.0	116icc	The 2nd Law - The Anti-Resistance?	Rajah_Bimmy	30	9	29	"After a good several listen throughs, I've come to the conclusion that The 2nd Law is the complete opposite of The Resistance, does anyone else feel the same way?

Reasons Why:

1. The first time I heard The Resistance, I thought it was an amazing album. The 2nd Law kind of disappointed at first, but as I listen to it more and more I realize how creative and brilliant the songs are. While The Resistance immediately caught on, then faded, The 2nd Law has slowly been growing a place in my heart.
2. Thematically, The Resistance was an album about challenging oppression (Uprising, Resistance, USoE, Unnatural, MK); whereas T2L focuses more on how to embrace the truth that sometimes there is no way of stopping it, so we might as well move on (Supremacy, Animals, Explorers, Both T2L tracks). This is a new direction for Muse, as apocalypse isn't happening before us and we're not losing time to be together as everything decays. Instead, this new Muse focuses on dealing with a world we can't hope to control and relationships that are equally as difficult to control and fix.
3. The Resistance really lacked emotion. Undisclosed and IBTY were probably the most emotional tracks on there, but reeked of desperation to be a pop song and bombast. I personally like how Madness and Big Freeze focus on relationships. Save Me is in a league of its own. I know some people aren't too crazy about it, but the story and the lyrics and the genuine sound in Chris' voice just makes it seem like one of the most truly emotional Muse songs
4. The Resistance pretty much was a Queen cover album with 2 riffs in the mix of more Queen and a Timbaland track. On songs like Resistance it worked, Guiding Light... not as much. The 2nd Law sets itself apart by being quite similar to BHaR, when the band took different styles and blended them together, but never losing sight of the ""Muse-y"" sound. Sure Big Freeze sounds like a bad U2 b-side, but the toms and bass ground us in some classic Muse. Is Supremacy a James Bond knockoff? Of course, but who can object to a fucking timpani and a basic but fantastic riff. And yeah, Unsustainable is dubstep, but with a whammy pedal, pick scratching, and an orchestra. That is what I would call brilliance.

These are the big four reasons I would use to defend The 2nd Law as an Anti-Resistance. What do you think?

**TL;DR: The 2nd Law took time to grow on me, but feels like a more sincere Muse album than The Resistance**"	t5_2qz0k	True

I notice a group of people in the crowd have started using their phone flashlights to illuminate the haze in the air. One by one, people start taking out their phones and holding the lights into the air.

I've never seen anything like it, but pretty soon the whole arena had out their cell phone flashlights or even lighters, and the room was completely lit up.

Over on /r/radiohead I started these types of ""Tour Threads"" where I would update the main post with setlist information as it happened along with any pictures or videos that would come with the show. While this happened there would be discussion in the comment section and it was something nice the community could look forward to. I don't see the mods doing something like this yet, so I figured I'd take a risk and try things out. 

**[SETLIST]**

1. Supremacy

2. Hysteria (Interlude Intro)

3. Panic Station

4. Resistance

5. Supermassive Black Hole

6. Animals

7. Time is Running Out

8. Save Me

9. Madness

10. Uprising

11. Follow Me 

12. Plug in Baby (apparently they are still playing OOS material!) 

13. Knights of Cydonia (Man with a Harmonica Intro) 

**[Encore 1]** (not sure if this was actually an encore or not) 

14. Stockholm Syndrome 

15. Starlight 

16. Survival (I'm guessing the ~~main set~~ show is going to end here...)

So far the set isn't too surprising. Lots of new material with some of the classics thrown in.

The set is starting to become pretty interesting... PiB, KoC, and Stockholm Syndrome in the main set? What do they have prepared for the encores? 


**Post Concert Edit:** I'm surprised that the show was only 16 songs long...I suppose these pre-tour shows are just warm ups and are shorter than the normal length of the regular concerts.

I listened to the whole thing from start to finish uninterrupted, and **holy fuck**, I loved it. Absolutely from start to finish there was not one song (aside from Explorers, a *tiny* bit) that I felt was out of place or not belonging or weak. The blend of rock (and I don't like rock), some electronic (which is most of my music), and even some other genres (like funk in Panic Station) and some real cool use of symphonies (Unsustainable and Isolated System) was astounding. The intricateness of all the songs was amazing.

I'm completely and utterly hooked on this album. Now, my friend (who happens to know my picky musical taste) says I might not like their older work, even though it's generally regarded as better. I definitely want to listen to all their albums, but I'm scared they just won't be as accessible to me as The 2nd Law is.

What are your thoughts on The 2nd Law? Should I stick with it for a while or dive straight in to their other works? What would you recommend I listen to, in order?

So they've done Liquid State all 3 shows so far. I guess Save Me doesn't really work because then there would be too many slow songs. Nice to see Butterflies and Hurricanes again, but I dunno whether I'd prefer that or Dead Star. I guess since I saw Dead Star yesterday I'd take Butterflies, but if I hadn't I'd prefer Dead Star.

So, who was there? And how do you think the setlist compares to last time? Here's what's different from last night:

Edit 3: Know this post is old now, but just wanted to give an update. The concert in Malmø got cancelled due to Matt broke his leg (get better soon poor guy). I got really bummed out coz I was so excited to share the experience (whice a Muse concert is) with my friend. But we got refunds and they are planning on returning in summer which will be sweet.       "	t5_2qz0k	True

Please note: Some seat locations offered in the member presales will only be available for Will Call pickup and NO NAME CHANGES will be allowed.  We feel restricting the delivery method to Will Call only ensures that genuine Muse fans have the opportunity to purchase pre-sale tickets and limits buyers from purchasing and reselling their tickets for profit.  Some venues will be offering a “paperless ticket” for seats located within premium areas.  Any lines or signage referring to ""paperless tickets"" do not involve orders placed during the muse.mu member pre-sales.  If your delivery method is Will Call, your order will be waiting for you at the venue box office."	t5_2qz0k	True

So I've only seen Muse in concert once, it was a few years ago and it was hands down the best concert i've ever been to. I don't need to tell you all how amazing they are live. But I left the concert feeling really sad. Throughout the concert I got in impression that Matthew didn't want to be there, at all. He seemed very unhappy, and hardly interacted with the crowd, and didn't stick around after or anything like that. I was wondering for those of you who have seen them multiple times, or maybe have met them what is his personality like? is he just generally kind of distant and not friendly? Or was he just having a bad day?

Once again i know this isn't a horribly important question, but it's something i've wondered a lot about. I left the concert feeling sad, just because he seemed pretty unhappy to me during the show. Anyway, thanks guys!"	t5_2qz0k	True
1344895864.0	y6276	"""Unsustainable"" video- Screaming reporter  "	aeroferal	17	1	3	"Someone pointed out that during the 'glitches' when the woman is reporting you can see her face screaming and such. I see it as her internal emotions being shown, like she's scared and angry at the state of the world. She has to sit there with a straight face and report our inevitable downfall, and it's tearing her apart inside. I dunno, maybe looking into it too much, but that's a cool little aspect of the video that I like. Thoughts?
