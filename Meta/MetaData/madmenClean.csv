- Do you have any predictions as for the future of Don and, if the show continued past the time periods it is going to cover, how do you think Don would react to some events of the 80s, 90s, etc.

1372279083.0	1h4s3b	Dick and Don: An Adman and His Product in 60s America	HaveaManhattan	490	37	49	"   The original question on everyone's minds was Who is Don Draper?  Over the course of six seasons we have found out exactly who Don Draper is.  He's a cover identity for a war deserter, he's a successful ad man, a father, a husband.  Most of all, he's is the single greatest product Dick Whitman ever pitched.  Beyond that he's the single greatest product ever sold - The Postwar American Suburban Dream.

 Dick Whitman is the stone cold son of pimphood and whoredom.  He grew up in the clockwork mechanisms of the oldest business on earth, learning about it, and humanity, from a successful(so it would seem) man/rooster.  He's a little boy with an American dream, but with hard lessons learned. However he is no saint. When he steals Don Draper's dog tags it's obvious he's just as capable of human depravity as anyone else, even if it is justified to an extent.  After taking the name, he proceeds to start selling the brand of Draper as he himself is starting to buy into the creation and realization of a little boy's dream.  He pimps this image and the suburbs/office are the johns, buying into him and his family the way America bought into this Cold War dream.

 The Carousel ad (www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRDUFpsHus) is glaring proof of the product he has molded.  We believe the ad because Dick's pitch is true.  But he's not pitching The Carousel, he's pitching Don Draper, the product, most of all to himself.  The pictures are the early 1960s presupposed American Dream.  That's why he believes so deeply. (Edit: Look also at how he approaches American Airlines' crash: www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-iWbrT-nvI  Dick Whitman - That life, that crash happened to somebody else.  Don Draper isn't about the past, he's about the future, he's going to the moon.)  Eventually, when the picture perfect family breaks (literally when they have 2.5 children), what does Dick do?  He casts another actress for the part. That's the type of woman Draper marries, a casting call. He tried a new and improved rebranding.  The problem for Dick is that his product is growing stale and a new box(pun slightly intended) won't solve the problem.  As the decade moves on people want to buy it less and less.  America is changing.  They don't want that anymore. He's Avon.

Which brings us to Season 6, the breaking of Draper the product.  The first time Dick walks into the office who is it we see but Bob Benson, the alliterative doppelganger, and there in the elevator, with a shrug, a torch is passed to the new generation.  As the season progresses, we see that Draper, the product, no longer has a function in this new America.  He is replaced at home by Henry.  In the office by Ted and Peggy. As the office's object of sexual desire by Peggy.  Even the mystery of Who is Don Draper went away as we wondered Who is Bob Benson, the new interesting mystery man, who also takes Dick's unsexual friendship with Joan away as well as Draper's Iceman ability to destroy Campbell.  And what is Dick doing through all this?  Trying to sell a product that is not there.  It's worth noting that in all his ads this year, he doesn't show the products, no hotel, no Heinz, just as how in real life the product, Don Draper, does not show, but only Dick Whitman a mean man from a bad place who will do bad things to get ahead.  The whole season he has been an ad without it's product.
 
As a result Don the product is falling apart.  He's useless and hollowed out.  Dick needs to drink to be him, be that smiling guy but the drink isn't working.  Don's disheveled and messy haired, an American Dream falling apart, just like America.  When he is sober and slick haired Dick, he'll use a dead man for leverage.  He even tries one last reboot, moving to California like he's New Coke, and it falls apart just as fast.
 
Then Dick falls apart, realizing he can no longer sell this Ad, this product of Don Draper, to the most important customer  - himself.  He no longer believes his own pitch. The man who invented love to sell nylons can no longer sell a little boy's sweet dreams.  He sold Draper to himself the way we sold ourselves the American Dream and in that summer of '68 it all came crashing down like Dick. His confidence lost, the product gone, and then officially retired. The life of Draper the product is the rise and fall of that peculiar American Dream that came in the late 50s and lived and died through the 60s. An America, many would say, that never really existed but in our desires and product imagery.  And then Dick Whitman and his children go to work on the new American Dream for a new generation, 'because America isn't about the past...we're going to the moon'.  See you in '69.

In The Doorway, Don's failed Hawaii pitch is compared to A Star Is Born, particularly the 1954 remake with James Mason and Judy Garland. Weirdly, the usually movie-savvy Don has never heard of it. 

A Star Is Born is about a handsome, charismatic (alcoholic) actor who mentors an unknown young actress, Esther Blodgett. Esther is a sheltered but ambitious provincial girl who has great talent. Esther's career begins to rise, thanks to Norman's opportunities and mentoring. Esther tries to keep Norman's alcoholism from ruining his career, but he finds himself less and less relevant, until the only jobs he can get are jobs Esther can pull strings to get him. 

Eventually, as we know, James Mason wades out into the ocean and swims until he dies.

The parallels are clear enough on their own, but if you think back to Mystery Date (Season 5 Episode 4), Peggy says to Dawn *""I was discovered, like Esther Blodgett""*.
 
It's a very well-done, subtle allusion, and I wonder how far it will go. Will Don ruin his own career? Will he turn to Peggy for help? We already see him failing to connect with clients while Peggy is thriving. "	t5_2r7l7	True

Last week we left off with Peter amidst a potential divorce having been caught in an affair with the neighbor's wife by Trudy, Don tip-toeing around in his old ways, and Peggy proposed with an opportunity to snag a potentially unethical meeting with the Heinz account.


**DirecTV Info:** The partners try to keep a secret campaign under wraps; an old friend visits Joan.


**Discussion from last week's episode:** [Episode S6E03 ""The Collaborators"" Comment Thread [Spoilers] - submitted by Splintuh](http://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1ccvbe/episode_s6e03_the_collaborators_comment_thread/)

**Top Posts from Last weeks Thread:**

&gt;I fucking love Trudy and I fully expect her to destroy Pete when she finds out what an asshole he is.

First of all, typing them and saying them, the words look and sound really similar.

Second of all, butter is the old but more ""fresh"" in Don's mind. Betty has lost weight and she's looking good as new or fresh. She's also the traditional, what Don knows. Margarine is the new and ""indestructible"". Megan is sticking with Don despite all of his bullshit and behaviour, she's not going to be broken down by him.

Third of all, in e07 when Don and Ted get drunk and have their own 'rap session' about selling margarine. Don said some interesting things, like how no one prefers margarine to butter. In fact he's pretty down on margarine.

Then when he went on to describe the ad of a depression era family (he mentions the family has [Dorothea Lange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothea_Lange) faces) sitting down to eat breakfast. The whole thing seemed so wholesome, traditional, and natural with the bacon, cream, syrup, pancakes and then the addition of margarine just seems so jarring and out of place. If they were a dairy farm, as Ted suggests, with access to cream they would use butter, not margarine. They're kidding themselves to think that they could take something new and put it in the traditional thing's place without anyone noticing a difference. Just like how Don replaced Betty with Megan. In the end he wanted the same thing from his first  marriage but he tried it with a new and different woman, and it doesn't work.

Anyway, someone please help me out with this. I could have gone in too deep."	t5_2r7l7	True

His genius was in realizing that his ""client"" was Don. He had to first sell Don, who had moved on to racing heritage as the concept. He knew that old world Don hadn't locked down Megan in the housewife routine (as Roger suggested), and so he would identify with truly unattainable beauty. He sold Don, who then sold Jaguar.

Especially if you had a difficult childhood. You want to love them, but you don't. And the fact that you're... faking that feeling makes you wonder if your own father had the same problem.

Then one day they get older...and you see them do something... and you feel... that feeling that you were pretending to have.

1370262538.0	1fks8p	Some perspective on metaphors and symbolism (spoilers)	probablymattweiner	308	36	112	"1. Don Draper is dead.  He died in the Korean War.  Our friend Dick Whitman has been *masquerading* as a dead man.  This is what all of the death symbolism is alluding to in regards to Don.  Dick must now kill off the image of Don to emerge as his real self.

2. In the first episode Sylvia asks Don what he wants and he says ""to stop doing this."" He recognizes his infidelity to his wife as a weakness, a compulsion.  It is something he is trying to *get over.*  During the party scene in LA, Don is drawn by a woman to smoke hash.  By habit, he goes for it.  After he kisses her things get strange - the wife shows up, he is reminded that he is a dead person (Draper), and he apparently wanders into the pool out of self-loathing.  Don is a dead-man walking, quite literally, and he's trying to kill off Draper so Dick Whitman can emerge.  The entire show has been about this so I don't know why it is so mysterious for people to realize that what we're seeing is the mechanism of that death/rebirth.

3. There is no reason to believe Megan is dead or dying.  Here's how the narrative works:  Don realizes he is ""away"" from Megan right now, and he wants to be with her.  Megan in the hash-dream reveals that ""she lives here"" ie in a place where dead people live.  This is telling Don that in order to be ""with"" Megan he has to *die* - meaning he has to walk through that portal that resembles a death to him.  A metaphorical death is not a literal death.  Dick is killing Don Draper, subconsciously, and we're watching.  The Sharon Tate imagery, violence, ambulances, etc, that surround Megan indicate that Megan is in this place that is marked by death, violence, emergency.  Don is being drawn to those places, they are taunting him and sucking him in like a magnet.  He'll go through the door by season's end, that much is clear.

4. Draper's detachment from work.  Obviously Don doesn't care about work anymore.  Actually, Don does, it's Dick who doesn't.  Don Draper is the ad man and Dick Whitman is the guy who talks about cars walking around his neighborhood in San Pedro (LA) and being generally relaxed.  Draper the ad man has been slowly detaching himself from the business as Dick Whitman has been seizing control, giving up Chevy, and now, giving up his name on the wall of the business.  Remember that Don told Roger that ""when he leaves this place (Sterling Cooper), it won't be for more advertising.""

5. Mad Men is about how American society changed during the 1960's.  That's the entire arc of the show and it is what the show is ostensibly *about.*  The better you understand that era the better you understand this show.  One key theme revolves around the emergence of LA/California and the decline of NY.  We've seen NY become sleazier by the moment as LA represents the new hope.  People who *mattered* were leaving and things that one would expect to happen in the ""center of the world"" were now happening more frequently in California and NY was become less relevant, losing some of its grip on the cultural dominance of the country.  The immediate future is in California - NY is about to enter a severe twenty-year decline that it only begins to emerge from in the 1990's.  

6. Dick Whitman's life is in California and the West/Pacific in general.  He lived comfortably when visiting Anna there.  He connected with Megan there.  Hawaii is part of this western new world.  Megan is an actress who is probably about to get fired from her cheesy soap opera.  I foresee Megan getting a new job in LA, or getting fired from her show in NY.  Some additional drama in NY prompts radical change in their how climate and/or Don's work environment.  A move to LA is the end-game where Don can live finally as Dick.  First Don and the NY life have to die."	t5_2r7l7	True

I know, that's a little ridiculous to say because the show is all about his journey, but give me a moment. Is the show really about Don Draper, or is it about Dick Whitman finally coming to terms with who he was as a person? 

This entire season encapsulated everything that was wrong with the Don Draper concept. Everything that he's built himself up to be has started to break, and the season finale finally allowed for him to break free from Draper. 

First, there was the fight to go to California, where Don Draper was actually born. Don wanted to go back there in order to rejuvenate himself, but Dick Whitman won out and decided to give Ted the shot at California. This could be seen as selfless, but it was an attempt to save the last part of Dick Whitman that was left. (P.S. That's the ""good man"" that Ted was talking about when he was pleading with Don/Dick)

Second, the entire Hershey's pitch was Dick finally sabotaging the broken illusion  that Don has been trying to sell for the entire series. Dick doesn't allow Don to play games with his clients or his partners any longer, instead opting for the dark truth about the Hershey's chocolate bar. There is no reason for his moment of candor other than the fact that Dick Whitman has finally come to the surface. While Don had no problem selling lies to people, Dick did not want any part in selling some dream that didn't exist to some kid. 

Third, Dick finally takes his kids to the place where he was born. This shows that Dick is not only confronting his past, but also bringing his kids along the way. He realizes that there is no hope for Betty, Megan, or even Rosen's wife; no, only the kids can truly accept Dick Whitman as a person in this fresh start. 

That is why I believe that all the allusion to death this season is towards Don Draper the concept. He can no longer survive on the fuel of liquor or random women (edit: or California), for it has run him dry and has only left a lifeless corpse for Dick Whitman to put back together. 

edit: I'd like to refrain from painting Dick as a good guy and Don as the bad guy. Jesus made a good point in saying that it was a faulty equation. I think that Dick has more potential for good because it is a fresh start. "	t5_2r7l7	True

1369058785.0	1eozq7	Don and Women [spoilers to latest episode]	Second_Location	239	14	91	"Ok, so I think that this episode ""The Crash"" gives us an almost-complete picture of Don and his relationships to women. Pardon me if my citations are not thorough; I really need to do some other stuff today but I wanted to get this out because it's fun! Wall of text forthcoming! 

We see a series of crucial moments in Don's formative teen years, along with learning some more about his main female influences. Amy (Aimee, or ""loved"" in French), is the whore who was loving and maternal, but also took his virginity without his consent. She is also a literal mother, as evidenced by the picture of the baby in her room. I think this was a baby she gave away. Amy abandons Don over a dispute with the brothel owner about money. She is blonde and pretty with a (fake) beauty mark.

Stepmom (anyone know her real name?) is a maternal figure, but abusive and cold. She physically and verbally beats/lashes out at Don for having sex. She is confusing sexually to Don as he watched while she has sex with the brothel owner while very pregnant. She rejects Don continually, preferring her own son Adam as we see throughout the series. She is dark brunette and pretty (while young). 

Of course, Don's birth mother was also a whore, who abandoned him by dying. 

So....my theory is that Don has never been in love, he has only ever been triggered. 

Betty was blonde, pretty with a birthmark. She was probably very sweet and angelic when they met, a great potential mother. We know from evidence throughout the series that Betty likes sex, which is Don's major MO. But later she shows herself to be not a great mother (lashing out at Sally), and Don starts to see her as ""whorish"" (the bikini, etc). So that relationship dies and Betty abandons Don by asking for a divorce. 

Megan looks like his cruel stepmother but triggers Don's ""love"" when she acts beautifully maternal to his kids in the Disneyland episode. She looks just like a ""Maria von Trapp"" figure and he falls hard, marrying her without even really knowing her.  But she insists on being her own person and becoming an actress, a profession traditionally connected with prostitution by some. Don watches her simulate sex with a man on the soap set, just as he watched his stepmother have sex through the keyhole. Also, Megan is proving to be, in Don's eyes, a less than ideal mother. She abandoned his kids in this episode to go to a party (""casting couch"" as Betty says"") and her body even rejects his baby by miscarrying. I predict abandonment in the form of another divorce is coming soon. 

Sylvia is an even more intense trigger for Don than either Betty or Megan. She is VERY Madonna-like; Catholic, very proper, a good mother to her son. But she also seems very whorish to him; cheating on a good husband, wearing silky kimonos and living in Don's building just like Amy lived in the brothel with Don. Mixed in there is the fact that she really seems to care for Don and ""gets"" him in a way that others don't. So when she comes to her senses and abandons him by ending the affair, the rejection is even more brutal to Don. I think it's the last straw. 

Dawn and Joan represent Unfamiliar Other and Familiar Other, respectively. Dawn is black, and her unexplained disappearances represent how she is a whole new, unfamiliar kind of person to Don.  She flits in and out of his consciousness but does not trigger him in any way. Joan, notably redheaded instead of blonde or brunette, is an Other to Don but he totally understands her because a)she has been around a long time and b) they are a lot alike. In that gorgeous scene in the bar last season we learn that they never got together, even though they are the two most physically and sexually compatible people on earth by traditional standards. Don cares for Joan as a person and tries to do right by her, but she simply does not trigger him. 

So now, we have Peggy. Sooo interesting. As others have said, it is important that the series began on Peggy's first day of work at the firm. We the audience have seen her in many different and evolving roles. Girlish, innocent, inexperienced. Sleeping with Pete, denying her pregnancy, and giving up a baby (just like Amy!). Growing in professional competence, increasing in physical attractiveness. She has both maternally loved and nurtured Don (i.e. ""The Suitcase"") and lashed out at him harshly in recent episodes. She abandoned him by quitting her job, but she came back with Chaough and Co. 

In the past two episodes Peggy has said some very important things; ""Move forward"" and something like --""I have dealt with loss. You have to let yourself feel it. You can't dull it down with drugs and sex."" Don has spent his entire life dealing with the loss/absence of maternal love by dulling it down with sex and alcohol. So does this mean that Peggy is, as he said in his speed-addled state, ""the answer to it all""? Will Don finally reach self-actualization through Peggy? Will it be through deeper friendship, professional partnership or--gasp--his first experience with real love??? Or will Peggy's final rejection lead to Don's demise? I think this episode represents a major pivot towards the end of the series. Please join in and tell me what you think.

1371174683.0	1gb78p	Opinion: Don's redemption might not be coming, and isn't necessary	KingSchubert	227	23	90	"When I read Mad Men discussions online, I sense a lot of viewer frustration about characters' behavior, as well as some perceived frustration about characters' (especially Don's) often uneven trajectory towards happiness or redemption.  Especially now as we are one season and change away from the show's end, complaints abound that there is not enough narrative time for Don to fix everything/reach rock bottom.

The sense I get from this show, however, is that the viewers who are hoping for a tidy plot resolution or satisfying character arc for Don might be left sorely disappointed.  In my opinion (based on the last 6 seasons but exemplified by Roger's therapy session this season), Mad Men as a whole focuses more on providing an illustration of the often nihilistic absurdity of life.  The storylines seem to serve only as a tether which provide continuity as we experience these characters' choices and reactions.

""What is happiness?  It's the moment before you need more happiness.""  Don's comment, ostensibly a cynical insight on consumer psychology, is also the quandary which plagues many, if not all, of the show's main characters.  This line seems to mirror the concept of the ""hedonic treadmill"" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill) - a theory which suggests that ""...as a person makes more money, expectations and desires rise in tandem, which results in no permanent gain in happiness.""  Of course, this phenomenon is applicable to more than just the accumulation of wealth, and explains why Don continually seeks new sexual conquests regardless of his marriages, why Pete can never be satisfied with his position at the firm, why Roger acts so impulsively.

I believe that this concept is one of the most powerful themes running through this brilliantly written show.  Mad Men is not a soap opera, and taken on a mere surface level the various plot lines are usually not that interesting in and of themselves.  Through these stories, though, emerges a commentary on the choices we make in life, and our quest to wring the most happiness and satisfaction from it, viewed through the uniquely colorful perspectives of these various characters.

Don's eventual redemption isn't necessary, because that's not what this show is about.  We examine Don's reactions, judge his choices, and compare familiar (and unfamiliar) situations with things we have experienced in our own lives.  We watch these people scratch and claw their way through life, making choices - opening doors - and in their consequences, in their flawed humanity, lies the art in Mad Men.  This show truly is not about the destination, it is about the journey.

""What are the events in life? It's like, you see a door. The first time you come to it, you say, 'Oh, what’s on the other side of the door?' Then you open a few doors and then you say, 'I think I want to go over a bridge this time. I’m tired of doors.' Finally you go through one of these things, and you come out the other side, and you realize that’s all there are: doors! And windows and bridges and gates. And they all open the same way. And they all close behind you. Look, life is supposed to be a path, and you go along, and these things happen to you, and they’re supposed to change your direction, but it turns out that’s not true.  Turns out the experiences are nothing. They’re just some pennies you pick up off the floor, stick in your pocket, and you’re just going in a straight line to you-know-where."" - Roger Sterling"	t5_2r7l7	True

Throughout Season 5, Don is faithful to his new wife - a big change for Don. Towards the end of the season, with Megan getting acting and whatnot, Don seems to grow less connected to his wife.

In final minute of Season 5 Episode 13, there's the shot of Don walking away from the set. The studio fades away in the background while Don remains in the center of the frame. I think there is a lot of significance to this scene. He's growing more detached from Megan. 

He then sits at the bar, and orders an Old Fashioned for the first time in Season 5. He's approached by the girl who asks if he's alone. He makes that classic Don Draper facial expression before cutting away to credits. 

I thought his drink order had a lot of substance to it. The drink order itself - an Old Fashioned - implying that some things never change.

Tell me what you guys think. Any other significant moments like these I missed?"	t5_2r7l7	True

1370457274.0	1fqjth	So, Ginsberg (spoilers)	memorablememory	212	16	147	"So, Ginsberg may be suffering from undiagnosed schizophrenia.

In Episode 6x10 he just told Bob Benson that he can't stop the voices and ""transmissions"" into his head that are telling him to do harm.  This isn't the first time he has made the claim of hearing voices or being sent messages.  He told Peggy last season that he gets transmissions from Mars directly into his brain.

Often times people with schizophrenia are incredibly creative.  We know this about Ginsberg, and we know even Don has felt jealous of him (when he leaves Ginsberg's work in the taxi).

He lives with his father, but there's a lot of tension there, and he doesn't seem to (either want or have the ability to) seek or nurture many personal relationships.

What stood out to me in his statement was that he said the voices are telling him to do ""harm"".

This could mean a few things:

One, he could have been triggered into this panic attack by Jim Cutler calling him a hypocrite for helping harmful corporations like DOW Chemical.

Two, he has actually been hearing voices for quite some time that are telling him to do harm.

Three, he is talking about cultural voices and pressures from work, family, and the media, that make him feel like it is inevitable that all that all he ever does will cause harm.

When it comes to Mad Men and subtext, I think it could be all three.

So what do we think we will see here?  We know mental health services have a long way to go even now, but One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest was about this era.  We saw the clear mistreatment of depression from Pete's affair with Beth last season.

Will we see any intervention or medical help (or harm)?  

I don't think this is a coincidence, but I wonder where this will go."	t5_2r7l7	True

1370284783.0	1flhsp	Why Pete Campbell is freaking out. (spoilers)	beingjohnstamos	203	16	112	"Every time we've seen Pete in the office since the merger he's freaking out about some aspect of the business he's not involved with. This is mostly because he believes he's on the outside looking in at the new agency. Sometimes the paranoia is founded but from what we've seen so far there isn't some overt conspiracy to kick him out of SC&amp;P.

But Pete's paranoia plays into a larger part of his arch this season. Pete was introduced as a young account man with aspirations of climbing high in the agency. Well now he has what he wanted, a partnership and at  considerably younger age than most of the other partners. True his name isn't in the lobby but that day will come soon (again, he's young). 

So why is Pete Campbell freaking out? Because he has what he wanted but he never thought it would be like this. He never thought he would climb this far up the mountain to still have to fight the battles he's fighting. He mentally prepared himself for the job of a high level account man of the late 50's/early 60's only to realize it's a totally different job in 1968. Pete really is the only agency character that hasn't made some form of a change in line with the decade. Pete is still who he is when the decade began and he's trying to play catch-up. 

That's why the last moment of last night episode, experimenting with those jazz cigarettes, is so crucial. This could be the impetus for that change, to get with the times and realize he's working a job that is very different from the one he always thought he would have.    "	t5_2r7l7	True

But having just re-watched all the seasons (again), I have to say, the Draper marriage was fascinating. And I HATED her when I first started watching the show.

January Jones is not the strongest actress in the world, but I loved how her scenes captured suburban ennui. Her flat, cold delivery of lines grew on me in a way I didn't expect it to (I assume that Matt Weiner wrote the character to suit the actress after awhile). There were obvious problems in the Draper marriage, no one can argue that, but I thought the quiet misery of its two central players suited the atmosphere of the show beautifully. 

I think this probably ties into the uncomfortable shift the show has made from the subtle nature of the early 60's to the agressive, in-your-face honesty of the later part of the decade. I think they've navigated it quite well, but I still miss the early days of the series, and I definitely miss me some Sad Betty. And weird, smoking-in-the-bathroom Sally.

I think the attitude implied here is that Don's ""true character"" is defined by cigarettes, Old Fashioned's, and casual infidelity.  This also assumes that through all of the trials and tribulations from season 1 to season 5, Don has not evolved, changed, or grown more complex. In essence, that the show (or at least this season) has been solely driving to return Don to the exact point he started.

Now, is it likely that Don actually sleeps with one of those girls? Absolutely.  That does not mean that Don has returned to a state of early-Dondom, but rather that in a time of crisis and difficulty, he slips back into old habits. 

Don's return should be viewed tragically and pitifully, not affectionately.

[**How link spoiler flair works**](http://i.imgur.com/581Gaj7.png) &lt;--yes I used this for /r/FallingSkies

---

And then we have comment spoilers, we have two different ways to do it. That's right two, so if you do not understand one way, maybe the other will work for you. 

Spoiler comment: [Mad Men\](/s ""text here"") = [Mad Men](/s ""text here"") 

Other spoiler comment: [Spoiler\](#s ""Old Fashoned."") = [Spoiler](#s ""Old Fashoned."")

---

Another common sense rule, don't put spoilers in your title. Just don't do it. Spoiler post titles should be vague, and still marked with the spoiler link flair.

He even used the solider's exact words. In this case, their roles are reversed with Don setting at the left hand of the bar, throwing a potentially ludicrous idea (being the brides father vs. merging agencies) rather than being the one on the receiving end of a drunken idea.

Every week r/madmen has been able to analyse and experience another character, Don Draper.  I think we need to all recognize that without Tony, there would be Don.

Obviously it was not the series finale. They are talking about season 7, there will be a season 7.

But say last night's episode was the series finale, would you have been happy?

- For once, Don told the truth about this past and the in the end is shown trying to make amends with his children.

- Peggy's final shot is the final Draper shot in the opening credits, showing everyone that she is the new Draper.

- Joan finally lets Roger into their son's life.

- Pete and Ted are both shedding all their troubles in NY and moving to CA.

1355585302.0	14wa5o	Mad Men has really evolved over five seasons.	florgus	163	22	48	"I just re-watched all five seasons. If you have vast amounts of free time, give it a try!

On first viewing, my season rankings were 3,1,5,2,4.

Once re-watching, my season rankings are 5,4,2,3,1. How weird is that?

I will say that seasons 1 and 3 have the best *moments* which is probably I liked them so much initially. When you're re-watching, though, you're in a different place. You're seeing things you didn't see before, really wrapping your head around the narrative, picking out details in the cinematography, etc.

First off, I don't know if Mad Men can give me another any more scenes like the Carousel Pitch, Nylons Monologue, Lucky Strike Pitch, etc. I know too much about Don now. When he rallies the troops for Jaguar or meets with Dow Chemical, he is still casting his spell, but a big part of that spell is the mystery - nobody really knows Don, and that turns out to be a key ingredient in what he does. Now that I know him so thoroughly, his ability to pitch me with feeling is inherently diminished. I'm not sure if this is intentional on Weiner's part, but if it is, it is brilliant. 

Additionally, we've seen fewer ""gotcha"" moments that were all about exploiting the shocking juxtaposition of today's mores with yesteryear's, or just shocker gotchas. Less focus these jarring zingers (which I loved, especially on first viewing, and still enjoy) such as adults-who-aren't-their-parents-slapping-kids, families-dumping-trash-indiscriminately-in-public-parks, kids-running-around-in-dry-cleaning-bags, people-getting-their-feet-mowed-off, blatant-office-sexism, Roger-in-blackface, oh-my-gosh-they're-all-smoking-and-drinking moments. The difference in the times is still there, but it isn't as overt. This is now an accurate a period piece unlike any we've seen, and instead of those differences being over the top, they're now just part of the backdrop.

Instead of wow-factor moments where I feel like Don is pitching both me and the client, I'm left with the tapestry of all of the characters; coming to understand them, observing their changes, and the critical inflection points of their existences. I don't view this a bad thing. Don can no longer pitch me, but his life now matters to me, and never did it feel more visceral than the season 3 finale. The narrative itself has become the appeal of Mad Men instead of just waiting for cool pitch moments. Think of the scenes in the Suitcase, or more recently scenes from Signal 30, Christmas Waltz, The Other Woman, Commissions and Fees, and the Phantom. (Wow, Season 5 ended with a strong series of episodes!)

I'm extremely hopeful for the near-future and conclusion of this television serial. It is absolutely a triumph on the part of Weiner and Co., especially that it just keeps improving."	t5_2r7l7	True

1371563393.0	1gl0yf	[Spoilers 6x12] Was surprised to see nearly everyone came away with a different interpretation of the episode than I did (re: Don Draper)	karthrowaway	149	20	104	"I hate questions on reddit that begin with ""Does anyone else...?"", because inevitably, yes, *someone* else agrees with you. That said, does anyone else think Don Draper was *not* a total monster in the last episode?

Don is and will always be a bit of a douche bag, and I'm not going to defend some of his actions - the vodka drinking in the morning, the tuning out Megan in the end, etc - but in regards to Ted and Peggy, I don't think he was entirely in the wrong. The client wasn't going to spring for the extra $25k, before or after the fact, and when the representative from St. Joseph's said they weren't pleased with the budget, Ted even fibs and says that he sent it over ahead of time in order to put everything on the table, because that was the right thing to do. Ted purposely kept Peggy in the dark about something due to his attachment. For a female character, that should feel as patronizing and condescending as anything, because it's basically treating her as an emotional creature first and a professional person second.

Don did not just tell Ted what he was doing wrong, because he knows that Ted won't listen. How does he know? Because, as he said, ""We've all been there."" Don might be jealous that Peggy has Ted (or that Ted has Peggy), but he's twice as jealous because he and Megan used to be flirty work couple and he was the one who became so focused on what he saw in Megan that he forgot to treat her like a person and an employee. I think a lot of his actions in the last episode stem from the fact that he really does see his old mistakes in Ted, and he wants to make Ted realize them instead of just telling him.

This is why he pulls the douchebag alpha move in the meeting, where he says there's a very personal reason why they are pushing the advert so intensely. It makes Ted realize that everyone in the entire room knows what that reason is, except possibly Peggy, who might think the reason is ""The ad is really, really good."" (It's hard to read her reaction during that scene). Ted, who was worried that Peggy and his hands touching briefly and a quick smile during a presentation three months ago, is now so blatant in his emotional affair that Don Draper, who has spent the majority of the season ignoring everything except his own wants and needs, knows what is going on. 

I found myself in the same position a few weeks ago, when Joan pulled a trick on Pete with the Avon account. To be honest, I wanted to root for Joan (just like I'd rather root for Peggy or Ted here), because I like them. But I think in both situations, the likable character might be in the wrong.

* He basically runs the entire TV department- that he created. It seems based on some of the meetings they've had that TV commercials are a major source of billing. For example, with Dow Chemical and Heinz. I wonder where they would be without his work on this which is largely solo. 

* Calling Joan out as being like a prostitute was not cool. It is true that she is responsible for the logistics of the office and does a lot of work and has to put up with a lot of shit in order to maintain the respect she deserves. But thinking about it in terms of the business, they basically made the chief administrative officer a partner. Certainly there is an argument here that if a person in that position can be promoted so highly, that clearly Harry, who performs largely by himself what is undoubtedly an integral part of their business model, deserves the same level of recognition and compensation.

* A lot of their not liking him depends on their original image of him as a pushover nerd from season 1 (or something like that). I think he is right when he says they don't realize the extent to which they depend on him for that reason. 

All that being said, he was being a fucking ass and it was uncalled for. But I think he was right to demand more, just not in the way that he did it.

edit: I just wanna clarify something...saying that Joan did something disgraceful or unworthy to get on the board, saying she slept her way to the top...that is a HUGE double standard in my opinion. Think of all disgusting and awful things that Pete and Roger have done to get and keep accounts. Think of all the whorehouses and the drinking and the cheating. Think about firing Sal because the Lucky Strike guy was paranoid about being outed, Sal who just wanted to pretend the whole thing never happened, then think of him groping male employees at the Christmas party, and then tell me that Joan is any more disgraceful than anyone else in that room. And let's not forget - Joan only knew about the offer because the board guys TOLD her about it. So I don't see how you can criticize her and not criticize every single person in that room ten times worse. So for Harry to single her out like that when he knows the kind of shit that everyone else gets up to, and that HE HIMSELF has participated in is fucking bullshit. When Joan does it is wrong and cheap, but when the men do it, boys will be boys.  That being said, he is doing good work besides that he is a dick about it."	t5_2r7l7	True

1366192968.0	1civto	I believe that each of the circles of Hell was shown in the first two episodes in order. Also, Betty is better? *Season Premiere Spoilers*	JudgeDan	150	19	55	"Like I said, I have rewatched the season premiere two-parter and believe that each one of the circles in Hell is confronted, in order. I took a course over the Divine Comedy last semester, but am in no way a Dante scholar.

**Limbo**: I believe that it is important to look at Limbo as being the closest non-believers can get to perfection. As you can guess, Hawaii is supposed to represent Limbo.  Megan even calls it paradise, but Don clearly sees that it is lacking.  He, like the virtuous pagans, know there is something better out there. It also could be viewed that vacations are merely how we suspend our real lives. They may be fun, but they aren't of any substance, much like Limbo.

**Circle 2--Lust**: The next major example of one of the circles of Hell is when Betty confronts Henry's lust.  Of course, she overdoes it, but he clearly was lusting over this underage girl.  

**Circle 3--Gluttony**: I believe this was expressed when Don overindulged and threw up at the funeral.

**Circle 4--Greed**: I actually thought this was well-written.  I believe this was shown when Roger's daughter takes his money instead of his sentimental gift.  It shows she doesn't really care for her family, but rather money. 

**Circle 5--Anger**: This is probably the least solid one I found.  I think it was shown in Betty's dialogue with the ""commune"" teenager.  He, unprovoked, verbally attacks Betty.  She, in return, almost steals the violin.

**Circle 6--Heresy**: I think this was shown when Roger was at therapy.  He refuses to acknowledge what the meaning of life is.  In fact, he states, ""All I acknowledge is that all of this will eventually end. And somebody else will get the bill."" 

**Circle 7--Violence**: One of the methods of violence is the violence against oneself. This is where the forest of suicides takes place. This was expressed when Don tried to pitch the ad to the hotel people. Although Don didn't realize it, his work portrayed suicide.  I also think this hints that at some point Don will contemplate suicide in the near future. 

**Circle 8--Fraud**: This was another sketchy one, as I don't think it does justice to Dante's meaning of fraud.  Instead, I went with the contemporary meaning where someone merely isn't who they say they are.  This is shown all through the New Years party at Don's apartment. The story about the coworker who was revealed to be a homosexual when he was caught in the bathroom.  Going back to the slide where Don gave the bride away, despite not even knowing her.  Even the fondue is covering one thing in something else!

**Circle 9--Betrayal**: This was the easiest and is what actually made me go back through and try to find the rest.  It was finally revealed at the end that Don started cheating on Megan. Not only that, but he is cheating with a woman that is married to the closest thing we've ever seen to a friend of Don. Double betrayal.

**Bonus**: While rewatching, I noticed that Betty was actually doing the opposite of the deadly sins a lot of the time. She called her husband out on lusting. She kept to her diet instead of gorging. She helped the kids make soup.  She ended up not taking the violin out of anger. She even dies her hair black to get rid of her fraudulence. Needless to say, I was very impressed with the development of her character on that episode."	t5_2r7l7	True

1339511610.0	uxyxk	{Spoilers} Finally, something beautiful you can own. Thoughts regarding Megan and Don and the Season Five promo poster. 	Togaz	148	17	40	"One of the major plot threads in this season was the pursuit Jaguar account, for which Don creates the ""Something beautiful you can own"" campaign. In a way, I think that this pitch was the summation of one of the season's biggest themes. Throughout this season we've watched the honeymoon phase of Don and Megan's relationship fade, and seen increasingly more comparisons made between Megan and early Betty. What is it that shifts Don's perception of his wives? I think it is the moment he feels like he 'owns' them--the moment that he has all the power in the dynamic. When Megan gets the acting job because of Don's power it shifts their dynamic. She's no longer working for herself, she owes her career to him. The mystique is gone because the chase is over. As disturbing as some of their fights were in season five, the struggle was what kept Don interested. Megan was a challenge, she had her own opinions and motivations and kept Don guessing. Now, with the beauty and the beast commercial, Megan is on a path to become exactly what Joan predicted. Whenever Don's life too-closely mirrors the American Dream image he has himself worked so hard to propagate, he starts looking for more happiness. He has to walk away from the set because no man truly wants to live in a world of their own creation. There's no fight in that, and men like Don need a fight. They need to get their mouths bloody.

1339467532.0	ux81t	The screen test - what Don saw		153	21	65	"Don watching Megan's screen test is a critical moment.  Clearly something about it changes his mind and we see the season's arc-of-change really come into focus after that.  Yet most people seem unclear about what happened in that scene and it's critically important to what comes next:

Don is watching a *screen test* of his wife.  This is a reel of film designed to show an actor's ability.  She's going through her various poses, looks, etc.  Don recognizes those looks - they're the ones he thought were just for him, the sideways glance, the eyes turned down, the hair moved slowly behind the ear.  

Previous seasons have shown that Don really understands when he sees things on film.  It's a recurring theme going back to S1.  After watching Megan's screen test he cringes a little.  He's getting wise to her act.  And he sees that it worked on him.  It must be pretty good.  So yes, she can be an actress, but maybe he doesn't like actresses.

1367417602.0	1dhcgm	Heinz as a metaphor for Megan/Sylvia	foreveracubone	138	18	55	"So in writing a post earlier this morning about Kenny as the person at SCDP with the most integrity, it dawned on me that Heinz is a metaphor for Don's relationship with Megan and Sylvia. 

Megan is the reason that they landed the beans account in the first place via her coming up with the inspired pitch and knowing when to pull the trigger at dinner. This point is further reinforced in our minds in the last episode where she wins an award for the work that she did. 

When ketchup first comes to SCDP, Don is the one who tells Kenny that they can't go after ketchup if it will upset Raymond and the Beans division because that's their 'girl'. Ken takes this point to heart, but Don clearly doesn't...

The very opening scene of the next episode is in Pete's adulterers pad, with Don being wooed by the promises of the 'new girl' and the guarantees that his current relationship will learn to deal with it. He falls in love with Ketchup and believes that the superiority of his position will mean Beans will fall in line. 

The dalliance comes back to bite him in his face in a very public way with him losing both relationships. I think the metaphor is pretty clear, the question is just whether the manner in which the dissolution of both of Don's romantic relationships is what is being foreshadowed or not. Perhaps Megan's award amidst an otherwise awful day is foreshadowing how she salvages happiness out of leaving the relationship as well. 

Unsure if something similar has been posted before, but what do y'all think?

1337098543.0	todh5	Some thoughts on Betty...	partspace	136	17	73	"In ""Dark Shadows,"" Betty seems to be returning to her manipulative, mean roots in her attempts to poison Don's relationship from 50 miles away. Last night, I was thinking about her character and why she is so unhappy, and a simple thought occurred: She's depending on the men in her life to make her happy, rather than herself.

In visiting Don's apartment, there was an alternate reality moment. ""If Don and I had stayed together, if we didn't have children, this is where I would be."" In the divorce, Don got to leave the life as a father in the suburbs and do whatever he wanted with whoever he wanted. Betty did not have this opportunity. She's still stuck being a housewife with the kids in the 'burbs, just with a different man. And she is still unhappy. 

Betty is not a good mother, and I don't think she really wants to be a mother and housewife. She just became a wife and mother because that was what women did, pure and simple. Don has the luxury of running away from his problems (and he often does), while Betty cannot. Her lack of options is making her miserable. 

She does not know how to make herself happy. She's even denying herself the ability to enjoy a mouthful of whipped cream (a scene that made me incredibly sad). Time and time again she is turning to the men in her life for fulfillment, and time and time again she is disappointed and doesn't know why. 

Betty desperately needs some exposure to the feminist movement of the 60's, but I think it's too late for her. Everyone seems to hate Betty, but I just feel hopelessly sad for her. She's a victim of the times, she is incredibly flawed, and she's taking it out on everyone around her."	t5_2r7l7	True

Season 5 (the latest season) took place in-canon between Memorial Day (May 30) 1966 and Spring 1967. 

This means that if Season 6 follows the same pattern, it will take place in canon between May of 1967 and Spring of the following year, which is 1968. And Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968, according to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.). 

So I think we'll get to see everyone's reaction to his death. It's going to be interesting. I thought we might see something like...we get everyone's reaction in the office, and then we see the reaction of Dawn (Don's African-American secretary--the only person of color in the company). 

Any thoughts? Sorry for rambling.

Edit: Just read a little bit about the [Summer of Love](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_of_Love), which takes place Summer 1967...I wonder  how they will tackle this on the show? Will Roger have another trip? Will Sally and Glen smoke pot for the first time? Hmm.

After Don turned down the offer from McCann he went to Roger's offices to re-negotiate his conditions at SC. This is how it went down:

  Don: No contract.

  Roger: Well, what's in it for me? 
 
 Don: If I leave this place one day, it will not be for more advertising.

  Roger: What else is there? 

  Don: I don't know. Life being lived. I'd like to stop talking about it and get back to it.

  Roger: I've worked with a lot of men like you, and if you had to choose a place to die it would be in the middle of a pitch.

  Don: I've done that. I want to do something else.

Don died in the middle of the Hershey pitch, but Dick lives on.  This could also foreshadow a possible departure from advertising for Don/Dick.  I may have read into this, as we are all capable of doing but it seemed really interesting.

1337176127.0	tpxkl	Let's talk Don and the rebirth of dicketry at SCDP.	DidntClickGuy	121	12	74	"One of the major themes of this season has been the resentment building among the big players at SCDP.  Bert is mad at Don for not being around to run his department.  Peggy is mad at Don for putting all the workload on her.  Pete is mad at Don because he feels Don is judging him hypocritically.  But Don has let this all just roll off of him, and it's pretty clear that Megan's presence is the reason why.

But now Megan is not there, and Don's brutal approach to his co-workers has returned, especially toward Ginzo, whom Don perceives as a threat, and toward Pete, who is clearly in the middle of some kind of breakdown that Don has been heretofore handling carefully.

And I was thinking about this, I came across four younger people who have reacted very differently to being confronted with Don and his ... peculiar professional approach:

* Pete learned very early on that Don would destroy him if he stepped out of line, and he has internalized that lesson.  Pete is now the hyper-competitive, ruthless predator in the office, but there is still a part of him that yearns for a workplace where it feels like everyone is on the same side.

* Peggy has had periodic confrontations with Don about his imperious (""I'm the boss, you do what I say"") management style.  In some ways this has changed her - she is definitely more cold and competitive than she once was - Megan definitely points this out.  But I think it's pretty clear that she doesn't like the office the way it is, with no cooperation and no help.  The resistance inside her is building, especially since she stopped taking Don seriously when he married Megan.

* Megan was horrified by the office environment at SCDP - she perceives it as cynical and heartless.  It's the main reason she wanted out, I think.  Megan, I think, is very symbolic of this new movement of the late 60s - young people, driven away from ""the system"" because of its aesthetic ugliness, seeking an elusive emotional satisfaction through unconventional activities.  SCDP is what it is partly because of Don's influence - and Megan is going to have to face this fact sooner or later.

* Ginsberg is something altogether new.  He is an energy that will not be contained.  Don's conversation with him in the last episode eerily recalled similar conversations with Pete (""I don't think about you at all"") and Peggy (""You should be thanking me""), but honestly I don't think Ginzo is going to be intimidated.  Call it character or call it abnormal psychology (there's a good argument for both), I just don't think Ginzo has it in him to back down from that conversation the way everyone else did.

Don's ideas are old and tired.  I think a Ginsburg Tsunami is coming that will change everything, and I think Peggy is going to have to choose a side."	t5_2r7l7	True

 Yes Betty is vain, immature, depressed and a poor parent.    Her voice is wan and her expressions range from a forced smile to a grimace.  She is shallow in every sense of the word.  I don't like her at all.  But that is the character.  That is who she was raised and conditioned to be.  She married a man that won't even include her in the basic nature of his childhood.  She has no one to listen to her complain, rage or laugh.  Her mother has passed, her husband excludes her on every level. Society expects her to shut up and take it.  She would be relatively monotone and tragic.  She is the prom queen long after the music stopped.

I think the stiff upper lip that sometimes trembles is a perfect portrayal. January plays her with subtlety.  Occasionally I don't understand the choices she makes like the bar scene by herself or the thing with her riding friend. They seem more ugly than she has appeared so far. But I put that more on lack of written development, than poor acting.

She is what my mother idolized and feared in equal measure, as she was of a similar age.

1366038992.0	1ce5fr	Dante's (and Don's?) Inferno (spoilers; theory)	lemon_meringue	107	14	45	"So the season opened last week with Don reading Dante's *Inferno* in paradise. Cute, right? Well, as a former literature major, I kept ruminating on the nine circles of hell all week long, and I think it might be possible that Matthew Weiner has a season-long arc that may be loosely built around Don's journey through Dante's hell.

Check out this Wikipedia article and pay special attention to the types of people and sins being punished in each circle. 

The first circle (that would be last week's episode), or ""Limbo"", is reserved for ""virtuous pagans and the unbaptized"". It's where ""the guiltless damned are punished by living in a deficient form of Heaven."" I think last week made it pretty clear that all the main characters are living in such a deficient form of heaven - especially Don in his listless marriage to Megan (and his oddly heatless affair with Sylvia), Pete in his hermetically sealed suburban union, and Betty in her political marriage. Peggy's situation is similar: she's in an *okay* relationship and has an *okay* job where she's *sort of* respected (or feared) by people she doesn't really like working with. Roger Sterling's therapy sessions made it clear that he views his entire existence as a sort of Limbo. Joan managed to get a partnership, but the cost was extremely high, and the payoff remains to be seen.

The Julius Caesar ""lend me your ears"" advertisement is another reference that made me perk up my ears, as it made me think about all the ""virtuous pagans"" in Dante's first circle.

The second circle is Lust. From the wiki article:

&gt;Dante condemns these ""carnal malefactors"" for letting their appetites sway their reason. They are the first ones to be truly punished in Hell. These souls are blown back and forth by the terrible winds of a violent storm, without rest. This symbolizes the power of lust to blow one about needlessly and aimlessly.

Every single main character last night who received story focus was dealing with the effects of allowing their sexual appetites to override their moral compass or good judgment. Pete torpedoed his perfectly good arrangement with Trudie to satisfy his momentary lust for his neighbor's wife. The flashbacks to the whorehouse where Don spent his formative years floated through the action and shed light on yet another portion of Dick Whitman's views on relationships as transactions. Megan's ""miscarriage"" (abortion?) was a direct result of lust - lust led to the conception, and lust for her career led to her decisions to keep the pregnancy from Don/abort the fetus.

It seems that he and Megan are a particularly bad match, as she comes from a background where men aren't trustworthy (her philandering father) and Don's background was rife with shady women. Lust drives them both, but it is also its own punishment.

If I'm even remotely on target with this theory, next week should be a meditation on gluttony. Don's alcoholism has been ratcheting up incrementally, and Betty has clearly been guilty of this particular ""sin""...perhaps Peggy's nascent ambition might even be classified as a form of gluttony?

Does anyone have any thoughts on this? I love to sift through plots and writing for stuff like this, but I recognize that I can get a little carried away sometimes. "	t5_2r7l7	True

1370920871.0	1g3g6t	Bob Benson Is Innocent	teeuncouthgee	114	18	38	"I've seen a lot of theorising about Bob Benson's pass at Pete as some kind of elaborate, misdirecting double-bluff, and as a gay man, thought I might weigh in.

The crucial thing for most people seems to be Bob's continued flirtation *after* Pete's ""degenerate"" comment. The implication being that, given clear evidence of Pete's obvious distaste, Bob should've realised he had no chance, and given up.

I rather interpreted Bob's flirtation post-""degenerate"" (from my biased, sympathetic perspective) as an overly-hopeful attempt to change Pete's mind through the power of his affection alone. His speech, in particular, is all about overcoming ""impossibility"":
&gt;Is it really so impossible to imagine...that if someone took care of you, really good care of you, if this person would do anything for you, if his wellbeing was his only thought, is it impossible that you might begin to feel something for him? When there's true love, it doesn't matter who it is.

If this speech reminds me of anything at all, it's the logic underlying the modern ""friendzone"" phenomenon, where being good to someone and taking care of them should (apparently) help the otherwise disinterested party overcome their superficial feelings and realise who they really love deep down.

Now, obviously being deluded about one's chances with a crush, and continuing to pursue someone who's never going to reciprocate, are not behaviours unique to gay people. But I do think it's exacerbated by a setting as closeted as the 60s, where nobody can talk openly about sexuality anyway, making rejection more open to interpretation: does he really think we're degenerates, or is he pretending because he thinks I'm part of the social system that will judge him for not thinking that? Or, is he himself repressing his true feelings because he's internalised this homophobic world?

The speech, in combination with Bob's incredibly hopeful nice-guy face as he talks about his ""true love"", and with his attempt to pay for Pete's prostitute (making himself by proxy responsible for Pete's pleasure), makes me think less that he's manipulative and more that he's just flawed and human and fallen for someone who can't feel the same.

And anyway, if he is a spy and not gay, propositioning Pete as a bluff doesn't really make sense. How could he be sure that Pete wasn't just deeply closeted? What if Pete hadn't pulled away? What would he have done then? At the very least, he's both gay *and* manipulative."	t5_2r7l7	True

[Spolier alert! Lots of thoughts on tonights ""Commissions and Fees"" episode.]

I've been reading in this subreddit a lot of discussion about how after marrying Megan, Don's gone soft. Obviously, I agree with a lot of this commentary and even witness several times how Don has not been working as hard as he has in other seasons.

But tonight...I feel like we welcomed Don back and Roger stated this as well. Bert Cooper comes into Don's office and confronts Don about the check Lane forged. Futhermore, Cooper tells Don to stop being the ""good little boy"" which goes back to the partners meeting in the beginning of the episode. So Don, as we know,fires Lane like an adult should.  Of course we see the effects of this decision, which Don did not actually cause if you think about it. Here's why:

1. Lane stole the money, not Don. 
2. Lane has been struggling since he first appeared on the show to deal with his wife, kid, and finances. 
3. Don has no control over what Lane tells or does not tell his wife about work or money. 
4. ...Lane's wife exacerbated the problem by presenting the Jaguar. Only further reminding Lane of the damage he's done. 
5. No one helped Lane hang himself. 
6. Lane Pryce was a weak character. He was a push over to become partner and a push over as a husband. He's the one who kept everything hidden and that makes him (ALMOST) in the same slimy ball catergory as Pete Campbell. 

So while I was reading the comment thread I read a lot of ""Fuck Don Draper!"" etcertera's and I think, ya know what? In this episode, Stella (Don) got her groove back! Don handled his business and even went after new leads. I feel like the meeting he had with Ken's Father-in-law was comparable to the Kodak scene in season 1. 

Anyways, That's how I feel. I am sorry Lane died the way he did. I do believe suicide is the worst option. I believe that there is always (ALWAYS!) a way out that is not suicide. If you watched tonight and have been feeling down like Lane ,there's help out there.

Rusty_the_Scoob	105	11	20	"It hit me this morning how similar Ken Cosgrove and Megan are:  both are looking for a creative, fulfilling outlet besides advertising, but their circumstances lead them to pursuing it in different ways.  Megan is free to pursue her dream fully while Ken has to change his pen name when it's discovered, in order to hide his efforts.

Both Ken and Megan had similar lines delivered to them:  Peggy told Megan ""this is as good as this job gets"" and Roger told Ken (paraphrasing here, I don't remember the exact line) ""when this job is good, it fulfills every need"".

Looking closer, I think it's part of a larger theme; various characters have different levels of commitment to their jobs.   Don and Roger are disinterested in theirs to varying degrees, Stan seems to work hard but sees the bigger picture that his work is meaningless and increasingly outdated (he's an illustrator like Sal, in a time when Photography is taking over), Ken and Megan I mentioned earlier.

This is Don pitching the Kodak Carousel.  Let's remember Don's description of nostalgia in thinking about his emotions in this last episode.

Now let's look at Joan.  Don's platonic friend, a woman he respects, a woman he cares for and protects, yet a woman who he is almost proud to see can take care of herself, even as a single mother.

BUT.  In this past episode, she is a shadow of Don's mother, who was **literally a prostitute**.  Joan has been prostituted, and furthermore, is a prostituted mother with a son at home.  When we saw Don's disgust and disappointment in Roger's office as he realized what Joan had done, and when we saw Don at least thinking he ""ended the discussion"" of the prostitution, and when we saw Don disgusted with Pete and visiting Joan's house to tell her ""it's not worth it"", were we seeing shadows of delicate, but potent nostalgia in the the creases of Don's concerned face?  How much of what we saw was Don Draper wanting to win Jaguar with sheer advertising prowess, and how much was Dick Whitman trying to save a respected woman from becoming his mother?

1336402450.0	tb800	The elevator thing (obviously spoilers)	polynomials	104	14	90	"There is a dark undercurrent to Megan and Don's relationship as we have seen all season. Blowout fights followed by crazy sex, Don's borderline domestic violence, not to mention all the references to death- taking off his shoes just before he got into bed while he was sick (I don't get this one but my gf says ""taking off shoes = death"" is a common literary motif, maybe someone knows about this), then murdering that chick in his dream, and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember. 

Then of course the best of them all, the empty elevator shaft as Megan leaves SCDP for the last time. He's going to go down to talk to her and maybe stop her, he's changed his mind, he opens the elevator. The only thing along that path is rumbling abyss. It's almost like Megan has left and the world is inviting him to kill himself. That's how Don subconsciously interprets it I think. Or it's warning him that he should not try to follow her along the path she is going. That way lies death. 

Don has too much of his own identity wrapped up in this woman who wants be something other than his wife. He likes her independence but only insofar as it presents a surmountable challenge for him. He is not used to having a woman not be preoccupied with pleasing him(or hating him after she is done pleasing him). My prediction is that Megan is going to see some success as an actress despite Joan's catty predictions (she also predicted she would fail at copyright as she herself said). Don will have a very hard time processing this because as we have seen he thinks everything is about him (remember how the orange sherbet thing was supposed to embarass him? also the way he reacted to her sexy dance in the premiere). She will be somewhat famous and travel around the world and he will think she is cheating on him all the time. He might even be right on occasion given Megan's sense of independence. And then I think he will end up assaulting her or killing someone he thinks she's cheating with. 

Thoughts? Each episode has a had a moment that is pure gold, but that elevator thing was the best moment of the season. Reminds me of season 5 of the Sopranos with the dream sequence except this wasn't a dream. So creepy/awesome."	t5_2r7l7	True

So I felt like this episode, especially the latter half, was similar to ""The Suitcase"" in the huge burst of development it provided for Don. Not only does it focus a lot on young Dick Whitman, but it details his first sexual encounter with the whore which mirrors Don's current need for warmth from Sylvia (both have moles on their right cheeks, similar hair). The speed he takes sends him on a collision course with his past and eventually allows him to see how it's making him function today, and the crash from the drug at the end is coupled by the danger he finds his children to have escaped from. Almost immediately in the next scene with in bed with Megan it seems like he's seeing his life clearly for the first time in a while, and almost immediately he moves on from needing Sylvia in the last elevator scene.
the line at the end of the episode quoted above worked for me really well. I thought it not only encapsulated the episode perfectly but, like Don said in his office with Ginsberg and Peggy, was about something much bigger than an ad campaign- it was about his life and identity. Don saying ""whorehouse"" out loud without any hesitation may in fact be a huge step forward for his character acknowledging his past life and trauma in childhood, especially as it helped move on from Sylvia and take responsibility for the actions in his life (him telling Sally at the end that he left the door open and it was ""his fault"").

asides: 1) the opening of the episode was flawless and in terms of tone it immediately put you into the front seat of a new car late at night with drunk people all around you, blocking your eyes with their hands, rendering you incapable of seeing what was coming and your very life in danger. mad men's never done anything like that to start an episode that i can remember and the rest of the episode delivered after that

2) there's also a really great symbol which i know tied in; i neglected to talk about the i-ching, also known as the ""Book of Changes"" and the girl who played the questions games, her telling don that his question was ""does anybody love me"" really helped him find what he was looking for this ep"	t5_2r7l7	True

When Don is pitching the Carousel in season 1, he talks a lot about tapping into nostalgia, and shows off pictures of his ""happy"" family. Thew viewers all know, though, that Don's family life is not as perfect as the pictures show, and then we see Don go on to make bad decisions that are partly responsible for the end of his marriage. 

It was pretty interesting to me that our second viewing of the Carousel felt really similar. There's a lot of a kind of nostalgia as they look back at the Draper's (albeit very recent) vacation, showing happy times with Don and Megan. They're the perfect couple. But then we see that Don's sleeping with the doctor's wife, and we all feel a sense of ""same old Don"".

1334560483.0	sc2xf	I know everyone hates Pete but..	Wilson_the_Vollyball	96	10	40	"The elevator scene, where he stifles back tears, and then at the end where Handsome is feeling up the girl's leg.. it kind of broke my heart. 

Pete can be a prissy bitch, but he's always been more complex than that. . He is never satisfied because of his ambitions, which I think stems from daddy issues. Whatever he could accomplish, he's never been good enough for his father. His perception of what he wants compared to what will actually make him happy is skewed as well, and I think he is starting to realize this. But the allusion to Pete's gun and overall insatiability with life seems to foreshadow a pretty dark path for him ahead. 

I loved the whole episode, but it cinched it for me when it faded out from Pete hearing the water droplets. 
It was like the itch at the back of his mind reminding him of his extremely ordinary existence. He's no Don Draper who can fix sinks like ~superman~. Pete just wants to be happy and doesn't know how, I think.

At any rate, when Don calls Sally to allay her fears that he had a heart attack, I felt this crushing feeling right in my sternum right when she tells him she asked ""Grandma Ida"" as many questions as she could but she just doesn't know anything about him.

The duality of the defensiveness and the resignation in her tone makes me think that she only realized AS she was saying it just how much of a stranger her father really is to her, and I found that honestly devastating. 

Seeing as the dynamic between Don and women has been a recurring theme explored in this season, I thought the inclusion of his fragile relatioship with his only daughter was a tender and disheartening addition to the exploration of Don's inner tumult.
