1374089418.0	1ii8ru	ELI5 has defaulted!	anonymous123421	7133	4554	453	"We were informed yesterday by the reddit admins that they had selected ELI5 to be a default! This is incredibly exciting, and it means that we are about to experience some real changes. However, despite the changes (which I'll mention below), we will still continue to stay true to the ELI5 community.

Before I proceed, I'd like to just say how humbled I am to be a part of such a great community that is now a default sub! I think I speak for all the mods and faithful subscribers when I say that it is quite frankly unbelievable.

***

**Changes**

1. **We will be inundated with new users.** They will not understand how ELI5 works. It is the responsibility of all of us who know that ELI5 is for *layman-friendly explanations and questions that prompt those explanations* to spread that message to the newcomers. We will work on enhancing the sidebar both contentwise and aesthetically to make it easier to understand.

2. **Moderation may be a bit stricter.** We will have many more trolls and spammers. Please use that report button, and message the mods using the sidebar link with a link to anything you see! Expect reposts for a little while, and just learn to deal with them. If it's something that's been asked once or twice recently, then let us know and we'll handle it. But if it's a question that was asked a few months ago, just move on or link OP to a good explanation from the past.

3. **We will be adding more moderators.** ***DO NOT APPLY TO BE A MODERATOR IN THIS THREAD.*** It's a long, pain-in-the-ass process that likely won't even be open, so please do not inquire about it. In all likelihood, we will approach users who have and continue to 1) report spam to us via modmail and 2) post quality content on the subreddit. One of those moderators will be automoderator.

As always, thanks to all of you who visit, or who even subscribed voluntarily! And welcome to everyone new.

So why are we flooding the sub with simple knowledge questions? This sub is for explaining the Higgs Boson or the effect of black holes on the passage of time, not telling why we say ""shotgun"" when we want the passenger seat in a car.

**EDIT:** Alright, I thought my example would have been sufficient, but it's clear that I need to explain a little.

My problem is that questions are being asked where **there is no difference between an expert answer and a layman answer.** In keeping with the shotgun example, that holds true-- People call the front passenger seat by saying 'shotgun' because, in the ages of horses and carts, the person sitting next to the one driving the horses was the one armed to protect the wagon. There is no way for that explanation to be any more simple or complex than it already is.

Also, for those who are saying ""Don't forget to factor in the cost of internet"", my response is that I had broadband internet a long time before Netflix even existed - a long time before you could even watch TV on a computer in any practical way.

I understand that they need to advertise new products, but oftentimes, it's not a new product featured in a TV commercial.

The big soda companies are the best example I can think of.

90% of the time I see this comment, it doesn't, and for a few reasons.

1. Pretty much every ""superficial"" topic or question can spawn deep conversation.

2. For /r/askscience, there's a reason people don't always post there. If they want a simple answer to a science question, ELI5 is a great place.

3. ""Google it."" Why? Just because there's information to be found doesn't mean OP necessarily knows what to read or believe. A lot of times, there are cultural differences or other reasons OP is posting here. Do you people seriously think it's lazy to type up a post here rather than look it up? I didn't realize attempting to become informed on an issue was considered ""lazy.""

4. **It's not about OP.** The beauty of ELI5 is that, while OP gets his/her question answered, the subscribers see (and contribute to) discussions about topics *they would never think to even ask*. That is what makes this subreddit great.

So please, cut it out with the ""this belongs in /r/answers"" comments. **If you *really* think it does, report the post and message the mods with a link to it and your reasoning. And please, don't abuse that.**

That's what I'm looking for here, just a few succinct sentences about the more important countries/cities/areas.

 Like, I know Nigeria is the biggest in terms of population and is considered an important up-and-coming economy due in part to oil revenues, but mired in conflict by the North/South religious divide, scandal and corruption, all of which threatens to tear the country apart.


And please don't say ""all the countries are important,"" because like States, that's not true.  That's not to say they don't have value, but I mean more in terms of continental (or global) social/political/economic issues.

Edit: What I'm trying to get at is that if Country A has, say, $-10, as well as Countries B and C because they are all in debt, then the world has $-30, which seems impossible, so who has the $30?

Edit 2: Thanks for all the responses (and the front page)! Really clears things up for me. Trying to read through all the responses because apparently there is not nearly as concrete of an answer as I thought there would be. Also, if anyone isn't satisfied by the top answers, dig a little deeper. There are some quality explanations that have been buried.

Edit 3: I think that a lot of you are over-complicating this question. Although the history and logistics of economics is really interesting and I have learned a lot about it from your responses, I feel like there is a lot of unnecessary information here. Here are the responses that I feel like answer this question best. It may be that none of these are right and it may be that all of them are (it seems like the answer to this question is a combination of things), but here are the top 3 answers (sorry if this oversimplifies things):

1)	Even though all of the governments are in debt, they are all in debt to each other, so the money works out. If they were all to somehow simultaneously pay each other back, the money would hypothetically even out, but this is both impossible and impractical.

2)	Money is actually created through inflation and interest, so there is more money on earth that there is value because interest creates money out of nowhere. 

3)	For the most part, countries do not owe each other but their citizens and various banks. So the banks and people have the money and the government itself is in debt. Therefore, every country‚Äôs government can be in debt because they owe the banks, which are in surplus.

If you look at the front page now, there are really not too many posts that require the lens of a 5 year old. Rather, they are simple questions that require simple answers. They are not logically complex questions, that would require a simplified solution for the layman. 

Some examples:
Hello i'm from Argentina, can someone explain why a black guy eating a watermelon is racist?

ELI5: How Apple can publicly claim iPhone 5 is the thinnest smartphone in the world?

ELI5: Why can places like Newegg ship UPS for free when it costs regular people so much money?

ELI5: The Obama Birther Issue

Explain like I'm 5 why the states with the highest average income, health metrics, and education levels are also the most liberal and nobody ever talks about it.


Do these type of questions benefit from being described to a 5 year old? These are questions with pretty straightforward answers, and while they may not be suitable for a child, I think it's a waste of real estate in this subreddit when these questions would be much better directed in appropriate /r/ask subreddits. 

I would think we should be seeing more posts like ""Why do we stretch and why does it feel good when we do?""

The actual answer probably requires some biology and science knowledge of anatomy, and benefits from having it's explanation suited for 5 year old. 

Also - if you check the number of ""Answered"" in this subreddit, it's not a high percentage. I think this because the questions are not worthy of a ELI5 explanation.

I think we need to have more ""big issue"" posts, topic posts. EG - ELI5 - The Housing Bubble... or ELI5 Computer Languages

Check this out:
http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j86h2/the_fiveyearolds_guide_to_the_galaxy/

This subreddit should be an ever-expanding version of this, right? Instead, we are bloated with a ton of posts that don't require ELI5, and it's ruining the creativity and unique edge this subreddit used to have.


Can we band together and downvote questions that don't really require ELI5 and upvote ones that would make for an engaging answer?
I hope so. 

Don't mean to come off negatively, I just want to see this subreddit return to domincance as an intriguing and enlightening subreddit. Not one filled with questions that probably belong in /r/politics or /r/technology or most appropriately /r/askreddit.

1354625097.0	149cqc	[meta] A friendly reminder	anonymous123421	2318	737	238	"Hey everyone!

We'd just like to remind ELI5 that this is *explain to a layman*, **not** explain *to* a five-year-old. Some people like to address OP as ""little Johnny"" or overtly say things like ""when you're old enough"" or ""ask your mommy.""

We get that this is called explain like im five. And the answers are great. But while some people find it amusing or cute, to be honest it gets stale really quick and to many is very patronizing. We all know that the people here aren't actually five-- when they are OP usually says ""from my five year old!"" We're not into roleplaying here.

To be clear: we won't be removing these explanations. We're not in the business of needless censorship and we don't want to remove otherwise great explanations. Just please refrain from these posts. Nobody posts a legitimate question here because they want to be talked down to. Just answer the question as if OP is not an expert in the field but has a basic understanding of logic and basic things. Generally you can tell by the question where to start. If OP asks about what molecules are, you'd start with the basics of atoms and matter. But if they ask about the half life of uranium, you don't need to start describing that atoms are made of protons, neutrons and electrons, and that they're very small.

Thanks everyone, and keep up the great responses!"	t5_2sokd	True
1334352979.0	s8l4e	[Meta] I think people are forgetting what /r/explainlikeimfive is for.	TheYeIIowDucK	2745	1161	160	"It used to be just a minor annoyance but now it's getting to the point where about 75% of all ELI5 posts reaching the front page are better suited to be on [/r/askreddit](/r/askreddit) or /r/answers, or sometimes even [/r/askscience](/r/askscience). Seeing how [/r/explainlikeimfive](/r/explainlikeimfive) has recently reached 100k readers, I think it's time to address this issue.

It seems like people are taking advantage of ELI5 more laid-back attitude and small-yet-noticeable subscription count to post questions that would never see the light of day on other subreddit. This subreddit's purpose is to be, as the sidebar states:

&gt;A friendly place to ask questions and get elementary school-level answers, without fear of judgement.

Take note of what kind of posts used to reach ELI5's front page during its early days:

* [Why is x^0 = 1?](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j8wmr/eli5_why_is_x01/)

* [How do Trust Funds actually work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j7nxt/explain_to_me_how_trust_funds_actually_work/)

* [How does HTTP work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j393m/can_someone_explain_http_like_im_five/)

* [What is fire and how does it work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j4xq2/what_is_fire_and_how_does_it_work/)

###Notice how each of these posts is a **complex subject or question**, and how many of the comment ***literally* make the answer simple enough for a five year old to understand**.

Now let's take a look at what has reached the ELI5 front page over the last week:

* [Why doesn't Reddit simply hire the guy who makes Reddit Enhancement Suite \(RES\) and make those features part of Reddit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s4iun/eli5_why_doesnt_reddit_simply_hire_the_guy_who/)

* [How is downloading movies/books online any different than going to your local library to check out movies/books for free?](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s0rih/eli5_how_is_downloading_moviesbooks_online_any/)

* [Why some of my friends think Che Guevera is a hero, and others say he is a bad dude?](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s2a2k/eli5_why_some_of_my_friends_think_che_guevera_is/)

* [Why do British people sound American when they sing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/rxybc/eli5_why_do_british_people_sound_american_when/)

### None of these posts is complex nor addresses anything that requires explaining. Much of the posts are suggestive or simply provocative, and ALL of them would fit better in other subreddits. The answers to these posts are never fit for 5 year olds, and are no different from [/r/Askreddit](/r/Askreddit) answers.

The subreddit has lost its way.

I understand that the admins here want to make the community in charge of what reaches the front page and what gets filtered out, but sometimes forced, strict moderating is what you have to do. 

No need to go all the way into the no-memes-or-any-kind-of-fun zone where [/r/askscience](/r/askscience) lies, but letting stagnation, new redditors and circlejerkers take over isn't the answer either (See [/r/atheism](/r/atheism), [/r/classicrage](/r/classicrage), /r/gaming or what [/r/circlejerk](/r/circlejerk) used to be a mere month ago).

So please admins, if this post tries to say anything is that you should have stricter rules about which submissions should and should not go on [/r/explainlikeimfive](/r/explainlikeimfive). Be a little bit more delete-happy, and try to make the subreddit more like [the great video found in the sidebar.](http://vimeo.com/27060669)"	t5_2sokd	True

BrinkMoney	2648	1121	405	"I think it would be a safe assumption that being a productive, hard working individual is advantageous from an evolutionary perspective. You can tell we are programmed as such since after a hard workout at the gym or nailing a big presentation at work our brain's reward system tells us we did a good job and releases endorphins/dopamine/whatever. That being said...why do I have no other desire than to lounge around with a pizza and a blanket and watch Netflix all day? And isn't it interesting that when you do that, later on you typically feel bad about the fact that you weren't productive and sat on your ass all day?

Busting my ass and doing great things gives me such greater pleasure than being lazy, but being lazy always seems like a much better option than busting my ass. Scumbag brain.

EDIT: Look I understand that biologically we are wired to conserve energy...but that doesn't explain the cognitive dissonance in my brain where it tells me to be lazy but at the same time beats me up for doing so.

EDIT 2: I think all i've learned from this debate is that I have a fundamentally flawed understanding of evolution. Hahaha

EDIT 3: And the lightbulb finally went off. I get what everyone is saying now I think. So if i'm understanding everything right, the means to propagating our genes ARE hard coded into our DNA, but that hard coding tells us to be lazy as a result of millions of years of evolution as opposed to few thousands of years of living in civilized society that probably had little to no effect on our genetic makeup.

I think what I was trying to say was that evolution has been favorable to those who are adaptable, and those who can adapt to our current society the best will reap the most rewards, allowing most potential to propagate our genes.

FirstToAdmitIt	2200	784	253	"Reddit seems to usually support the notion that American's ideals of beauty are heavily influenced by the images and scenarios we see in the media, so much so that much of our behavior is impacted by the desire to conform to these standards. But reddit is very skeptical that violent images and scenarios in the media influence how Americans react to confrontation.

Am I incorrectly lumping the proponents of these two views together? Or is there a simple, consistent way to hold both these views at the same time?

EDIT: The question was very broad, so I apologize. Many people are assuming I am referring to spree killings or mass-shootings when I talk about violence, which is understandable because those are the incidents that cause this debate to resurface. However, I had more ""common"" violence in mind; gang violence, fights over women, domestic violence; Castle Doctrine inspired by ""No Duty to Retreat""-style country westerns; vigilante justice in the style of Charles Bronson's ""Death Wish."""	t5_2sokd	True

I'm not taking ELI5 very literally, so I don't think answers have to make sense to a *five* year old, but just have to be simple in general. 

A lot of questions I see here don't need to be answered like someone's five. Answers that anybody might give would be simple enough without asking here for further simplifications. For example, Dolan. It's a sick twist on Disney comics. There. Was that so hard? I'm sure you would have gotten that answer on r/Answers or r/AskReddit had you not asked here.

People put the ELI5 tag without realizing its significance. Let's start with the word 'explain'. Explaining is not the same thing as answering. Explaining is taking something and making it simple. Answering is not necessarily the same thing. It's giving a response to an answer, and it's up to the answerer to see if that answer is simple or not.

There are a lot of good subreddits out there that you really need to check out.

If you want scientific answers, go to r/AskScience. People there are more knowledgeable in science. If you don't understand their answer, ask them to simplify it. I'm sure that they'd be willing to do that.

Also, please use the resources available to you. If you need help on a homework, your teachers, professors, or TA are your best sources for help. Also, a lot of the stuff you ask are far too broad to be answered here. For example, someone asked the history of Russia from 1990 on. You really can't explain that here. That would at least take a chapter from a good sized book.

When you bring an already correct answer it makes it much easier to figure out what level of understanding you are seeking It also helps to make sure you are getting the answer to a question that you had *intended* to ask and not just the question as you phrased it. 

**EDIT:** I like the suggestion of not downvoting correct responses. In order to effectively explain a concept to someone else you need two things. 

(1) Correct answers to begin with.  
(2) Great explanations of those correct answers.

So I would not initially up vote a correct answer, but if it leads to a great explanation, then I would go back and up vote the parent to make sure the pair, a correct answer and a great explanation, rise to the top.    

**EDIT 2:** Imagine you are reading a textbook or assignment on say mitosis and the material you are supposed to be learning is hard to understand. Instead of just posting ""What is mitosis"" you post ""can someone help me with this explanation of mitosis?""

----

As I'm sure you already know, this subreddit is by far the quickest-growing in reddit's history, and is already in the top 100 on the entire site.  However, with our rapidly growing size we'll need to be extra careful that we head in the right direction.

**Most importantly, remember the name of the subreddit.** This is for legitimately elementary school-level explanations. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j2epj/could_someone_please_explain_wikileaks/c28lbyd) is a wonderful example. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j350s/can_you_explain_the_difference_between_a/c28qks2), on the other hand, is something we should steer clear of (no offense to Nebula42; it's very informative but you'd be hard-pressed to find a five-year-old who can understand it).  Some topics are very difficult to explain on a low level, but keep in mind the Einstein quote above.

**Our other policies will be opened now for public discussion.** We want to create an environment of friendly collaboration, so instead of making unilateral decisions we're going to propose a number of options for this /r/ and see what the popular opinion is.

 * **The ability to mark your question as answered.** If we implement this, by responding to a post with some keyphrase (""thank you"" or something similar) you will trigger a CSS bot to mark your post with a check, letting other users know immediately that the post has been answered. *To ensure that we stay on an elementary school level, you would only mark an answer as sufficient if you really and truly believe it is simple enough for an elementary school student.* Alternatively, we could have a panel of mods decide if an answer is good and apply checks accordingly.  Discuss.

 * **A way to distinguish between actual questions and other posts.** Administrative posts, suggestions for the /r/, and other submissions not actually looking for an explanation could be somehow distinguished (I suggest by having the link color of non-question posts be faded). This would require having a keyword (LI5 or ELI5) in the question posts so they are easily distinguished.  This also means users will be forced to use LI5 or ELI5 or their post will be miscategorized. Discuss.

 * **User tags for users who consistently give good answers.**  Similar to something r/askscience has, we'd like to give tags to users who repeatedly give educated and, more importantly, *simple* explanations of complicated topics.  The how, when, and what are less clear.  Discuss.

 * **Removing comments which add nothing.**  I would personally like to see fewer comments like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j2epj/could_someone_please_explain_wikileaks/c28mfg2) in this subreddit. I feel it clogs threads and takes focus away from responders who have something to add (like [this response to the same parent comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j2epj/could_someone_please_explain_wikileaks/c28ng44)).  I would support reporting/removing comments which add nothing, but again ‚Äì¬†this thread is for public discussion of policies.

We hope this subreddit will continue to grow in a positive and fruitful direction, and we can't do it without your help in guiding it.  Please discuss any of the above topics in the comment section!

I assume they form under stress, but why do they stay formed for long periods of time? 	400stars	1491	440	277	"**Edit:** I'm sorry I didn't follow the posting guidelines. The title should have read as follows: ELI5 - What exactly are muscle knots? I assume they form under stress, but why do they stay formed for long periods of time? 

**Edit 2:** Thank all of you for your responses and answers!! For some reason, the most highly voted answer has been deleted. I pasted a copy of that text below. **(Shout out to chaveza94!)**

**From chaveza94 -** This is what the top comment that has now been deleted said: ""Muscle knots are tiny automatic splints that form in muscles where you have tears. Here's what's going on. Your muscles (with the exception of your tongue), can only do two things: contract, and stop contracting. When you move your arm, the muscle contracts, when you move it back the muscle that moved it first stops resisting, and lets the other muscle move it back. When one of your muscles is damaged and gets a tiny tear in it, it tries to keep the tear from getting worse by clenching down around the tear. The muscle stays like that until the tear is healed (usually takes a day or two, muscles heal extremely fast). Well... Now we have a problem... Remember how your muscles can only contract? Well... now you have that splint clenched as hard as it can, and it's stopped contracting, but we have become a lazy and indolent species, and while normally our natural movement would cause the splint to be relaxed out, now it stays... and hurts. We call these knots, because they feel like knots tied in a rope. Knots! Have very little to do with stress... But there is another kind of nasty muscle pain that is often misrepresented as a ""knot"". This is the Fascial Adhesion. If you are under stress, this is probably what you are feeling. Here's what happens... All of your body is covered in a thin sheath of material called Fascia, every cell, is covered in it, it's what gives you your shape. Well muscle fibers covered in the stuff move within it back and forth. In places where your body doesn't need to move the muscle, so much as have it remain in place and strong, the fibers die out and the fascia bonds together. This happens normally, and it results in a tendon. This is perfectly normal... up to a point. When you are stressed you have a tendency to bunch up muscles and keep them that way. After a while the muscle fibers throw in the towel, and signal to the body that they are not really a muscle (biologically expensive) and could be replaced by a tendon (biologically inexpensive), and the fascia starts to bond together. This causes ""muscle tightness"" and frankly, hurts. If you get a massage and it hurts like someone took a hot knife through your muscles? It's the Fascial Adhesion breaking apart. Solution: To both knots and fascial adhesions are the same. Get a massage to deal with the knots and adhesions you have now, and move more to keep from getting them again. Seriously. Yoga.

1355852266.0	152674	[ELI5] Why do American wall plates for switches use Flathead screws instead of Philips? Why do we use Flathead screws for anything?	xnoybis	1532	483	412	"First, I hate Flathead screws for what I believe are self-evident reasons.

Second, I don't understand why switches mount with Phillips or combination Flathead-Phillips, but the plates mount with Flatheads.

After researching screws (no kidding) on Wikipedia, I've determined that there is a really interesting history of screws, but no explanation for why we still use Flathead screws.

EDIT: Excellent feedback. I accidentally clicked on the exclamation mark - I don't think the question has been answered by a long shot. It remains open, and weird. 

1) Aesthetics are largely subjective; to say that a line is more aesthetically pleasing than a star, hex, triangle, square,or any of the other screw drive types ([longer list here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw#Types_of_screw_drives)) is a bit of a stretch. 

2) As far as being less noticeable, I disagree. A Spanner head or Robertson would look pleasing on a wall plate. 

3) As for paint issues, no one that I know spray's on wall plates - you remove these before painting, or tape over them. 

4) Lastly, as far as concerns of stripping bolts go, multiple individuals have pointed out the utility of Robertson heads; the inability to strip them because you have a limited number of drivers, unlike philips.

As for myself, I use torque / torx heads or Robertson when I can, tolerate Phillips, and continue to grit my teeth when using Flathead screws.

EDIT2: **eelnitsud** provides the following succinct reasoning:

&gt;A flat head screw is used when a higher amount of torque is needed. It's shape allows it to be tightened tighter without the tool slipping. A philips head screw is used to prevent overtightening by allowing the tool to slip when a certain tention is reached. Flat head screws have been around much longer than power tools. - source: electrical trade school."	t5_2sokd	True

**[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vrt9x/obamacare_pointbypoint/) is Part 1 of the Point-By-Point**

.

As I said before, this is a huge undertaking. The [current version of the bill](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf) is 974 pages long, and I'm going through it bit by bit. But it's going to take a while to do it. I'll keep adding to this until I'm finished, but given that I have a job and a social life, I can't say how long it'll take.

Also, I'll try to address questions people have as best I can, but again, it might take me a while to get back to you. Please be patient.

So, without further ado, here goes...

(**Note: I am NOT an expert! I'm just a guy. If I have made an error on any of this, please let me know!**)

(**Note: For the sake of clarity and continuity, any references to page numbers will be referring to the PDF file, not the page number in the document**)

**[Page 198, Sec. 2001](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=198)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting in 2014, everyone up to 133% of the poverty line is covered by Medicaid. From what I can tell, looking at the Social Security Act, it looks like it's currently a mishmesh of various qualifications, one being that a person is under 100% of the poverty line. So this will make for a pretty huge number of people who Medicaid grows to encompass. This section also increases federal funding to support the increase. However, it should be mentioned that a [recent court ruling](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf), amongst other things, made it clear that individual states could opt not to do this. However, in Justice Roberts' opinion ""Congress may offer the States grants and require the States to comply with accompanying conditions, but the States must have a genuine choice whether to accept the offer."", so in other words, States can't be forced to do this, but they can be given incentives to do this.

**[Page 210, Sec. 2004](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=210)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting in 2014, Medicaid covers former foster children under the age of 26.

**[Page 210, Sec. 2005](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=210)** - Increases the amount of Medicare money given to US Territories like Puerto Rico.

**[Page 211, Sec. 2006](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=211)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. It looks like what it's doing is that starting in 2011, the amount of money the Federal Government chips in for medical care when there is a major disaster increases.

**[Page 212, Sec. 2007](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=212)** - Between 2014 and 2018, this cuts about $700,000,000 from a part of Medicaid called the Medicaid Improvement Fund, a yearly fund established to improve the management of Medicaid. Clearly, this was done to help fund this bill, which itself tries to improve Medicaid (along with everything else).

**[Page 213, Sec. 2101](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=213)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that Between October 2005 and September 2009, the amount of money allocated to the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) increases, and this section says that states that want to get this increased funding need to make sure that the health insurance provided under CHIP meets the same standards as those in this bill.

**[Page 216, Sec. 2102](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=216)** - Alters two other bills, the Social Security Act, and the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA). It looks like it's just coordinating everything so it all makes sense together.

**[Page 217, Sec. 2201](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=217)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, by adding the following section.

**[Page 217, Sec. 1943](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=217)** - This calls for the creation of a website for people who use Medicaid and CHIP to sign up for and renew insurance plans using their state's insurance exchanges.

**[Page 219, Sec. 2202](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=219)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. From what I can tell, it looks like this allows a hospital to choose whether they want to be able to make a determination whether or not a patient is covered under Medicaid. I'm just guessing here, but I think that this is to streamline things and make it easier for hospitals to sign patients up for Medicaid if a patient looks like they might qualify for Medicaid.
 
**[Page 220, Sec. 2301](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=220)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to allow Medicaid to cover ""Freestanding Birth Centers"", which look like they are essentially an establishment which is *not* a hospital, but which provides services to mothers giving birth. So... picture a maternity ward without the rest of the hospital, and that seems like the sort of thing they're describing.
 
**[Page 221, Sec. 2302](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=221)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to say that if a child has been diagnosed with a terminal illness, and the parents have chosen to pay for hospice care, that paying for hospice care doesn't mean that they are giving up any other forms of care that Medicaid and CHIP might provide for their child as well.

**[Page 222, Sec. 2303](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=222)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to provide those with a low income (an amount which is to be decided by each State) access to family planning medical services. From what I can tell, this means stuff like STD testing, contraceptives, etc.

Okay, it looks like a lot of the stuff coming up pertains to long-term care - for people who are bedridden and need medical supervision, people who are in a nursing home or have an in-home caregiver, etc.

**[Page 225, Sec. 2304](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=225)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to clarify the wording of one part.

**[Page 225, Sec. 2401](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=225)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that beginning in October 2011, states may provide those with an income level under 150% of the poverty line (which, like I said in Part 1, is based on your age and how many people are in your household) care in a nursing home, in-home care, etc. It looks like this section is optional for States to follow, but those that choose to do it (and follow numerous standards set in place by this section) will benefit from an increase in Federal funding.

**[Page 230, Sec. 2402](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=230)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create regulations for various types of state-provided long-term care (again, stuff like nursing homes and in-home care), allowing states to cater to those who could benefit from different kinds of long-term care while still working within pre-set standards.

**[Page 233, Sec. 2403](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=233)** - Alters another bill, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. Reading around on this, it looks like this has to do with states funding long-term care, and transitioning into and out of hospitals (as opposed to nursing homes and in-home care). The Deficit Reduction Act had a part to smooth this transition, and this section extends that part, as well as expanding the people it can cover (based on how long a person has been receiving long-term care).

**[Page 234, Sec. 2404](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=234)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. It's hard to parse through this one, since it bounces around to different sections of the Social Security Act, but the gist of it seems to deal with a part of the Social Security Act that happens when your spouse becomes institutionalized in some form of long-term care, and the state helps with your expenses during that time (because long-term medical care can be costly). This section seems to make it so that from 2014-2019, this help also includes medical coverage.

**[Page 234, Sec. 2405](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=234)** - Sets aside $50,000,000 (over a five-year period) to help pay for another bill, the Older Americans Act of 1965.

**[Page 234, Sec. 2406](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=234)** - This is basically the bill talking about how important a topic long-term care is, and saying in a general way that Congress should talk about it more and that more support should be made for community-level care (like nursing homes and in-home care) as opposed to only hospital care.

**[Page 235, Sec. 2501](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=235)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to increase the size of the drug rebates poor people get through Medicaid, and also to specify that no rebates are to be for an amount *higher* than the average price of the drug.

**[Page 238, Sec. 2502](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=238)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to allow Medicaid to cover more types of drugs, including Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, and drugs that help people to quit smoking.

**[Page 239, Sec. 2503](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=239)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. It looks like this sets a way to determine what the limits are for how much Medicaid is supposed to reimburse people for pharmacy drugs.

**[Page 242, Sec. 2551](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=242)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. This one is cutting a lot of money from payments made to states called Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) Payments. These are payments that states then turn over to hospitals to help compensate them for treating emergency patients who don't have insurance. Clearly the idea is that since more patients will have insurance after the PPACA goes into full swing, hospitals won't need as much of these funds. From 2014-2020, $18.1 Billion will be cut from the amount given to states for this, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services is to decide how much each state gets cut based on what percentage of their population is insured, as well as a few other factors.

**[Page 243, Sec. 2601](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=243)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. I'm not entirely sure about this, because it's hard to find information on it, but it looks like it gives states the option to get 5-10-year waivers so they don't have to follow Federal regulations for Medicaid when it comes to ""Demonstration Projects"" (Look farther down to see some of these), which looks like they are ways to test out new alternate approaches to Medicaid. However, the Secretary of Health and Human Resources can pull the plug on these waivers if it looks like a Demonstration Project isn't working the way it is intended.

**[Page 244, Sec. 2602](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=244)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to create the [Federal Coordinated Health Care Office](https://www.cms.gov/About-CMS/Agency-Information/CMSLeadership/Office_FCHCO.html), which is in charge of managing the areas of overlap between Medicare and Medicaid, to make it more effective and efficient for people who qualify for both to get the services they're covered for, and make sure there's not any waste.

**[Page 246, Sec. 2701](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=246)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 246, Sec. 1139B](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=246)** - On a yearly basis from 2011-2014, and then every three years after 2014, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is to write a report on recommended standards for adult care for Medicaid patients, much like a similar report that's already written for children. This section also calls for the establishment of the Medicaid Quality Measurement Program to develop and test better methods of adult care (again, like a similar program already in existence for children). $60 Million will be set aside every year from 2010-2014 to fund this program.

**[Page 248, Sec. 2702](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=248)** - From what I can tell, this part directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to look at individual state practices that withhold payment from hospitals for health conditions caused by the hospitals' own neglect and negligence, and adopt them as general Medicaid practices.

**[Page 248, Sec. 2703](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=248)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting in 2011, states may choose to offer medical plans for those with chronic conditions that they're calling a ""Health Home"", which appears to be a phrase that doesn't mean what it seems to. A ""Health Home"" doesn't seem to be an actual ""home"" per se, but more like a team of specialists assigned to look after you and coordinate your care.

**[Page 252, Sec. 2704](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=252)** - From 2012-2016, the Secretary of Health and Human Resources will start up one of those ""Demonstration Projects"" I mentioned earlier to test the effectiveness of doing bundled programs in Medicaid.

**[Page 254, Sec. 2705](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=254)** -  From 2010-2012,The Secretary of Health and Human Resources will start up another one of those ""Demonstration Projects"" to give participating States an option to try out a different Medicaid payment structure for hospitals, so instead of paying hospitals based on the quantity of service they give, it's based on the quality.

**[Page 255, Sec. 2706](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=255)** - From 2012-2016, The Secretary of Health and Human Resources will start up another one of those ""Demonstration Projects"". This one gives states the opportunity to allow hospitals to become ""Pediatric Accountable Care Organization"", which looks like it's a way to reward Pediatric hospitals who find ways of saving money without reducing the amount of care patients receive.

**[Page 256, Sec. 2707](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=256)** - The Secretary of Health and Human Resources will start up another ""Demonstration Project"". This one gives states the opportunity to allow private psychiatric hospitals to be covered under Medicaid. This section allocates $75 Million for this, and specifies that it will be a three-year project that will happen sometime between 2011 and 2015.

**[Page 258, Sec. 2801](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=258)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to try to improve MACPAC, which looks like it handles Medicaid and CHIP payments. This section clarifies wording, emphasizes efficiency and preventive care, and adds in a bunch of directions to communicate more clearly and frequently with Congress and the states, as well as coordinating with MedPAC, which handles Medicare payments. It also allocates $9 Million for this in 2010, as well as reallocating $2 Million from Social Security for this (out of $12 Billion that year - so comparatively speaking not much).

**[Page 263, Sec. 2901](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=263)** - Goes into more detail on some rules regarding Native American Indians and the Indian Health Service.

**[Page 263, Sec. 2902](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=263)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that a reimbursement to Native American Indian hospitals under Medicare Part B, previously due to expire in 2010, will continue on.

**[Page 264, Sec. 2951](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=264)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 264, Sec. 511](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=264)** - 6 months after the bill passes, all states must conduct a ""statewide needs assessment"" to identify communities with high levels of crime, poverty, etc., how good state programs are at providing at-home medical visits for children, and the effectiveness of substance abuse treatment programs. States are report this information to the Secretary of Health and Human Resources, as well as informing the Secretary of what they intend to do to improve the situation in their state. This section authorizes the Secretary to make grants to states for these improvements (with an emphasis on communities in particularly bad shape), and directs the Secretary to track the improvements made after 3-5 years. This section also directs the Secretary to coordinate these efforts with the Maternal and Child Health Bureau and the Administration for Children and Families. From 2010-2014, $1.5 Billion is set aside for this section.

**[Page 274, Sec. 2952](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=274)** - Directs the Director of the National Institute of Mental
Health to conduct a study on postpartum depression, and alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 275, Sec. 512](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=275)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to use grant money for projects to diagnose and treat postpartum depression. The Secretary is to track the progress of these projects and report to Congress on the results. $3 Million is set aside for this in 2010, and ""sums as may be necessary"" in 2011 and 2012.

**[Page 277, Sec. 2953](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=277)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 277, Sec. 513](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=277)** - From 2010-2014, the Secretary of Health and Human Resources will give each state funding (based on the size of that state's population between ages 10-19) for sex education programs (pushing both abstinence *and* contraception). $375 Million is to be set aside for this from 2010-2014, with some of that specifically set aside for youths who are homeless, have AIDS, live in areas with high youth birth rates, etc. Along with this, there are calls for studies to see how effective these programs are in reducing youth pregnancy rates.

**[Page 282, Sec. 2954](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=282)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to reinstate funding for abstinence-only sex education programs from 2010-2014.

**[Page 283, Sec. 2955](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=283)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting in 2010, children without a parent (or who don't want their parents to be in charge of their medical decisions) are given more information about the importance of designating a Power of Attorney when it looks like they may need one to make medical decisions for them.

**[Page 285, Sec. 3001](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=285)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting in 2013, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a ""hospital value-based purchasing program"" so that instead of reimbursing hospitals based on the number of patients they have treated, they are reimbursed based on their success with a measure of specific conditions (heart failure, pneumonia, acute myocardial infarction), surgeries, and stuff like negligence. These measures are to take into account stuff like age, sex, race, severity of illness, etc., as well as the hospitals' prior success with these conditions, how much they've improved, and how they compare to other hospitals.

**[Page 296, Sec. 3002](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=296)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to extend a program called the Physician Quality Reporting System, which offers an increase in pay as an incentive to doctors to report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services about the quality measures taken in their hospital. This amount decreases in 2012, and ends in 2015. Starting in 2015, doctors who *fail* to make these reports will have their pay reduced, and in 2016 it will be reduced even further.

**[Page 298, Sec. 3003](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=298)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, starting in 2012, to use claims data (and possibly other data) to give doctors information about resources and methods available to them to improve care for their patients.

**[Page 301, Sec. 3004](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=301)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to make it so that starting in 2014, long-term care hospitals that fail to report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services about the quality measures taken in their hospital will receive reduced funding.

**[Page 304, Sec. 3005](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=304)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to direct ""PPS-Exempt Cancer Hospitals"", beginning in 2014, to report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services about the quality measures taken in their hospital.

**[Page 305, Sec. 3006](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=305)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a ""value-based purchasing plan"" in Medicare for ""skilled nursing facilities"", ""home health agencies"" and ""ambulatory surgical centers"", to make the pay they get under Medicare to be based on the quality of care they give based on criteria to be determined by the Secretary. These plans were to be presented to Congress throughout 2011.

**[Page 307, Sec. 3007](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=307)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to come up with a ""value-based payment modifier"" to begin in 2013, which will pay doctors based on the quality and cost-effectiveness of their care (based on measures to be set by the Secretary).

**[Page 310, Sec. 3008](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=310)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting in 2015, hospitals get less money when they treat patients for problems caused by their own negligence. This section also directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study in 2012 to see how this change will affect quality of care and costs.

**[Page 312, Sec. 3011](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=312)** - Alters another bill, the Public Health Service Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 312, Sec. 399HH](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=312)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to create a report in 2011 on a strategy to improve the delivery of health care services that will be presented to Congress. This strategy will be updated at least once a year, with annual updates submitted to Congress.

**[Page 314, Sec. 3012](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=314)** - Directs the President to put together an ""Interagency Working Group on Health Care Quality"", comprised of senior representatives from numerous agencies and departments (everything from the Department of Health and Human Services to the US Coast Guard), with the purpose of coordinating efforts between departments as they pertain to the strategy outlined in the last section. This group is to present a yearly report to Congress on their progress and recommendations.

**[Page 315, Sec. 3013](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=315)** - Alters another bill, the Public Health Service Act, to reorganize a part of that bill to make room for the following section, which is to be added.

**[Page 316, Sec. 931](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=316)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to consult with the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services at least three times a year to look for any gaps in their quality measures. The Secretary will award grants to expand these quality measures as needed. This section also alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to have the Administrator of the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services develop quality measures for those programs. From 2010-2014, $375 Million will be set aside for this section.

**[Page 319, Sec. 3014](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=319)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. The part of the Social Security Act it refers to creates a privately-owned non-profit group comprised of both health insurance representatives, as well as representatives of consumer advocacy groups, whose job it is to recommend ways to improve the quality and efficiency of health-care. What this section looks like it does is direct this group to recommend specific measures, and direct the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to keep track of how well these measures do.

**[Page 323, Sec. 3015](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=323)** - Alters another bill, the Public Health Service Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 323, Sec. 399II](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=323)** - The language is a bit confusing, but it looks like this section directs the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to create more efficient ways to collect data on the cost and effectiveness of health care, and directs the Secretary to give grants and contracts to organizations and individuals that will assist in this task.

**[Page 324, Sec. 399JJ](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=324)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to create a website to report to the public on how successful the measures taken to ensure quality of care have been. This report will be provider-specific, so it looks like this will actually be a way to compare how effective different health care providers are.

**[Page 325, Sec. 3021](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=325)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 325, Sec. 115A](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=325)** - Starting on January 1, 2011, this section creates something called the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMI), meant to test new ways to make Medicare services and payments easier and more efficient, while keeping or improving the quality of care for patients. They have a website, which you can see [here](http://innovations.cms.gov/). There are 20 methods to be tested that are outlined in the ACA, but the Secretary may direct the CMI to test others that look like they have a good chance of improving Medicare and Medicaid. $10,005,000,000 will be set aside for this program from 2010-2019. Starting in 2012, the Secretary of Health and Human Resources is to submit a yearly report to Congress on the CMI. A few other minor language changes are made to the Social Security Act as well, mostly to accommodate the addition of the CMI.

**[Page 332, Sec. 3022](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=332)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 332, Sec. 1899](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=332)** - By January 1, 2012, the Secretary of health and Human Services is to establish the Medicare Shared Savings Program. This program allows for the creation of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), organizations comprised of a group of health care providers (hospitals, doctors, etc.). These organizations may then receive payments for lowering costs while maintaining standards of care for Medicare patients. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is to determine what these standards are, and how they are to be measured and reported. Basically, if a hospital or other qualified group of caregivers can find ways to reduce Medicare costs without sacrificing quality of care, they'll be rewarded for doing so (and undoubtedly successful methods can then be extended to other areas of Medicare).

**[Page 337, Sec. 3023](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=337)** - By January 1, 2013, the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a ""pilot program"" to test to see if hospitals and doctors bundling payments (like how your cable and internet bill might be bundled) can help to lower costs without lowering the quality of care for patients. By January 1, 2015, the Secretary is to report to Congress on the progress of this program. By January 1, 2016, the Secretary is to report to Congress on the results of this program.

**[Page 343, Sec. 3024](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=343)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 343, Sec. 1866E](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=343)** - Starting January 1, 2012, the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create a ""demonstration program"" to test payment incentives for doctors, nurses, etc. that provide on-call 24/7 in-home care. Basically, it looks like the thinking is that maybe if people with chronic conditions can get check-ups at home, they'll be less likely to need to go back to the hospital repeatedly for the same problem, less likely to make a trip to the emergency room, and more likely to get better-quality care. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is to develop standards for the care given to patients, and doctors who can reduce the costs of care for their patients while still meeting these standards will get incentive payments. $30,000,000 is set aside for this program from 2010-2015, and the Secretary is to report to Congress on its progress.

The next few sections focus on reducing readmissions, where a patient keeps coming back for the same problem. Apparently, this is a big drain on Medicare. ""One in five patients discharged from a hospital - approximately 2.6 million seniors - is readmitted within 30 days, at a cost of over $26 billion every year"" ( [Source: The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation](http://www.innovations.cms.gov/initiatives/Partnership-for-Patients/CCTP/index.html?itemID=CMS1239313) ).

**[Page 347, Sec. 3025](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=347)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting in 2012, the payments made under Medicare to hospitals will be slightly reduced in cases of excessive readmission. This is apparently to encourage hospitals to fix the problem a patient comes in with in the first place. This section also adds the following section to another bill, the Public Health Service Act.

**[Page 352, Sec. 399KK](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=352)** - Within two years of the enactment of this section (So... March, 2012, I think), the Secretary of Health and Human Services will make a program for hospitals with a high amount of readmissions to improve their readmission rates. So, while the previous section penalizes them for having too many readmissions, this one helps them to get their readmissions to acceptable levels. Hospitals that do this will report to the Secretary on the changes they make and how effective they are.

**[Page 352, Sec. 3026](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=352)** - From January 1, 2011, to January 1, 2016, the Secretary of Health and Human Resources will create a program to try and improve the care for patients being transitioned from one location (like a hospital) to another (such as the at-home care or Community-Based Organizations, for the purpose of reducing readmissions.

**[Page 354, Sec. 3027](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=354)** - Alters another bill, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, to extend a demonstration project in that bill to last roughly another year, and setting aside an additional $1,600,000 for this. This demonstration project had to do with gainsharing. From what I can tell, it looks like the idea is to give doctors and hospital staff incentive to reduce costs (without reducing the quality of care) by giving them a portion of that savings.

**[Page 355, Sec. 3101](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=355)** - This section was repealed. I'm not sure what it was before, but it's nothing more than a placeholder now.

**[Page 355, Sec. 3102](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=355)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to renew one part that sets a bottom limit for the Work Geographic Index (used for determining Medicare costs), as well as adding what looks like some additional criteria for determining those costs.

**[Page 357, Sec. 3103](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=357)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to renew one part that allows people to be exempted from some of the costs due to physical therapy expenses.

**[Page 357, Sec. 3104](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=357)** - Alters another bill, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits
Improvement and Protection Act of 2000. It's really hard to read through this, but as best I can tell, this just extends Medicare payments for laboratory services for an additional year (2010).

**[Page 357, Sec. 3105](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=357)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. This one's also a bit difficult to read, but from what I can tell, it's just renewing funding for ambulance services for Medicare patients through 2011.

**[Page 357, Sec. 3106](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=357)** - Alters another bill, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007. Another one that's difficult to read, but from what I can tell, it's just renewing funding for long-term care hospitals for Medicare patients for another two years.

**[Page 357, Sec. 3107](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=357)** - Alters another bill, the Medicare Improvements for Patients
and Providers Act of 2008, extending funding for mental health treatments for Medicare patients an additional year (until 2010).

**[Page 358, Sec. 3108](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=358)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting on January 1, 2011, Physician Assistants are added to the list of professionals (line nurses and doctors) allowed to order ""post-hospital extended care services"", services that a patient can be given after a 3+ day stay at a hospital. In other words, it's just giving physician assistants more freedom to sign you up for services you need after a long hospital stay.

**[Page 358, Sec. 3109](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=358)** -
Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. It looks like this is just clarifying when pharmacies have to send accreditation information regarding their quality standards to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as well as indicating exemptions for certain types of pharmacies.

**[Page 359, Sec. 3110](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=359)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. It looks like the gist of it is that some beneficiaries of Tricare (civilian health benefits for veterans) will have an additional year to enroll in Medicare Part B, if they choose to do so.

**[Page 360, Sec. 3111](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=360)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to reduce the amount paid to hospitals for X-Ray bone density scans in 2010 and 2011, as well as directing the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to work with the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies to conduct a report on the effect that this has.

**[Page 361, Sec. 3112](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=361)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to cut all the funds going to the Medicare Improvement Fund in 2014. Specifically, this is cutting $22,290,000,000. Most likely this cut is because the PPACA does many of the same things the Medicare Improvement Fund is intended to, so this payment would be redundant.

**[Page 361, Sec. 3113](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=361)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a two-year demonstration project, starting July 1, 2011, where complex lab tests are paid using separate payments. No later than two years after the demonstration project is completed (so by July 1, 2015), the Secretary is to report to Congress on how this affected expenses and quality of care. $5,000,000 is set aside for this section from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Program Management Account, and the actual payments themselves are to get funds from the Federal Supplemental Medical Insurance Trust Fund.

I subscribed about 20 minutes ago and it said 1,000 readers - now it's at around ~~2,500~~ ~~4,000~~ nearly 20,000 readers. Checking the new queue, I'm seeing a disappointing number of submissions that are getting completely lost/ignored and also a bunch of submissions that are stupid attempts at the poster being funny.

I'm just going to say three things:

* **CHECK THE NEW QUEUE.**
* **USE YOUR VOTES.**
* **KEEP YOUR SUBMISSIONS SERIOUS.**

I know the last one sounds like I'm being a dick/boring/too serious but I see a lot of potential in this subreddit and I'd rather miss out on a few short-lived laughs from (p/f)unny titles to avoid compromising this subreddit.

Thanks that is all.

**Edit:** Two things? Three, I meant.

**Edit 2:** As an addition, two more points:

* **USE THE SEARCH FUNCTION.** So far, there's been 3 posts on stocks, 2 on the internet, 2 on ISPs (I posted the first 2 hours ago and got 4 upvotes, the second one is from 30 minutes ago and has 14 upvotes *sigh*), 2 on money laundering and I'm sure plenty more. It takes like 5 seconds to enter a keyword and search.
* ** DON'T POST QUESTIONS THAT HAVE SINGLE, DEFINITIVE ANSWERS.** Please take it to [/r/answers](http://reddit.com/r/answers). No submissions like, ""Can someone explain to me the density of hydrogen?"" when you actually are asking, ""What is the density of hydrogen?"" for example.

We have a few requests for you all as the moderators of such an awesome subreddit. In no particular order:

* **Spread the word!** As this community grows further, the breadth of knowledge and intrigue will only increase.

* **Read the sidebar!** Maybe if it's been awhile, you can just glance over it. Or make sure your controversial comment or post fits our rather lax guidelines and rules.

* **Ask ""why"" questions!** This isn't a strict rule at all, but it makes for better discussion. Also, be specific instead of just saying ""ELI5: some huge topic.""

* **Use the themes!** They're fun.

* **Mark your posts as answered!** Please! And you can still comment on a post that is answered and add to the discussion-- it's more for the sake of the subreddit archive (and people who casually just want to see answered questions).

* **Filter the subreddit by answered/unanswered!** You'll find that down lower in the sidebar and it will surely enhance your ELI5 experience.

* **Subscribe if you lurk!** Why not?

I have to give a huge shoutout to /u/lucas747 for configuring /r/ExplainLikeImFiveBot. It does a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff and lucas747 has been really patient and helpful in programming it! Hasn‚Äôt addressed the problem that it‚Äôs semi-sentient yet though.

The beauty of this subreddit in my opinion is twofold. First, that explanations can vary from spot-on analogies to layman-friendly summaries of scientific, political, cultural, or other information. And also the fact that this subreddit isn't about OP! That's the best part. There are 300,000 people who will see your explanation, and who will have a question answered that they've never even thought to ask. That's why I personally love this subreddit. I see a question that seems so obvious, and yet upon closer inspection it is very curious. And then five people explain it in terms I can understand, each with their own spin on it. Then there's healthy (or heated!) discussion, and all of a sudden we have four comments in the top ten on /r/bestof.

Looking forward to many more explainers. Tell your friends!

Sidebar

---

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;[Colorful boxes]

These are themes! Click one and enjoy. PLEASE don't spam us with theme requests right away. Don't say ""PURPLE."" As a matter of fact, unless you can do the CSS yourself based on the thing we have going in the stylesheet, it will probably be a waste of time to request one at all.

&gt;ELI5 is an inclusive place to ask questions and get simple, layman-friendly answers, without fear of judgement. Please do not criticize a post or response because it is not something a literal five-year-old would know or ask.

A few key words here.

1. INCLUSIVE

We are supportive and respectful here. The mods aren't lazy, but we have a policy of giving most posters and commenters the benefit of the doubt with their questions and answers. There aren't many great reasons to remove a great question.

2. GET

It's not just about OP. We have the ""answered"" tag (which we'll get to later on) for people who *aren't* OP to find answers if they don't know. The great thing about ELI5 is that you'll find fascinating^5 explanations to things you'd never even thought to wonder about. It's awesome!

3. LAYMAN-FRIENDLY

This is the big one. ***ELI5 is not about explaining things on a literal five year old level!*** ^6 Please Please PLEASE don't be obnoxious and think you're funny by saying ""I'm five and I didn't get that!"" On the other side of the coin, **don't dumb your explanation down** to be comprehendible by a five year old. Use layman-friendly vocabulary (or define technical terms), and use analogies if they fit, but don't try to force anything. Just explain it to someone who wouldn't be familiar with it. For a role-playing Q&amp;A subreddit, try /r/explainlikeiama.

&amp;nbsp;
***


&gt;**General Guidelines**

Guidelines, not rules. Even the third one isn't a *rigid* rule, but you get the idea.

&gt;Be polite and respectful-- rude, offensive, and judgmental posts will be removed at the discretion of the mods.

&gt;Avoid bias. Discussion of politics and other controversial topics is allowed and often necessary, but try to remain textbook-level fair to all sides, for both questions and answers. Acknowledging your own bias is often a great way to advance the conversation.

Just be candid in your responses. Flaming is no good either. Not only is controversy ""allowed and often necessary,"" it's encouraged! Just keep it respectful.

&gt;Trolls and unapproved bots will be banned.

If it's spammy. Just run it by the mods.

&gt;Remember the top answer may not always be the best one. It could even be incorrect-- be sure to read multiple responses!

If a top-level answer is fundamentally incorrect (and proven so-- the mods are not experts), and *especially* if the next visible comment does not refute it, we may remove it at our discretion.

&amp;nbsp;

***

&gt; **Submission Guidelines**

&gt; The best questions ask why or how something happens or came to pass.

Absolutely. ""Why"" questions are awesome. Note that even a simple question that does not ask ""why"" can provoke great discussion and explanations, so this is certainly not a rule.

Just as importantly, avoid saying ELI5: Bitcoins. Not only has that been asked a million times^7 , but it also isn't very helpful. At least if you're going to title your post that way include a more specific query in the body of the post.

&gt;Do not ask yes-or-no questions or ask for a walkthrough/procedure-- try /r/answers or /r/techsupport. This is for conceptual explanations.

This is big. These posts will be removed. Also, askreddit type questions will be removed. We want **relatively objective questions only.** Ones up for interpretation and debate, but still relatively objective with less opinion-- in other words, not questions that purely poll the subreddit.

&gt;[Walter](http://i.imgur.com/mGwRQ.jpg) rule: Do not post a loaded question and ask ‚Äúam I wrong?‚Äù Keep an open mind!

""Am I wrong? Am I wrong?"" ""You're not wrong, you're just an asshole."" This was a famous exchange in The Big Lebowski, in which Walter uses his line one too many times (probably talking about Vietnam). Try /r/changemyview if you're looking to be proven wrong, or just rephrase your question to be more conducive to positive discussion.

&gt;Be specific! Don't ask about a general topic if you can help it. The more detailed the better.

Like I said about the bitcoin question above. Be specific!

&gt;**Search** before submitting! If it's been asked before, indicate that the previous answers didn't help. Otherwise your question may be removed.

THIS 1,000,000 tiems irl. Please search. ELI5 is also an archive. If you need a more up-to-date explanation, try adjusting the search by date and then ask again if you can't find anything.

&gt;Remember the spirit of this subreddit. This is for getting simple answers to complex questions, not a repository of any questions.

#

&gt;Please mark your question as answered if you are satisfied with the responses! 

Yeah, please do that. Don't make /u/ExplainLikeImFiveBot come after you!^8,9

&gt;**Commenting Guidelines**

&gt;Do not use undefined jargon. Jargon is great, but provide a simple definition first.

&gt;Beware analogies--Analogies are great if they're not stretched. Use them strategically.

These are both really important, I've just already covered them.^10

&gt;Sources and links to further reading are encouraged, but please summarize them.

I think people will do this naturally. Don't just link to something without explaining why!

&gt;Try not to speculate, and if you do so logically, please note that you are not 100% sure in your answer.

No one will judge you for not knowing something. If they do, welcome to the internet.

&gt;ELI5 is not for literal five year olds. It is for average redditors. Preschooler-friendly stories tend to be more confusing and patronizing.

So that about covers everything. I'm approaching the character limit for the body of the self post, and this is by far the longest thing I've ever typed on reddit.

Thank you for reading this far, if you've read it all without skipping you deserve some sort of medal. You could've used the time you spent reading this to make one. But no, you read this thing instead. Don't feel bad though, I'm the one that typed it all out.

And thanks for visiting ELI5! If you haven't subscribed already, please go for it! If you're reading this and you're new to reddit, you're probably subscribed BY DEFAULT because we're a DEFAULT subreddit now.

Happy redditing!

For the other mods,

^7 If I had a bitcoin for every time this was asked, I'd probably lose money over time.

^8 Don't feel pressured if it asks you to mark it as answered and you don't want to. However, just because you want more answers doesn't mean you shouldn't mark it as answered. It's just so that people who want a quick answer can know if it's there, both now and down the road in searches. The post is still very much open to more discussion.

^9 The bot is likely semi-sentient at this point. It's a problem.

^10 I think. Or maybe I'm senile. Just ask another mod if there's some confusion; I'd prefer to remain ignorant instead of getting the Shutter Island treatment.

The reason I was asking is because of a mishap I had back when I was 17.

So soon after, started getting short of breath, got panic wave, that pulsating stabbing feeling. 

So as my friends notice me freaking out, they decide to tell me that what I smoked wasn't weed. It was k2 (panic). You know, that stuff that gives people heart attacks. So after 13 hours it finally subsided, had that post traumatic look on life.

RookieMonster	1390	486	648	"There's a lot I don't understand here, not least how they identify each other in everyday situations. But what about getting a passport, visiting a prison, getting a library card, getting a driver's license (not relevant in ~~Iran~~ Saudia Arabia (thanks to buried_treasure) I know), passing through airport security or getting a bank card? The list goes on. 

If you're wearing a [burqa](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01428/Burqa_1428680c.jpg), a [niqƒÅb](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Woman_in_burqa%2C_Aleppo.jpg/496px-Woman_in_burqa%2C_Aleppo.jpg), or most of all a [boshiya](http://mythousandtrinkets.weebly.com/uploads/7/1/2/6/7126647/7899797.jpg?279) then you won't be able to be identified at all. 

I suppose someone will say that they just take them off but the Qur'an is really clear about who they can reveal their 'modesty' to. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_clothing

I should clarify. I'm not just interested in how they're IDed in Islamic Countries but also how they're identified on entry to non islamic countries or when going about their business there. Could a women entering the United Kingdom with a face veil be asked to raise it?

Another edit: this is the passage that makes me wonder about female inspectors;

&gt;[Women] should [...] not display their beauty except to their husbands, their fathers, their husband's fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, **or their women**, or the slaves whom their right hands possess, or male servants free of physical needs, or small children...

As I said before, this is a huge undertaking. The [current version of the bill](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf) is 974 pages long, and I'm going through it bit by bit. But it's going to take a while to do it. I'll keep adding to this until I'm finished, but given that I have a job and a social life, I can't say how long it'll take.

Also, I'll try to address questions people have as best I can, but again, it might take me a while to get back to you. Please be patient.

(**Note: For the sake of clarity and continuity, any references to page numbers will be referring to the PDF file, not the page number in the document**)

**[Page 362, Sec. 3114](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=362)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting on January 1, 2011, nurse-midwife services received through a fee schedule can receive up to as much as if those same services were administered by a doctor. The apparent purpose is to make nurse-midwife services more accessible.

**[Page 363, Sec. 3121](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=363)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to renew Medicare coverage for outpatient services in rural hospitals for another year (through January 1, 2011).

**[Page 363, Sec. 3122](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=363)** - Alters another bill, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, to extend from July 1, 2010 to July 1, 2011, payments to rural hospitals for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests covered under Medicare Part B.

**[Page 363, Sec. 3123](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=363)** - Alters another bill, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, to extend for an additional 5 years (ending sometime in 2014) a demonstration project to establish rural community hospitals. In addition, the number of these hospitals is doubled from 15 to 30, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services is to expand the states in which these hospitals can be located. This section also makes a series of minor language changes to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 to make the language fit better.

**[Page 364, Sec. 3124](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=364)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to extend the Medicare Dependent Hospital (MDH) program for rural hospitals for another year (through October 1, 2012).

**[Page 365, Sec. 3125](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=365)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, For the fiscal years 2011 and 2012, the amount paid to low-volume hospitals is increased by up to 25%, based on how many patients they've discharged. In addition, for those years, what qualifies as a ""low-volume hospital"" is expanded to include hospitals that are over 15 miles away from another qualifying hospital (instead of 25 miles away).

**[Page 365, Sec. 3126](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=365)** - Alters another bill, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, to expand a demonstration project revolving around community-level integrated health services on a county-by-county level. This section also removes the restriction on the number of counties that can be included in this demonstration project, and replaces some terminology.

**[Page 366, Sec. 3127](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=366)** - Directs the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission to conduct a study on how adequate payments to rural hospitals are. This report is to be given to Congress by January 1, 2011.

**[Page 366, Sec. 3128](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=366)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to increase payments for emergency hospital services and ambulances from 100% of what is deemed a ""reasonable cost"" to 101%.

**[Page 366, Sec. 3129](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=366)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting on January 1, 2010, grant money in that bill given to rural hospitals stays available until it is used (rather than expiring). It also adds that this grant money can now be used to make sure these hospitals are up to the standards set in the PPACA.

**[Page 367, Sec. 3131](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=367)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting in 2014, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will start to phase in changes to the amounts paid to caregivers for home health services, based on a number of factors, including the type and cost of services, whether the caregiver is rural or urban, whether the caregiver is for-profit or non-profit, etc. The phase-in is to be across 4 years, to make sure the shift in payments isn't too much of a shock to the market. In addition, this section directs the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission to conduct a study on the effect this has on access to and quality of care. This report is to be given to Congress by January 1, 2015. On top of that, this section makes a number of smaller edits to indicate that the Secretary is to limit the amounts paid to these caregivers in a number of different ways. This section *also* alters another bill, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, to increase the payments made to rural home health services by 3% from April 1, 2010 to January 1, 2016. The Secretary is to conduct a study on home health agency costs for Medicare beneficiaries. The Secretary is to present this report to Congress no later than March 1, 2014. Also, after seeing the results of this study, the Secretary may conduct a demonstration project to test the changes recommended to improve services. If the Secretary decides to go ahead with this demonstration project, it is to last for four years, and start no later than January 1, 2015. The secretary is to set aside $500,000,000 from the the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund to fund both the study and the demonstration project. And if the Secretary does choose to go ahead with this demonstration, he is to evaluate and report on it to Congress.

**[Page 371, Sec. 3132](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=371)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to gather data on payments for hospice care starting no later than January 1, 2011. At some point after October 1, 2013, the Secretary is to revise payments for hospice care. This section also says that a hospice care provider can only continue services if every 180 days they have a face-to-face meeting with the patient to determine whether that patient still needs hospice care.

**[Page 373, Sec. 3133](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=373)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting in 2014, the method for determining disproportionate share hospital payments (payments to hospitals who treat indigent patients). will change, to be determined by a number of factors outlined here. It's a bit complicated, but the short version is that it looks like it'll be cutting these payments by about 75%, give or take. This is probably because it is expected that these hospitals will have far fewer uninsured patients to treat.

**[Page 375, Sec. 3134](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=375)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to identify which services are ""misvalued"" (that are more expensive than they need to be or can be made more efficient through bundling). The Secretary is to make adjustments to the amount we pay hospitals for these services. This section also repeals a part of another bill, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, that seems to direct the Secretary to just accept the generally accepted costs for these services. It also repeals a part of the Social Security Act that I'm having difficulty finding, but looks like it was something similar.

**[Page 377, Sec. 3135](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=377)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. I had to do some looking around online to get a feel for just what this does, but from what I see [here](http://primaryimmune.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/X08-ImagingPaymentUPDATED092911.pdf), it looks like starting in 2011, it's increasing from 50% to 75% a rate used in determining expenses related to costly diagnostic imaging equipment. and reduces the payments for the use of this equipment by 25%. This section also directs the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to report on whether this change in payments will reduce costs by $3,000,000,000. That report is to be made available no later than January 1, 2013. That strikes me as an oddly specific number, so I suspect that they expect that this *will* save that much.

**[Page 378, Sec. 3136](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=378)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to change the Medicare payment for powered wheelchairs. Beginning on January 1, 2011, for the first three months of paying for a powered wheelchair, it goes up from 10% of the cost to 15% of the cost, and for subsequent months it goes down from 7.5% of the cost to 6% of the cost.

**[Page 379, Sec. 3137](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=379)** - This one had me stuck longer than any other section so far. I had to look around for what others said about it to get a better idea. Some thanks go to [this](http://books.google.com/books?id=tCTt0sq2vaEC&amp;pg=PA495&amp;lpg=PA495&amp;dq=SEC.+3137.+%22wage+index%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Xnn_lvnUTr&amp;sig=M4WiUHgS4gyHPe78yFwJ7ObrkWg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=P1JeUKDKFeK6igLskIDgBg&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=SEC.%203137.%20%22wage%20index%22&amp;f=false) Google Books archived book. Anyway, this section alters another bill, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, directing the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to report to Congress no later than December 31, 2011 on reforming the hospital wage index, which determines how Medicare will compensate various medical professionals. Anyway, the Secretary's report is to take numerous factors into consideration,and apparently is meant to contain costs.

**[Page 381, Sec. 3138](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=381)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the costs associated with cancer hospitals compared to other hospitals. The secretary will determine an adjustment (presumably to payments) to account for the difference in costs.

**[Page 381, Sec. 3139](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=381)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, referring to payments for biosimilar biologics. Biologics are medical treatments made from living organisms (like vaccines), and ""biosimilar"" refers to products that are effectively the same as existing products. This section says that Medicare will pay 106% of the cost of existing products for these biosimilar ones. It looks like the idea is to give upstart drug companies a chance to break into the market so they can compete with major drug companies that already exist.

**[Page 382, Sec. 3140](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=382)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a Medicare Hospice Concurrent Care demonstration program, which will last for 3 years. As I understand it, hospice care is care for patients who are dying that doesn't attempt to treat the ailment that the patient is dying from, it only tries to ease their pain. Generally, Medicare recipients have to choose one or the other. The demonstration program this section creates will allow for some patients to choose both. This demonstration program is intended to be cost-neutral, and the Secretary is to report to Congress on how this affected quality of care and cost-effectiveness.

**[Page 383, Sec. 3141](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=383)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services in how to go about calculating the Hospital Wage Index Floor apparently, to ensure that no hospital has a wage index beneath what is legally required, while still making the changes in wage indexes budget neutral.

**[Page 383, Sec. 3142](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=383)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on costs and payments in urban Medicare-dependent hospitals. Within 9 months of the enactment of the PPACA, the secretary will submit this report to Congress.

**[Page 384, Sec. 3143](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=384)** - Says that nothing in the PPACA will reduce home health benefits guaranteed in the Social Security Act.

The next series of sections is all about Medicare Advantage. For those unaware, Medicare Advantage (also known as Medicare+Choice and Medicare Part C) is an optional Medicare program for those who want to get their insurance through a private provider. However, since it was created, Medicare Advantage costs have ballooned to be over 12% more than costs for comparable services under traditional Medicare ( [source](http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/85xx/doc8568/sprattltr8-17-07.pdf) ). The following sections, in a few different ways, seek to bring Medicare Advantage costs back in line with normal Medicare costs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that from 2012 to 2021, this will save $507 billion ( [source](http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12119/03-30-healthcarelegislation.pdf) ).

**[Page 384, Sec. 3201](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=384)** - Firstly, this section has been repealed and replaced after the PPACA was passed by another bill, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA). However, the new text has been entered here. It amends another bill, the Social Security Act. It's got a lot of talk about numbers, but the gist of it seems to be that it's going to be lowering the amount paid for Medicare Advantage until the costs are more in line with the costs of normal Medicare. This section seeks to bring those costs back down to something comparable to normal Medicare costs.

**[Page 389, Sec. 3202](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=389)** -  Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to specify that starting on January 1, 2011, some specific services under Medicare Advantage cannot cost more than those under Medicare Part A and B. This is essentially just additional details on the cost-saving stuff in section 3201. Also a lot of numbers talk regarding Medicare Advantage rebates.

**[Page 391, Sec. 3203](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=391)** -  Another section repealed and replaced by HCERA. The current section alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to make it so that adjustment of costs for Medicare Advantage services continues on a yearly basis (previously it only continued until 2010).

**[Page 392, Sec. 3204](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=392)** -  Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting in 2011, for the first 45 days of the year, people enrolled in Medicare Advantage can choose to change their plan to a standard Medicare plan.

**[Page 392, Sec. 3205](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=392)** -  Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to extend the Medicare Advantage Special Needs Program through 2014, as well as listing a lot of requirements that these plans would need to meet.

**[Page 395, Sec. 3206](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=395)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to renew until January 1, 2013 the ability for Medicare recipients to obtain Reasonable Cost Contracts.

**[Page 395, Sec. 3207](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=395)** - Making some sort of comment noting that the Secretary of Health and Human Services is to extend service area waivers for Medicare Advantage plans for providers who contracted with the Secretary for those waivers prior to October 1, 2009.

**[Page 395, Sec. 3208](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=395)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to make permanent senior housing facilities created under a specific demonstration project as of December 31, 2009.

**[Page 396, Sec. 3209](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=396)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to clarify that the Secretary of Health and Human Services has the right to reject bids for plans by a Medicare Advantage organization, and bids for plans by a Prescription Drug Plan sponsor, if those plans propose significant increases to costs or reductions to service.

**[Page 396, Sec. 3210](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=396)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to request the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to revise standards for supplemental Medicare benefit plans.

The next group of sections deals with Medicare Part D, the Medicare Drug Prescription Program

**[Page 397, Sec. 3301](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=397)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. Firstly, it says that starting January 1, 2011, any drug companies wanting to continue to work with Medicare Part D must participate in the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program outlined in this section. Secondly, it outlines the actual Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program, which also starts January 1, 2011. This section addresses the infamous ""Donut Hole"" in coverage, which plagued Medicare recipients who purchased enough drugs to surpass the prescription drug coverage limit, but not enough to qualify for catastrophic coverage. It does so by making the drug companies that work with Medicare give discounts to those who fall within that gap.

**[Page 405, Sec. 3302](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=405)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that the low-income benefit for Medicare part is calculated without taking into consideration discounts and rebates received under Medicare Advantage. This way, those getting discounts like that won't be penalized for it when purchasing drugs.

**[Page 405, Sec. 3303](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=405)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. From what I can tell, starting January 1, 2011, it makes it so the Secretary of Health and Human Services can allow a prescription drug plan to charge low-income beneficiaries the low-income subsidy if the plan's premium is more expensive than the low-income subsidy plus a ""de minimis"" amount. That amount is apparently $2 ( [source](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Prescription-Drug-Coverage/PrescriptionDrugCovContra/Downloads/MemoDeMinimisClarification_102706.pdf) ).

**[Page 406, Sec. 3304](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=406)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. This section deals with widows and widowers on low-income assistance. Normally, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services check beneficiaries' financial status on a regular basis to make sure they still qualify for low-income programs, and if someone is making too much money in a given timeframe, they may no longer qualify as ""low income"". However, generally when someone's wife or husband dies, they inherit their significant others' stuff. This section says that that check on beneficiaries' status can not happen within a year of the death of a spouse, so someone isn't dropped from Medicare or Medicaid just because they lost a loved one. This section goes into effect January 1, 2011.

**[Page 406, Sec. 3305](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=406)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that no later than January 1, 2011, when the Secretary of Health and Human Resources reassigns someone to a different Medicare drug plan (apparently due to a change in their economic status), they are to be informed of the differences between their old plan and the new one, as well as being informed of their right to request a coverage determination, exception, or reconsideration.

**[Page 407, Sec. 3306](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=407)** - Alters another bill, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, by designating an additional $15,000,000 be set aside to fund the State Health Insurance Program from 2010 through 2012, an additional $15,000,000 be set aside to fund Aging and Disability Resource Centers from 2010 through 2012, an additional $5,000,000 be set aside to fund a contract with the National Center for Benefits and Outreach Enrollment from 2010 through 2012. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can request support from the entities funded by this section for wellness and disease prevention outreach programs.

**[Page 408, Sec. 3307](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=408)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. As I understand it, starting in 2011, Medicate Advantage insurance companies must include coverage for specific categories of drugs designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Until the secretary designates which drugs are to be covered, these categories are to include anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antineoplastics, antipsychotics, antiretrovirals, and immunosuppressants for the treatment of transplant rejection.

**[Page 409, Sec. 3308](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=409)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. From what I can tell, starting on January 1, 2011, if you make over $80,000 ($160,000 for couples filing taxes jointly), your Medicare Part D monthly costs will increase in a fashion similar to Medicare Part B. This amount will be taken out of your social security.

**[Page 412, Sec. 3309](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=412)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act so that on a date no earlier than January 1, 2012, if you're eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, and receiving home or community-based services instead of going to a hospital, you can't also qualify for cost-sharing under Medicare Part D. From what I can tell, this is because they can most likely get cost-sharing by other means.

**[Page 412, Sec. 3310](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=412)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting on January 1, 2012, drug plans for patients in long-term care facilities must be more efficiently managed and drugs given to patients must be dispensed in a more efficient manner, using uniform dispensing techniques, to reduce waste.

**[Page 413, Sec. 3311](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=413)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create and maintain a complaint system, to be made available on Medicare.gov, and the Secretary shall report yearly to Congress on this system. It looks like [this](http://medicare.gov/claims-and-appeals/file-a-complaint/complaints.html) is the page for complaints.

**[Page 413, Sec. 3312](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=413)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to make a standard and uniform appeals process for those who feel their claim should not have been denied. This is to happen by January 1, 2012.

**[Page 414, Sec. 3313](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=414)** - Directs the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a study about the type of drugs used by those in Medicare Advantage plans, which the Secretary of Health and Human Resources is to present to Congress no later than July 1 every year starting in 2011. The Inspector General is also to conduct a study on the 200 most frequently-used Medicare Part D drugs and their pricing under both normal Medicare and Medicare Advantage. That report is to be given to Congress no later than October 1, 2011.

**[Page 415, Sec. 3314](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=415)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. This one is hard to parse, but from what I can tell, it makes it so that starting on January 1, 2011, drugs paid by AIDS drug programs and Indian Health Services count towards calculations for determining qualification for Medicare Part D catastrophic care. I imagine that this is because someone with AIDS definitely needs catastrophic care. Not sure what Indian Health Services has to do with anything, though.

**[Page 416, Sec. 3315](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=416)** - This section was repealed by another bill, HCERA. However, it replaces it with similar text, which is mirrored here. It alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to give a $250 rebate to Medicare recipients who fall into that ""donut hole"" that I mentioned above in Section 3301. It's only in effect for 2010.

**[Page 417, Sec. 3401](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=417)** - This section alters another bill, the Social Security Act. It reduces the increases in payments that many various types of medical facilities and services were going to be getting through Medicare, undoubtedly to keep down Medicare's ballooning costs. For some of these services, it reduces those increases gradually, starting at a quarter of a percent less than what those payment increases were going to be, gradually going up to three-quarters of a percent less than what the payment increases were going to be. For some, it reduces increases in payments based on a productivity assessment (which, from what I can tell, is based primarily on what operating costs are). For some, it reduces the increases in payments by a flat amount. And for some, it reduces the increases in payment using some combination of those three methods. It bears note that this is undoubtedly what some alarmists believe is a reduction in Medicare services, but none of these reduce Medicare payments below what they are now, they only slow down the speed at which Medicare costs are *rising*, and it seems like it's largely trying to keep payments close to the actual costs needed by these facilities and services.

**[Page 426, Sec. 3402](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=426)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to say that from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2019, ""income thresholds"" (if you earn more than that amount a year, you're considered high-income) for Medicare Part B will be frozen at their 2010 levels, rather than being tied to inflation like they previously had been. Looking around, apparently those thresholds are currently at $85,000 if you're single and $170,000 if you're filing taxes jointly. Freezing the thresholds means they'll stay at those dollar amounts instead of rising with inflation.

**[Page 426, Sec. 3403](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=426)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to create the Independent Medicare Advisory Board. This is one of the sections that brought up talk of ""death panels!"", but the truth is it's pretty benign. The board is to be comprised of 15 experts (who cannot hold any other employment while they are part of the board, so there's no conflict of interest) who are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, as well as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Administrator of the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, and the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, who will be nonvoting members. The presidential appointees serve 6-year nonconsecutive terms. The board's purpose is to reduce Medicare spending per person by submitting proposals to be enacted by the Secretary unless Congress says otherwise. These proposals *must* cut costs, *must not* ration health care, and *must not* increase costs to Medicare recipients, *must not* cut Medicare benefits, and *must not* modify eligibility criteria. In addition, until 2019, these proposals *must not* reduce payments for hospitals and services (probably because the ACA already does some of that). It can cut payments for administrative expenses. The board is also to try and make its proposals increase Medicare solvency, improve quality of care, improve access to services, and reduce spending in areas with excess growth in costs, while also taking into consideration the needs of care providers. Before these proposals go to the Secretary, they are to be reviewed by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. Then the Secretary reviews them, and then they are brought to Congress. Starting in 2014, these proposals are to be brought to both houses of Congress and the President by January 15 each year. The President will review this proposal for two days before bringing his own proposal to Congress. A few different committees in Congress are to review this proposal and report back to Congress on it by April 1. Congress is not allowed to make another bill to repeal or alter congressional consideration, although the Senate may waive Congressional consideration by use of a three-fifths vote that's subject to appeal. This section goes into all sorts of Congressional rules for how the proposal is to be considered before deciding whether to pass it. Anyway, Congress votes on whether to pass it, and the President may choose to veto it if it is passed (like any other bill). If the proposal passes, it is to be implemented by August 15. Additionally, in 2017, Congress can vote on whether to discontinue the board. If the board didn't create a proposal in a given year, it is still to report to Congress on matters relating to Medicare, and every year regardless it is to create a public report as well. They are also to do a yearly advisory report on recommendations for ways to improve health care outside of Medicare.

**[Page 448, Sec. 3501](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=448)** - Alters another bill, the Public Health Service Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 448, Sec. 933](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=448)** - Okay, I've had a damn difficult time trying to find the actual text of the Public Health Service Act. Everything I come up with doesn't seem to fit the text that this bill is inserting into it. This section directs the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to research, create, and to put into practice quality improvement practices and create training for those practices, and to and to this end it directs the Director to establish The Center for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety of AHRQ. This section sets aside $20,000,000 for 2010 though 2014 to be put towards carrying out this section.

**[Page 452, Sec. 934](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=452)** - Directs the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to give out grants to health providers that need financial help meeting the quality improvement measures mentioned in section 933. Recipients of these grants need to match every $5 of funds they receive with $1 of their own.

**[Page 454, Sec. 3502](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=454)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and human Services to establish a program to provide grants for community-based ""health teams"" to support primary care providers. It looks like this is creating a community-based support system of professionals so primary care doctors have specialists to refer patients to. These ""health teams"" need to have a plan to be self-sustaining within three years.

**[Page 457, Sec. 3503](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=457)** - Alters another bill, the Public Health Service Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 457, Sec. 935](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=457)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to establish a program no later than May 1, 2010, to provide grants to implement medication management services for the treatment of chronic diseases.

**[Page 459, Sec. 3504](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=459)** - Alters another bill, the Public Health Service Act, to change the wording of a few parts and add the following section.

**[Page 459, Sec. 1204](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=459)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to award at least 4 multi-year contracts to states that support pilot projects to test innovative new ways to do regional emergency care. States have to match every $3 of funds they receive with $1 of their own. Within 90 days of completing a pilot project, states are to report to the Secretary about it. This section also adds the following section.

**[Page 462, Sec. 498D](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=462)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to support research of various government agencies in emergency medical care systems and emergency medicine.

**[Page 463, Sec. 3505](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=463)** - Alters another bill, the Public Health Service Act, to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish 3 programs to award grants to Indian health facilities. The Secretary may also award grants to certain low-income trauma centers. It goes into detail as to what sort of trauma centers can get the grants and what sort of grants they can get. It also further alters the Public Health Service Act by adding the following section.

**[Page 466, Sec. 1245](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=466)** - Sets aside $100,000,000 to pay for the previous section in 2009, and ""such sums as may be necessary"" from 2010 through 2015. It also further alters the Public Health Service Act by adding the following section.

**[Page 467, Sec. 1246](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=467)** - Clarifies what ""uncompensated care costs"" means. It also further alters the Public Health Service Act by adding the following section.

**[Page 467, Sec. 1281](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=467)** - Allows states to award grants to create or strengthen trauma centers.

**[Page 469, Sec. 1282](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=469)** - Sets aside $600,000,000 to pay for the previous section in 2010 though 2015.

**[Page 469, Sec. 3506](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=469)** - Alters another bill, the Public Health Service Act, to add the following section.

**[Page 469, Sec. 936](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=469)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create a program to provide grants for the development of ""Patient Decision Aids"", materials to help patients and doctors to better know what their options are when there is a choice regarding different forms of treatment. These materials are to be made freely available.

**[Page 472, Sec. 3507](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=472)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study to determine whether health care decision-making would be improved by standardizing the way drug information is presented on prescription drugs. This study is to be done by 2011, and if it is determined that it would be improved, within 3 years the Secretary is to create regulation to enact that standardization.

**[Page 472, Sec. 3508](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=472)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants for demonstration projects to medical schools that incorporate quality improvement and patient safety into their curriculum. Schools can submit proposals and, the Secretary decides if it's worth trying, and the school tracks data on the new curriculum's results. For every $5 of grant money a school gets for this, the school must contribute $1 themselves. By 2012, the Secretary is to start submitting a yearly report to Congress on what demonstration projects are underway and how well they're doing.

1312648169.0	jauzj	(explainlikeimfive) : Stocks and the Stock Market Explained!	CarlH	1041	177	167	"A number of people have asked questions on ELI5 related to how stocks and stock market work. Here goes:

----

** Part One : Stocks **

First, let's imagine that down the street there is a toy store. Mr. Jones owns the toy store, and he has owned it for the last ten years. The toy store is a company which sells toys and all the kids love to get toys from Mr. Jones' toy store.

Let's suppose we wanted to buy Mr. Jones' toy store from him so that all of the kids would buy toys from us instead. Would we be able to buy it for a dollar? No, of course not. It is worth a lot more than that. How about ten dollars? A hundred dollars?

Well, how exactly would we find out how much we need to pay in order to buy Mr. Jones' toy store? The most important thing to consider is simply how much money is the toy store making. If the toy store is making $100 every day, that means it is making roughly $3,000 (30 days of $100) every month, or $36,000 every year (12 months of $3,000). Let's suppose we are able to figure that the toy store should be able to keep making this much for the next ten years. Then we could consider that the entire toy store is worth $360,000 (which is $36,000 for ten years). 

Now, in practice this is a lot more complicated. But the basic principle is simply to figure out how much money a company can be expected to make in a certain time frame. Fortunately, we don't have to figure it out ourselves. There are big companies whose job is to figure out how much other companies are worth, and they do all of the hard work for us. They will tell us just how much Mr. Jones' toy store is really worth, and then we can decide to buy it or not.

So, let's consider that the toy store is worth $360,000. If we want to buy it (and if he is willing to sell it), we can pay Mr. Jones that much money and now the toy store is ours!

Now, this is all well and good if we have $360,000 and we want to own the entire company. But let's suppose we only have half that much, we have $180,000. What can we do now? Well, as long as Mr. Jones is willing, we can buy *half* of his company instead of the whole thing.

This means that we will own 50% or half of the company, and he will own the other half. That means that instead of all of the money from selling toys going to Mr. Jones, half will go to him and the other half to us. 

Another way of saying that we own 50% of the company is to say that we own 50% of the stock in a company. When a company is set up in a way that you can buy pieces of it, those pieces are called stock. There are two ways to think about stock: percentages, and shares.

What we just talked about are percentages. We can buy 50% of the shares in Mr. Jones' toy company for $180,000. Similarly, we could buy 10% of the shares in Mr. Jones' toy company for $36,000 (assuming the total value of the company was $360,000), or we could buy 1% of the shares for $3,600, and so on.

When you hear people talk about stocks, you will hear them talk about shares of stock. What exactly does this mean? Well, let's imagine that Mr. Jones has a lot of people who want to buy a piece of his company. What he can do is say ""Hey everyone, I have 100 different pieces of my company for sale.""

In this example, there are 100 total pieces he has for sale, each one being worth 1% of the stock. To buy all 100 pieces would cost you $360,000 and this would mean you own the entire company. This would mean that whenever the company makes money, you get all of the money. But let's suppose we only have $3,600 to use. This means all we can afford is *one* piece of his company, but that one piece is worth 1% which means that every time the company makes a hundred dollars, we will get one dollar.

So in this example, Mr. Jones' looks at the situation and realizes it is very hard to find people to buy pieces of his company, because each piece costs $3,600 which is a lot of money. So he decides rather than just have 100 pieces, or shares, he is going to have a thousand pieces! Now it takes ten shares to have 1% of the company, but each share is only $360. That is a lot more affordable. He could even decide to make 10,000 shares which means that you could buy a share for only $36.

So this is the basic concept. Companies cut their value into pieces, or shares, and then sell the shares to people who will buy them. The people who buy shares are called ""investors"" and the act of buying a share is called ""investing"". This means that they are buying shares in a company because they think that eventually they will make back more than what they paid, because they are getting a piece of all of the money that the company makes.

When a company is enormous, worth billions of dollars, even a thousand shares is simply not enough. They need to have many, many shares in order to make sure that shares are affordable. Some companies have millions of shares of stock.

Now, we have covered one aspect of what it means to own stock in a company. You are able to keep some of the money the company makes, based on how many shares you own. But when you own part of a company, you don't just get some of the money it makes. You also get to make decisions. Everyone who has shares in a company has the right to vote for what the company will do next. The amount of voting power you have is equal to the percentage of shares you have. 

Imagine that a company is owned by three people: Billy, Melissa, and James. Imagine that Billy owns 40% of the total shares, and that Melissa and James each own 30%, which is less than what Billy owns. 

Let's suppose that the toy company is trying to decide whether to sell a certain toy. Billy thinks it is a good idea, but Melissa and James think it is a bad idea. Well, even though Billy has more shares of stock in the company, and more voting power, he will still be *out voted* by both Melissa and James. This is because together Melissa and James have 60% compared to Billy's 40%. 

When a company has a lot of share holders (people who own stock in the company), they will have meetings called shareholder meetings. In these meetings, everyone gets to vote based on the shares they own. The company will do whatever the prevailing vote decides.

So then, this brings up a question. What if there are a lot of people who own shares, but one of them owns more than half of all the shares? Would that person be able to out-vote everyone else, no matter how many other people there are? 

The answer is yes. If a single person owns more than half of all the shares, then they have what is called ""controlling interest"" in the company. This means that they can decide anything for the company and outvote everyone else. 

----

** Part Two : The Stock Market **

So by now you should have a pretty good idea of what stock is. Now let's imagine that there is also a video game company owned by Mr. Smith. Now, Mr. Smith's company is doing a lot better than Mr. Jones'. We had said that Mr. Jones' company is worth $360,000 based on how much it is expected to make over ten years, but Mr. Smith's is worth twice that! His video game company is worth $720,000. 

Let's imagine that Mr. Jones' company has 100 total shares of stock, each valued at $3,600 per share. Let's also imagine that Mr. Smith's company also has 100 total shares of stock, each valued at $7,200 per share. This means that if we had $7,200 we could choose to either buy two shares in Mr. Jones' toy company, or one share in Mr. Smith's video game company. 

Let's suppose that we already own two shares of stock in Mr. Jones' toy company. Our two shares are worth $7,200 which is enough to buy one share of stock in Mr. Smith's company. We looked at both companies, and we decided that Mr. Smith's company seems like it is doing the best, so we decide to sell our two shares in Mr. Jones' toy company, and buy one share of stock in Mr. Smith's company. And this is the basics of stock trading.

Now here is where things get interesting. How much a company is really worth *changes* constantly. Mr. Jones' company has been making $100 every day for ten years, but all of last year his company was only making $50 per day! Is it still worth $360,000 ? Maybe it is losing value, or maybe it is just going through a rough period. If we owned stock in the company, we would have to decide which it is. If we decide the company is losing value, then we will probably want to sell our stocks and buy stocks in a company that is doing better. 

There are a *lot* of reasons to assume that a company is doing better, or worse. We might have heard a rumor that Mr. Jones' toy company, even though it has only been making $50/day is about to start selling a really, really cool toy. We say ""Wow, if he sells that toy lots of kids will buy it!"" and so we decide to buy a lot of stock because we think that the stock is actually worth more than Mr. Jones says. 

Similarly, we might have heard a rumor that an even better toy company is going to be opening up a store right next door to Mr. Jones' toy store. In this case, we might say ""Oh no, we have a lot of shares of stock in Mr. Jones' toy company, and we better sell it fast! If we don't, we will lose money because the kids will all shop at the new toy store instead."" You can see that emotion plays a big role in this.  

Now let's imagine that instead of two companies (Mr. Jones' Toy Company, and Mr. Smith's Video Game Company), there are hundreds of companies. Let's also imagine there are thousands of people all trading stock in each company at the same time. Now you have what is called a stock exchange. If you take the value of *all* of the companies and add them together, and then divide that by the total number of companies in your stock exchange, you get an average that you can track over time to see how well on average all of the companies are doing.

Let's suppose that all of the companies combined are worth a million dollars, and that there are only ten total companies in the stock exchange. Then we would say that the average value is a million divided by ten which is $100,000. Remember though that how much companies are worth changes over time, so the very next day it might turn out that all ten companies combined are now worth two million dollars, which means our average is now $200,000. 

If we keep track of this average over time, we can create a graph. We can watch this graph to get a good feel for how the companies in the stock exchange are doing. This can also help us decide whether or not investing in more companies is a good idea, or a bad idea. 

There you have it, the basics of stocks and the stock market. I hope you enjoyed it.

2. A committee will be made which needs to plan more cuts by November. None of the drastic thing the parties wanted- taxing the rich for democrats, and cuts to entitlements for republicans-have been made yet. The parties and the president hope the committee will decide to do these things.
Hope this helps!

Glossary-
A default would mean our government wouldn't be able to pay it's debts. This would make investors feel like we wouldn't be able to pay them, and would pull out, which would be bad for our economy.

###**Please read this post before opening the application.**

After becoming a default modteam, we understand that there will need to be more moderation to ensure that the quality of posts is high and that spam is reduced.

We are looking for multiple experienced moderators for our team.
If you do not meet the following criteria, please save yourself and us the time and do not apply to be a moderator of ELI5:

* Redditor for at least six months
* Knowledge of the reddit moderation tools
* Very familiar with the rules and content of ELI5

If you do not meet the above criteria, please withhold your application. For those that meet all of the above requirements and who are interested, please [click here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10TdprkrkZMQOojurOwd74-B8lF8UeX9l1JlXbSSk-d4) to access the application. Please only fill out one application.

The application process will be multiple steps. We will likely give limited moderating privileges for around a month or so, and then decide whether users will be a full-fledged moderator after that point-- but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

We likely won't be able to contact everyone who applied when we decide, so we apologize in advance for that. Be on the lookout for a mod post update though.

Do not post an application in the comments of this thread or via modmail.

There are concepts on here that I'm sure many redditor parents have a difficult time explaining to their kids. It would be cool if we could all get together and design some children books similar to how we do the Redditor Magazine. 

It could be a .pdf file that parents print and read to their kids as bedtime short stories. Educate the little kids with tough questions they all have, while making it fun: [**we could start here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j86h2/the_fiveyearolds_guide_to_the_galaxy/)

I have enough time to execute this, but I'd also like someone to help me out a bit if anyone else has the free time and would like the task. Message me. 

I'll make a list soon of illustrators and writers.

As I understand it, the idea is to not only explain the idea simply, but to explain it in a way a child *could* grasp. It gives someone completely clueless the fundamentals of understanding, which he can then build off of. If you look at AskReddit (r/answers fits here as well), it is essentially a place where people who don't know about a thing, or want to know more about a thing, get it explained to them in a simple way, a way they can understand. I've seen answers in this subreddit that could easily have been in AskReddit OR r/answers.

People say that explaining some concepts that simply is impossible. I was inclined to agree, but then I saw [**this**](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j2ekw/how_did_we_go_from_binary_to_assembly_language_to/c28n0cr). Amazing. It was an easy read, and gave me the basic understanding of something that I thought would be too complex to explain to a child. Unfortunately, [**this**](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j2ekw/how_did_we_go_from_binary_to_assembly_language_to/c28l6by) is more highly upvoted. I looked at that and saw a bunch of numbers and acronyms and thought, ""ugh, never mind. I'm not really that interested in programming."" I'm sure it's well thought out, and very informative, but it doesn't follow the spirit of this subreddit. I downvoted the latter comment, and upvoted the first one I linked to (chipbuddy's). I realise this is against reddiquette, but it makes sense in this subreddit. I don't mind that those comments exist, I just wish that people realise why this subreddit was created and relegate comments like that a little bit lower. Perhaps after I read chipbuddy's very well child-tailored explanation, I would be more inclined to read the more complicated one. We need to self-moderate a little bit better.

TL;DR - AskReddit and r/answers are for straightforward and/or simple explanations. ELI5 is for explanations a child *could* understand.

Edited to include r/answers due to demonawid's critique. He's right, but I believe my point is still valid.

**Edit 2**: I love that we have a lot of discussion going on this. I've been busy today, so I haven't had time to join in as much as I'd like. I hear those who are disagreeing with me, you all have valid points. However, I do want to make one thing clear. I am not suggesting that a child couldn't comprehend what a kind of metal is or what a certain element is called. If you explain it to Eli in the right way, he'd definitely comprehend it. The ""right way"" is what I'm getting at. I believe my fist linked comment explaining programming languages is not the right way to explain it to Eli. It does not need to be an analogy, but that certainly helps with very complicated answers.

**To those who believe that I, and the others who agree, are being overly nit picky**: If this subreddit involves people asking questions and getting answers [like these](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j2ekw/how_did_we_go_from_binary_to_assembly_language_to/c28l6by), how is it any different from r/answers? To remain distinct, this subreddit has to stay in the ""a child *could* comprehend it"" niche.

Would nothing be inside and air just get sucked into the box? I'm assuming whatever gas inside the box before opening it would be lost after being exposed in space. I'm expecting a very simple answer and I'm probably just very stupid.

1319637025.0	lpoas	"A note from your friendly, ELI5 mods: Please, no more meta, ""what ELI5 is/isn't"" posts or arguments. We'll be removing them."	bossgalaga	1200	535	85	"Hey guys! Just wanted to say a few words here.

In just a few months, ELI5 has turned from a crazy, middle-of-the-night idea I had during this past summer off from teaching...into an explosively popular subreddit that's now bigger than I had ever hoped (hitting 50,000 subscribers a few weeks ago.) I'm still amazed by that -- but I'm even more amazed at what an amazing community this has become, and how much knowledge is being shared. This could not have been possible without all you amazing subscribers -- as well as our truly dedicated and fantastic mod staff. I'd dare anyone to browse around ELI5 for twenty minutes and not come away having learned something new - or been taught to think of something in a new way. That's pretty awesome.

Having said that, I want to clarify what myself and the rest of the mods believe ELI5 exactly is and is not. And while we understand that the idea and subreddit itself will continue to grow and evolve, there are some things we would like to clarify:

-- As we say in the sidebar, ELI5 is a place to receive simple explanations to complicated issues. ""Simple explanations"" **does NOT ALWAYS HAVE TO BE an allegory or metaphor.** (However, if this works best for the explanation, great!) Point is: *As long as the explanation is simple and as thorough as possible, it belongs in ELI5.*

-- A word about the whole ""five-year-old"" thing: Yes, I named this place ""Explain Like I'm Five"", but really, it's more of a title to be catchy. **Please, please stop arguing about what a five-year-old would understand...or would ask about.** We all know most five-year-olds wouldn't ask questions about politics, or sex, or economics -- but those are some of our best posts, and fall wholly within the spirit of ELI5. Believe me, I work on a campus where there are actual five-year-olds running around, and trust that you would NOT want this subreddit to be dominated by those kinds of questions (or answers.)

-- For goodness sakes, if you disagree with a submission, please use the downvote button. We don't need to continue the infighting about what belongs here and what doesn't. If you disagree with the LOGIC behind an *answer*, please feel free to reply with a rebuttal! But...we don't need to argue here and be uncivilized. It's ""Explain Like I'm Five""...not Act Like I'm Five.

Remember, subreddits work because they're ultimately controlled by YOU, the community. YOU ultimately decide -- via upvotes and downvotes -- what's good content and what isn't. It's not our job as mods to police you -- and you honestly don't need it. You've proven yourselves to be an incredibly intelligent community. The VAST majority of content in ELI5 is awesome, in terms of both questions and answers. This is, at its heart, a place to ask questions without fear of judgment or ridicule. That means ANY question. Think it's better suited for AskReddit, another subreddit or maybe not even Reddit at all? Cool. Downvote and move on. I say again: **If you don't like a submission, downvote and move on.** Enough infighting. Allow the system to work. It really, truly does as a whole.

On another note -- **if you LOVE  a submission or answer, don't forget to submit it into our ongoing compilation**, [""The Five Year Old's Guide To The Galaxy!](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/ldbf4/calling_all_fiveyearolds_submit_your_favorite/) You can find a link to submit and view in the sidebar any time you visit ELI5.

I want to thank those of you who have contacted us recently and asked for a statement such as this to go out -- as well as those of you who've made the meta posts to begin with, too. Your mods will always be here to listen to each of you who've made this place so great, and hopefully this note lets you know that our non-interventionist stance on most posts does NOT mean we're not keeping an eye on this place. We're right here, loving this subreddit as much as the crazy day it started. We appreciate every message and every post, and will continue to strive to do our best to keep ELI5 a place of learning and discovery.

**To that end: As of today, we will be removing any meta, ""what is the nature of ELI5"" posts. Questions -- and the occasional ""unsolicited explanation"" posts -- only, please.**

I hope this note has cleared up things a little, our mission, our goals, all of that. As always, feel free to message the mods as a whole or me personally if you have any questions or comments.

**Thank you guys for being kick-ass ELI5'ers.**

With gratitude,

&gt;It is to stop people from using bots to up vote their own posts. What it does specifically is stops them from knowing if their vote has been ignored or not.
If they had a bot, and up-voted a post, and the post number stayed the same. Then it would be obvious that the bot was ignored and then they could work towards circumventing it.
&gt;However, if instead of just ignoring it, it gives the post one up-vote and one down-vote. They wouldn't be able to tell if someone just down voted it, or if it was the number fuzzing program.
&gt;So put simply:
&gt;It constantly moves the numbers around so you can't tell if your vote actually counted or not, but it totally does count unless you have blocked by spam protection.

Anyone want to suggest exceptional answers to these or any other *frequently* asked questions that they've come across, and then maybe we can bug the mods to add them into the FAQ?

Oh my, so many questions. And they wanted citations... so I went and looked up page numbers in the actual document. And as I read it, I started thinking... what if I just go down the bill and talk about each section, in order, in a way that a layman might be able to understand?

It's a huge undertaking. The [current version of the bill](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf) is 974 pages long. Yikes! However, I think that by summarizing and simplifying, we can whittle that down to something more manageable. But it's going to take a while to do it. Maybe a week. Maybe more. If enough people are interested, I'll keep adding to this until I'm finished.

So, without further ado, here goes...

(**Note: I am NOT an expert! I'm just a guy. If I have made an error on any of this, please let me know!**)

(**Note: Unlike my previous post, for the sake of clarity and continuity, any references to page numbers will be referring to the PDF file, not the page number in the document**)

**[Page 1](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=1)** - Title page

**[Page 2](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=2)** - Disclaimers 'n stuff. Technically, this is a condensed version of the bill. I guess the actual legal version has a lot more legalese... or something.

**[Pages 3-32](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=3)** - Table of Contents

**[Page 32, Sec. 1001](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=32)** - Alters another bill (The Public Health Service Act), just to make room for the additions this bill is going to make. So when you read that other bill, it makes sense and doesn't look like a bunch of stuff was just tacked on at the end.

**[Page 33, Sec. 2711](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=33)** - Says that insurers can't have lifetime limits on the amount of care customers can get, and that starting in 2014, they can't have yearly limits either. So you get as much care as you need.

**[Page 33, Sec. 2712](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=33)** - No more ""rescissions"". In other words, Insurers can't just drop customers once they get sick. The only time they can drop a customer is if that customer commits fraud.

**[Page 33, Sec. 2713](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=33)** - Insurance plans need to include preventive care (colonoscopies, mammagrams, immunizations, etc.) without any extra costs (like co-pays). I should note that this section also includes something that led to a bit of controversy - It says that health insurance must include preventive care for women supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration. And the Health Resources and Services Administration, on the recommendation of the independent Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science, has determined that preventive care for women should include access to, amongst other things, contraception. Insurers *must* provide these services, and *cannot* require a copay for them. They are paid for by the insurance company. On February 10, 2012 (or February 15th, if you go by the header in the document), the Department of Health and Human Services issued [this](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-02-15/pdf/2012-3547.pdf) document, detailing its enforcement of this section. It clarifies that churches are exempt from being required to provide coverage for contraception, and that insurers are to create plans specifically for religiously-owned businesses, like Catholic hospitals, so that employees still get contraceptive coverage through their employer without *any* of the costs being paid by the employer *or* the employee.

**[Page 34, Sec. 2714](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=34)** - Insurance plans need to cover dependents up to the age of 26

**[Page 35, Sec. 2715](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=35)** - A year after the law was passed, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would need to get together with National Association of Insurance Commissioners to establish standards for the insurance industry. This is basically to make sure that everyone is using the same terms, the same language, and is providing the same information to customers, so customers have a better idea how to compare one policy to another.

**[Page 37, Sec. 2715A](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=37)** - From now on, insurers must, in a clear, easy-to-understand format, make a bunch of information public: What their policies are, how many people are using their plans, how many claims they deny, financial information, etc.

**[Page 37, Sec. 2716](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=37)** - Refers to rules in another document, the Internal Revenue Code, but it looks like it's just making sure insurers don't give preferential treatment to rich people. I'm guessing this means a more expensive plan might cover more stuff, but wouldn't let the rich guy cut ahead of you in line at the doctor's office. Or something.

**[Page 38, Sec. 2717](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=38)** - 2 years after the law passed, the Secretary of Health and Human Services needs to establish rules for how insurers will report, on a yearly basis, the quality of care given under their plans, to be made available to the public online. This includes stuff relating to wellness and prevention programs (healthy eating, anti-smoking, etc.), as well as a big section making it clear that customers aren't supposed to be asked about gun ownership (in case someone thinks it might be a good idea to factor that into their reporting).

**[Page 40, Sec. 2718](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=40)** - Insurance companies need to make public how much they spend on insurance claims, and what they make in profits. Starting in 2011, if their costs (and risks, and overhead, etc.) is less than 80-85% of the money they make, they need to send rebates out to their customers. Basically, they're not allowed to do price-gouging to make obscene profits.

**[Page 42, Sec. 2719](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=42)** - Insurers need to offer customers the ability to appeal a claim that was denied. This appeal process will be monitored under an external review process to make sure it's doing what it's supposed to.

**[Page 43, Sec. 2719A](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=43)** - Makes sure that customers can decide their own doctors, and that if their insurance covers emergency care, customers can go to any emergency room without having to worry whether their insurance will cover that specific emergency room. Basically, this section insures that customers still have freedom of choice where they get their medical care.

**[Page 46, Sec. 1002](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=46)** - Adds the next part to a different bill, the Public Health Service Act

**[Page 46, Sec. 2793](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=46)** - The Secretary of Health and Human Services will offer grants to states so that the states can have a Consumer Service programs that will investigate problems customers have with insurance, help to spread information, answer questions, and help to facilitate appeals processes.

**[Page 47, Sec. 1003](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=47)** - Adds the next part to a different bill, the Public Health Service Act

**[Page 47, Sec. 2794](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=47)** - The Secretary of Health and Human Services will decide what constitutes an ""unreasonable"" increase in premiums, and conduct an annual review of increases in premiums to look for these. Insurers must explain their reasons for any such unreasonable increases *before* making them, and must make this information available to the public. If any insurer increases premiums too much or too fast, it may be dropped from ""exchange"" programs (more on this later).

**[Page 49, Sec. 1004](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=49)** - This is just detailing when some of the earlier stuff should happen. It's already all done.

**[Page 49, Sec. 1101](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=49)** - The Secretary of Health and Human Services will make a ""high-risk pool"" insurance program for people with pre-existing conditions, to make sure they can get insurance right now. The program ends in 2014 (because in 2014, insurers can't refuse anyone with a pre-existing condition).

**[Page 52, Sec. 1102](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=52)** - Gives a reimbursement to insurance plans that provide health insurance for early retirees

**[Page 55, Sec. 1103](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=55)** - Create a website ( [http://www.healthcare.gov/](http://www.healthcare.gov/) ) to help people find health insurance in their state, and give them information about options available to them.

**[Page 56, Sec. 1104](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=56)** - Making changes to a few other bills, The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and the Social Security Act, to add definitions and clarify the wording in some sections, and to specify that the paperwork people have to fill out should be clear, concise, and easy-to-understand, as well as to incorporate the use of medical cards used with electronic databases. Basically, this whole section is changing the wording in a few other bills so that all of the bills make things simple and easy for people to fill out paperwork (or simply use a medical card) at hospitals and stuff. Any health plans that don't follow these new rules for clarity will have to pay a fee.

**[Page 63, Sec. 1105](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=63)** - This is just detailing when some of the earlier stuff should happen. It's already all done.

**[Page 64, Sec. 1201](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=64)** - This one is changing another bill, the Public Health Service Act, by adding in the following section.

**[Page 64, Sec. 2704](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=64)** - Starting in 2014, No more turning people down due to ""pre-existing conditions"". This is already in effect (as of 6 months after this bill passed) for anyone under the age of 19.

**[Page 65, Sec. 2701](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=65)** - Starting in 2014, the only things about you that insurers can take into consideration when determining your premium rates are whether you want to cover your family or just you, what your age is, whether or not you use tobacco, and other factors to be determined by each state (unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services believes a state's ""rating area"" to be inadequate, in which that rating area may be changed).

**[Page 65, Sec. 2702](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=65)** - Starting in 2014, Insurers must accept *everyone* who applies for coverage.

**[Page 66, Sec. 2703](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=66)** - Starting in 2014, Insurers must renew coverage for everyone who has it.

**[Page 66, Sec. 2705](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=66)** - Starting in 2014, Insurers can't restrict you from getting a plan based on past illnesses, genetic history, a disability, previous health care you've gotten, because you were the victim of domestic violence... basically, your personal health history is off-limits when it comes to insurers deciding what plans you can apply for.

**[Page 70, Sec. 2706](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=70)** - Starting in 2014, If a doctor or hospital is willing to work with an insurer, the insurer has to let them.

**[Page 71, Sec. 2707](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=71)** - Reiterating that the plans offered have to cover the stuff specified by the other sections of this bill.

**[Page 71, Sec. 2708](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=71)** - Starting in 2014, Waiting periods can't be longer than 90 days.

**[Page 71, Sec. 2709](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=71)** - This has to do with ""Clinical Trials"", stuff that's not ready for mass use yet, and that is still being tested. Basically, it's saying that starting in 2014, people should have access to that sort of trial if they want, and that their insurer shouldn't be able to screw with their insurance plans because they choose to participate in one.

**[Page 74, Sec. 1251](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=74)** - Says that when this law passed, no one had to change their plans. They could if they wanted, but they could totally keep their current plan if they like it.

**[Page 75, Sec. 1252](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=75)** - Says that the changes this law makes apply to *all* health plans companies offer, not just some.

**[Page 75, Sec. 1253](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=75)** - The Secretary of Labor needs to make a yearly report to Congress on self-insured employers.

**[Page 76, Sec. 1254](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=76)** - A year after this law passes, The Secretary of Health and Human Services needs to write a report on group health plans.

**[Page 76, Sec. 1255](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=76)** - You know the dozen or so ""In 2014""s I've put in a bunch of the recent bullet-points? Well, this is the part that specified they happen in 2014, with the exception of a few parts that start sooner.

**[Page 77, Sec. 1301](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=77)** - This section talks about what a plan needs to be in order to be ""qualified"" (basically, okay for an insurer to sell). It needs to be certified for the requirements of the insurance exchange it's going to be in (more on the exchanges later), it needs to have the features described in the next section, needs to be sold by a licensed insurer, needs to be sold at the same rate regardless of whether it's sold directly or in an exchange, etc.

**[Page 78, Sec. 1302](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=78)** - The last section talked about what a plan needs to be, but this one talks about what needs to be *in* it. And that's a lot of ground to cover, so bear with me. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is going to determine what the minimum levels need to be for everything, but this section outlines that by saying that health insurance plans must cover bare minimums of ambulatory services, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health services, drugs, rehabilitative services, laboratory services, preventative services, and pediatric services that include oral and vision care. This section also goes into detail on just how the Secretary is to determine those minimum levels (be mindful of different types of people, be balanced, etc.). This section *also* limits how big deductibles can get starting in 2015 (no bigger than $2000 for individuals and $4000 for couples). On top of that, this establishes that plans should fall into Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum levels, with each corresponding to a different level of benefits. For Bronze, insurers pay for 60% of the costs of the benefits, Silver is 70%, Gold is 80% and Platinum is 90%. A plan that's not one of those could still be okay if it's a Catastrophic plan, which is only for people under 30 or with special tax exemptions, and it only has to cover three primary care visits. Additionally, any plan created for adults must also be available for children under 18.

Whew! That was a long one! Okay, let's move on...

**[Page 83, Sec. 1303](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=83)** - A state may choose to fund plans that include abortion coverage, or they may not. It's up to each state to decide that. Basically, the folks who wrote the bill knew what a hot-button issue abortion was, and they wrote this section to pass the buck on to state lawmakers without siding one way or another.

**[Page 87, Sec. 1304](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=87)** - This section defines a bunch of terms.

Okay, now we're about to get into health insurance exchanges, which allow plans to compete across different areas. The idea, if I'm getting this right, is that by having more insurance companies competing across a larger area, prices will be driven down due to competition. As I understand it, this is what they ultimately ended up doing instead of having a ""public option"" (optional state-run insurance to compete with the others). Since the public option got shot down before the bill was passed, this was seen as another way to encourage more competition in the market.

It bears mention, that in the 6/28/12 [Supreme Court ruling](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf) on this bill, it was declared that states are not required to establish health insurance exchanges, and that they cannot be penalized for refusing to do so by reducing the funding they get for Medicare and Medicaid. However, if any states choose to opt-out of the creation of these exchanges, the Secretary of Health and Human Resources may simply create the exchanges for those states directly (or even go as far as to create a multi-state exchange encompassing any number of states that refuse to create their own). This is just speculation, of course, but in any case, the court decision shouldn't greatly impact the creation of these exchanges.

**[Page 88, Sec. 1311](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=88)** - Another big one. This section sets aside money to the states so they can start up health insurance exchanges. The Secretary of Health and Human Services determines how much to keep giving the states based on how much progress they're making. States only have until 2015 to get their act together, though - after that they get no money. However, states *must* have something ready by 2014. States can choose to require insurers to have benefits that go above and beyond what this law requires, but they have to figure out how to pay for anything they come up with that requires more government money. by 2015, the exchanges need to be self-funding. States can even team up to make multi-state exchanges if they want.

**[Page 99, Sec. 1312](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=99)** - Individuals can get any plan they qualify for. If you qualify for it, you can get it, if you don't, you can't. This section seems to be talking about different ways people can get insurance (through employment, through a broker, etc.), and making sure they get it. Also, Congress has to make use of the same plans us ordinary taxpayers have.

**[Page 102, Sec. 1313](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=102)** - States need to keep track of the money these insurance exchanges are using, make sure they're working right financially, and watch out for fraud.

**[Page 104, Sec. 1321](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=104)** - The Secretary of Health and Human Services is to set the standards that these insurance exchanges are supposed to follow. If any state fails to follow them satisfactorily, fails to get it set up in time, or chooses not to do it at all, the Secretary will set one up for them.

**[Page 105, Sec. 1322](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=105)** - This sets up the rules, as well as instructions for loans and grants, for the creation of non-profit, member-run insurers called Co-ops. Basically, what credit unions are to banks, this aims to be for traditional insurance companies. This section aims to make it easier for a bunch of people to band together to start their own non-profit insurance company to provide insurance all the people who banded together. The idea is to give people more options, and more competition in the market.

**[Page 111, Sec. 1323](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=111)** - This option is stricken and no longer exists. Looks like it was probably the public option back before it was kicked off of this bill.

**[Page 111, Sec. 1323 (same number, different section) ](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=111)** - Allocates money specifically for territories that aren't states, like Puerto Rico.

**[Page 112, Sec. 1324](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=112)** - This says that Co-ops have to work under the same laws as normal insurance companies.

**[Page 112, Sec. 1331](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=112)** - This allows the government to create a low-cost insurance option for people who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid, but who still make less than 200% of the poverty line (which is a number that depends on your age and how many are in your household, but this amount, at its lowest is a little over $20,000/year).

**[Page 117, Sec. 1332](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=117)** - If any state can come up with their own plan, one which gives citizens the same level of care at the same price as the PPACA, they can ask the Secretary of Health and Human Services for permission to do their plan instead of the PPACA. So if they can get the same results without, say, the mandate, they can be allowed to do so. Vermont, for example, has expressed a desire to just go straight to single-payer.

**[Page 119, Sec. 1333](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=119)** - In 2013, states can work with insurers to allow them to make plans available in multiple states with different laws and regulations

**[Page 120, Sec. 1334](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=120)** - A different way for an insurer to do a multi-state plan.

**[Page 124, Sec. 1341](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=124)** - Starting in 2014, states must either create or work with an already-existing non-profit reinsurance agency. Reinsurance agencies basically buy insurance plans from insurers when they are deemed to be high-risk. This helps to keep premiums for other customers down, since otherwise insurers would have to raise prices to offset that risk. This section talks about some of the rules for these sorts of agencies. 50-100 medical conditions are to be identified as high-risk conditions that insurers can offer up to reinsurance agencies. Partly to offset the risk these agencies are taking by taking on these high-risk customers, reinsurers are tax-exempt.

**[Page 127, Sec. 1342](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=127)** - In 2014-2016, the government will create ""Risk corridors"", basically saying that in the first few years while insurers adjust to all these new rules, the government will help with some of the risk associated with insurance payouts.

**[Page 128, Sec. 1343](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=128)** - Each state will charge insurers who take on less risk, and make payments to insurers who take more risk, acting as an equalizer so that the companies that succeed aren't just the ones who cater mostly to demographics with a low amount of risk.

**[Page 129, Sec. 1401](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=129)** - Alters another document, the Internal Revenue Code, by adding the following section.

**[Page 129, Sec. 36B](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=129)** - Starting in 2014, gives a refundable tax credit to everyone who makes too much to qualify for Medicaid, but makes less than 400% of the poverty line (which, again, is based on your age and how many people are in your household). Depending on how much you make, this could save you up to $10,000 a year. A refundable tax credit is basically a discount on your taxes, and if it's more money than you pay in taxes, you actually get the extra money back as a refund. This is the bill's answer to the question ""How will I afford insurance if I make too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to afford insurance on my own?"".

**[Page 138, Sec. 1402](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=138)** - If I'm reading this right, insurers must reduce costs (both co-pays and overall costs) for everyone who makes too much to qualify for Medicaid, but makes less than 400% of the poverty line (which, like I said last time, is based on your age and how many people are in your household). Depending on how much you make, your co-pay costs could be slashed by up to two-thirds the normal price, and your overall costs could be covered up to 94%. If you're an Indian (presumably Native American Indian) making under 300% of the poverty line, you have no co-pay. This section specifically says it only applies to citizens and legal aliens living in the US (so no illegal aliens allowed)

**[Page 142, Sec. 1411](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=142)** - It looks like this section instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to set up a way to check whether people are eligible to buy insurance. It looks like it's basically, in a roundabout way, trying to keep illegal aliens from being qualified for insurance, and setting up penalties for anyone who lies on insurance forms.

**[Page 150, Sec. 1412](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=150)** - This section instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to set up a way to check whether people are eligible for the tax credits and the insurance cost reductions (that ""up to 400%"" stuff). Basically, instructing him to set up a system to determine what people qualify for based on their income. And also, no illegal aliens.

**[Page 152, Sec. 1413](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=152)** - This section instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to set up standard forms and enrollment procedures for state-level programs like Medicaid and Child Health programs.

**[Page 154, Sec. 1414](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=154)** - The Secretary of Health and Human Services is allowed to share relevant tax information with those who need it in order to verify what people qualify for.

**[Page 156, Sec. 1415](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=156)** - All these tax credits and refunds won't count as income. So they won't be taxed or anything.

**[Page 156, Sec. 1416](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=156)** - The Secretary of Health and Human Services is instructed to conduct a study into the possibility of adjusting poverty levels based on where people live. Because making $30,000/year in rural Kansas is a hell of a lot different than making $30,000/year in San Francisco.

**[Page 157, Sec. 1421](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=157)** - Alters another document, the Internal Revenue Code, by adding the following section.

**[Page 157, Sec. 45R](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=157)** - Businesses with 25 or fewer employees can get a tax credit worth up to 50% of the cost of the health care they provide their employees.

The following parts deal with ""The Requirement to Maintain Minimal Essential Coverage"", AKA ""The Mandate"". This is one of the big parts that people have taken issue with, and the very same one that the Supreme Court [recently ruled](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf) *is* constitutional (as long as it's seen as a tax and not a penalty, for all those lawyer-types out there).

**[Page 162, Sec. 1501](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=162)** - This is a big, fat, explanation for the reasons behind The Mandate. Basically, without the mandate, people might just decide not to pay for insurance, which places a huge risk not just on themselves, but the hospitals who will eventually have to treat them when they get sick or injured. The economy loses a ton of money due to uninsured people needing emergency care, which in turn makes insurance premiums more expensive as that cost is passed on. What's more, medical expenses account for 62% of bankruptcies, which introduces even more stress into the economy. And with this bill getting rid of ""pre-existing conditions"", if there was no mandate, people would just wait to buy insurance until they need it, which pretty much defeats the whole point of insurance. In addition, requiring people to get insurance will make millions of people healthier and live longer. Besides, the more healthy people who have insurance, the less of a risk insurers are taking, which lowers everyone's prices.

**[Page 164, Sec. 5000A](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=164)** - This is the actual mandate. If you can afford healthcare (if it costs less than 8% of your income), but don't get it, you will be hit in your tax return with an annual tax of $95, or up to 1% of income, whichever is greater. This will rise to $695, or 2.5% of income, by 2016. This section makes an exception for those with religious exemptions (the Amish), members of Indian tribes, and prison inmates. It also specifies that no one's going to be charged with any crime or anything, it's just a new tax if you don't comply.

**[Page 171, Sec. 6055](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=171)** - Insurers need to tell the government who they're insuring, either directly or through employers, in which case they need to tell the government which employer they're working through too.

**[Page 173, Sec. 1511](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=173)** - This one is changing another bill, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, by adding in the following section.

**[Page 173, Sec. 18A](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=173)** - If an employer has over 200 employees, and offers a health plan to those employees, new employees will be automatically signed up for that health plan, though employees can opt-out if they don't want it.

**[Page 173, Sec. 1512](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=173)** - This one is changing another bill, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, by adding in the following section.

**[Page 173, Sec. 18B](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=173)** - Employers need to notify new employees about their options with health insurance exchanges and tax credits.

**[Page 174, Sec. 1513](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=174)** - Alters another document, the Internal Revenue Code, by adding the following section.

**[Page 174, Sec. 4980H](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=174)** - Starting in 2014, if an employer has over 50 full-time employees and doesn't offer them insurance, the employer has to pay a fee of $2000/year per employee. If they employ part-time employees, their hours are to be added together to see how many full-time employees they'd represent (in other words, it's not a simple head count). The Secretary of Labor is to conduct a report to see what effect this has on employees' wages.

**[Page 178, Sec. 1514](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=178)** - Alters another document, the Internal Revenue Code, by adding the following section.

**[Page 178, Sec. 6056](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=178)** - Employers need to report to the Secretary of Health and Human Resources about the insurance being used by the employees working for them.

**[Page 180, Sec. 1515](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=180)** - Alters another document, the Internal Revenue Code, by adding that you can't get a plan using an insurance exchange through a ""cafeteria plan"" (a plan where you specifically pick what is and isn't covered). I think this is saying that if you're well enough off that you're going to nitpick the details of your insurance policy, you can buy all of the elements of that policy directly.

**[Page 181, Sec. 10108](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=181)** - This section has to do with Free Choice Vouchers. Judging from news reports, it looks like it has since been repealed. It would have required employers to provide these vouchers to employees.

**[Page 181, Sec. 139D](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=181)** - More on Free Choice Vouchers. Again, looks like it was killed off after the bill passed.

**[Page 183, Sec. 1551](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=183)** - Says that this part of the bill uses the same definitions as another bill, the Public Health Service Act.

**[Page 183, Sec. 1552](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=183)** - 30 days after this act passed, the Secretary of Health and Human Services had to publish online all of the authorities he has been given under the act.

**[Page 183, Sec. 1553](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=183)** - The Federal Government, States, and insurers cannot discriminate against doctors and hospitals that refuse to do assisted suicide.

**[Page 184, Sec. 1554](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=184)** - The Secretary of Health and Human Services will not promote regulation that limits peoples' ability to get health care, or limits doctors' ability to communicate with patients.

**[Page 184, Sec. 1555](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=184)** - Any Federal Health Insurance Programs created by this act are optional (anything like Medicare and Medicaid, for example). No one has to join them.

**[Page 184, Sec. 1556](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=184)** - Alters another bill, the Black Lung Benefits Act. From what I can tell, this has to do with health problems suffered by coal miners. It looks like it's extending the dates to cover more recent issues.

**[Page 185, Sec. 1557](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=185)** - Health insurance programs benefiting from Federal credits and subsidies cannot discriminate against anyone based on age, gender, race, etc.

**[Page 185, Sec. 1558](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=185)** - Alters another bill, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, by adding the following section.

**[Page 185, Sec. 18C](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=185)** - Employers can't discriminate against employees that have received tax credits.

**[Page 186, Sec. 1559](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=186)** - The Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services is in charge of administration and implementation of this law, as it pertains to his department.

**[Page 186, Sec. 1560](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=186)** - Names a few random laws and says ""this bill doesn't change any of these laws"".

**[Page 186, Sec. 1561](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=186)** - Alters another bill, the Public Health Service Act, by adding the following section.

**[Page 186, Sec. 3021](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=186)** - 180 days after this bill was passed, a couple of Health Information Technology committees will work to start spreading information and helping people enroll in Health and Human Service programs

**[Page 188, Sec. 1562](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=188)** - The Comptroller General of the United States is directed to conduct a study on the denial of coverage. This section details how he's to go about doing it.

**[Page 189, Sec. 1563](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=189)** - It looks like it's basically saying that when you buy a business, you can't use this bill as an excuse to ignore any of the usual laws when doing so.

**[Page 189, Sec. 1563 (Same number, different section) ](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=189)** - Alters another bill, the Public Health Service Act, by making many small changes. It looks like most of them are either slight alterations and rewordings, additional definitions of terms, and language that fits in better with this bill.

**[Page 196, Sec. 715](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=196)** - Alters another bill, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, by adding that the rules in that document apply to group insurance plans as well as individual insurance plans.

**[Page 196, Sec. 9815 ](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=196)** - Alters another document, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, by adding that the rules in that document apply to group insurance plans as well as individual insurance plans.

**[Page 197, Sec. 1563 (Yet another one with the same number, but a different section) ](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=197)** - This basically just says that the Congressional Budget Office says that this bill will reduce the budget deficit, extend Medicare solvency, increase the Social Security Trust Fund, and have savings in a few other areas. It also says that these savings will go towards those programs and not folded back into the PPACA.

How have ELI5 links dominated the queue on my front page so dramatically?

EDIT:  I should clarify that my actual subreddit subscription total is 33, but there were exactly 10 ELI5 links listed on my front page within the top 50 posts 6 hours ago.

**EDIT2:  I'm getting some great answers from you guys and think I have pieced together a viable solution to this phenomenon.**  

(1) **The algorithm:** A high upvote/downvote ratio and initial momentum are important in calculating a spot in the queue.  There aren't many downvotes here, and there appears to be pretty high momentum.  But I had only noticed this yesterday, what has happened to cause such a recent dramatic change?

(2) **BestOf:**  Given the recent decision to disallow default subs on /r/bestof suddenly ELI5 is the new /r/AskReddit and suddenly there are now a lot of ELI5 posts that rise to the top of bestof which are then highly upvoted here, causing these posts to subsequently rise up my front page queue.  

I think this is the reason for the outlier results, and I thank [pkmnnerdfighter](http://www.reddit.com/user/pkmnnerdfighter) for being the first to point this out to em.  Also [heyitstval](http://www.reddit.com/user/heyitstval) gets props for being the first person I've ever seen to actually link the mythical algorithm for page ranking... I had forgotten it is all open source code.

**FINAL EDIT:**  This has just turned into ELI5ception, as this very post is now on my front page!  Who wants to submit a comment from here to /r/bestof so it completes the cycle?  

Anyhow, for anybody still reading this, head on over to /r/UpliftingNews for a break from the depressing news.  Its a sub I've been growing but there are few comments and everybody here seems like great contributors so I feel no shame plugging it for this brief moment in the limelight.

In 2005 they had the best stock with around 64 bucks a pop and 2008 they just completely crashed. I know it may be due to the recession but still, in the last four years the trend hasn't been that great. 

I'd think the it would recover eventually but even then, its lowest point was in 2011 when it was going for 11 dollars. Despite making high production value games and getting good reviews and great sales, why is EA still in the gutter?

EA's P/E ratio was unrealistically high (of course, some did think that EA would produce several high quality games, and thus were optimistic) but when it failed to deliver EA's stock plummeted.

"	actioncode10	611	194	732	"When I was a kid, my parents told me, ""If your server does a good job, you leave them a little bit of extra money as a thank you."" More importantly, if the service was bad, you left nothing, because *you were not obligated to leave anything*.

Today it seems like tipping has become mandatory, regardless of the quality of service. Is it because ""times are tough"" or has the expectation shifted for some other reason? I know the minimum wage for servers is lower than the standard, but I also know that if their tips doesn't bring them ""up"" to the standard minimum wage, the restaurant is supposed to kick in the difference.

I ask because we went out to eat last night, and the service was horrible. It took over 30 minutes to get our food (even though the place was dead), the order was wrong, and our server *left* in the middle of our service. Maybe her shift was over, but I'm not sure. We had to ask the manager for our ticket, and when we were asked how the experience was, we, well, *told them it was kinda shitty*, and explained why. The manager listened, then when we were leaving, she asked us if we were going to leave our tip on the table or if we wanted to add it to the bill at the register.

I was *dumbfounded* at this, because in my mind, not only was a tip not warranted, but the server had also, you know, *left*. 

The experience just got me wondering. When did the tipping culture in America change? Or, was it always like this, and I've just come to see it for what it is as I've gotten older?

And when the fuck did 30% become the norm? The manager last night honestly tried to tell me that $5 on a $15 bill was *normal*, but I sure as shit wasn't about to leave that much. I left a buck on the table and left. The whole experience was just bizarre.

Wow. Just wow. It's hard for me to believe how much this place has grown and changed in the last two years. We've gone from an idea in the back of /u/bossgalaga's mind (who was upset about the quality of the available explanations of the hot topic ~~de jure~~ du jour: [the U.S. Debt Ceiling](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j2a9k/would_anybody_be_interested_in_a_new_subreddit/)) all the way to the front page as a [default subreddit.](http://blog.reddit.com/2013/07/new-default-subreddits-omgomgomg.html)

Along the way we [smashed the record for fastest-growing community in reddit history,](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j2m3r/congratulations_li5_you_are_the_fastest_growing/) blazing through to 10,000 subscribers in just under five hours, shattering /r/shutupandtakemymoney's previous record of one week. 

Not content to rest on our collective laurels, we went out and earned ourselves a place in /r/weeklyreddit's list of the [Top 25 New Subreddits of 2011](http://www.reddit.com/r/weeklyreddit/comments/nyhla/top_25_subreddits_of_2011/) in the company of such illustrious companions as /r/DepthHub, /r/LifeProTips, /r/GetMotivated, and the always esteemed /r/NSFW_GIF. And we haven't stopped making the world a simpler place since, one question at a time.

-----

So here we are, a half million-member default subreddit on the front page of the front page of the internet. As you can see from our [recent traffic stats,](http://i.imgur.com/Lj5oCYy.png?1) things are starting to change in a big way around here. Your modteam is working tirelessly to make sure that with all these changes, ELI5 stays true to its roots, taking difficult questions and breaking them down to give simple, layman-friendly answers.

To that end, we recently added 9 new moderators to our team, doubling its size so that we can be sure to have eyes everywhere they're needed in the subreddit to keep posts and responses up to snuff. I'd like to take a moment to recognize them and thank them for all the help they've been already: /u/kouhoutek, /u/Al-Fayyad, /u/SecureThruObscure, /u/corpuscle634, /u/_The_Editor_, /u/LoveOfProfit, /u/saltyjohnson, /u/C47man, and /u/I_Cant_Log_Off.

In addition, we're about to begin an overhaul of all our rules and procedures, including both community rules and internal mod rules (there have been some issues raised recently about mods overstepping their bounds which we want to ensure don't happen again). The mod team is going to work to rewrite the rules to make them clearer to follow and enforce and make them stricter or more lenient **as the community wishes.** 

**Within the next 48 hours, we're going to be making an official post asking for your critiques and suggestions as to how to make this subreddit a better place more in line with its founding vision.**

-----

Once again, thank you all for making this subreddit such a great place to work. Even after two years of moderating, I'm still finding new posts every day that surprise me and explanations that teach me something about the world that I didn't know before.

It's been a wild ride so far; I can't wait to see what the next two years will bring. See you at a million,

Dr_M, for the ELI5 Mod Team

Nostromo26	527	142	105	"Sometimes something will jog my memory, but it'll cause a lot of other related memories to be released. For example, I was recently near my childhood home and saw an empty lot that was once a miniature golf course. Upon seeing it I vividly remembered going to a birthday party there when I was about 7 or 8. Not only could I remember the party, but I remembered the name of the boy whose birthday it was, what he looked like, the present I brought him, and I remembered a dumb joke I made when I showed up there.

That sort of thing happens from time to time -- something will jog my memory, but I'll be able to remember a lot of other unrelated things. Sometimes when I see a movie, for instance, I'll be able to remember exactly where I was and who I was with the first time I saw the movie. Or other random memories will just pop into my head uninvited.

So my question is this: Where and how are all those memories being stored in my brain? How can I have things that I'd not thought about for possibly decades come back to me with such clarity? Where have they been hiding all this time?

--Edit--

I am blown away by the broad array of responses, sadly not all explanations correlate with one another. So I thougt I'd summarize the current explanations:

- The lens is round, but the sensor behind the lens is square.
- Lenses are round and the sensor doesn't absorb all the light(would also infer the sensor to be square)
- Lenses circular, because that way they are the easiest to manufacture.
- Square lenses don't focus light well, and circular film would be harder to make.
- The rectangular format was first chosen because what images used to be made on were sheets of glass coated with a film based post process and these were usually sold 8x10
- It's easiest to make pictures rectangular if you are trying to fit as much film as you can into a roll.
- Because paper is square.

1) If you take a trip in an emergency ambulance, who pays for it and who provides it?

2) If somebody collapsed on the street with no ID and it was a medical emergency, would a hospital treat them? Who would pay if they had no medical insurance? 

3) How much is medical insurance? Can you get different levels for cover like you can with cars? (e.g., ""We'll treat you for everything except cancer"")

4) Is it true that people have thought twice about performing first aid such as CPR on people they don't know just in case they get sued?

5) Why do some people have a problem with government providing healthcare when they don't object to it providing schools? (This isn't a rhetorical question, I'm genuinely interested)

6) Is High School (especially late high school) like it is in the movies? Lots of cliques who don't mix, parties at big houses, bullies, well-equipped classrooms etc?

EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect this topic to be so big.

Thanks to the excellent [video](http://www.youtube.com /watch?v=JKTvFhRbBt8) posted by TurbulentTurtle, I have a much better sense of this.

Okay, so I just got back from my first trip to Europe. It was lovely, I had a fantastic time, I met up with some other Americans from time to time. There were really only two things that bothered me. One, everything was much more expensive (I was told this was because there's more money in circulation, i.e. people get paid more, but everything costs more, which is why a bottle of coke is 4 Euro's ($4.25 roughly) but back home it's only a dollar.) Not sure if that's legit or not, I would love if someone could break it down with a little more information, but that's not the meat of my issue.

Gypsies. I went over with a group of Americans, we all stayed in the same remote mountain chalet, and one of the first things I was told (by an american living in Berlin) was avoid the gypsies I was told this several times as we were on our way there. Then at a bus stop, a guy tried to pickpocket me. I noticed, tried to grab him, but he ran off, I tried to report it to the police, but they basically shrugged it off saying there's not much that they can do about the gypsies, especially if nothing was taken.

There was also one lady in a market, she was selling some good looking snack food type stuff, so I thought I'd buy some. When she told me the price it seemed high but not totally unreasonable (not that I'm familiar with Euro's or Franks, so I guess I was an easy mark) an older gentleman came up and told me in rather broken English that she was tipping the scales. She started saying something in German, the old guy chuckled and said she was saying some pretty nasty things to him. I ended up not buying anything from her. The old guy told me I would ""be smart to not deal with the gypsies again"".

Finally on the last night/morning, we had to leave the chalet at 3 in the morning to get to the airport on time for our flight. Our bus rolled up on time, and there was a little car that was following it. The car was crammed full of stuff, and there were two people in it. The bus was at the far side of the parking lot trying to arrange itself, and the small car drove right up to our group, while we waited on the porch. The family (I think it's a family) that ran the chalet had checked us out the previous afternoon, and would clean after we left, they weren't awake at the time, counting on us to use the honor system etc. etc.

Anyway, a very pregnant lady gets out of the car and starts talking to us, quickly adapting to English, which she spoke very well, we politely told her, since it wasn't our chalet, we didn't have the right or authority to let her stay the rest of the night here. She said she had begged a ride from a total stranger, and that this was as far as the man would take her (this was basically the middle of nowhere, a very odd place to limit a drive) then she started feeding us some BS, about how she was a Pentecostal minister, begging her way to a mission in Afghanistan. We politely let her know that that didn't change the amount of ownership we had over the property. Then she got upset, started swearing, sometimes switching to other languages, saying she was twice ordained and where she came from you never reject a holy woman. And she was a sergeant in the US military, and if she were still active we would say ""yes sir"" and be happy to have the opportunity to let her stay there. Needless to say it was pretty funny, we all lined up, saluted her and said ""yes sir"" as she got back into the car and angrily drove off. The man driving the little car almost hit our bus driver, who was now walking up to the chalet. Our bus driver told us that they had been following him since he was dispatched, and that the ""damn gypsies"" would frequently follow tourist buses and try to steal suitcases.

Anyway, I've really only had negative experiences with this particular group of people, but I'm thinking it can't really be that bad? I honestly can't tell if someone's a gypsy just by looking at them, so I figure I probably dealt with some honest gypsies and not known. Anyway, there seems to be a lot of hate, and I can sort of see why, given what I've dealt with, but I feel like I probably don't have a complete or proper feel for the situation, if anyone can explain it, that would be very much appreciated.

[here is the source for the seven year regeneration information.](http://stemcell.stanford.edu/research/)

/u/thisisntnamman explained quite well &amp; has the most upvotes, here's the answer:

""Your skin has layers. The two big ones are the epidermis and the dermis. The epidermis is the highly cellular one with lots of cell division and shedding. The dermis is blow that layer. It is not nearly as cellular. There is a lot of non-cell connective tissue, fibers and elastics that hold skin together and support all the other little organs in skin. (Latin of the day: epi = above, or above dermis)

A tattoo doesn't put ink in your epidermis. So skin division doesn't effect it. The point of the tattoo needed is to drive the ink below your epidermis into the dermis. Not into any cells but into that fibrous tissue between cells (there's a lot in the dermis). Once there it's stuck. There isn't much cell division or circulation or fluid movement to wash the ink out. So it stays there for a long time. Oh it will degrade, some ink does shed, the dermis breaks down as we get older. So you do loose the vibrant colors and fine shapes.

Henna is an example of ink into the epidermis, it looks pretty but is shed off after only a week."""	t5_2sokd	True
