I enjoyed being part of the Braves 1999 World Series and three straight National League East titles from 1998-2001. 

Since retiring, I’ve been working as a radio analyst for ESPN Radio and Sporting News Radio. You can also find me on http://www.Thuzio.com which you can book me for appearances, video messages, coaching and more. Ask me anything.

I have said some pretty terrible things about you in my life. I'm a Yankees fan. A big one. I'm sure you've said some pretty terrible things about me and my kind too. What exists between our two cities is a fabled rivalry. We scream and we cheer and we fight for our cities, for our teams. It's a passion that without which, this rivalry could never be. Does anyone think that this sort of fan could be in a rivalry with anyone less passionate than themselves? No shot. It wouldn't hold up.
I was there when you guys beat us and went on the break records and win the World Series for the first time since 1918. To myself, and certainly not out loud, I was glad for you. You played well and you deserved it. As a dedicated sports fan, I knew how much that meant. As a Yankees fan, having seen my team win the World Series before, I couldn't even begin to fathom how amazing this must be for you, Boston fans, a first in most of your lifetimes. I came to learn later that this was the opinion of a majority of Yankee fans. We weren't happy. Far from it. But you are fans, long suffering, loyal fans. And you deserved it. And we got that.
I was in New York on 9/11. The fear, the confusion, the panic, all of it is burned into my memory. What happened yesterday, Boston, what happened to you and your city, and in the moments after and what will come to be the days and months and years after, it's not ok, and it’s not easy. I'm not going to tell you that you will rise above and see the good in the people and your city, because it's been less than 24 hours and it's already evident. It's very evident.
But here's what I do know. Here's what I've learned from Red Sox fans and Yankees fans. Boston and New York have this in common; we are strong, we are passionate, we don't hold back, we love our cities. We love our people. You come to our town, and you try to break us? F you. We will mourn the losses and we will clean up our streets. We will cry and we try to explain to our children why this happened. But have no doubt, no one comes into our towns and breaks us.
For 86 years, you believed, almost every year, that your Red Sox were going to win the World Series. You want to mess with that sort of passion? I've watched you proudly march into our stadium with your Boston gear and cheer with definitive belief that you were champions with nothing more sometimes than faith and love for your city and your players. These are the people of Boston.
My heart hurts for you right now Boston. But you know what? There's this thought that keeps coming back to me. I just keep thinking, as evil as the person or people are that did this, they are just as stupid. You're gonna mess with that city?? On their day? I'm certain there's a special place in hell for the perpetrator of this attack, but what I'm even more certain of is this city just got stronger. And I didn't think that was possible. My sports analogy might seem trite but if I have learned anything as a lifetime Yankees fan, it's that Boston will not take this lying down. You are proud and you are strong. Go Boston. Go Sox. Go Celtics. Go Bruins. Go Patriots. I'm with you Boston. We all are. We are the same.
Sincerely, 
Yankees fan, Boston rival, and friend."	t5_2qrrr	True

1360981671.0	18m87h	An open letter to MLB:  It makes me sad that you don't care about me	onepedro57	51	6	21	"Dear MLB,

I am a gigantic cable company and want to pay you millions of dollars.

Did I get your attention?  Good.   I'm not a gigantic cable company.  I apologize for that bit of trickery.  I'm just a lowly baseball fan.  But, since I have your attention...

I don't have cable or satellite television service.   I really don't care to watch anything on cable that I can't get for free (legally) via the internet.   The only thing I watch on a regular basis is baseball.   I have been a loyal MLB.tv subscriber for many years, using the service to watch my local team.  You may recognize me as the guy from Germany who watches Orioles games.  That's right, the Orioles are my local team, but my IP address says I'm from Germany.

I'm' sick of being forced to spoof my IP address just so I can consume your product.  Blacking out local games for loyal fans is a total slap in the face.   Anyone with access to Google can figure out how to defeat this idiotic hurdle.  Why do you force us to play these games?   Do you really care more about cable and satellite companies than your fans?

I have cancelled all my subscriptions with you.  I'm fed up.  I'm not going to pay for access to a German proxy server just so I can be a fan of your product.   Let me know if you ever decide to put fans first and do away with this awful policy.   Until then...

Let me follow up and say that legends like Vin Scully, Eric Nadel or ANY home team announcer has a special place in the hearts of their fans that watch every day.

All that being said - I'm curious as to why different announcers take over during the playoffs. I'm sure Fox (or whoever) would rather bring in one of their famed ""Hollywood"" announcers that call every other sport in addition to baseball. But WHY????

One of the benefits of getting to the playoffs (from a team perspective) is a bigger spotlight for the team, more revenue from the games, merchandise, etc etc etc... After watching my favorite team for the entire season - I have grown extremely fond of the way the home team announcers call games and think that if the team goes to the playoffs, they should bring everything with them along the way. 

Am I just ranting or does it bother anyone else that Fox brings in NFL Football announcers to do playoff BASEBALL because they simply think they are better announcers?

I just read this article, and I have to say I've been feeling this way for a while. There is absolutely no reason why MLB should give these players a break. If MLB is as serious as they say they are about wanting to clean up the game, these players should be an example of it.

I think the deal they made with Ryan Braun is an absolute joke. He was already caught once and was let go because of a technicality. In my opinion, he made a joke of the system. Especially with the way he pleaded his so-called ""innocence."" Now, MLB caught him for a SECOND time. His salary this year is $8.5M. Cut in half for his suspension, he loses out $4.25M. He is due $10M next year. OF COURSE he is going to want a deal that protects that money. This is where MLB should've dropped the hammer on this guy.

I've also read other reports that Bartolo Colon and Melky Cabrera won't be disciplined because they've already faced suspensions. If these two are connected with Biogenesis, and is a new offense, why are they given credit for previous suspensions?

Everything with A-Rod is another complete joke. This guy has made a mockery of the game since day one. His contract from Texas, opting out during the World Series, admitting to steroids and pleading ignorance, the way he acted during the 2012 playoffs, everything about him is fraudulent.

Just a rant to get it off my chest. But I think MLB has definitely taken steps backwards from their ""WE'RE SO SERIOUS ABOUT STEROIDS"" mantra by cutting deals with these players. Cutting deals means there is leniency. Leniency leads to people pushing the envelope to see what they can get away with. If you seriously want to clean up the game, you don't make deals with the cheaters."	t5_2qrrr	True

1349350267.0	10xit6	Been thinking a lot as a Mariner's fan lately.	Fatdap	24	2	8	"I'm pretty well aware that out side of the years with Griffey and before we lost Sweet Lou, we don't have a whole lot going for us. We're like the Browns or Leafs of the MLB.

Was listening to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvNQWQSwmow the other day and just sort of thinking about why I'm a fan of this team year after year even though we never do anything.

That song rings a big bell with me because I grew up in Seattle and used to go to tons of games with my uncle, father, and grandparents. Those are some of the most cherished moments of my entire life. I remember losing my fucking mind one night when I was lucky enough to see Kazuhiro Sasaki play before he went back across seas. The city and stadium loved him. When he walked onto the field, the music turned on, and every fan in the stadium lost their god damn mind.

Thining back on it, I think that's why I love this team so god damn much despite the constant failure. We have some of the most passionate fans I've seen in a sport who genuinely love and appreciate their team.

You see all these teams like the Yankees, who like everyone else, has the passionate fans, then you've got the 70% who watches because it's a winning team, and I think that honest to god I'd rather have the passion than the success. 

We're sort of a laughing stock, and today I realized I don't care. How much our team does for the city and community. I'd like to think that, even though we don't have success, both the franchise and the players we play have always exhibited and displayed a lot of class, with the exception of A-Rod selling out for a bigger paycheck.

I'll never feel more excitement, or heartbreak, than the season we had in 2001 when we tied a record. The first landmark we had in years, and came so god damn close, but couldn't do it. That was the worst feeling in the fucking world for me, but god damn I was proud to see us go that far.

We might not have a Series, or even a Pennant, but I still love the shit out of this team.

Nobody has to read this, it doesn't matter if I get flamed or whatever, just feels good to write it and put it up somewhere."	t5_2qrrr	True

Game is tied and in the 11th inning. The home team (Giants) have runners at 1st and 3rd with one out. The Marlins decide to intentionally walk the next batter to load the bases. 

The broadcaster said this would allow the middle infielders to play at double-play depth instead of playing in. Why would they have had to play in before the intentional walk?

If available, we watch the game on delay and fast forward through commercial breaks thanks to DVR. I hate commercials. I'm not alone.

Last year at a St. Louis Cardianls baseball game, they ran an advertisement in between innings in which there was television static noise and the sound of a plug getting pulled. Then, for a brief moment, all the jumbotrons, scoreboards, signs, and sounds were shut off. Whoa. Effective. All I could hear was idle chit-chat and calls from the Beer Man.

And then, as the jumbotrons, screens, and Coca-Cola signs came back to life, a voiceover came on the PA talking about the local power company. Whew. Back in America. But all I could think about was those 10 seconds of commercial silence.

What if a stadium could ""go dark"" for an entire baseball game? No thumping music in between innings, trivia games brought to you by Clarkson Eyecare, Attendance quizzes thanks to Subway, Calls to the bullpen brought to you by AT&amp;T, etc. All you get is all you need: a working PA for player and game announcements, a scoreboard, and only the sights and sounds of baseball. 

One game a year. Make it a special theme or promotion day that allows people to experience the way baseball used to look and sound. Sure the fabricated energy of walk-up music and between-innings trivia and games would be gone, but a different vibe would take its place and I think enough people would be interested in experiencing that.

Now clearly there are things that the sponsors won't like about this. The idea is simple but I don't know if it is at all possible because I don't know the intricacies of sponsorship contracts. But perhaps there is a way for the team to notify the companies that sponsor the games that there will be one game a year that will have virtually zero advertisements for their product. 

Who knows? No I'm actually asking who knows? What are your thoughts on the plausibility and potential popularity of this idea? (all those P's were accidental....purely)

With opening day just over two weeks away it’s time to take a closer look at what we can expect in baseball’s six divisions for the 2013 regular season.

The years of the Phillies dominance came to a screeching halt in 2012 with the emergence of the Nationals and the ever steady play of the Braves. The NL East is profiling as a two team dog fight up top, with the easy dismissal of the Mets and Marlins as nothing more than cannon fodder, and the Phillies desperately trying to stay in the hunt. Here is the rundown on the NL East.

**Projected Standings:**

1. Washington Nationals

2. Atlanta Braves

3. Philadelphia Phillies

4. New York Mets

5. Miami Marlins


**Washington Nationals:**


Notable Losses: Mike Morse

Notable Additions: Rafael Soriano, Denard Span, Dan Haren

It was a tough decision between the Nationals and Braves but eventually I settled on the defending 2012 NL East champions. The Nationals had an extremely strong offseason. With starting center fielders at a premium, the Nationals managed to secure Denard Span who is shaping up to be the team’s new leadoff hitter. The Nationals added veteran Dan Haren to a lights out rotation, who in 2012 led the NL in opponent BA. Following that up, they locked up the 9th inning shutdown man, Rafael Soriano. With Davey Johnson in his second full year at the helm, and Stephen Strasburg with his innings limit lifted, I expect nothing short of a repeat NL East title for the Nationals in 2013.

*Keys to Success:*

*Consistency – 2012 Silver Slugger award winners Ian Desmond and Adam LaRoche need to maintain their stellar play. Combine that with Bryce Harper avoiding the dreaded sophomore slump and Ryan Zimmerman’s consistency and we see the backbone of the Nat’s offense.

*Keep it simple – With a bullpen consisting of Clippard, Storen and Soriano, Nationals SP’s need only focus on working 6 innings and let the pen do the rest.


**Atlanta Braves:**


Notable Losses: Chipper Jones, Michael Bourn, Martin Prado, David Ross, Tommy Hanson

Notable Additions: Justin Upton, B.J. Upton, Jordan Walden, Gerald Laird

Always the bridesmaid never the bride, it’s now been seven seasons since the braves won the NL East, including an active streak of three straight second place finishes. The losses of Chipper Jones and David Ross may be slightly brushed over from a production standpoint; however, the two played a vital leadership role in a relatively young locker room. The Braves will undoubtedly miss their presence. The departure of Michael Bourn might be slightly missed atop the lineup as Andrelton Simmons slots in as the new lead-off hitter. In replacing Bourn’s outfield play the Braves added the Upton brothers B.J. and Justin, who will join Jason Heyward in an outfield that will probably be second to none in the entire league. Not to mention the addition of Jordan Walden, making this the best or second best bullpen in the majors. Having such a shutdown pen is going to allow the Braves to keep their pitchers fresh and ready for a push towards the series.

*Keys to Success:*

*Get the ball in play - The Braves struck out a staggering 1289 times at the dish in 2012 and added the Upton brothers who had a combined 290 KO’s. I see a lot of bases-loaded-nobody-out innings ended by three straight whiffs.

*Continued Pitching Development – Teheran, Minor, Beachy and Medlen are 22, 25, 26 and 27 years old. If they can continue on the dominate path they set themselves on in 2012, the Braves can contend for years to come.


**Philadelphia Phillies:**


Notable Losses: Vance Worley, Josh Linblom

Notable Additions: Ben Revere, Delmon Young, Michael Young, Mike Adams

After five straight NL East titles including a 2008 World Series win, the Phillies aging lineup finally caught up to them. The Phillies finished third in the NL East in 2012, compiling an 81-81 record resulting in their worst finish since 2003. Chase Utley’s shaky knees and Ryan Howard’s degenerating body have left the middle of the Phillies lineup looking a lot more vulnerable than the days of old. Adding Delmon and Michael Young may add some experience and security to the Phillie’s order. However, Delmon Young is nowhere near the prospect he was hyped to be and Michael Young is on the wrong side of 35—nevermind 30! The departure of Vance Worley leaves a much bigger hole in the rotation than most viewers are aware of. He is departing from a staff that led all of the majors in K/BB ratio at 3.39, and the three aces—Halladay, Lee and Hamels—may not be enough to keep the team competitive.

*Keys to Success:*

*Return of the Doctor – Roy Halladay had his worst ERA (4.49) and Win (11) totals last season since 2004. The Phillies will need Doc to be the surgeon of the past if they hope to compete.

*Lineup Health – Chase Utley hasn’t played more than 115 games since 2009, and Ryan Howard only managed to play in 71 last year. The Phillies need full seasons from both or will be relying on the likes of Freddy Galvis and Darin Ruf to lead the charge.


**New York Mets:**


Notable Losses: R.A. Dickey, Josh Thole, Andres Torres.

Notable Additions: Shaun Marcum, Travis d’Arnaud, John Buck

The Mets have a string of four consecutive 4th place finishes in the NL East, and the near future doesn’t look any brighter for the New York underdog. This offseason the Mets shipped away reigning NL CY Young winner R.A. Dickey to the Toronto Blue Jays for top catching prospect Travis d’Arnaud and pitching prospect Noah Syndergaard. With three prospects in the MLB top 30 the Mets have their eyes set on the future. They also locked up current face of the franchise David Wright to an eight year $138 million deal. It will be a couple years before future rotation studs Matt Harvey and Zack Wheeler are ready to be 200 inning guys. The Mets are destined for yet another losing season.

*Keys to Success:*

*Outfield Contributions – With a starting three containing the likes of Lucas Duda, Marlon Byrd, Colin Cowgill, Jordany Valdespin or Kirk Nuewenhuis, the Mets are going to depend on some offensive production from this grab bag of outfielders.

*Stay the course – The Mets need to continue to let Wheeler, Harvey and d’Arnaud blossom into the upper end talent they can be to provide for the teams future.

**Miami Marlins:**

Notable Losses: Jose Reyes, Josh Johnson, Mark Buehrle, Emilio Bonifacio,

Notable Additions: Placido Polanco, Juan Pierre, Jake Marisnick, Justin Nicolino

It’s hard to imagine an ownership group alienating a fan base such as Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria has in Miami. After using public money to help fund the new stadium and promising to field a winning team, the 2012 Miami Marlins were nothing short of a disaster. How does Loria respond? He proceeds to manufacture an all-out fire sale of the team’s top assets apart from Giancarlo Stanton. The team’s fate is understandably doomed comparing the notable losses and additions list; they gave up three all-stars in the mega deal with the Blue Jays in return for a bundle of prospects. The Marlins have no foreseeable success in the NL East.

*Keys to Success:*

*One man wrecking crew – How far can Stanton carry this team?

*Play the park – With the new Marlins stadium profiling as a pitchers park the Marlins only hope is to try and limit opponents’ home runs and small ball their way to a few wins.
