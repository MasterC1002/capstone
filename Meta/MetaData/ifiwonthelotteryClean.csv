For a long time I've thought that my wife and I would buy an RV and travel the country with our dogs until we found a place that felt like home where we could settle down. This still holds a lot of appeal for me, but when I really gave it some thought I realized the thing my heart desires. Even if we took some time to travel, I don't think anything would pull me in another direction.

I want an apartment in Manhatten and I want to pursue a career in stand up comedy and acting. I've done stand up comedy but I live in a fairly rural area so there isn't much opportunity to practice in front of an audience. Living in NY it's possible to get on stage several times a week. With financial freedom, I could see myself doing just that. 

My definition of success or wealth has never been measured in dollars. It is control over my time. Financial wealth gives you freedom and independence to do the thing you want to do. For me, that's more appealing than any new toys I might be able to buy.

But for sure I'd get a Segway too."	t5_2vgya	True

I'd rush them out the door and into their car, and we would set off for parts unknown.  

I don't know how long I could keep this up, but I would like to get friends at staged locations that could help further the lie, and then finally we would all end up at their new house, with their new cars, and the new freedom that they would have not having to work another day in their lives.

Basically, I would buy a really nice camera, and begin by going out on the streets of my city and stopping random people with my camera. The first people that would stop and talk and hang out with me, I'd ask them what they would buy right now if they could and why. I'd get them real excited about it and what not then surprise them by buying it for them, all on camera. I think it would be a really fun way to make a cool little youtube series. I feel like eventually it would get popular and people would send in requests, so I could travel to people who had the best stories and most unique requests and surprise them and film a youtube series of sorts where I spend my money to make a select group of people happy.

I would also do the following:

* Pay off my debts

* Invest a good chunk

* Build my friend a library to run (he's a library science major)

* Buy the theater I used to work at

* Buy my parents their dream house

* Marry my gf and buy our dream house

* Fund the 24 movie (this is a really selfish one, but damn I loved that show)

* Buy a new car, not necessarily some crazy nice one

Is there a list of things people should prepare for like setting up accounts, meet with Accountant, etc?	texastobaben	55	22	23	"I play the lottery whenever it get over $100MIL... you know, when it's worth it. What are the things you SHOULD do so that you don't blow it all, get killed, minimize your exposure, etc.. I have a CPA in the family that would probably be my 1st or 2nd call.

After that, besides the fun stuff, what other *""boring""* things would you do? 

-I'd give $1MIL to each person in my immediate family

-$200,000 college funds for each of my nieces plus an extra $1MIL in a savings account for future niece/nephew or personal children

-pay off personal debt

-probably set $10MIL aside in a savings account only being able to take like $100,000/month

Those buildings are big enough to include a small bistro or saloon so people could have dinner and a show in the same building.

I'd show old Kaiju movies, Star Wars marathons, Peter Sellers films, Chaplin, Hitchcock, Kurosawa and Kubrick. I could finally see Metropolis , Casablanca, Lawrence of Arabia and, yes, Big Trouble in Little China as they were supposed to be seen. I'd play Doctor Who, Game of Thrones and Sherlock on the big screen as they came out if they'd let me.

Admission would be just enough to cover operating costs and popcorn would be sold as cheap as it actually is. Anyone showing up in formal wear gets free admission and first dibs on box seating, cos a little god-damn class never hurt anybody.
