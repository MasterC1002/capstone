The following are the key points I remember:

* This is certainly the most tech-savy generation yet coming out of college (this is the four-to-five year period where gadgets have advanced the most start at 16 to 18 years of age).

Unfortunatlely, this has led to the following problems during interviews:

* Lack of experience in a professional office environment

* Failure to make eye-contact

* Using fill-in works like ""uh-huh"" and ""yea"" 

(needless to say this is unprofessional)

* They tend to have a sense of ""entitlement""

""I put in my dues, got my degree, now where's this great job I'm entitled to?""

My advice:

A little bit of professionalism, maturity, and respect goes a long way.  Also, leave your arrogance at the door."	t5_2r91p	True

The basic use of this subreddit ought to be obvious: Use it as a place to post links to interesting interviews with nearly anyone.  If you're posting a link to an interview in some other subreddit, feel free to cross-post it here as well.  From time to time I also see Redditors solicit suggestions for questions they can ask people they have the opportunity to interview, and those Redditors who are lucky enough to conduct such interviews are welcome to use this space to crowd-source questions.

Most interviews center on topics that are relevant to more topic-oriented subreddits, so the focus in /r/interview will probably be mostly on the art of interview.  A well-conducted interview draws the interviewee out, and illuminates the subject by getting them to talk candidly or extemporaneously.  The best kind of interviews are those that result in statements, exclamations or expressions that likely wouldn't have been made in a more controlled form of communication, and if you come across any like that, be sure to link to them here.
