Got her at Astor Place, 5 years ago. She's survived so many falls, it's unbelievable. First piece i ever bought, yet never actually gave her an official name. I love making up new names for her on the spot when people ask what her name is.

Tips: as far as chinese glass spoons go, inside out glass is usually the strongest. i recommend a 4 inch bowl. anything shorter and you'll burn your eyebrows off. anything longer and it will look like a dildo and be harder to keep in your pocket.

inside out glass is pretty easy to spot, it's mostly clear and looks as if it was decorated then flipped inside out, leaving the design ""inside"" the bowl, and the outside clear."	t5_2qxgx	True
