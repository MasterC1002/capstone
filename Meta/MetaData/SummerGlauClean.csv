So I am in Seattle right now for the Emerald City Comicon. I just met Summer. It was amazing. Picture etc. to follow.

So.. TWO IMPORTANT THINGS

1. I asked her about the fanmail.  She isn't sure if she will ever get the letters you sent to the Schiff company, so send new ones to her new address:

 Summer Glau

 3940 laurel canyon blvd.

 #857

 Studio City, CA 91604

 USA

She said she is really excited about this because she is in control of this fanmail box rather than an intermediary. 

2. Because I love all of you (And we hit 2000 subs), I now have in my possession a *SIGNED* photo of Summer to give away. I will mail it worldwide. Once I figure out how I am going to do this I will make another post.

3. If you have any questions, lemme know. I'm still reeling a little bit. She was super awesome."	t5_2rrmj	True

The other moderators and myself have been working pretty hard  as of late at making this a reputable place to come for new news and pictures of Summer. We have been really happy at how the community has grown, and until now, have not had to do any real policing apart from taking down the occasional double post. 

However, just over twenty four hours ago a user posted a fake nude photo of Summer that caused a bit of a stir among the readers of this subreddit and the mods themselves. We feel that such photos do not have a place here, and from here on out are going to be removing any fake pictures that are posted to the subreddit. We feel that this reddit and it's users are of a higher calibre and that spreading fake photos of Summer is disrespectful.

Just so we are clear:**NO FAKES WILL BE PERMITTED IN THIS SUBREDDIT**.

If you really have a hankering for looking at poorly shoop'd nudes, it really only takes twenty seconds to google for it. [There is even a subreddit for fakes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/CelebFakes/)

If Summer ever decides to get her kit off for a film, or do a photoshoot for Hef, and she signs off on it, then by all means, post it. 

Until then: **NO FAKES PLEASE**

Feel free to bring forwards any questions, concerns, comments, rants or belittling of heavy handed nazi-style moderating.

Thank you for all the entertainment and joy you have given us Summer! Everyone here at the SummerGlau subreddit wishes you a happy birthday, you really deserve it! :)

To celebrate Summer's birthday, we just updated the design on our subreddit. Feel free to leave feedback about it. We plan to rotate the header image and color scheme occasionally, so if you want to send in an image feel free to do so by [messaging us here](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23SummerGlau). It should be 1920x260 ideally, and we would prefer to receive it as a png. "	t5_2rrmj	True

I’d be warming up and doing my stuff, cool down and leave, and she’s in the corner fighting nine guys. And she had to start months before us. She worked really hard .""

Lots of actors would emphasize on how hard they worked but Nathan preferred to highlight Summer's hard training. Very classy and touching!

'Inside the Box' is more than a short film, it serves as a small taste of David Martin-Porras’s reach and talent, as he will also direct “A Texas Story,” a feature-length film that will take-on HIV criminalization, as do the short.

 The short was financed by crowd funding but you can still support it by spreading the word about it or by doing donations to help them rise the funds they need for the post-productions costs and more.

Learn more at : [Help 'Inside the Box' raising funds](http://summerglauwiki.com/news/help_inside_the_box_raising_funds/2012-11-11-379)

&gt;""HELP FOR THE HOLIDAYS""
Hallmark Channel Original Movie World Premiere
Sunday, December 9 (8p.m. ET/PT, 7C)
Starring: Summer Glau, Eva La Rue, Dan Gauthier, John Brotherton
Although she loves Christmas, Santa's elf Christine (Glau) wonders if there could be more to life than making toys in the North Pole. When Santa receives an emergency wish from a little boy in Los Angeles, he puts Christine on special assignment, sending her to L.A. to give the VanCamp family - mom Sara (La Rue), dad Scott (Gauthier), and their two kids - a holiday wake-up call.

Be careful the premiere date announced previously at IMDb has been changed to December 9, which means less time to wait before we see Summer as an elf :-)"	t5_2rrmj	True

&gt;Shawn Gray

&gt;Summer Glau has joined us over Skype. She mostly repeated her apology for not coming and blamed her lost passport on catburglars.
 

&gt;Louise Foley

&gt;Summer apologised for cancelling and said she'd see us in Montreal in september. She sent a video apology.
 

&gt;WilliamTheB

&gt;Just got back from the con! What happened was that Summer had been planning to attend the Firefly panel with Jewel and Nathan early in the day. Obviously she couldn't -- but she skyped partway through the panel and talked via audio for a few minutes. She attributed her passport's disappearance to a cat burglar. ""I have to get a new one,"" she added, and then Nathan and Jewel said, with ""duh"" voices, ""Yeah, you do."" The tone was delightful and light and pleasant, and it ended with Nathan saying ""Suuummmmeeer!"" in the style of the blooper real ""Summer!"" exclamation, and Summer seeming to be just the right annoyed/embarrassed/pleased mixture.

&gt;Fans of Summer Glau (Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Firefly) and Syfy’s high-octane hit-series ALPHAS will get a double dose of the actress as she returns as Alpha Skylar Adams in the final two episodes of the season beginning this Monday, October 15 at 8PM ET/PT. The thrilling and shocking second season finale of Alphas airs Monday, October 22nd at 8PM ET/PT.

&gt;[spoiler ep 2.12](#s ""In the season’s penultimate episode, “Need to Know”, Dr. Rosen (David Strathairn) kidnaps and interrogates an Alpha prisoner forcing the team to wonder how far Rosen will go to avenge the death of his daughter Dani. Meanwhile, Harken (Malik Yoba) and Gary (Ryan Cartwright), desperately search for Skylar Adams (Glau), only to discover that Stanton Parish (recurring guest star John Pyper-Ferguson) has imprisoned her in a twisted form of captivity."")

&gt;[spoiler ep 2.13](#s ""In the Season 2 finale, “God’s Eye”, separated from his team and haunted by vivid hallucinations of his daughter, Dani (guest star Kathleen Munroe), an increasingly desperate Dr. Rosen seeks a final confrontation with malevolent Alpha leader Stanton Parish. Meanwhile, his team of Alphas, with Skylar’s help, battles both the clock and their issues of mutual distrust to try and thwart Parish’s deadly plans."")

This is an appeal for a general mobilization to watch Alphas next Monday at 8pm on Syfy and make the finals episodes the most watched of the season. Spread the word!

Convince all your friends who have a Nielsen Box to watch Alphas next Mondays and season 3 is a go ;-)"	t5_2rrmj	True

1348524194.0	10ey7i	/r/SummerGlau New Rules Discussion	KortoloB	21	4	31	"Howdy everyone!

We, the moderators, are in the process of improving our sidebar, and we have therefore proposed some small changes to how the rules are presented. In an effort to make this reddit more transparent and to get outside opinions, we have decided to create a modpost for discussion surrounding the rules.

To start with, these are our current rules:

&gt;1. **No fakes**. NSFW is fine if it's authentic content and has Summer's consent (i.e. absolutely no paparazzi nudity or photoshopped nudity, but screen captures from shows/films are okay)
&gt;1. **No rude comments**. This includes comments about Glau getting shows cancelled, [here's why](http://www.reddit.com/r/SummerGlau/comments/ixgph/summer_glau_guest_star_on_alphas_confirmed/c27h0r9).
&gt;1. **No blogspam**. If the majority of your submissions lead to the same site and you have a personal interest in getting that site visitors, you're blogspamming. You should submit content for content's sake, not for promoting another site.
&gt;1. **Use your common sense**. If you're unsure if your content/comment is suitable, [please don't hesitate to ask us here.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSummerGlau)

&gt;First time offenders can expect a warning, but repeated offenses or blatant and excessive rule violations will result in a ban.

These are the proposed new rules, they're mostly just shortened versions of the originals:

&gt;1. **No fakes**. Mature content is fine if it's authentic and has Summer's consent (i.e. no faked or paparazzi nudity)
&gt;1. **No rude comments**. This includes blaming Summer for cancellations, [here's why](http://www.reddit.com/r/SummerGlau/comments/ixgph/summer_glau_guest_star_on_alphas_confirmed/c27h0r9).
&gt;1. **No blogspam**. Submit content for content's sake, not for ad revenue. *Original* content is exempt from this rule.

&gt;Unless your rule violation is extreme, we will only warn you for transgressions. [Contact us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSummerGlau) if you have any questions or want to discuss a wrongful ban.

Shortening the rules will first of all make them quicker to read, hopefully easier to comprehend and reduce the wall of text that is our sidebar.

Even if we've only focused on reducing the length of the rules, we're not just looking for critique on how they're phrased. Please tell us if you want a new rule added, an old one removed or a change in some other way.

Some topics that could be discussed:

* Paparazzi images: Should they continue to be allowed or are they a violation of Summer's privacy?

* Cancellation jokes *(rule #2)*: How disrespectful are they? Does the offense justify removal? Should people be allowed to put blame on Summer, even if it's a joke?

* Blogspam *(rule #3)*: Is it okay if people earn money through ads just for gathering images from other sources on the web and putting them on their own website?  
How do we determine if something is original content that the owner should be allowed to earn money from?

**TL;DR** New rules are shorter versions of the old ones. What would you guys like changed/added/removed?"	t5_2rrmj	True

Gaminic	22	6	63	"So, a few weeks back I watched Firefly and loved it, only to have my heart broken after hearing it was cancelled after a single season. Out of ideas and out of series, I decided to start watching Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. I had heard bad things about it, but it has Summer Glau, so in the worst case scenario it's still enjoyable with the sound muted. And I loved it. Definitely not the best series I've ever seen, but very enjoyable. And then I hit the finale of season 2 only to reach the next depression.

So, now what? Can anyone suggest a follow up series? Not necessarily with miss Glau involved (but it's a plus), not necessarily sci-fy, but anything I can give my heart to for at least a few weeks."	t5_2rrmj	True

If you guys feel up to it, consider discussing things other than just Summer. *Gasp*. I know, it's what we are all here for, but I think it might be more enjoyable if we focus on all aspects of the show. Just a suggestion.

A slightly cheesy idea, I do agree, but one that might have some merit. So on August 27th, if we all tweeted a tag, we might be able to trend Summer on twitter, even if it is only for an hour.

My ideas for tags include cheesy lines like #ThankGlauItsSummerOnSyFy, or something simple like #SummerOnAlphas.

1335569065.0	sw22x	Thoughts about the content of r/SummerGlau/	alexandremcfly	22	5	21	"I read recently a post on a comics subreddit where the moderator was thinking about the trend of the content in it : less and less comments and discussions about the comics or the authors and more and more pictures posted without context.
He explained that the ""pictures only"" posts were highly upvoted and were almost systematically in the top 25 of the subreddit, leaving less room for the other posts (i'm not an expert on the mechanics behind this).

I think the same remarks can be made about the r/SummerGlau/; don't misunderstand me, i'm not ranting but making constructive observations. As a user (by reading, commenting and posting) of the reddit, i think i have the right to give my opinion. This post will probably interest the mods firstly but anyone is invited to participate to the reflection, unless the mods decide this topic should not be discussed publicly , which i would perfectly understand.

I can speak only for myself : i know from my experience in another fansite that people prefer simply looking at pictures instead of engaging in long discussions and analyses. But it doesn't prevent me and a few other from offering a large range of topics because i think variety is more interesting than an all-picture site. I post a lot of links to pictures here, but you'll notice that each time my posts are connected to Summer's current events or ask a question (which pic do you prefer,...), because i think it's a way to engage with members of the reddit instead of simply waiting the upvotes for a nice (preferably sexy) pic of Summer; the latest posts are welcome of course but i think a balance should be respected.

A good example is the succesfull post i made at r/Firefly (inspired by a comment made here) which generated 707 upvotes and 55 comments (KortoloB smartly took that opportunity to advertise this reddit btw).

And now let the bashing begin!

Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles is my favorite tv show and where i saw Summer Glau for the first time and then wanted to know more of her work. Because of this show, i started to get involved in online discussion forums and eventually participated in the great adventure of developping a fansite. Beyond the way everyone first become a fan of Summer or our personal journey, our appreciation of Summer Glau is the reason why we gather with fans from all over the world in various fansites. 
 
Summer Glau has been in Hollywood for more than 10 years now and while she has yet many roles awaiting for her, i thought it would be a great Christmas gift to devote attention to her professional career. 
 
To confirm our love of Summer Glau, and to explain all the reasons you should love her too (if you don’t already), we invite members of the fandom to compil with us a list, A-Z, of Summer’s awesome qualities and contributions to the world. The list will contain (almost) everything you need to know about this great TV and Movie actress, and it’s worth a read just to see how we tackled the more difficult letters without cheating at all. 
 
While another SG fan and i have started to list the topics that should be included on the list, we need your help to fill in the blanks or to add more suggestions to existing ones. Once we have selected together the topics for each letter, we will ask fans to volunteer to write the commentary for each topic.

I think redditors could participate to this project by providing suggestions and why not volunteer to write a commentary.

Important : You don't have to be a member of the Summer Glau Wiki in order to participate btw, you can leave your suggestions here and i will pass them on..
 
You can read the existing suggestions at : (http://summerglauwiki.com/forum/4-495-1)

I think we should not apply this rule; this is not mandatory anyway, each subreddit is free to adopt its own rules as we discussed  previously together.

Some websites have a similar ""No Thanks"" policy and it's fine for sites/reddits who have a lot of submissions and lots of commenters (like the /Firefly subreddit for example). But this is not the case here; there are days when no link is submitted and no comment is added. Adding comments is a way to make this reddit alive and encourage more people to post and comment.

As a member who submit content regularly, i'm glad when someone takes the time to upvote me (preferably) or better, add a comment; a simple ""thank you"" is also very appreciated. If someone wants to add a more elaborate answer, that's fine too :-)

But this reddit is not just a news site, it's first and foremost a fan site; we don't want to report the news and then go back to a normal activity. We want to bring Summer's work under the spotlight and let more fans share with us this strong feeling that Summer Glau is one of the best actresses in Hollywood.

Helping to spread the word about tonights episode is within everyone's reach; just make a tweet or report it on your Facebook page. Mention it at Lunch break or during your work (what is a Day at work compared to the pleasure of having Summer Glau on tv)

The Summer Glau Wiki reported an early review by a journalist who has seen a screener of the episode :

&gt;Genre fans love Summer Glau. From her role as the enigmatic River in Firefly to the cold, but somehow compassionate Cameron in Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. But this Monday, August 22, we get to see her in one of her most exciting roles to date.

&gt;Summer appears as a rogue Alpha with a knack for making stuff out of anything at hand. A sort of super-MacGyver. But her stuff is much cooler than Richard Dean Anderson could ever imagine. And she has a past with Doctor Rosen’s team. Now she’s on the run, and it’s up to our team of Alpha heroes to bring her in.

&gt;Fans of Summer Glau will find this role, I believe, quite enjoyable. She’s not mentally unbalanced, coldly emotionless, one-dimensionally kick-ass, or even a psychotic genius this time. She’s just a brilliant and gifted woman on a mission. This episode is a roller-coaster ride from the start, so strap in and enjoy.

Tonight's episode will be terrific and Summer Glau will make a great performance."	t5_2rrmj	True

(http://www.tv.com/warehouse-13-looking-good-for-renewal/story/26410.html)

&gt;Summer Glau Summer Glau Summer Glau! The World Record holder for most nerdy stalkers will guest star on Syfy's Alphas, playing an Alpha with the superpower of getting shows canceled.

A fan of Summer wrote an answer in the comment section :

&gt;I'm deeply hurt by what you wrote about Summer Glau and her fans and i hope i'm not the only one. I'm a huge fan of Summer Glau but that doesn't mean automatically i'm a stalker or a nerd or both, unlike what you're implying in your article.

&gt;Summer Glau has played two of the most iconic characters in scifi history but i doubt these characters would have had this impact without Summer Glau's subtile and inspired performances.

&gt;Summer Glau carries herself with dignity, and appreciates her fans as much as they appreciate her as a result.She is so talented, driven, and engaged that she excels almost immediately in any part she plays. She is as beautiful on the inside as she is on the outside and she has a raw and pure talent that allows her to breathe vivacious life into her characters.

&gt;Scifi shows have a tendency to get cancelled on broacast tv these days and Summer Glau is typecast, this is true; i don't recall Miss Glau played on The Event, No Ordinary Family, V or Flasforward though.

&gt;I can understand some internet users want to sound funny by mentioning the so-called Summer Glau curse but this is inadmissible when it comes from someone who claims to be a journalist and write in such a famous website. Not to mention this is insulting for her fans and for herself.

&gt;And don't tell me that i have no sense of humour, or that it was not meant to be taken seriously or that you're a great fan of hers as they say each time. That doesn't remove one inch of the feeling to have been insulted.

In the last scene of the last episode in S2, you see Derek talking to John. He says something like ""You're gonna be famous today, because my brother is back and that's his jacket.""

Then the camera goes to Kyle and Cameron. You see Cameron lean down and pat a dog. She is simply stunning, and seems to be really happy.

This is what got me. I realised that it wasn't actually Cameron. It was Allison Young. The appearance and identity that Cameron stole. I know this because Cameron almost never smiles, she can't feel happy. Also, throughout the series and even in the movies, dogs go crazy whenever there is a terminator nearby. But this dog seemed calm when Allison was patting it.

It's build as a procedural with serialized elements but the serialized part is not heavy and co-creator Zak Penn said the basics would be revealed in the upcoming episodes. They wanted a character driven serie. Though i think there is a fair amount of action so far. It's easy to dive in Alphas.

&gt;“We sort of have two [primary arcs] this year,” Berlanti said of the big villains driving the action. “In a way, we sort of had two last year as well, if you think about Malcolm and Merlyn [AKA The Dark Archer] in terms of who he was on each side of that divide. We have a similar but different thing that we do this year.”  

&gt;[...]  

&gt;Kreisberg spoke to the overall plans of the opening episodes, saying, “Isabel Rochev is played by Summer Glau. She’s a Green Arrow supporting character, but we also have a very well known villain from the DCU coming along in Episode 2 and then a not so well known villain coming in Episode 3.  

&gt;[...]  

&gt;Summer is so amazing and talented, and we've been fans of hers for years,” the producer continued. “It's amazing to see her in dailies telling Oliver Queen off. That’s a lot of fun.

I'm sure a lot of Summer Glau fans are not watching GA (regularly) at all but personally i will watch this episode, mostly because i'm deeply involved in a fansite but also because i don't want to miss the opportunity to see Summer on tv which is kinda rare recently.

Though if we take a look at the synopsys and sneak peeks from the episode, i'm not sure Summer Glau will have lot of screentime; one can watch them in order to have a better understanding of the stories going on :

I stand in line for about an hour and a half waiting for the picture I've always wanted, with Summer Glau. The first time we go they make us leave and come back. When we get back an hour later, the line loops around about 3 booths. We get in line thinking it will be quick like every other booth signing and picture. Instead we only moved about half a snake line. She leaves for some other thing, and we are all stuck standing there. Took the people about an hour to realize that we are all tired of waiting so they give us all numbers, me being 79. So we walk away and come back at her the next time. We were like ""Ok. We will get it this time."" But no. We are in the line again for another 1-2 hours waiting. Barely move once again. Most of us tired by now. She had to leave again due to some other thing. I had to leave to catch the train and head home after that. So I didn't get to spend much time at the booths. Not everyone got to get their signing or picture. It's nice to know she wants to spend a few minutes with everyone, but there were so many people. Maybe next time spend a little less time so everyone can get there and get what they asked. As much as I'd love to spend hours with her, I'd give it up so everyone could get what they paid for. We are now waiting for our refund, which should be here in a few days."	t5_2rrmj	True

I don't want to encourage anyone to spam, but if you see a somewhat popular post regarding Summer anywhere, feel free tell people about this place. If they like Summer they're bound to want to know, and you're doing everyone a favor.

Another tip to help grow our community: try to submit Summer-stuff here first, then x-post it to bigger subreddits. That way people learn about this place.

Alphas's writers have created a great character in season 1 episode 7 'Catch and Release'; Summer Glau brought life to Skylar in a stunning performance as usual, leaving the audience wanting for more; given the ending of the episode and the good reviews, i'm sure the creators of the show are seriously thinking to bring her back in future episodes.

Meanwhile, Summer Glau fans have already started to write fancfictions featuring Skylar. This story is only the first part of a work in progress called 'Alphas: Dragonfly'; let's encourage the writer to continue.
