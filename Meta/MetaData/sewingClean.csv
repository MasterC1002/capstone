1372817514.0	1hjgdi	None of my friends understand why I can't sleep at night...	LewEllen	126	12	44	"I've been sewing since I was a kid, not quite before electricity, but new machines still had cams when I started. Sewing was not considered a cool hobby, and still isn't by many folks my age. They've always admired what I've made but many have commented, ""I don't know anyone could sit behind a sewing machine.""

I sew garments, quilts, home dec, and in the last few years I've fallen in love with machine embroidery and digitizing my own designs. I've been through a lot of machines through the years, some of them great, and some not so good. I've always had to settle and have never been able to buy quite the machine I wanted. 

I left my ""real job"" a couple of years ago and have been able to build up enough sewing and embroidery business to justify investing in a nice new machine. I did all the research, drove hundreds of miles to test drive machines, and finally found the one I wanted, at a price I could afford.

I ordered a Brother DreamWeaver XE (combo sewing embroidery) last week, and it should be at my dealer's Friday. I'm just damn near giddy and can barely sleep.

Nobody I know IRL gets how big a thing this is for me. I've wanted a machine like this for years. It's something I'll use every day for work and for fun. Anyway, I thought you guys might get it.

1365657381.0	1c49c6	Finished a... I guess it's a Cat Fish Skirt.	fairyrebel	126	13	17	"Just wanted to share a [special sewing project](http://imgur.com/a/yJSG7#5m6x1N1) I finished recently, and maybe get some ideas from the crowd about what other skirt-tails I can make for my friend CeeCee.

CeeCee is a cool kitty. She is special. She was born deformed and has no use of her back legs or tail.  Even without normal use of her rear legs, she still gets around pretty well. She lives with a coworker of mine (I work at a veterinary hospital) who takes amazing care of her and has been her best friend for quite a few years now.

CeeCee has to wear diapers. My coworker had the idea that it might be nice for her to not drag her diaper/legs around directly on the floor (causes friction sores) and started using halves of old pillow cases to make her sack tails. I thought she deserved something much cooler than an old pillow case and came up with [this padded fish tail skirt](http://imgur.com/a/yJSG7#5m6x1N1) for her to wear over her diaper, legs, and tail.

She is super sweet and not at all as crazy feisty as she appears in that first picture of her. :) She only busts out the 'tude on special occasions."	t5_2sczp	True

Patterns were $1.99 and I bought a whole passel of them (Vogue [8807](http://voguepatterns.mccall.com/filebin/images/product_images/Add_3_Full/V8807.jpg), [8146](http://images.patternreview.com/sewing/patterns/vogue/8146/8146.jpg), [7881](http://pk.b5z.net/i/u/2174754/i/june/7881vg043_i2.jpg), [2787](http://patternvault.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/beyondvintage-octnov2011a.jpg), [2532](http://voguepatterns.mccall.com/filebin/images/product_images/Full/V2532.jpg), [2401](http://img0.etsystatic.com/003/0/5143912/il_fullxfull.368900724_sw1q.jpg), [1233](http://www.handmadebycarla.com/images/v1233.jpg), [1235](http://voguepatterns.mccall.com/filebin/images/product_images/Full/V1235.jpg), [1223](http://www.handmadebycarla.com/images/v1223.jpg), [1051](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_FXPe4fTZn-Q/Srg_IDi3saI/AAAAAAAAByQ/qbM-1Imiw-o/s400/V1051.jpg), Butterick [5711](http://butterick.mccall.com/filebin/images/product_images/Full/B5711.jpg), Simplicity [3921](http://images.patternreview.com/sewing/patterns/simplicity/3921/3921.jpg), [2621](http://images.patternreview.com/sewing/patterns/simplicity/2621/2621.jpg), [1818](http://images.patternreview.com/sewing/patterns/simplicity/1818/1818.jpg), [1777](http://images.patternreview.com/sewing/patterns/simplicity/1777/1777.jpg), McCall's [6139](http://mccallpattern.mccall.com/filebin/images/product_images/Full/M6139.jpg), [4698](https://sites.google.com/site/excluzivecrafts/sewing-patterns/mccalls/M4698.jpg)). 

Half of the patterns are for clothes for me and half are costume patterns that I like to keep around just in case. Costume patterns are pretty pricey, so I figured it made sense to pick a few I might use up if they were that cheap. As you can see, I splurged on a ton of $$ Vogue patterns as well. I also got nine bolts of fabric (2 liners, 1 navy blue bottomweight suiting, 1 geometric printed brown chiffon, 1 dark blue organza, 1 shitty maroon satin, 1 [cotton print](http://www.joann.com/april-johnston-project-runway-fabrics-greenwich-caning-stretch-cotton/zprd_11053956a/#tabz), 2 polyester prints) for between 75-95% off.

I'm pretty happy with the whole thing since I just wandered in the place looking for a new zipper I was adding to thrift-store altered skirt I was finishing. Ahhhh yeah!

The coat has 20 or so sliced up Dalmatians embedded in the seams.  Just like a real fur coat, i stitched together 50 or so individual ""pelts"" to make it look authentic and to add body.  It's fully lined in some sort of red sateen that is pretty thick.  It's dirty as hell because I painted the town in it two different years.  


Oh, and I forgot, I wore a dress and red vinyl stripper boots and realized the first night why it is that women carry hand bags.  So I made a handbag with the leftover scraps.  Yes I am a man.  EDIT: A man who sews like a BADASS MOFO :D   


Here's the pics.  Sorry they're not labeled, I suck at the imgur thing.  The last one shows the inside seams, and also my cat Ted Danson.

I had done a few other projects with my sewing machine(mostly quilt work), but nothing like this. The Red dress is an Infinity dress. It was so easy, and I love to wear it. I will be making 1 for both of my sisters in the next week or so. The grey dress is a free pattern I found called the 'Coffee Date Dress'. Lots of fun. I learned alot making it. Especially with the facing around the neck and arm holes of the bodice. The black belt and sweater were extras I used when I wore the dress for the day and not something that were included in the pattern or anything. 
Now I just need it to be warm enough here to wear them comfortably!

I have been sewing for less than two years, but I don't mind taking on a challenge.  This one, however...whew!  I got the pattern from the book Sewn with Love by Fiona Bell.  Gorgeous vintage children's clothes in that book, but many reviews online say the patterns are error-filled, particularly the pattern for this dress.  Thankfully, someone on Amazon wrote a really good review of the book detailing exactly what the problems with this particular pattern are.  Armed with that knowledge, I was able to make the dress, but not without using every curse word I know.  I am most pleased with the results, even though my daughter smeared dayglo pink icing on it that will never ever ever come out:)

Edit:  Thank you everyone for your kind words - much appreciated!  

I have washed the dress once now:  as predicted, the pink food coloring did not come out, but it lightened up more than I would have thought so maybe she can actually wear this dress more than once!"	t5_2sczp	True

Erzsabet	63	7	36	"I think that we, as a community, should create some sewing courses of different levels to add to the University of Reddit project. There seems to be plenty of new people interested in learning how to sew, now we just need to come up with an easy to follow course.

Now, I may be pretty good at coming up with ideas, but I am terrible at explaining things, and teaching people, or writing things up. So if there are people out there who would be willing to take the info we gather and put it in a form that is easy to follow, that would be great. And if there are those out there who are good at making tutorial videos, those would be very welcome and appreciated.

Any current sewing/costuming/fashion/textile students out there who would be willing to share info/syllabuses/resources (books, websites, etc) that would be a huge help.

I think if we could all get behind this and make a sewing course to put up on the site it would be a huge help to many in the community.

So I guess first we should figure out what people would want to learn, and break it down into categories that we can build lessons off of.

Edit: I have created a subreddit for this project. Head on over to /r/UniversityofSewit if you'd like to help out!

The table is beautiful and worth the $20 alone, so even if the machine is dead, I wont regret the purchase. 

I live in a tiny apartment and promised my fiance that I wouldn't bring home any more furniture, so I had to leave it with his mother. She lives up a mountain and I hate driving home after dark, so I had to leave pretty quick after we got it unloaded. I did have enough time to spin the wheel a little, and everything moves and nothing made me nervous. I didn't get to plug it in though, so we'll see. It needs to be cleaned (so many cobwebs and so much dust!) but I have a feeling it will work just fine.

I forgot to snap a picture. I'll see if my MIL will get one for me tomorrow. In the mean time, any tips for cleaning/dusting/potential repairs?"	t5_2sczp	True

[The final product](http://imgur.com/MmUjD&amp;wwhfd&amp;OoA7I&amp;KOcF3&amp;yYbAY&amp;P6lDj#2). It hits 1"" below the knees and has natural waist.

This was my first pencil skirt. I have made some other clothing items (tops, skirts, dresses), so I did have some sewing experience.

At the beginning of the project I set myself a goal to only use the supplies I already had on hand, because I am a sewing hoarder :) The colors are a bit off - in reality everything is a bit more brick red than maroon, and the organza strip is more yellowish/golden/straw-y

Fabric - 100% heavy weight wool. Vintage, found at a flea market. Lining - 100% cotton. The wool feels nice and warm, but perhaps a bit too heavy for a skirt. I should have used it for a jacket or a vest of some sort. You can see [here](http://imgur.com/MmUjD&amp;wwhfd&amp;OoA7I&amp;KOcF3&amp;yYbAY&amp;P6lDj#1) how the fabric is too bulky and is kind of puffing out at the belt seam... that's after grading the seam and pressing it. 

I used Gertie's pencil skirt pattern and changed it just a little bit: added a vent instead of a slit in the back, added a lining. 

Some details:

Lapped zipper, [front](http://imgur.com/MmUjD&amp;wwhfd&amp;OoA7I&amp;KOcF3&amp;yYbAY&amp;P6lDj#3) and [inside](http://imgur.com/MmUjD&amp;wwhfd&amp;OoA7I&amp;KOcF3&amp;yYbAY&amp;P6lDj#0). Lapped zippers are easy and have a very classy look. Putting it in with a lining is a bit tricky, but it really just requires some hand basting and patience.

Bound buttonhole - you can kind of see it at the top of the outside lapped zipper picture. It was my first bound buttonhole; I have been so intimidated by them, because every tutorial starts off with scaring the crap out of you about how difficult they are. In reality they are awesome and fun to make! 

[Vent](http://imgur.com/wDgFH&amp;BZoyh&amp;3TSnw#2) - I decided to add a vent, but this happened on a whim, after I already made a muslin with a slit... So yes, mistakes were made. 

First of all, I made it too low, so when I realized that I wanted the whole skirt to be shorter, there was only so much I could do without totally getting rid of the vent. 

Second of all, lining with a vent was interesting. I used [this](http://www.afashionablestitch.com/2010/sewalongs/pencil-skirt-lesson-3-back-vent-tutorial-part-ii/) tutorial, and I guess I didn't mark the vent curve points correctly. So after a lot of sewing and resewing and resewing, I ended up with [this](http://imgur.com/MmUjD&amp;wwhfd&amp;OoA7I&amp;KOcF3&amp;yYbAY&amp;P6lDj#4), and you can clearly see my 2 struggle spots. They make me very very angry and I want to kill them. 

[Lining](http://imgur.com/wDgFH&amp;BZoyh&amp;3TSnw#0) and [hem](http://imgur.com/MmUjD&amp;wwhfd&amp;OoA7I&amp;KOcF3&amp;yYbAY&amp;P6lDj#5) - at first I was going to attach the lining hem to the skirt hem, but then decided not to, because I kind of liked the look of the lining hanging free. It clings to the skirt, so it is not like you can see a lining when you walk, but I like how the organza ribbon occasionally peaks at you. 

One big mistake I pretty much made - I didn't realize until _after_ I cut the pieces that I was working with a patterned fabric I had to match. The Sewing Gods were kind to me though, and somehow I managed to match almost everything up except for [this](http://imgur.com/wDgFH&amp;BZoyh&amp;3TSnw#1) side - you can see some squares don't quite line up.

Another mistake - I should have lined the belt with something heavier, I didn't predict well how heavy wool behaves. 

All in all I am happy with the result! This was my second piece that had a lining, and I don't think I will ever want to make a skirt or a dress unlined. It just totally changes the look and feel of the garment, all of a sudden it is more professional and you feel like you gained a sewing level. 

Let me know if you guys have any questions or advice! And I hope this is not too long :s

I used simplicity pattern 1819 as my sloper.

1353555961.0	13lqqm	I decided to try sewing and began making a circle skirt for my wife. She thought it was very weird. Any thoughts from the community?	ADH-Kydex	52	7	92	"Okay, in my defense I tend to find some strange hobbies and activities. If I see something that looks interesting and is remotely within my skill level I'll probably try it. This means everything from home roasting coffee to flying a kite with a camera. Sometimes I get fixated on an idea and I'll want to try it.

So, we like the look of retro clothing and we wanted to get some. We can't find any. I discover that a lot of the ladies sew their own, which makes sense. I like the DIY approach and figure sewing can't be that hard, I see a few pictures here of circle skirts and it seems like its easy enough. My mom gave me an old machine and I got it up and running, figured out how to string it (that took a while) and actually got it to sew. After a short while I have the beginnings of a skirt. So when I showed my wife I thought she would be happy to have new clothing, but instead she thought the whole thing was just very, very weird. I guess she expected a more manly pursuit (of which I have many). She was also pissed that I can't fix the basement doorknob but I have time to make a skirt. I'll get around to that knob eventually, I just don't give a shit about that.

**okay, here is the deal with the doorknob: she doesn't like it and wants a new one. I'm more worried about the thousand other projects that I am doing. That's it.**

**The point is that even without that issue, she found the idea of me sewing very strange which is what I was trying to focus on**

I wanted to add: I do a LOT of work on the house, its one of the three things that occupy my time anymore. I'm not letting the place fall down, I'm just not going to fix that knob. Its on my list, but there are bigger fish to fry.


So, people of sewit (admittedly not the most diverse group to ask this question) is this a weird thing to do? If you were dating a guy who did this would you gossip about this to your girlfriends? And do I really need a machine that can do zig-zag? 

Full disclosure: I'm finishing the damn skirt because I'm confident in my masculinity."	t5_2sczp	True

I am working my way into creating more daily clothing for myself and my two sons. I love the idea of the Burda magazines, but there doesn't seem to be much for guys contained within.

Princess_By_Day	44	2	41	"Other than the obvious straight seams and using the right fabrics for the right pieces, what is there that I can do to make garments I make look more polished? A lot of times I'll look at homemade garments, and just think ""hmmm something is not quite right"", but I can't ever put my finger on quite what it is that isn't right about the piece. 

Just as an example, [this dress](http://www.etsy.com/listing/66685980/zinas-black-tunic-womens-sweater-mini?ref=sr_gallery_27&amp;ga_search_query=sweater&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_ship_to=ZZ&amp;ga_min=0&amp;ga_max=0&amp;ga_search_type=handmade)* looks to me (I'm a total amateur, so maybe I'm wrong) like it's very well sewn, but for some reason it just looks very homemade to me. 

I have access to a serger, and I've heart that can make a big difference, but I was hoping someone could give me some more insight on how to improve my own sewing!

I was so happy with purchasing my own ""big"" thing for myself as I've recently started working in an intern position.

At the time I was making a [cosplay for Lili from the Tekken series](http://imgur.com/a/N0uaq) and decided to use my overlocker for that. The material I used frays REALLY easily and it was way too difficult to do the ruffles without having the edges surged (if that's the right word...).

This is also the first project where I have created my own pattern for the top, I did this by measuring how long I'd like the piece to be, then I copied the arm hole shape and sleeve shape from another pattern and adjusted it to how I wanted. 

I had to dye the fabric I used for the scarf, I seriously couldn't find black and red gingham fabric in any of the stores near me :( So I got black and white, dyed with red using some Rit dye. It was fun - the first time I also dyed something.

I wish I took more progress photos so I could have done a tutorial :( I just didn't think of it at the time."	t5_2sczp	True

I drafted the pattern and sewed the garment completely in 4 days. While it isn't my best work, I was pleased with how well it came together, and how recognizable the costume was.  I was very meticulous in including the details, and as such the costume had all the pockets from the cartoon, the same-fabric knee pads, front and back seams on the legs (INSTEAD of side seams.  THAT was a mind-fuck, I tell you whut!), stand collar and boob-enhancing front zip.

It's definitely a costume I hope to tweak a little (ie: go back and serge my seam allowances!) and wear to conventions. And yes, I know my hair shouldn't be like that, it was 40 degs C in that house and I was dying of heat!"	t5_2sczp	True

They brought in Connie Crawford to teach blouse pattern drafting/fitting.  
I was one of maybe three women that were new and the only one that didn't know anyone there.  

While Connie was wonderful and gave great information, as far as the rest of the experience... What a disappointment!  Friendly? Most certainly not!

All but one woman didn't even acknowledge my existence.  The leaders were too involved with their personal cliques to even do a greet/welcome.  The only other time anyone really said anything was to rather snootily tell me I was blocking their view.  This was after Connie told us to gather around and the person stayed in her seat, half the room away. 

They made the event available as a two day course that you could attend both days, or one or the other, then catered it to the ones that did both days.  

They initially gave me an out dated  packet, before going and getting one.  Then when I asked about how they were queuing the fitting (everyone was getting a custom blouse fitting by Connie herself) I was told I would be last because I didn't attend yesterday.  
I don't want special treatment, but I did expect it to be a fair draw for the attendees from today, especially after paying $50 for it.  

I've been to guild meetings for other arts and have never felt so unwelcome. As a chapter event, I can't help but wonder if this is a pretty good taste of what the neighborhood groups are like.   I'm really rethinking wanting to join.  Who wants to subject themselves to this?!

If you're lucky enough to have a guild that is warm and welcoming, appreciate it, I envy you.  

Edit: 7 hours later,  toward the end of the meeting, another lady came up and offered me the guild brochure and said ""we would love to have you join us.""  I almost laughed at loud.  A wee bit late don't you think?  i know i can learn a lot though, so I'm going to try to keep an open mind and at least give it a second chance.  "	t5_2sczp	True

Mostly things for kids (baby shoes, pants, bathrobe, dresses) and little crafty things like zipper pouches. I've also done two lap-sized quilts that I'm pretty proud of! I'm new to this community. 

Anyways, I'm ready to start making things for ME (instead of giving everything away), and my mom has offered to buy me a dress form for my 30th birthday next month. I know they make fancy ones that adjust, but I don't think I need anything like that. 

My question is: what's the difference between a $40 one on Amazon and a much more expensive one? I was going to do the duct-tape-t-shirt idea from Pinterest to make the dress form be my size. Is that a good idea?
