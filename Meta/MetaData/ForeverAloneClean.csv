It just makes me feel fucking happy. You get back from a 3 mile run and you feel fucking *fantastic*. I'm really depressed, and I spend a lot of time hating myself.

1333887516.0	rz589	Remember me? So, I went to get rid of my virginity with a prostitute. This is what happened.	incrediblylonely	723	162	195	"In [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/rslzh/25_years_passed_without_even_kissing_a_girl/) post I told you guys about my plans to rid myself of my virginity with the aid of an prostitute. So, I eventually decided to go ahead with it. Story time!

As I neared the ""sauna club"" entrance, I was nervous as hell. I mean, so nervous that my hands were shaking. Bravely I walked straight up to the door ignoring the other people and cars on the street. I rang the doorbell and was immediately buzzed in.

At the entrance there was an older woman who was extremely bubbly and upbeat. Her english was surprisingly good as she explained me the ropes. I nervously laughed as at one point she asked ""you know what goes on in here, right?"" Yeah, I knew. I got my robe (no wizard hat though) and went to the lockers to undress.

I walked to the main lounge and lo and behold, nude women everywhere. I was surprised that this didn't phase me in any way. Sure I hadn't seen anything like it before, but it was stunningly accurate to what I had imagined. I asked a very thrashy looking woman sitting by the doorway where the shower was and after five times explaining that no, I don't want to fuck her (she didn't seem to understand a word of english) she pointed me towards a toilet which had a shower in it. I washed myself unneccessarily well.

The other customers were just sitting around, glancing at me as I passed them. Many discreet ""hi, I know what you are doing here and I'm here for the same thing"" -nods were exchanged. Well, at least they seemed as awkward as I did.

I sat on a barstool, drank a coke and avoided ALL the eye contacts. I felt stupid as I sure as hell didn't come there for their excellent soft drink catalogue. Then I saw her. I hadn't really looked at the girl who served me the drink, but she was gut-wrenchingly cute. She sat on a couch looking sort of out-of-place, having a perfect posture and a curious look in her eyes as the other girls were just sort of lounging and tiredly staring at walls and such. ""Please, please talk english"" I thought to myself.

I sat myself next to her, and said hello. ""Hi! How are you?"" she chirped. We exhanged names and some really inane pleasantries but she seemed very nice. And oh god so pretty. I won't go into details but I just couldn't find a single flaw in her. After a while she asked me ""So, you wanna go upstairs?"" We negotiated the pricing and the use of condom (she would not do anything without one) and upstairs we went. I watched her perfect butt swing as she climbed the stairs and wondered to myself if it was OK to grab it. I didn't, just to stay safe. We found a vacant room and went in.

At this point she asked me how old I was. ""25"", I replied. ""Really? I'm 25 too! Well, 26 in four days."" I wondered how rare it is to know a prostitute's exact birth date as she kinda looked like she slipped it without intending to be so precise. I congratulated her on her birthday in advance.

She set up a large white sheet on the bed and gestured me to lie down. I felt like shitting a brick. I dropped my robe and lied down on the bed. My cock looked like had went into hiding somewhere inside my body. I comforted myself thinking that she probably knows penises do that. She then took off her panties and sat next to me, stroking my leg. Stroking my leg! This it it, more action in one simple gesture than I have had in my whole lifetime! I felt so nervous that I don't think I remembered to breathe. ""When's the last time you had sex?"" Oh god. SHE KNOWS. Why did she even ask that? I couldn't bring myself to tell her I was a virgin, so I made up a lie that sounded about as much pathetic: ""Oh not in a while. Like, not in a couple of.. um.. years."" She didn't even flinch. She moved her hand down to my tiny member and started stroking it. Before I could react she plopped a tit in my mouth. I awkwardly licked and kissed her boobs. They didn't taste like anything. Maybe a bit bitter because of a deodorant? My weewee didn't show any signs of life. ""You can touch me"", she said. Oh, right! I have hands! Crazy shit! I stroked her back a bit and massaged her boobs. Boobs are actually rather boring, I thought. 

""Can I see your pussy?"" I heard myself ask. She sat on her back and opened her legs. Well, there it was. The elusive female genitalia. In plain sight, and not on a computer screen. And it was incredibly beautiful. Shaved, tidy and clean. I asked her if I could touch her there. ""Yes but not inside and be careful"". I stroked her pussy a bit. It felt rubbery and warm, and surprisingly rigid. I had always imagined pussy lips to be softer, like the skin of testicles. She breathed heavily as I stroked her. The stubble above her pussy felt rough.

""Do you want me make blowjob?"" I decided against correcting the errors in how she make english and just nodded. I was still completely flaccid. She took out a condom, somehow got it on me and went to town. An actual sex act! I am now a man who has received a blowjob. I heard the xbox ""achievement unlocked"" -sound in my head and could't help but giggle a bit. She glanced at me quizzically and I just motioned her to go on. And go on she did. For many minutes. Nothing. I felt nothing. I wasn't even mildly aroused. A total dreamgirl had my cock in her mouth and I did not give a shit and neither did my penis. It barely reached a semi and then went to sleep again. ""What's wrong? You don't like the condom?"" ""Maybe, I don't know. I'm very nervous.""

""Maybe I do with my hand?"" She took the rubber off, marinated my wiener with lube and started jerking it. ""Well this I do much better myself"", I thought. After a while I tried to tell her how to gently massage the tip while working the shaft but she either rubbed it raw or I felt nothing. My penis looked pathetic. This was not cool. Handjobs apparently suck.

""Can I taste your pussy?"" I asked. ""Sure, just not too hard okay?"" I had no idea what would be too hard but I promised her I'd be careful. ""How do we..."" -""Sixty-nine"", I answered before she could finish her sentence. She got an another condom, put it on me (still don't know how she managed that), positioned herself accordingly and landed her pussy on my face. I gave it a few kisses, and started clumsily licking it. I had expected it to have a taste or at least a smell of some sort, but there was none. I was dissapointed. I had wanted to know what pussy smells and tastes like, but her showering was apparently as impeccable as mine.

So, I was living the dream. A perfect young girl, far, FAR cuter and smarter than I had dared to hope was doing her absolute best to get me off. I wasn't even nervous anymore, I was just frustrated. After almost an hour of her heroic sucking and licking of my flaccid member I decided to call it quits. It was simply not happening. ""The problem isn't down there, it's up here"", she said, tapping her head. Yup. There just was no mood whatsoever. I was maddeningly attracted to this girl but I could not have an erection. I had even abstained from masturbating for several days to make sure I was extra horny but I just wasn't. She was sincerely worried about me, and I tried to comfort her by saying that I knew very well that something like this could happen. ""Maybe it's just not my thing, this prostitution"", I said. She thought for a while and said: ""It is difficult, you don't know me and this place is new and everything is new.. Maybe you come see me again someday? Or you just do it with a girlfriend."" Yeah. Maybe.

We got up, and I paid her 100 euros for the hour of almost-sexing. She asked me to hang around and maybe have a snack (there was free food) but I just wanted the hell out, so I declined. She then hugged me and gave me a little kiss on the cheek as a goodbye and looked deep into my soul through my eyes. My mind exploded. That was it. It felt miles better than anything she had done to me in the room just because it was genuine and sincere. I felt so silly. Whatever I wanted, this wasn't the place to get it from.

Before that little hug and kiss I felt super mopey and just planned to get drunk and maybe weep my eyes out. After it, I was glowing. The receptionist probably thought I had had the most insane turbosex ever and had a coy smile as I gave her the locker keys back.

Yeah, prostitution isn't my thing. I'm glad I'm still at least technically a virgin. Oddly enough I'm also glad that I did this. Sex is nothing but an instrument of love. Without love it's just mechanics. I must try to get my shit together and find that love.

TL;DR: Tried to lose my virginity with a whore, didn't get it up. Shit was awesome."	t5_2s3yz	True

*""I've been around long enough and have seen enough supposedly FA women - none of them were actually alone - all had friends, sex lives, relationships, the ability to actively choose etc. etc. etc. Sure, if there are women out there who are actually alone, then I'm wrong. So far I haven't been proven wrong, however.""*

I would very much like, for the sake of reducing ignorance and sexism on /r/foreveralone, if female users could share, even if briefly, their story. I'm sure you're out there, this can't be just a male problem. I hate the amount of disrespect you receive. I want you to be included.

Finally, I'm sorry to ask you to upvote this so more people can see it, I don't get karma for it, and it would be a shame if this was missed. If it's any consolation, [here is a gif of a giant nazi robot with a flaming chainsaw](http://i.imgur.com/vFaId.gif)

1325799251.0	o4h3s	I have a girlfriend. This is by a wide margin the least likely thing that's ever happened.	mathyr	434	98	112	"In November, I wrote [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/mhty2/turning_25/). I meant every word. Hitting 25 with no romantic or sexual experience at all convinced me that I should give up on the idea altogether and just accept my state of being. 

A few short weeks later, and I have a girlfriend. It’s genuinely surreal. She’s cute, and friendly, and nerdy, and bright, and on the whole out of my league altogether, but for some insane reason she likes me. She pursued me (via OkCupid), and we steadily escalated our contact. On our first date we clicked, and her interest in me seemed to skyrocket.

**I have absolutely no idea what I’m doing.** But it’s going as well as it possibly could be. I’m no longer a virgin to kissing, hand holding, or sex. More importantly, I’ve found someone who I can be myself with, and who has all the positive qualities I could hope for in a long-term partner. 

I don’t want to blow this out of proportion -- plenty of promising relationships fail to last, and it's still early. I can’t pretend like I’ve solved my FAness, because I’m still the same person I’ve always been. But for now, at least, I’m not alone. And I’m going to be a good boyfriend to ensure, as best I can, that I don’t have to be anymore. 

I’m posting this because I’ve shared a lot of negativity here, and now that I can I feel I should share some genuine positivity. I don’t know what I did to inspire the affection of this wonderful girl, but I won’t take it for granted. I hope it lasts, and I hope you all wind up as lucky as I suddenly am. :)"	t5_2s3yz	True

1322288991.0	mpnla	How to avoid fake friends and save yourself a world of annoyance.	Jareth86	393	54	50	"I have noticed a disturbing trend in r/Foreveralone. Many of you have friends, who are not actually your friends, and they seem to make you miserable. These supposed friends never seem to invite you places, yet always hang out with eachother and have a blast.

I once knew people like this in college. They would drive out to the ocean on long weekends in college, and drink, shoot pool, and swim all day at one of their parent's beach houses. They would laugh, carve things, take photos, and NEVER fucking invite me.

So one Friday, I asked If I could come along. They looked away uncomfortably and told me that the car was full. BULLSHIT. They had three cars and 12 people.

It was at this moment that I had an epiphany: Were these people really my friends? The more I thought about it, the more I wondered. They laughed at my jokes, I ate with them often, and we seemed to get along great, but I was never invited anywhere, and I'd have to catch them for dinner as they left; they'd never come to my room or text me.

But how to find out? Well, I decided to test our ""friendship"" with a simple little experiment. I decided to not speak again in the group for the next three weeks until someone said something to me, and not do anything with them unless I was invited/texted/etc.

And that was it. In all those weeks, no one said a damn thing to me, and when I stopped showing up to dinner, I did not even get so much as a single text from ***ANY*** of them.

It was then that I made the terrifying (at the time) decision to completely abandon this group of so-called friends and find an entirely new group of people to hang out with. It took an entire year of college, but through a few clubs, I ended up meeting the coolest fucking people I'd ever met in my life, and discovering that, when people actually cared what I had to say and invited me places, I was HAPPY.

There was one night they were planning a massive party (and invited me); I found out a week before that I would be out of town that week on a family trip. When I texted them, the MOVED THE ENTIRE GODDAMN PARTY over a week just so I could attend.

This is what actual friendship is. You don't have to chase friends around to hang out with them. Ever."	t5_2s3yz	True

1356283392.0	15bynl	A girl actually said yes when I asked her out.	dutch010	378	61	109	"She's in my class since September but we're both quiet. We ran a hotel with several classes as a project assignment. I asked her if she was going to a party later that night and I requested a dance there. She couldn't dance to my relieve, because rhythm and I don't go hand in hand. Instead we talked for hours on a couch in the back. The following friday we all went home at the end of the semester and I would never see her again, she lives 40 minutes away and she attends another ~~school~~ college. 

I walked up to her and her friends with sweaty hands and told her I liked hanging out with her and if she wanted to go out sometime. She excitedly said yes. We had one last trip with classmates prior to the holidays and I asked her to have a drink and explore the city. I put my hand in hers when she said she had cold hands. We took the train home and listened to music together (we both like older (rock) music). I put my arm around her and she rested her head on my shoulder *This was new for me in my 20 years of living, I was okay with this*

Our teachers sat a few rows in front of us and one of them gave me a thumbs up when he passed by us. I took a leap of faith by giving her a kiss on the cheek. She responded by kissing me. It felt natural. It felt right.

We had a date 2 days later (last friday night *ignore Rebecca Black flashback*) We walked through town hand in hand and had a few drinks. We kissed again when I dropped her off by the train. I never thought I'd ever find a girl who would like me, so this sudden mutual interest from a girl I really like is fantastic. We're texting daily now, so I hope I'll continue to see this girl.

Stand strong, folks. A person to fill the void can show up out of the blue.

**TL;DR**

A girl was brave enough to cross paths with me.

The unfuckable women? They exist. They're everywhere, but you don't notice them. You only notice the women you find attractive, and then you whine about how ""they can get whoever they want"". Well of course they can, they're attractive women... Just like attractive men can get sex. The unfuckable FA women, who feel just like you, you just don't see them. They don't show up as *women* on your radar. Just like your sister, mother, elderly neighbour, little girls don't count as real women because you don't want to stick your dick in them, those women you don't even see as a member of the female gender.

And here's you're creating the ""*real* women can get sex whenever they want"". And those FA girl try, and fail. Thus they're not *real* women.

Y'see, when you condescendingly tell a girl that she *can't* be a FA, you're degrading her. Just like the rest of the world, you're not acknowledging her existence. She's not a woman to you... she's not a human being to you.

She feels like she's not a human being, like she's some kind of an alien, not allowed to exist.

**Imagine coming to this subreddit, being promised comfort and sympathy, only to be shunned and ignored.**

Male FAs, you're lucky in a way... the world at least acknowledges your existence. Female FAs, well... I guess you're just subhuman; not even deserving of existing."	t5_2s3yz	True

1349622622.0	1137xd	My dream life is being lived directly above me. What do I do?	Fathrowaway1B	356	90	277	"I've lived in the apartment I'm in now for a little over a year. When I first moved in, I immediately noticed that the floor above my bedroom is made of paper mache. Sound travels through it so easily, it's like being in the room. 

A month after I moved in, a beautiful girl moved in above me. She was in amazing shape, and her mine craft shirt made me realize we probably had a lot in common. I saw her moving in, and thought about offering to help, but out of a stupid fear of rejection, I mearly waved to her as I passed by on the way in. I'm retarded. 

Unfortunately, the guy in the apartment next to mine was not retarded. He took one look at her and stole the opportunity that I had so stupidly passed up while I sat on my ass watching playing Skyrim. 

I heard their entire conversation as I sat there, feeling stupid. They talked about every nerdy subject under the sun, from Miyazaki movies, to Earthbound, to the wii's failings; EVERYTHING I would have spoken to her about, had I just had the balls to speak up! 

I sat there, listing as he asked her out, and as she said yes. I felt like I was being punished for my stupidity, as if the world was like: HEY ASSHOLE, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN YOU! 

It's been months now, and they're still together. I know this, because he spends every night at her place, and they talk to each other about everything they can think of until the sun rises. Conversations I've dreamed of having in bed with a girl my entire life. They talk about life on other planets, old episodes of DS9, growing up, old video games, and everything else I love every night. And I can hear every word. Even when they have sex, I can hear every laugh; they sound happy doing everything. Sometimes, when they talk at night, I close my eyes and pretend I'm there with her, laying by her side. It pains me even more, since her boyfriend responds almost exactly the same as I would have. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I've politely asked them to talk a bit quieter, but even if they whispered, I'd still be able to hear through these crappy floors. I feel like I'm losing my mind; like I'm being punished for my idiocy, and the punishment just won't end. I just wish I could go back and speak to her, but now I'm forced to relive my mistakes every night! 

I'm losing my mind. What should I do?! 

TL;DR: Passed up a change to meet an amazing girl. Now I hear her talking to her boyfriend every night, and feel like shit about it.

EDIT: Jareth86 and Xoteatl_000 have it right. I am going to try and befriend the happy couple, and get to know them. They both seem cool and fun. I also need to accept the fact that those two were fated, and I would have probably just been friendzoned in the end by her. "	t5_2s3yz	True

As we pulled into the parking spot, he told me that he didn't like me and didn't want to see the movie with me. I asked him why he asked me to go to a movie if he was just going to ditch me. He told me he was going to see a movie with another girl and needed a ride. I started crying and he just opened the door and got out. As i was driving off, I saw him hugging the girl he was meeting there. That was one of the worst nights of my life.

I'm going to ask this cute girl at our university bookstore out for coffee. If she says no well dammit, im going to stand up again and ask someone else! Don't misunderstand, I might be feeling brave but I have never felt so scared and nervous. Wish me luck brothers and sisters. Going to pretend I'm going in there for supplies, and going to strike a conversation and ask her out for coffee.

Edit:UPDATE

//**  8:42 PM   4/15/13 ** //

Went during my lunch break to the bookstore, all pumped up. I walked in and made my way to the art supplies to scope the area to see where she was, I even grabbed some scantrons to make it look legit. Its kinda funny, I'm a finance major so I wouldnt be looking for art supplies. She wasn't behind the counter, instead there were these two other girls... so no dice. She wasnt there. 

No worries, I'm trying again during the weekend. I hadn't even considered a scenario with coworkers around her, which makes it embarrasing, I'd have to be some sort of playboy to do that with their friends / coworkers looking. I haven't given up all, I am going again this weekend!  Walking in there made me feel alive again. No worries fellow redditors, I will keep trying and hopefully encourage you all to take that step. I will provide a pic without being to creepy if something happens. Sorry to disappoint you all if you expected a happy ending, I will keep trying, I don't think you can get anything without any effort, I think the same applies for relationships.

SUMMARY: 
She wasn't there, I'm going to try again this weekend.

UPDATE

//** 6:49PM   4/20/13  **//

Rushed this morning to the bookstore, she was there!  Alone with no coworkers, so it wasn't as nerve racking. She was behind the counter, but she came over to help me. And again I purchased stuff I didnt need.... Didn't want to ask her out of the blue...so i brought up school. We talked for maybe 3-5 minutes, I honestly don't know long we were talking but I was enjoying it. After what seemed like forever I asked her in these exact works, ""would you like to get some coffee sometime?"". And she had that akward look on her face. ""I'm sorry I have a boyfriend.""  I replied, ""Oh, I'm sorry,"" and thanked her for her help. Rushed out of their so fast. I could tell I was disappointed when I was driving away super fast. But I promised myself I wouldnt drink over this or overanalyze it like I have always done. One of the things I learned to do after getting rejected from a crush was running.

If you just want someone to hang out with and talk to I can video chat, voice chat, and just instant message. Whatever helps!

For the first time ever, I took a girl out on a date last night (yes, she knew it was a date) and at the end of it, got the usual ""I want to be friends"" line when I asked her to date me further. We didn't do anything physical.

I'm very very happy about how last night went, believe it or not. Know why? Because this is the first time I've gathered up the balls to actually ask a girl out and be one-on-one with her in a date setting. In my 21 years, I've never done it before... and I crossed that barrier yesterday.

It was a rejection but now I'm going to have an easier time popping the ""date"" question to girls. It's like a load has been lifted off my shoulders.

In fact, I think I'm gonna ask out the cute cashier girl who works at my university cafeteria next week. And if that fails, I'll ask the girl whom I sit with in chemistry class all the time, pretty sure she's into me. Wish me luck!"	t5_2s3yz	True

1363351373.0	1achza	Friend wrote this about being Forever-Alone	FourLokoKills	248	38	46	"People think it's the alone of being forever alone that hurts the most, but that's not true. Everybody's alone sometimes, whether for periods when they're not dating anyone or just for a weekend while their spouse is at a conference. Alone is part of the human condition. It's the forever that pulls down the corners of your mouth just a little bit when you give someone a smile meant to indicate that everything's okay with you even though you want to scream that nothing's okay and never will be. It's the forever that tastes bitter in the back of your throat when you see a happy couple walking in the park or laughing in a restaurant. It's the forever that has you wide awake staring at your ceiling into the wee hours of the morning.Forever alone.

There's an ongoing half-serious claim in our culture that men think about sex all the time. Every 17 seconds or so. That may be true for some guys but not a forever alone. After awhile you stop being able to think about sex, at least the way other people do. You can think about it abstractly, or when watching other people perform a stylized version of it alone in your room while you use your hand to joylessly complete a sad shadow of the biological imperative, but you stop being able to imagine sex as something you could be a part of. You see a woman in the springtime, her midriff peeking out from between the soft cotton of a shirt and the rougher waist of a pair of jeans. You start to imagine her naked, constructing a fantasy in detail, the way her breasts would sit against her chest, the soft down or absence thereof on her pubic area, and then you try to insert yourself into her presence and the fantasy crumbles to dust under the weight of its own absurdity. You know there's no chain of events, no course of actions, that could lead to that ill defined imaginary room where the two of you would meet in an act of carnal congress. There's no way to there from where you are, it's not even an alternate universe, it's an inconceivable one. It's like trying to imagine a world where everything else is the same except elephants float around like helium balloons and have to be anchored by their trunks or they'll float away. An inherently absurd thought. That's the idea of you and her being intimate. So you look away from that tiny sliver of skin, trying to keep your face from contorting in pain and bitterness. Where other men might smile at her you don't, because your smile sucks, and you suck. Forever alone.

Eventually you don't even bother to build the image only to have it blow it away like a sand painting in a tornado. You imagine lesser things. The brush of a cool, soft, feminine hand against yours. Mundane couple bullshit like eating pancakes on a Sunday morning or watching a movie or just sharing your day with someone who gives a fuck and is not your mother. The other party in these pathetic little domestic tableaus is ill defined in your mind, because if you imagined her clearly enough to make her realistic then you know she wouldn't want you. And even with this feminine blur, this placeholder, this blurry silhouette of nothingness you project your emotions onto, the person she's with isn't really you. It's a better version of you, a thinner less obnoxious version who will control his temper before saying something cutting, who doesn't geek out and talk too much, who is free from the flaws who make you who you are and assure that nobody else will ever want to share their life with that person. Then you realize that you're fantasizing about an Archie Comics version of yourself making tomato soup for an undefined feminine projection blob, and you realize that even the part of you that creates these images doesn't want to be with you and can't imagine anyone who might. Forever alone.

Around you the world stays mostly the same. People fall in love, hit milestones, get married, have kids. You're even jealous of the divorcees because you know that this is just a bump in the road for them, part of their journey. You're still at the starting line watching them recede, wanting to chase them and catch up, knowing you never will. But while the world is almost static, you are aging. Moving through your life alone. You start to get bitter at the milestones you've missed and the chances you'll never have. You see the graying of your hair and the years piling on like rust eating at the hull of a decommissioned ship and you realize that your opportunity for young love is already past. Even if you got it together and got in the game you'd just have a shot at middle aged love. It doesn't matter if you think women age like a fine wine, what wine connoisseur wants to live his life without ever tasting the shocking astringency of the harsh tanins of youth. Even if that's not your thing you don't want to cut it off forever. But you have. You won't even have memories of those very good years, as the song says, to keep you warm as you slide towards your dotage. All you have is your bursting store room of regrets and bitterness, and you can always cram in more. And you know that that rusty battleship will some day have a hole in its hull and be unfixable, good for nothing more than salvage scrap. You add up the time it would take to lose the weight, get your teeth fixed, figure out your professional career, the time until you can smile at that woman in the coffee shop with confidence rather than the stomach sickness of self hate, and you realize it all adds up to a very big number. Everyone thinks of themselves as eternally 22 but at some point you are forced to admit that you are 37 and half your life is over and the back nine of the remaining half is not a time when people finally get that whole dating thing right. If the window is not closed its halfway there and sliding fast. Forever alone.

All this breeds desperation and depression so you shove it back because you need to function, you need to keep eating and staying warm, you can't just stop and feel. But your dam is fragile and it leaks. And when you see that girl whose hand you want to brush against, who could sit with you looking into your eyes through the steam coming off her coffee cup and just be, who could understand you (she probably couldn't, but this is something men like to project on to women) you feel the dam start to buckle and the river behind it start to surge and you don't want to break down crying in the coffee shop because that's not what people do and if you can't have love at least you can have dignity, or the appearance of dignity, or the delusion of the appearance of dignity, so you turn your face to the side, you hope and pray she doesn't try to draw your attention (generally safe on that count, old chum) and you put one fucking foot in front of the other and continue down your sad and barren blighted path. Forever alone."	t5_2s3yz	True

Getting out of that car and walking into that store was the hardest thing I've ever done. And after an awkward moment where I almost accidentally let a cat run out of its cage, she saw me. And looked genuinely happy about it. We talked for like 30 mins before I had to go, and she told me I should volunteer there with her. Then I left.

This girl was gorgeous. I wanted to say something but I was too shy to even advance. I told my friend about it adn he said I should make a move. I didn't because I was so scared (rejection sucks) and he just said you loss man. I sat back another 20 minutes messing around on my laptop. I go to my desktop to open a folder when something hits me right there.

On my desktop was a quote from a anime called Gurren Lagann. It was a picture of the two main characters and the saying ""Forget the risk, take the fall. If it's what you want, it's worth it all."" Right then, something clicked for me. I got up and slowly made my way over to the table she was sitting by just repeating the words over and over in my head. I finally got to the table, and asked if I could sit with her. She accepted and I talked for a solid hour with her.  

I was nervous as hell, but I managed to get some questions out. Eventually I asked for her number and got it. It felt really good. i haven't felt this accomplished in a while. Step 1 out of FA is complete. I gotta make it to step 2, and hopefully I don't fail. I just wanted to share this with you guys since this is such a huge thing to me. Confidence and seeing that quote gave me the courage to go over there and talk to her. Who knew anime could actually be inspiring."	t5_2s3yz	True

1332298960.0	r66gg	No longer Forever Alone!	areyoutalkingaboutme	227	45	84	"I've always been the ""forever alone"" type, both in status and spirit. It's a joke between me and my closest friends, and I laugh about it, too; I agree that it's funny. A friend bought me a forever alone shirt as a joke, and I wear it once in awhile for kicks. But recently, something great happened to me.

Several weeks ago, while wearing this shirt in a class, I momentarily look up as the prettiest girl in the class walks in. She happens to be wearing a tank-top with the ""Fuck Yeah"" guy on it. I stare in hysterical amazement, that such an admirable girl is possibly into Internet culture like me. Fantasies flood my mind as quickly as her beauty floods my heart. I'm immediately enamored. But, of course, I don't take action, and I shy away when she looks at me.

After class, I'm about to leave, and she calls my name. I turn around, confused as to who might be addressing me, and to my disbelief its her. She compliments my shirt, saying that its cool that I'm into memes and stuff. I return the compliment, and she asked if we could get a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/Kb79x.jpg) and my number! 

The tale is fairly typical from there. We started talking regularly, and over time, have grown really close. We are currently dating, and I have proudly hung up my shirt in the farthest reaches of my closet."	t5_2s3yz	True

I am so happy right now.

Not angry at any one Redditor but at myself because this is exactly how I acted in my late teens and twenties.  It took me until now, in my mid-30s, to realize just how self-sabotaging my behavior was.  And the scary thing is that the things I fixed were generally easy to do.  So, if you will indulge me, allow me to pass along some words of advice from an older FA to you all.

(Before I start, my FA pedigree:  short, fat, balding, poor teeth, shy, bouts of depression, poor conversationalist, no girlfriend since age 15, my friends all live in different countries or long trips away)

* **Tip 1: Negativity is toxic.**  I remember going out with friends to parties and always trying to be the quiet, sullen, philosophical type.  I spoke as if I were 45 year old grizzled war veteran as it pertained to the topic of dating and love.  And guess how much that got me laid: exactly 0 times.  People don't want to be around that person.  People don't want to be depressed.  

*So how do I improve?*  Well, just don't be an emo mopey bitch...at least externally.  I am not saying you don't have the right to feel.  You are free to feel how you want.  But just keep it to yourself.  You would be surprised how much more people want to interact with you when you are at least positive.

* **Tip 2: Basic Hygiene.**  A couple years so, I looked at a picture of myself when I was around 21.  And I had never noticed it before but there was the most disgusting looking unibrow ever.  I have no idea how I missed it when I was younger.  About 4 years ago, I started noticing I was getting the old man ear/nose hair problem.  It honestly can be a pain in the ass somedays to groom and sometimes I don't do it everyday.  But if I am going out to meet people or on a date, I sure as shit check all my problem areas.

*So how do I improve?*  This is so simple, I should slap you for asking.  Just be somewhat hygienic.  Even if you think you do a pretty good job (as I did despite the fact that I was rocking a Neanderthal brow), quadruple check anyway.  Go into a different room with different lighting and look in a mirror.  You would be surprised how much that will bring to light.  

For those of you who are heavy acne sufferers, it's not easy but you gotta do what you gotta do.  It will take a lot of work.  Find whatever it is in this world that helps your condition and make that your second job.  There are no free lunches in this world.

And for those of you who may be rocking a neck beard, it needs to go or at the very least, trimmed very, very short and clean.  This bit of advice comes from a woman who was asked by a friend of mine why she wasn't interested in a mutual friend of ours.  His neck beard was a total turn off.  And this view was followed up by a second woman as well.  

* **Tip 3:  Look decent.**  I worked split shifts at a really dirty job for a good portion of my teens and my 20s.  So most of my time was spent in clothing that didn't look real hot.  In addition to that, since I knew that most of my time was spent in shit clothing, I didn't make much effort to buy a lot of nice clothing.  It's amazing how much better you look (and feel) in something that looks decent.

*So how do I improve?*  Sweat pants: no.  T-shirts: no.  Stains/holes: no and no.  Ill fitting:  no.  For my fellow fatty brothers, look in a mirror and lift your arms.  Can you see the bottom of your stomach?  Yes?  Then the shirt doesn't fit.  The beautiful thing is that you don't have to break the bank to look nice.  Places like Wal-mart/K-Mart/Sears have decent clothing.  And don't be afraid to go to Old Navy (fatty friendly).  If you do have money, there is NO excuse not to be dressed nice.  

* **Tip 4:  DO NOT MISTAKE POLITENESS FOR ROMANTIC INTEREST.**  Let me say that once again.  **DO NOT MISTAKE POLITENESS FOR ROMANTIC INTEREST.**  BIGGEST mistake I made.  And I made it over and over and over again.  A girl would talk to me and I would think that she wanted my sack.  And I would make a move and get denied.  I swear to god, if I had $10 bucks for ever time I did this, I would make Bill Gates look like a poor ass slob.  

*So how do I improve?*  My solution to this issue was this: I just went into every situation with a female thinking she wasn't going to be interested.  BUT I didn't act like a mopey bitch about it.  I just had fun getting to know the person.  And guess what?  I made a lot of really good female friends that way.  So you might now be thinking, ""Ahhh, I see your ploy old man.  Get in good with them, sneak under their RADAR and make your attack.""  That actually leads me to #5....

* **Tip 5:  Be genuine.**  The answer to the hypothetic statement above is ""No, no I don't do that.""  I am just their friends.  On the odd occasion, it did go further than just friends (because she instigated it, not me).  Most times it didn't.  But either way, I was happy with the outcome.  Added to that is this very, very important piece of advice: DON'T HAVE ULTERIOR MOTIVES.  Don't do nice things for them JUST because you are trying to win their heart.  Don't break your back trying to give them things or buy them things or do favors for them.  The only thing you will end up with is a broken back, a broken wallet and a broken heart.

*So how do I improve?*  Treat them the same way you would treat any of your friends (and for those of you who will inevitably point out that you have no friends at all, treat them the way you would want to be treated...then remove the sexual component from that).

* **Tip 6:  Don't be picky.**  This one is seemingly common sense but apparently it's not.  If you are alone, and want to be with somebody, but you are narrowing down the field of people whom you are willing to be with, then you have no one to blame but yourself.  The biggest problem I had when I was younger was there was a huge disconnect between what I thought I could get and what I could realistically get.  But as I got older, I began to recognize this disconnect and started readjusting my view.  I began to learn that 7s were my new 10s.  And honestly, there is no shame in that.  If they make you happy, fuck everybody else.

*So how do I improve?*  As I said above, this one should be common sense.  By all means, feel free to have a couple of must haves or must nots but if your list of things gets past 2 or 3 items (or your items are very specific), it's too much.  Obviously it would be nice to have somebody who likes the same things you like but, maybe, instead of thinking ""XX needs to like Dr. Who"" you could think ""XX doesn't mind that I like Dr. Who.""  If there are 5 people, 1 who likes Dr. Who, 1 who hates it and 3 who don't give a shit either way, that change of thinking just increased your potential partners from 1 to 4. 

* **Tip 7:  Work to your strengths.**  Yeah, it sucks.  The ""normal"" people or the ""good looking people"" have it so easy.  They just walk up to a dude or a chick and 30 minutes later they are sexing in the back of their Camaros.  This one was hard for me because when you feel like shit because you are lonely, you don't much feel like looking at all your good parts.  But there was one thing that I did notice.  I could easily make people laugh.  So that was my thing.  I wasn't going to be the super hot guy nor was I going to be the super rich guy nor was I going to be the super smart guy.  I was going to be the fat, funny guy.  And you know what?  It worked.  Did that mean I was scoring with chicks left and right?  No.  But people didn't ignore me and some even wanted to hang out with me.  Whenever I would go out to a party, people would be genuinely happy that I was there.

*So how do I improve?*  Each and every one of you have something you are good at.  It might be something as crazy and complex as you can build elaborate and neat looking things.  It might be something as simple as you are genuinely a good listener.  Whatever it is, that can be your thing.  Use it to your advantage.  *(NOTE:  In as much as I hate to say this and as much as I truly believe everybody should be free to explore whatever interests you want, if your thing is knowing a lot about something in the realm of Sci-Fi/Anime/Comics, unless you are in a group of people where it has been established that it is socially acceptable within the group, you might want to bring something else to the party.  Oh, and if you are a Brony, just knock that shit off.  Seriously, shit's creepy, yo!)*

* **Tip 8:  You're gonna fail but don't give up.**  I don't mean this in a ""You can do it Slugger!  Go get 'em!"" sort of way.  I mean that if you don't put yourself out there, you aren't going to find anybody.  I had long, long spells after getting denied where I just gave up, turned into a hermit and didn't care.  Here is the thing.  Those potential mates out there don't care.  They don't even know you aren't in the field.

*So how do I improve?*  Simple.  Dust yourself off and go for it again.  BUT, it is VERY VERY important that when you do, you...

* **Tip 9:  Don't be bitter.**  This is related to what I said above in terms of having a positive attitude while meeting people whether you really feel it or not.  People can sense that.  Bitterness is the anti-poon.

*So how do I improve?*  Understand that person B had nothing to do with what person A did to hurt you (and if they did, why are you even talking with them in the first place).  Also understand that person B probably doesn't want to hear about person A and what they did/didn't do.  Be interested in person B.  The hell with person A.

And last of all, the most important thing...

* **Tip 10:  Learn from your mistakes.**  I have a FA friend who is about 10 years younger than I.  And it makes me so frustrated to see him do the exact same shit over and over and fail each and every time.  He gets all butt-frustrated over the fact that he can't find anybody but he doesn't change his methods at all.  But I did the same thing, too.  I was set in my thinking that said course of action was what successful people did to get a mate.  But what I was overlooking is that I also had other things working against me (read items 1-9).  My rule of thumb is this:  if something didn't work once, perhaps the girl didn't take to it.  If that thing didn't work 2 times, it's a bad thing.  


So after saying all that, here is the kicker:  I still fail more than I succeed.  Yeah, it sucks but I understand that is part of the process.  And I still have to work hard to get what I do get (which is admittedly not a whole lot).  But when I do succeed, it's great.  I earned it.  It makes each **[Contents filtered due to decency and morality standards]** that much better.  And you know what.  Success often begets success.  It's a lot easier to win after the first victory.

Finally, it's really easy to blame other things and people.  ""If they just got to know me..."" or ""They just go for the hot/normal people because...""  Guess what: that's life.  There are people out there who have a much easier time finding people just like there are people out there who are a lot better at math or at fixing cars or at peeing their names in the snow.  It really comes down to two choices: surrender because life isn't easy/""fair"" or do the (sometimes hard) work that will help improve your chances.  It took me a long time to finally choose the latter.  It's like that really dumb saying goes: ""Nothing ever changes if nothing ever changes.""

That is a choice you all have to finally make for yourselves."	t5_2s3yz	True

I remember it like it was yesterday.
I am 39 y.o., male, and I've decided to kill myself at exactly 12:00 tomorrow
morning. I simply cannot stand the loneliness and the constant dissapointments
anymore.
I've thought for months about it and I've come to my decision.
I hoped that perhaps something would change, something different would happen,
but the months passed and every day is exactly the same like the one before.
I am so sexually frustrated that I'm making thoughts about raping women.
I'm becoming a danger to society. It takes everything I got to not touch a woman
that's sitting to close to me on a bus or at the movies. I want someone to touch me,
I want to feel a person next to me, even for a hug.
I was patient for 10 years but now I admit that I've lost the fight. 
There's no hope any more. I've got no strength left to fight.

I don't understand this world. I am not ugly. I am not even socially awkward.
I'm an average guy with average looks. I am poor as fuck with a shitty job but I
am intelligent, I have many hobbies and interests, I am funny. Still, those things are
obviously not enough. It's ok. I don't care anymore.

A little background. I am 39. First time I had sex I was 25. I've had sex with 4 different women,
every one of them was a great woman, beautiful, intelligent, with class. I've had a relationship with
all 4 of them. In the end, they all left me. It was mainly my job situation. I understand that and I hold them no grudge. Now they are all happily married with children. I've had 4 years that were good.
From 25-29, you could say I had a life. For the past 10 years I've been single. I've never even met
a woman, never even been on a date. At least I can say that I was happy for a small part of my life,
I guess that will have to do. 

I left a letter to my family and to a few good friends.
I'va gathered as much money as I could and I plan to have 12 hours of enjoyment.
After that it's the end. I am so ashamed that life has beaten me.
Noone can tell me anything at this point to make me change my life.
I just need a woman to be my gf, to love me and find me sexually attractive.
Nothing else will do."	t5_2s3yz	True
