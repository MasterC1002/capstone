My girlfriend's birthday is coming up so I decided to make something special for her. I picked a picture of us two on the day that I asked her out and decided to replicate it in perler form. I decided not to melt the beads because I was never able to get a good consistency with that method. Instead I used the tape method and taped them all together and placed the finished product in a frame that I bought from the Hobby Lobby. Frame measures 22""x 28"" and the sprite portrait measures 21""x 23""

[Trim03](http://i.imgur.com/2IEUs)  These are among the worst, because you have to:
One cut off the excess.
Two: Orientate it so its not on the bottom of the pegboard.


[Off_center](http://i.imgur.com/euwes)  The bead on the left is Perler, notice the uniformity of the whole thing?  On the right side, however, all lopsided.  Simply horrid.


[Missing_holes01](http://i.imgur.com/fMIja)  [missing_holes02]  (http://i.imgur.com/pgM3L)  These gems here, take second place amongst the most annoying.  Let pictures speak for themselves on this one.


[Mutant](http://i.imgur.com/yaVTx)  [Muties](http://i.imgur.com/Pk0LA)  And the prize of crappiest walmart brand beads go to:  Mutants.  

What really bothers me is that the price you pay for a box of 8000 mixed bead with an assortment of small pegboards.  Is pretty much the same price you pay for the Perler brand.  Why on earth they decided to go with such low quality is anyones guess.  

Also, they sell the Perler brand on their website... go figure.  So do yourself a solid and stay away from the walmart brand beads, Melty Beads.

I'm sure most of us know this by now, but its worth a mention to anyone starting out.  Good luck.
