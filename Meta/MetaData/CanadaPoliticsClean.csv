1360171364.0	180as8	Do you agree with Canada's decision to ban the Westboro Baptist Church from entering the country?		237	26	269	"Edit: One of the reasons I asked is because I don't think its healthy for a government to be protecting people's feelings to such a degree. Its one thing if a person or group has a retarded message but I don't believe it should amount to time in prison (unless maybe there is another factor to it like trespassing, stalking, yelling in someone's face, etc.)   
  
If speech is so highly regulated, then I wonder if the lawmakers were a bunch of un-resilient tattletale's when they were kids.    
  
Banning non-terrorists from a nation really sucks for the reasons I pointed out. If Britain wants to ban ring wingers like Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, etc then they may as well cut their wrists over all the people in the world who have different beliefs and values. It must be even worse to be banned from Canada because geographically its so huge.  
**update**: not long ago I heard the theory that the WBC [might not even believe in what they preach](http://www.bringbackprivacy.com/2011/12/westboro-baptist-church-scam.html), and that lawsuits / publicity is what they're really all about. Just a theory that's unproven either way...  "	t5_2s4gt	True

Since my election I have been attempting to bring the Pirate Party into a more credible position within CanPoli including expanding our policy ( https://policy.pirateparty.ca ) and engaging more with people outside of our little circles.

Here is where I stood last time I took the political compass test: http://cl.ly/OzrC (this is similar to where most Pirates fall). 

To learn more about the ideology behind our party you can check out [The Pirate Wheel](http://falkvinge.net/pirate-wheel/)

Furthermore, I don't know how popular this AMA will be but at least in the beginning I am going to try to avoid going more than 2 levels into a thread.

I was elected Vice President of the LPCBC in November of 2011, and became President after the former President resigned.  I have been a member of the LPC since January of 2009, and have served on the LPCBC executive, in one form or another, since October of 2009.  I have worked on 5 campaigns since becoming active in politics in all 3 levels of government.

There are some questions I can't answer.  

As a Provincial/Territory Association President and member of the National Board of Directors, I am officially neutral in the upcoming Leadership contest.  While I am happy to talk about the process of selecting our next leader, I am unable to comment on specific candidates or speculate as to who may or may not win.

My position with the party is one of governance and administration, and I am not involved in crafting or communicating policy on behalf of the party.  I am happy to discuss the process of how the Liberal Party of Canada creates policy, but if you would like to discuss the specifics of party policy - past, present or future - I can try to get an MP or two to do an AMA in the future.

Other than that, Ask Me Anything!

---------------------------------------

Hi everyone. I am Pierre Moreau, Member of the Nationale Assembly for the riding of Châteauguay and former Minister of Transportation and of Canadian intergovernmental affairs. I am married and father of two wonderful girls.

I love to cook, ski, golf and scuba diving. I am running for the leadership of the Quebec Liberal Party because I want our members to be proud again to belong to this great party.

I understand tightening the spending belt and getting a little more fiscally responsible with our tax dollars, but is science and technology really the place to do so? As well, the government is favouring funding scientific projects and research that is economically beneficial to Canada (i.e. through development and market innovation) which means that there is a potential that certain projects related research strictly on the theoretical level could be denied government funding from the feds.

Thoughts on this?

Maybe they're just hiding their flairs, but even that strikes me as a bad thing. Admittedly, right now, it is not a great time to be a Conservative, but one of the objectives of this subreddit was to let all opinions be aired, and I don't feel that that's happening right now.

Even mods like /u/Palpz, who can still be seen moderating, don't seem to be as active as usual. So I ask you: why is that?

EDIT: I do not mean to come off as smug. I'm genuinely interested because I feel one of the valuable things about this subreddit is that it has encouraged cross-partisan discussion. While everyone doesn't see eye to eye all the time, I think that hearing other points of view is very important. For example, look at [Marc Harb's complaint](http://parl.gc.ca/Content/Sen/Chamber/411/Debates/163db_2013-05-21-e.htm#51) about the report indicating he is required to pay money back. There are definitely two sides to the expenses story (the Duffy-Wright affair is something different, of course), and while I don't mean to accuse anyone of anything, I think it's very valuable to have that other point of view to keep us all honest and ensure that our views (or my views, at least) do not become too tinted by the team-y nature of politics. The conservative and Conservative voices in this subreddit are extremely valuable, and I'm sad that I haven't seen them as much lately.

1370203792.0	1fjb6n	Why I want another Right of Centre political party	joe_canadian	87	18	131	"I’m a right of centre person, but I wouldn’t call myself a Conservative. Even though I’ve flirted with membership and volunteered for individual candidates both Federally and Provincially during election season (both are Red Tories, like myself), I now find myself in quandary. The longer the Conservatives have been in power, the less I like them. I’ll start with the highlights and why I continued to vote Conservative since I turned 18. 

Things started well with a minority government. As most of you know, I’m a firearms owner. The waiver of licence renewal fees was a boon to me. It was $60 less that I had to worry about spending. Now, the licence fees are back, and I’m ok with this. The government needs new revenue streams, and the licencing system is not free, and does the majority of heavy lifting for gun control. [It’s expected that this will ultimately bring in $18 million in revenue](http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/04/14/conservatives-bring-back-long-waived-gun-licence-fees-expect-18-million-in-revenue/). 

Next is the removal of the Firearms Registry. I was elated to see it go. It cost an estimated [$2 billion](http://www.garymauser.net/pdf/HubrisNorth.pdf) (PDF - pg. 1) by 2007, and [$66.4 million for the 2010-2011 fiscal year]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Firearms_Registry). In my own research (which, again, many of you have read), I’ve come to the conclusion that the registry was pretty damned useless. It was wasted money. If anyone wants to read my paper on the registry, I can send you a link to it. 

These were both issues that directly affected me. Joe Fiorito, a columnist with the Toronto Star, details his personal experience with the registry and letting his licence lapse – [1](http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2010/01/29/fiorito_the_cops_came_and_took_my_gun.html), [2](http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2010/02/01/fiorito_is_toronto_safer_without_my_bird_gun.html), [3](http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2010/03/22/fiorito_still_trying_to_get_my_bird_gun_back.html). I don’t know if he got his bird gun back, but I hope so. Yes, it's his fault for letting his licence lapse, but the heavyhandedness of the police could've turned things south pretty quickly. 

But in other situations, owners aren’t so lucky. [Owners of the Walther G22 or Armi-Jager AP80 had their rifles reclassified from non-restricted to prohibited by the RCMP](http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/01/10/government-to-gun-owners-we-made-a-mistake-fix-it-for-us-or-go-to-prison/). Owners has 30 days to turn over their firearms if they did not have a Prohibited-class licence, otherwise it’s up to 10 years in jail. There was no compensation for the reclassification. I’ll touch more on firearms later.

Now the bad. I’ll start with what irks me the most. Transparency. For a party that campaigned on being transparent and accountable, [Freedom of Information Act requests that are being replied to are at an all-time low](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2013/02/09/access-information-legault.html). I’d like to see an update to the FOIA to give Information and Privacy commissioners more power. Governments should not be able to hide behind closed doors. 

Omnibus Bills are our next stop. [For someone who hated omnibus bills back when the Liberals were in power](http://openparliament.ca/debates/1994/3/25/stephen-harper-1/only/), the Conservatives like them a little too much for my taste. I don’t like hypocrites. I really don’t like omnibus bills. Too many changes within dense legalese make it very difficult for the average person to keep track of what is being changed, how it’s being changed, and what the future effects may be. They also negate the ability of MPs to [represent their constituents](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/in-praise-of-stephen-harper-the-opposition-mp-who-fought-omnibus-bills/article5661305/). 

Closing of the Experimental Lakes Area. This is probably the most boneheaded move I’ve ever seen. The ELA is one of a kind, and its discoveries are used all over the world. I know that the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (a conservationist group) was [willing to take over administration in a Public/Private partnership](http://www.ofah.org/ofahcomments) (under “Experimental Lakes Area” – PDF). The OFAH has worked with both the DFO and Ontario’s MNR prior to this. I don’t believe this letter got a response. As much as I dislike the Ontario Liberals (that’s for another day), I hope they are able to take it over and competently manage the Area. But that would require supporting the Ministry of Natural Resources, [a department that has faced consistent budget cuts since ’90-’91](http://www.mindentimes.ca/2012/04/24/the-incredible-shrinking-mnr), and is losing [$70 million over the next three years](http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2012/06/28/ministry_of_natural_resources_job_cuts_office_closures_coming_province_says.html).

[No decriminalization of marijuana](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2011/11/25/bc-science-world.html). I’m not a smoker myself, but I know lots of people who do. Whatever happened to allowing people to make up their own mind on what to put into their bodies? Maybe I’m not supposed to understand this one. 

This doesn’t just go for the Government of Canada, but [stop deficit spending](http://opinion.financialpost.com/2013/05/16/beyond-our-means-government-debt-tops-1-2-trillion-and-spending-is-still-rising/). I know a good chunk of it is recession related. But I think it’s starting to go beyond reasonable. Something’s going to give down the road. It could be next year, it could be 20 years from now. Whatever happens is not going to be good (I’m looking at the [PIIGS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIGS_(economics\)) as a possibility). 

Another issue I’d like tackled. 

A proper definition for “safe storage of a firearm”. [Lorne Gunter](http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/02/01/lorne-gunter-canadas-laws-on-the-safe-storage-of-firearms-need-clarifying/) explains this better than I could. 

There’s more for all three sections…but my brain’s starting to hurt. I’ve looked at other parties closely, the only one matching anything close to what I’d like is the Liberals, and I’m playing wait and see for what Justin pulls out of his hat. I’m hoping that the Liberals focus less on the left and become a little more inclusive, but right now that’s just a hope. If another party were to come along that fills the void between the Liberals and Conservatives, I’d be a happy camper.

1346266868.0	z18cs	Can we have and honest and objective discussion about the negative aspects of the Harper Government?	proto_ziggy	68	6	94	"Given that we have recently covered the positive aspects of of the Harper Government in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaPolitics/comments/z00n7/what_good_things_has_the_harper_government_done/), it is a good time to compile the negative impacts as well. This way we can have a realistic and informed pro/con comparison rather than having to rely on information based on reactionary, and opinionated posts.


People obviously have some animosity towards our leader, and this is a great opportunity to either dispel some of the myths, or solidify legitimate issues.


Edit: That was informative and surprisingly civil. Thank you for all the insightful feedback. 

My two cents, for what it's worth, as well as being something that has yet to be mentioned in this thread: I feel that Stephen Harper has failed to not only engage Canada's youth in any capacity, but seems to be content with ignoring the populace in general (beyond tweeting merry Christmas).  As the leader of a modern democratic country, there is no excuse for this.

I know charisma and good PR are not mandatory traits for a Prime Minister, but in my opinion, a leader who fails to inspire his people, and give them goals and purpose, is not fulfilling their role. I would like to point out that President Obama is an inspirational leader with a clear vision that he has no problem communicating with the populace he governs. At this point, anything less than that is a failed opportunity.

**TL;DR:** Harper treats Canada like a large  business, rather than a country full of people with hopes and dreams. "	t5_2s4gt	True

Natural_RX	69	11	53	"[This editorial](http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/11/09/does-being-in-politics-mean-never-having-to-say-youre-sorry/) in the most recent edition of *Maclean's* talks about how they caused a huge stir with [their cover story from September 2010](http://i.thestar.com/images/23/45/3e446dea445c9fe4c35b3aeae66e.jpeg) calling out Quebec [as the most corrupt province in Canada](http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/09/24/the-most-corrupt-province/).

&gt; Quebec nationalists claimed our evidence was “hateful and defamatory.” Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe said we were “xenophobic.” A public letter from then premier Jean Charest argued we had met “none of the basic standards of journalism” and demanded we apologize to the entire province.
&gt; 
&gt; And in an extremely rare (as in once or twice every hundred years) move, the House of Commons unanimously passed a motion of censure against us, declaring ""this House . . . expresses its profound sadness at the prejudice displayed and the stereotypes employed by Maclean’s magazine to denigrate the Quebec nation, its history and its institutions.""

It's an obvious 'I told you so' piece. They even ridicule their parent company, Rogers, [for expressing 'regret' over the piece](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/rogers-expresses-regret-over-macleans-quebec-cover/article1214240/). Paul Wells goes as far as to [denounce MPs as being as 'wilfully blind as Montreal Mayor Gérald Tremblay](http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/11/09/isnt-it-time-to-wise-up-to-the-wise-guys/). Its definitely painting the negative reactions from 2010 as the avoidance of an inconvenient truth.

But something that strikes me is their suggestion that an apology is in order. I think whether they deserve it is rhetorical, but do you think it would ever be considered?"	t5_2s4gt	True

Today we got an email from the Globe's Chris Hannay that [they are launching a new Politics Insider section today](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/globe-politics-insider/introducing-the-globes-new-must-read-politics-insider/article9368422/). This new section is going to be subscriber only and, after testing [this new article for the section](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/globe-politics-insider/why-a-premier-dix-would-be-a-major-headache-for-harper/article9374767/) on multiple devices earlier this morning it would appear that the section will not have a social media exemption for websites like reddit.

We want to let users (particularly Globe subscribers) know that it would appear some content we regularly post (such as John Ibbitson articles) will be going behind the paywall and that anybody who wants to post that content should keep this information in mind.

Chris Hannay has also agreed to answer any questions you might have below."	t5_2s4gt	True

**edit- 1019 EST** Man, @pmharper is tweeting a storm!  Hitting the tweets before the media announces it

**edit- 1041 EST** Harper is just firing these suckas out.  I will sort these later in terms of importance of the ministeries (currently in order of release), and if I have time I will note what change, if any occurred.

**edit- 1052 EST** How many damned ministers does he need!
**edit- 1100 EST** OK, I think that just about covers everyone.

**In a 2010 interview conducted in French on TeleQuebec the following comments were made:** 

**""Canada isn't doing well right now because it's Albertans who control our community and socio-democratic agenda. It doesn't work,""**

**The interviewer than asks, ""Do you think Canada is better served when there are more Quebecers in charge than Albertans?""**

**To which Trudeau responds, ""I'm a Liberal, so of course I think so, yes.

I'd just like to contribute my two cents and maybe do a bit of a gentle reminder.  I'd like to remind everyone this subreddit disabled the ability to downvote with the CSS and has a ""no downvotes"" policy for a good reason, just as rule #2 is there for a good reason.

This [subreddit is left-leaning](http://i.imgur.com/jw50tgg.png).  Easily 60% of our userbase identifies as Liberal or NDP and less than a tenth as Conservative.  I am left-leaning myself, if my flair doesn't make that obvious.

There's nothing wrong with those numbers, but it does cause one problem -- Conservatives and conservatives and libertarians et. al. when they post are, in effect, posting against the hive mind.  It's the minority position.

When I'm downvoted, it discourages me from posting contrary to the hive mind in that subreddit in the future and often makes me feel embattled; when I feel embattled I write more aggressively. When you write, always try to realize where your interlocutor is coming from, and try to understand how they'll respond to your post. Try to keep the temperature down and the dialogue going!

If the minority opinion is downvoted, or if the minority voice is drowned out in a flood of scorn, those posters will rightly think ""well, what a bunch of assholes!"", and they will leave.

And then what? We'll have a nice echo chamber.

For the record, this isn't an official mod-post and I haven't run this by the other mods. It only reflects my view.  Except for the reminder to be civil and not downvote... you can consider that an official mod message.

(You might consider this post a bit of a spiritual successor to [""Conservatives, why have you gone quiet?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaPolitics/comments/1eu8av/conservatives_why_have_you_gone_quiet/) from a couple weeks ago.)"	t5_2s4gt	True

I have yet to find the video, but here is a transcript.  From what I understand SunMedia is attempting to remove this from the public sphere.   As a  broadcaster seeking mandatory carriage license, this content should be kept in the public sphere as a testament to the quality of material that comes from Sun Media.  Fine apologize for it.  But it is on the public record and it should stay there. 

**Transcript of Ezra Levant’s broadcast, “The Jew vs. The Gypsies”, broadcast on Sun News Network on September 5, 2012**
 
**Ezra Levant 00:00:02.98** 

On Friday, I told you about the wave of fraudulent refugee claims made by Gypsies trying to lie their way into Canada. That's lawbreaking in itself, lying about being refugees. I mean, they're coming from Hungary for crying out loud, a rich, generous, liberal democracy. No one's a refugee from Hungary, at least not since it was liberated from the Nazis and then from the Soviets. For more than 20 years, it's been free! 

But these are Gypsies! A culture synonymous with swindlers. The phrase 'Gypsy' and 'cheater' have been so interchangeable historically that the word has entered the English language as a verb: 'He gypped me.' Well, the Gypsies have gypped us! Too many have come here as false refugees. And they come here to gyp us again, to rob us blind, as they have done in Europe for centuries. 

Well, I warned you. On Friday I told you about this. Well today, in Durham Ontario, police revealed the depth of Gypsy crime in Canada that has accompanied this wave of fake refugees.  Ezra Levant 00:00:06.56 
Now let me stop before you blow your hate crime whistle at me for saying Gypsy or gypped. See, political correctness saying euphemisms like calling them Rrrrroma instead of Gypsy or, as the BBC calls them, Travellers, the point of that is to obscure the truth. 

But look at Gypsies! And one of the central characteristics of their culture, is that their chief economy is theft and begging -sorry, it's true. That's why so much political correctness has crept up around them, because it's an awful truth that we don't want to contemplate. 

Now I believe that anyone out there regardless of their race or their religion or their language or their place of birth, can choose to live a moral life. I must believe that! Because I believe that each of us was made in the image of God and that the whole challenge in life is to take responsibility for ourselves and make the right choices every day. 

**Ezra Levant 00:00:09.60** 

But Gypsies aren't a race, they aren't a religion, they aren't a linguistic group. They're the medieval prototype of the Occupy Wall Street movement, a shiftless group of hobos that doesn't believe in property rights for themselves - they're nomads - or for others, they rob people blind! 

Now the scourge has come to Canada through fake refugee claims, over 5,000 of them in the past five years, all from Hungary. The Canadian Border Services Agency estimates that just the paperwork and processing of these fake refugees costs almost a quarter billion dollars a year. And today, police in Ontario are taking to the courts more cases of the damage that they say they have found on the streets.   

**Ezra Levant 00:02:23.63** 

Look at this list of suspects released by Durham police - Gypsy after Gypsy after Gypsy - they gypped their way into Canada, and now they're gypping the rest of us. Look at this: Dinarca Caldaras - wanted for stealing two cars, money laundering, theft, fraud: Gypsy! But look at that, not on her own - as part of a criminal organization. We're used to biker gangs, we're used to the Hell's Angels or the Mafia. They're not races or religions, they're cultural groups, subcultures, deviant groups that choose to steal for a living. Look at this: Ovidiu Caldaras - criminal organization, fraud. It's not all non-violent, no way. As I told you on Friday, in Italy, Gypsies are charged with murder at least six times more frequently than their population would suggest. Here's Robert Caldaras - domestic assault, fraud, criminal organization. Hmmm. Caldaras, Caldaras, Caldaras.  It's almost as if they're family business, they're extended family, they're clan. Yeah, Gypsies. Claudiu Unguru - possession of stolen property, credit card fraud, four times for that, identity fraud, theft four times. Illie Paun - break and enter three times. It's not just for pocket change or trinkets, he's wanted on six counts of theft over five thousand bucks. Florentina Stoican - break and enter, multiple thefts.   

**Ezra Levant 00:02:34.73** 

Notice how many women there are on this list. Of course, it's not like the Hell's Angels or Mafia. There's no such thing as a woman as the boss of a biker gang or a woman as a godfather, but for Gypsies, it's a family affair. In fact, women and children are the best at it, because we liberal Canadians or Europeans would never suspect a child, or a mom, or both working together. Now don't worry, I won't show you all the suspects on this list - there are just too many. But every last one of them is a Gypsy. Just some of the 5,000 who have gained our system and are causing a made-in-Europe crime wave on our streets. Now to be clear, none of these folks have been convicted, and the accusations haven't yet been proved in court. That said, these charges are part of an extensive police operation involving multiple police forces. It seems to me, the cops have done their work on this one.   

**Ezra Levant 00:04:20.51** 

Durham Regional Police say that street Gypsies have four particular strategies: 

“Street distraction” - that's where a young girl will walk up to a citizen, maybe place a cheap, fake necklace around their neck, and then rip off the real, expensive necklace in the commotion. 

“Store distraction” is another one, going into a convenience store or a jewelry store with long dresses, distracting the workers and then robbing the place blind. 

“Shopper distraction” – that's where someone watches you enter your PIN at a store and then pickpocketing your wallet in the parking lot. 

And “family in need distraction”, pretending to be a poor, homeless family begging at the side of the road and then robbing you blind. 

Look, don't take it from me, take it from the men and women who have to fight this crime wave. Look. 

**police officer 00:05:00.94** 

""It's alleged that the ring would recruit individuals into Canada. Once in Canada they would claim refugee status, then apply for social assistance, primarily in the Toronto area. They would be brought into the distraction theft fraud operation and hand over any profits to the ringleaders. This investigation has identified over 400 persons associated to this organized crime ring.""  Ezra Levant 00:05:24.99 
Now just in case you're not clear about this, they're talkin' about Gypsies.   

**police officer 00:05:32.51**

 ""All the indications are that the 400 people we're aware of are Roma.""  

**Ezra Levant 00:05:40.41** 

Roma. Cops, you know, can be politically correct. Roma is the name of a kind of tomato, as you know. But it's what some people call Gypsies. You can call them whatever they like if they're arresting them. It's fine by me. Here's another clip.  police officer 00:05:46.91 
""We have arrested and charged 29 people and have warrants out for six more. The total charges to date add up to 263. This is the…""  

**Ezra Levant 00:05:58.71** 

Twenty-nine people, 263 charges that we know about so far. There are 5,000 of these Gypsies here. And it's an Access To Information from the government shows us this is on top of their welfare fraud. Here are four excerpts from that ATI document. 

Here's one. Quote, ""Twenty-four individuals out of a sample of 90 were found to be still collecting social assistance despite their scheduled removal date having already passed."" They were kicked out from Canada, still getting welfare back in Hungary! 

Here's another quote, ""These individuals appear to be well informed regarding Canada's refugee process and the associated financial assistance provided for all claimants awaiting a final determination. It can be inferred that these individuals are entering refugee claims for economic benefit."" Duh! 

Here's another one, ""Once in Canada, Hungarians are working together with other individuals within the community in the commission of serious offences. They are proving adept at manipulating Canadian systems to obtain the greatest possible benefit before returning to Hungary."" 

And finally, ""Both Border Services officers and intelligence officers have observed many of these Travellers leaving Canada with significant amounts of cash, credit cards, and oversized and additional luggage filled with items acquired in Canada such as toys, clothing, and laptops.  

**Ezra Levant 00:07:13.94** 

Look! So you've got refugee fraud. Then you've got fraud fraud - you know, stealing credit cards and laptops. Then you've got welfare fraud, even once they're kicked out! 

They're gypping us! Sorry, that's a word for a reason -- they're thieves! 

And women and children, their own wives and kids, are the main tools of this. 

Remember what I told you on Friday. In Milan, Italy, 50 Gypsy children each stole 12,000 euros a month! And Italian police could do nothing since they were all young kids. Stealing is part of their family crime organization.

**Ezra Levant 00:07:43.41** 

Being Gypsy isn't like being Black, or being gay, or being a woman, or even Romanian, where many Gypsies come from - just like being from Sicily doesn't make you part of the Mafia. Being Gypsy is a positive choice. Like being a Blood or a Crip. Like joining the Cosa Nostra. 

For centuries these roving highway gangs have mocked the law and robbed their way across Europe. 

And now, because of our broken refugee system, they're here in Canada by the thousand, and they've brought a Gypsy crime wave with them.  

**Ezra Levant 00:08:14.58** 

Yeah. No thanks. I'm not interested in calling them Roma, or Travellers, or having a Human Rights Commission investigate what we as a society have done them wrong and maybe dispatching social workers to them. 

Hah! The social workers will just have their wallets stolen. 

I want to dispatch cops, and send the bad Gypsies back to Hungary on the next plane. 

Just warn the flight attendants, heh, to not wear any jewelry on the flight?

This is the subject of a controversial post made and removed in this sub earlier today. Each of the 5 goals in this pamphlet are sort of wordy and vague, so let's try to actually summarize them in specific layman's terms, to get a short list of clear goals for the protests. I don't mean for the following to be offensive, and if you have corrections then please expand on them.

1. The government needs to apologize for ""the full range of colonial institutions"", which I assume means basically every level of government in Canada?

2. The government needs to enact legislation which exempts First Nations from all laws of Canada, while allowing First Nations to create their own set of laws

3. The government must give up all levels of control over First Nations economies, educational systems, housing, leadership, land, etc. (This would follow automatically if #2 was granted tough, right?)

4. The government must completely fund whatever laws and policies are enacted by the First Nations people

5. The government must give First Nations rights to negotiate on everything. (If they are demanding veto rights, then they're effectively removing the government's ability to negotiate on anything, since they'd be able to demand any changes or they'll reject it. So they would need to actually be specific about what these negotiations should entail)

So which of these is incorrect or misleading?

1342450336.0	wn8tn	A reminder about downvotes	bunglejerry	66	28	49	"The number of subscribers to this subreddit has increased dramatically recently, and while we welcome the opportunity to discuss politics with a larger number and wider range of people, it seems like a good opportunity to inform new users, and remind older ones, about our downvote policy.

The reason a huge red banner appears when you hover over the downvote button is because we are trying very hard to discourage its misuse. The basic rules of rediquette, which exist throughout reddit, are more important in a political forum than in others. When upvoting and downvoting is used to agree or disagree with a person's political opinions, the end result is to silence dissent and to turn this subreddit into a one-sided sounding board. This has been the fate of a *large number* of subreddits, and we don't want /r/canadapolitics to go the same route.

So again: please base your decision to downvote on *whether the comment contributes to the discussion or violates the subreddit's rules*, not on whether it agrees with your own personal views or not. We're hoping to minimize the use of downvotes here, so in the event you do downvote someone, please *explain why*.

Keeping the tone of this subreddit is a community effort, one we must all be involved in. One way to do so is to think carefully about why you're downvoting and not to abuse the downvote button.

Thanks."	t5_2s4gt	True

1359412370.0	17gfnx	Sundry announcements and a request for feedback	h1ppophagist	42	4	100	"Greetings to all from the mods of /r/CanadaPolitics. 

First off, we're proud to announce ~~three~~ *four* (go dmcg12!) great upcoming AMAs: ~~two~~ three with Liberal Party of Canada leadership candidates, including Marc Garneau, and a fourth with Jane Sterk, leader of the Green Party of British Columbia. We're all really excited to be hosting such interesting people here.

In the month of December, /r/CanadaPolitics quietly passed two milestones: the subreddit celebrated its first birthday and received its 5,000th subscriber. Both of these are things to be proud of, and both of them offer us an opportunity to look back at where our subreddit has been and look ahead to where all of us think it should be going.

Here is an imgur album with a few graphs and charts of our subreddit in 2012: http://imgur.com/a/sfBuq

As impressive as our growth has been, what is more impressive is how we've been able to keep our conversations here productive, civil, respectful and enjoyable - in spite of the tendency of subreddits to become one-sided 'echo chambers'. We, the moderating team, are happy to do our part in maintaining this, but really it's the commitment to user moderation that our best and most cherished users have that makes the difference: the application of a simple set of submission guidelines, written before this subreddit had even 500 subscribers and still effective with a userbase ten times that amount.

It's everybody's hope that (a) the subreddit will continue to grow, and (b) this growth will not come at the expense of civil discussion here. To that end, we'd really appreciate some open and candid discussion of our submission guidelines and of our moderation practices. The fact that we've been accused in equal measure of having a left-wing bias and of having a right-wing bias must mean, in a strange way, that we're doing something right. Yet we're certainly fallible and acknowledge that there might be faults in our moderation approach - faults that we'd appreciate your calling to our attention. So let us know: what do you think of the moderation practices here? Is there anything that you think should be done differently? We'd love to hear your thoughts. 
 
The other thing we'd like your help with is generating new content. To that end, we're eager to hear your ideas on two different topics:

First, AMAs. So far, we've been honoured to hold AMAs from a variety of people in the Canadian political arena, but we'd really appreciate any ideas anyone here might have for future AMA guests, or - even better - leads on how to reach these people.

Second, we have a new idea regarding self-posts. Self-posts are often among our favourite and most popular posts here, so we'd like to encourage them. We're considering an idea called 'resolutions', where users make self-posts featuring 'resolutions', much like bills put to parliament, that we could then discuss in the comments. An example might be something like the following: ""Be it resolved that, upon the death of Her Majesty Elizabeth II or her abdication from the throne, the position of head of state be taken by a Canadian-born Canadian citizen either elected or appointed to the role for a term lasting no more than five years."" We'd love to hear your feedback about this idea and, if it's well received, get one started as soon as possible.

5,000 subscribers is pretty small potatoes in the grand scheme of reddit, but /r/CanadaPolitics is a community that punches above its weight, both in terms of volume of content and in terms of how far and wide we get noticed. Hopefully we'll keep growing at this same pace, but further growth offers new opportunities and new risks in equal measure. Here's hoping everyone's committed to keeping the tone we all value so much here, and here's hoping everyone's on the same page about how to best do that. As moderators, we are proud and honoured to have 5,000 of reddit's best users grace our pages here. It's you who make this such a great little corner of reddit.

Thanks!

**TL;DR** courtesy of bunglejerry: (a) How are we doing as mods? (b) Any ideas or leads for AMAs? (c) Here's an idea to spur self-posts. (d) Aw gosh we wuv you."	t5_2s4gt	True

But my entire family is from the prairies, and they despise the NDP (federally) I quote ""The NPD would destroy the country!""

Now I understand that I am asking opinions and not facts so I'm not asking for proof (though it would be awesome if there is past NDP screw-up to support your beliefs)

So in short, why do some people hate the NDP federally and believe them unfit to run the country?  They have never been elected so how can you know they are unfit to run the country?  Why this rampant hate from some people?

edit/updates:

Thanks folks so it's mostly screw up in the provincial side that I think made my family angry to it, and since my relatives were a public service worker in Ontario they probably got hit with that 3 weeks off thingy by Bob Rae.  "	t5_2s4gt	True

The survey is of moderate length (~10mins), and asks you a number of questions about four party leaders (CPC, LPC, NDP, Green). It also asks about your political preferences and views. I'd very much appreciate your input! You can participate by clicking the link below:

https://wlupsychology.co1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_cAOfvYD1q0PJcWh

A full description of what is in the survey is on the first page.

Once I collect all the data from this community (and r/Canada), I'll write up the descriptives and general findings and post them for everyone.

Note: I realize that reddit tends to be a left-leaning community, and will hopefully balance that out in a few different ways. Doesn't mean your opinions aren't important :)

I got a reply from a volunteer and thought I'd share it for the sake of discussion.	LABIA_LISP	42	7	29	"Hi -----,
 
Thanks for your email.  My name ----- and I'm a volunteer who is helping Marc run for the leadership of the Liberal Party. We appreciate your well-though out email.  In terms of our Internet service, its a complex issue, but one that Marc has long been talking about:
 
http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/make-high-speed-internet-basic-service-crtc-urged/article1241470/
 
Marc would like to see a wide-scale broadband policy implemented, but he realizes that any impetus for this will have to come from the government, as private industry doesn't see this as a revenue source.  Perhaps by opening up telecommunications to outside competition, (maybe European or American telecommunications companies) then a public-private partnership may be possible.  As Marc has repeatedly said, if we want to grow the knowledge economy then we have to make strategic investments in the infrastructure that supports that economy. 
 
I wish that we could have a completely costed out package ready for you, but I know that if Marc should have the privileged of becoming the next Liberal leader, telecommunications ""reform"" will definitely be on the agenda. In the meantime, fire me off your ideas...we'd love to hear them!
 
Also, just a reminder that the cut-off date to register as a supporter  is Sunday, March 3rd! If you haven’t registered, I encourage you to do so at https://marcgarneau.ca/supporter/
 
If you are signed up as a supporter already, or are currently a Liberal member, the other deadline is to register to vote is Thursday, March 14th.  You should have received a registration notice from the Liberal Party by now...if you haven’t, fire them off an email at  info@liberal.ca
 
Once again, thanks for your email!
 
All the best,
 
------

I'll start: the Conservative Party of Canada has shown a marked ability to adapt itself when it finds its positions out of public favour - I'm thinking primarily abortion, gay rights and inclusion of new Canadians in the political process. It's easy to say ""I remember a less tolerant CPC"", but the evidence at hand is that they're happy to keep the intolerant opinions far from the limelight.

Liberals have an appreciation for technocracy that is admirable. I'd bet the average Liberal candidate for public office has a more impressive resume than the average Tory or NDP candidate, and the Liberal caucus seems devoid of quacks and nutbars.

Greens have, so far, shown an impressive tendency to take the higher road and avoid mud-slinging hyperpartisanship, and I think that's admirable. I also love their commitment to electoral reform.

1370399167.0	1fp1tj	On an elected Senate	exasperation	40	5	68	"Aside from abolition, the most common call for reform with the Senate is for it to be elected in some way.  This post isn't about the nature of how the Senate would be elected, but the consequences of such a reform.  Often the proposal to elect the Senate comes with the proposal of more power for the Senate.

My thoughts:

* An elected Senate will probably want more power. Senators will seek office and will want power to go with it.  This could come in the form of exercising their veto more frequently, and legislation originating from the Senate more often.

* Potentially, it could result in cabinet positions being held by Senators. It was common for Lords to have cabinet positions in the UK until the late 19th century and a number senators were indeed members of the cabinet in Canada in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Sir Mackenzie Bowell and Sir John Abbott were both Prime Minister in the late 19th century while Senators.

  This could radically alter the balance of power in Parliament and change the nature of government in Canada in ways we can't predict. In practice today, Ministers are directly responsible to the Commons, as they all sit in the Commons.  What would the consequences be if the leader of the official opposition is not sitting in the same house as the Minister of Industry?

* If the Senate becomes subject to electoral politics, I think we run the risk of a deadlock scenario if different parties dominate the House and Senate.

   I think Australia is probably our best reference model for what would happen with a strong, elected upper chamber, as most of the other Westminster democracies are either unicameral (such as New Zealand) or have a weak upper house (UK, Canada, etc.).

   Australia elects both its upper and lower chamber. At several points in Australian history, the houses have had majorities of different parties that were incapable of reaching compromise to pass any bills, including budgets. This sort of impasse led to the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis when the Australian legislature was incapable of passing any bills and government services were looking at a complete defunding.  The Governor-General dismissed the lower house and called an election. Without careful design, that could happen here with a stronger Senate.

What are your thoughts on the consequences of an elected Senate?"	t5_2s4gt	True

So AMAs haven't been happening as often lately. Part of that is me contacting less people due to having less time among other things. More are in the pipe trying to find a date and such. As always feel free to suggest new AMA candidates

That said, we have another AMA on Tuesday! It's at a different time due to scheduling constraints, but we will have National Post's John Ivison visiting us Tuesday at 11am (hence the mod post since it is relatively soon).

Thanks,
