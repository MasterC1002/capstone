1366330047.0	1cn759	Anyone see a yellow pontiac solstice getting rammed by a truck on 24E (it was my father, need help)	lookingforsomevidene	451	39	35	"Need help from whoever has video of it!!

My father was coming home from work today at around 6:30pm going east on rt-24 in his yellow Pontiac Solstice (tiny little sports car). It was stop and go traffic and a large flat-bed truck with large wire coils on it started repeated ramming my father's car. The truck driver would let space build, rev-up, then ram him, over and over again. My father has no idea who it was or why but it was violent and he was honestly scared for his life.  

He managed to get behind the truck eventually and followed him while calling police. The truck pulled over farther down 24 so my father pulled behind it but kept a distance. The man got out of the truck and started walking to my fathers car. Not knowing if he had a weapon or what the man was about to do he pulled around the truck and stopped a distance in front. The man got back in the truck and started driving at him so my father drove away before the truck could hit him at a higher speed. Eventually my father found a NJ trooper who radioed ahead where I believe they pulled him over.

My father said he saw people video taping the incident on their phones (this wasn't a fender bender, this guy was on a mission and my father was the target for some unknown reason). So if this does go to court or what not it would be a **HUGE** help to have that video.

Please up-vote for exposure (it's a throw away, I don't want karma)... I know someone or someone has the video. My whole family is real shaken up but we're happy he is ok."	t5_2qhsu	True

I’m a 25f college grad looking for a room for rent in Morristown (or a nearby area) OR people to rent a place with. I need something ASAP. My price range is up to $1,200/month but I’d obviously like to keep it less than that if possible.

I have a 15 year old kitty that would have to come with me, we’re kind of a package deal. We do, however, include a HUGE flat screen TV, an awesome movie collection, a comfy couch, and a decent book collection as well.

flip light switches walking into rooms.  Having a blanket nailed to
the open doorway to trap the heat seems normal.  I don't miss the
street light that would shine in my eyes when trying to sleep at
night. I no longer run the tap, letting the water get cold. It is
always cold. Ice cold.  Dishes pile up in the sink.   There a signs of
life.  Cars pass in the night, the music too loud.  I should be
irritated. I am not. I miss music.  A neighbor has power.  A 100 foot
extension cord gives me enough power for internet. The quiet is
oppressive.  Oppression becomes preferable, as the street is ripped up
by jackhammers in search of a natural gas leak. My car is out of gas.
I scout on bicycle.  I pass a power strip hanging to the street from a
4th story window.  A note offers strangers power for their cell
phones. I am grateful.  Another scouting run reveals lines have
receded at gas stations.  I fill up.  I buy 2 snickers bars.
Breakfast.  With the added range of a car, I expand my search for
candles. I am now a candle expert. I repair wicks and manage wax.  I
never imagined I would be so excited to find candles at target. I
spend $120 on candles.  The gym has reopened. I go for hot showers.  I
consider working out. I do not. Nearby friends try to convince me to
stay with them.  It's below freezing at night, they say. I scowl at
their softness.  I'm grew up in the frozen Minnesota tundra.  I survive. I endure. I AM LEGEND

Her father, who was taking care of her had a stroke. She doesn't have many friends. She has been begging people to come see her on facebook. I can't go because I have no one to watch my kids. Her posts are breaking my heart. Any NJ folk who are interested in maybe a little hour or two with a dying woman? PM me. Thanks.

EDIT: Should have clarified, I live in Utah and would need to find someone for many days or a week to watch the kids.  

EDIT 2: Thank you so much for the responses.  I am waiting for information from her about how much she can handle and when would be a good time.  I am rushing out the door to work and will get back to all you awesome New Jerseyians as soon as I can. 

EDIT 3: Still haven't heard back from her. I think she had specialists this morning.  Quite frankly I am blown away the response.  You are all awesome.  She is at St. Peter's University Hospital.  I've found a hospice there that might be able to help also. 

EDIT 4: Someone in her family (an aunt) has contacted me and they are flying out there right now to take care of her and be there with her.  They found out about it on my facebook page, many people shared my post and  she was a friend of a friend of a friend.  She hasn't spoken to any of them in over 20 years and didn't tell them she was even sick.  I told the aunt about this page and sent her the link so she might be contacting some of you for support.  Even though no visits came of this out post, I am really amazing that so many people are willing to give up their time for a complete stranger.  I am going to find out if cards or something would cheer her up.  New Jersey people are great.  If I was rich I would buy reddit gold for all of you. "	t5_2qhsu	True

The fatal accident happened at 11:30 p.m. in the area of mile marker 30.1 eastbound. State Police say 22-year-old Jonathan Schifferdecker of Cape May Court House drove his Chevy Malibu into the back of a tanker truck. The impact caused his car to become engulfed in flames and Schifferdecker died at the scene.


Another accident happened at 8:48 p.m. near mile marker 29.9 eastbound. That's where State Police say a 9-year-old boy was flown from the scene after the car he was riding in struck the concrete median. Authorities say a person who witnessed the accident had gotten out of their vehicle to check on the victims, but was struck an oncoming car. He is listed in serious condition at Cooper University Hospital. The boy's condition is unknown at this time.


There was also a minor accident around the same time near the same mile marker on the westbound side of the expressway. No injuries were reported.

Hi all,

I'm the nightlife coordinator for Caesars Entertainment in AC and I can actually set up a lot for us, comped bottles, free admission, roped off section, etc.

Just let me know a day that would be good for you guys and I'll set up the rest. I just request that it be either a Wednesday, Friday, or Saturday. (just not next Wednesday, we have PSY performing at The Pool and it's going to be hell and a half)


UPDATE:
Wow, awesome response from you guys! It seems that the consensus is for a Saturday (so far most have voted for December 15th) if it does happen on a Saturday I'll set it up at Foundation Room in Showboat, we will also get private rooms in the club to party in. 
THIS DATE &amp; LOCATION ARE NOT A DEFINITE YET.

If we do a Wednesday or a Friday I can set it up at The Pool after Dark at Harrahs if you guys would prefer that.

FAQs:
Anything for 18+?

 I suggest we have a pregame party (in a suite if anyone wants to spring for one) and/or a dinner so the underage redditors can join in the fun

Anything for rooms? 

Yes I can get Reduced rate rooms, Ill have more info when we can get a definite date. 

What if I can't make this date? 

I'll plan more meet ups! Also anytime you guys come to AC feel free to message me and I can offer help where I can!

What if I'm not from NJ?

The more the merrier! Unless youre a crab-person. Crab people are not welcome.

Also a redditor ( u/whatthefuckman ) was kind enough to make a meet up page http://www.meetup.com/NJReddit/events/93232772/?a=socialmedia

**********UPDATE 2:***********

If we do Friday (12/14): 

LOCATION: The Pool after Dark

REDUCED ROOM RATES: $129

COMPS: FREE ADMISSION TIL 12, 4 BOTTLES (2 Gratuity Free, if this is the case I'll pay for the gratuity for 2 more bottles so all 4 will be completely free)

DINNER: Dos Caminos or Bills Burger Bar


If we do it Saturday (12/15):

**[Public Statement from the NWS, please read](http://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=NWS&amp;issuedby=PHI&amp;product=PNS&amp;format=CI&amp;version=1&amp;glossary=0)**

I will try to update twice a day as I get confirmations from the NWS and NHC at NOAA. We should get a checklist of things to make sure everyone has ready just in case (specifically for NJ, not on the ready.gov site). What's going on? Cold air from a cold front, then the jet stream, and the hurricane itself makes it a hybrid storm... which is much more dangerous. Do not pay attention to the category of the storm, as it will be more intense than the category lets on. The reports are saying it is very slow moving and could last for days. Sunday/Monday is projected to be when Hurricane Shitstorm hits. I will update as new info comes in.


**UPDATE 11PM EST SATURDAY 27th** [NHC](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/storm_graphics/AT18/refresh/AL1812W_NL+gif/153841W_NL_sm.gif) models are showing a *direct hit over SOUTHERN NJ/DELAWARE this coming [TUESDAY/WEDNESDAY](http://cdn.abclocal.go.com/images/wpvi/cms_exf_2007/weather/8862348_600x338.jpg)*. Get ready. Better safe than sorry. Be sure to check in on your elderly neighbors as well!!! The Washington Post's Weather Gang [has commentary](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/experts-sound-alarm-on-hurricane-sandy-drawing-comparisons-to-2001-perfect-storm/2012/10/25/f25a81fc-1ed7-11e2-9cd5-b55c38388962_blog.html) you should read as to why this isn't your typical storm. I like how the NWS put this in their forecast... **INTERESTS ARE REMINDED NOT TO FOCUS ON THE EXACT TRACK OF THIS SYSTEM SINCE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS WILL EXTEND WELL AWAY FROM THE LOCATION OF THE CENTER** it's not a small storm. It will impact you, regardless of where you are in the state. 

[HERE](http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/zoom/Rainfall_Days_1-5.gif) is the expected total rainfall over the next few days. Better get your boats out, folks. 

[LIVE Police, EMS, Fire, Rail radio scanners online](http://www.radioreference.com/apps/audio/) who I believe has an app.

The American Red Cross does not have a list of shelters available yet. When this is ready, I will post ASAP. As other redditors have posted below, we might need to coordinate redditor to redditor shelter accommodations. Especially if they have pets

It's an extra-tropical cyclone. It's kind of a mix between a nor'easter and a hurricane, making it twice the fun! ALSO, add in a dash of astronomically high tides (I can personally attest to this from the flooding around here lately with NO rain), and you're in for a lot of flooding. They're calling for up to 10 inches of rain in a best case scenario. DO NOT FUCK AROUND. See a flooded road? DONT DRIVE THROUGH IT. 

Shore faring folks that might/will probably get evacuated, meet up with people in this thread for places to stay. Swap emergency supplies and make sure you have an emergency plan in place. Your local office of emergency management will be of much help. 

**PLEASE BE SURE TO BRING ALL PROJECTILES INSIDE!!** Turn your tables upside down (trick I learned last year), stack your chairs and TIE THEM DOWN to something. [Use a good knot](http://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1216i5/hurricane_sandy_prep_thread/c6s1fht). I know you decorated all cute for halloween and shit, but it's no fun when your display is four blocks over.

If this is a major event, we will update accordingly. This thread is precautionary only. Let's make sure we keep things tight and safe within our community!

Here are things to do the day before (Please comment to add more if I missed some)

* **This is the time to turn your refrigerator to the highest setting.** If the power goes out your fridge will stay colder longer. Also its a good time to take out shit that does not need to be in there and to reorganize food in types of priority. Things that spoil should be in the front to minimize the time the door is open.

* Do the dishes. If the water goes out you will have dirty dishing smelling up the place.

* I am also freezing water in plastic containers in the freezer to fill in empty space with ice in case the power goes out.

* Recharge/fill your rechargeable batteries.

* Do your laundry, if the power or water goes out (remember Irene knocked out water pumps for a week in places). No one wants to wear smelly clothing.

* Clean out your bathtub and fill it with water. Make sure the seal is good so it does not leak out in case the water is out for a while. This will be for toilet flushing in case the water does not work. All you need is a bucket and you pour it down the toilet for it to flush. Also this could be your last resort drinking water.

* Gather all flashlights and or candles in one place that is easy to access and you can locate in the dark. Place the batteries there as well as lighters/matches. Also place the first aid kit/ radio there if you have one.

* Place all tools you think you will need i.e. Power tools/ chainsaws in one localized place. Place gas tanks tied down and secured outside. Its really unwise to place full gas tanks indoors and in a non ventilated place.

* If you have a generator, make sure to turn it on to see if it will run. Get oil if you need it, if you have a chainsaw make sure you have oil for that as well.

* Check your smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarm batteries. If the power goes out and you need to use candles, a fire place, or a generator this is a must.

* If you don't know where your water/gas/ and electricity shut off is, this is a good time to find out. If you have to evacuate please shut off the gas and electric as it might save your house or a person who might get electrocuted. The gas shut off should look like a lever coming from the concrete floor of a black pipe, **not a copper pipe** The electric shutoff is the big breaker switch at the top of the circuit breaker.

* If you have a detached garage, you might want to ""release"" the garage door off the automatic gate if you do not have a battery back up automatic gate. This is because if the power goes off it is essentially locked in the close position.

* Put all medication in an easy to find area.

* start filling big pots with water for cooking and or heating. If your electric goes out, you most likely will not have hot water or heating as they need electricity to turn on and operate. What does work most likely is your stove. Boil water. Make sure you have matches or a lighter as your electric ignitor will not work, If you have a newer oven it most likely will not work as well.

Please comment to add more tips

* **edit more stuff, cash is king during an flood/outage. ATMs and credit cards will not work if the power or internet is out. Go to the bank and withdraw some money now.**

* **Remember gas stations need electricity to pump gas, no electricity no gas to car even if the station has gas in their storage tanks. Go get some gas now**

* Have some duct tape and garbage bags ready in case one of your windows get smashed by debris.

* As per Huludfan82 and yesmydog, if you have not done so now, take in anything that will be blown away

* As per jeffrife, Anchor top-heavy objects as well, like your grill

* As per Teknishun, If you have large empty spaces in your refrigerator/freezer fill them with bottled water. Don't pack your spaces tight, but this added thermal capacity will keep the refrigerator colder longer and the ones in the freezer can be moved to the refrigerator if needed.

* As per orange386, radio set to 101.5 for the power outage. Clean garbage cans are filled with hose water for flushing and washing stuff. Wet wipes, rubbing alcohol, LED lamps... check. Will regularly go out to the buffet to eat at least 2-3 meals worth. Come at me Sandy.

I was living in Colorado for a bit, and out there you just cannot find a ""pizzeria.""  It's all Dominos and Blackjack.  And always so dry.  They used to include ranch dressing with every pizza.  Because the people out there actually would dip their pizza in ranch dressing.

When I tried to explain to my friends what NJ pizza was like, the best I could come up with was Sbarro's.  And they said ""oh, mall pizza.""  And I sadly sighed and said yes, but a thousand times better.

Anyway... I call Blackjack one night to order delivery.  And I say ""I'll take one large pie.""  And I swear to god, the voice on the other side of the line says, in the most southern accent you can imagine: ""we don't sell pie.""

For a quick second, I had no idea what to say.  Then I said ""I want a large pizza.  A large pizza pie.""  And that was that.  And then I laughed my ass off.  "	t5_2qhsu	True

This one seems to be affecting Southwest NJ/Central NJ/Northwest NJ the most. The NYC Metro Area should be spared the worst of the snow. 

Coastal areas, including the bay areas, should keep an eye on the tides. High tide this afternoon will be around 2-3PM and could be a problem for many. Winds will be gusting hard with expected tides of 7-8 feet above Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) and 2-3 feet above normal astronomical tide. Delaware Bay high tide around 6pm 3/6/13


**Even if this is just a rain event for you, the bulk of the State will be seeing EXTREMELY high wind gusts up to 60mph**



This is a tricky forecast, according to WCBS 880 meteorologist Craig Allen, who wrote the following on his Facebook page earlier: ""I'll just say this for now - in 2 days this has 'de-volved' into one of the hardest winter forecasts in years. **There is very high potential for a complete bust in at least 50% of the area in terms of rain vs snow and amounts.**""

I hope nobody else gets into this mess like a few of us did.  BEWARE!



I just paid $533 to have the dealership dump my tank because Raceway had filled my car with contaminated fuel. Linked is a picture of a gatorade bottle with fuel on the top, and water underneath. There must have been a leak somewhere in their fuel lines because it was pouring all of yesterday.  When I went to pick up the car from the service center, turns out two other cars were being serviced for the exact same problem--engine stuttering and stalling due to water in the fuel tank.  Their gas station? Raceway

This summer I'm doing a Camp America-style programme, which consists of 8 weeks working at a summer camp in Maine, before being let loose to travel in mid August. Never been to the US before, so really looking forward to it! I got an incredibly friendly response from /r/Maine when asking about how to start so thought I'd see what the other states I'll be visiting have to offer too.

Since I'll no doubt be going though New Jersey on my way down the East Coast, I was wondering if I could get any advice from you guys about what I absolutely cannot miss in your state? Anything local to you that's off the beaten track? Also, I was wondering if anyone could recommend anywhere cheap to stay, since I'm a 21 year old student so will be doing this on an extremely tight budget! Even something like a nod in the direction of your favourite local place to eat would be greatly appreciated.

So yeah, I'd be grateful for any tips or advice you have to offer.

**Edit:** Would also really appreciate if you could upvote this, to give me a better chance of getting replies!

**EDIT 2: Holy shit, you guys are incredibly friendly.** Thank you all so much, I'll do my best to reply to you all, I really appreciate all your comments. Judging by all the responses here and the PMs I got, I think I'm going to enjoy your state!"	t5_2qhsu	True

I think this tread could become a resource for people all over the state, so if you have any links or personal suggestions as to where to check this out post it!

These links are from this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1c809e/good_chance_for_us_to_see_the_northern_lights/

WorldTravelBucket: I actually traveled to Finland in January to hunt the Northern Lights and can answer any questions people may have.
In the meantime, two sites you want to keep an eye on as it gets closer are the following:
http://helios.swpc.noaa.gov/ovation/ - This site provides a map of where the Northern Lights will most likely be visible at the current time. Since the Northern Lights are so difficult to forecast and project, it is only a guideline of what to expect.
http://www.gi.alaska.edu/auroraforecast - The conditions change with little/no notice. Go to this site and select the short-term forecast to see what the conditions are like.
You absolutely want to head to areas with no light pollution (think Pine Barrens, Delaware Water Gap, etc. If anyone has questions, please let me know!

1351688859.0	12ea0x	Last night I was a accused of burglarizing my own home. A police officer knocked me down and entered my home without consent. 	Burglerthrowaway	71	9	69	"I just wanna know what I can do here. Last night around 7pm I came home after eating at a restaurant with my girlfriend and 18 year old cousin. My parents, aunt, and gma stayed at the restaurant. My cousin and I stepped out my side door to the alley that leads to my backyard to smoke a cigarette. I live in North Bergen so the houses are really close together. While we were smoking a cig the person that lives across the yard apparently called the cops and said we were trying to break in. We looked young (I am 25) and wore hoodies (it's cold) and of course there was no power so it was all dark. 

We went back inside my house when a few minutes later I hear radios and see flashlights outside. I stepped out my side door again and saw a police officer and said to him, ""hey whats going on"" Or something like that. He said to come down and show me ID. I told him I didn't have shoes on so I didn't wanna come outside, but I yelled for my gf to get our IDs. At this point the officer tries to enter my house to which I replied ""sorry but you do not have consent to enter my home"". Well he pushed me back from the door, knocked me down and said ""you don't fucking tell me what to do, this is how I fucking roll"". Exact words. 

Then about 8-10 officers entered my home and sweeped it. At this point were all freaking out not knowing what's going on. Within 30 seconds of them entered we had presented IDs which proved we lived there. The police continued to have an aggressive demeanor with us telling us to shut the fuck up, be quiet, etc. We were freaking out but I never once cussed or refused to comply. One officer even told me that if I kept talking he would take me to jail for disorderly conduct... In my own home, really?

After the lieutenant got all the info he left with everyone. The whole thing only took about 5-10 minutes so it was very fast and left us kinda shocked. I only got 2 badge #s and there was so many cops there all talking shit to us that it's hard to say who said what. I've already filed a complaint with my cousin and my gf is going with me to file one later.

On Saturday, October 27, sometime between 9am &amp; noon, my 3 month old male bicolored (medium length white hair with black spots) cat named Leo went missing. He has green eyes and weighs ~2.5 pounds. He is not spayed yet and unfortunately he was not wearing his collar on the morning he went missing. So far I have posted these [flyers](http://eden.rutgers.edu/~joshbran/flyer.html) all around my home in New Brunswick and have contacted all the local animal shelters informing them of his recent disappearance.

I realize this is a long shot, but if anyone has any information regarding his recent whereabouts, I have made a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/LeoTheMissingCat) to help spread the word.

With hurricane Sandy forcing New Brunswick to basically shutdown for the next two days, I am extremely worried about his safety if he was not already rescued.

I would be eternally grateful if you guys could upvote this thread or atleast share &amp; like his [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/LeoTheMissingCat) to help me spread the word throughout my community."	t5_2qhsu	True

I was just arrested for possession of someone else's marijuana because it was in a house I ""live in""."	jerseyfresh	85	23	63	"I'm posting this because it has suddenly occurred to me how ridiculous these laws against marijuana are, and I think we need to do something. Let me tell you what happened:

4 hours ago I hear a knock at my door and it's the police. I go out on the porch to speak with them, and they tell me they have a warrant for my sister's boyfriend (who has been staying with us). He was not here at the time and the officers were about to leave when the one officer caught a glimpse of something through the window: a small glass bong similar to those used for smoking marijuana. Despite my objections to come in the house, he cited the ""plain sight rule"" and went inside. Once inside he found a small amount of what appeared to be marijuana stems and dried marijuana. He said because I was the ""home owner"" and the only one there, I would have to take responsibility for it. He said it was my duty to report illegal drugs if they were in my house and they didn't belong to me. I failed to do that apparently, and was taken into custody where I was processed and released. I am shocked, especially because I don't even smoke marijuana. 

But even if it was mine, so what? What harm was I posing to anyone? None. Why can't an adult, in the privacy of his own home, at 10pm, smoke a joint? Why is it classified as being more dangerous than cocaine? When are we going to stop lying to ourselves? The fact that I am tangled up in this mess illustrates how out of touch with reality these drug laws are, especially the laws pertaining to the personal use of marijuana.

And yet Governor Christie says he will veto any legislation that decriminalizes it. Why? Why waste valuable resources prosecuting non violent drug offenders, and the occasional innocents who get caught up in it (me), when you could use those resources on ACTUAL crime? If it was decriminalized it would lower the priority for law enforcement, freeing up valuable resources and restoring a certain respect back to the law.

When you demonize and outlaw a substance that is widely accepted to be medicine, and is used regularly by such a large portion of the population, you undermine the credibility of all laws. We should look up to the law and respect it, revere it even; but when laws are ruining peoples' lives for the sake of a plant, it makes it hard to feel that the system we have in place is just.

How many of us either smoke marijuana or know someone who does? Probably all of us. Let's bring this issue out of the dark. We're not criminals, let's stop being treated like we are."	t5_2qhsu	True

So, same as last time, kiddos!  It was lots of fun even though there were only a [handful of us.](http://i.imgur.com/gL2T5.jpg)  Bring towels, sunscreen, water, a volleyball, your kids, your significant others, a boombox (do those still exist?), bathing suits (looking at you, grand_marquis).

A Sunday this time!  Oh-la-la!  

Deets:

**All ages welcome!** Everyone is invited, spread the word. We can gather by Madame Marie.

The 4th avenue beach entrance is a perfect spot to meet up. There is ample parking, especially if you arrive early.  Parking is 1 dollar per hour, and there are a few lots scattered about that allow you to pay for the day. The Asbury Park train station is about half a mile away. It is on the North Jersey Coastline, and the schedule is [here.](http://www.njtransit.com/pdf/rail/R0080.pdf) I know you can bring your bikes on the train, too. It's a five minute bike ride to the beach from the train station. Buses also run right down to the beach, and those schedules can also be found on the [NJ transit website.](http://www.njtransit.com/hp/hp_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=HomePageTo) It's also very easy to get to Asbury via the parkway and routes 35, 36, 34, 66, 33, 18.

A few of you local types never surfaced.  For shame!  Ikilledyourcat and myself did go to visit a super awesome Redditor who owns a business right on the boardwalk, and he was kind enough to press an Asbury Park shirt for him!  So that was neat.  The rest of you have no excuse.  This was seriously such a chill day.  Everyone is nice, I promise.  So try to not SAP out next time, ok y'all?  Just come!  

There is LOTS of stuff to do.  We can rent [these things](http://sandblastweekend.com/Fun_%26_Play_files/Brielle%20Cyclery%20pic.jpg) on the boardwalk.  How awesome would that be?  There is mini golf, many places to eat, many places to drink, [Criterion](http://www.criterionchocolates.com/) should be re-opened by then inside convention hall which means SALT WATER TAFFY!  There are bathrooms, outside showers, water fountains, etc.  Just come out!  DO IT DO IT DO IT!  

Ok.  See you there.  Oh yea, daily beach badges are six bucks on the weekends.  You can purchase them when you purchase your parking if that makes things easier for you.  

edit: You can rent beach chairs and umbrellas.  I think they're five dollars a piece for the day.  Also, there is a pinball arcade on the boardwalk that a fellow Redditor works at.  It's awesome!  There's also a water park for the kiddies which looks awesome and I might go in because I'm a 30 year old toddler.  

edit again: apparently it's [sand blast weekend](http://sandblastweekend.com/Home.html) and i have no clue what that means other than [there will be humans everywhere and we'll have even more fun!](http://i.imgur.com/ThJ7O.png) thank you LibraryGal for the meme :)

**OMG AN EDIT** (7/17)

so OP herself (me) might not be able to make it?  SACRILEGE!  tl;dr my sisser in law is 2 cm dialated, which means her vagina is about to explode and push out her 3rd [babby](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-is-babby-formed).  this means if this happens this weekend, i am on toddler duty for the two existing babbys while everyone else in my family gets to smoke cigars and do all the other new babby arrival thangs.   

I AM EXCITED TO MEET MY BABBY NIECE, I HOPE SHE WAITS UNTIL MONDAY.

but if she doesn't, who wants to volunteer to be the recipient for the 800 ""where are you guys lol"" texts?  someone who will DEFINITELY be there and be there EARLY should do this.  also, someone make a giant reddit identifying something or another so people can find you in the crowd.  i will update this if anything changes, but someone else should take charge because shit's all up in the air for me because of a uterus.

The pickup had NJ tags and a sticker on it that said ""9/11 was an inside job"". He sped off so I couldn't get his plates and, being a new driver, I was stunned and afraid and it didn't occur to me to follow him. He was headed toward Bellmawr. I called the Bellmawr police department, but if any of you happen to see this car or know what I'm talking about, please let me know. I'm only 17 and this could mean no Senior Trip or France class trip and there's a chance the frame could be bent, rendering my car useless. Thanks!

As we move through the recovery stages in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, we are looking for more ways to help those who were impacted to rebuild and return to their normal lives.
 
I am pleased to announce that we are creating an employee volunteer program to provide support to our communities. 
 
Over the next few days, we will be implementing the COMPANY “Restore the Shore” program, which will run through December 31, 2012. You will be able to sign up with your colleagues to volunteer at specific events in our local area. 

As part of this program, you may volunteer up to three days in 2012 without having to use an FDO. Watch for an email from Hurricane Sandy Relief for details.
 
I am very proud of the way you have rallied and responded to those hit hardest by this disaster. Thank you for your continued dedication to each other and to our community.

It's an extra-tropical cyclone. It's kind of a mix between a nor'easter and a hurricane, making it twice the fun! ALSO, add in a dash of astronomically high tides (I can personally attest to this from the flooding around here lately with NO rain), and you're in for a lot of flooding. They're calling for up to 10 inches of rain in a best case scenario. DO NOT FUCK AROUND. See a flooded road? DONT DRIVE THROUGH IT. 

Shore faring folks that might/will probably get evacuated, meet up with people in this thread for places to stay. Swap emergency supplies and make sure you have an emergency plan in place. Your local office of emergency management will be of much help.

1362368026.0	19m7nd	Update on this weeks storm. 	CaptainColeslaw	81	32	39	"7:30pm Update - my take on the upcoming winter storm this week.. this is a very difficult forecast..as far as rain / snow ..what we do know so far is a major storm will develop off the Va coast and slide either up along the coast or east a bit..either way this will be a powerful storm and will bring tides very high.. I would expect to see evacuations in areas where Sandy struck.. there will be a storm surge of over 4 to 7 ft. and very high -high tides..there will be strong on shore winds from the north east in excess of 45 mph and could be as high as 60 mph...now the tricky part - temps..the onshore wind flow will keep temps warmer along the coast..however if the storm intensifies quickly and can pull cold air down from aloft we could see a wet heavy snow in our area, however surface temps would keep accumulations down at this point.. HOWEVER.. ( the even trickier part - the models are not in total agreement about position and track -if the storm tracks south we will see less precip.. if it tracks a little north and east more of NJ could see snow or more of a mix..) Right now I see the I-95 corridor west getting snow- east of that a mix or rains..if the storm hugs the coast then the snow will be more inland toward Philly..and less in NJ..and all rain along the coast..we are in a wait and see.. this low pressure is 1000's of miles west of us now and a lot could happen, the models indicate a slow moving system..with sustained winds and a storm surge along with high tide cycles we will have out hands full along the shore ( even without snow ).. a classic Nor' Easter.. as always I will continue to watch this system and post updates more frequently as we get closer.. right now looks like a Wednesday into Thursday event - but could start late Tuesday night.. OEM, POLICE, FIRE, EMERGENCY RESPONDERS SHOULD ALL MONITOR THIS STORM....

EDIT: Just got back from voting and if anyone's still on the fence, only 40 people had voted at my location. That's 40 votes total split between both parties and considering the polling period is 2/3's over, turnout is looking really low. If anyone's worried about declaring a party, it literally consists of you saying ""I want to vote for party X"" and them writing DEM or REP next to your name. If you really feel strongly about not being part of a party, you can vote, [fill out this form](http://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/form_pdf/party-affiliation-form-062011.pdf) and then mail it in tomorrow and you'll no longer affiliated with a party."	t5_2qhsu	True

Also, I've jumped through every one of the hoops out there, so might be able to help others. AMA?	El_Dubious_Mung	55	11	31	"Since Hurricane Sandy, using what happened after Katrina as a guide, I've told everyone that the days and weeks after the storm were irrelevant. It's the months and years afterwards that really matter. Little did I know how right I'd be.

I live in Atlantic City. It took us about a week to get back onto the island after the storm. This was because the utility companies had to clean up downed wires, but also to check the gas mains for leaks. No one seems to remember that the gas company spent the weeks before the storm working on the distribution system bumping up the pressure from 5psi to 60psi. We had early warnings about the storm. Why didn't anyone think to tell the gas company to prepare? Maybe it's a non-issue, but some distribution of information may have helped that.

We get back to the house, and it looks like hell. We got about 5 ft of flooding, with about 2ft inside the house. Kitchen, living room, dining room, laundry room, garage, motorcycle, car....all kaput. 

Now, we have a flood insurance policy of $250k, with contents covered, so we think we're alright.....nope. My dad made sure to get his claim in quickly, as the office was nearby. Then the waiting game starts. It was probably close to 2 months before we had an adjuster stop by. Not the insurance company adjuster, but a private one. We got tired of waiting. 

All in all, the damages were assessed at just under $150k (I'm being non-specific about personal details, because I really don't want the insurance company getting wind of this. I don't know if it would cause any trouble, but I don't wanna take the chance). 

Eventually the private adjuster gets the insurance adjuster out to our house, and they both begin the bargaining process. They both agree the damages are in the six figure range. So we wait and wait and wait....

In the meantime, FEMA lays out the new floodzones. These are labeled A zones and V zones. A zones are just flood damage. V zones are areas affected by wind and wave action. This is a very important distinction, as it affects your flood insurance rates. If you have a mortgage in a flood zone, you are REQUIRED to have flood insurance.

If you're in a V-zone, and you don't raise your house above the flood levels, your yearly insurance rates could be as high as $20,000. Guess who got put into a V-zone? 

Now, here's the kicker. FEMA screwed up. My area was only affected by flood damage, not wind and wave action. They based their data off of westerly winds. Any sailor in the area can tell you ""West is the best"". Westerly winds blow water OUT of the bay, not into it. Furthermore, if there was westerly wind action, my dad's boat would have destroyed the house it was docked next to. 

My father attended the meeting with county officials and FEMA where they hashed out the floodzones. He brought up the issue of their faulty data. Mayor Langford of Atlantic City needs to be fired. He didn't say a word, and left 15 minutes into the meeting.  

After that meeting, FEMA makes a statement saying that its new flood zone maps are just preliminary, and may need revision, so county officials shouldn't be too quick to act on that data. I dunno if my dad had anything to do with that, but I like to think so. 

Doesn't matter, though, because Christie comes in and says that NJ is running with those maps. Says we can't wait for FEMA to get their act together before we can rebuild. Who cares if no one has enough money to raise their house (easily costing $100k+) as the insurance companies are only giving out money to rebuild the houses as they were, not how they should be. 

During this time, the only rebuilding going on is people doing it out of pocket. Flood insurance is backed by FEMA, so the insurance companies are waiting for FEMA to dole it out. All those laborers from the rest of the country who came into help start bailing empty-handed, some even down some money as they started rebuilding out of their pocket hoping the clients insurance company would come through. 

One has to ask, why did FEMA start handing out cash left and right to those without insurance, but those with insurance had to wait? I have nothing against those who needed help, but hey, we needed help, too. What were we paying for all those years? Where did that money go? I strongly expect someone was robbing Peter to pay Paul. It would be great if some investigator followed the money trail. 

So about a week ago, we get a check from the insurance company.....for half of what the damages were assessed at. Exactly half. Along with it came a note that under new FEMA guidelines, basically the insurance company gives out some money, and then you can appeal for more, up to the limits of your policy. 

I am infuriated. The only logic I can see behind this is that it's like a rebate. You buy something for a price, then you send in the rebate. Meanwhile, they get to keep that extra little bit of cash to invest. The only viable option we have is to completely rebuild, as our house can't be raised. This means we need every cent we were assessed at before we can even get started. Who knows how long this appeals process will take. 

From that check, since we have a mortgage, we have to send the mortgage company the check, and then they dole out money from those funds for us to get started (which we can't). They take about 30% of the money to hold on to.  So we're working with about 1/3 of our total assessed damage value. 

Another speed-bump: If you're behind on your mortgage, they can hold onto the full amount of any insurance check. Our mortgage company told us we were behind. This was false. After presenting them with evidence of all the payments made, they fixed the issue. Be on the lookout for this. Might have been a mistake, but let's just say this bank is a very big one known to screw people over left and right.

I'm sure I left out other details, and maybe this was just a chance to vent for me, but I'd like people to know what kinda shadyness is afoot. A lot of things smell like a land-grab, others seem like a ponzi-scheme. I admit I don't have all the facts, but there's enough going on that this kinda stuff needs to be thoroughly investigated and monitored.

1326936565.0	omfvu	So, I wrote an E-mail to Sen. Frank Lautenberg; here was his response. 	a34tjkx	45	4	36	"Dear Mr. a34tjkx:
 
Thank you for contacting me with your concerns about the PROTECT IP Act.  I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue.
 
The “Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property (PROTECT IP) Act of 2011” (S. 968) would give law enforcement additional tools to combat the illegal online sale of counterfeit or copyright infringing goods.  Specifically, this bill would give the Attorney General the power to serve issued court orders on search engines, payment processors, advertising networks, and Internet service providers.  It would allow suit against site operators, but would not allow law enforcement to block access to a site.  This bill would also require plaintiffs to sue the owner or registrant of a domain name before bringing suit against a site itself.  
 
The “PROTECT IP Act” was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in May 2011 and now awaits action by the full Senate.  Please be assured that I will keep your views in mind as the Senate considers this issue.  Thank you again for contacting me.
 
FRL:mts

Sincerely,

Frank R. Lautenberg

I know a handful of you are focusing your attention on Sen. Menendez because he is a co-sponsor to the bill, but I suggest you also write/contact Sen. Lautenberg.

Edit: still out of power, all my friends around me losing it as well. One went to the supermarket but they sent everybody home when they lost power and she ended up buying nothing. Power lines, branches, and car accidents everywhere...

Edit 2 (7:52 PM): 6 hours later and the power is still out but I have faith that it will return... Everybody else has lost it too but usually the town can get their power up and running by the end of night unless it's a rare case like Irene was... Anyways, be safe everybody.

Basically, I'd be fronting the money and then renting out the rooms. It would come out to $704/per room PLUS utilities (gas, electric, internet, and lawn care). I have one guy who's seen the place and is interested so far, but I need two more people before I am willing to sign the lease (since I obviously don't want to lose money). It's pretty close to town. If you're interested, or want more details let me know!

If it matters, I'm 25/f and the other person is 26/m. Also, I have a cat that would be coming with me, but the landlord said we can't have any other pets in addition to that.
