1374026791.0	1ighgb	It's hot. Make some ice cream, no special machine required. [x-post /r/budgetfood]	adaranyx	507	75	51	"It might not be THE most budget dessert, depending on where you live, but it's delicious and flexible nonetheless.

1. I use a pint of heavy cream and a small can of sweetened condensed milk. It makes quite a bit, I'd say about 8 cups. I already had the SCM on hand, but it cost me about a dollar. The cream was $1.25. Combine the two in a mixing bowl, and use a mixer or whisk to form stiff peaks. 

2. Then add in your toppings. Today I made chocolate banana. I used 3 over-ripe bananas (usually can be found heavily discounted at the store), and an old Easter bunny. *Yes, I still have Easter candy sitting around*...I swear it was super on sale. You could also just use cocoa powder, but I like chocolate chunks. Yesterday, I made vanilla blueberry (homegrown blueberries, but I think they're on sale at Kroger this week, as well). 

3. Stick it in some tupperware, put it in the freezer, and wait. Every 45 minutes or so, stir it up with a rubber spatula or spoon (this helps make it creamier). I'm not sure exactly how long it takes to get to full-fledged ice cream status...I never remember to pay attention...but it's not too long! 

It's cheaper even than buying store-brand, and you can make it whatever flavour you want! Plus you get the novelty of saying ""I made this"".

1372247587.0	1h3pa6	For the fluffiest of fluffy waffles!!! (Health consciousness too!)	DwelveDeeper	215	43	66	"I love this subreddit, but have yet to contribute to it. I made waffles just now and realized it's something you guys may like.

**Recipe**:

2 cups bisquick

1 egg

1/2 cup vegetable oil

1 1/3 cup club soda

""generous"" dash of vanilla extract

Also remember to preheat your waffle iron and spray with pam or crisco

Add ons:

chocolate chips! (I place them 30 seconds to 1 minute after I close the waffle iron so the chocolate doesn't burn the skillet)

Blueberries

My family has been using this recipe for years, and I know others are familiar with it because it's not exactly a secret recipe, but still a lot aren't familiar with it. 

Those who aren't familiar with it, I know that using club soda instead of milk sounds weird but **trust** me, you will not regret it!! Your waffles will taste like a breakfast dish sent from heaven and the texture might as well be designer brand fluff (whatever that means).

Please let me know if you try the recipe and/or if other users know about the club soda trick and if they have any modifications to the recipe. Hope y'all enjoy your waffles.

Some personal tips:

I personally enjoy my waffles a little bit thinner so I add club soda until the batter is almost runny. Then I add vanilla extract till it passes the ""runny"" threshold, then I add just a bit more club soda. This makes the waffles get done quickly because the batter is so thin. They're still deliciously fluffy but they wont absorb syrup like a sponge which I don't prefer at all.

**Also**, I just realized this, but it may be a health consciousness alternative because it doesn't have milk.. I added it to the subtitle. I personally love milk and have never eaten these pancakes with out a glass of milk, but those who don't prefer milk may like this even more because you don't need it in the recipe.

Hope you enjoy!!"	t5_2u5q1	True

DjJukebox206	179	49	14	"It has now been nearly 10 years since I inherited all the family recipes. I've started compiling all the old family recipes with some of my own into a new cook book. 

Below is one of my own. (Inspired by Grandma's pot roast) 
 
Sloppy Fat man French Dips

Prep Time: 30 mins. 
Cook Time: 3-4 hours

You will need:
1x Dutch oven
1x Lg. plate to let roast rest
2x Big Forks
1x Colander or Wire mesh strainer
1x Lg Bowl or high sided pan for the juice

For the Beef:
1 2-4lb roast. Doesn't matter what kind, I usually buy whatever is cheapest (make sure it's beef though.)
2 tbsp Olive Oil
2 tbsp Minced Garlic
1 Med White or Yellow Onion (I avoid reds and sweets as a personal preference, but feel free to try.)
Approx. 4 Cups Beef broth (+Water to cover roast) 
1 Cup cheap red wine (optional but any 2 buck chuck will work.)
Red pepper flakes
Italian Seasoning (any brand will work)
Kosher or Sea Salt
Black pepper (I use crushed tellecherry)  

 For the Sandwiches:
Hoagie or outdoor rolls (Bread works too)
Cheese (Swiss and Provalone are my favorites)
Anything else you want on the sandwich (peppers, onions, pickles, go wild)

Prep: 

Set out roast 30-60 minutes before cooking. Lightly salt and pepper. 

Rough chop medium onion.

Preheat oven to 300'F 

Add 2-3 tbsp olive oil to dutch oven. (Let pan heat up before adding roast.)

Brown roast on all sides.  Approx 2 minutes per side. 
(If the oil starts to smoke it's too hot. Turn it down slightly.)

Roast should have a medium brown crisp, and still be running red juices.

Remove roast and set aside for now. 

In the dutch oven, over medium heat-high heat: 

Combine leftover juice/olive oil and onions. 

Saute until opaque (becoming transparent.) 

Add Minced garlic, saute 1 minute. 

Add 2 tbsp Italian Seasoning and 1 tsp Crushed red pepper or red pepper flake. 
Add a dash dash of salt and pepper. Maybe 1 tsp each. 

Cook for another 1-2 minutes until your whole damn house smells like a pizzeria. 
Deglaze with cheap red wine.
If not using wine just deglaze with 1 cup of beef broth.
This will turn to a simmer fairly quick. When it does, add remaining beef broth.
Stir.

Carefully add roast. (if broth does not completely cover, add a little water until it does.) 

Cover with lid and put in oven. 

Cook 3-4 hours, turning the roast over once every 30-40 minutes.

Approx 3 hrs for 2lbs / 4 hrs for 4-lbs

Check it at 3 hours with a fork. If it is beginning to fall apart, remove from oven. If not ready cook another 30 minutes and check again. 

Remove roast from juice and set on plate. Shred with two big forks. 

Pour juice/onions/cooked bits into colander over large bowl. 

*Save strained juice for dipping. 

For the rolls: (I prefer toasted.)

*Toast open faced with cheese under the broiler or in a toaster oven.  

*Add beef+chosen sandwich toppings to your roll and dip the whole thing in the juice. 

This is called “Dragging it through the river.” -Sloppy as can be, but leaves you feeling rewarded in a primal sense. 

Or dip it on the side. If you prefer to be civilized about it. 

Enjoy! 

Feeds 4-8  (Or just you with awesome lunches for the rest of the week.)
Goes great with just about any side. 

I've even added my homemade barbecue sauce to the leftovers and made great bbq beef. Delicious with Hawaiian rolls and pineapple slices!

My best recipe so far (makes one large tall glass):

* 1,5 cups milk

* 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder

* 1 tablespoon of sugar (I prefer powder sugar, but if you want to make it even healthier you could use stevia or something similar )

* 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of vanilla sugar

1.) Just a recipe/photo of food.  If it's not a 'hack', go post on r/food, or r/cooking

2.) Today this subreddit is FILLED with 'simple cheese stick' results.

Why do we need this?  Why is this getting upvoted?

3.) Tips and tricks generally don't get the exposure that a picture of food will get.  Please, PLEASE change this.  If you want to look at tasty food, go to r/food, r/cooking, or even better, r/foodporn.  Please utilize the handy dandy upvote/downvote system to keep tips and tricks on top, and simple photos on the bottom.

Take a large pitcher and 2 or 3 of your favorite fruits (For my first attempt it was Kiwi, Strawberry &amp; Lime) Slice fruit, put into pitcher.. Add about 1 - 2 inches of Crushed/Bagged ice, add another layer of fruit, fill to the top with ice, throw a bit more fruit on top (for good measure).  Now, fill the entire pitcher/container with water and place in the fridge/drink as desired. I found that in my fridge, by the end of day 4 (early day 5) there was still ""some ice"" in the water.  You can also replenish the water as you drink to ensure it stays full for those days.

I have nearly stopped drinking soda all together since I started doing this.  The reason I call this ""Vitamin"" water, is, as the fruits break down they become tiny miniscule particles and you drink them naturally.  Clearly, there are any vitamins as provided by the fruit itself.

Other combinations I have tried:

Blackberry Banana, &amp; Lemon

Blackberry, Raspberry and Lime

I just discovered this after looking at the ingredients I had available in my kitchen. This recipe is high-protein, low-carb, and low-fat if you use tuna packed in water instead of oil. It also does not require a blender, just a bowl and a fork. I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I just did!

* 1 can of chunk tuna packed in water
* 2-3 spoonfuls of tahini
* cumin
* salt
* pepper
* lemon juice
* garlic and olive oil (optional; I didn't use either but they are common hummus ingredients. Olive oil adds fat and calories, which can be good or bad, and would probably make the end result more dip-like).

Drain tuna and place in bowl. Add tahini. Mash and mix with a fork until consistency is even. Add other ingredients to taste and mix again.

1370148880.0	1fi6hz	Super easy Nutella ice cream.	bleepapuss	47	10	7	"I found this out while trying to make Nutella fudge-pops.

Mix nutella (or any hazlenut-chocolate) and milk. Freeze for a few hours. That's literally all there is to it.

I personally added a bit of cocoa powder and a pinch of salt. Since I made them in Popsicle molds, I'd suggest that when you freeze it, cover the container. That way you don't get icky water and ice in there.

It's crazy easy."	t5_2u5q1	True

Begin to prepare an over-easy (or -medium, or -hard) egg in a buttered pan. After the egg white has turned opaque, place a tbs or two of a firm cheese you have handy [gruyere is great, cheddar works well] atop the egg. Flip the egg for the first and only time until the egg yolk is prepared to your liking.


I prefer the yolk over-medium, and this seems to result in a perfectly crispy cheesy crust on one side. So simple and great... why is this not a thing (or should I have already known about this)?"	t5_2u5q1	True

* Canned biscuit dough

* Oil for Frying (I use vegetable oil)

* Toppings for donuts.

First, take a pan or pot and fill with a few inches of oil.  Heat it up to about 350 degrees (med-high heat.)

Open the canned biscuits.  Separate the biscuits.  Flatten them slightly with your hands.  Using a shot glass, cut out the center of each biscuit disk.

Carefully put the disk in the oil.  After 1 or 2 mins (or when it is golden brown) flip it!  Drain on paper towels.

Fry the holes as well!

Then put icing, sugar,etc, whatever toppings you want.

They are best eaten warm.  I didn't really care for them the next day.

I also felt like being lazy and didn't want to go out and get all of the ingredients every time I wanted a burger so I did the following:

1. Mix up hamburger in a bowl
2. Take parchment paper or wax paper and lay out a long strip
3. Make equal size balls of hamburger and spread evenly on the paper
4. Hand press each ball into a patty, don't worry about perfection as the imperfections make them easier to separate later.
5. Using scissors, cut the paper in a square around each patty.
6. In 1 or 2 gallon freezer bags stack patties, try to remove as much air before sealing
7. Place in freezer
8. Enjoy a burger whenever you want a quick meal
(note: make sure to wash scissors with soap before returning to your child's activity box)

Bonus: I was also getting tired of making bacon cheeseburgers all the time, so I decided I would try something new and picked up some breakfast sausage instead. I would first make sausage patties to stack on top of a burger, but would end up making the whole thing too bulky. Finally I tried mixing 1lb of breakfast sausage with 2lbs of hamburger and found the perfect combination and haven't looked back. I know people feel the need to add seasoning and marinades to their burgers, but allowing the taste of the sausage to come through makes all the difference.
 
Tl;dr recipe: 
1. 2lbs of hamburger
2. 1lb of breakfast sausage
3. mix well

Place eggs in the removable rice cooker bowl (make sure the eggs don't have any cracks)

1. Wash and fill with cold water (*tip: if you have many eggs, the water will float the eggs and help create even space between them*. I don't recommend having more eggs that what touches the bottom of the bowl)

1. Drain most of the water - but leave just enough in the bowl to cover the bottom. (add salt if you want - but not necessary)

1. Set to steam for 15-20 min (depending on how long it takes your cooker to warm up - mine is fast so in 15 they're a little soft-boiled,by 18 min they're perfect.

1. Remove immediately and refrigerate - makes the shells easier to peel.

There is also some debate on whether older vs newer eggs peel better, adding lemon juice, baking soda, and using ice water afterwards. 

I've been doing this method for a few years and never had a problem peeling easily with the rice cooker method as long as you don't cook them for more than 20 min.

KellieMorgan	17	5	2	"Take a small or medium sized sauce pan (1 or 2 quart pans would work) and add 1 1/2 cups of sugar, then fill it with water. Bring this sugar water to a boil. Very important to boil the sugar in the water. Don't ask me why, I just do as grandma says. 
Once boiling, remove from heat and add either 8 regular sized tea bags or one of Lipton's large Gallon Size Tea Bags works very well for me. Submerge tea bag(s) and leave to seep covered for 10 - 12 minutes. The longer you seep, the stronger your tea will taste. 
Remove the tea bags and pour your concentrate sweet tea in a gallon sized pitcher. I use washed empty milk containers. Fill your pitcher to full with refreshing cold water. I usually stick it in the fridge till it's nice and cold. 
If you don't feel like waiting then pour over ice, squeeze a few drops of lemon juice over the top if desired, and you've got the most perfect glass of southern sweet tea you'll ever taste.

If you don't have a range or a clean pan and you're in a hurry to get out the door but you want some eggs for a good breakfast, you can use a coffee mug and a microwave to speed-cook scrambled eggs. You just crack an egg into a (microwave safe) coffee mug and scramble it, add a bit of milk or cream, and put the mug in the microwave for about 2 minutes depending on the microwave. It'll cook and puff up in the mug. If it looks a little runny give it another 30 seconds.

The best part of this is that it comes out in a nice circular shape, so you can toast an english muffin while you're making the egg, slap the cooked egg in between the halves, maybe add a slice of cheese or some ham if you want, and you've got an easy breakfast sandwich. Add in a banana and it makes a great commute meal."	t5_2u5q1	True
1373651860.0	1i610j	Campbell's Tomato Soup Hack	tartcouplet	15	3	7	"/u/thebestwes's ramen hack reminded me of a great tip for plain old Campbell's tomato soup. It also involves adding peanut butter--but first, saute some garlic and onion in the bottom of your saucepan. Spices also go a long way in this one--after stirring some peanut butter into your garlic and onion, add cumin and either cayenne or tabasco sauce (or both!) Then, make your soup on top of it all as normal. Voilà--Moroccan Tomato Soup! 

It's especially good if you drop some unsalted cashews in the bowl before ladling it out. So good, so easy, and you can have it as a main course (the peanut butter is very filling) or as a side dish to Moroccan spiced salmon, kefta, or whatever else you're having for dinner.  "	t5_2u5q1	True

2) Go to the condiment/milk bar and fill it to the top with your milk/creamer of choice.


Note:  Most coffee houses have a different pricing scheme when you order an iced ""latte""  but if you order an ""espresso"", most places only can go up to a double espresso pricing scheme then they charge you for the two add-shots.  The double espresso with 2 add shots are cheaper than a regular latte even though the latte only has 2 shots in it.  

The physical difference between the two drinks is that the iced latte is 2 shots with cold milk over ice whereas the quad espresso is a double espresso with 2 add shots over ice.  You can get milk at the condiment bar for free.  You'll save about 50cents or more."	t5_2u5q1	True

You can use it as a rub on chicken, steak or shrimp before cooking. Once cooked slice your meat up for tacos, enchiladas, fajitas, etc. If you have leftover chicken or steak saute some diced onions and peppers (optional but tasty), mix in cubed meat, a little water or stock, and taco seasoning -- again good in any Mexican type dish! And if you're a vegetarian you can use it on tofu too! Slice tofu into 1/8-1/4 inch slabs, sprinkle with taco seasoning, then bake/saute/grill to preferred doneness.  

My whole childhood the only ""Mexican"" dish my parents made at home was tacos with ground beef. Now that I'm an adult and I can play around with what I cook this has become and awesome hack. Also good to add with anything Mexican-ish: fresh cilantro, lime juice or chipotle pepper paste.

A food hack for homemade taco seasoning would be swell, share if you have one. I've tried homemade before and my husband prefers store bought so I gave up. 

Earlier this week I had some leftover dark meat rotisserie chicken and baked chicken breast -- probably 1 1/2 pounds total. Sauteed onions and peppers, added cubed chicken, simmered for 20 minutes with about 1/2 cup chicken stock, packet of low sodium taco seasoning and a tablespoon of chipotle pepper paste then finished with a few tablespoons of lime juice and a handful of chopped cilantro.

Pour 1/2c of your preferred brand of pasta sauce (I like prego traditional heart smart b/c it's less salty.) on one side of a large-ish frying pan (med heat). Let it simmer as you scramble two eggs on the other side - if you don't get some of the water out, the final product will be runny. (For fewer dishes, scramble in pan.) Throw some cheese in the middle (or on the eggs) to get it melty.

1374693758.0	1iz4v3	Scrambled eggs with a twist!	wendy420	31	32	12	"I've been trying to eat healthier lately, and this morning I made some scrambled eggs. It's a great way to get your protein and veggie fix early in the day so you will be full of energy! This is how I made mine, however you can use whatever vegetables you have sitting around your house. You can also change the amounts of anything - this recipe is very versatile.


3 Large Eggs

A couple slices of deli ham

A few handfuls of spinach

About 1/3 of a small onion

Tomatoes (I used about 7 baby tomatoes and sliced them up)

A splash of milk

1 slice American cheese (optional)

Salt and pepper (optional)




Slice ham, onions, and tomatoes (and spinach if you prefer smaller pieces, but they shrink once they are cooked fully so I didn't feel it was necessary). Crack eggs into pan on medium heat. Add a splash of milk and stir until yolks are broken. Add other ingredients and stir for a couple minutes. When the eggs are fully cooked and no longer liquidy, it is ready! Scoop onto plate and place cheese on top to melt.

Some other veggies that would probably be good to add are peppers, broccoli, or peas. Anything you want!

I like this recipe because it's very versatile and doesn't take long to prepare. Enjoy! I also have a picture of my final result,so if anybody is interested I will upload it."	t5_2u5q1	True

1374004854.0	1ifp4l	[Test] Reggae Reggae Bacon, in my opinion the most epiphanic food conceivable.	Catalyxt	1	1	0	"Here's something that, to my knowledge, only brits can enjoy without buying from a speciality store/online. Bacon is God's gift to man. [Reggae Reggae Sauce](http://www.leviroots.com/product-details/_/reggae-reggae-jerkbbq-sauce/10/2/) is Levi Roots gift to man. When you put these two ingredients together a flavour is created so beautiful that I had a massive existential crisis as a result of eating it...

**Instructions:**
1) Slam some bacon in a hot, dry frying pan (warning: do not actually slam)
2) Slather your Reggae Reggae sauce all over the upwards side of the bacon (henceforth to be known as side 1, the underside is side 2)
3) After a couple of minutes, or whenever, it's impossible to muck this up, flip them strips and sauce up side 2.
4) About a minute before you take it out, flip again to make sure the sauce is cooked into side two.
5) Experience the flavour.

**TL,DR:** marinade bacon in Reggae Reggae Sauce, then fry it and love it."	t5_2u5q1	True

As a student KD was my go-to for quick and easy meals but besides a splash of milk there's basically nothing in it with nutritional value. 

In an attempt to make KD a substantial meal I throw real cheddar cheese, butter, milk and 1/2 of the cheese powder contents into a magic bullet blender along with some fresh produce and any leftovers I have (leftover chicken is great, so is canned salmon or tuna; beef tastes good with the right vegetables, but colors strangely). Adding garlic, crushed peppers or any of your other favorite spices is also great.

As far as fresh produce I've had great success blending tomatoes, sweet and jalapeno peppers and steamed baby spinach (though the spinach again did some weird stuff to the color). 

Finally, for an extra thick and rich sauce I crack in an egg before blending and then slightly under-cook the noodles before draining then put them back on medium heat with the (egg) sauce for 3-5 minutes."	t5_2u5q1	True
