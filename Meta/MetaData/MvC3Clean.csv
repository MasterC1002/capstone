1323153944.0	n28my	A little PSA on Ultimate	Vexatious	62	6	66	"Alright, some people aren't having fun with this game and I understand that, but I'm getting really tired of all the ""What happened to this game, Ultimate sucks"" mentality floating around.

We had vanilla, we have DHC glitch running rampant, very OP assists in gustaf flame and lariat which new players flocked to, and even Dark Phoenix just because Capcom didn't think we had it hard enough. We had glitches out of our ass, a cast that only the top 10 really mattered, and a metagame completely centralized around rushdown and nothing more.

For all intents and purposes, the game was broken, it was stupid, but we pushed through and had fun.

Now Capcom is giving us a brand new game (I really consider it brand new. Characters, stages, modes, balance, all new stuff. Sue me I think New Vegas is Fallout 4) and it's fixing its mistakes. Just going off of what was wrong with Vanilla: 

DHC glitch gone. No more can a simple DHC one shot the entire cast. While we're on that topic, one shotting the cast without 5 bars (Even using xfc levels 1 and 2!) is actually difficult.

Invincible assists are gone. No more relying on the ""push a button get a combo"" door prize. If you want an invincible assist to abuse, you have to work for it. Haggar is risky and doesn't give you a hard knockdown, Hsien-Ko still requires a bar and some relative risk/setup to use, and Phoenix Wright well have fun you earned it.

Dark Phoenix? With the nerfs to her air options, her health decrease, air x-factor, and side-exchanges, we have a much more balanced character. Still great, but you have to earn it and play smart.

With the recent buffs and new characters, we have a lot larger of a viable cast. To be honest, I think just about every character (bar a few) is completely viable.

Rushdown? Meet solid keepaway. With Ghost rider being slept on, Hawkeye being amazing, and general keepaway characters getting faster tools (Dante's air play, Ammaterasu's cold star, Deadpools guns, I believe dooms projectiles, and many more) with more priority, keepaway is seeming more and more viable as a lockdown/chip strategy.

Overall they have really overhauled this game when you look at it, but all people care about is that ""so and so character is bad now, or, so and so character is broken now."" 

What I want you to do is look at Vanilla and tell me you didn't think Sentinel was broken in the first few weeks up until his health nerf. Months later, go back to playing against a Sentinel on an un-updated disc. He's no different and he's still workable around. Instead of learning how to deal with it, we bitched and moaned and now he's worse off because of it.

Wesker right now is the next big thing, but the problem is he's being overhyped. I know that he was used a lot at NEC, but that's not just because of his anchor use. His assist is amazing for being a fast OTG and hitting low. Even if he was decent at best he would still be used for that assist. What we need to do is learn to fight him like we did Phoenix, like we did around assists and x-factor. He lost a LOT of his mixups and resets as well as his longer combos and gun confirms. He lost a lot more than people give him credit for and all he has gotten is the sunglasses.

Yes they are strong, but Dark Wesker was ALREADY strong enough. The glasses don't make a big enough difference if he's only used as an anchor, and with the significant nerfs he's had, he's now indisputably best on anchor. What's the solution? Snap in the problem. This was always the case with Phoenix and if you have to use xfc level 1 to kill him, but take away your opponents only end-game factor, then it was completely worth it. More so, players need to stop with the mentality of ""I have to hit him"" when he's in xfc. 

Just focus on blocking. Alone, Wesker is incredibly easy to read. His teleports always go the same distance so if you see him vanish, block the other direction because you know he'll be behind you. Whether he's above or below, you have time to see which. If he's above, block high, if he's below it's more than likely you block low. People who can fly, people who can teleport or float, people with projectiles, they all lame out his xfactor and once he's done, he's not scary. Not even a little.

With the addition of keepaway and much better runaway, there are strategies around this. For such a rushdown heavy character, just try fighting someone like Trish. It's a damn nightmare for Wesker. He has hard counters like everyone else in the game and I truly believe that. 

I guess to sum up this long winded rant: The game isn't even a month old, stop complaining about miniscule issues now that all the biggest problems are gone. Learn the game, let the metagame grow and form, and if there are still major problems months from now we'll know and so will Capcom. Just relax and play the damn game."	t5_2s01r	True

I've played somewhere around 7500 matches of Marvel so far, online and off. (But mostly online.) I've won local tournaments, but they were mostly potmonster carnivals. I placed high at a Marvel tournament Arcade UFO had a while ago though. I play a lot of characters, but mostly Zero and Dante. I've read the Bradygames Guide front to back. (Best book I've ever read.) Current ranking on XBL is somewhere around 40th in the world. So I know a thing or two about Marvel.

So here, ask me anything that you need help with, or just want to ask a high level player. 

Things you should ask about: Team building, strategy, matchups, execution tips, what character should I play, tiers, what I think about the game, dealing with frustration (Marvel is pretty much designed to get players flustered.) and whatever else you can think of.

And here's my youtube channel. You've probably seen a few of these videos on the frontpage of SRK and the like. http://www.youtube.com/user/EviltoasterofFP?feature=mhee

1367875903.0	1dth3w	Week of self-improvement Vol. 1 - Learn your TAC infinites	Evil_Toaster	62	9	52	"TAC infinites are highly abusable and not even entirely difficult to do. They can turn low damage characters into touch-of-death capable monsters. There's no reason to not know at least one by now.

So here's a list of all **viable** TAC infinites. Pick one up for whichever character you have and spend your training mode time this week learning it. If you do not have a TAC infinite capable character under your belt, well now's the time to get one.

---

[Magneto](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm3y2tranlU). Easy as balls.

[Iron-Man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj4AtK5un7A). Takes a while to learn the setup, but easy to keep going.

[Doctor Doom](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzgOaEpNs8s). Takes practice, but probably one of the best characters to TAC infinite with.

[Nova](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVnB2A1FiWI). Complicated setups on higher altitudes, but no major timing required on the hitstop glitch. 

[Amaterasu](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGUTGiy6orQ) ([+midscreen varants](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euS6jdWMGAw)) I'm actually not sure how easy this is, but if you get the timing down on the 3rd j.H, setting it up isn't so bad.

[Morrigan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVI_FmhQOYQ). Not hard at all once you understand how to input it. No major timing required after the setup.

[Trish](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQjp2i8HHq8). Difficult, but doable. Timing the last j.H is probably the least difficult part of the combo.

[Storm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJRuJ1vlqdI). Not hard. Be sure to use qcb.S+H to get the unfly-&gt;H correctly. (pretty sure that's required, could just be a 'plink')

[Dormammu](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRGY0_CWPWc). Requires a lot of timing and attention, but not terribly complex.

[Chun-Li](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0vnD47ZH1A) ([Non-glitch version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWisBDnfnPg)). Probably hard, but if you play Chun-Li you're probably used to doing stupid combos.

[Sentinel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym9CBXFs7rg). Setup can be tricky, but easy to keep going.

[MODOK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejylq8bJCYQ) ([+midscreen down TAC variant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d045RxeGQC4)). Probably difficult, but again, if you play MODOK you're probably used to these kinds of combos.

[Spencer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dH9S1KBLEc0). Heavy on the timing but Drecker swears he can do it. It works in all directions though, so if you can get past the impractical part, it can be useful.

[Jill](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWT4RgVqBTI). Requires ground bounce, so will only work after an up or side TAC. Easy peasy from there.

[Frank](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO_FoduKvJs). Requires wall bounce, so will only work off up and down TAC's. The falling j.H can be hard to time. This also works in higher frank levels.

[Thor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FebWt_JClKY) No idea how difficult this is to pull off, but is totally possible.

Take it however you like. I for one am not going to get excited over it until there is an official statement from Capcom. I also find the game fine as it is for the most part.

EDIT: I guess this is a good place to share my opinion here since it seems to be catching many people's attention. I personally don't think anyone should be ""nerfed"" by any means. Rather, I feel that underused, low to mid tier characters need to be buffed. Take Rocket Raccoon for example. Seen as low (mid to some people) tier for the most part due to his low health and small damage output that requires a good amount of execution. If he did more damage or did more hitstun on his normals he would be a much better character. She-Hulk is a character that did not deserve to be nerfed. Just bringing her back to her vanilla version will make her much better. Criticisms are more than welcome."	t5_2s01r	True

1368460703.0	1e90j1	Week of Self-Improvement Vol.2 - Learn your Plink Dashing	Evil_Toaster	50	5	37	"Plink Dashing is easily the best form of movement, pretty much everyone can do it. Doesn't require direction input, can be option selected with a few other things, and it's fast as balls. It's something worth having under your belt.

So this week, practice up on your plinking. There are several methods to go about this.

---

**WHAT IS PLINK DASHING?**

Plink dashing is abusing the game's two-button-dash input leniency to dash at ridiculous speeds. The game lets you dash even if you input a button late. So pressing L and M one frame apart will get you a dash even if you were already dashing. Because you can cancel dashes into attacks, pressing L and M one frame apart during a dash will cancel the dash into L, then read the next M input and give you a new dash.

The best way to physically execute this (assuming you play on an arcade stick,) is to have your fingers positioned so your first finger is on top of the button, and your second finger is hovering an inch or two above the second one, then just slam both fingers downward. Your first finger hits first, second finger hits a frame late. Bam, plink dash. On pad, you'll have to get creative with button layout. I hear using a trigger button for this helps.

---

**METHODS**

[](//#ATK)~[](//#ATK)**Two button plinking.** The least lenient method of plink dashing, but is useful if you play a button charge character. It can be done with any two buttons in any order. L~M, L~H, M~H, H~L, M~L, H~M, you get it. It must be inputted one frame apart.

[](//#L)~[](//#M)[](//#H) **Three button plinking.** While this may be slightly harder to input correctly, the extra leniency makes it very worth it. Starting with L and plinking to MH is the easiest method for me just because of the way buttons are positioned on an arcade stick and the angle my fingers are. You can use any button order you like, as long as the last input is with two buttons. When you do this correctly, you will often hear your character speak as if they were performing an attack before dashing. This is because the input leniency is longer than one frame, opposed to how it is in two button plinking. It feels like 2 or 3 frames, but the extra boost is enough to make it very easy.

[](//#L)~[](//#M)~[](//#H) **Piano Method.** I've never figured out this myself, but some players swear by this. If you can slide your finger fast enough, you can get yourself a plink dash just by sliding your fingers.

[](//#H)~([](//#L)[](//#M)[](//#H)) **Schmidt Select.** Probably the most brain dead method of them all, using an extra button mapped to L+M+H macro will let you plink dash with ease. By using the H button first, you option select all your dashes with throws, which is very effective in the air. 

[](//#H)~[](//#L)[](//#M) **FChamp style.** Effectively the same as the Schmidt Select, but does not require you to map an extra button.

[](//#ATK)~[](//#ATK)[](//#H) **Doom/Thor flight mode variant.** Doom and Thor have lingering H attacks, for some reason, this prevents them from being plink dash cancelable. So instead, use L or M to start.

[](//#S)~[](//#ATK)[](//#ATK) **S-Plinking.** Some find this easier due to the button positions, however some characters with S+ATK special moves are not capable of this.

Fronting by saying these are not only my ideas, much of what you read has been raised by other moderators!

Hey all,

Myself and the other mods have been getting a good amount of messages regarding the amount of ""Help my team"" posts that have been popping up.

On one hand, it can be seen as a lack of content. Seeing multiple team help threads every day/week can get a little tiring. The point has been raised that we could create a ""1-800-Help My Team"" thread on the sidebar, or a weekly teambuilding thread.

On the other hand, many of the ""Help"" threads are thrown up by newer members and work incredibly well as a welcome. Also, this is a subreddit dedicated to a single game, so there's not like there's context exploding out of every orifice.

First of all, I'm going to restart the weekly character discussion thread. Second, I want to ask you a question, /r/MvC3. What would you like to see happen with the ""Help my team"" posts? Weekly? Leave them as they are? Some new idea entirely?

1367278693.0	1ddgmf	Wesker: A look at the fallen king	Unit-00	46	7	56	"Wesker is a character that at the begging of this game was a top 3 character, however he was quickly figured out and has since fallen from grace. What was once a character who was in almost every competitive team has now become a rarity in top 8's around the country. Players have ditched the character believing him to have been someone only good at the start of the game but I disagree, Wesker has a lot of tools at his disposal and I think it's time people started using them. Here's a couple things I want to see Wesker players start using.

Note: For this article I'm only talking about point Wesker, it his best position, anchor just doesn't cut it anymore.

* **Run Strider** Vajra is by far Weskers best assist, it gives him teleport mix-ups from anywhere on the screen, it covers every area of the screen even the ones Wesker can't handle, and Wesker can easily OTG and convert if it hits an airborne opponent. It also comes with the benefit of anchor Strider which is never a bad thing to have.

* **Abuse your launcher** Seriously, it's only -1 on block. Just throw it out there, it's an amazing anti-air and 99% of the time you won't be punished for it.

* **Optimize your combo** The time of l.m.h.s.m.m.h.s. otg super is over. Wesker has the ability to get 900 to 1 mil per combo but it's technical and you have to actually practice it. Players like Roach King and Alucard are already stepping up to this.

* **Use the projectile counter** It's a good move, not the best, but good and one correct read on the opponent could lead to a dead character. It's hard to punish as well so it's a low risk high reward situation. Again Roach King and Alucard have been using this to great success lately.


That's all I have for things people need to be doing more of, now I'd like to talk about what, in my opinion, is the optimal Wesker team.


***

And that would be team assist me, Wesker, Doom, Strider but with a twist, I want Doom with Rocks assist. Everyone already knows how Wesker and Strider play and they know how they work together so I'm going to focus on why I think Doom is the best second character (as opposed to say Vergil) and the over all team strategy. 

One of Weskers biggest faults IMO is the glasses mechanic, more so the fact that they are put back on every time Wesker leaves the screen, so even if you get them off with Maximum Wesker if you have to DHC to kill then they're put right back on. The way I came up with to deal with this is to make it so the instead of DHCing out of him you DHC into him and maintain the lack of glasses for the next incoming character. My first thought about how to do this was to do a TAC into Doom and do the old combo into Sphere of Flame then DHC into Maximum for the kill. After thinking about it for a while though it may be possible (and knowing Doom it is) to raw tag into Doom mid combo and finish the opponent that way, removing the risk involved with the TAC. After that it's just a matter of mixing up the other character and repeating and with Wesker and Strider that shouldn't be to hard. 

Now for why I chose to go with Rocks assist. I wanted Dooms assist to bring something new to the table and Strider tracks better than missiles and provides a better teleport cross-up than beam. Rocks does provide a ton of support for the team though, to begin with when it first comes out and is swirling around Doom it can be used as a pseudo Lariat (and everyone knows how well Wesker works with that) providing both a lock down or get off me assist. From there it becomes a good field clearing horizontal assist capable of extending combos and providing mix-up opportunities. The other benefit it has is that it makes Dooms THC the Sphere of Flame instead of Finger Lasers, and that just works amazing with Wesker.

So that's my look at Wesker, what people need to start doing with him, and an optimal team for him. I'd love to discuss more about this so please leave a comment below and lets try to get this man back into the spot light. Also JRosa is the only person I've seen use the team that I described, at least as far as assists go."	t5_2s01r	True

Dreckerr	53	12	48	"Myself, as well as some of the other mods, are getting incredibly buttfurious with the amount of meme posts on here. I come here every day hoping to see useful discussion only to be met by ""LOLTOPTIER"" or some kind of Yipes photoshop, it's getting grinding. One of the only reasons we haven't been deleting them on sight is because as was said by another one of us:

Whenever I see them, they're at 100 up, 30 down. So, I leave them.

(Edit: This is the exception and why we don't delete **every** memepost. Most of the time they have 5-6 up / 10ish down and some reference to /r/kappa in comments - these are the ones we delete)

**Know that from this point forward, being Marvel-related does not make your post fair game.** Unless we see something exceptional, thought-provoking or frankly too hilarious to delete (Shuma TAC Infinite made me chuckle), *we are considering adopting a kill on sight policy. (Edit 12:35PM PST)* **This is up to the discretion of the moderators, we will delete your post if necessary and direct you to /r/kappa**. 

We want this board to be for interesting discussion, theorycraft, help etc, **not** to watch it devolve into stream chat. Everything is up for discussion, if you disagree with any of this please feel free to share your thoughts. We don't want to be the authoritarian dickholes screaming THIS IS FOR SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS OF SERIOUS THINGS, but the frankly useless memeposts are getting out of control. My personal opinion is that with less useless posts, people will have a reason to contribute. 80% of stimulating content or discussion is submitted by me. This isn't me sucking myself off, I have an inbox full of people saying exactly that.

**Note, this is a persistent issue. It's not 3-4 over the last few days, it's our pages getting filled with multi-reports / spamfiltered posts. It's not just happening now and making us buttfurious, it's been that way. (Edited 12:38 PM PST)**

Next time you want to post some stream monster shenanigans, ask yourself if you really think it's worth posting here or if you should head over to /r/kappa - I repeat - /r/kappa is a thing, use it.

* He says that ALL the big japanese mvc3 players are going to Finalround and EVO next year.  
* Kusoru won't come to the US for anymore tourneys because he has no money to travel and he's busy with school and other things. He would go if he was invited though  
EDIT: stuff that I just remembered  
* On JWong's Spider-man play (aka mamejustin)= his spider-man was solid and had good fundamentals but jwong wasn't maximizing his damage  
* Did he feel disrespected by the US team not playing their main characters= not really, he kinda felt bad that they weren't playing to their full strength but since the World team couldn't even beat their B-teams then he can't really complain

1376555462.0	1keplg	On opening people up with Dante	Evil_Toaster	51	11	15	"[](/twibook)I want to clear some air about Dante because he's both a good and bad character but is ultimately a ""required"" character because he has Jam Session, a useful THC, and an install hyper (Devil Trigger) which are all very valuable team assets. But he's got to be on point sooner or later and you're going to have to get a combo eventually so I'm gonna tell you how.

There's two ways to open people up with Dante, which method you do depends on if you have an assist available. If you do, the obvious method is to create a teleport left/right mixup. The other open, which you'll have to do inbetween assist calls and when you're alone, is to frustrate your opponent into pressing a button.

Dante, by himself, having not already started a combo, has no unreactable mixups outside of landing a throw, which does no damage. The only way your opponent will get hit is if they press a button. Be it they try to attack you when you're out of their range (but in yours,) catching them trying to forward or backdash, baited their advancing guard, or tricked them into teching a throw that doesn't even exist.
So lets go over both methods of offense.

---

**Teleport mixups with assists**

Teleport + Assist is Dante's standard assist mixup. Because Dante will always appear in the same spot however, it can still be somewhat unsafe if your opponent is paying extra attention. This mixup is most often executed after a bold canceled Stinger. Let's talk about what's going on when you do Stinger Teleport without an assist.

**The math on Stinger-&gt;Teleport**

Stinger inflicts 27 frames of blockstun, and Teleport is 22 frames of animation, crossing up on the 12th frame. A stinger BC teleport leaves you +5 in the air, which isn't exactly as advantageous as you would think. Dante's j.M is 10 frame startup, with j.H being 13. Whichever you choose, if you fall immediately with one of these moves, your opponent will still have at least 5 frames to act.

Depending on character height, and if they're crouching or not, instantly falling with a j.M after recovering from teleport will not even connect, leaving you completely open to an air throw. j.H is the better option if you do this, because you will hit crouching characters (which is the point of overhead attacks in the first place.) It is best you hold a direction when you do this so you will option select an air throw into the falling H just in case the opponent escapes (e.g. you hit them airborne and they escape the blockstun.)

Now the problem in doing this *without* an assist is that even though you are at frame advantage, being in the air still puts you in a dangerous position to be air thrown. The fastest possible air throw can be done in 5 frames; 3 to leave the ground, 1 to input the throw, and 1 for the startup. So even being at +7 doesn't leave you completely safe for an immediate j.H. 

**If they pushblock**

Problems occur when opponents start to learn to use advancing guard against Stinger. Pushblocking the Stinger as quickly as possible will *lessen* the blockstun received, and will leave Dante at a greater disadvantage. This is where falling with a j.fwd.H will help protect you from air throw punishes, but not so much anti air attacks.

The timing of the opponents pushblock controls where Dante will appear after the teleport. If your opponent is aware of this, it is very likely they are going to try to either pushblock immediately to lessen the blockstun and punish you, or delay the pushblock until after you teleport, and push you back in front of their character, thus avoiding any left/right mixup and putting you back where you started. 

**Where assists come in**

While it is generally thought that the reason to use assists with teleport is to left/right mixup with the assist itself (which is a perfectly valid mixup,) it isn't as safe as a lot of people would think. If you do this when your opponent isn't in blockstun, you risk having both of your characters damaged. If you do it while they are in blockstun, the opponent can control the outcome of the teleport by pushblocking in the right ways.

If you want to get the assist hit to cross up from a stinger-&gt;BC-&gt;teleport, you need to set up your inputs perfectly.

Ideally, you want your assist to hit as soon as the 27 frames of blockstun end. Stinger is 15 startup, canceling to teleport after 1 active frame (assuming you hit with the first active frame) means your opponent will be free from blockstun 42 frames after the inputted Stinger. Because assists are not affected by point character's hitstop, there's an extra period of time where your assist will continue moving when you and your opponent will not, this is approximately 4-6 frames on Stinger.

This means if you call an assist at the same time your perform a stinger teleport, your assist would have to have about 45 frames of startup (from the moment the assist button is released) to hit at the perfect time to cross up your opponent without any way to jump and throw. Any more or less startup on the assist means you'll have to adjust your assist call timing with your Stinger to get this timing. 

**How this will give you a proper mixup**

Used correctly, asssist+stinger-&gt;teleport will give the opponent an attack to react to. The outcome will always be the same because teleport only has one end point, but if the opponent is not prepared to block, you could get a free hit anyway.

Now here's the big reason why the assist call is key. If the opponent pushblocks your Stinger immediately, you will still be protected from your opponent's quicker recovery. If the opponent attempts to delay their pushblock, your assist will hit first, and you can not be pushed away.

Depending on what assists you use, there can still be a window where the opponent pushblocks you and you end up back in front of them. Depending on what move you fall down with, you'll still hit them. 

*Now* your opponent is in a setup where they must block a mixup. You're above their head, pinned by an assist. Odds are average players didn't even block the assist crossup in the first place, bad players may not have even blocked the Stinger. But now that you're here, now you have an actual mixup to do.

**The mixup**

Now you have a simple left right mixup to play with here. One thing you will need to take into account is your assist is probably going to push your opponent back just enough to where if you land straight down, you will likely land back in front of them. Odds are your opponent isn't ready for this, so just landing and attacking will sometimes be enough to overload the opponent. Alternately, you can use an airdash to better position yourself to whichever side of the opponent you want to hit, depending on how your assist hits them.

Using The Hammer is another option, not only will it keep opponents who may have figured a way to escape your setup in check, but depending on how your assist pushes your opponent, you can get an ambiguous mixup, simply by falling with a j.H or falling with a hammer. Falling with a j.H will get you to the ground quicker, but using The Hammer will keep you in the air, and for some assists, will push your opponent under you, and the hammer will cross up. It's very difficult to react to.

Should either of this options fail and they block your mixup, you will still land with frame advantage. You can use this to attempt an instant air dash cross up,  frame trap, or even throw if you want to give your assist the time to recharge.

LLND will be at my house for the next 5-6 hours and will be answering questions on my account for the rest of the night and beyond.

For those of you who aren't familiar with him, LLND is a Chris / Hsien-Ko / Amaterasu player from SoCal who recently (major-wise) placed 13th at SCR and consistently places into Top 8 at Wednesday Night Fights / whatever other weeklies there are out here.

LLND is an incredibly innovative player; he developed a ton of the Chris technology used in competitive play and is the sole reason that most people in SoCal don't put Hsien-Ko as bottom five.

So go ahead, ask him anything.

The assist lineup was always launcher slam, katanarama, drones. Always drones, they told me. You need drones. Drones are the best assist in the game. You're wasting your time if you're not using drones. Sentinel is just an assist character. That last one I made up.

I always like using an OTG assist with Nemesis. Yeah it's really situational, and only extends combos, but come on. He hits like a fucking truck that's been filled with dirty noodles. You can get an extra 200K easy on your combos just by having an OTG assist. So it was necessary to leave Deadpool on katanarama.

Because you always use drones. Everyone knows that. Everyone knows you only ever use drones.

Well fuck what everyone knows. Today I switched things up. Launcher slam, quick work, rocket punch. Holy Moses. Unblockable setups that I can then have an assist OTG for extension, not to mention that rocket punch does something like 60k more damage than katanarama, has better range, and can be used to effectively slow down incoming rushes. I destroyed my playgroup today. It was beautiful and it was terrible.

So I guess all I'm saying is fuck not doing something in this game just because the general attitude is that you're making a bad call. Try stuff out. See what works. MvC2 made it ten years because people tried unconventional things and learned that their initial impressions of top-tier characters and how to play the game were dead wrong.

Go try something you like because you think it's fun and see if it's awesome. You might be surprised.

**UPVOTE FOR VISIBILITY, I DON'T GET KARMA FOR IT SO HELP EVERYONE OUT BY PUSHING THIS TO THE TOP.**

It's time I stopped doing tournament interest checks and just did it, so here we go. This post will be a bit disorganized as I've got a bunch of ideas kicking around, so bear with me. This will take place over a week or few weeks depending on how many entrants we have. **Read, this is not a one-day tournament**. 

POST WHEN WILL BE GOOD FOR YOU, THINKING OF STARTING SIGNUPS NEXT WEEK.

SIGNUPS WILL TAKE PLACE FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE WEEK, BOTH PLAYERS MUST POST (Player one registers team, player two replies to that post with ""Confirmed"" or something like that).

Easy explanation of Waseda Style, the format in which everyone plays: A1 vs A2, B1 vs B2. If both players from the same team win, it's done. If A1 and B2 win, they play each other. A and B positions are locked to prevent countering (Register your team as A: Player1 / B: Player2)

**SETS WILL BE 2/3 PER PLAYER, NOT PER TEAM**(A1 vs A2 2/3, B1 vs B2 2/3, winners 2/3 if necessary). If you disagree with this, feel free to discuss it.

**DOUBLE ELIMINATION** (Winners and losers brackets)
 
Basic rules so far, no particular order, followed by explanations in parenthesis. **FAILURE TO ABIDE BY ANY OF THESE WILL RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE DQ / ELIMINATION**

* Standard tournament rules as far as time/damage/glitches etc goes. (Pretty straightforward, I feel)
* Nobody with a skull icon (High disconnect rate mark of shame) may enter (Either you're a toxic player or your net is too unreliable for online tournament play).
* TEAMS ARE LOCKED, YOU CAN'T PLAY TEAM DMC ONE MATCH AND MSS THE NEXT MATCH. REGISTER AND STICK TO IT.
* NO 2v2 TEAM MAY HAVE MORE THAN ONE OF THE SAME CHARACTER TWICE! (This is more for the sake of variety. If your team is Dante/Vergil/Magneto, your partner cannot have MORE THAN ONE of those characters on their team)
* You will have 48 hours to play your matches before being DQ'd into losers / eliminated (For the sake of time, I understand not everyone can sit down for a whole day for an online tournament, but I still want this to go quickly enough to not stagnate)
* One player from **each** team must verify results -ALTERNATIVE- one player from either team may submit a replay of the set (In the interest of fairness; if you are caught cheating I **will** ban you from /r/mvc3)
* Prize will be some amount of MSP to each player or some virtual good(s) of equal value, probably first place only unless peole want to donate to the pool. (I will be providing this out-of-pocket because I'm great)
* This will probably be restricted to NA/USA only, sorry EUBros :[ (Online, lag, yadda yadda yadda. Not sure about Canadian connections, need input from some Canucks)
* If a match drops and one player is kicked out of the lobby, that player takes a loss. If not (Mutual drop), replay it. There's no way to determine who's winning 100% reliably since lolmarvel, sadly, so this will be on the honor system (If a trend is seen, your team will be DQ'd)
* Lag issues will need to be discussed in this post.

More to come."	t5_2s01r	True

http://www.twitch.tv/thisislijoe/b/316746479?t=13m00s

http://ecthrowdown.com/?p=1061

Cliff notes:

* Fanatiq thinks RayRay is free to him.
* Believes he has the best Magneto/Sentinel due to better fundementals.
* Wants to money match both RayRay and Joker.
* RayRay joins the conversation, isn't very happy.
* Fanatiq goes into a long winded trash talk.
* Money match is agreed, first to 15, Noel Brown backs RayRay almost immediately.
* Talk of Knives vs Yipes MM also, Fanatiq says he can guarantee Knives will be down to play.
* Both confirm they will be at ECT4 streamed by Spooky (June 9-10).

RayRay is one of my favourite players, but I do somewhat agree with Fanatiq about his comment about fundementals. RayRay generally doesn't do very well when his team is on the defensive for prolonged periods of the match.


As Joe said on the stream, this will probably be the highest MvC3 money match yet by the time ECT4 is upon us. 

Really looking forward to this. It should be amazing."	t5_2s01r	True

+ AlukardNY's newest Skrull combo involving Inferno into relaunch into full combo.

+ Josh Wong owning people with Random person/Doom/Wesker

+ Josh Wong for best Wesker in America.

+ MarlinPie's newest Doom Exchange super swag combos

+ Alukard's Ironman Reverse OCVing people.

+ Alukard vs. Marlinpie #2 SWAG match!

+ And my newest, favorite player, **BASEDSAUSAGE**, with his **Hulk/Phoenix Wright/Rocket Racoon** team, showcasing PW *unblockables* and ""The Real Dark Phoenix""!

Headed to bed, but this tournament was the best break they have had in a long ass time.

Useful for setting up Soul Drain or Command grabs before their active frames of they Hyper.

1322051872.0	mmnno	Weekly Character Discussion (11/23) - Hawkeye.	Dreckerr	33	2	62	"**This will be updated as information is posted**

**For some reason I can't get Input macros to work, probably just me being bad but if anyone could help?**

For the first of our weekly character discussions, let's focus on how to make Hawkeye effective. What are good moves to use with him, approaching tactics, movement options, zoning options, assists, etc. Let's share the info on how to make him effective in a match. How are YOU playing Hawkeye?

In fact, let's spice it up by discussing ways *around* Hawkeye's zoning as well.

**Hawkeye Basic Information**

* 900,000 Health.
* Primary focus - Long-range zoning &amp; Punishment.
* Best Super - Gimlet (QCF+AtkAtk).
* Optimal screen position: Mid to full screen, allowing strong zoning within slide range to punish for full combos.
* Optimal position on teams: Second or Anchor, as Hawkeye requires meter to make himself as scary as possible for Gimlet shenanigans.


**Assists**

* Quick Shot (Greyhound) - Standard beam arrow assist a-la Taskmaster. Useful for setting up tricky crossups and controlling horizontal space. Low end of the projectile durability scale.

* Violent Fizz (Poison) - Light version of Trick Maneuver canceled into Violent Fizz, Hawkeye's Poison DoT. Poison falls off if either Hawkeye or the point character are hit, most useful during combos to add unscaled damage. Comes out slowly.

* Ragtime (Kamikaze) - Controls a ton of vertical space. Works as a miniature faster version of Hidden Missiles, most useful for shutting down air approach and super jumps.

**Misc. Knowledge**

* Has possibly the best slide in the game, cancelable into special moves to make safe.

* You can have more than one Exploding Arrow on the screen at once.

* If you land a Gimlet anywhere on the bottom half of the screen and X-Factor you can follow it up with a full combo immediately.

* X-Factoring Gimlet before the arrow hits the opponent after the move comes out causes it to get the damage bonus (Odd timing).

* Shock Value [Towards+M] is incredibly fast, covers a lot of ground and can OTG. Throw it out to catch people off guard in between arrows.

* Constantly canceling his normals into Trick Maneuver L and using Poison Tip places you at great block advantage and sets up some strong pressure situations.

* Don't forget that his standing H can be aimed up to 45 degrees up or down, and if you change the aim as it fires you can fire the arrows in a spread. It seems like a lot of people don't know this.

* **Gimlet is an omni-directional nearly instant 250k hit that can punish literally anything. Abuse the hell out of it.**

**Basic Hawkeye BnB's**

* c.LM xx Slide xx S, SJ backwards, j.MMHS, Trick Maneuver L xx Ice Arrow, Slide xx S, neutral SJ j.MMHS, Trick Maneuver L into Poison Tip xx Gimlet (Corner combo, Midscreen requires  H Trick Maneuver on the first OTG OR Towards+M [Shock Value]) - ~488,400 plus Poison.

* s.H &gt; QCF+M &gt; s. H &gt; QCF+M &gt; s. H &gt; QCF+M &gt; s. H &gt; qcb M &gt; L &gt; Gimlet - Hunter Loop (s.H is the uncharged arrow). Unsure on damage as I just turned my console off.

Dreckerr	31	3	122	"Hey all, this is a thread idea that's been around on similar gaming subs for months (Most prominent is /r/leagueoflegends with their Monday Megathreads).

Please feel free to ask anything relavent to Marvel or the FGC in general you have questions about. This could range as far as one can imagine; execution tips, terminology, tournament etiquette, the list goes on. **Do not berate people for what asking you think is a stupid question. Something obvious to you is rarely obvious to everyone else.** Use your downvotes sparingly in these threads (If they continue); shitting on people in what's supposed to be a positive environment will not be tolerated by the moderation staff.

The primary purpose of these threads if for more seasoned Marvel / Fighter veterans to share our knowledge with newer players. Of course this doesn't mean experienced players are barred from asking whatever they feel is relavent - there's a shitload I don't know about games I've been playing for over ten years, for example. Don't be afraid to ask what some may deem ""scrubby questions"" - Ask and be answered. 

Also, PLEASE use these threads as a median for deep discussion if you'd like! This isn't a simple ask:answer 1:1 thing! "	t5_2s01r	True

This has included multi snapback combos, Marlinpie's insane Doom maneuvers, and the rare but infamous Skrull stomp.

These combos really get the crowd hyped up and make for some very memorable stream moments. I've been scouring random streams and youtube videos searching for moments like the ones I've just described, but I'm not having much luck.

I've been speaking with Paul ""Koogy"" Kugler for a short while now about getting an AMA going and he's really interested. For those of you who don't know what BROKENTIER is, it's (in the most basic sense) an independent clothing line based on arcade / fighting game culture. For some more information on BROKENTIER and Koogy, [click this link to be taken directly to their website!](http://www.brokentier.com/pages/about)

BROKENTIER's success really shows what happens when you take your passion to the next level and is one of the best examples of ""from the community for the community"". Koogy and his staff aren't in this for money; they funnel a TON of their profit back into the community through individual player sponsorship, event sponsorship and countless other ways.

Please, use this opportunity to really learn from someone who turned their love of fighting games into something like this. It really goes to show what passion and drive can do.

I know many people don't use these because it's quicker/easier to type:

so whatever.

We can discuss the character with possible assists, positions, and team combinations; cover it all. If this takes off, we could make it a weekly discussion.

Just got these 4 titles myself today so I'll give some confirmations and explain how I got them.

I got these offline in Arcade mode Very Easy-Highest Damage. You may be able to get them online as well but I havent tried that.

I havent been able to unlock the space one but I did play in both Asgards and Galactus stage using Captain America's 4th, Hawkeye's 5th, and Thor's 5th or Ironman's 3rd but still havent figured it out so if anyone knows I'd appreciate it! :D

I used the wiki to reference the costumes to make things a little easier: http://marvelvscapcom.wikia.com/wiki/Alternate_Costumes

Once you have met the requirements by winning on that stage you can exit AFTER the next match starts...(I did it that way to make sure)


**Title: But That's Not Me!**
 **Unlock Condition**: Win a match using three costumes inspired by a different character than the one selected.
**Stage:** SHADOWLAND
**Team Used:** Hulk's 4th, She-Hulk's 6th, and Captain America's 6th


**Title:** Days of Future Past
**Unlock Condition:** Win a Days of Future Past match using 3 character costumes inspired by Age of Apocalypse or Age of X.
**Stage:** DAYS OF FUTURE PAST
**Team Used:** Phoenix's 6th, Captain America's 3rd, and Hulk's 5th

**Title:** WHAT IF I'M EXILED?
**Unlock Condition:** Win using 3 costumes inspired by EXILES or WHAT IF? comics while fighting in a Capcom stage.
**Stages:** BONNE WONDERLAND, KATTELOX ISLAND, DEMON VILLAGE REDUX, DEMON VILLAGE, CHAOS AT TRICELL, TRICELL LABORATORY, or METRO CITY
**Team Used:** Dormammu's 5th, M.O.D.O.K's 3rd, and Iron Fist's 6th

**Title:** Ultimate Defiance
**Unlock Condition:** Win a match using three characters whose outfits are inspired by Marvel's Ultimate Universe.
**Stage:** Any
**Team Used:** Hawkeye's 4th, She-Hulk's 4th, Thor's 4th

Since some of you guys are on PS3 or I cant get on when you're on to swap tech, I decided to make a master guide, of sorts, for all Iron Man. Included is a video I made myself to fill the last details I thought were missing.

Below are some key videos and sites that helped me get better. You can always check forums for info, and there are many other videos for Iron Man strategy, but this is consolidated nicely and hits each subject.

General Guide for Iron Man

[This has all of the basic for new players to Iron Man.](http://wiki.shoryuken.com/Ultimate_Marvel_vs_Capcom_3/Iron_Man)

Combos

[A lot of good combos with great explainations.](http://youtu.be/IXvaIoc-C-s)

Resets

[Important tech for after combos.](http://youtu.be/tMZlQwW3D3s)

[Another Nice Combo into Reset thanks to Abbernathy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gELpl7GZxqA)

Repulsor Technology

[This video covers how good Iron Man's Repulsor Blast really is.](http://youtu.be/09gE_7mi7mI)

Air to Air Conversions and Combos

[Important information to continue pressure on the opponent from anywhere on the screen.](http://youtu.be/klr9AmHYdeg)

Iron Man Gameplay Strategies

[My video explaining how to initiate combos and apply pressure.](http://youtu.be/BaItKo3qghE)

Team Air Combos

[Once you get comfortable with the other tech, it is time to add TACs to complete your game.](http://youtu.be/sWnZ5RUQwbU)

Here are some notable Iron Man players to watch:

[Joker](http://youtu.be/ftGFKWaatXg)
is a great Iron Man player that shows off Repulsor Swag.


[Danke](http://youtu.be/nlQwD0zhV6I)
is a crafty Iron Man player that has good strategy. He loses these matches, but Danke displays efficient ways to move and attack with Iron Man.

[Alukard](http://youtu.be/Qng0kOoebqg)
is a well known Iron Man player that goes up against some of the best players in the country and still uses Tony.


For my video, some of the ideas came from my own experience and others came from these links.

Props for the other videos goes to their respective poster, video maker, and/or player. I do not claim to have invented their technology, but posted them here for the benefit of others who have undertaken the struggle of mastering Tony. A big thanks to them for pushing Iron Man's potential further.

I leave the rest open for discussion. Feel free to link other great videos, ask any questions, and please no hate/trolls.

Also, sorry for the wall of links.

1321556025.0	mfy8c	For those of you considering buying the Umvc3 Brady Guide DO IT (Here's why).	StaneNC	30	5	44	"I was a pretty big fan of the first one. The technology quickly became outdated and the tips seemed obvious, but that thing was constantly open and useful when I had people over even into the more recent months.

**THIS NEW GUIDE IS 100X BETTER**

* Clockw0rk is one of the authors
* tournament-quality combos (no pansy shit)
* extremely in-depth guides to general character strategies
* intro section before the characters is 60 pages of game info **META GAME EVOLUTION OF VANILLA**, glossary as usual, specific details about when assists can be called, jumping frame data, dashing rates, soooo much information.
* vanilla version = 390ish pages, Ultimate has 588.
* each character has tons of insight. 10ish pages full of frame data, tips attacks and strategies used, combos for every situation (XF cancels, air-throws, ground throws, AA, etc). 

Basically, you won't need youtube for a while to figure shit out.
[C. Viper's combo page(shitty picture to avoid copyright stuff)](http://i.imgur.com/qcpjT.png) (notice that the first combo on the page is the 2nd combo in the list)

Things to notice:

* Not combos for bitches
* technique guide for execution (I wish I had somewhere to tell me to delay the air MMH as she hulk in order to get the OtG on time a few months ago)
* combos start on different attacks, no bullshit about having a different special inserted for another and calling it a different combo.
* Meter gain or loss after the combo (especially useful for choosing which Chi to use as Iron Fist, or developing combos that have 100% meter gain after to allow for a free DHC)
* thorough explanation under every combo


And if you haven't been convinced, the guide was 15 bucks (20 without discount), which put my purchase at $61.XX. AKA the cost of a new game. Basically, capcom gave you a free, amaaaazing guide. I hope I convinced a few. Leave any questions below if you're still not convinced or think you can help convince others, or just throw an up-vote up there to help spread the awesome.

So basically, AMA about Strange. Allow me to articulate. I'm pretty sure I know enough about the character, and I need to be sure before I write anything major. So ask tough questions. Grace formations, Illusion dashes, mid-flight flame modifications, safe strings, whatever your heart desires.

1362584669.0	19s2lo	Since we're talking about tier charts, here's a chart I've been working on for the past week, focusing more on how characters rank in team synergy and needs rather than 1v1 strengths.	Evil_Toaster	29	4	45	"**[Here's the chart](http://i.imgur.com/C9Pfihp.jpg)**

Here's how I define each angle of the chart.

**Strong Asset:** Characters that bring valuable tools to the team. That can be anything from a good DHC, an effective TAC, a useful THC, unblockable setups, or just a great assist or anchor capabilities.

**Liability:** These are characters that could have a ""problem."" Carry characters, immobile characters, characters that need more meter to do respectable damage, etc. **This does not mean the character is a ""bad"" character,** it only means they can bring a team down, and require special attention.

**Independent:** These are characters that are good on any team, or characters that are good even without assists. Even if they ""need"" assists, almost any assist will be helpful. These characters can do big damage without assists, are meter efficient, and have enough tools to survive on their own.

**Reliant:** These characters need their team. The more reliant, the more specific needs they have (i.e., needing a specific team mate to be viable.)

---

[](/twipoker)Honestly, I still don't think this is the best way to define character rankings, but I think it's a step closer. I don't think it can be done on a 2D plane, or at least not just one.

Also, there's some characters that could easier fit two sides of the same axis. For example, Phoenix is a liability to any team, that's a fact. However, if you work for her, she becomes a great asset. Strider is strong enough to play alone, but to compete with the rest of the cast, he needs specific characters. It's a weird balance, and as far as the extremes go, it's hard to decide. But I did the best I could.

1323908725.0	nd341	Bi-Weekly Character Discussion: Doctor Doom!	Dreckerr	27	1	45	"Based on the number of votes received, **Doctor Doom** will be our discussion character for the next few days!
What are good moves to use with him, how do you approach with Doom, what are your zoning options, movement abilities, best assist choices, when to Foot Dive etc. What do you use to control space, what kind of mixups, resets and personal gimmicks do you have? Let’s share information on how to make Doom the most effective character he can be.

**Doctor Doom**

* 1,000,000 Health.

* Mashable Hypers: Photon Array, Air Photon Array, Doom Time.

* Primary Focus: Force your opponent into the corner with midscreen combos and strong projectile game, where your already damaging midscreen combos become even more deadly. Also, fishing for hits with Air S Foot Dive for hard knockdowns, guaranteeing a full combo from standing H.

**Assists**

* Plasma Beam - One of  the best beam assists in the game. Crushes many other projectiles, lots of blockstun, great for crossups off side-switching shenanigans.

* Hidden Missiles – Shoots off 6 tracking OTG-capable missiles (That persist even if Doom is hit) that follow the opponent, cause a decent amount of blockstun and force the opponent to block or they’ll get knocked out of their combos and give you some free damage.

* Molecular Shield (Rocks) – Damages opponents at point blank range fairly quickly, then moves across the screen at a moderate pace. Controls a lot of space.

**Misc Knowledge**

* Doom cannot cancel his normal dash into anything, has no wavedash, but has a great triangle jump. Mastering his triangle jump (Jump forward &gt; airdash down-forward) is 100% necessary to playing Doom.

* Doom has great air mobility, he can start and stop on a whim. Learn the trajectory of Foot Dive Towards+H and S, as both are great approaches and are cancellable into flight.

* Air M has a deceptively large hitbox, use it to hold off approaches, use it as an assault tool as it’s cancellable immediately into towards+H, airdash down-forward, air M, land and keep going.

* Empty Tri-Jumps into low L are fantastic for starting offense, since Doom can airdash so low to the ground this catches many people off guard, especially when crossing up smaller characters.

* Tri-Jump Air M (superjump &gt; airdash down-forward+M) convers the most range of all doom’s tri/square dash options. 

* Doom can cancel grounded basic attacks into ground dashes immediately, and is the only character able to. If opponents are heavy on advance guards, dash cancel in and blow them up.

* Ground Dash is jump cancellable, abuse this.

* Brady Guide: “If an opponent guards cr.L, cr.H, cancel cr.H into a forward dash and the forward dash into a normal jump forward, airdash down forward low L

**Helpful Videos**

Everything looked right (the page for twitch.tv in the background, the pop-up prompt to update in the foreground) but something didn't quite feel right, so I directed away from the page, and found the page was attempting to convince me to stay. I immediately realized something was wrong and got away clean. It's obviously a trap that will either charge you money or infect your computer. Just wanted to spread the word. Not sure if anyone has talked about yet, or suffered from this site. I use Twitch for watching Starcraft 2 and League of Legends, so I figured I'd share this, just in case it helps a few people.""

Nova: Energy Javelin is an OTG as well as a groundbounce.

In XF3 after an airthrow, you can land, energy javelin, then do Nova Punch H into combo (least that's what I do in certain screen positions when it's optimal)

Without XF, if you land a airthrow (normal jump height mainly), right after the throw, quickly dash downward and cancel the dash with a.H to land faster. Once on the ground, you can dash up and c.M into whatever combo.

Now this can easily be avoided by just doing Cent Rush L but I enjoy this instead.

Edit: If this is done on a corner character instead, you'll simply hit with the a.H and will be able to combo with s.M, s.H into your standard BnB so you can skip the Energy Javelin.

Viper: Now no one believes me on this but Viper's Burst time or otg super is a low hitting super.

It is also the only super that can beat Zero's Genmu Zero (level 3 hyper) in projectile durability and cancel it out.

Yes, the invincibility frames would beat it normally but to prove it, just do a team hyper super after a Genmu Zero, and Viper will protect her teammates.

However, the Hughes brothers have a huge backlog of orders for the dual modded hitbox (not slated to start delivery on dual mods until September) and the cost of thier brand of Dual Modded Hitboxes will be between $180-$250 D:

So, since there was going to be a nice wait on the product, and the fact that the cost of the product was going to be very high, I decided to go ahead and make my own. This way, I could see if I really wanted to use the product to begin with.

""Finished"" product:

http://i.imgur.com/BuzcY.jpg

Note: This thing is definitely a work in progress. Furthermore, I learned that working with plexiglass is not as easy as I thought that it'd be (stupid thing melts when you try to cut it with a dremel :( )

Tools used:

+ A Dremel with Multipurpose cutting Bit and Sanding bits
+ A WWE Brawlstick ($50)
+ Some Extra 30mm Sanwa buttons (yay!) plus some leftover brawl stick buttons (boo!)
+ Some [Quick Disconnects](http://www.lizardlick.com/Crimp-Connectors_c_203.html)
+ Some 22 gauge speaker wire
+ Plexiglass from Home Depot

So, the first thing that I did was open the WWE Brawl Stick (which is just a rebranded Street Fighter/Mad Catz SE stick) by removing the bottom screws:

+ http://i.imgur.com/28Lqb.jpg

Next, I took a picture of the internal wiring of the stick so I knew where everything was going to go back to just in case

+ http://i.imgur.com/hnmcY.jpg

From there, I removed the crappy Brawl stick joystick by inserting a screwdriver into the c-clamped screw beneath the stick, and then unscrewing the ball top from the other end of the stick.

From there disconnecting the stick is easy -- there is a connector that attaches to the stick that is only lightly glued in place. Wiggle it a bit, and it will come off.

+ http://i.imgur.com/VSNvq.jpg

After that, I removed all buttons. As you can see in this photo, there is still a little bit of glue on the connector from the rear terminal board to the Joystick.

+ http://i.imgur.com/PfnMI.jpg


At this point, I also removed screws for the start/back button as well as the home/turbo selection PCB.

+ http://imgur.com/7SlJu.jpg

From there just before I took the turbo/Home button PCB out, I scraped in the corner near it to gain access to the laminated artwork on the stick since it had to be removed...

+ http://i.imgur.com/wzvwe.jpg

...to gain access to the 5 screws on the aluminum case top. 

+ http://i.imgur.com/AFVt0.jpg

I removed these screws to completely open the case since I was going to replace the top with ""new"" plexiglass

+ http://i.imgur.com/E1LhD.jpg

Next, I put the metal case top in my scanner

+ [Scanned pic](http://imgur.com/gly41.jpg)

Manipulated it to remove the hole for the joystick. MSPAINT FTW!:

+ [Scanned pic, no joystick.](http://i.imgur.com/FKojV.jpg)

And then finally I flipped three of the button holes from one side to the other to make the left, down, right holes, and copied a single on over to make the up hole (remember, UP is separated from the other buttons). Ghetto, yes I know, but I just wanted to make my own proof of concept.

+ [Final picture.](http://i.imgur.com/aCEQO.jpg)

I then printed this out and used it as a template for the plexiglass.

Since I had never in my life worked with plexiglass, those pictures were deleted due to how completely embarrassing ,my first few tries were. Hell, the final picture above was my best work, and it still turned out crappy. I am eventually going to revisit cutting plexiglass, but for now, I am done with thee!

Also of note, I should have used a drill with some routing bits, but I do not own one, so Dremel it was :(

+ http://i.imgur.com/YeYzB.jpg

So, I cut out what I needed and then placed it on the plastic case. After looking at it, I realized that some buttons would have been blocked by the plastic, so I had to make a few cuts to it to have all of the buttons fit.

+ http://i.imgur.com/qi1fw.jpg

+ http://i.imgur.com/6taor.jpg

Here is the semi finished product. 

+ http://i.imgur.com/kP6XF.jpg

Here are the button checks to make sure that all of the buttons fit

+ [Case with buttons inserted, un-wired.](http://imgur.com/Kh74U.jpg&lt;/a&gt;)

From there, using the picture from before as a guide I re-wired back all the attack buttons.

+ http://i.imgur.com/p1Q9D.jpg

Here is a picture of the PCB that contains the controls for the Joystick. It went Ground, Right, Left, Up, Down. I labeled each wire, and then cut off the connect that would have went into a joystick.

+ [PCB of Joystick](http://i.imgur.com/iNbDx.jpg)

Each Button has an Input, and ground (common) connector to it. Since each input needed that common, I created a daisy chain...

+ [Daisy chain](http://i.imgur.com/ZNrGU.jpg)

...that I connected all the directional buttons to. I wish I had also inserted a barrier strip so as to clean up everything in the case and make it look *purdy*, but for now ghetto daisy chain.

+ [Totally unfocused horrible internal wiring complete picture](http://i.imgur.com/huZi5.jpg)

Finally I put everything together...

+ [Final Picture](http://i.imgur.com/Poihj.jpg)

...But it was not until I started playing MVC3 for testing did I notice something: because I did a direct copy and flip of the first three attack buttons in making my template, the LEFT button is further away from the DOWN button than the RIGHT button. This actually makes left sided attack motions harder since I now have to use my pinky instead of my ring finger. Just another thing on a series of things that I have to take care of at a later time.

So, how does it play? Other than the left sided snafu, I actually like this, though in the pictures the directional buttons were all standard issue Madcatz buttons. These Brawl stick buttons may not be bad for attack buttons, but for movement, they sucked donkey dick so I went back in and inserted my last four SANWA buttons into the directionals. 

I am still having issues doing double jump combos with certain people in Mission Mode (Dante and Arthur) but I am almost back to normal with my team of She-Hulk, Crimson Viper, and Spencer, where surprisingly it was Spencer that I took awhile to get readjusted to on the GHB.

I am still playing through against the computer, doing mission mode, and playing friends that come over, but I am not comfortable yet going online because I still have to *think* to jump instead of just jumping.
