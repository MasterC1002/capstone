1347061970.0	zj6c9	I want to learn how to stop procrastinating	greendaze	1922	532	648	"My procrastination has been getting worse for the past few years. 

Nowadays, if I have an assignment due at midnight on the day of, I will literally waste my time on the internet as the hours count down until I panic enough to start the work. 

If the assignment is not due the day of, I still waste all of my time on the internet (with breaks in between for meals and washroom breaks) while telling myself that it's fine, I'll totally start doing it tomorrow. 

As you can imagine, this means that I get almost no studying done until tests/exams come along, which you might think would galvanize me into cramming...but no. I just keep procrastinating, albeit, in a more stressed mindset. My marks have reflected the amount of work I put into school, which is to say, very low.

Online (By mistake if you would believe it), through other girls I've dated, by mistake (seeing a trend here?), or in grade school (8th through 12th if it matters).  I've never actually met a girl, expressed interest, and successfully taken them out on a date to get to know them, and try to maybe start some sort of relationship after a period of time.  After getting out of an engagement about 9 months ago, I've found myself dead in the water, so to speak, when it comes to meeting girls with similar interests, expressing an interest, and actually going on a date.  Seriously, 22 years old, never gone on a real date. 

I want to learn how to actually meet women, start a conversation with them, and start dating, without making myself look like some guy in a bar trying to get laid.

1314922522.0	k1w38	IWTL to rid myself of this cocktail of mild depression, social/general anxiety, procrastination, self-consciousness, lethargy, laziness and my general lack of motivation	ceilingdweller	338	34	102	"This isn't a rant about how shit my life is. I swear. I basically feel that there's just some underpinning ""trick"" that I'm not getting to all of this life business. I'm incredibly anxious and self-conscious and I'm a horrible procrastinator. I feel tired nearly all the time and my diet sucks. I always get a slight motivational kick when I go and post a few questions on r/askreddit, but then never follow through with applying the answers. There's so much that I want to do - discover more music, read more, get a girlfriend, study harder, get in shape.... And the flip side is I feel incredibly anxious about all of that stuff because I feel like I'm missing all these brilliant opportunities, and I just build more of this self-inflicted mental pressure. But when the times comes to do these things or organise myself, a sense of lethargy takes over and I sometimes just fall asleep instead. I have never had one of those ""I will plan to do x better/more efficiently at date y"" plans actually pull through, I always get sidetracked and keep telling myself that it will be different in a few months time when I find my feet, but it never is. I don't know any tricks to overcome this motivational struggle. I'll leave things until the very last minute and then become an anxious wreck trying to get them done in time. I'll always plan to address a certain problematic aspect of my personality by going on reddit and doing some research to beat procrastination, for example, but I never follow through with any of it. I spend hours on the internet everyday and waste my life thinking that I'm taking a step in the right direction by looking at informative reddit posts. I'll save 4 dozen pages of lifehacks and never read them again or download 50 documentaries and watch them very ocassionally etc. etc. etc.....  

Does anyone have any advice that will really make a difference for a case such as mine? I keep imagining going to see some sort of ""life organisation"" specialist could help me, but I'd never follow through with it. Does anybody out there have any advice for a case such as mine? And before the shit storm of posts saying ""It's simple: Just do it"", it's really not that simple. It just isn't. I need motivation to get these things done and everything I've tried thus far hasn't worked... Can anybody throw me some nuggets of advice? 
I'm desperate :/

I'll repost this on as many subreddits as I have to to get some answers.....

Edit 1: This is my first step. A baby step it is, but a step nonetheless. I was going to procrastinate adding this section until I've read all the comments in depth and responded to them appropriately. That would have taken a while. I'm adding it now anyways and I'll get around to responding to all the interesting ideas. I'm adding this to the original post to thank all of you for the feedback and advice. I get the impression that there are alot of you who are concerned by matters like this. Maybe it's because this is you, or someone you used to be. I got a few things done today. I sent a few emails to prepare for going back to college and contacted a few people. I had millions of other things that I was planning to do today, but I've decided I'm not going to beat myself up about it, like I would have done before. I'm giving myself credit for the little that I did do today; taking it one step at a time. I'm feeling more motivated and hopeful about the whole situation now. I'm going to keep this post as a reference and tomorrow I'm going to get a pen and paper and write down all the important shit that you guys put down here. I hope others can benefit from this and keep the advice coming. "	t5_2rjo5	True

As many of you know, there was a good deal of drama today surrounding the /r/IAmA subreddit. Basically, the guy who started that subreddit decided that he didn't want to deal with it anymore, and therefore it should be shutdown entirely. He removed all of the other moderators, and called it a day.

As expected with a subreddit of over 400,000 users (Yes, close to *half a million* subscribers), there was quite a lot of backlash. I'm fuzzy on the details, but I know that appeals were made to the reddit admins to have this guy removed as a moderator, and for them to reinstate the other former mods. 

The admins have always been pretty clear on the powers of mods and creators, and try to stay out of internal business where possible. If there is a clear owner of a reddit, then what happens in that reddit is up to them. If they want to go crazy and ban everyone from the place, add custom CSS to turn the whole thing neon green, and spam the reddit all day long with pictures of household sponges, that's their prerogative. It's batshit insane, sure, but they're within their rights to do it. This means that the admins wouldn't step in, and in the end other users had to convince the ""owner"" to let the other kids play again.

Hopefully, something like this will never happen to IWTL. I might make some weird mistakes from time to time, but I try to correct them. I think I've only banned three people from IWTL in the year and a half it has existed, and the **vast** majority of what I do here is to clean out IWTLs that have been wrongly flagged by the spam filter. I'm pretty sure that's true of the other mods as well, since I can see the posts they've removed and I can't remember a time I've disagreed.

Still, I'm not immune from egotism and outright insanity, so I wanted to write out a sort of ""living will"" for IWTL:

Admins, if there comes a time when I go crazy and start ragebanning people for no rational reason, or I demod everyone else and try to shut down IWTL altogether, or if I change the CSS to neon green and start posting sponge pictures all day, feel free to have me demodded, leaving Azemute in charge.

IWTL is good people doing good work, helping others become better at the things they want to learn to do. I'm really proud of what IWTL has become, and I don't want a temporarily insane version of me to be able to ruin it."	t5_2rjo5	True

I've seen his paychecks. He told me the other day he wanted to become an attorney because the rest of his family is successful. He did not want to become the black sheep of the family. So he became an attorney.

But now he is miserable doing his job. My goals are not to become like him. I would rather be able to get by on money and like what I do than being wealthy and hating my job.

I'm so confused right now on what I should do for my career. I can't work warehouse jobs forever. I need to make a decision quick. Since no degree just a high school diploma, 31 years old and with my son on the way and Sallie Mae calling me to make a payment. I need to be in school in order for the Sallie Mae loans to be deferred. I have to do a online degree. Since my job I never know when I will be leaving, son on the way and a few other life issues. That's why I need to make a decision quick.

The only thing I can think of is to write things down on what I like to do and what I don't like to do. What I do know is that I'm more of a indoor desk job type of person. Not a working outdoors in all kinds of elements type of guy.

Contract420	303	71	103	"Especially since/when I am in the right and/or could physically dominate them if it devolved that far. It's foundationless anxiety and I want it gone. I also don't want to have to get into a lot of confrontation to get used to it so it doesn't bother me.

Edit: Thank you all very much for the attention and responses this has generated. I really hate to say it, but maybe there just is no solution. I have been a Buddhist for years so the concept of breathing and meditation are no stranger to me. I am 31 years old and have been involved in some form of martial arts since I was in third grade, although I have no certification in any one of them, my belt is, according to the old definition, dirty from experience and would consider it black. I've been weight lifting for five years and climbing for two. This is not what I would call a chronic problem because, other than last night when it happened again, I cannot remember the last time I shook from confrontation due to my constant effort to avoid it. 

Perhaps background might help: Where I work, I am the only person in my position and sometimes the service I provide gets backed up. Last night a co-worker did not realize that their order was at the bottom of my list due to confusion and when they came to inquire about it they were extremely worked up and aggressive because it put them in a position of stress. I was calm and collected in my responses to their questions, but when they walked away my hands were shaking violently as well as the rest of me. I calmly observed it and used breathing to steady it. It was almost like it wasn't even a part of me. I stood back inside my mind and looked at the trembling as a frustrating curiosity because it had no reason to be there whatsoever. I guess what I'm really asking is: How do I prevent it from happening in the first place during a random event?

**tl;dr a co-worker got worked up over confusion about their order and they got verbally aggressive. Even though I was in the right and had no reason to be and was not mentally anxious, I was still shaking. Is there a way to prevent it instead of waiting for it to happen and controlling it?**

Even if not, I'm hoping this thread helped another person or two :) Upvotes for all.

I'm familiar with off the shelf computer hardware and can build computers and setup networks and all that stuff with stuff I buy.

What I want is to build a functioning CPU out of transistors wires and all that. So designing the logic gates and everything from the ground up.

I fully expect this to be a large project that will take lots of time, but I would like to build one that I can run a full software stack on it and output to a display (I don't intend to build the display).

So I figure I will need to build several types of ""chips"" and hook them all together to make it a functioning computer.

I remember seeing a while back someone who wired up a working computer from scratch and it was huge and had tons of wire. This is pretty much exactly what I want to do.

So if anyone has any experience with anything like this I would appreciate pointers in the right direction.

If I think about a song, I can hear the percussion, brass, strings, winds, polysynth, wub-wubs, drops, high-hats, everything.  I can create a beautiful symphony in my mind, but I have extreme difficulty actually realizing my music upon something more than just what I can hear internally.  What I would like is a good, free, music editing format that can speed up the process of what I'm trying to put into a song.  However, those two adjectives are almost never found within the same product, so I would like some options.  I would be eternally grateful if someone could start me on my way with my 'hobby' music writing, because there are many songs I would like to compose.  I taught myself how to play piano, and by that I mean I'm amateur at best and I can't read music.  I understand the concepts of chords, harmony, melody, but not majors/minors aka nitty stuff.

My knowledge in both genres is pretty weak. I can't tell one jazz song from the next, or if it's a super complex piece or not. I went to a jazz bar one night and felt like some sort of poser. The audience seemed to really enjoy certain sections of the songs that were played. It all sounded the same to me. I hear jazz is really difficult to play, why is that? 

Same thing with classical, if a song's titled Symphony no. 8 in C Minor, I have no idea what that means. I don't know enough about it to tell if the piece is played well or not.

So Reddit, I was wondering if someone could explain the ins and outs of both genres to me. This would include the lingo, and what I should be listening for.

1334872587.0	sij6k	IWTL How to become drunk-me without drinking	Jaydn	204	36	96	"Hello ladies and gentlemen

21 y/o male here. 

As many of you will know, people change when they are drunk/tipsy. Some become fun people, some become assholes and some stay the same.

Now, I've come to notice that drunk-me, he's where it's at. I love it. No problems talking to people, entertaining my friends, no problem at all.
When I'm sober this doesn't come nearly as easy, rather close to impossible. Fun/talkative drunk-me is shy/anxious sober-me.

Easy solution: Drink.

While I have been doing for the last months, it's become kind of a problem. The amout of alcohol I have to consume is large. Always has been. But lately the repercussions of drinking have been more severe and I don't dare to drink 2 nights in a row because of fear for my stomach/health. Painful stomach ache after drinking is probably pretty bad.

Hard solution: Become drunk-me without alcohol or other health-hazards.

I mean it. I tried to do it, going out without drinking, but I get bored faster than I want and the nights are just not that fun.

I want a personality edit. How can I 'remove' my shyness from my persona, become outgoing and all that without needing drugs?

1337005732.0	tmha3	IWTL how to build a memory palace	sjmarotta	180	26	34	"*********************

**UPDATE:**

Thanks to everyone who helped me with this! I took a lot of advice from all of you and also utilized some of the web-link resources you sent me.

Two days ago I built a memory palace. It was fantastic and I used it to memorize the order of *two* randomly shuffled decks of cards!

Yay!

Yesterday I woke up and spent 10 minutes looking at a new deck of cards. I looked through them *once* and was able to memorize *all but 2* of the cards in the right order!

**Thank you all again so much!** This was super fun!

********************************

**Some tips I feel I might give, now:**

* Using smells:

&gt; I made four of the cards smell like things. I imagined myself picking the card up and smelling the back of it. It smelt like strawberries. Then I turned the card over and saw that it was the J of Clubs. From then on, when I was in that part of the palace, if I wasn't sure what the next card was, I just had to pick it up and ""smell"" it, then I remembered exactly what it was!

* Using pains

&gt; A friend of mine mentioned that you can imagine that the first card is poking you in the head, this is the 3 of Hearts, say. Then the next card is scratching your cheek, this one is the 7 of spades. then when you want to go back and remember the orders just remember the pains. I didn't use this technique, but I imagine that it works pretty well, from what worked for me yesterday, so I'm going to try it I think.

* Using annoyances, or frustrations

&gt; In one part of my memory palace I walk past a TV that is blinking a card with an annoying beeping noise in the back-ground. I don't like this noise so I walk into the kitchen where there is a cup with a card on the outside of it. I drink something out of this cup, and it is a card. It makes me sick, so I throw up on the floor, and I notice that the tiles of the cloor onto which I vomit are all the shape of another card.

This worked pretty well for me.

Thanks again, all!

*******************

**Original Post:**

The memory palace is an anchient technique used still today by champions of memory competitions who report only having average memories, and who have been tested to have only average intelligences. This technique allows its users to memorize extra-ordinary and comlex lists of numbers, names, poems, and more.

**Some research:**

&gt; [What is a memory palace?](https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;gs_nf=1&amp;tok=Wo1_EvhaeW80kSEhpHV7dg&amp;cp=9&amp;gs_id=q&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=memory+palace&amp;pf=p&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;oq=memory+pa&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=g4&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=1&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=616&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;cad=b) **(**Or: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci)**)**

I first read about this technique in a Salman Rushdie novel ([*The Enchantress of Florence*](http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=salman+rushdie&amp;sts=t&amp;tn=the+enchantress+of+florence&amp;x=0&amp;y=0))

* **Anybody with personal experience and advice on how to start and how to make it work?**

&gt; I'd like to talk to someone with experience who can coach me through my first attempts to use this technique.

I just read this bestof http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/nxdzz/im_not_as_smart_as_i_thought_i_was/c3d91jl and it definitely slapped me in the face.  The biggest thing that stuck out for me was this:
&gt; You got A's because you studied or because the classes were easy. You got a B probably because you were so used to understanding things that you didn't know how to deal with something that didn't come so easily. I'm guessing that early on you built the cognitive and intellectual tools to rapidly acquire and process new information, but that you've relied on those tools so much you never really developed a good set of tools for what to do when those failed. 

Everything has come rather easily for me, and when it doesn't, i get frustrated very easily.  I started the semester out reading Hobbes, Locke, Plato, and John Stuart Mill.  I did alright, but i had trouble actually understanding the arguments and *thinking* philosophically.  My question is simple: how can i go about studying such texts.  After I finish this post, i'll be starting Marx's Communist Manifesto.  I try to use a pen to underline and make brackets around the stuff i think is important, but i feel like i'm even doing that poorly.  I just kind of underline whatever i think might help me write a paper later.  When it comes to writing an argument paper, i think i do an alright job.  My problem is simply studying and understanding the concepts and like i said, *thinking philosophically*.  My professor said we should be able to do so by the end of the semester, but what can i do to really get started doing so?

**Edit:** I'm fairly new to reddit, lurked for a long time, finally started posting.  New question- why would people downvote this? I'm not trying to sound whiny, but instead trying to figure out if it's the way i posted (or something along those lines- being something i can control) or if people just don't like philosophy.

**Edit #2**  Everyone mentions i need to be questioning what the author says.  I'm having trouble doing so.  I'm so used to being taught facts, i read everything as if it's true.

&gt;&gt;IWantToLearn is meant to help people who are looking for help starting a major project or learning a new skill.  I recently wanted help learning to play the guitar.  I've played for years and thought reddit would probably have a lot of resources for me to use so I did a search.  I found [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/bcp7j/iwtl_how_to_play_guitar/).  Since finding the subreddit I have found a lot of things I'd like to do that I never realized I wanted to do before. Check [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/e36i9/iwtl_lets_make_a_list_of_frequentlyrequestedtopics/) for their frequently requested topics.  This is one of my ""go-to"" subs when I'm looking for a good read.  I advise the ones of you who are interested in learning something new everyday go check it out.  You won't regret it!


&gt;&gt;So let's celebrate this subreddit!  /IWantToLearn is **AWESOME**!!










##AgentConundrum##
=======================================================================

IWantToLearn (IWTL) came from my own desire to learn a martial art. It was a bit of a passing thought, and one that recurs from time to time, but whenever it comes up I end up dismissing it as being too hard to know what to try. I have cousins who have done karate, which seems to traditionally have a lot of mind share, and friends who have been involved with other martial arts, but I never knew which way would be right for me and my goals.

I thought that one way to solve my problem would be to reach out to the reddit community and see what their thoughts were on the subject, and hopefully I'd be able to find my path. Ultimately, I was unsure if AskReddit was the right place to turn, and I abstracted my specific question into a more generalized ""How do I do &lt;x&gt;?"" and realized that, like DoesAnybodyElse, this could be a whole class of AskReddit questions which is better served by having a dedicated subreddit.

One criticism I've repeatedly seen for IWTL is the idea that all this information is already out there, and you just need to ask Google and they'll send you where you need to go. While this is generally true, I find that a lot of the time you'll end up either on an eHow type site - a site which I've heard criticised many times as being a bit of a lowest common denominator content farm - which gives you a fairly broad solution to a specific issue, or you'll find something like the loads of programming blogs which mean well, but can contain subtle errors which can lead a young developer down a very wrong path to internalizing some very bad habits.

Searching on Google for information on a subject seems like an odd way to learn a new topic, since you're basically guessing at what you should search for, with only a tentative grasp on the subject and therefore not knowing the full breadth of the topic, leaving you prone to missing large chunks of a subject. By contrast, declaring on a reddit submission, ""I want to learn how to &lt;x&gt;, and this is where I am in terms of finding my way"" seems like a great way to find gaps in your knowledge. You're allowing the community to tell you how they learned the subject, they can educate you on areas of interest you may not have known existed, and they can warn you about various fallacies and other pitfalls you might run into. These people have the benefit of having once been in your shoes, and they have the experience to guide you. It also opens up a conversation between a learner and a variety of teachers - two way communication - where poking at Google can be a very one sided affair.

So that's how IWTL was born; I'll leave it to xtirpation to fill you in on more of the day-to-day stuff, since I think he's a lot more involved in the community these days than I am. I still feel like IWTL is my baby, and I still check the spam/reported queues to make sure things aren't getting lost in the shuffle, but I think xtirpation has his finger on the pulse of the subreddit moreso than I do.


##xtirpation##
=======================================================================


IWTL really doesn't need much moderation. From time to time we'll see comments mocking a poster's question and those are generally the ones I'll remove to uphold the idea that there's no such thing as a dumb question. Other than that, I'll look at the new ""spam"" posts from time to time to make sure nothing really important got flagged wrongly by the filter.

We're starting to see more and more variation in topics that Redditors want to learn, and more surprisingly, no matter how rare a skill may be, it seems like someone out there has at least some expertise and can point in the right direction to get people started. Among the favourites that Redditors like to learn are languages, programming, and musical instruments.



##AgentConundrum##
=======================================================================

I think my martial arts IWTL was the first submission ever posted there. It actually has a disclaimer at the top of it saying that I was using it as a sample question. I think that I got some pretty good advice in that thread, even though we were so incredibly young back then. It definitely showed me from very early that this subreddit could be something special. I keep it bookmarked for when things settle down for me and I have the means to start something like that on an ongoing basis.

There have been a few interesting IWTLs that I've followed, like the one on dancing. I've always told my friends that if they ever see me dancing while we're out somewhere that they should immediately call an ambulance because it's a sure sign of alcohol poisoning.

We had another one - I don't think it was that long ago - asking how to properly roll Rs. That one was interesting because apparently there are actually two different ways that people produce an R sound, and I've been doing it ""wrong"" for years. I tried to train myself to do it the other way, but I could never relax my tongue enough to do it. So even though I didn't learn to produce the sound, I did learn why I'm so hopelessly incompetent at it.

As far as having a pulse on the subreddit, I have to admit that I don't know it that well. I try to take a really relaxed view on moderation (I ""moderate in moderation"", if you can forgive the pun) and I just try to keep the spam filter clean. Anything else gets left to the people, so I don't find myself watching the place very closely. I don't know how common the feeling is among mods of other reddits, but I've always felt vaguely guilty about not being overly active in that respect. I spend time there, sure, but it feels like I should be doing more somehow.

I think we're much too varied a subreddit to have a consistent feel. IWTL deals with a wide range of topics, so we get a wide range of subscribers as well. From what I've seen, everyone here just generally wants to help out where they can, and I've been surprised at the breadth of knowledge our subscribers display. Even on really obscure topics, you'll still typically get a few really good answers. It's really cool.


##xtirpation##
=======================================================================

The one thing I learned that really sticks out in my memory is Ruby on Rails. I'd always wanted to try the language out, but could never really get everything set up and working.

I find myself learning things (not in depth, but at least touching on the surface of topics) from other peoples' questions. Very often books and other resources are recommended and I like to check them out when I have the time and give them a quick look.

As for the pulse of the subreddit, I like to think that the community has really embraced the idea that there are no dumb questions and uses up/downvotes as they're intended; to promote legitimate topics and demote submissions that ought not be in IWTL in the first place, like trivia questions. I'm really glad this is the case, otherwise if people downvoted things they didn't want to learn, or if they downvoted topics just because they were ""stupid"", we wouldn't have nearly as many interesting comments and replies.

I think the one thing that embodies the subreddit is a general sense of curiosity. Certainly people don't frontpage us because they constantly have things they want to ask/learn. It's more likely that people want to see what they can learn, and it's their curiosity that brings them back.

Sorry 'bout the late reply, I didn't have an orangered in my modmail before for some reason. Good thing Agent messaged you again, or I would've missed this entirely.



##AgentConundrum##
=======================================================================

Just to touch on the upvote/downvote stuff that xtirpation mentioned, I'll add that when the subreddit was very young I used some CSS to hide the downvote button altogether in an attempt to reinforce the idea that there are no stupid submissions - don't downvote someone just for wanting to learn something you aren't interested/think is stupid.

As the sub grew, and we started getting more than a handful of submissions a day, I started to notice that this didn't scale well. Ultimately we decided to reinstate the downvote button when some less than desirable posts started getting a lot of attention (when you're a small subreddit, any new post can hit the top of the page, even if it's been downvoted). We now have two systems in place to discourage downvoting. First, if you hover over the downvote button, a little tooltip pops up and asks you to think it over first, and that others are entitled to ask what they want. Second, we don't display downvote counts on submissions. Where a post would usually display the vote total, the upvote total, and the downvote total for a submission, I've changed it so that only the upvote total is visible, and at a larger font. The sidebar just says, for example, ""20 people like this"". I think de-emphasizing the downvote total very subtley suggests that downvotes are very much frowned upon outside of certain extreme circumstances.








&gt;&gt;Thanks a lot guys.  I really appreciated our talk.  I look forward to being on /IWantToLearn when I should be /AtWork doing shit.  I like it better here!  : )

DeBushee	226	86	71	"I'm currently an undergrad in a joint honours mathematics and physics degree programme, but I've always been very interested in computer science, coding and programming. Unfortunately, I've never taken the initiative to learn (I was always busy with other stuff) and was wondering how much coding/programming skills I require to be able to apply for jobs in programming, software engineering, as a systems analyst or a quant. Also, how can I start off and work my way up? Any recommendations with how I can keep practice coding whilst juggling my degree at the same time would be highly appreciated!

Thanks in advance, guys! :)

**Edit:** I forgot to mention, my degree programme offers an introductory course on how to use Maple. It is a VERY basic course, and kind of a prerequisite for my calculus modules but I'd like to know my way around it more. Actually, to be honest, I kind of don't understand how programmes like these work. How can they just take a bit of information/command and transform it into a functioning programme? How does it know how to do that? This kind of stuff fascinates me, the fact that some applications that I use on my phone, computer, heck, even this website, had to go through a stage of just simple, basic commands before all managing to come together to form very useful applications and programmes! How does it do that? If there are any good introductory reading you guys can recommend to help get my mind around it, I'd be very grateful.

**Edit(2):** Also, why are there multiple programming languages in existence, such as C++, CSS, Java, etc.? Is it just that we discovered more useful and convenient ways of compiling commands/codes as the complexity of our demands increases, or are there specific uses for each language (i.e. one is useful for making, I don't know, games, while the other is more useful for designing websites, etc.)? Thanks! :)

**Edit(3):** Thank you guys SO much for all the help! :) You're all very awesome, and the more I go through this thread, the more I feel comfortable with the idea of coding and programming. :) I apologize I couldn't thank each and every one of you individually because I've been preparing for finals, so here's me showing my gratitude.

I don't want to get into sundance or become a youtube star or anything like that, I just think it would be a fantastic creative outlet and a way to spend the summer with my husband. But at the same time I'd like to make something slightly more entertaining than a guy in a dollar store mask trying to attack people with a flimsy plastic knife. 

I don't have ANY money to spend....Like maybe $10 a month at the max for things like props. I have a cheap camcorder and lots of artistic and creative talent....and a husband. We also have like 3 friends between the two of us and we rarely ever see them. I can't rely on giving them parts in the film really or we'll never get to finish. So its just me and hubby doing it all. 

My question lies in things like: how do I find places to film? How can I do a scene in the woods where someone screams or has a weapon--and not have the entire state's worth of police show up on us? How can I creatively alter and/or add sounds to the things we film? Any good free software that I should look into? Where can I find typical 'nails on a chalkboard' spine tingling horror movie sounds for free. Like that sharp violin sound you hear when something freakish happens. What are some inside tips and tricks for interesting effects? 


Any good forums or websites I could use for inspiration? ANYTHING you could offer to help me get started would be greatly appreciated. I'd love to hear from people who've done this sort of thing before.

this, you don't want to do this"", but it's like my body isn't listening.
ex 2: I want to stop being lazy and enjoy life... but I spend most of my time doing what feels comfortable. I simply don't FEEL like going out and enjoying the company of others. Instead I do what's easy, simply because it takes little effort. Even when I do FINALLY force myself, I end up just 'being there'. I have no idea what to say, and if I do then it stays in my head because I'm afraid to say it out loud.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I've been told that I'm severely depressed, but that's not exactly a workable solution. I feel like I lack self-discipline more than anything. I mean, I don't FEEL sad. Of course, sometimes I am depressed simply at the fact that I can't get myself to  do what I know needs to be done.

Edit 2:  Thanks everyone for your sound advice!  From all of the advice, it seems perspective is everything.  I know that deep down I have been successful. I'm not rich, but I do have a family, and a house, and cars (none of which are paid for), but I just know that I could've applied myself more when it comes to my career, and that's a frustrating reality.

How to deal with verbally aggressive people? If you speak calmly and rationally, they see this as weakness and enjoy the verbal stomp. If you try to correct them or appeal to reason it only strengthens their irrationality.

I have a feeling that verbally aggressive people have power issues so who does one *effectively* deal with this for a welcome outcome?

Edit: Verbally aggressive means shouting over the top of you, name calling, not allowing you to get your point across as they shut you down. 

I feel that if I raise my voice and start shouting like them - it is just a waste of time.

Any help?

My main problem is that my mind won't switch off. All of the thoughts of the day collect up. It's not a stress thing either; I'll always find something to think about no matter how I feel. 

Even when I try to clear my mind of my thoughts, I am then distracted by my breathing, or itchiness. I've tried just lying flat on my back until I just fall asleep out of tiredness, but I can never see it through to the end (after a while it gets extremely itchy and uncomfortable, and if I resist long enough my hands and feet even start jerking on their own which creeps my out a little); and it usually takes much longer than me not trying.

So, yeah, what do? I'd preferably want to do this without medication though, as I don't want to have to rely on it. If I can I'd want to be able to do it naturally.

Our new spot is right near a busy center with a Super Target, Home Depot, Caribou Coffee, Subway, etc. and a roundabout. Many of the students take public transportation to the school and the bus coming from one direction parks across the street. Once the year begins, the students will have to cross a very busy intersection where there is no stop sign. I'm very concerned for safety.

I would like to petition city council/city planners to get a 4-way stop sign installed at this intersection (or even at the very least, a yellow ""school zone"" blinky light sign thing). 

Who do I call? What do I do? What person in the city council should I contact (is it the city planner)?

1372549003.0	1hc4hs	I want to learn how to not have a quivering voice in meetings	no_doubt	144	40	52	"Hi everyone,
For as long as I can remember, I've had a fear of public speaking. My heart pounds and voice quivers when it's my turn to speak up in meetings and/or speeches. The pounding builds up as my turn approaches and when it's my turn, my fight-or-flight response is insane. I just want to run out of the room!

 If it were just for speeches it would be fine, but I have regular weekly meetings and this issue has really held back my career. 

So far I have been getting by using a bit of propanalol. However, this really isn't a sustainable solution. I feel guilty taking this route. Also, propanalol seems to destroy my short-term memory which shows when trying to answer technical questions. Even though I'm normally well-spoken, I end up coming off a bit spacey in meetings. Also, I can't plan for impromptu situations. E.g. In the past I've had meetings where a senior executive visits and folks in the company had to introduce themselves. Those went disastrously for me and led to very bad impressions in front of everyone.
It was so bad, even the people sitting next to me got nervous. So I know that it's not just in my head.

I feel that I'm the only person I've seen who has it this bad. I've seen people who are nervous in speeches (but recover quickly) but no-one who get's nervous in regular meetings. I'm otherwise not an awkward person (with the exception of getting nervous around very senior people).

I'm 28 and I really want to overcome this and not be something I look back on after several years and regret. I've tried and am trying a bunch of things like yoga, running (to develop cardio-strength), homeopathy (lycopodium), hypnosis (I _think_ it works for regular situations but I'm afraid to put it to a live test) etc. I suspect it may be a medical issue even - heavy-metal poisoning from cavity filings or weakened stress-handling as a result of childhood gastroentritis &amp; bouts of malaria; but these are just shots in the dark.

I would really appreciate help from anyone else who has overcome such a problem.

Thanks a lot, Reddit. Stay awesome!

Edit: just to clarify I'm not throwing lamps or hitting my dogs. I dont have anger problems but my first reaction (and I'm certain this is the case for many others) is to just yell at them till they stop. I know this doesn't help, this is what I want help with. 

Edit2: I tried to be vague in my original posting so the advice could be broad enough for people to absorb. Now that some great advice has been spilled ill go into more detail about MY situation. 

3 9 y/o sibling Chihuahuas, lets call them Alpha, Beta, and Female
My most angering moments is feeding time. Alpha and Beta refuse to NOT eat out of different bowls. They MUST eat at the same bowl and this leads to competitive, constant bickering and growling which CAN escalate to full on fights. I could let them eat in different rooms but I'm a bit stubborn and feel like they would somehow win or I would just be putting a bandaid on a much bigger issue. When they start fighting, I start fighting... 

 In similar vein, if Beta has found the coziest spot in the kennel or on my lap, Alpha MUST then have that spot. Alpha can't STAND when Beta gets visible, noticeable comfort or attention. He gets jealous and fights can start from this too. When he acts like this I yell at him and say useless stuff like ""LEAVE HIM ALONE!!"" While smacking his butt.  Often times the two of them can't stand to be 5 feet from eachother, yet they put themselves in that position anyways. Very frustrating. 

Female is a bitch in all senses of the word. She learned from the two boys and thus from me to snap and bite her way to what she wants. She hates the boys. With passion. She's very stubborn. If she doesn't want something like going outside, she will NOT have it. She will sit. And stair. Until you try to move her in which case the teeth come out. I give in and let her be a spoiled brat, because unfortunately I started raising these guys when I was 11 and now that I'm 20 I can really see the damage my immaturity has done. Consequently she is my favorite, and I spoil her rotten with the most attention. 

When they don't fight, they're good dogs, honestly. They know stay, outside, basic whistle commands and follow them greatly for the most part. It only makes me more frustrated that I KNOW they can be good dogs when they act up and start fighting each other. 

These are the jist of the issues. I personally need to take them for more walks and keep my cool because they are just dogs. I may also be slightly under feeding them assuming that one big can is good enough for three small dogs. There is a lot I, and many others, can remedy and this thread has been hugely helpful in pointing those out. Thanks for the links and resources as well, truly. "	t5_2rjo5	True

I currently work an afternoon shift that starts at 3, which I at first liked because it allowed my body to wake up when it was ready, rather than being jarred awake by an alarm; however, I have been staying up later and later in an attempt to socialize and this often leaves me getting up with very little time to get ready and I feel like my morning has been wasted. It's also the only opportunity to get errands done as everything's closed by midnight, when I get home. I also feel terrible for missing out on time with my boyfriend, with whom I can only currently contact via Skype; I'm always sleeping way too late or falling asleep while we're talking after I get home. Even on days I do let myself sleep, I still feel generally tired and yawn a lot the whole time I'm awake.

For months I've tried setting an alarm for mid-morning to give myself a few hours of freedom, but I seem to be building up a resistance as I've slept through it completely on a number of occasions and it's becoming unreliable. I don't know how much this is related but I am not a particularly healthy eater at the moment (again, no time for errands means I usually eat out) and the only exercise I get is walking two blocks to the train station for work. Does anyone have suggestions for giving myself more energy, more perkiness? Is this work schedule hindering me, should I get better hours like an 8-4 thing?

EDIT: Wow, lots of responses here. Thanks everybody for your advice and personal experiences; it seems the general consensus is 'spend energy to make energy' and a healthier diet to accompany it. I will definitely try adding some exercises into my day and see where that takes me, then advance from there. I really appreciate everybody taking the time to help me out. =)"	t5_2rjo5	True
1350016254.0	11cnjg	I want to learn to sound intelligent in everyday conversation and speak smoothly and eloquently.	essentialparadoxes	125	22	35	"This topic has come up before, and the advice usually is along the lines of improving your vocabulary, reading more, enunciating properly, and honing your non-verbal skills. 

However, my problem is a little different. I already am a voracious reader with an expansive vocabulary. I write both for work/school (scientific manuscripts) and for fun (novels), and have no problem with written communication. I have been told I'm an excellent public speaker and am quite practiced at giving presentations, despite having a severe anxiety disorder.

But those types of communication involve words that are either rehearsed or well thought-out.

When it comes to casual conversation, I fall flat and sound like I have brain damage. I completely blank on simple words and forget the names for the things I'm trying to talk about. I lose my train of thought and skip parts of sentences. I stutter and jumble words. I use tons of fillers like ""um"" and ""like."" (""So sometimes I, uh, you know, use a... goddamn, what's it called? The thing for cutting up food? The, um, food.... chopper? Um, uh, the pro-pro-processor? The food processor. For the sauce. For garlic for the pizza. I mean, sometimes I use the food processor to mince garlic for the pizza sauce. But sometimes I, like, just chop it by hand"")

I can see the people I'm speaking to trying painfully hard to be patient as I finish a thought or losing interest. I don't know if it's nervousness or what, but it happens with friends as well as strangers.

It's almost as if my mouth and brain are out of sync. If I have a funny story to retell it's fine, because I really enjoy being a storyteller and rehearse stories in my head until they are just right, but spontaneity is not my friend.

I am not a total loser in life, at least not in my scholar career, but I spend to much time daydreaming about being much more successful, for example having a certain girl I had a crush on, or being really good at guitar instead of training harder. Even if one part of me, the rational one, is aware that it is useless on a short term and destructive on the long run; another part sadly enjoys this comfort. I have been like that since I was a teenager, but today it's hitting a peak. I'd like to know if someone was like that and managed to change and become less dreamy. It's probably just a matter of self-discipline, but is it something you can abruptly change from one day to another, or should you progressively force yourself to be more persistent every new day? I am fairly sure there is no magic pill for that, but if someone had one day a revelation, a new view on this problem (which I think is probably really general) well something that changed him, I'd like to hear it.

Conversely, in addition to lack of healthiness, less sleep also tends to yield less energy. This means that completing tasks might take longer in general. I also could mean I'd be less motivated to perform a task at all if I lack the energy to do it.

Some sources also suggest that the amount of hours spent sleeping might not matter as much (in terms of grogginess during the day) as whether you wake up inbetween a sleep cycle sucessfully.

This is mainly because we don't know if the users sending out invitations have ulterior motives. We don't know if the emails are being harvested and misused, and we have no way of confirming whether the website being promoted is legitimate (it's currently in an invite-only state).

I'd also like to remind everyone that ""I want to teach"" posts aren't allowed in /r/iwanttolearn. These posts should be placed in /r/iwanttoteach, which was created the last time this topic came up about a year ago.

It started with my dad who was an extremely confident wont take no for an answer type of guy. I'm 29 now and even today I find I can be awkward around him.

The area in which this really affects my life is with work, I feel it holds me back, I would really like to be the type of person that can joke around with or just have a normal chat with bosses or management. But also use it to assert myself more with what I want.

I was recently working along side someone and would have a great time chatting and joking around all day at work, but he recently got promoted to a pretty high position within the company and now I even find myself being weird around him.

In general I'm pretty chatty, and feel I have a lot of great ideas at work but have trouble putting them across with much confidence, as soon as my boss challenges my idea I fold straight away.

Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

Another reason I want to become less lazy is so that I can gain more hobbies when I go back to university. I feel like literally i'm not talented at anything. I know this sounds really silly because everyone is talented at something and I get that, but I want to find what I am good at and to be able to feel proud about myself for doing things in my life, if not to make me feel better then my family and friends! In particular I just want stuff to fill my days with instead of plodding on my computer playing games and listening to music. I know when I go back to my uni and I gain some of my student loan i want to learn guitar but i definitely want some other hobbies outside of that to get me by!

If anyone has any tips then PLEASE tell me they will be much appreciated, as far as i'm concerned I will do anything to change my mentality towards life around, and go from a person who lays on their ass all day during the summer to a person who is a good example to others.

I grew up in a family of scientists and engineers...really brilliant and hardworking people. Growing up, my parents constantly told me my (small) accomplishments weren't good enough. I was constantly compared to my higher achieving friends.

My entire life I've worked my ass off in school to get good grades. Not necessarily because I wanted to ""succeed"" and have a good career, but to prove to myself that I wasn't stupid. I grew up with the belief that I wasn't as smart as other kids, so I had to work twice as hard to get the same results. I have average intelligence, but a killer work ethic. That's the only thing I pride myself in.

Right now I'm pursuing Computer Science. Math/CS courses kicked my ass, and I'm barely holding on to a 3.1 GPA. I can't find the words to describe how much I studied to barely get B's. Despite being discouraged, I continued to fight my way through.

Lately I've been a little depressed. It's not even school that's getting me down, but my peers. All the CS geeks in my classes are so fucking brilliant. Oh my God. They're so smart and can solve difficult problems in their sleep in a matter of seconds. I work my motherfucking ass off to get 50-75% of the solution but I'm never quite there. I can't live up to them. They're getting such stellar internships and amazing grades, and I for some reason doubt I can ever live up to that.

My coding skills are mediocre at best right now. I'm working everyday to improve which is more than other people can say, but progress is incredibly slow.

My inadequacy pervades all my thoughts. All day I think ""I'm not good enough, I'm not smart enough..."" over and over and over and that's the only reason why I continue studying. To prove that I'm NOT stupid. Waiting for one day for the lightbulb above my head to turn on and make me realize ""Holy shit! I'm actually pretty smart!"".

So I'm not really sure what to do. Before haters tell me drop out and do something else, kindly fuck off. I'm hell-bent on finishing this degree.

My family doesn't take me seriously, and they don't take my decisions seriously. Even if I bring up a piece of information they don't know, they will question or dismiss the validity of that info by asking where I got it. No matter where I got it from, they scoff. Other times they say dismissively, ""Why do you know that?"" The other day I told my brother I started liking football. I have never liked sports and he could not believe that I knew anything about football. When I responded with facts that I had learned, he said ""you just googled that."" I was disappointed because I wanted to have a conversation with him about the sport, which we have never done before. My parents also think I am ""addicted"" to video games, even though they have no idea how much I play (I have a job, I play a few hours a day). But apparently it's ""unnatural"" for a 21 year old woman to like games. Shit like that.

I guess what I'm saying is, they have preconceptions that they make EVERY EFFORT to reinforce (and never rethink), even if they have to make up facts to support it.

I am not an immature person, I was never rebellious, and I am intelligent. I am reserved, I don't blurt things out. They always praised me, when I was an obedient child. But now that I have started making choices in my life independently of them, they can't take me seriously.  I just want to learn how to make them take me seriously as an adult.

NewbyManager	114	33	38	"So, I got promoted and am quite happy about it of course, but new questions arise. Now I will be part of the ""management circle"" in an office that mostly consist of managers being older than 30 years. How can I ensure that those managers will respect me for the skills I own, and won't look down on me for my age?

Now I think of it, I'm the youngest employee in the office, and will be leading people that are years older then me.

My general rules around office politics are:

-Be as good as possible at working on your responsibilities

-Don't steal away other peoples responsibilities, even though you know you can do a better job in it (but help if they ask)

-Making friends is not a priority in the office, but avoid making enemies at all times

-Only speak when you have something useful to add into a discussion (weak point, working on it)

-Be patient with co-workers, no matter how stupid you think they are

-No gossiping!


What would you expect from a 20 year old just starting out in the business who got promoted into management? What should I avoid doing at all costs, and what should I do to earn general respect/acceptance from older managers who might see me as the ""noobie""?

Furthermore, money does not exist in this particular equation. As for laws, I guess stealing and hurting others are something I hope none of us will do and also is not allowed in the equation. If you will, I am just talking about survival (living healthy) in a city as if you were tribesmen from the Amazon who landed in a city and had to find/create the basic needs.

Nail polish, I'm a guy, but it's not such an issue, if my nails were actually long enough to paint I probably would, but they're not, there's not enough bare nail between cuticle and tip to paint (I have small hands, so it's not -quite- as bad as it sounds).


The bad tasting stuff worked for a few days, until I wound up associating the taste with chewing my nails, and started liking it, or just picking.


Willpower or slapping doesn't work, because it's very rarely actually a concious thing, less 'I find them in my mouth', but just, it's almost instinct sort of.

You see, whenever I go out in public, I am paranoid about what people think about me. So when I see someone looking at me, I look back at them multiple times, seeing their reaction from my presence. The result makes me look like I'm trying my best to hide an anxiety attack or something of the sort. On top of that, I have trouble keeping eye contact with people for more than a couple seconds, so my eyes move around a lot and tend to avoid people's eyes.

It's just so awkward to me when I make eye contact. I don't exactly know what to do when they're looking at me. So when I shift my eyes nervously as I'm walking past someone (or a group of people), I either get odd looks or get laughed at. In both cases, I feel like shit when I know they were judging me. I have a bad time when I'm at the mall, popular event, school, etc. I'm always doing something weird because of my social anxiety, which makes it even worse.

My goals include following the news, expanding my knowledge of international politics and important issues, and studying history in a somewhat serious manner. 

With the news I tend to get overwhelmed. I'd like to come up with some kind of system where I filter out for quality, in-depth stories yet keep up-to-date with a wide range of topics/regions (though I don't care for keeping up with sensational criminal trials and the like). I enjoy some of the analysis of obscure events that tie into bigger ones that pundits such as Rachel Maddow put together but I hate vegging in front of the TV and I hate the feeling of getting pulled into news cycles that just end up being overhyped political drama. Maybe a digest of broadcast, cable, and radio news in addition to a print one?

For my other interests I'm mainly reading non-fiction right now. I really hate the feeling that I'll forget a good amount of the detail of what I read which makes me feel compelled to put everything I read on my re-read list (which is problematic considering I still have a substantial to-read list). For simpler works, it's just a matter of recording arguments and the like which I don't have much of a problem with. But with denser works, such as historical monographs (which I sometimes need to supplement with some rudimentary studying of the subject), I want to retain a deeper knowledge and understanding of the subject, including key figures, dates, events, geography, etc, in addition to the author's arguments. I'm thinking of just treating it like a class and drawing up timelines and the like for myself. Does anyone else go this far with personal reading? Any suggestions for a system of organizing knowledge for myself (a personal wiki, a series of documents, notebooks, etc)? On a grander scale I want to approach my learning in a more organized manner rather than be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information there is on a single topic and feel confident that I ""know"" a sufficient amount about something and can move on to a new topic."	t5_2rjo5	True

However, I am absolutely terrible at remembering what I read/watched/learned. After a few weeks all but the most basic things seem to have escaped me. Character names, finer plot points, song titles, theoretical explanations, very little of it seems to ""stick"". 

Discussing these subjects with other people becomes very frustrating to me because it often quickly becomes painfully obvious to me how shallow my once-decent knowledge has become. For example, today I was watching a documentary about relativity with my brother, and though I had a class on it and understood the theory behind it a few years ago, now I had a hard time coming up with any halfway-decent answer to his questions. When I discuss classes I had with other students they often seem to remember much more details, though I get about the same grades as they do. 

Has anyone been in the same boat as me and found a way to improve themselves in this regard? I am also extremely forgetful in day-to-day things and very possibly have ADD.

1351303122.0	125m9m	IWTL: How to be less socially anxious, less awkward, and hold conversations.	tandtroll	108	35	34	"Hello reddit,

I have just realized how pathetic and ordinary my life is, and always have been. I'm socially anxious, and generally awkward around people. I have always had trouble conversing with them. It has reached to a point where I think it's highly affecting my future.

I'm like a god of shyness and social anxiety. Whenever I'm with people, I get highly self-conscious, I start panicking, and as a result, I blurt out the most random stuff. I can't hold any conversation or any argument, because I start to stutter and stammer. I start mispronouncing words, and that is most embarrassing. My thought process bogs down and I make a complete fool of myself.

Whenever I'm with a group of people, I don't know what to talk about. I want to spark a topic of discussion but I can never think of anything. This stupid anxiety also kicks in whenever I'm required to give my opinion on whatever that is being discussed. I simply give a short answer because,  like I said, my thought process slows down.

This social disorder is really destroying my life. I love people, and I want to share so much but fuck! I dread the day when I'll have to attend interviews and debates.

How did I realise this? My cousin just came over for vacation from his university and showed me his videos and pictures. It's like he's not even trying, he's natural. Leading discussions, debating stuff, giving speeches, and his way with women.

Fuck my life. How do I get rid of this 'disease'? Pardon me for the rant."	t5_2rjo5	True

I've had a Raspberry Pi for a while that I've tinkered with however I haven't done anything more on the electronic side with it (i.e: The GPIO pins) except for soldering together an LCD assembly from Adafruit and getting that to work. I've already ordered a breadboard and some other small electronics supplies upon reccomendation from a friend of mine. I'm planning on creating something simple for now, in this case a way to control a small electric motor from an RC car with the Pi, I found a circuit diagram on a website and a friend of mine helped me with it and said it should work.

Where do I go from here? What is some stuff you'd reccomend? Resources, websites, books, etc?

Also, another small question I have related to this. I'm colorblind (red-green), which makes reading resistors nearly impossible. What do you recommend to help with this?

1366413149.0	1cpgvk	IWTL How to create programs that interact with other programs/OS/webpages/etc	worm929	91	22	11	"Hello! thanks for opening my post.

so here is my deal:  i know quite a bit of programming, im in no ways an expert but im not a begginer either. Currently im studying Java but my problem is that all the programs i make are really REALLY basic: 

""input (Integer/String/Array)  -&gt; compute (find X in Y/change the order/math) -&gt; show output on console""

this is great and all, but it has no REAL PURPOSE as is.

 i want to know HOW programs interact with each other, where do they get the data and how they make it work. 

For example:

* Daemon tools (creates a virtual cd on the computer) 

* TuneUp utilities (lets you change every setting on the OS)

* www.lolking.net (grabs a lot of background data from a videogame and shows it in a website with graphs, etc)

I understand that 'TuneUp' just goes and modifies values in the registry to change Windows' setting, but my question is HOW can it do it? HOW with Java line codes i can access the registry and change things ^(i know tuneup its not programmed in java ) . THIS is what i want to learn.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. i appreciate any help i can get.

EDIT: Thanks for the responses so far, i want to add to anyone with a similar problem reading this that http://www.codecademy.com has some tutorials on how to work with APIs, sadly they are not in Java (they are in Python and Ruby) but you can get a general idea.

1355780984.0	150jpv	IWTL how to make a complete new set of friends	ThatMortalGuy	90	17	37	"Here's the problem:  
  
I'm an immigrant who came to this country (US) at the age of 18 and have spent about seven years working hard to help my family in my country as well as the family members who came here with me.  In the process of doing this I kind of gave up my social life as well as my hobbies, I was working two jobs and the little time I had free I spent it sleeping so I could have some strength to keep working my two jobs.  
Now I think I'm finally ready to separate from my family and live my life to the fullest however there is one problem... My friends suck, they are not bad friends but they are just the kind of people I don't want to be associated with when I start my new life because they have no hobbies besides getting drunk and doing drugs (it's kind of sad actually, I have tried to help them but they don't like change).  So I want to make a new set of friends, friends who have stuff in common with me, friends who want to play sports, go to movies, experience new things etc, but the problem lies in that I have no idea of how to go about making new friends.  
The main reason why would be because I have always been shy (I'm not as shy as I used to be now, kind of the opposite but still not where I would like to be) and on top of that I don't speak the language as well as I would like (can understand and read/write pretty good) and I want friends who speak English so I can fully immerse in this culture and fully experience this country who is my new home from now on.  
  
So can you guys give me some pointers? I really have no idea how or where to start.  
Will write this here because it might give you a better idea of who I am and how to better help me  
  
- I'm a 25ish years old male  
- I love to play the guitar but I suck at it due to not playing it for so many years  
- I love photography  
- I have a lot of hobbies but don't dedicate a lot of time to them (this will change once I leave one of my jobs and move out)  
- I love playing all kinds of sports (but somehow not interested in American football) and I don't see the appeal of watching sports in the TV but from time to time will watch stuff like the World cup of football or baseball.  
- I enjoy having a few beers with friends but don't want to do that ""lets drink 'till we pass out"" stuff  
- I love playing videogames on my PC and doing geeky stuff on it.  
- I love experiencing new stuff which  is probably the reason why I have so many hobbies but kind of hate that about myself because I end up being a Jack of all trades and master of none  
- Spanish is my native language,  I'm pretty  good at English (problems with pronunciation of some words) and I want to learn a third language but I'm waiting 'till I'm done with English.

(EDIT: We have a ton of good time together and it's always laid back and relaxing for the most part so we end up doing less physically active stuff. It's just sometimes we bump into little stupid stuff that can be ignored or just go along with type of situation). So I am 20, turning 21 this October. He's 20 as well. I'm just finishing up this semester and I don't think it's going well and it's my probation semester... So I'm under a lot of stress from this relationship and school. Not only that, but I also stopped using birth control since few weeks ago so I have been dealing with some side effects that kind of prevents me from being myself and having a good time. 

I currently live at home and commute to school. My boyfriend lives about 15 minutes away by drive. I work part time at my parent's restaurant - Korean and Japanese cuisine. I don't make much because it's only tip dependent and it's not a big restaurant. I sort of have a lot of free time I guess and those free times I haven't spent it for myself ever since I started my relationship with him. If I have to tell you my hobbies that I used to enjoy would be playing the bass guitar (i used to use at church but I don't have my own and I stopped attending Sunday services), photography, singing, dancing, and yoga. I've been longboarding with my boyfriend since about a year and a half ago. I haven't been really active in that either. Yet, I love having adventures and I really want to travel but that's also hard because I don't have anything saved and I am struggling to get myself together.

Please give me any advice. I want to change. I want to become somebody. I want to stand out to my bf and especially for myself and my friends and family. My bf hates the way I am right now -- being low of myself, complaining, and not being lively like I used to be and that is the biggest thing he admired about me. I never knew it was a big thing to someone else. I always thought I wasn't good at anything and that's why I focused more on his life rather than mine. Any help would be appreciated.

But I am no good at fapping with the fappers haysoos gave me. When I was pubertal, I could get incredibly mentally turned on, then fap for approximately 8 nanoseconds and have an incapacitating orgasm, but now I can neither get that enthusiastic nor hope for orgasm with even eight hours of fapping. It just doesn't seem to feel great. Good, but not enough for orgasm. 

I've had non-vibrator orgasms with partners, but few and far between--far meaning years--and probably only five or so with my husband of nearly a bunnyrubbing decade. I get to a point of arousal, and then . . . I don't know if it's a missed bus, or not going at it aggressively enough, or what, but I just can't seem to go over the edge without hardcore clit-jiggling action.

So, yes--I've long since dragged buzzies into the mix, but I've tried to wean myself off of them, and what happens is: months of no orgasms. You'd think that eventually my necessity would make me have the mother of all inventions, but it never happens. I know some women need extra stimulation, and that I may be one of them. I don't feel guilty or less-than, necessarily, but my nagging suspicion is that I'm not doing it right. 

Reading today's front-page girl-fapping post brought it to the fore again. Naked, clothed, drugged, drunk, shaved, gently cuddled, kissed, licked, hardcore fucked--it all ends in frustration and the resignation of vibration. Everyone has fantastic boinking fun, but I want to fap like nature and leaves and wildebeests intended. There are definitely self-stroke tropes that get me aroused, but what are some things I can try? What are your fap-tested, clit- and Gräf-approved mental and physical methods?

As I round out 35, this is getting more and more frustrating. My body and brain want to come many, many times. 2011 is the year of the hand. I am going to do this thing!

TL;DR: I know my female body. I think I am capable of fapping to completion with hands, but want some concrete suggestions. I'll try your ideas and report back, IamA grown-ass woman who is learning to fap all over again style. My husband is ready and willing to assist.

1363743306.0	1amv1z	IWTL how to control my dreams.	paco_is_paco	112	43	13	"Ever since I saw ""Waking Life"" (like ten years ago) I became interested in lucid dreaming. I've read some books and even found some Android apps that are supposed to help one lucid dream. In all these years I can remember attaining lucidity only a handful of times and all of these occurred when I wasn't trying to. The worst part is that when I realize that I'm awake in my dream I get too excited and I wake up. So, I guess I want to learn to lucid dream on purpose and maintain in the dream long enough to enjoy it. Just like the people who wrote the books/apps claim to do.

**edit:** thanks to everyone for all the great advice. I've added the LD subs to my frontpage and I'm reading tons. I'm going try the phone screen and dream glove tricks. 

I'm remembering more dreams where I could have been aware but not lucid. I have ""recurring"" dreams where I'm exploring impossible houses where I know they're impossible but I don't think to reality test. My last lucid event happened in one of these houses when it became a very populated bustling warehouse. My ""house"" dreams aren't usually populated.

That was a couple of nights ago. I really excited to start dreaming on purpose. Thank you all for pointing me in the right direction."	t5_2rjo5	True

MokshaMilkshake	89	21	9	"I grew up around a Cuban and Italian family and ever since I can remember, dinner was all about preparing fresh herbs and spices. I still constantly use garlic, basil, cilantro, rosemary, and other popular herbs, but I buy them in dried shakers like most of modern America. I would love to change that! To be able to reach over and grab a fresh sprig of rosemary or a few parsley leaves would be absolutely wonderful. The only problem is that I am fairly poor with little money to spare and live in a small apartment in New England.

I've seen a few pictures online of people growing plants in over-the-door shoe organizers as well as large seed planter kits you can buy at WalMart. That seems like a great place to start, but I haven't grown anything before and wouldn't want to waste a large start up cost over beginner mistakes. I'm also fairly certain that herbs need a good amount of sunlight and we don't have much of that where we live.

Of course I never went through with it. I don't want to have a record and get sent to jail. 

I don't know why co-workers are bullies. I mean everybody there in your team is trying to make a living. Some co-workers make it harder to work there. 

For instance today I have things to do. Some important things to do. By the way I just started there a week ago. It's a temp to permanent position. I walk by this co-worker that I don't know very well. He tells me ""your lazy"" I said ""What?"". He asks me ""You're going home?"". I said ""yeah"". ""Well your lazy"". I just walked away. Turns out he left too. A minute before I did. Yeah hypocrite I thought. 

Just to clear things up. My boss told me to go home. It's really slow. Because of the inventory team coming in tomorrow. All we did was clean today. 

So how do you deal with those kind of co-workers? It will be nice to beat them at their own game without getting into jail.

Reading is the worst, I hated it in high school, I've always felt it's like reading code. I've always excelled at the technical side of english, vocab, grammar, and read technical non-fiction stuff, but with Shakespeare is like a foreign language.

I saw an interview with Patrick Stewart where he said his teacher had him read some Shakespeare when he was like 12 and he instantly saw the power of the language and understood every word and it became his life from that moment. It's made me puzzle over why some people have this almost innate love of Shakespeare. I noticed a lot of times big fans of literature or actors usually had an english teacher who really inspired them. I didn't really have one, and maybe that's the problem, I'm just not a big literature/fiction reader overall, but I'd like to see if I can now.

I've had my fair share of partners and a few good relationships, but I honestly couldn't tell you how they happened - it certainly wasn't because I flirted. But those days are over (at least until I move). And I must adapt. Because, frankly, it's been a year and a half and I just wanna get laid.

My *main* problem? I can't take the shit seriously. I can't just be dropping the words 'baby' and 'sexy' everywhere, it makes me giggle and that tends to ruin the mood. I also don't really feel comfortable with randomly touching people when I don't know how they'd feel about it, either - seems arrogant. I get put off by the sheer amount of assumption that must go on in normal-people flirting. I'm also pretty sure that when I think I'm giving 'come hither' looks, they just think I'm angry. Not that I've ever asked. Maybe *I* shouldn't assume.

The whole thing just kind of boggles my mind, and I've never been able to do it and, quite frankly, find it all a little ridiculous. The second a guy starts flirting with me my brain decides to shut down and give literal answers to questions instead of coy innuendo like you're supposed to. And when I actually *do* attempt coy innuendo, it comes out like I'm a 5th grader who's just discovered boys. 

For the record, I can converse about all kinds of stuff; I have an insanely wide variety of interests and a great social life. So talking and socializing, itself, isn't a problem. Just the flirting aspect of it. 

And hell, while I'm at it - how in the living hell do people take dirty talk seriously? I mean, I have no problem with dropping the occasional ""fuck me,"", but shit like ""you know you want my hot cock in your little pussy bitch"" just makes me straight-up *laugh*. I totally don't get it. I feel like I'm missing out on some intrinsic part of the human experience here. Someone, please, explain it to me!"	t5_2rjo5	True
1327251724.0	orkrj	IWTL How to wake up in the mornings	spearhard	83	14	51	"I'm a freshman living in a college dorm, and I've been having an issue of not being able to get myself to wake up when I need to. I've realized this issue and I set my alarm really early when I need to go to class, but I've been missing out on fun things on weekends just because I sleep too late. 

My alarm clock is across the room from my bed, and when it does wake me up I will often get up, either hit snooze or turn it off, and then go back to bed, and wake up later than I wanted to, barley remembering getting up earlier. Does anyone have any advice on how to force myself to get up when I hear the alarm?"	t5_2rjo5	True

Because I'm so focused on analyzing the past and attempting to predict the future outcomes, I forget the experience and enjoy the present. I'm constantly worrying about what has happened, what WILL happen, and so on...

Also, over the past year I've had a dramatic increase in blood pressure, which I believe to be purely because of my anxiety. This morning my BP was 143. Before going to see the doctor for a different a issue, I was extremely tense. I was very worried about WHAT IF the doctor found some illness in me? Before walking into the office, the nurse checked my BP and it read exactly 170. Not good.

I understand I need to ""let things go"", ""stop worrying so much"", ""be confident"", etc. OK, but how? I've heard the advice, but I have an incredibly hard time believing it. If I have an upcoming test, how can I NOT worry about it? If my blood pressure is increasing, how do I RELAX? I don't know how to let things go and stop over analyzing things, because I fear that if I do, I'll get completely fucked over because I ""didn't think things through"" if that makes any sense. 

TL;DR: I worry too much, which worsens my mental and physical health, which causes me great distress, and the vicious cycle repeats.

EDIT: The only two possible solutions I can think of are exercising more, and meditating. Running always calms me down, and I've heard from a lot of people that meditation helps relieve anxiety and stress.

I really want to change. For the first time in my life I feel like I should be looking towards the future. This past year has almost been surreal...

As a child, I was always told I had so much potential and I would do great things in this world, not only from my mother, but from many other people. I think this programmed me to be the person I am today, someone that think things will happen the way they happen because ""potential"" is already half the job.

I know that I am not a ""special"" individual. I still to this day get people (co-workers and such) telling me all the things they would do if they had half my talent, but most of the time I feel completely dumb.

I work at a job earning less then half what my peers do, for a company where I make their sites, which make the revenue which is given to the salespeople for ""their hard work"". I have 100% of the ability to do this for my own, I just don't feel  motivated into doing it.

1368875123.0	1ekler	IWanttoLearn how to build a treehouse	Mukilab	94	31	12	"So my friend found an amazing tree and he showed it to me yesterday. I'd hazard that it is 25-30m high. It's in a public park, the bottom is very hard to get up unless you know how and at first glance you would dismiss it as a tree for climbing due to the bottom. Near the top, there are so many leaves that people from the bottom can't see you and vice versa. It has a ridiculous amount of branches as you go up and it is absolutely amazing to climb.


We've decided to make a summer project out of it (we're both in highschool, a year from University) so we're going to buy some rope and make a treehouse out of it.
So far we want to:

* Build several hammocks/beds: interwoven rope between two branches which we can lie on
* Build a rope system to haul things up in a basket - should be easy
* Build a belaying system so we can self-belay (without jamming hooks or anything like that into the tree and harming it)
* And just about anything else we can think of. We already tried building a swing which we did quickly yesterday and was a lot of fun.


The thing is, although my friend is fairly experienced in building stuff and tying knots, I know next to nothing. Does anyone know any resources for:

* Learning how to tie knots
* Self-belaying
* Building things like hammocks


Is there anything else I should know? I'm guessing the self-belaying system will be hardest to make plus we will need to buy specialised equipment.

What kind of rope should we use? Yesterday we had mooring rope but its fairly expensive so we were thinking of getting cheaper, 12mm utility rope. 

Is there anything else we should build?

How should we try to hide our rope/efforts so no one sees our work since it will take several days? It's in a public park so a fair bit of people will see it, although not too many. I'm sure other people have climbed this tree, although I have no idea if recently and how many.


Is there anything else I should know? Yes if I fall I have a good chance of breaking my back but the exhilaration and sense of adventure is by far worth the risk. We're also smart about our limits. We climbed it twice yesterday and built the swing but stopped there because we both knew we were getting tired and risk-prone.

I did IB last year and did fairly well, i believe mainly because i keep changing studying styles throughout the year and never find one that im please with and got frustrated instead and end up not studying :(.

So i set out to be a total badass in uni and i want to make my parents proud and now that i discover reddit ( I never found a website with such flexibility and range of subjects or sub-reddits, its amazing).
I believe i can be a better learner now.

Anyway in my new university, all the lecture presentations are available online and they are basically really good summary of the chapter.

What I'm having trouble with is that I'm not sure whether i should re-write all the lecture presentation (they're in pptx file, microsoft powerpoint) into notes
OR
Just print the presentations (6 slides per page, double sided) and read them off.

My trouble is that i feel (FEEL not believe, just to clarify) like that i won't remember much if i don't re-write the presentations into my notebook. (It is literally re-writing because i find that if i summarize a chapter by myself, its similar to what the presentation is if not better. Did an experiment for Chapter 1). I FEEL this is effective but not efficient.

But i cannot keep up with the class and may reach a point where i cut most of my commitments (e.g. my hobbies gaming, FNM, weekend magic, even just a night out to watch movies) and focus on studying just so i can keep my notes a head or neck-to-neck with the class.

Explanation: Because I'm an August Intake, this semester we're only doing 2 subjects however on a normal semester we're be doing 4. Hence why i think i cannot keep up next semester and i want to resolve this problem now.

The alternative is that i print-off the presentation and just read them off from there. This is the much efficient way. However, I'm scared that i might not remember the materials as good as when I'm writing it. Because this is a university there will be no mock-exams or trials, so i cannot test this method without risking my grades. Again, this is only a feeling, i only feel like i won't remember as much, im not certain.

Also, i am certain there are other methods of studying out there. If you have an alternative better method than the two i mention. Do so tell me.

I figured it'd be relevant to subscribers here.		76	14	15	"I'm trying to get the word out on my new subreddit, and I figured this is the perfect platform, since subscribers here are interested in teaching and learning.

My idea for this subreddit came from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/meyo4/can_someone_please_explain_rawls_theory_of/c30htya) post, where a Redditor asked me a question regarding something I had posted. I've setup [r/letmeteachyou](http://www.reddit.com/r/letmeteachyou) with the hopes of spreading knowledge. My intention with the subreddit is to allow Redditors to take something they know, and setup their own class around it. This is your platform to solidify your own knowledge by teaching others about topics you have extensive knowledge in. You could teach them how to write poetry, Java programming language, or any other subject you're good at. You can setup weekly classes, or have it be just one lesson. Redditors can be your students or your TAs, in that they can ask you questions about your lesson, or they can help you by clarifying concepts, or even correcting you when you're mistaken. You may get no comments whatsoever, yet that may just mean your lesson was that good. Others are learning from the knowledge that you're imparting. I've setup some example lessons to give it a start.

I will end this post with a beautiful and relevant quote from George Bernard Shaw:

&gt; “If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.”"	t5_2rjo5	True

I feel pressured into acting a way that I don't really feel, and I want to just be able to let go, not care what they think, and simply be myself around others.

Edit: Here's some more information. Whenever I'm around others, I always feel the need to act 'more cheerful' than I actually am. It's not that I'm not happy, or anything. It's just that I think I have it in my mind, that if I don't act happy, then people will think there's something wrong.

In my early days (I started three years ago), I was hesitant to ask others for help because I wasn't sure of what I really needed. I was very indecisive.

I've gotten better, but not great, at making decisions (picking costumes, set design, etc.). I'm afraid I still come across as wishy-washy, and I think some of my volunteers don't take me seriously because of it. 

However, there are a lot of things that I have a very clear vision about, and yet when I can convince people to get stuff done for me, I'm terrified they're not going to do it the way I want, even if I'm very explicit. I've even gone so far as to make spreadsheets with all of my expectations to the T. And yet they still try to take things their own direction and don't do it the way I want. Sometimes I just want to look these people straight in the eye  and say, ""Just do it the way I told you, idiot.""

It was all fine and dandy as the barbeque started -- I was being social and nice. As the night progressed though I felt that my confidence was dropping and I would like to blame it on the others for having a lot of inside jokes and just talking about people or stuff I had no clue about, but I probably shouldn't blame them. Maybe I should have been able to handle it better? I felt stupid asking what or who they were talking about after a while so I became more and more quiet.


After a while I felt really stale and even though subjects which I easily could have talked about came up I just felt like I had nothing to add and hence stayed quiet for the most part. They noticed that I didn't speak very much and actually asked me to add to the conversation sometimes and it felt kinda silly, I should be able to just speak my mind whenever and not just when someone asks.


I tend to listen a lot more than I speak in group conversations to learn what the group is like, I'm not sure if this is a good thing. It can take a very long time for me to feel ""natural"" in a group because I have to know how the group talks and what kind of language I should use. This also leads to me being completely different when speaking to different acquaintances/friends. Is this healthy? I'm not even sure anymore who I really am the most natural with, maybe I'm not myself with any of my friends and have just adapted to their behaviour?

To put this in perspective, I'm a PhD student in Nanotech and am also quite interested in art and creativity in general (music, film, designs, architecture). But I find that I am way too interested in what's on the internet and video games. And not doing much at all.

It's weird, it's like there's a side of me that is incredibly ambitious and driven, brimming with genuine excitement. But there's also the side of me that is apathetic as fuck and very comfortable in being unimaginative. It sounds like an enormous divide, but it's basically a struggle between being a consumer or creator. I don't know if your experience is similar, I'm sure there are some who feel the same way.

My question, more specifically, is what are some suggestions for nurtuing the creative side of oneself (creative as in producing something, either physical or theoretical) while diminishing the consumptive side?

**EDIT**: Thanks everyone for the great responses! From the consensus it looks like scheduling activities along with reasonable goal setting are a good start.

Well I want to know how to know whoever that is. How do you establish a relationship with people that have a lot of pull or are influential and know their way around things.
For instance, say I wanted to be an actor. Going to a film school in Nebraska probably wouldn't help me, but knowing Judd Apatow might.
Or another example, lets say that I'm a local music artist and me and my band think we have potential to make it big, but playing at the same venues in the same city over and over isn't going to help and it's also not going to help if a local independent label is producing our albums. How would we establish a relationship with the people who book shows at huge amphitheaters or get a record deal with a big label like Sub Pop? 
These are exaggerated and poorly thought out examples, but I feel like I've gotten the point across.

TheTruthBeSold	71	11	22	"I'm currently out working in the Bakken oilfields in North Dakota and Montana. Rent out here is crazy high and life/work is chaotic.

What advice, tips, tricks and pitfalls can you give me about the following:

* Buying: I'm looking for something used, probably lower end. Are there brands to avoid? Brands to buy? Certain features I should look prioritize? What's the ""too good to be true"" limit? What kinds of damage should I look for to haggle with or avoid?

* Maintaining: Obviously I want to take care of this thing. I'd like to be able to resell it eventually. What's the life span on a camper that's being used as a primary residence?

When I look around, or talk with people, I feel like I’m standing ten feet behind myself looking through binoculars.

I've seen in this subreddit several people post about wanting a better memory, but I'm trying to go beyond that, so I hope this doesn't feel like another repost. Years of TV, internet, and alcohol and drug abuse have left my brain a pile of mush. I want to retrain it.

I used to be a people watcher, and recently I’ve taken an interest in several different, but somewhat related subjects, and I’ve been reading on body language, mentalism, relationships, and a whole slew of other things.  These are helping me notice of things I didn’t before, when I can force myself to take in what’s around me, because they give me specific things to look for. 

I recently started Moonwalking with Einstein, and I want to learn more about building a memory palace to help retain some of the information that leaks out everyday. I've also heard about them from Derren Brown and on the show The Mentalist (of course Derren Brown is/was a consultant for the show, so that's probably part of why it's there). The kind of mentalism Derren Brown does interests me because of the necessity for reading body language and understanding people.

In trying to repair my brain from years of whatever kind of abuse and neglect have left it so vacant, I feel that the intense concentration it would take to develop and maintain a memory palace would help me focus on many other aspects of my life. Even if I only spend an hour a day working on it, that’s an hour I’m not just passively listening to the TV.

TL;DR: What else should I read/watch/listen to in order to help develop a memory palace?

I am fairly satisfied with what I have done, certainly enough for making those 30 min worth listening, even if there is still this little voice in my head saying that I could have done more =) But I am not really confident with my oral skills, I already had to perform such presentations 3-4 times in the past, I was fairly good but it's not the exercise that makes me feel the more at ease. So I'd like to know about tips, things I could improve in these few days, for example projecting more my voice which is one of my flaws. Thank you in advance.

I want to know how people live life with purpose by triggering themselves into action *consistently* and when the going gets tough.  

I'm wondering how people get beyond that dragging moment.  This is domination when laziness strikes.  People getting into an everyday routine.  Most importantly, on the long run how people become successful because they've consistently worked everyday to be themselves.  This is beyond motivating yourself to lurch forward, it's the actual *everyday* pushing action I'm asking about.

What little things help you?  Does /r/motivateme and quotes help you everytime you're about to be the slacker?  Kicking babies?.. puppies?  Does one work better than the other? Breathing techniques?  Does having an everyday routine, timeslotting/ a scheduler help you?  Does having one thing you're good at keep you going with always having a project to do?

a) I find it very hard/don't know how to loosen up and just enjoy myself and the music when I'm surrounded by other people. I can be pretty self conscious. I meditate almost daily and try to focus on myself and the music but it's hard anyway.

b) Because of (a), I've never really learned how to dance what I want to dance.

I don't want to dance a ""formal dance"", like tango or salsa ([example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDZVc8xpntI&amp;feature=related))... actually the dance I want to do is a kind of generic club dance... not grinding, just have fun while actually knowing how to move, but not needing to be constantly thinking about it, because that's no fun..

I really want to be able to just dance all night without worrying about what other people are thinking. I see all these people dancing and having fun and having these awesome, sexual, fun connections with each other when they dance... I really crave that kind of fun dancing.

Taking classes is out of the question, and I find that just trying to learn while at the club is just too much for me right now. Thoughts?

I'm a freshman in college who's slowly getting out of a shitty period of my life. The last 3-5 years were not very fun, and to summarize- looking back, I feel as if I lived someone's else life. I was timid, shy, scared, complacent, and lazy. I've spent the last few months getting my shit together. I'm doing well in school, feel physically and emotionally better, but still have pangs of regret.

I entered college under my parents wishes, majored in something I shouldn't have, and went to school because I fucked around in HS, and it was the only option I had. My mindset and goals have changed a lot. I'm excited about the future- I have short term goals such as finishing a book, or learning a new technique in a martial arts, and longer term goals such as transferring to a school that has programs I'm interested in, learning to write better, and overall becoming the man I want to be. 

It's great to finally be on a path I want to. I can't help but feel shitty for all the time I wasted. Sometimes, I treat my past as a debt; if I get things right in the future, then I've succeeded in making up for my early mistakes. Ultimately, I don't know how to deal with regret. I can deal with failure, but it's something about missed opportunities that drives me crazy.

I don't know if other people experience this, but I've recently come to have a fairly intense feeling of self-loathing stemming from not being able to stop seeing people as resources. It even seems to happen with people I'm close to. I see them for what they can do for ME instead of as people. It's an incredibly unhealthy habit to get in, and it's, of course, not universal to every person in every situation. 

Call it being self-centered. Call it being a horrible person. I want to fix it. 

Example: I meet a random nice girl at a bar. We hit it off but she only wants to be friends. I keep talking with her and having fun, but I can feel myself losing interest (or worse, trying to win her over into liking me). Maybe she mentions she has a cute friend, knows someone in my industry or turns out to know a lot about my subjects of interest - suddenly I'm interested again!

I hate being this sort of person, but I'm not sure what steps to take to be better. Has anyone else felt this or does anyone have advice on breaking these bad habits?

(Yes I see the irony of this being a long post about me... don't know what to say other than ""crap"".)

Whenever I have a decent amount, I always tell myself to not spend it on redundant things, such as gadgets or food I don't need.

I know how it all works, I know why I do it and essentially know how to stop it, but I never seem to succeed at doing it. The impulse disorder makes addictions for me only harder because the instant an impulse tells me to buy or do something, I do it without the proper analysing.

Well, I got to college and as it turned out, I really enjoyed the times I had in math classes, and specifically my business classes in microeconomics (I'm a marketing major, so I had to take these classes on my own). 
Anyway, I'm graduating now and I've got a job lined up for the next two years, and I really want to take this time to embrace a self-education about Economics and Math, enough where I can be reasonably competent.

My goals:
To teach myself enough mathematics to work out undergraduate-level quantitative economic problem sets.

To teach myself enough about micro and macro economic theories to help me understand how and why people interact the way they do.

To, at the end of two years, be on the right path towards completing a ""self-studying"" of economic theory.

My Methods (So far):
-MIT's Open Courseware: They have a really thorough microeconomic class, and then some scatterings of others.

-Kahn Academy: The math they offer goes all the way through calculus (introductory I imagine) and Linear Algebra. Would this be enough for a good start?

-Wealth of Nations: I figure this book seemed to start a lot about modern economics, so it couldn't hurt to read?

Evaluation Methods:
Old high school AP exams

What I need:

What books do I need to read?
What ways can I practice my mathematics?
How can I evaluate my progress?
What web sources are available?
Who can I talk to?

I know there is a ton I have to learn, but doing the digging I have so far has really spurned my interest more in the subject, not less. The ""dismal science"" appears to be something everyone should have a knowledge of, and any advice that I can get to help me get there would rock."	t5_2rjo5	True

I'm convinced it's holding me back, and my logic goes something like ""It'd be better to do something I'm suited for instead then, instead of wasting time on something that just isn't my thing."""	t5_2rjo5	True

EDIT: Wow, thank you so very much all for all the helpful comments! I sure have something to go after now. Thanks again."	t5_2rjo5	True

I would like to start exercising in the morning, but I feel so utterly drained AT LEAST until noon. No matter how much I sleep and no matter how healthy my diet is, I just can't bring myself to do anything intense in the morning.

I can force myself to do the actual exercises, but I won't be performing anywhere near my maximum effort. So it doesn't seem like there's any point doing it then."	t5_2rjo5	True
1343162420.0	x3c45	IWTL how to make a self improvement regimen that is effective, one that I know I will stick with.	TheyAreOnlyGods	62	12	12	"In the past I had moments of irrational empowerment followed by crushing depression. Each new time I grew less sure of my ability to improve myself. 

My biggest enemies are not laziness, or even the difficulty of improvement; it's the unsurety. 

It's the thought that maybe I am doing it incorrectly, or that I am not improving. Nothing is worse for me then seeing no end, no achievable results. I know life isn't 'do this for six months, achieve muscles', but I need a general idea of my pace of improvement, and what goal I will reach. I once crossed 200 miles through the Arizonan desert, and only because I knew there was an end out there eventually.

Anyways, I want to come up with an all-encompassing self improvement regimen, which touches on the following things;

**Physical Improvemnent**: I am in decent shape now, but I want to get stronger so I feel confident in my ability to protect myself and those I love. That being said, I also need to improve my quickness, accuracy, and ability to fight

**Learning Improvement**: I love learning, which is why I love reddit. I once read that we could be experts on everything if we spent as much time dicking around online as we did self-learning. I already read a lot online, and use my time well, but I want to have some weekly or biweekly in-depth self-learning schedule, each week dedicated to a subject that interests me.

**Cognitive Improvement**: To improve my mental quickness. Again, I read and write a lot, but I want more. I want to be able to increase my memory, my ability to orate, and my ability to solve logical problems.

**Social Improvement**: I am not going to lie; I used to be the suavest guy around. I could entertain large groups of girls and act supremely confident. But then I had a huge depression which consumed a year of my life, and almost took the rest of it several times. As a result, I have lost my ability to just approach a random girl and not feel weird. I want to regain my confidence not only with women, but in general as well.

I know this is pretty ambitious, but I have lots of time and I want to spend it as efficiently and productively as possible.

Any ideas of how to put this all together in a way that works, and is relatively easy to stick to?

EDIT: for clarity, I am not asking that you make it for me, just that you give some guidelines on how to make a successful one, although if you could make an example one that would be helpful."	t5_2rjo5	True

1339353780.0	uuvv9	IWTL better control over my facial expressions	transdermalcelebrity	65	13	18	"Maybe those with any acting or modelling experience or the like might have some advice. I've been told that I have a very expressive face and a pretty smile. However I often feel like I have difficult controlling my facial expressions or having normal facial expressions when I'm not thinking about it.   

I grew up with an autistic big brother and too often I actually see myself making expressions similar to what I see him too (not normal). I will do things like scrinch up my face as if I need to squint when I don't (20/20 vision), often in pictures my smile will look a little off -as if I'm clenching my jaw or there's something fake going on.

Are there some kind of exercises out there for better control over facial muscles?"	t5_2rjo5	True
