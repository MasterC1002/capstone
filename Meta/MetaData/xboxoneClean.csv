[Your Feedback Matters](http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/update)

---

I'm sick of seeing all the misinformation going around the gaming subreddits. It's really frustrating to see people furiously hating the X1 without having all, if any, of the details. I'll try and break this down for you guys so here we go.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To start off, the Xbox One will allow you to buy games at launch through digital download or through discs by going to a retail store. 

**USED GAMES**

One of the X1's main feature is the ability to install the disc directly to the hard drive and play it without a disk. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is a feature many asked for when the feature was added to 360, but it was only to allow the game to run better.

Contrary to popular believe, the used game *does* exist in the X1. 

""Trade-in and resell your disc-based games: Today, some gamers choose to sell their old disc-based games back for cash and credit. We designed Xbox One so game publishers can enable you to trade in your games at participating retailers. Microsoft does not charge a platform fee to retailers, publishers, or consumers for enabling transfer of these games.""

What can we take away from this? Easy. If you bought a disc based game, you can sell and trade it to any participating retailer. It means that game publishers will work out deals with retailers in order for the developers and publishers to take a cut of used games sales. Microsoft will *not* receive any money from these transactions. If you bought a digital copy, just like any digital copy, you will not be able to do this. 

***FIRST PARTY GAMES***

""In our role as a game publisher, Microsoft Studios will enable you to give your games to friends or trade in your Xbox One games at participating retailers. Third party publishers may opt in or out of supporting game resale and may set up business terms or transfer fees with retailers. Microsoft does not receive any compensation as part of this. In addition, third party publishers can enable you to give games to friends. Loaning or renting games won’t be available at launch, but we are exploring the possibilities with our partners.""

All first party games will be allowed to be resold and be given away (more of this below). 

***RENTING GAMES***

""Loaning or renting games won’t be available at launch, but we are exploring the possibilities with our partners.""

Microsoft and companies such as Gamefly are working on a system to make this work. 

---------------------------

**DRM--WHY?**

As we saw above, you will be able install your games to your hard-drive and have your entire library available to play without putting the disc in the disc tray. 

This is why the 24-hour check is required. Without this, many copies of the same game could be installed into multiple X1's and it would be absolutely crumble game sales. 

The drawback to this is not being able to game offline. Microsoft has said that the final decisions to this issue have not been final. I believe if they allow you to play offline with the disc in the disc tray, this would become a non-issue. 

-----------------------

**PRIVACY**

This is one of the biggest things people have been complaining about. Microsoft has already addressed the issue, but of course it fell on deaf ears. People already had their pitch forks out and had Sony on a pedestal by this point. 

""You are in control of when Kinect sensing is On, Off or Paused: If you don’t want the Kinect sensor on while playing games or enjoying your entertainment, you can pause Kinect. To turn off your Xbox One, just say “Xbox Off.” When the system is off, it’s only listening for the single voice command -- “Xbox On,” and you can even turn that feature off too. Some apps and games may require Kinect functionality to operate, so you’ll need to turn it back on for these experiences.""

As I've stated before, you will have the control to everything that the Kinect has to offer. If you don't want it to hear you? You can do that. If you don't want it to see you, you can do that. Don't want it to listen for the ""Xbox On"" while it's off, you can also do that. 

If you want to learn more about the Kinect's privacy settings, you can click this link: [Kinect Privacy](http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/privacy)

-----------------------

**XBOX ONE- A GAME OF CIRCLES**

Now onto the other things. As some of us know, you will be able to have a ""circle"" of friends, 10 people to be exact, that will be able to access your game library from anywhere (in the same region, I'm assuming..still not clear about this) at anytime (as long as you or someone else in your circle isn't playing it). This is of course how things work now, two of your friends can't play the game at the same time from one disc on two separate consoles. 

This is a feature that is absolutely wonderful, but the people raging about it had not heard about it before. 

""Give your family access to your entire games library anytime, anywhere: Xbox One will enable new forms of access for families. Up to ten members of your family can log in and play from your shared games library on any Xbox One. Just like today, a family member can play your copy of Forza Motorsport at a friend’s house. Only now, they will see not just Forza, but all of your shared games. You can always play your games, and any one of your family members can be playing from your shared library at a given time.""

I absolutely love this feature. For example, my cousin is 200 miles away when he's away to college and I've let him borrow LA Noire and Dead Rising. I've yet to receive those games from him. With this feature, we don't have to be close in order for him to borrow any of my games! It's crazy as to how so many people dismissed this feature because it's a big jump forward in digital technology. No longer will my friends or family have to be close to me in order for them borrow one of my games. 

*Important Update:* New information has risen relating to this feature. You +1 friend from your circle can play the same game at the same time. Others can still play from your other library selection. 

[SOURCE]( https://mobile.twitter.com/nowak911/status/345297685743534080)

*Another Important Update:* DLC will be shareable through your circle. Your friend will be able to play all of the DLC that you buy. They will not need to purchase their own DLC for the game they're playing from your Xbox One.

-------------------------------------------------

**GIVING AWAY GAMES**

Do you have a game that you will no longer play? Your friend can still play it off of your Xbox (if they're in your circle). What if they're not? As long as they have been in your friend's list for 30 days, you can give a game away to your friend, *free of charge!* This can only be done once per copy. 

*Disclaimer: Microsoft has left it up to the publishers to decide whether or not you will be able to give your games to your friend. As stated above, first party games will allow you to this.*

------------------------------------

**AFTER-THOUGHT: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**

The big change in the Xbox Live system is the feature to allow all users on one console to have gold by just one user having it. For example, if I have Xbox Live Gold and my brothers also use the same console, they will also be able to use all the perks of a Gold account. They will have access to all the games on the console even if it was installed through my account. 

In short, one Gold account subscription per Xbox.

----------------------------------

**AFTER-THOUGHT OF AN AFTER-THOUGHT, A KINECT STORY**

*Disclaimer, the following is information that I believe. I have no source for some, just my opinion.*

The main question I'm seeing is why the Kinect is being forced upon us. This is what I believe is the case in relation to this matter. 

The past version of the Kinect was not the big leap in innovating that Microsoft wanted. It is a powerful machine, but many developers were not making games for it. The games that were being made specifically for the Kinect we really not that great. They didn't appeal to many gamers as they were soft and childish. This wasn't what Microsoft was looking for from developers. 

Why weren't developers making games for the Kinect? Was it because they couldn't?

***A CHANGE OF MARKETS***

If a developer made a game for the Kinect, their market instantly became much smaller. Why? Not everyone has a Kinect. As of February 2013, the Kinect has sold an estimated 24 million units. This *does not* mean that these units have been sold to individual customers, but to retailers. Which means that there are Kinects in the shelves or warehouses that will never reach the individual customer. In comparison, the 360 has sold an estimated 77.2 million units, again not all sold to invidual customers, but it's safe to assume that there a lot more 360's in the hand of an individual customer than there is Kinects. In an instant, your market shrinks to about 31% of the possible market. Keep in mind, this number will change depending on how many units of each product have been sold to each consumer. 

With that information given to you, what I believe is happening is simple. Microsoft is shipping a Kinect with every console because like this, if you own an Xbox One--you will aso own a Kinect. With this, I'm thinking Microsoft is ensuring the developers that the market is out there! In this move, Microsoft want the developers to explore the possibilities of the Kinect. They want newer innovations as they believe they've made a product with enormous potential. Why do you believe they were shoving the Kinect down everyone's throat last E3? They wanted to expand their market. 

Just think of everything that can be developed for the Kinect. For example, Dead Rising 3 will have a feature where it will listen outside of the game through the Kinect. If you make a loud sound while playing, the zombies *will hear you* and they will come after you. This is the kind of thing Microsoft is looking for with the Kinect, innovation.


As to why it can't be disconnected, that I'm not sure. Maybe it's for the same thing? I can't expand further on this. 

----------------------------------


With this, we are done with explaining the information that a lot have missed and hopefully will be able to see that the Xbox One really isn't what they think.

 * Over 300,000 servers will be running this year for Xbox One.
  * Their specific use is for ""latency-insensitive computation"" in Xbox One games.
     * Lag is avoided because it will not compute things which are latency sensitive, such as:
         * Animations in shooter
         * Shots in a game
         * Reaction to collisions
     * It will compute things that are latency-insensitive, such as:
         * Lighting
         * Volumetric fog
         * Physics modeling
         * Fluid dynamics
         * Cloth motion
     * Computations are handled upfront by cloud servers while adding no lag to gameplay.
     * Essentially for seamless experience, Xbox will handle intro computations, Cloud catches up, and then takes over
     * ""This is never going to work because everyones internet can go out eventually!""
         * While you are connected, the cloud will do it's job. If your internet goes out, and it always does, ""the game is going to handle that intelligently""
         * Description of intelligent handling to come soon
  * ""**A rule of thumb we like to use is that for ever Xbox One available in your living room, we'll have three of those devices in the cloud**""

##4. Start Playing Immediately After Installation Begins [^[source, ^Xbox.com]](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xboxone/what-it-is)
 * Games install in the background while you play them.

 * Worlds will continue to change/update while you're offline.
 * Game worlds stay in sync with the real world (sports, racing, fighting, etc.).

##7. Xbox One SmartMatch [^[source, ^Major ^Nelson's ^Blog]](http://majornelson.com/2013/06/11/xbox-one-smart-match/)
 * Gives you the ability to find matches for games in the background.
 * Xbox lets you do anything until your match is ready.
 * Xbox games will show you ""typical wait times"" for other Xbox games.
 * You can choose in-depth SmartMatch options such as ""search by DLC"".
 * Game titles can allow SmartMatch to sort by specific attributes such as (but not limited to) specific skills, age, or language.

##8. Reputation [^[source, ^Major ^Nelson's ^Blog]](http://majornelson.com/2013/06/11/xbox-one-smart-match/)
 * ""Survey"" style feedback system was removed and replaced with more advanced feedback system.
 * Feedback is direct to the player, even muting or blocking is taken into account.
 * All feedback is calculated by the Reputation service to evaluate a player's social reputation.
 * Just like insurance, the longer you go without causing trouble the better your Reputation will be.
 * Green is good, you don't want to get the ""Avoid Me"" Reputation.
 * Your social Reputation can easily be seen on your Gamercard.
 * SmartMatch can work to match bad players with other bad players if their Reputation is low enough.
 * Microsoft will issue you alerts as you move down in Reputation rank (*Good*, *Needs Improvement*, *Avoid Me*).

##9. Achievements [^[source, ^Major ^Nelson's ^Blog]](http://majornelson.com/2013/06/12/xbox-one-achievements/)
 * Along with Gamerscore, players can now unlock digital artwork, characters, and stats through achievements.
 * Applications and media can now take advantage of awarding console users achievments (will not affect Gamerscore).
 * Achievements and Challenges:
  * There are now challenges, in addition to achievements.
  * Achievements are not changing, will remain the same.
  * Challenges are opportunities that can come and go; They can be a goal or reward.
  * Challenges can be used to unlock things during a specific time.
  * Similarities:
     * You can unlock them and win their rewards.
     * Once unlocked, they are saved to your achievement history.
     * They each have an icon to visualize the cool thing you did.
     * They often are associated with a Game DVR capture to show your friends that you are better than they are.
     * Developers can release more of them after the game’s initial release (more on that in a bit).
  * Differences:
     * **Challenges are time based.** As just noted, challenges are only available for a certain period of time. Only your activity during that timeframe will count toward unlocking the challenge. Achievements do not expire, so you can unlock them at your leisure.

     * **Challenges do not give out Gamerscore.** We want everyone to have the same shot at increasing their Gamerscore to its highest potential. Since challenges are intentionally temporary (an opportunity) and achievements never expire (a promise), only achievements may offer Gamerscore as a reward.

     * **Challenges may cross titles, but achievements cannot.** Achievements cannot be shared across titles whereas challenges are allowed to span multiple titles.

     * **Challenges can be unlocked by the community.** Community challenges are typically goals that exceed what a lone player can accomplish in the given period of time. Imagine, for example, a game releases a headshot weekend challenge that requires players to cumulatively headshot 1 million baddies in a 3 day period. And every person who participates and meets the challenge’s goals gets the unlock on his or her achievement history and reaps its reward.
  * Achievements run on the cloud, allowing these features:
     * Allows Developers to run challenges across all players of a game simultaneously.
     * Developers can continue to add achievements after initial game release.
     * Get new achievements without being forced to purchase new content.
     * Lets developers monitor statistics of achievements and can respond with content to the interest of those players.
     * Most importantly, this allows developers to involve the community in the development.

###Hardware

##2. Xbox One Console [^[source, ^Xbox.com]](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xboxone/meet-xbox-one)
 * Comes with:
  * Xbox One console
  * Kinect sensor
  * Wireless controller
  * HDMI Cable
 * ""Xbox One's RAM is accessible as a unified chunk"".
  * RAM can be controlled and divided up between GPU and CPU dynamically.
     * This allows different games and applications to allocate what's needed, rather than trying to predetermine ahead of time how much RAM should be given to each component (GPU, CPU, Audio).
     * Microsoft doesn't want to make assumptions, assumptions lead to limiting developers from the beginning.

##4. Xbox One Kinect
 * Kinect is required to physically be connected to Xbox One.
 * Matt Booty on why Kinect is required:
  *  ""From a design point of view, we don't see [the Kinect] as something that would be separate from Xbox One itself."" Booty implied that the Kinect could have even been built into the Xbox One casing, if not for concerns about players wanting the Kinect and the Xbox One in slightly different places in their living rooms. ""It just happens to be in a different plastic housing, and I think that's just because of location.""
  * Think of computers, you would never see one without a mouse or keyboard (we're not talking tablets here). The same thing is being done with Kinect, it's an integral part of the Xbox system
 * By knowing all Xbox One's have Kinect, developers ""are going to find all kinds of new things to do with it because they don’t have to worry about it being a unique accessory or something that only a small portion of the user base has""
 * They're making the Kinect just as much of a standard as a camera in a phone, or a touchpad on a laptop."	t5_2xbci	True

He messaged support before the Sony conference so the employee did not realize that Day One Xbox Live was not included with the Day One Console. They obviously wouldn't be given any information before the reveal so nothing leaked and just misunderstood.

This is just like the sites that originally said that the all of the Day One games came with the Day one edition, just a misunderstanding due to not enough information being released.

1373681417.0	1i71s5	I am an Xbox One dev. Ask me almost anything.	XboxOneDev	636	216	740	"Obvious throwaway account. I won't be providing any proof or confirming/disproving rumors or anything that may give my identity away. Which is why I'm doing this in this subreddit. Believe what you will on what I say.

As an Xbox One OS dev, my brethens and I live and breath this stuff. We're salaried but anyone putting in 60hrs/week is nothing to brag about. Pull an all nighter from time to time, we feel good and give each other high fives. We take pride in our work and still have high hopes for what's yet to come. That being said, it's not like we don't read around the internet on what everyone is saying about the Xbox One, our policies, and our company. We do take the time to think about our policies, re-evaluate, and re-confirm that we're making logical and well thought out decisions. Honestly, a lot of us don't care about the bickering that's going on everywhere and all the time about which console is better. Personally, I just care about delivering the Xbox One with a quality bar that gamers deserve, that we deserve, because we're going to be playing this console too. I'm going to be putting one in my living room and enjoy the hell out of what this amazing piece of tech has to offer.

I'm doing this AMA because when I joined this subreddit, it was to see what reasons do people who agree with our vision give to support their choice. What games are people excited about? What innovative ways can people come up with to use the Kinect that we haven't thought of? Of course, to see people cheer for the product that I live my life in. More often than not, what I see are people who don't support the Xbox One spreading false information, albeit unintentionally. People talking like they're an expert on this stuff and but having not a single clue. This leads to the Xbox One fans frantically defending Microsoft and/or its policies, sometimes with more false information due to the mess of a job we did at revealing the console. Some of the reasons people voice against the Xbox One, I really don't understand. Maybe it's because I work so closely to the console, I know exactly how it works and why certain things are simply ridiculous. I don't know.

So ask me almost anything. If I don't reply, it most likely means to fully answer you I'll have to break NDA.

Edit: Exchanged proof to mods for custom flair.

**Edit: As some one pointed out to me I should be more clear about my intent for being here. There's no way I can answer some of these questions without someone else on the team reading it and saying, ""I know exactly who this guy is."" All I can offer is insight on our culture, the way we think, and what why we implemented some of our policies.**

**Edit: Thank you all for coming here. Sorry I couldn't get to a lot of you as there are just too many questions. That and I really can't answer a lot of these. Though this ama I think now looks like a giant handbook of questions the public is interested in knowing as well as which topics are people more unclear on by show of the debates. Be assured the entire team will continue to work hard during this final stretch. Our goal is to deliver the XBox One with one of the best experiences you will ever enjoy.**"	t5_2xbci	True

1371828553.0	1gsrf5	"How developers use ""the cloud"" and Halo will have a large cloud computing presence. Tech news sites report on Xbox one cloud details for years. game blogs still haven't caught up."	clisby	365	82	185	"I have discussed the IaaS and PaaS benefits in many threads before, but find that many still are still hesitant about the computational effectiveness of the Azure cloud. Gamers have been left out of the loop, the Azure cloud and even the Xbox one implementation has not been really covered on anything other than straight tech sites.Rather than spoon-feed, I'm going to go straight into using cloud processing/storage directly from the Xbox one.  Many of you are only here for Halo.  ctrl+f if that's all you are interested in, no judging.

tl;dr **Microsoft revolutionized the way developers access cloud computing resources.  This is revolutionizing the world, and we get it in our freaking game console.**
Microsoft provides the [Common Language Runtime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime) to facilitate easy programming for Windows.  It handles the complex and sticky stuff such as managing execution of the program, memory management, type safety and exception handling.  It worried, mostly, about resources on the local machine -- CPU, RAM, etc.  Until now, there was no equivalent for easily executing and divvying up operations to cloud resources.  Rolling your own code to do this is cost-prohibitive and not worth it for nearly any company to develop.  The only reason it is for MS is because it will be integrated into over [90% of the home computers in the world, not including enterprise and mobile systems] (http://www.zdnet.com/latest-os-share-data-shows-windows-still-dominating-in-pcs-7000013351/)Microsoft changed the game by introducing a new model, a CLR equivalent, for their Azure cloud.    

tl;dr **The new system is called Orleans and it makes accessing cloud computing storage and processing power just as straight-forward as local resources.**
Microsoft's new cloud programming model is called Orleans and has been in development for a few years.  It organizes units of computation and storage as ""grains"" that can seemlessly migrate between datacenters.  It ensures consistency and replication.  It manages debugging, performance monitoring, deployment, configuration and maintenance.  It's *simple*(incredibly important).  It uses .NET languages which are easy enough to teach an elementary school kid in a week, yet robust enough to have developed some of the world's most complex enterprise software.

Halo is being developed *for the cloud*, and they haven't even told gamers yet and have been for at least a year and a half now.  Shh.  [This was reported to ZDNet months ago](http://www.zdnet.com/microsofts-orleans-cloud-programming-model-gets-a-halo-test-drive-7000009300/).

&gt; Artificial intelligence, [..]doesn’t need to be calculated for every single frame of the game. Your enemy in a game will close in on you, but it only needs to know where you are every second, rather than every split second. So that task can be offloaded to the slower connection to the servers.

For the last 40+ years we have incrementally improved graphics through better local hardware.  We have been adding cores, increasing clock speed, upping RAM etc.  We can easily understand this upgrade.  The Xbox one's cloud capabilities are difficult to explain and, as you could imagine, had Microsoft spent any time at E3 explaining the above things the damage would have been even worse.  Orleans, free Azure resources and deep integration into the Xbox one will assuredly create new experiences.  I am positive, after we experience and witness the benefits of the cloud, we will spend less time worrying about a few cores.  This cloud will become stronger and more efficiently used.  Microsoft dumps over $9 billion worth of money just to *research* cloud capabilities.  If you read their whitepapers, they put a heavy emphasis on cloud technologies that are going to benefit the Xbox one.  It's truly an exciting time we live in, where we get to say billions of dollars are being spent every year by one company to improve their console.  Microsoft spends more R&amp;D, just on the cloud, than their competitors (console and PC) spend on their *entire R&amp;D projects across all offerings*(I don't have more recent figures [than this](http://gizmodo.com/5486798/research-and-development-apple-vs-microsoft-vs-sony)).  We could be angry about DRM, digital, the removal, etc.  That's OK - just don't fall into the trap of ""Microsoft doesn't care about us"" and that any money you give them hurts gamers.  Microsoft spends 17% of their profits on research and development, more than any of their direct competitors in any marketspace.  Know the extra $100 is not simply for the Kinect.  When Microsoft says they are over-delivering value for the price, this is why.    

It's worth noting, and I'll post another time, that Microsoft pulled over their top visionaries and engineers to solely focus on Xbox development.  This includes pioneers of the cloud industry and **they even dedicated the chief architect or ""father"" of Windows NT/2000/2003 to Xbox**.  This guy was given the distinction of ""Technical Fellow"" which only 22 employees in all of Microsoft's history have achieved.  They gave him *to us*. They then moved over the Azure hypervisor director to the Xbox group.  Gamers are being taken seriously both for the PS4 and Xbox one.  It's a marvelous time to be a gamer.

Don't see why this hasn't happened here, yet. It seems like everyone has quite a few questions and I think they would be nice to get cleared up on an AMA with him. But let's ask questions that can actually be answered as well without PR restrictions we already know about... 

My questions:

* I saw a [Kinect tech demo with Wired where Scott Evans whips out a zebra custom colored Xbox One controller](http://youtu.be/Hi5kMNfgDS4?t=4m22s). Any chance we'll see custom controllers (aside from the Day One Edition) from Microsoft at launch? If not, will we see any before holiday?

* When browsing the Xbox Live Marketplace, I noticed that there are no Game of the Year editions of games or an option to buy one. Is there a chance we can see this implemented in the Xbox One's Marketplace? If anything have an option to purchase either one version or the other. I wouldn't mind paying 10-20 extra dollars to have a digital GOTY of a two year old game versus buying the standard copy and having to purchase DLC's separate.

* Another Marketplace question; Can we expect to see some system that allows you to build a cart and a wishlist? I would love to buy my sibling and friends games and I saw your response to someone stating that there most likely will be a gifting system. I would love to surprise them by knocking a game or two off a wishlist.

* Can we have more in depth knowledge on how the audio of the One? How customizable will audio settings be? If I'm playing Call of Duty multiplayer, I'd like to keep my bass levels low and have my mids stand out more. And if this can be adjusted, will be see these settings be implemented upon game or app startup so I don't have to toggle audio everytime I switch games?

* Which Xbox One exclusive are you most excited for?

* **Bonus Question:** Would you be my 101st friend when the Xbox One comes out? *Edit:* Actually better yet, I'd totally add you as a friend now.

If he does the AMA that'd be great, if not that's understandable. I think it'd also be a good opportunity to get in some input on some things we'd like to see for the Xbox One. Who knows, maybe they can flip some switches.

Boxfortsuprise	481	240	337	"Last night I was at wings with some buddies, and we got onto the topic of the PS4 vs the Xbox One. I had always loved xbox, but recently after being on reddit and hearing all the terrible things about it, I was ready to convert. That was when my friend started asking me why?
ME: Well you always have to be online!

Him: so, you always are!

Me: okay well, you can't lend out games!!

Him: yes you can, you just can't play it while the person is. Which is exactly like what happens anyways. Like when you let me borrow Far Cry 3, you already beat it, so you didn't care that you couldn't play it, so you let me borrow it. That's exactly what happens.

Me:oh, uhh well the kinect is always on!

Him: So, do you really care?

Me: no, well, there's not as many exclusives!!

Him: You only play NCAA football, Halo, and the odd other big title game, do you really care about that?

This went on a little while longer until I realized I was beat, I actually had nothing to go on just things that I had picked up on /r/gaming. I told him I would do some research and actually investigate my own opinion. So I googled articles about the Xbox one, and sure enough, in each article everything made sense. As I went back to reddit, there was a link on /r/bestof about the Xbox one. After reading it, I had a light bulb moment, I had been sucked into the mob mentality without doing any actual research for myself, I let everyone else make the judgment call for me. I am now proud to say I am back on the Xbox one band wagon. I just wish people would do the research for themselves rather then let memes, and hate articles do it for them.

TL;DR: Let the mob speak for me, when I should've just done the research.

1374803210.0	1j2igv	List of Kinect features I have seen that are worthy of excitement.	XboxOneDev	234	42	183	"I’m making this post because I am still seeing quite a few questions on what features the Kinect can offer. This is a list of things announced related to Kinect that I think are notable. Be it something for UI navigation or actual in game usage.

**Console**

-	UI navigation with hand gestures. You can flip, grab, drag, and push.

-	UI navigation with voice commands. “xbox on,” “go home,” “snap Skype,” “watch TV,” “play game” are some of the commands you can use. There are tons more.

-	Identity recognition. After you sign in the first time, the Kinect will remember your face, associate it with your live account and can automatically sign you in when you walk in front of the Kinect and pick up a controller. This enables an array of features such as automatically loading your favorites, your settings, your list of games, etc.

-	Controller recognition. This works in junction with identity. Each controller is bound to the player holding it. There was a question asked about removal of the LED rings and not being able to tell who is player X. It doesn’t matter which controller you are using. The console handles it and recognizes where you and your friends are in the room and adjusts accordingly. We can even tell when one person is holding more than one controller.

**Gaming**

Some of the games announced for launch have been pretty revealing on what features they are using. Some people are still saying they haven’t seen any Kinect features in games. Well they’re right, the games are not out yet. But it's not a question of whether game devs will use the Kinect, it's how are they are using them.

Most of these are focusing on subtle controls in addition to using the controller.

**Ryse** – Voice commands to control legions of soldiers.

**Dead Rising 3** – There’s a lot of info on how DR3 is running with this. Zombies can hear you, wriggle away from zombies by shaking your controller, point at an area and use voice commands to control survivors.

**Killer Instinct** – You and your buddy sit in front of the Xbox, grab controllers, you are both automatically signed in. Your separate customizations and loadouts are ready and you go straight to fighting.

There was a demo shown at E3 called *Reflex*. This is an FPS game made in house to showcase how Kinect can be used. 

-	You’re shooting targets as usual, suddenly you’re outnumbered and enemies are shooting at you from all over the place. Raise your controller to chest level and your shield pops up. They can't hurt you now and you own them. 

- Wait! Invisible enemies are shooting at you! Good thing your helmet has an XRAY vision module. You touch your right temple to activate it. Now you can see them and you waste them.

-	Giant obstacles are flying at you while you sprint across a stretch of land. Lean left or right with your body and you strafe/dodge/roll accordingly. You are too quick.

-	You’re shooting at flying enemies and these guys are tough. Your puny gun can’t penetrate their armor. Except you have rockets. Raise your finger and point at each of the targets to lock on and you say, “fire missiles.” [Something like this happens.](http://imgur.com/eU0qJ7v) 

Most of the game devs ping us when they need help with specific Kinect problems, and we don't expect them to share what they are doing for their games. These are companies that haven't announced a game yet. The fact that they are asking tells me there are features in the works. I believe we’re just at the tip of discovering what games can do with the Kinect.

The fact that i don't have to sit in a GameStop parking lot for a few hours in line with other people at midnight, then drive home just to play a game is awesome. I can just stay home and download it once it comes out!

I don't care that i cant loan games to friends because all my friends play the same game as i do. But now i don't have to get up and switch games when i want to play something else or when my wife forgot to take a movie out that she was watching. I've had to rebuy at least 3 games the past few years because they were either lost or misplaced. No more of that now!!

Also i don't have to have all these different remotes on my night stand just so i can switch between the TV and my Xbox!

Lets give it up for Microsoft people, they are making life easier for people and i for one support them with what they are doing. They have given me everything i want!!

1375976600.0	1jym1y	The truest comment I found today on IGN:	rnarkus	245	55	183	"nickomatic666:

""How this gen has worked:

consumer: ""If Microsoft takes away DRM I'll probably get one.""

MS: ""We have taken away our DRM policies""

consumer: ""still not buying, they shouldn't have done it in the first place.""


consumer: ""If Microsoft changed their indie policie i would probably buy one""

MS: ""we have changed our indie policy and all consoles will be dev kits""

consumer: ""Still not buying, i don't even like indie games""


consumer: ""if they included a headset i would probably buy one""

MS: ""We will be including a headset with the xbox one""

consumer: ""still not buying, xbox one has a power brick""


And people wonder why Microsoft doesn't bother making changes to their ""flaws"".....""

1376351558.0	1k8qtl	Complete reversal of policy VS changes in policy	XboxOneDev	195	35	230	"Boy that Kinect not required to be plugged in announcement sure turned a lot of heads. I immediately saw a lot of responses that understood the intent of this change. While others, jumped to the (scary) thought of Microsoft selling a Kinect-less Xbox One in the future. I'll just say it is extremely unlikely this will happen. If it ever does, it'll be years and years down the road.

The point I want to make is every policy change we made since E3 aren't complete reversals/180s/make like the PS4. But rather tailor our policies to allow more choices and options while keeping most of our original vision intact. Our executives made it pretty clear that their ears were going to be wide open to listen to public feedback and so far I, for one, am quite pleased with recent announcements. 

Here are my thoughts:

**DRM Policy**  
**Change**: Xbox one no longer requires 24hr check in.  

**Effect**: Removal of 10 people family sharing plan. People can now play offline, trade disc games, sell used games.  

**Vision**: We are still pushing for a digital distribution model, we want people to have their games wherever they go and whenever. We want people to play a game while waiting for another game. We introduced the Home Gold program. One gold account, everyone on the console gets gold, on their own gamertags. One purchase, everyone in the family can play, on their own gamertags. You go to your friends house, all you need to do is sign in, and you and all your buddies can enjoy all your games.

**Included chat headset**  
**Change**: We are now including a headset in every box.

**Effect**: Everyone who doesn't want to use the Kinect to chat, don't have to.

**Vision**: We are still very confident in the Kinect's audio abilities. Including a chat headset allows the chat audio to be separated from game audio instead of everything all mixed together coming out of your TV.

**Kinect requirement**  
**Change**: The Kinect is no longer required to be plugged in at all times.

**Effect**: The Kinect is no longer required to be plugged in at all times.

**Vision**: This changes nothing about our original vision, and that is to guarantee to game developers 100% adoption rate of the Kinect. Every Xbox One will come with a Kinect. If game developers implement Kinect features in their games, everyone who has an Xbox One will be able to experience it. *Every Kinect feature you have heard about will not go away.* We already allow the Kinect to be completely turned off and no one will stop you from turning the Kinect around to face a wall or wrapped up in an audio dampening box. Apparently, this wasn't good enough for some people, so now you don't have to have it plugged in. If your Kinect ever breaks, your console will still work while you get a replacement. This is a good change."	t5_2xbci	True

The size and ergonomics are perfect, the thumbs feel even more natural than they already do on the 360.

The triggers are very nice, the force feedback inside each trigger really adds to the game. The demo they had running for the controllers gave examples of how the force feedback could be used in game. One example had the triggers kicking your fingers back during hard braking as if the ABS would kick back your foot on the pedal. The best way I can describe it is surround-force-feedback. It feels like it feedback flows through the controller

Really looking forward to this one, I wasn't expecting the controller to be this nice, the pictures don't do it justice

Firstly, it's a fricken GAMING machine. I'm seeing death threats, threats of physical violence, verbal abuse, harrassment, stalking - I can't believe people are worked up to such ridiculous levels about whether or not you support a GAMING machine or not. Is this a sign of the times? Is this what the internet has done? Given a voice to the hordes of uneducated morons that make themselves feel better by thinking they are a part of something (in this case, the cool online majority that hates xbox one?)

Secondly, it seems no where on the internet is safe to sit and talk favourably about xbox without the anti xbox squad raining holy hell fire down upon you. You sign up to the xbox forum, BANG, thousands of xbox haters. And not normal xbox fans saying hey ms, we love you but we're struggling with this - no. The extreme haters that have signed up solely to ensure the degrees of abuse and rage against xbox and xbox fans continue. Xbox facebook group - why the frack are you in a group that 'likes' the xbox one if you don't? Is it that important to you that you actively seek out people who do wanna spend some time talking about something THEY like, to the point that you sign up just to try and make them feel bad?

Thirdly, every(most) argument I see against the xbox is SO uninformed and the blatant spread of misinformation is incredible. People hating on people for things that are just not true. People don't wanna learn, they just want to abuse. It's past a point of liking or not liking a console to just having a reason to abuse people - and because it falls under a majority banner, people are OK with it. People are so uneducated about the things they are saying. Yeah I'm talking about that 16 year old idiot from some country across the world copying and pasting the middle finger up ascii to microsoft - even though he probably can't understand any of the text in the posts - just because it makes him look tough and everyone else is doing it. I understand there's things people don't like, and if you're against xbox and have strong feelings about why certain features upset you, fair enough. It's never going to please everyone. But people spewing the hatred they are with NO basis for the things they are saying is getting ridiculous.

Finally, so many people are hating based on principle. Online always? Hell no. Why should I have to do that? I'll never do that because you're making me. Instead of reading to learn why this is the way it is or how it may possibly be one of the biggest groundbreaking ideas we've seen, I'll hate it because I think I should get everything my way and I'll let the world know this is how I feel.

I have learned over this week that I hate people. I have never seen such a bad side to general society. I'm not talking about reasonable people who just don't favour the xbox, I'm not even talking about the people bagging out the xbox. I'm talking about the extremist idiots who are taking this to all corners of the internet just because it's the 'fad' at the moment to do so. If you're in this group, I hate you."	t5_2xbci	True

Single answers from XboxSupport have been used to confirm biases, both positive and negative, but they are far from a reliable source. This is tech support after all, and you wouldn't expect your average tech support guy who can be directly accessed by consumers to have a super secret company info that hasn't been released by MS themselves. They are maybe just one step ahead of us in receiving new news, but that would be it.

That said, XboxSupport is a wonderful source for tech support and have helped me out with several tech issues in the past. Go to them with any Xbox 360 issues you have; they'll likely be a huge help.

1373239044.0	1htu6x	[Announcement] Countdown to Launch: All About the Games	whatdoyouwantmetosay	134	25	44	"**Updated with this week's schedule**

Hello fellow gamers,

In an effort to bring a positive contribution to this sub, I would like to begin a weekday tradition of talking about, and focusing on, the different games that have been announced for the Xbox One.

There are approximately 50 games announced as of right now, and approximately 80 business days until November. If this is viewed as a positive and informative contribution, each weekday (M-F), a new game will be posted in an effort to give each game its time in the limelight.

[note: as of right now, the top post in /r/xboxone is a call for discussion on MGS5, so I believe there is interest in this]

-------------------

**Why?**

Right now we are in a stretch of time where news comes sparingly, or if you're a fan of sports, this is the preseason. The college football sub, /r/CFB, has filled this time by hosting a series of posts called 132+ teams in 132+ days, where each college football team is featured one day at a time, and I believe the format can carry over. See an example [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1ht4n3/132_teams_in_132_days_louisiana_ragin_cajuns/).

By offering up a designated day for each game, fans or people who are just curious about a game can drop in and ask questions, or just generally get pumped for a game.

-------------------------

**Formatting**

Structure can be good, as it offers a regular meeting place and will help centralize discussion. It can also be bad or seen as a negative, such as if someone subs to /r/xboxone in a few weeks and sees that they've missed out on a game they want to talk about, or if new information comes out for a game that we've already discussed.

Overall, it's not a perfect system but I believe it is a net positive for this sub.

&gt; **The first discussion will be for Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, starting Monday, July 8th.**

1372174274.0	1h1j2a	Opinion: Microsoft sees current competitors as a short-term battle. The real war will be Apple vs Valve vs Xbox One (wall of text ahoy!)	clisby	200	94	224	"**tl;dr The ""console war"" will be waged between Apple, Valve and Microsoft, Microsoft having an advantage over the other two.  Microsoft's strategy implies a head-on war with AppleTV and Steambox -- NOT Sony.  Sony is a short-term competitor Microsoft deals with to get an early advantage over Apple and Valve.**     

- **Apple** is a direct competitor to Microsoft in many markets (OS, mobile, multimedia device).  [AppleTV has been a very cheap multimedia TV add-on with surprising success](http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_ipod/ipod_accessories/apple_tv).  It is used to play digital content from its iTunes as well as some of the other expected providers such as Netflix, Hulu and YouTube.  [In the first 8 months it sold 6 million units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV#Sales) on-par with sales for previous generation systems.  It should be noted that while the box was exceptionally limited, it was still only $100.  If you can get past Objective-C(blech), suffice it to say Apple will make real-time console/mobile integration simple and a major feature.  They would have to jack up the specs of the AppleTV and, with the Apple tax+new controller, I have zero issue saying it would be $500+.  It would be using their iTunes marketplace with digital distribution.      

Points: Integration with Apple mobile and desktop devices, rich iTunes app market with convenient digital distribution, strong multimedia focus with access to already existing iTunes library

- The **SteamBox** is to use ""Big Picture Mode.""  The rumor describes it running a default configuration, but allows other manufacturers to produce ""steam boxes"" with different configurations.  It's an *open* Linux build with the capability of switching to Windows, which also has access to Steam Big Picture mode but offers greater game compatibility.  Expect other steambox manufacturers to include Windows.  Steamboxes are likely to have controllers that integrate biometric data from the player and eye tracking.  Were the SteamBox set to run Windows, it would have access to the Windows App Marketplace allowing it to run any number of multimedia apps and custom interfaces.  Users would also have access to their entire library of already-purchased Windows games (I could play my 140+ game library for free).  They would have access to the regular Steam sales that Steam would be able to offer due to their digital distribution -- why can steam do this?  Steam is the PC gaming giant with over 50-70% of game sales where game producers get gross margins of 70%, as opposed to the 30% producers get at retail.  They have no agreement with GameStop other than Steam gift cards. Steam is already introducing an (old)X1-cloned Sharing system.  Manufacturer Xi3's Piston Design has been demoed and pitched as a candidate, with the shown Piston model being $1,000.  Models are rumored to be between $500-1000.  I think it will take Steambox a while to get adoption beyond dedicated gamers for a while.  It has the capabilities, but its multimedia will be seen more like an HTPC which is not exactly mainstream yet.  Give it a few more years before it can compete for ""Input one""

Points: Integration with Windows, monstrous game library, access to Apps from Windows 8 Marketplace, strong multimedia capabilities, digital distribution, unique eye/biometric control, manufacturers can include HDMI-in and HTPC features, massive indie presence, can use Playstation and Xbox controls if desired, **mod support**    


- The **Playstation** has been a contemporary competitor to the Microsoft Xbox, fighting on traditional ground such as hardware specs and games.  In the latest generation, Playstation took expected moves to do a traditional console and have an incremental increase in RAM speed/GPU cores.  They are fighting Microsoft 1:1 in games.  ""Our traditional game policies are awesome when compared to Microsoft.""  And all of the sudden every 7-yr old in the world knows how to use the word ""draconian.""  ""Our on-board hardware is slightly better when compared to Microsoft.""  ""Our games are comparable (this is all subjective) when compared to Microsoft.""  ""We will be $100 cheaper than Microsoft.""  All this time Microsoft meticulously and quite obviously constructed a service to compete with digital distribution-embracing multimedia powerhouses on the horizon.  Or do we *honestly* think Microsoft is not seeing Steambox and AppleTV as major gaming and multimedia competitors?  How can you possibly expect to beat Steambox with nearly every game available on consoles, a monstrous zealous fanbase, cross-platform purchases where people already own hundreds of AAA games, an extensive app marketplace and jaw-dropping summer sales with a traditional console?  Microsoft is fighting the battle for Input 1, as they have said for a while. This battle will be against Steambox and AppleTV. The PS4 will get Input 2 or 3 after the TV.  It can't fight Apple's multimedia, and it can't fight Steambox's games.    

Points: $400, trade and sell used physical games, first-party studios/IPs

I think microsoft wasn't concerned about Sony in the long run.  Nearly every move Microsoft has made more matches up to hit Steambox/AppleTV head-on.  Microsoft just needs an early market footprint.  Microsoft did well in the 360 vs PS3 war due to an earlier release.  They want to repeat this early advantage in regards to the AppleTV and Steambox.  The PS4 is a short term battle, stealing the large market share.  Microsoft doesn't really need 60% of the marketshare this year, they want a sizable head-start over their real long-term competitors.  Microsoft is fighting the immediate battle against Sony, but the war will be against AppleTV and Steambox.  The new kids are going to be monsters on release and are used games and a couple hundred dollars enough to beat them?  I genuinely doubt it.  You need the games, apps, TV integration, PC integration, expanded input and points of differentiation such as the cloud.    

Microsoft has a new architecture, unique to any console.  It's being built from the ground-up with cloud in mind.  It has the ability to integrate all your home devices (most don't realize it has an IR blaster).  The Xbox one has strong advantages against each of its two competitors.  Microsoft can compete with advantages and weaknesses against all fronts.  The Xbox one has an all-in-one build - it can do Multimedia without having to get 5 different apps to do the TV, twitch, Netflix and other features.  Microsoft, for being able to compete as a multimedia giant, has an *exceptional* price point.  Like PS4 it has strong studios and IPs. Microsoft saw this future and has been preparing for it for years.  They will be ready.  **Only good things will happen for gamers in a battle between these three giants**    

EDIT: I am by no means saying this is definitely it, so I would love to hear some other peoples' opinions!    
EDIT 2: The conversation sparked by i_am_zorgath and talues is easily one of the most civilized, interesting debates I've seen on a gaming sub in a while.  That thread is actually about the Apple vs Microsoft thing -- not just PS4 vs Xbox one.  Thanks for some good dialogue, people!"	t5_2xbci	True

Sure it enforces a lot of restrictions on used games in particular, but it could end up being one of the best moves Microsoft has ever made. I just cannot stand the fact that half of Reddit hasn't taken the time to actually understand the vision that Microsoft is trying to achieve.

Whether you love it or hate it this is how innovation happens. These types of risks are what set the good from the great. This is a move I would have expected out of Apple, not Microsoft. As a gaming these are extremely exciting times. This move by Microsoft could pan out to shape gaming for generations to come.

This is a title that could easily become an  Xbox One Kinect exclusive.  It's a failed kickstarter project made by former Lionhead developers.  Kinect One is a lot better and this really takes us back to the Project Natal promise.  You remember Ian don't you Microsoft?  Of course you do.

1371724540.0	1gpx6y	Many people seem to think that with the change in policies, the Xbox One is now merely an Xbox 360 2. Here's why I disagree...	jem0208	150	54	248	"Due to the recent [change in policy](http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/update), we've lost family sharing (I know we've lost discless play as well but that's a pretty minor feature). Many people seem to be saying that the lack of this means the Xbox One is no longer innovating, and isn't really next gen. I disagree. Family sharing wasn't the only interesting feature of the Xbox One, it wasn't the only ""next gen"" feature. The Xbox One still has some really great stuff.


For example we still have...

* The possibilities of cloud computing - The change in policy hasn't changed this is any way. Games can and hopefully will still take advantage of this feature.

* Dedicated Servers for every game.

* The new OS - This includes stuff like instant switch, instant playing and auto resume, multitasking with snap, skype, TV, Twitch streaming integration, SmartGlass, new ""Smart Match"" matchmaking, new achievements etc.

* Brand new controller - It has rumble in the triggers. That's so cool.

* Day one digital downloads.

* Kinect - Arguably the most ""next gen"" feature of the console. The Kinect will still be bundled and this will hopefully lead to more developers taking advantage of the Kinect more often and in more interesting ways.

Also, they never said they won't re-add the family sharing features etc. for digital purchases, we still have a few months till launch..."	t5_2xbci	True

2. They hate GameStop [(who made 1.2B on you last year)](http://news.gamestop.com/press-release/business/gamestop-reports-sales-and-earnings-fiscal-2012-and-provides-2013-outlook) but want disk based games that break, scratch, and are overpriced.

3.  Love technology advancements but downplay that XB1 is pushing limitations like cloud computing (not PS cloud storage only), Media inter-connectivity, Twitch, Kinect2, and other new features.  PS4 has some, but nothing near XB1.

4.  Are worried about privacy with the Kinect (which can be turned off) but PS lost info on 77M accounts when [they were hacked](http://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2012/10/25/sony-ps3-hacked-again-all-future-games-decryptable-no-solution-possible/).  Numerous times.

5.  Complain about XBL but now PSN+ is a requirement to game online.  XBL also didn't have month long outages.

6.  I give a little slack on the online requirements but most people have a stable ISP.  I understand some don't, and that sucks.  I think MS needs to figure out a solution to this that works for both sides.  A majority of gamers are online and I would rather advance the industry than remain linear.

Both consoles have pros and cons.  The PS4 region, + games downloads, and other features make it great too.  I just feel /r/gaming and other coverage is insane and not warranted.

* Sniper rifle scope stability tied to pulse and/or movement. Breathe slow and keep still. Suddenly sniping becomes extra tense.  Stealth can also be tied to these.

* An app that shows my heartrate in a separate window while playing games. I can get pretty stressed during multiplayer games, so it cold be a kind of biofeedback therapy for me 

* Heart rate variability (HRV) training. Holy shit, I just looked this up, and surprisingly, Kinect 2 is sensitive enough to track HRV ([article here](http://mobihealthnews.com/22628/xbox-one-kinect-2-0-and-the-future-of-health-technology/)). You probably don't know what that is, but it's a very cool tool to use for health and meditation. I actually have [one of these](http://www.heartmath.com/), but you don't need one if you want to explore HRV -- there are free iPhone (and probably Android) apps that will track your HRV with your phone's camera. 

* Multiplayer games that show you the expression of the person you just killed/killed you. Optional cartoon masks/hats/accessories over faces for privacy 

* Temporarily mute your mic with a gesture. Hold up your finger for a sec so people can't hear you fart, and then go back to your game

* Highlight a teammate by pointing so you can say ""thanks"" or whatev and only that person can hear it.

* Speech dictation for sending text messages through XBL.

* We've already heard that in Dead Rising 3, zombies may notice any noise that you make"	t5_2xbci	True
1370982852.0	1g5apx	Xbox One is positioning itself on much safer ground than the internet is willing to accept.	UltraRascal	285	188	374	"All Sony has done is kick the can down the road.  Their victory yesterday is going to bite them in the ass much worse later on down the road.

The world is going digital.  It doesn't matter whether you like it or not (and downvoting me or anyone that says it isn't going to change it either just so you know) it is going to happen.  At a certain point the profits from digital distribution are going to be large enough that is is financially beneficial to stop sending out physical copies.  We are much closer to that right now than most people even realize or want to accept.

All Sony have done is deflect the gamers rage onto Microsoft for the time being.  It may be as soon as 4-5 years from now and people will be screaming at Sony for the same thing that Microsoft is going through right now.  When you talk digital downloads the idea of trading in used games goes out the window almost certainly.  They stood up there and screamed that their system doesn't require the internet in any way, but in 4-5 years when physical media is phased out there are going to be a whole bunch of pissed off people who can't buy games in a store anymore.  Then--what do you know that can-do-no-wrong PS4 requires the internet afterall!

So I hope they enjoy their day of ""victory"" because in fewer years than people realize this issue is going to come back up again for Sony and they will not be able to deflect it onto Microsoft again."	t5_2xbci	True

1374531043.0	1iucxu	Heads up when pre-ordering from GameStop!!	Mastermrz	131	38	118	"Hi guys

I know GameStop is not accepting preorders but this is for the future if they ever claim they have left.

So I preordered the PS4 first back in early June and gladly reserved my spot. I have a GameStop Powerup card so preordering is quick and simple. As I was preordering, I asked about the Xbox One and if there's any spots left to preorder that too and that's when I just suspected the hate.
She told me that there's like 3 consoles left (which is fair) but she kept reminding me about the DRM and 24hour connectivity. I told her that it doesn't affect me but she ignored it and said it could hurt me in the long run (which I'm very sure it won't)

Now, I'm not planning on taking my Xbox anywhere and I have perfect Internet that barely ever stops or has problems. I also have wifi so it should work perfectly.

About 3 weeks ago, I called my GameStop to see if they are still taking preorders and they said they are still accepting preorders until in the end of the weekend. Now keep in mind this GameStop is not in a mall or anything, its in its own place and rarely has a crowd of people. I come into GameStop 5 MINUTES AFTER THE CALL and they said there's no more. There's no way in just 5 minutes they all just disappeared.
They again reminded me that Xbox might put the DRM back but I told her I just want to preorder. They said that they will give me a heads up notice when it happened. 

Keep in mind I was smooth and had no attitude towards them, I'm usually a very nice guy. I asked them if I could preorder from the Microsoft Store and they said its not worth it because they tried that and Microsoft just canceled their preorder immediately. I said thanks and walked out. I knew the story was complete bullshit so I went home and checked Microsofts Store and... Xbox Ones completely in stock and ready to preorder! I'm very pissed that they lied to me. I preordered my Xbox One with a 1 year subscription to LIVE.

This is just a heads up to anyone wanting to preorder. Just because your local GameStop filled with bullshit liars says no, that doesn't mean it's true.

****EDIT:**** Apparently ever since my story blew up, more people are posting the same experience from their GameStop! Awesome we are exposing them

It was an incredibly useful tool for anyone who likes to watch stuff with people who don't happen to be in the same room as them.  I've been in a long distance relationship for a bit, and whenever we try to watch something together, we load the movie up on netflix, then start a skype video chat, then point laptops at the TV to sync up our streams before actually being able to watch the movie.  And if someone needs to pause or whatever, we have to do the whole syncing process over again.  
  
I feel like with the new and improved Kinect 2.0 as well as the new skype functionality, this is the perfect time to bring back Netflix (and maybe Xbox Video) party mode.  Especially since this generation has a more all encompassing entertainment target, rather than settling at just gaming.
  
C'mon Microsoft.  Gimme back my party mode.  Use that shit as a marketing point.  I can see the commercial now.  Dad watching ""The Sandlot"" with his son who is away at school, and they talk about when they watched it years ago when it came out and how the kid took his signed Jose Canseco bat out to the park with his friends that one time.  Sigh, good times.  
  
You can even make it a feature on Windows 8.  That would expand even farther the number of people who can watch stuff together who may not own a game console.  Swap Dad and kid out for Grandma and Granddaughter watching ""Beauty and the Beast.""  Seriously, that shit sells.

You don't hear much about people switching after Microsoft botched the launch, but personally, I can't wait. I've never tried Kinect before (and will never know what the 1.0 version was like) and the notion of my TV responding to voice and gesture command is like a sci-fi fever dream.

Would love to hear from anyone else jumping the PS3 ship. We're out here, I know it.

1372336739.0	1h6as9	Winning the battle , but at what cost ?	Pafarm	142	58	316	"Sony is  winning . They are taking more pre-orders for PS4 and its games . They have an extreme amount of goodwill and clear momentum . To deny this is foolhardy . At 35 years of age I deal in reality  not never never land. 

But with age comes abit of perspective . The race for the ""must have console"" is only in its opening stage and Sony has made some major sacrifices to get the early lead . Like ,  

1. throwing away the Playstation Eye.
 In a report from IGN http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/26/sony-sacrificed-the-playstation-4-camera-to-beat-microsoft-on-price Sony threw away years of investment and possible future innovation to save a few bucks. 

2. Doubling down on core gamers to make a profit . 

All companies need a significant profit to stay in business . Thats why they exist and without it they won't.  In a compelling article from wired.com  http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2013/05/xbox-one-gaming/ they lay out the real problem that console gaming isn't profitable in the fractured gaming world we live in. So clearly they're trying to take MS players to change that . But what % of gamers would they need to turn the tide? 


3. No blockbuster exclusive titles. 

Playststion has good exclusive games and are in love with inde titles , but they don't have any blockbuster, must have , console selling games. The have nothing that can compete sales wise with , Halo or  Gears of War . Add to that Titanfall which has received universal praise http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/e3-xbox-one-and-xbox-360-games-win-big-at-e3 &amp; Plants vs Zombies : Garden Warfare and the gap looks to be widening. 

MS &amp; Xbox are taking the exact opposite longterm approach .  

1. Kinetc included 

2. Diversifying their target audience and consoles' abilities beyond gaming.

3. Adding to there blockbuster lineup , and partnering with huge players such as the  NFL &amp; Twitch. 
Microsoft has it's challenges , but has left itself a world of possibilities .
 
Taking a step back it looks clear to me that Sony is trying to win now at the expence of the  future. This tactic may work but it is very dangerous at best , and suicidal at worst.  

As a company I'd love to be in the lead like Sony , but in no way shape or form would I want to be pinned in that corner .

EDIT :Thanks for all the comments.

 Many have said in the comments that the PS eye isn't dead . I did provide a link to a legit news piece saying the Eye is dead. They/I could be wrong , but its not just me. 

I did say Sony has great games . 

No one has argued against my assurtion that doubling down on core gamers will not raise enough money to be profitable longterm. If you can, please challenge this thought. As a good debt is healthy .

The PS4 is exactly what they want as it follows the exact thing that is made every time there is a new system. Nothing new, nothing risky about it. The same can't be said about the Xbox. The Xbox is a completely new idea (at least for consoles, not including Steam) and it takes a risk that gamers aren't ready to try. All these ""mistakes"" that the people in /r/gaming are finding are all excuses that they won't want the regular game system to change. I honestly don't see anything wrong with the PS4 except for the fact that there is basically no difference from other game systems, and I am fine that people want to get that. However, all the gamers hear the word ""change"" and immediately think bad. Microsoft is willing to take risks and all the people that are buying this new system are ready for the new future, where Sony and Nintendo will follow. Most gamers aren't ready yet. The other consoles will ease into the ""future"". Microsoft is going full force from the beginning, which has its pros and cons. Us gamers willing to take the risks are the future. We are the changers. We. Are. Onesies.


EDIT: Yes not all change is good. ALL change has pros and cons. Here, at least for me and most people reading this, the pros of sharing and no CDs apply while things like the 24 hour check can be simply solved. The pros outweigh the cons and I don't understand why people don't see this.

I will be completely honest with you, I did not own a 360 because I did not like the idea of needing to pay extra money to access my Netflix, while also being shown ads. That is literally what stopped me from getting a 360 and opting for a PS3. I still used my roommate's 360 from time-to-time, playing games like Trials HD, and Halo 3/Reach. I enjoyed a lot of things about the 360, and have no problem understanding why people love the Xbox ecosystem. 

But this isn't about me.

Microsoft had a great conference today. I skipped out on the last half of a class to watch it, and really enjoyed it. Honestly, I enjoyed it more than Sony's in a lot of ways (though, yes, the last half hour of Sony's conference did truly sway my decision). I look forward to hearing more about Quantum Break, as well as seeing that new Swery game (D4). The XBone looks like it will be a great platform in a lot of ways, and I hope that those of you who decide to make it your platform of choice enjoy it immensely =)

On behalf of the members of both the /r/PS4 and /r/xboxone communities, know that we aren't all trying to be rude. I apologize for those that seem to find pleasure in attacking, or belittling. Enjoy gaming, and let's continue to love this industry that we helped shape and form."	t5_2xbci	True

Then I took a 12 hour breather and came back to it with a level head. What they're doing may be to their benefit money-wise, but we're also getting something in return. The Cloud.

Now before you go saying, ""PS4 has the same thing!"" Know that they have something almost entirely different. Their service is for streaming games to the console, it is not meant for dedicated servers or what is called ""Cloud Computing.""

Unfortunately, people have taken up in arms(rightfully so) and have completely forgotten about the Cloud. This feature will offer the Xbox One something the PS4 will never have unless they invest in it themselves.

Currently, Xbox Live is running on 15,000 servers, Xbox One will launch with 300,000 Azure Servers. This means(as they have already stated for one game) dedicated servers! Cloud computing will also allow for a much more powerful system than people realize.

Think of it like this. With just about every game, I am required to run everything natively. Item spawning, enemy spawning, AI movements, etc. this can be done by the Cloud instead, leaving more processing power for things on the client side(your side). 

I believe that I read today that it will actually boost processing power x10. I personally need to get some more concrete data on the subject, but I could easily see x10 the power as a reality.

What an exciting feature! This essentially will also expand the life-time of the console itself as it gets older and the hardware becomes more obsolete.

People make the point that MS is moving into the future, this is definitely one of the ways they're doing it. I can overlook that week long getaway to the cabin without my console for the shear awesomeness that this could bring(they wouldn't invest in so many servers otherwise; unless you think they're storing your kinect data there). 

P.S. I'm not making a knock at PS fans. They have a great system coming their way. I'll be picking one up probably next summer for their exclusives. But I'm more I'm more intrigued at this point by MS and their new found hardware.

I wasn't able to get DirectTV because I live in an area of town with a lot of trees and an older style house with a crazy roof. Thirdly I enjoy playing EA Sports games and the Call of Duty franchise (among others,I'm not just a bro gamer) which they showed off! Put another check mark in fknthndr's awesome collumn. 

Then comes all of this backlash after the show about the internet connection and used games and borrowed games and I got to think about that. I got to thinking about that and realized that hey I do not give a fuck about having to be online to play, my Xbox stays at my house connected to my internet all the time. If the internet does go like it did yesterday due to the weather I can go out to eat with my girlfriend and catch a movie (I highly recomend the new movie Mud). 

I only buy new games so the used game stuff doesn't bother me. I have essentially very few friends in the town I live in that are gamers to borrow games from that fees or blocking borrowed games still doesn't matter to me. 

Ah, yes the dreaded kinect. My girlfriend goes out of town at least twice a month for work she usually only carries her iPad and iPhone when she goes out of town. I don't have an iPhone so we cant facetime. Lo and behold Microsoft comes up with a solution for that by giving me HD Skype on my TV. So you are telling me that I can watch a movie on TV and have her in the Skype box on the side of the screen so it is like we are watching together just like at home? Sold. 

I am sorry for everyone else but Microsoft built this box specifically for me. However I do understand that other people have very necessary concerns about this stuff and am not trying to make light of the plight of my fellow gamers and their situations. If my conditions were different then I would be voicing my anger as well but at this stage in my life I really just dont give a damn. I play games to take off some steam and keep connected with my friends back home. The Xbox One will do all of that and more. 

**tl:dr: Blame me for the Xbox One as I am the target demographic with disposable income, Xfinity TV service, who loves the NFL, enjoys playing Madden and Call of Duty, has a generally very reliable constant internet connection, and who is getting too old to give a damn.**

I live in Kansas we had a huge storm today. The 80mph winds broke trees in half, blocking the streets and with the rain we couldn't see 20ft in front of us causing car crashes. Street lights didn't work and quite a few places had no power.

The storm was pretty bad and lasted about 45 minutes. at 10pm I completely lost the internet in my home. If Microsoft had kept the original policy guess what would have happened? Absolutely nothing, my internet was back in an hour.

A few weeks ago we had a full on tornado that touched down and caused a bit of havoc and my internet didn't even go out then.

We all knew that both the PlayStation four and Xbox one were going to play video games. I don't think were breaking any new ground by saying. So if we absolutely know it's going to play games, and most of them the same from one console to the next, why spend an exorbitant amount of time talking about games. Especially when E3 is just around the corner.

I can really appreciate that they sat up on that stage and talk to the console itself. I really like to know what my console can do in addition to playing video games. Some people seem to forget that they were revealing a console and not a games lineup today. If Microsoft's goal was to inform me of exactly what the Xbox one was capable of doing then absolutely succeeded in any way measure.

I guess that's mostly just my opinion, but really they did exactly what they set out to do I would imagine.

1372464657.0	1ha6zc	Kinect could be the thing that puts the Xbox One over the top as a multimedia device.	Izick	120	48	48	"To me I think it's going to be worth it in the long run for Kinect, but I'm not sure if it's because of the gaming possibilities. They could be very interesting potentially, but the real potential of the Kinect lies in the machine being a multimedia box. Let me explain.

So these boxes are going to be multimedia boxes, right? They need to be in this day and age. Microsoft's box especially needs to fit this role. So the future of multimedia boxes isn't as sexy (yet) as say video games. Video game consoles get these big graphical bumps every half-decade or so, and there are immediate results. What of Apple TV? Yeah, it's a little quieter, cooler, faster, smaller, etc., but nothing substantial from a hardware perspective. Software is updated and made better.

The key here is the Kinect. Yes, the Kinect. You know what the future of multimedia is? UI navigation. We can only have videos at X amount of resolution, and we can have the fastest boxes, but who cares how fast the horse is if the reigns take several seconds to snap?

The Kinect is Microsoft's answer to the [Apple Rings](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/9970126/Apple-to-launch-TV-with-ring-remote-control-says-analyst.html). We laugh, ""Who needs to replace a remote? How lazy!"" but that's not how innovators in this field think. Who needed a phone that could send text messages? Who needed a phone that could do more than talk and text?

Besides losing a remote, you know what the problem is with TV UI? It shows you everything you don't want to see, 99% of the time. If I want to watch The Walking Dead, I have to know what channel it's on and what time. If I look for it digitally, I have to sift through menus or use the archaic text-search. Text search is great on keyboard driven devices like PC's or phones. They're horrendous to use on remote controls or controllers.

So, where does that leave us? Well, the Kinect could solve all of this. You know what the real problem was with Kinect on the 360? There are 77 million Xbox 360's out there, and only 24 million Kinects. You can't develop a strong UI when you know nearly 2/3rds of your consumers can't use it. Lack of homogeneity kills product innovation. When you have no standard, you give a ton of less incentive for people to develop for something, and your teams working on the UI (user-interface) and UX (user-experience) are too busy creating several different experiences that all come up short in the end.

Now, pair all of this with the idea of multi-tasking. Another one of the ""wow, how lazy! You can't wait two minutes to switch!"" people love to throw around. This, again, stifles product innovation. When you have the potential of Kinect's voice commands, which remove potentially dozens of hurdles between the UI and the user, you are left with a really slick UI and UX. Now, this is why we've seen so much about this 3GB, 3 in one, Trinity OS. This is all about speed, speed, speed and multi-tasking. It's bringing the smart-phone's innovations and excellent steps in this area home to the multimedia box.

So where does this all leave us? Well now it's time for the experience. This is the last mile, so to speak. The mile where companies like Apple always seem to experience. Microsoft has all the right tech and ideas in place. A remote-less new and exciting way to navigate and find content that's powered by a seriously powerful OS. Still, what is all this innovation if they don't have the experience to back it up? They need to put on their Apple hats and really polish the hell out of everything. They need to make the UX the best they possibly can on day one. Obviously things will get better from there, but they really need to let people know that there are major reasons why they should pick this up over an Apple TV. It's now or never.

So yeah, this stuff fascinates me! For me I'm really excited for the games, but the ideas of innovating in the UI/UX is something that I think is going to be a shot in the arm to the home-multimedia box market. You'll see the Xbox One and the new Apple TV (not sure if they'll still use rings) and it'll be an all out war.

1373772536.0	1i98md	I've decided to get an Xbox One	unimpresseddriver	126	57	186	"I am a huge Sony fan.  I bought every multiplatform game on the PS3 and only got 360 exclusives and only for the first 3 years of the generation before I quit buying games for it.  That said, it seems that every non-exclusive title is also being released for PC and my PC is far more powerful than either console (save for when they start making PS4 games that require 6GB of GDDR5 RAM on the video card), so console power is not my concern.

I have been looking to get a better camera for Skype video calls and since good webcams easily run upwards of $150, the Kinect camera has been far more enticing.  Add to that the fact that the Xbox One has more, and more appealing, launch titles and the decision became fairly obvious.  I am incredibly interested in the idea of streaming PS4 games to the Vita, but I just wont believe it until I see it in action.  I've seen many attempts at streaming games in the past, and I just don't think I could get over the inevitable latency that will likely result.

Now when they do start making games for the PS4 that take full advantage of the RAM on the console, I will probably pick one up, but I have a feeling that it will be 1-3 years before that happens and even then, who knows what interesting things will be coming out for the Xbox.

&gt; **EDITORIAL**

*Why it’s important:* This is the first console release of a game that doesn’t follow Desmond. It also follows on the heels of the polarizing third entry. Regardless, it’s going to sell millions of copies.

*Best Case Scenario:* A return of one of the more recognizable franchises as more than just a yearly installment. Edward is likable and interesting, along with whoever is in the Animus this time. Tight and responsive controls in combat and more sensible meta-games.

*Worst Case Scenario:* Uninspired gameplay, weak characters, and nonsense story.

In the United States alone, nearly two-thirds of the country is **hindered** by internet service providers who place data caps and bandwidth caps on internet usage:

* Comcast: 300 GB/month
* AT&amp;T: 150 or 250 GB/month (depending on plan)
* Cox: 30-400 GB/month (tiered system)
* Charter: 100-500 GB/month (tiered)

* MediaCom: 150-999 GB/month (tiered)
* Cable One: 1 or 50 or 100 GB/month (depending on plan)

Major ISPs without caps: Time Warner, Verizon, Cablevision, Frontier, Windstream, Fairpoint, and Cincinnati Bell.

And it's not better around the rest of the world: http://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/how_bad_do_we_really_have_it_bandwidth_caps_around_world

So what are you going to do when you're nearing a cap? If you had to wait a few days for the next month, are you going to play online or watch Netflix? Hold on, you have that research paper to do. I guess Halo 5 or Killzone multiplayer is going to have to wait!

Even if these restrictions don't affect you, don't ignore the fact that other people have to deal with it. What's the point of playing online if your friend or someone else in the next state over can't get on?

1371467516.0	1gicfp	What I think is the greatest innovation of the Xbox One over its predecessor.	djkmart	99	33	49	"We could talk forever about graphical capability, 3rd party support, exclusive titles, online fees blah blah blah. All I know is, this scenario happens to me a lot...

I get home from work roughly half an hour before my girlfriend (most days - some days I work from home and I can game whenever I want). The 360 is in our living room because we use it for EVERYTHING. My girlfriend is not a gamer, and she watches one show every day after work, through the xbox. It's not a major request, so I ususally don't mind losing the game time. We usually end up chilling on the couch watching Netflix after that. This gives me about 25 minutes of potential, precious game time every evening before the living room gets taken over. I turn the xbox on, put the game in...great... there's an update. Okay, it's just another 5 minutes. I still have 20 minutes of game time. 

Finally get the game on. I'm playing Fable III. The thing about Fable III is that it auto-saves after each mission, and as far as I'm aware, there's no ability to manually save. Some of these missions are a tad long. Girlfriend comes home  and I'm only half way through the mission. I now either turn off the game and lose all of my progress or I don't let her watch her show. Either way is a pain in the ass for me. 

Later on, we'll be watching Netflix, and I don't know about you guys, but I think the listing system sucks. We can never 'just find a movie' that we want to watch with trawling through endless lists of titles. The search menu is crap too. Try typing in Christian Bale with your xbox remote, only to find that you've seen all of the movies they have. It's really annoying and before you know it, you've wasted an hour of movie time.

Now, I know these are all first world problems, but we're talking about technological advancement here, and I don't think many people have considered how much of an impact instantaneous gaming / tv / movies will be. I would get home, say 'Xbox On', game boots up right away from wherever I last paused it, and I get a full 30 minutes of play. Any updates are already loaded and ready to go, so no game time lost there. Then I say 'Xbox TV' and my girlfriend gets her TV show. Then we say something along the lines of 'Search Christian Bale' (or something), and we get all his movies instantly, without having to type anything on that infernal remote! 

I've just cut out so much dead time it's unbelievable. Taking into consideration what this means, turn on your 360 right now, and time how long it takes you to start controlling whatever character you're playing as in your game. I bet it's something like 5 minutes. When you're sat looking at your watch, it can feel like forever. 

This is going to be a solution to one of those problems that we never even knew we had, and just like a lot of the great new advancements in technology (facebook for community, twitter for culture, skype for communication etc) it's going to making our gaming lives a hell of a lot more convenient.

From what ive seen and researched, this is going to be a huge boost in my love for gaming. Twitch Tv, group Skype snapped to your game, watching tv while queing for a matchmade game; these all sound like wonderfull features that i never knew i needed. 

That last part is key. The thing i loved about the Xbox 360 was the innovation of features i never knew i needed. First my standard for multiplayer was LAN parties at most. Then they added Xbox Live which made the whole process 100% more convenient. Then they added parties and cross-game chat, which brought the feel of a lan party and communication to a press of a button. 

I feel like what microsoft is doing is just what they've done before: innovate. One of the biggest things for me is the cloud storage of all games. This is something that i could not be more excited for. Furthermore, the prospect of the freedom to give up to 10 people access to my games is something that is mindblowing, and i think microsoft should focus and capitalize on more with the press. Of course innovation comes at a cost. With microsoft dipping their metaphorical lower half into the on demand games market pool, there of course has to be restrictions so as to keep you from buying a game and single handedly giving it to all of your friends for free.

For instance, lets say you buy Halo 5. You install it and it gets uploaded to the cloud, as well as your Hard Drive. You then unplug your internet, go to gamestop and sell the game, and now, viola, a near free game. This method could be done for giving your games to friends in an endless sharing loop. It's just business sense that these restrictions be imposed. 

I feel that Sony is capitalizing on what they heard the internet Circle-Jerking about, and grabbing the limelight for sales. To me, the PS4 seems like a PS3 with required subscription for multiplayer and upgraded hardware. Not much is new and I think people that buy both consoles will end up missing the innovative features that the Xbox One has when playing their PS4."	t5_2xbci	True

I mean come on... with all the privacy and such that you give up, even if you don't believe that you are, such as with cell phone contracts or just with using some sort of social networking (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc) this is just a drop in the bucket. Hell, if you have cookies enabled in your browser (and even if you don't) you're probably being monitored more thoroughly than the Xbox One could even dream of, and that only with Microsoft, don't even get me started on Google.

1375511616.0	1jm5l1	Let's make a list of every unique feature the X1 has.	PredatoreeX	91	30	127	"Please comment with more and I'll edit them into the post.

___


**Kinect:**

-Facial recognition to sign into profile, change to your custom settings, etc. Also eliminates the need to swap controllers, as it can recognize who is where and is using which controller.

-Voice commands (Xbox, on. Xbox, Snap Pizza Hut app. Xbox, order large Hawaiian pizza)

-1080p camera, good for video chat on Skype

-Uses advanced noise cancellation, so it can adjust to hear only the person holding the controller ([Read this](http://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/1iu8mr/audio_processing_improvements_to_the_new_kinect/))

-Can recognize your mood, whether or not you're talking and whether you're looking at the TV or not.

-Because every controller has an IR LED, Kinect can track the controller similarly to Sixaxis on the PS3. Can be used for subtle but useful things, such as shoving a zombie off a car in Dead Rising 3 by pushing your controller forward.

-Can now track rotation (orientation of body parts), force (e.g. punching for boxing games) pressure put on each body part, heartbeat, infrared (enables it to see you in the dark), etc.

-Can track up to 6 people, unlike Kinect 1 which could track 2.

-Can be used from around 3-4ft away, as opposed to the Kinect 1 which required around 6-8ft. Ideal for small rooms/apartments.

-[Check out this awesome video by Wired.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi5kMNfgDS4)

-***Can be turned off.***

___

**Other:**

-Instant switching between games, dashboard, and apps.

-Cloud processing can take some of the pressure off of the GPU. Latency may still be an issue.

-300,000 Xbox Live servers, compared to the current 15,000. Also, Microsoft is giving devs access to these servers for no cost. Dedicated servers are not mandatory, but since there's no reason not to use them... [Peter Rubin expects all your games such as CoD, Titanfall, Destiny, and Battlefield to use dedicated servers.](http://videogamesandnews.com/xbox-one-multiplayer-features-dedicated-servers-smart-match-trd/)

-Every console is a dev kit.

-Virtually [unlimited](http://www.neowin.net/news/xbox-one-to-have-unlimited-cloud-storage) storage in the cloud for digital games, game saves, profiles, etc.

-No HDCP protection in the Blu-Ray drive. This means you can plug in a capture card device to record gameplay. Unclear about how it will play Blu-Ray movies without HDCP, however.

-New reputation system that lets you avoid people you don't want to play with. Article [here](http://news.xbox.com/2013/07/games-reputation-feature).

-HDMI in port- you can plug in almost anything that has an HDMI port. Xbox 360. PlayStation, cable box, etc, and then control that through the One (voice commands also work for this).

-Snap mode! Snap any app to the side no matter what you're doing. Want to Skype a friend to watch some Netflix together? Say ""Xbox, snap Skype. Xbox, call ""X"""". Want to order pizza while watching Game of Thrones? Snap the Pizza Hut app to the side and order some pizza without pausing.

-All party chat uses Skype for better sounding audio.

-Matchmaking is done in the background. You can do other things while waiting for the Xbox to match you with players in Halo.

-Low power state in the controller. When you're watching a Netflix movie for example, the controller will become inactive, saving battery life.

-Has a unique TV guide for when you plug your cable box in the HDMI in. You can take full control of it using your voice. Want to know what's on Comedy Central? ""Xbox, what's on Comedy Central?""

-Fantasy sports integration. Keep track of how your dream team is doing and get notifications as they're playing.

-Uses Twitch TV to stream gameplay.

-Use the Smartglass app from your Android, Windows or iOS device to control your Xbox One remotely.

-Uses Wi-Fi direct to connect to Smartglass-enabled devices. Wi-Fi Direct can reach bandwidth speeds of up to 250Mbps, compared to 12Mbps for Bluetooth 4.0. This means your phone, tablet, wireless headset, etc. will be able to send around 20 times more data than Bluetooth 4.0. A great Wi-Fi Direct vs Bluetooth 4.0 article by PCWorld [here.

1374579806.0	1ivn3m	[Minnesota] I witnessed a Gamestop employee lying to a mom and her son about Xbox One having DRM. Employee got called out by pre-teen kid standing by me.	UltraRascal	100	39	95	"So last night I went into Gamestop to pick up a Nintendo 3DS game.  As I am standing there this kid who looks to be around 16 walks into the store.  He comes over to where I am at and we are both shuffling through the 3DS games.  

A few minutes later a mom and presumably her son who appears to be 10-ish come into the store and go up to the counter.  The mom politely says she would like to preorder the Xbox One if they have any left.  The Gamestop employee says, and I quote ""*We have almost all of ours left.  Most people don't come in and buy the Xbox One since you are required to be connected to the internet 24 hours a day and you can't trade in used games.*""  The employee then goes on about how the system is useless if you disconnect it from the internet for....more than an HOUR.

The mom looks are her son and asks him if he still wants the system.  The kid is clearly thrown off and starting to second guess himself.  The mom tell the kid ""*It is your money so you can do whatever you want with it.*""  When I realized that this little kid probably worked his ass off, saved up his money and was now being lied to by Gamestop I turned towards the counter because I was going to politely tell the woman that she was being lied to.

Before I could even turn this 16 year old kid basically yells to this lady ""Hey lady, that isn't true at all.  He is lieing to you. The Xbox One doesn't require and internet connection and you can trade in any used game you want.""  The employee insists he has never heard this before.  The 16 year old kid then starts rattling off all the facts from June 19th like he has been training for this day for weeks.

Mom turns towards the employee and asks if that is true.  We could all see on the face of the guy that he knew it was true, but he said ""I have never heard of any of that.""  The lady decides that she needs to look into this a bit more and tells the person behind the counter she will come back another day.

I was always skeptical about all of these Gamestop stories people were posting until last night.  At least in Minnesota--Gamestop employees are blatantly lying to people to put them towards buying a PS4."	t5_2xbci	True

1373096448.0	1hqn84	State of the Sub-reddit. Topic about Trolls, Circlejerk, and Misinformation.	Lavadm	114	51	154	"Lets be honest. Most of the people subbed here are interested about the Xbox One and are excited for it. But a large part of the people who partake in the comment section are not. Recently there have been many posts with misleading titles. The most recent one is ""[Microsoft: Xbox One advertising will integrate with Kinect](http://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/1hpjn5/microsoft_xbox_one_advertising_will_integrate/)""

While the article is neat, no where does it state that the Ad's will be mandatory or even happen. It states that Microsoft filed a patent for advertisers to use the kinect sensor to interact with their ads. This is a patent. Many patents are filed in the business world because if they ever do want to use it they can. Many people in the comment sections didn't even read the article or even contributed to anything the article said. Many were complaining about some kind of popping out giant Ad's that affect them in some sort of way. Does this really contribute to the interactivity of ads? No, it doesn't. What it does is fuel the comment section towards the hate of the Product the sub-reddit is all about.

This leads to the trolls part. Many trolls have been coming into this sub-reddit just to attack the Xbox One in any way shape or form or try and start arguments that this Sub-reddit is a circlejerk. Well look at what sub-reddit you are in. You are in the Xbox One sub-reddit and you **WILL** have pro comments for the product. Many are bait and fish and those usually get down voted but recently iv been seeing many many troll comments being up voted with mis-information. This leads to people who don't know about exactly what the Xbox can and cannot offer to be misinformed, not that the troll is being awarded karma.

I see many of these trolls talk down about the ""Cloud"". Many of them say it's a marketing gimmick and sure maybe the word is, but the cloud is real. Any tech intensive person who has been in the industry can say it is very real. This isn't just cloud storage Microsoft is talking about. It's actual processes being offloaded and making matchmaking and AI better in the long term. But i digress. The people in thus sub-reddit praise it like the PS4 sub-reddit praises it's great hardware. And what is wrong with that? What is wrong with the sub-reddit liking the features and things the product will do?

There has to be something done with this. **My only solution would be for mods to delete straight troll posts and hide karma for up to 24 hours for each post. Maybe a rule with the PS4 (Frankly all consoles but we don't have a problem with Wii U and PC users coming in here) cannot be mentioned outside an information post such as, ""Both the Xbox One and PS4 can play games"" (Silly example I know).** This way people have the chance to discuss things without caring about karma. I would personally like for karma to be hidden until the Xbox One is available because really all we are talking about in this sub-reddit is speculation until we actually see the hardware.

Please also give idea's and whatever feedback you can. If you agree or disagree with whatever i am trying to say.

**Edit #1:** I am not saying that there isn't the extreme side of us either. There are some people who take things a bit too far as well. We know the cloud tech Microsoft is bringing is good and very new. Now this doesn't mean that it will be a giant improvement over graphics but we will see some very cool stuff with it. I know there are some bad apples who do like the Xbox One and do defend it a tad bit more then usual but you have to understand everywhere an Xbox One enthusiasts goes on the internet they get ridiculed and bashed. Most of the time it is just misinformation like the xbox one blowing up when you don't connect it every 24 hours (lol), but sometimes people REALLY try to make someone feel bad.

I would like to point out after E3 I received death threats and many comments stating i was a Microsoft employee just because i liked the thing. I still like it and look forward to it each and every day. I check this sub-reddit for more information about it but every time i look at the comments to see what people have to say it is always filled with people fighting, people trolling, and people generally being rude. Sure some people are mis-informed about some aspects but instead of being an ass, tell them in an informed matter. Don't try and one-up them by using sarcastic remarks.

1372614910.0	1hdhv9	Is anyone making the jump to XB1 way ahead of the friends they game with now?	b4k4-san	81	19	110	"I have a core group of 4-5 people I play with on 360 now (sometimes all together in multiplayer, sometimes just hanging out in party chat while we all do our own things), and it looks like the point at which each of us pick up the XB1 is going to be pretty staggered, with some of us wanting to pick it up during the holidays and others wanting to wait until about a year from now.  With some games being released on both systems, there's some disagreement on whether we want to pick them up on the 360 as they come out or wait until we've made the jump.

1371394773.0	1ggfng	How Kinect can save horror gaming	usaf2222	89	29	27	"Horror games have become an increasingly bland genre as of late, relying on jump scares, creature design, and other non psychological aspects of the game. However, *Amnesia: The Dark Descent* showed us that good old fashion horror games that rely on your own mind to work against you are possible in this era of gaming.

That is where Kinect comes in, Kinect to me is the best shot at bringing horror back. Imagine games tailoring their environment based on your expressions and information received from you. This would be incredible because horror games could become true horror games, tailoring their environment and atmosphere to wear your mind down. Going a bit beyond that, the game can remember what moments make you the most tense/scared and is more likely to bring hose up into the future. No more sanity meters needed, your own sanity is what will drive the show.

Think of it like this, you're playing a new horror game at home on your couch. Kinect is constantly taking inputs from you, analyzing your face and your heartbeat as well as the joints on your fingers. You come across a long, dark hallway, that contains many, many rooms. Each one of those room could hide the monster you know is following you. Your heart rate races as you slowly walk down the dimly lit hallway. Seeing this through Kinect, the game triggers an in-game hallucination that shows the hallway's darkness coming like a black torrent of water to pull you away. You scream, close your eyes and shirk back. Kinect will then, having seen your eyes break contact with the screen return the scene to the normal dark hallway. You shake it off and press on, but your scream triggers a door creaking open, a hungry snarl reaching your ears from behind you...

This I think would be one of the most fantastic uses of Kinect, to create truly unique horror games that would rely on what you are doing. In essence every game could truly be different as the game tries out various things to make your own mind work against you."	t5_2xbci	True
1370451965.0	1fqcm7	A Feature I Would Like to See in the New Kinect	ClassicWinger	74	11	17	"

Hey everyone! I had originally posted this in /r/xbox360 but realized it was more appropriate here! This is my first time posting to this sub, so if this has been touched on in the past I apologize!

Redeemable codes can be found in almost every new 360 game. Be it for a special level, a skin pack, or even an Xbox Gold trial, they are everywhere. I often forget to redeem them simply because Im so excited to play the game and I skip the slow process of typing them in. I think it would be very neat and useful if Kinect could redeem them for me. All you would have to do is say to Kinect ""Xbox, redeem code"" and hold the piece of paper with the code up to the camera. It would probably have to be closer to the device itself but it saves so much time typing the number in. iTunes already does this with their cards and its remarkable easy. Features like this one that are simple but rewarding should be focused on with the new kinect. So? What do you all think?

Your not going to win them or the public by doing this and going backwards. You have to continue moving forward into the future.

**Developer:** Ubisoft Massive

**Publisher:** Ubisoft

**NA Release Date:** Q4 2014

**Kinect:** No

**Smartglass:** Yes

**Exclusive:** No

**Genre:** 3rd person shooter, survival, post-apocalyptic, elements of MMO

---

&gt; **EDITORIAL**

*Why it’s important:* This was Ubisoft’s surprise gift for us all. Showing an open-world where players can fight against NPCs and PCs alike, with different zones being PvE or PvP. Very slick presentation means that almost everyone is pumped for this game.

*Best Case Scenario:* The game takes some of the best parts of shooters, MMOs, single player and multiplayer games and mashes them into a superior product. Content updates keep the map of New York fresh and alive.

*Worst Case Scenario:* We have to wait for it. Also, expectations are off the charts which will inevitably mean someone will be disappointed.

 Also having some sort of group circles where people can discuss games/strategies or if you just feel like chatting with strangers for fun. I heard the new chat will support up to 32 people so big discussions would be cool and of course have features where people could vote to kick if someone starts being an asswhole or not contributing to the subject.

1371840785.0	1gt7c7	Should Xbox ONE digital downloads get free DLC as an incentive to buying digital over discs?	Meekman	99	37	75	"Since Digital Download titles will cost the same as Retail titles (Publishers have to appease Retail outlets)... would it be a good idea to include free DLC for digital purchases?  Not just an extra hat or something, but real DLC: extra maps, levels, characters, etc.

DLC was created to counterbalance the losses in Used/Rental games that occur on disc, so it would be nice if free DLC were included for digital purchases since those are neither Used or Rental.

This way, Digital and Retail prices would still be the same, but you just get the DLC bonus for buying digital at the expense of not having a physical disc.  Since Microsoft wants us to buy digital, this would be a nice incentive for the consumer.

Or would that be way too much loss revenue so that Publishers would refuse to do it?  I just think more people would buy digital with that added free content.

EDIT: Just so everyone knows, I don't mean large DLC packs that are almost full games themselves (like ""The Tyranny of King Washington,"" which is a separate storyline for Assassin's Creed III).  Obviously, this would be on a game by game basis.  It would be similar to Amazon, Target, Best Buy exclusives, but a bit better than those."	t5_2xbci	True

1370969464.0	1g4q8o	Explaining Xbox One's content distribution/discs (Warning: statements that support MS inside)	Nate108	94	35	93	"People need to stop thinking of the Xbox One as having disc based games.

Remember a couple of years ago when details leaked the Sony and MS were thinking of going purely digital for the game distribution? Well that didn't go over so well with everyone. If it was true, Sony backed off and went with a traditional disc based distribution.

Microsoft didn't want to give up on digital and they caught themselves between digital and physical. They want to go full digital, which is why every game installs to your XBO and you can play without the discs, but one of the big complaints a couple of years ago was from people with poor internet and data caps. There's no way they'd be able to download an entire 20gb game off of Live. So they included physical discs into their plan. Unable to download a game? Buy the content disc that installs it to your XBO and transfers the license. The problem is now you need to check that the game is legally installed onto the system. They couldn't go always online, so they implemented the 24 hour check-in, expecting it to be a welcome compromise. Nope. Reddit is a fickle bitch.

So now they are caught into a bastard child between digital and physical content distribution. Sony may have had a similar system, but after seeing all of the backlash decided to go purely physical. If I was Microsoft, I would change it so a game license can only be transferred when you are connected to Live. The first time you put the disc in to install it to your XBO, you need to be connected and it registers the license to your Live profile. Want to send the game to a friend? Need to be connected. Basically do not allow the game to install unless you are connected to Live so it can check the license availability.

TL;DR: Microsoft wanted to move to a Steam-like distribution process, but couldn't because some people can't download entire games off of their internet. Tried to come up with a compromise; instantly hated."	t5_2xbci	True

1376013090.0	1jzyo6	My Thoughts On Xbox One Controller Batteries	ShinyMasonite	88	34	98	"Reading all the articles and posts today in the wake of Major Nelson's Xbox One unblocking video, I was baffled to see that people were complaining about the news that the one controller would use batteries in the exact same manor that the 360 does instead of having a built in, un-replaceable battery like the ps3 controller does.

as a proud owner of both a Playstation 3 and an Xbox 360, this is what I've observed across my last six years of current gen gaming. (Please forgive typos, autocorrect is a birch) When I got my 360 I purchased with it a charging stand and two rechargeable batteries for my controller. When the battery I'm using runs low, I simply walk three steps to my charger and replace the battery I'm using with the one I have on the charger. I cycle them like that. It takes maybe fifteen seconds and I'm right back to gaming.

When I play my ps3 for a long time and my battery starts to run low, I walk over to my battery charging stand and-- wait, where's my-- or right, there isn't a standalone battery. I instead tether five or six usb cables together from my ps3 USB port to the end of my controller so I can continue to play while it charges. It's also worth noting that this function only works when the Ps3 is turned on

Five years down the line, the battery cell for my ps3 controller finally ran out meaning it wouldn't turn on and it wouldn't recieve a new charge. You know what the solution was? I went to amazon and paid $50 to buy a new controller.

A year after that, one of my 360 batteries suffered the same fate. Only when that happened, I only had to pay 20 bucks to get TWO replacement batteries.

One of the features that fans of Samsungs Galaxy phone lineup laudes over the iPhone is that the battery can be replaced by the owner whereas the iPhone battery can only be replaced by paying apple to do it for you. But for some reason, when it comes to the Xbox one, its just new ammunition to use in the constantly bullshit battle of the Console Wars. Sure, I'm paying a little extra money upfront to get my batteries and charger for xbox but six years later it cost me less than replacing my ps3 controller.

Also, I've only owned one 360 controller since summer 2008 and I have used it extensively and it still works just fine.

Surely I'm not the only person out there who sees the logic and benefits of replaceable batteries.

*UPDATE*

As pointed out by Nanowerx, you could spend even less money by buying rechargeable AA's that aren't limited to just Xbox controllers.

1374718300.0	1j00qx	[Technical Long Read] How Hyper V coupled with XB1 Game and Windows OS actually works	Craer	67	12	53	"I've been reading a lot of posts on here about the Game OS and Windows OS on the XB1 with regards to RAM and CPU allocation.  This especially came to be true today with CBOAT post about Indie games being locked to the Windows OS and would only be allowed 3GB of ram.  His, as well as most of the posts on here, have no idea how this technology actually works.  I'm going to try and explain it to the best of my ability, here we go.....  

Let’s start with what Microsoft has actually said about XB1:   [Source!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLBVHZokt1Q) There is a ton of good info on this panel about the architecture of the XB1, I pick something up every time I watch portions of it that I did not see before.  
  
- 8GB Ram DDR3  
- 3 OS's (XBox Operating System, Version of Windows, Hyper V)  
- Hyper-V requirement:  512mb + 32MB for each Virtual Machine.  
- Windows OS VM:  3GB ram allocated  
- XB OS VM:  5GB ram allocated  
  
###HyperV:  
This is a completely stripped down version of what we see today, so the overhead could, and probably is less than what it is today (512mb overhead).  They are able to strip this down, because they know exactly what 2 Virtual Machines will be running on the system.  They don't have to worry about  different OS's or any type of flexibility for the end user, every XB1 is the same.  They know exactly how the 2 Virtual Machines on the XB1 will be configured and used.  
  
###XB1 OS:  
This is the gaming OS.  1 game at a time can run here.  Games get installed to the hard drive and then run from there on this OS.  This has a set reservation of resources that is always available if it is needed.  
  
###Windows 8 OS:  
This OS boots right when the box is turned on, and is always on  This is where your apps like Skype, Twitch, GameDVR will run and will be always available.  Based off of the Build conference, this is also where end user published apps will run as well and possibly Indie games based off of the rumors going around today.  
  
So what does this all mean?  Why does HyperV really matter?  Well HyperV and virtualization will play a huge role in where resources are assigned.  There are many ways that HyperV can assign resources to each VM and guarantee that it will have resources available to it when it is needed.  Two of these being Dynamic Memory and Nested Page Tables (both available in Windows Server 2012 HypeV).  
  
###Dynamic Memory:  
  
Here are 3 videos explaining memory optimization in virtual machines as well as how Dynamic Memory and Nested Page Tables work.  [Video 1] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-xX7WCnJlU) [Video 2] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfZrqYD0XMg) [Video 3] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGL_-XwoxVk)  
  
This allows HyperV to allocate and de-allocate memory from a guest VM based on usage while the Virtual Machine is running.  So what does this mean for the XB1?  Well, it means that the Gaming and Windows 8 virtual machines on XB1 can have a set startup memory, say 3GB for the Windows 8 VM and 5GB for the Game OS on boot.  But then based on need each Virtual Machine could grow or shrink its Memory  
  
So, when Microsoft says that there is 5GB available to the game OS and 3GB available to the Windows 8 OS that doesn’t necessarily mean that’s all it can have.  Based on need and what applications/games are running elsewhere can dictate how much memory each VM has.  
  
Is this exactly how Microsoft has designed the XB1?  Probably, but hey, I’m not a dev working on XB1, so I can’t say for sure.  All I know is there is a lot of benefits for them to choose to have their environment based on Hyper-V and 2 separate OS’s that gives them a lot of flexibility that just can’t happen if they did not choose a virtual platform.  I could write and talk about virtualization a lot more, but my guess is you guys are already pretty bored.  Hope ya guys learned something and got something out of this.

1374064029.0	1ihcg1	Countdown to Launch | July 17 | Watch Dogs	whatdoyouwantmetosay	68	11	28	"**Title:** Watch Dogs

**Developer:** Ubisoft Montreal

**Publisher:** Ubisoft

**Director:** Jonathan Morin

**Writer:** Kevin Shortt

**NA Release Date:** November 19 (Xbox 360, PS3, Wii U), [November 19, unless Release Day is a later date] (Xbox One, PS4)

**Kinect:** No

**Smartglass:** Yes

**Exclusive:** No

**Genre:** 3rd person action, near-future stealth

---

&gt; **EDITORIAL**

*Why it’s important:* It’s a present-day stealth game that isn’t Splinter Cell. A lot of marketing by Ubisoft says they expect this to do just as well as Assassin’s Creed, and there seems to be some stylistic overlap between the two titles.

*Best Case Scenario:* Watch Dogs takes the Assassin’s Creed open-world formula and infuses enough tech to transform it into an all-new kind of game. The storyline makes more sense than the typical Assassin’s Creed fare.

*Worst Case Scenario:* Some really cool ideas that don’t seem to be fully developed keep the game from reaching the higher echelons of gaming lore.

&gt; **EDITORIAL**

*Why it’s important:* After the undeniable success of Battlefield 3, EA will release another numbered Battlefield title two years later. Often seen as the older and more mature brother of Call of Duty, the game promotes teamwork and large-scale battles. Like it’s brother, though, single player is largely forgettable.

*Best Case Scenario:* Gameplay improvements like Commander Mode and larger console player count put teamwork at a premium, elevating the quality of online play. Thoughtful DLC keeps the game active. Single player is memorable.

*Worst Case Scenario:* Online is taken over by team-killing airheads (though friendly fire is turned OFF by default), and the only people who use microphones are those disparaging our close relatives. Single player is a 3 hour affair.

I was incredibly excited for next gen gaming, and I watched both reveals, both e3 press conferences (multiple times), and any other online resources I could get my paws on. I am a huge 360 fan, and I think xbox live blows ps+ out of the water (I have both). Yet I came away from all the online information feeling let down by Microsoft.

In my mind, I saw xbox going down the path that Nintendo did during the current cycle, focusing heavily on motion control, family features, and other non-gaming gimmicks, while providing inferior hardware.

I immediately went out and preordered a ps4, partially because it was shiny, but also because I was irritated with xbox for the same reasons you see everywhere: DRM policies, ""forced"" use of kinect, reportedly inferior power under the hood, etc.

Then, when DRM policies were reversed, I was kind of sad. Though the xbone ""wasn't for me"", I was sad that ingenuity was stifled and market diversity was lessened.

Perhaps I merely made a decision too fast, because I started hearing about all kinds of really cool xbone features that did matter to me that either weren't mentioned up to that point or weren't emphasized. For instance, Killer Instinct recognizing your face and instantly offering your gamer preferences? That's gaming innovation. I love it.

So I had a change of heart, got a refund for my ps4 preorder, and luckily still had time to reserve a day one edition xbox one.

To make me feel even dumber, I began to understand that the very things that I was previously irritated about before were the things that made so many of xbone's cool features possible. For instance, the removal of the DRM policies made it impossible to instant switch from a blu ray to a physical game disc. I don't know how much I would've done this, but now I know I can't.

Also, now the concept of buying digital downloads creates new issues like preorder bonuses, an issue for which I still haven't seen a concrete solution. I never cared about the family sharing issue, but I'm sure there are other ways the DRM policy reversal has weakened the potential of the xbone that I don't even know about.

So I suppose that what I'm saying is:

1) Sorry Microsoft for doubting your intentions after you've made so many of my gaming experiences phenomenal over the past eight years with 360

2) Sorry gaming community, for jumping on the hate Microsoft bandwagon for awhile there

3) How the hell was someone like me who considers himself to be (at least) a semi-intelligent, independent thinker--someone who actually did his own research--so misinformed about the potential and value inherent to the Xbox one?"	t5_2xbci	True

*Worst Case Scenario:* Yet another big-budget MMO that is a solid design but fails to bring any new gamers into the genre. TESO is seen as a sub-par experience that tries to do too many things at once.

1372081742.0	1gyux2	Anyone else given up on Neogaf?	anothercreativename	83	35	91	"Up until the X1 fiasco, I was really impressed with Neogaf. The community is absolutely huge but I found the lack of trolls and bias fanboy posts very welcome. Of course there were trolls and obvious fanboys but for the size of the community, I thought they were very low in comparison with other boards. 

Now, it seems like the majority of topics/posts are extremely ignorant and trollish towards the x1 and Microsoft. It seems like the new unmentioned rule of Neogaf is that users must come up with the most creative way to spout negative comments about Microsoft/X1, truth and facts not necessary. 

I was able to tolerate the semi-often Nintendo is doomed, Nintendo should go third party and Nintendo games are always the same posts. Neogaf now seems like a breeding ground of negativity towards anyone but Sony and I'm not quite sure it's worth it to keep visiting the boards. Does anyone else feel this way?

For example, the topic about Microsoft investing $700K in their cloud infrastructure is just ridiculous. If Sony, Nintendo or Microsoft invest that kind of money in their online infrastructure, it's obviously a good thing. Yet, we get comments like this:

&gt;Sounds like bullshit. 700 million to be stuck up the clouds of developers to keep games exclusive for 6 to 12 months.  

&gt;""the cloud"" is as of yet unproven for anything other than storage.


&gt;That's Microsoft for you. Throw as much money at the wall hoping some of it sticks.


&gt;$700 million? Sounds pretty finite to me.


&gt;I know what it is, but there's a lot of uncertainty about what teh cloud actually is.


&gt;ITT: Microsoft fanboys arguing that ""da powa of da clowd"" isn't a money-burning useless gimmick.


&gt;i dont quite understand why they are just moving dump trucks of money and throwing it everywhere. i guess they dont care about budgeting/profit that much just as long as everyone else doesn't make more money than them


At least there are a couple of people who are noticing the the ridiculous nature of Neogaf.


&gt;There's nothing negative in this, nothing. Not even a speck. A robust and flexible server structure is...quite a good thing actually....Yet the atmosphere and comments in here..something better reserved for a disease outbreak of some sort...It's like straight out of bizarroworld.

I believe Microsoft will unveil something groundbreaking to developers at the Build conference taking place in a week. 

http://www.buildwindows.com/Announcement

They talked xbox at Build 2012, but I think they will go all out this year and I think it makes perfect sense. This is where they are going to clear up any inconsistensies. Think about it. They have a new console, a new form of entertainment, a new platform to build.

The Xbox One announcement was more of a quick overview, hardware and cable tv announcment.

E3 they announced games, games, and more games.

At Build they will talk about developers and something we haven't heard about at all (The Xbox One ""Store""/""Marketplace"").

They have told us that we will be able to buy full games. With that said, I believe that will require an entire restructuring of the way that Xbox 360 handles sales now. Included in my theory is that they may try to integrate more heavily Xbox games and Windows game. Every ""Arcade"" game is now on Windows 8 and vice versa. Boom. Indie games and Indie Devs make a comeback, and target a huge audience.

Let's say you're texting someone, then decide to play some BF4. You have smartglass installed on your phone, so just launch that, then boot up BF4. Whenever your phone gets a message, it pops up on your TV through the xbox, readable in a small part. To respond, wave an arm for kinect or something, then you just speak your reply. The Xbox will translate to text and send it for you. It would be a good way to keep you in the game while still talking to your friends.   Just a thought.	t5_2xbci	True

1374527930.0	1iu8mr	Audio processing improvements to the new Kinect need to be better understood. Here's a small effort in that direction. (Essay length, sorry.)	Larry_Mudd	57	8	19	"One of the areas that it seems Microsoft hasn't been entirely successful about getting their message out about is how well the new Kinect works for voice communications.  This is clear from comments from people worried about the absence of a bundled chat headset or backwards compatibility with the old headsets creating a poor multiplayer chat experience. When you know what to expect from the new Kinect, (if anything) you will be more worried about people using 360 headsets degrading the quality of chat than you will about them just using Kinect.

MS has been sanguine about this issue, simply saying ""Kinect will work well enough for people who don't have a headset,"" and leaving it there - and it is totally natural that people are skeptical, because they are relating it to their experience with the current Kinect and thinking that it will be more-or-less like that.  It will not.  It is normal that people doubt that a distant device sitting next to a huge source of noise can perform as well as a close-speak mic, but (amazingly) it will - and certainly better than a 360 headset.

[Here is a demo showing the result of signal processing on the Kinect 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dSefGxnThc&amp;t=2m19s), and the quality of audio passed through for chat/voice recognition/etc.  Just a nice clear voice, spoken perfectlly normally, with all noise and reverberation subtracted.  This is where people generally say ""That *has* to be fake,"" ""Noise cancellation just doesn't work that way, it's impossible,"" or ""It's not going to work that well in the real world.""

The thing is, it *is* that good.  It has to be, and decent headset-free chat is just a minor side benefit.  This has been an area of Microsoft research for more than a decade (with the aim of improving mechanical dictation, teleconferencing, and other deadly-dull business applications,) and they've fecking perfected it.  Without this technology, using distant speech voice recognition for UI navigation wouldn't be practical at all..  I don't think most gamers have a clear idea of just how much more advanced the signal processessing is on the Kinect 2 than it is on the current Kinect.  (There is an order of magnitude of difference, here.)   I will do my best to articulate that a bit:

The current Kinect already does some cool stuff to clean up an audio signal - and it is obviously much better than you'd get if you just stuck a sensitive mic up a few meters away and talked at it, because it uses a microphone array and spatial filtering to attenuate ambient noise and room reverberation, making the spoken word clearer.  This is very helpful but not perfect - if you listen to the output from beamforming, you can usually still hear noise in the background if the environment is noisy - it's muffled, but there -  This sort of signal processessing can only do so much.  This is why the current kinect (while still very cool) sometimes misses the mark with its voice recogntion, requiring you to repeat yourself or picking up false positives from TV dialog.

The new Kinect still uses beamforming like the old Kinect, but there are additional layers of signal processing algorithms which are applied to the output of the beamformer.  Where the beamforming algorithms mainly exploit what we know about acoustics, the most exciting of these new algorithms exploit a deep knowledge of how voice is modulated.  Beamforming applies sort of rigid transormations to the signal to amplify the desired source sound and cut everything else out as much as possible - but it's not the end goal anymore - from there, the signal is further dereverberated using spatio-temporal averaging to clean it up as much as possible for voice isolation.

Voice isolation is where things get intense. The cleaned signal is fed through glottal-synchronous speech processing algorithms.  This breaks up the waveform of the incoming speech signal by identifying the glottal openings and closures and working on these segments as individual problems.   If your sample is taken in an noisy environment, these are still going to have a bit of noise in it.  The new Kinect's firmware is going to seperately process those bits, identify whether they are voiced or unvoiced speech, and apply additional algorithms as appropriate for each of these cases, to model the waveform of the signal (speech) without any trace of the noise.  Output from these algorithms at various stages is fed through a rake receiver  to self-correct and improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The speech is *resynthesized* and streamed out in realtime.  This means voice and voice only gets passed on for speech synthesis or voice communication - it's done instantaneously and at the hardware level, so there's a nice clean voice signal for Skype or games or whatever.  If you're not math-phobic, you may enjoy a fascinating 90-minute presentation from 2011, detailing the nuts-and-bolts of some of these concepts here: [Microphone array signal processing: beyond the beamformer](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/video/default.aspx?id=152104).

This signal is actually likely to be better than we're used to with a 360 headset mic - not just because 360 headset mics are prone to picking up ambient noise and room reverberation (which will be absent with the Kinect 2's chat) but also because they have a very poor bitrate, compared with what we will have WiFi Direct or the Kinect's USB3 connection.  

This is one of those ""Holy shit!"" things about the new Kinect hardware that has had me geeking out hard for the Xbox One ever since details started trickling out.  On the one hand, I feel like Microsoft has dropped the ball a bit with regard to getting the word out, but on the other hand, it *is* a bit of a wordy word - it's hard to explain to people *why* it will work as well as expected, in easily-digestible little soundbites.  This is one of those things where seeing is believing, but if you can't wait to see it, you can also be persuaded with a couple of hours of reading."	t5_2xbci	True

The guide will be nice, the voice commands will be nice, the favorites, and the event specific apps like NFL Fantasy Stats will be nice.

But SWITCHING...SWITCHING looks to be a killer app.

I'll be watching Live TV and having game invites pop up in the corner that I can accept, and then continue watching until a multiplayer match is ready to go, then in a flash, jump right in.  Almost instantly.  Literally any time my Television is on, I'll have access to my friends list, and I'll be able to get notifications if someone's available to play.

Microsoft hasn't discussed snapping TV yet, but imagine if I really didn't want to miss out on a multiplayer match after getting the game invite, but I also didn't want to miss whatever I was watching on TV...say a sports game, or an high profile interview, or an infomercial ;)  I'd love to snap that TV to the side and get started on the multiplayer, while still being able to finish the program I was watching.   I don't see why this couldn't be done.

I guess my point is to say that the TV TV TV TV that /r/gaming made so much fun of, is seriously exciting to me.  It's not about TV, it's about the switching, and the fact that Xbox live is constantly available instantly no matter what you do on your Television.

EDIT: [Added Additional Video showing the NFL features, but even for people like myself not interested in the NFL stuff, it gives you a good idea of switching content in the UI](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N57j0bwmP5s&amp;noredirect=1)"	t5_2xbci	True

&gt; **EDITORIAL**

*Why it’s important:* This was one of the big games showed at MS’s E3. It’s a large open world with a high population of slow zombies. For those who played Dead Rising 1 and 2, weapon crafting is back but timed missions are gone. There is also some facets of multiplayer via smartglass.

*Best Case Scenario:* A strong game that people will play well after release day. The story is interesting enough to warrant multiple playthroughs.

*Worst Case Scenario:* The game is forgotten only a few months after release as it is overshadowed by bigger and better games.

Notes:

*Discussion Prompts*

* Is Dead Rising a strong enough franchise to carry a launch? Will it be overshadowed by other games?

* What would you like to see changed from previous games? What would you like to stay the same?

* What kind of multiplayer would you be interested in?

1371727886.0	1gpz2i	Microsoft can now slowly implement its original plans over time.	xScruffMcgruffx	79	32	29	"Like many of you here, I was completely content with Xbox One's original plans, restrictions and innovations. With them changing their policies, we need to stop looking to them as if they are gone forever. Here's why....

The code, UI, effectiveness were there! They arent going to simply press Ctrl + A and delete it all. 

This gives the company time to slowly roll out plans by creating appropriate policies and options. All while enabling fans to ease into the transition. 

Think of the long term! People don't want immediate change. But a gradual and calculated nudge will allow all these features to be welcome with open arms. 

They changed their policies very quickly. Microsoft isn't dumb and they clearly listen to gamers now. This means that they can further work on features and policies that will be beneficial to both parties. 

So I'm asking us to be happy that they listen to us. No matter the change being good or bad, they heard us. This company has vast knowledge and deep pockets. We don't need to say we need stuff ""NOW!"". All we have to do is to let them know that their original plan is still desired in some aspect. So RELAX everyone. If Microsoft is anything, they are innovative. And they won't let a good idea die forever. 

Please let this all be known to fellow Xbox fans. Thank you guys for your time."	t5_2xbci	True

1374428603.0	1irchr	SmartGlass Uses for Gaming?	StingerNLT	58	14	74	"So over the past month or so everyone's been focused on Kinect and what it can/cannot do.   And as much as I am looking forward to seeing what developers come up with for that, I am equally-if-not-more interested in seeing how developers were going to incorporate Smartglass into games.    

Now we know about the base things like the enhanced matchmaking, and how Capcom is using it in Dead Rising 3 as a map and waypoint selector, and how Ryse is going to make some extensive use of it.     So my question to the Reddit community is, what kind of thinks would you like to see in Smartglass integration on games?    

I'm going to start with something near and dear to me in the Dreamcast days of having the VMU.    One of my favorite uses of the VMU in NFL 2K was being able to call my plays without my opponent seeing them.    I'd love to see Madden incorporate play-calling AND pre-snap adjustments into the SmartGlass.    Imagine having an X's/O's style chart on the touchscreen where you can make your adjustments AND draw hot routes?     I could get into that!

1371728466.0	1gpzfk	Any of the Xbros / Onesies still standing by MS? I know I am.	Mitchel_C95	115	71	171	"With yesterday's announcement, I felt somewhat disheartened that these announcements had come to life and we, the minority who stuck by MS, had just been let down and, in theory, pushed back a generation. 

Although I was disheartened by the announcement, like many I was mainly let down by the scrapping of the Family Sharing [such an innovative idea], I am still looking forward to the new feature that MS is offering. 

&gt;The cloud system and digital download library are still big things for me.    
&gt;Console exclusives such as Ryse, Titanfall, Halo etc, still get me excited as hell! 
&gt;The new kinect features, I.E snapping of windows, are still a huge factor for me. 

Saying that, I, like many others, believe MS need to make digital downloads appealing. 
State to the consumer that if they were to buy direct from the digital marketplace that these features, such as family sharing, could still be in place would be a huge victory in the so called ""console war"". I have seen people stating things such as early access to DLC or cheaper fees for paying for the game through the market place. 

Heck, I know it seems a bit backwards and I am basically offering MS my wallet, but even if they stuck a £2/ $2 charge a month on the family sharing so it could be in place [Although I would see no reason for them to charge}, I would sign up straight away. 

TL;DR - The fact of the matter is, I will be sticking by MS' side until the bitter end, not as a fan boy, but as someone who believes they can be the reason to push this generation forward. 

[Edit] : Turns out Family Sharing would have been capped. I.E. One of my friends could have played my game for about an hour, then had to have purchased it to carry on. Try before you buy kind of scenario. "	t5_2xbci	True

*Why it’s important:* This is going to be a good metric of the XB1 community, since we’ll be able to share and try out other people’s worlds and games. From the E3 video it looks like you can create just about anything.

*Best Case Scenario:* A constantly updating database means you can always try out someone’s new creation, with some sort of voting system so the worlds can be shared publicly. Everyone and their dog makes their own world making the content virtually endless.

*Worst Case Scenario:* The best worlds get voted up quickly and no content turnover means that there isn’t much incentive to create. Important content goes behind a paywall, severely limiting resources.

* How much time do you expect to spend with Project Spark?

* How open are you to exploring, voting, and otherwise experiencing other people’s work?

* Do you see yourself spending money on any of the extras?

1371513959.0	1gjvtd	Why Xbox One is actually consumer friendly.	KingShango	102	61	107	"Used Games

Good news, you can still complain about Gamestop when it’s time to trade in your old games. Used games really aren’t changing much:

” Today, some gamers choose to sell their old disc-based games back for cash and credit. We designed Xbox One so game publishers can enable you to trade in your games at participating retailers. Microsoft does not charge a platform fee to retailers, publishers, or consumers for enabling transfer of these games. ”

Obviously with Xbox’s load and license requirement there may be an extra step but this is essentially the status quo and the same position as Sony.

Sharing

You can still give games to your friends, unfortunately you can only do it once. This is arguably Microsoft’s worst new policy but its more than made up for by one of their best new features; Family Sharing. 

Being able to share with 10 friends is a HUGE development that MS needs to brag about more. It makes Sony’s game swap video look ridiculous and antiquated. With Xbox One there’s no need to swap discs or wait to get them back. And if I have 15 games my friends can try as many as they want without borrowing my whole library. For someone like me that lives far away from most of my friends this is awesome.

Game Business Model

But MS best new idea and most consumer friendly is that they are trying to change the whole video game business model. Consider Killer Instinct, you can buy the whole game outright or you can go free-to-play with one character, Jago, and purchase more if you choose. I’ve also read that they will be offering a subscription-type season pass model. Three different ways to play one game. If you’re a Jago fan you get an entire video game for free. If you absolutely have to play Orchid that’s your choice too. You get to decide exactly what the game is worth to you. Project Spark is also rumored to be free-to-play. 

Obviously not all Xbox One game will offer these type of options but just the fact that MS is trying something new should be considered fantastic news. If people want the amazing deals that Steam offers they’re more likely to eventually get them on Xbox One. If a 24 hour check-in is required to stamp out piracy so be it.

This is about as consumer friendly as it gets. MS is essentially getting out of the way and letting publishers create their own business model. Consumers will get to vote with their wallets.

This is great and should be celebrated but the quality of posts and comments have been getting worse and worse. There have been more and more people trying to simply get karma by trashing IGN and Gamestop. I realize that IGN lean heavily toward Sony, but when did having an opinion opposite to your become so horrible. If you think that they are being bad journalists than don't go to their website. They are running a business and will try to do anything that can earn them more money. If it is being biased, unfair, or even trying to post stuff that stars flamewars, then that is there choice. Nobody ever said that you have to read them. I had a chance to meet Greg Miller. He is a very big fan of playstation. It did not make him a bad guy. He was one of the nicest people I have ever met. We actually had a very good conversation about games. This was a while ago and really the reason I went to IGN to read news. Gamestop is being trashed too as of late. You have to realize that people working at Gamestop are not always the most educated when it comes to video games or systems. Some employees can have a contempt for a certain console. I went to Gamestop to pre-order the X1 and the guy was telling me about the console and how excited he was to get it. There  is no prime directive from corporate to bash the Xbox. This is just as bad as people saying the that the xbox is there to spy on you solely. These places are not there to hurt you. Bashing them is not adding anything intelligent to the conversation about the X1. I am here to hear news. Not attack other things. I just want to have good conversations. I am sorry this is so long.

1375870758.0	1jvi7a	Xbox One standby power consumption details	gruenel	41	2	35	"German site 4players asked Microsoft a few questions including power states.

Seems like in standby, the console uses 14W of power while listening to ""Xbox on"" and only 0.5W when this feature is disabled.

14W may not sound like much but energy prices here in Germany average about ~€0.28/kWh (Source: Wikipedia), over the course of a year this will amount to as much as ~€35. Not exactly a ""green"" feature and way too much for me to use it. I'm glad I can just turn this off and use the controller to turn on the machine.

I don't know about US prices, I think they are less than half of that.

The interview:

&gt; **Q: Are there any details Microsoft is willing to provide regarding the power consumption? What about the low-powered state?**

&gt; A: When it’s ready to respond to “Xbox On” it uses about 14 watts, which is about five US cents (or about four Euro cents) per day. In its lowest power state, Xbox One uses only a ½-watt, which is less than about a half a U.S. cent or one-third of a Euro cent per day. 

Note: I think the ""4 Euro cents"" figure is actually using US prices, energy prices are usually much higher than that here in the EU.

There are also a few other interesting tidbits in there:

&gt; **Q: Are there still any of the other parts of the hardware, e.g. RAM, HDD, CPU clock speed etc., potentially subject to change or are the specs more or less set in stone with the tweak of the GPU?**

&gt; A: The changes Marc detailed regarding the clock speed of the GPU were software changes to the OS.  Building a console like Xbox One entails years of planning, supply chain management, purchasing agreements for components, etc and is for the most part locked at the time you start to put development kits into the hands of developers.  

&gt; **Q: Can Microsoft rule out changes to the price point that was announced at E3? ($/€ 499)**

&gt; A: We are very confident with the value we provide at $/€ 499 and the unparalleled, all in one games and entertainment experience that Xbox One offers.

&gt; **Q: Is the Xbox One required to stand horizontally or is a vertical position possible, too?**

&gt; A: Designed as a premium entertainment system that is aesthetically at home in the living room, the console is intended to sit horizontally. Additionally, the airflow and venting system was optimized for this horizontal orientation.

No, Not because I don't have to buy one. After putting $500 down on a console $25 bucks is an afterthought, and if you are like me you've bought multiple headsets this generation...(I blame small children and cats, I'm glad the new on doesn't have the mic puff anymore) 
To me the headset promotes online gameplay and teamwork. Yes the Kinect is new and improved but the audio will not be as good as a headset in your ear, and when I'm playing with friends I don't want to watch what I say or what is said to me. It shows they want everybody online communicating with each other. This was the reason  I avoid online gameplay on the PS3 but I happy to see the PS4 was coming with a headset.

1374077901.0	1ihs4i	Next gen XBOX live gold is console based, not account. (x-post from /r/xbox360)	TheAnsiBomb	54	17	62	"Just got off the phone with XBOX support regarding a billing issue with our family plan, when the customer rep kindly informed me that with the new system the $60 gold plan will be for the console not individual gamertags.

She stated that any gamertag that plays on this console will be a 'gold'. XB360 users will still have to pay for their individual accounts still.

Also, if you are a family plan member your auto-renew will probably not happen after its next renewal period. Ours just renewed on the 13th and she said not to expect it again.

    
EDIT: /u/RegularJohn17 via /r/xboxone/ said it better than me, please upvote his reply.

&gt;You pay for gold and you have a ""home"" console where your gamertag and all your games/dlc licences live. If any other gamer tag signs in on this (even if your not signed in) they can use your gold status even if they don't pay for gold.
&gt;
&gt;If you go sign in at a friends house who doesn't have gold you can use the advantages of your gold but then when your friend signs back into his gamertag he cant use gold anymore.
&gt;
&gt;Pretty simple really. It just means that families don't need multiple gold accounts anymore. Just one per console. At least that is my understanding.

1372021878.0	1gxfc2	The Third Pillar - How Apps Could Change Everything	rastex	49	11	39	"One thing that hasn't gotten much attention is the concept of Apps and how they're going to play a role in the coming generation.

First, let's get one thing clear - Apps are a big deal. They've gone from essentially zero to a dominant force in the technology industry and have resulted in the creation of multiple tens of billions of dollars of value to the economy.

Currently there's no ""go to"" device that the mainstream public uses to connect to their TV and use apps that are designed and developed with the TV in mind. It's not a stretch to consider that Microsoft is going to be positioning the Xbox One as this device - but I make the bolder claim that they're in a better position than Sony to actually succeed at making it happen.

Gamers have obviously focused on price and tech specs (similar to Blackberry fans when the iPhone was first introduced), however what first appear as limitations or negatives, actually become very important positives in the app system.

* **5GB of Usable Ram out of 8GB** - from rumours it's been stated that developers can only use 5GB of RAM for their XB1 games, vs 7GB of RAM for PS4 games. This leaves 3GB and 1GB respectively for *other stuff*. This *other stuff* isn't just the system OS, but also random applications. We haven't really seen any of these applications from Sony other than the mentions of the standard media apps. However from MS we've seen them demonstrate a few in-house apps already - namely: Skype, NFL, twitter/social and Internet Explorer. The key thing that they've demonstrated is that these apps are running **simultaneously** with the game. My guess is that the PS4's media apps will not be accessible simultaneously with game playing - there just isn't enough memory. What this means is that on the XB1 you'll be able to have bigger and better apps that are also accessible at any time - which means you'll actually use them.

* **Kinect** - it's pretty easy to see that a game controller is not the ideal way to control a random application - and I think it'll be very clear in the future that just like touch screens won out over physical keyboards, Kinect2 is going to be the preferred way we interact with non-gaming apps. Interface will be a major handicap for app developers for the PS4 because A) Eyetoy2 isn't as good, and B) developers can't assume you'll even have it.

* **Ecosystem** - Microsoft makes Windows the most popular operating system in the world. And you can see that they've been designing their Desktop, tablet, phone and console OS' in a similar way. This is true from a aesthetic perspective, but may also be true from a development perspective. If a developer can code up an app and with minimal amount of work have it running on 3 different platforms and be available to 10s of millions of users then that makes the platform substantially more lucrative. It's the reason why people don't code for Windows Phone right now, there's just not enough devices out there. Sony doesn't have other platforms they can leverage, so their only option is to do some kind of Android compatibility. Unfortunately for them, every device that's tried to have an Android compatibility ""option"" never works.

As long as XB1 is *good enough* for TV (which it is) and *good enough* for games (which it also is) then apps may become the standard by which we judge these next consoles.

Aside: This may also be why we're not hearing too much from MS on indie games. My guess is that the divide will be between ""console games"" which are the $60 affairs we're used to, and ""app games"" which are more like iPhone/Android/PS Mini games. App games will go through the app store, meaning self-publishing, no payment for updates, etc."	t5_2xbci	True

I flip around to the video section and see the video is actually promoted on the dashboard. Cool, I click on it. Vevo app asks for an update. By now 3-4 minutes have already passed and we haven't watched any twerking.  Finally, before the video even starts, I abort the whole mission and just flip back to the TV.

That's when she brought up the PS4 is $100 cheaper and has A LOT better exclusives. I just kept silent. I have already pre-ordered my XboxOne and was just curious to what my Gamestop's opinion on it was because i figured they would have a whole lot more intel around it..instead they are bashing on MS for no reason.

**Developer:** Insomniac Games (Spyro series, Ratchet &amp; Clank series, Resistance series, Fuse)

**Publisher:** Microsoft Studios

**Insomniac Games CEO:** Ted Price

**NA Release Date:** [TBA] (XB1)

**Kinect:** N/A

**Smartglass:** N/A

**Exclusive:** Yes

---

&gt; **EDITORIAL**

*Why it’s important:* It’s an open-world shooter with a bright color palette. Probably more important is how vehemently Ted Price is endorsing the use of XB1’s cloud. He insists that being connected online will allow his team to be constantly updating and bringing new things into the game.

*Best Case Scenario:* An online shooter that is as slick as it is fun. Quick turnaround on updates keep the online environment alive and burgeoning.

*Worst Case Scenario:* The game releases in an unpolished state with intent to finalize things once it’s in consumer hands. The game is the second coming of Brink.

Notes:

Insomniac Games’ most recent release Fuse was bad because it was uninteresting and indistinguishable from the entire realm of shooters that have inhabited the last generation. Sunset Overdrive does not appear to suffer the same issues.

Watch an interview with Ted Price about Sunset Overdrive on twitch [here](http://www.twitch.tv/insomniacgames/b/419633565)

Notice the extensive usage of billboards and advertising in the trailer.

*Discussion Prompts*

* Where do you think a shooter like this will fit alongside games like Titanfall and Halo? Can these games coexist?

* What do you think is the significance that Insomniac is now developing a game for the XB1 exclusively?

* What has you excited about Sunset Overdrive?

**Kinect:** Yes

**Exclusive:** Yes

**Genre:** 3rd person action, sword-based combat

---

&gt; **EDITORIAL**

*Why it’s important:* Originally announced as a Kinect game, Ryse is now one of Microsoft’s big release-day games. After its initial E3 showing where viewers were skeptical of QTE-only combat, Crytek has come back to assure us that combat will be much more fluid and complex than that. Hands-on reviews seem to support this claim.

Not much is known about the story, but a complimentary online comic was made available during ComicCon 2013.

*Best Case Scenario:* Ryse is a fun and hardcore offering with a lengthy single player campaign and interesting gladiatorial-based multiplayer. Ryse holds its ground among more established single-player franchises like Dead Rising and Assassin’s Creed.

*Worst Case Scenario:* Short campaign, clueless multiplayer.

1369331577.0	1ewzrx	Crackdown III CONFIRMED (leaked from Gametrailers.com)	Wiinii	43	6	19	"When I first went to the Gametrailers page for the Xbox One live reveal, the page was completely dressed in Crackdown III banners (sides, background, the whole thing). I was excited and told my friend, but I wasn't aware everyone else may not have been seeing it too. Now I saw a thread talking about it showing up on the dashboard during the conference and I realized it might have been an accident that I saw it.

&gt; **EDITORIAL**

*Why it’s important:* Microsoft is pretty proud of this one. A lot of attention has been given to it at conferences and expos, even going so far as to make it one of the games available to play at Comic-Con. The game will come with an extended demo mode, meaning the game is available to play with one character. The other characters will be available either individually or all together if you buy the game proper.

*Best Case Scenario:* It takes off and finds its way into the fighting league circuits. People will always find a reason to hate, but anyone who gets their hands on it knows it’s a solid game with a broad cast of characters with unique and fun moves/combos.

*Worst Case Scenario:* The negative sentiments overwhelm KI’s chances of making it outside the home. The cast is too small and the gameplay is too cheap to make it a viable competitive game.

We need a pep rally. I don't care if it's only over Xbox live, maybe they can get some of the old G4 crew back again to help. But there needs to be something to reintroduce the Xbox One and get us excited about it again. It's features, the exclusives, everything. "	t5_2xbci	True

Now with that off my chest I might point out that I live in Iceland and you might know that Iceland is not one of the supported countries for the old region lock on Xbox one and I think I don't need to explain further why I'm happy with it, yes it sucks that a lot of cool stuff has been cancelled due to the change, but the fact I finally can have a choice to buy one (because formerly there was no way that buying one would be smart because of the region lock) makes me really happy. Just wanted to share why I'm happy with it and hopefully this console will be the best!

Voice Recognition technology, I was reminded of the day that I unboxed the Kinect 1.0.

One thing I recall from classes at the College of Comp Sci at my uni, was that systems like these use what's known as an [inference engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference_engine).  This is an AI construct that uses massive databases of stored probable sentence constructs.  When software like the Siri tries to deconstruct a sentence, it starts by processing strong words (nouns, verbs) and trying to extrapolate weaker words by comparing the puzzle to a massive database of sentences to determine the highest probability of a match.  This allows computers to differentiate between ""for"" and ""four"", ""there"", ""their"", and ""they're"", and other homophones, simply by statistically guessing.

Having worked with Voice Recognition technology throughout my life, and more recently under contract to build a simulator for the Navy, I was reminded of how expensive and ineffective the software was at differentiating accents and dialects of languages.  All technology I've worked with up to this point had required a ""training"" period in which the voice processor attempted to learn and compensate for your dialect and accent.  This usually involved reading a few prepared paragraphs of text.  This is a common method in machine learning in which an AI will attempt to achieve a goal (in this case understanding what it is you are saying), and then compare its results to a base case (the stored knowledge of what the paragraph actually says) and grade its performance.  In all cases, the machines would adapt to better process your voice, but only when given constructive feedback.  You had to tell the software that it was mistaken when it misunderstood a word.  This software also had very large databases of knowledge with which it did its comparisons, and those databases needed to be expandable as the machine ""learned"".

Flash forward back to the day of unboxing the Kinect 1.0.   I was absolutely positive, as I've witnessed 100% of the time previously, that the Kinect would require some form of training considering it was being deployed to, not only an accent diverse country like USA, but also multiple countries of various languages and accents.  Shocked was I when the Kinect booted right up and started accepting simple commands.  At first I wrote it off as a common hack where you use words easily differential to normal common place words.  Words like ""Xbox"" have few commonly spoken homophones.  But when we started using the search features ""Xbox, Bing, Star Trek Nemesis"", and the system was able to get it on the first try, I was greatly impressed.  Where was the GBs of stored inference data?  I presume that the data was stored offsite and that your inquiries were being transmitted to a server, processed, and served the response not unlike how Siri works.

Now here we are today.  The newly unveiled Azure Cloud promises to be the framework for a vast cloud computer capable of crunching the most heinous of numbers, and a greater database of inferential knowledge than any other voice processor was capable of drawing upon.  Kinect 2 is reported improved over its predecessor by multitudes.  The voice processor that Microsoft had built 3 years ago seemingly solved the pre-training requirements of all other processors I've worked with.  Could it be possible that the Kinect 2 is the final step in the acceptance and ubiquity of voice recognition by common people?  I suspect it will be faster and more accurate than any other commercially available voice recognition product.  And it will be deployed to millions of people's living rooms.

&gt; *EDITORIAL*

*Why it’s important:* This is Microsoft’s answer to the “why don’t you support indie games” question. Sword &amp; Sworcery is well-lauded in the indie game world and there’s no reason to think that with the same creative force they can’t pull off another hit.

*Best Case Scenario:* Capy makes Below a must-play game. It leads the way in Microsoft’s indie game development, opening doors and showing how successful an indie game can be on the XB1 platform.

*Worst Case Scenario:* The hardcore, rogue-like gameplay takes a frustrating turn, alienating fans and selling too few copies to woo indie developers.

E3 trailer: http://youtu.be/bSM3vO3_4mQ

The game features no dialogue or text whatsoever. All cues will happen on-screen. The perspective is so far back that your character looks only a handful of pixels tall, invoking such comments as “what is this, a game for ants?”. This plays heavily into the gameplay, apparently, as Kris Piotrowski [hints in his interview with Xbox Wire](http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/e3-below-interview).

1372388666.0	1h83af	A Quick Thought on Improving Xbox One PR by Using Awkward Engineers	clisby	43	9	30	"**tl;dr engineers and architects are making Build conference enjoyable.  Replacing business people with technical people may benefit the Xbox One marketing**  - No really, you can skip the rest if you want.  That's basically it.

I believe we can mostly agree there is room for improvement in Microsoft's presentation of Xbox One.  After having a blast watching the MS Build developer conference for something like 10 hours over the last two days (don't laugh), I believe I figured out a potential way to improve Xbox One's marketing.     

At Build, the speakers are engineers and architects.  They appear human, often make mistakes, are often socially awkward, and get flustered.  *But* they seem genuinely excited for their product, technology and to be a part of Microsoft.  Their excitement is sincere and not manufactured.  A few of them are flat out hilarious.  One guy was drawing horrible looking kittens and deathstars but I ate it up.  I related to them.  He was a brother in this crazy, exciting IT world.  Ballmer spoke briefly but seemed very out of place and further reinforced the divide between the business and development sides.         

At E3, if an engineer made a mistake, misspoke or looked dumb I believe I could have forgiven him.  It would have been endearing.  But to counter their potential for disaster, an engineer is less likely to improvise and try to deflect questions.  They know the depths of the technology they helped create and aren't expected to go into a vast array of other topics.  A simple ""I don't have that information, but can ask"" is understandable when you talk to an engineer.  When you speak to a VIP of the business side of the product and they dodge a question it can seem off-putting.      

These figure-heads can seem excited about how people will like their product, but it's nothing like seeing the sincere excitement of someone who is so proud of their baby - they desperately want people to accept it because they are proud of something that took them 60+ hours a week of work, stressful deadlines and they find revolutionary.  They are *emotional* about it, and it is infectious whether you care about what they speak of or not. 

Just to show the difference: At the Xbox One announcement and E3 we got some business guys saying ""cloud.""  At Build we got a Service Architect from 343 Studios talking about how cloud PaaS is revolutionizing how they can communicate with gamers.  He was excited.  The information he presented was accessible and would have taken very little to make more non-coder friendly.

Out of all the issues that arose early, Major Nelson seems to have remained squeaky clean -- even after the switch statement..  He has the technical knowledge, is a gamer and we pretty much all seem to love him for his sincerity (and ability to own up to a goof).  That's the type of person that needs to represent the Xbox One, IMO.

So let me ask everyone this, would you have enjoyed E3 more if awkward, yet excited engineers and architects presented details about the console and games?  Then a first party developer such as Respawn could actually mention detailed cloud benefits on-stage like he did on his website.  Hearing a figure-head cheer about a cloud, of which he probably knows little, seems less meaningful than hearing a major developer.  Or perhaps you believe a slick figure-head is the better way to go, due to their wider business knowledge and speaking experience?  Do you have another idea?  How do you think this would effect your perception of Xbox One and Microsoft?    

As a side-note, it's difficult to explain what Microsoft is doing for accessible cloud computing if you aren't a developer.  But it is sick.  You will see the results on your PC and console soon -- there's really not much of a need to stress about ""is it really going to help my PC/Xbox?"" prior to you seeing what devs do with it.  S-I-C-K.  Their ubiquitous cloud integration for VS got me *excited to code* in a way I haven't been in a decade.  But I digress. 

EDIT:  The 343 Service Architect is at http://channel9.msdn.com/?wt.mc_id=build_hp   starts at 3:25:00.  It's a tad on the technical side but could have fairly easily been worded for a non-developer crowd.     
EDIT 2: Sorry for the verbosity -- downloading the Visual Studio 2013 Preview so I can start writing some apps ;)    
EDIT 3: Bunch of good points down in the comments.  Perhaps there is a middle ground where they could webcast a technical round-table with some of the architects/engineers on Xbox One innards, outards and development done outside any of the major gaming events. 30-60 minutes."	t5_2xbci	True
1372325852.0	1h63ww	Some needed clarification on Xbox One's memory	UKPC	53	18	113	"I've noticed some information going around about the Xbox One's memory lately that has been bugging me, mainly the following:

 * Microsoft has locked developers to only 5GB of memory, while reserving 3GB for the system.
 * Xbox One only has 68.3 GB/s bandwidth, and PS4 has a much faster [176 GB/s] bandwidth.

Let me address these two things below.
***
###5GB/3GB Nonsense

From what I can gather, most of this information about the 5GB/3GB issue stems back to this [Game Informer article](http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/05/21/xbox-hardware-evolution-chart.aspx), which has **NO SOURCES** for their information on this. There was also this [transcribed] [interview with Mark Whitten](http://www.handytips.info/1141/microsoft-xbox-one-has-5gb-ram-usable-for-games-3gb-for-os/), but he neither confirmed nor denied. Truly, if you have a valid source where someone from Microsoft specifically states this information, tell me. Until then, when Ars Technica [interviewed Matt Booty](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/05/how-the-xbox-one-draws-more-processing-power-from-cloud-computing/), General Manager of Redmond Game Studios, he had this to say about Xbox One's memory:

&gt;The 8GB of RAM in the Xbox One is accessible as one unified chunk and can be divvied up between the GPU and the CPU dynamically. ""Different kinds of games will want to use the CPU, the GPU, and the RAM differently, Booty said. ""If we were to try to determine ahead of time how you wanted to divide RAM up between video RAM, main RAM, and audio RAM, we’re making a lot of assumptions, and when you make assumptions you start to limit the people who are going to be making games going forward.""

###Memory Bandwidth

&gt; **EDITORIAL**

*Why it’s important:* Don’t call it a movie tie-in, but the coincidence of the upcoming Mad Max movie and this game is hard to ignore. We haven’t seen much yet, but the inclusion of death-dealing vehicles could be enough to separate it from other similar outings.

Oh, and they changed the voice actor to one with an Australian accent.

*Best Case Scenario:* Rage by id Software could have very well been a Mad Max game, and Avalance would do well to see how that game ended up. Open-world is in vogue, but if Avalanche can come up with something as fun as Just Cause then there is still hope.

*Worst Case Scenario:* There’s not a lot of positive buzz yet, so the worst case scenario is that our expectations of an ill-fitting and loose-playing game come true.

But when searched it led to respawn's own blog about their heavy reliance on [azure](http://www.respawn.com/news/lets-talk-about-the-xbox-live-cloud/). Any answers and sources would be great. Why is this being said? And where is it confirmed? Thanks.

EDIT: Answers-

**The Why** =Titantfall is the only Announced Exclusive not a Microsoft owned franchise or published by Microsoft

**The Confirmation** = Forum Speculation (Will update when source or precedent is contributed)

**The Quotes** =

 ""Working on a sole platform allows you to focus your resource and engineering time. There's always a fixed cost with doing things, but this fixed cost varies per platform. You kind of have to compromise each thing you do to fit it into each respective architecture. It just allows you to really laser-focus what you do, how you do it, and what you put into a game. There are not triple the amount of issues you potentially have for every platform you add. It just opens a can of worms.

Smartglass features will add several potential layers to games AND entertainment. Some games will be like playing a smartphone game with next-generation power behind it. The potential is vast.

300,000 servers dedicated to Xbox Live on day one alone. Multiplayer games will play even more smoothly on the already superior live network. Along with free games, and an already top notch marketplace and app center, the xbox live subscription is more than worth it.

New age Kinect technology that is actually innovative enough to bring us into the future of gaming when it comes to voice and motion recognition. This is an actual step in the future folks. Again, the potential here is vast.

Improvement over the already superior controller. PS4 has a touchpad yes, we have smartglass... yes.

The all notorious, but cool nonetheless, live tv and os switching capabilities. 

Twitch streaming and Skype bulit in.

The PlayStation exclusives are dropping like flies. Can anyone say Metal Gear Solid(can't wait!)? Xbox exclusives on the other hand are surprisingly stacked. Quantum Break for me. You can pick your own exclusives...

I have broadband internet, rarely trade in my games and rarely lend them to more than one person. 

If you cant afford 499 then you probably shouldnt even be spending 399 folks. 100 price difference over the course of one generation of consoles is a bargain for a truly innovative console with new ideas and ways to game and interact online. 

This is all I can think of now. I'm sure the comments will have some other pros for this console.

XboxUncut	47	16	52	"**This is just something that has been driving around my head for days now and needed to get out before I went crazy(The Gamespot ""The Point"" linked below is what broke the camels back for me) so no need to upvote.**

I've been basically glued to the Xbox One since the beginning rumblings of the console and have watched and understood Microsoft's plan for the system.  However lately due to the reversals that were caused by the community itself that same community is turning their backs on the system and saying it no longer has a identity.  This is false in my mind as the Xbox One still has the original identity that the Xbox always strives for and that is to be the center device for your living room.

Now we have outlets such as Gamespot even repeating such drivel while using 4:1 Netherlands sales as facts for sales in every region.

[The Point - Why The Xbox Is Losing](http://www.gamespot.com/shows/the-point/?event=why-the-xbox-is-losing-20130814)

All of Microsoft's back pedaling so far was done for the community and their fears and the decisions they made will help them as they go further.  Microsoft has already said they wish to continue their plans on some of the features removed from the first policy reversal including the Family Share Plan. 

[Adam Sessler - Xbox One's Indie Surprise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG8zcMRUOHI)

Even Adam Sessler said that he couldn't find any mention that Microsoft would never support Xbox One self-publishing for Indies.  I went even further and tracked down the most likely quote that this idea was true and that they said specifically no to self publishing and found that not to be true.

[Xbox One won't allow indies to self-publish games](http://www.shacknews.com/article/79309/xbox-one-wont-allow-indies-to-self-publish-games?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter)

&gt; ""as of right now, yes. We intend to continue to court developers in the ways that we have."" - Matt Booty

&gt; ""I would also expect that for this new generation, that we're going to continue to explore new business models and new ways of surfacing content. But Microsoft Studios is a publisher that works with a wide range of partners, as do a lot of other people, to bring digital content to the box."" - Matt Booty

As can be seen in the quotes above even Microsoft on May 22nd said they will be continuing to explore new business models and never said they wouldn't specifically support self-publishing in the future.  Should this really be considered a reversal of their policies when they had no policies saying they wouldn't on Xbox One?

Now we move onto Kinect where people continue to forget that from the very beginning you were capable of turning all the features off(even Xbox On) and Microsoft basically took the extra step and are now allowing people to disconnect the Kinect.  This in the end helps Microsoft sell more consoles by alleviating NSA fears while still selling a Kinect with every console.  Microsoft has come out again and put their foot down on the Kinectless bundle not happening and I'm very happy about this even if Gamespot wants to pretend it didn't happen.

[Albert Penello - Kinectless Bundle not happening](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=76053443&amp;postcount=338)

I guess what I'm trying to say is that Microsoft hasn't lost it's identity through these changes but only given the community and developers more options on their console and help alleviate the fears of consumers and developers.  Microsoft is continuing to be the more innovative console with unique features and that hasn't changed.

* Visual recognition with seamless profile/controller/settings/orientation switching.

* Voice recognition system that can allow you to turn everything on and enjoy content without having to find a remote control.

* Dedicated servers with a brand new smart match and reputation system.

* HDMI-IN, Snapping Apps and Twitch.TV streaming with Picture in Picture(maybe green screen) capabilities using Kinect.

* Integrated Skype as the main communication service allowing you to chat with anyone that has Skype.

* Brand new achievement that can continually add achievements and challenges throughout a games lifespan.

* Stereo audio through headsets using a single cord with 24 Khz up/down 16-bit uncompressed audio.

* $100,000,000 controller with rumble triggers and tons of improvements.

* Nearly inaudible console that is built with reliability first.

When I look over the facts in my mind I find it funny how people think the Xbox One no longer has a identity or unique features...

*Why it’s important:* Titles like these are often the most addicting. Try to mention Rollercoaster Tycoon in /r/games without getting replies from people who remember the game fondly. If it can offer a unique enough experience then the title could have some staying power.

*Best Case Scenario:* Simulators have a lot of intangibles. We hope Zoo Tycoon has the ones that make things like management and building more fun than looking at spreadsheets. Kinect integration could make interactions more fun (this is the developer that made Kinectimals).

*Worst Case Scenario:* More of a Thrillville than a Rollercoaster Tycoon.

TL;DR included for the lazy ;) Discussion Welcome	Roflcopterer	54	22	115	"In all honesty I understand the complaints of people in regards to the Kinect 2.0 being bundled with the Xbox One. I understand people see it as a pointless brick that will be mandatory for the Xbox One to function. I can see how people are paranoid that the Kinect will track your voice and “spy” on you, although I see this as completely bogus, no one at the NSA wants to see all the boring, monotonous stuff we do all day at home. 

I see the reason for hate and complaints; however, I believe the Kinect makes the purchase of the Xbox One sting a little less.  I, being a family man (no not a 12 year old), realize that the Kinect is the perfect EXCUSE to buy the Xbox One. I most likely will not be using the features but my family will love it, at least for a small period of time. So when I go to buy the Xbox One I will show my wife all the “cool” features of the Xbox One and it will make the purchase a lot easier.

I know I am going to get grief about people saying I should not have to justify the purchase if I was a “real man” and blah blah blah. I realize this and I would be buying the system either way but it will be much easier if my wife is on board and excited for it too.

That is why I am glad the Kinect is bundled with the Xbox One

I don't know how many of friends are getting the Xbox One on launch day so I figured why don't we compile a list of gamertags so on launch day we can play online together. If you think it's a dumb idea than just ignore me, but since there's not limit on friends for the Xbox One, why not?

UPDATE: jnapp18 made a Google docs form where you can submit your gamer tags and it will add them to an excel doc.

1371065938.0	1g7sz3	XB1: I'm actually looking forward to moving forward!	whyunoname	68	38	39	"I want to first talk about the last launch.  The price of the PS3 was $599.  360 was $100 dollars cheaper.  Zero fucks given.  A big deal was made regarding the PS3 having Bluray.  You can do more like watch movies!  Fast forward to the current release.  PS4 -- we just want gaming, nothing else.  Look, it's $100 dollars cheaper!  Let's not forget MS comes with the Kinect.  Add the Eye to the PS4 and it's a $40 dollar difference.  Oh right, and PSN is free.  Well, now if you want the good features then you have to pay.  I'm not bashing either I'm just pointing out the same thing was reversed last time and it was Pro-Sony.

I feel the XB1 is cutting edge, the PS4 is just another upgrade that is right in line every other release.  Better specs, nothing more.  The PS hardware is slightly better than the XB, but not backed by 300K+ Azure servers for [cloud](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/05/how-the-xbox-one-draws-more-processing-power-from-cloud-computing/) computing.  It won't be a major difference at launch, but down the road it could really make the XB1 powerful removing any performance limitations and future-proofing it.  This is a massive advantage to XB.

I'm not a huge fan of the online check-in, but most gamers play online.  I would rather XB say you install the game and if you want to play it from the HDD then you need online.  You can play offline with the disk, so the installed game checks for the disk if there is no connection.

I LOVE the steam approach.  I think it will bring the devs more money, and in the end save the customers money too.  The transition won't be easy, but imagine new games that are cheaper and the ability to sell your game to a friend or back to the devs.  It's the way everything else is or is going (see iTunes, Netflix, etc, etc.).  It's the natural progression and will happen on all systems in time.  MS just decided to do it now.

The idea of it being gaming only?  Why?  If it can do more and still match the others consoles gaming performance then it's a win.  Don't need it?  Then don't use it.

I just don't understand all of the hate.  I think the PS4 and XB1 will both be fantastic, and either choice is a win.

Edit: Added cloud reference and removed the cable box.  The ability to use XB1 as another box may be added on a later date but right now it is just a pass-thru.

1376696413.0	1kiqxr	Dear Microsoft: TIMESPLITTERS 4	Notramagama	49	21	19	"Microsoft, Timesplitters is the perfect series to resurrect for Xbox 1. Considering how well your partnership is going with Crytek, who owns the license for Timesplitters, there is no better time to resurrect the series. In addition, Timesplitters is the FPS people need right now. Everyone is tired of serious/COD like shooters. Timesplitters may be the best comedic shooter of all time. It is also a well respected series which would let gamers know Microsoft knows what type of games make for a diverse hardcore lineup.




On a side note I had the idea of what a potential plot for a Timesplitters EXCLUSIVE sequel.
Since the game uses Sergeant Cortez as its main character and Timesplitters 4 has been delayed forever it would make a great joke to make the plot of the new Timesplitters be Cortez ensuring Microsoft reaches its title as a huge gaming company, so he can finally have his new game. Cortez could have levels which revisit Halo, Gears, Crackdown, Dead Rising, Mass Effect and any other large console exclusive necessary for Microsoft to be so big. He could team up with Master Chief or Marcus Phoenix to ensure they save their universes... just a thought for a great exclusive story line. This is also only possible on Xbox since its the only system with enough exclusive shooters in a gritty universe




Anyway... PLEASE BRING US(ME) TIMESPLITTERS 4!!!! MS + CRYTEK is the perfect formula for the long awaited sequel to one of gamings best forgotten franchises.

1374149305.0	1ijyaw	Countdown to Launch | July 18 | The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt	whatdoyouwantmetosay	37	7	13	"**Title:** The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt

**Developer:** CD Projekt Red

**Publisher:** [None yet]

**Gameplay Producer:** Marek Ziemak

**Writers:** Borys Pugacz Muraszkiewicz and Marcin Blacha

**NA Release Date:** 2014

**Kinect:** No

**Smartglass:** No

**Exclusive:** No

**Genre:** Fantasy RPG, 3rd person action

Based on a popular series penned by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski, the story follows the titular witcher Geralt of Rivia. Steeped in Eastern European folklore, the previous series have been a strong counterpoint to traditional Western RPGs like Skyrim and Two Worlds.

---

&gt; **EDITORIAL**

*Why it’s important:* With a release on the 360, the Witcher 2 opened many people’s eyes to the Polish developer’s brilliance. Now with an open-world and better combat, the Witcher 3 is looking to dethrone The Elder Scrolls series as everybody’s favorite Western-style fantasy RPG.

*Best Case Scenario:* Amazing visuals bring in a mainstream crowd, but the game stays true to the series and delivers one of the few truly mature games available. A lot of customizable options for combat and gear means everyone can play a bit differently.

*Worst Case Scenario:* The Eastern European lore doesn’t click with the audience, and the open world is pretty but empty. Gamers are disappointed that they don’t play as their own created character.

Videos:

Gameplay was shown behind closed doors to a select number of journalists during E3 and the videos were not made public. For now we have just a handful of teasers and trailers.

[Debut gameplay trailer](http://youtu.be/TZ_G6XiHoUA)

[A bit of a fluff piece put out by CD Projekt Red (don’t let the unusual name fool you, these guys are legit), but great for anyone new to the series](http://youtu.be/2HGhm0H7d68)


---

*Discussion Prompts*

* How does a game like this stack with Skyrim? What do you think are some key differences?

* If you played any of the previous games, did you understand the story? Well enough to describe it to someone else?

* The Witcher is often described as adult or mature, why do you think that is? If you’re not familiar with the series, then what do you think makes a game more mature?

1373975762.0	1iep37	I just want to say thank you to Microsoft for The One.	latenightnerd	86	60	86	"This is going to be a bit lovey dovey. Just as a preface to this post, I want to say that I was all ready and willing to get the PS4 at launch and wait until next year to get an X1. I have changed my mind and am doing it the other way around now. My outlook on gaming has changed a lot in the last few months. I have been gaming since the early 80s but I would never have called myself a gamer. I've had a 360 for 7 years and have only built a gamerscore of 5000. I want to get immersed during this next generation and I want to do it primarily with the X1. I'm still going to get the PS4 eventually, but really only for exclusives.

I think a lot of negativity has been spread around about the XBOX ONE by people who didn't seem to grasp what Microsoft were trying to do. I believe were trying to usher in the future at the price of a minuscule amount of DRM. People are going to hate what I'm saying here, but I don't care. They are trying to please everyone now, and that's okay too. We will eventually get to this idea of the future they have for us. I know Microsoft are trying to get us everything the community are saying they want and also make the X1 a great product to own and experience. I have worked for large companies before. I know companies like Microsoft aren't trying to be evil. There's no money in being evil in entertainment. Screwing the consumer over is the opposite of what these large comapnies want to do. I also know that the public never seems to appreciate the work put in to making these great products. There are always going to be detractors of the work they are trying to do. I just want to say thank you for the years of effort, skill, talent, and love they obviously have for this product. Thank you for bringing it to us. "	t5_2xbci	True

**NeoGAF Summation:**

* No renting, no loaning. No private sales (unless selling to someone who has been on your friends list for 30 days)

* Console Checks in Every 24 hours

* Trade-ins are up to the publisher and only at participating retailers

* You can give a game to a friend only if they have been on your friends list for 30 days, and then it is stuck with them.

* Up to 10 family members can play your games from any console at any time

**Full Details:**


With our modern architecture, Xbox One games will load more quickly, will be always accessible from the cloud, and there is no physical limit to the size or scope of the content provided.

Here are our platform policies and capabilities for game licensing – all of which will be made available when Xbox One launches later this year:

•Buy the way you want—disc or digital—on the same day: You’ll be able to buy disc-based games at traditional retailers or online through Xbox Live, on day of release. Discs will continue to be a great way to install your games quickly.


•Access your entire games library from any Xbox One—no discs required: After signing in and installing, you can play any of your games from any Xbox One because a digital copy of your game is stored on your console and in the cloud. So, for example, while you are logged in at your friend’s house, you can play your games.


•Share access to your games with everyone inside your home: Your friends and family, your guests and acquaintances get unlimited access to all of your games. Anyone can play your games on your console--regardless of whether you are logged in or their relationship to you.


•Give your family access to your entire games library anytime, anywhere: Xbox One will enable new forms of access for families. Up to ten members of your family can log in and play from your shared games library on any Xbox One. Just like today, a family member can play your copy of Forza Motorsport at a friend’s house. Only now, they will see not just Forza, but all of your shared games. You can always play your games, and any one of your family members can be playing from your shared library at a given time.


•Trade-in and resell your disc-based games: Today, some gamers choose to sell their old disc-based games back for cash and credit. We designed Xbox One so game publishers can enable you to trade in your games at participating retailers. Microsoft does not charge a platform fee to retailers, publishers, or consumers for enabling transfer of these games.


•Give your games to friends: Xbox One is designed so game publishers can enable you to give your disc-based games to your friends. There are no fees charged as part of these transfers. There are two requirements: you can only give them to people who have been on your friends list for at least 30 days and each game can only be given once.



In our role as a game publisher, Microsoft Studios will enable you to give your games to friends or trade in your Xbox One games at participating retailers. Third party publishers may opt in or out of supporting game resale and may set up business terms or transfer fees with retailers. Microsoft does not receive any compensation as part of this. In addition, third party publishers can enable you to give games to friends. Loaning or renting games won’t be available at launch, but we are exploring the possibilities with our partners.



As we move into this new generation of games and entertainment, from time to time, Microsoft may change its policies, terms, products and services to reflect modifications and improvements to our services, feedback from customers and our business partners or changes in our business priorities and business models or for other reasons. We may also cease to offer certain services or products for similar reasons.



In the months ahead, we will continue to listen to your feedback as we meet with our partners in the ecosystem to bring additional detail about our policies.

We are excited about this new generation of games and entertainment and look forward to sharing more news with our fans. "	t5_2xbci	True

1375412496.0	1jjhd9	An idea for Day One Digital Pre-Orders	Grease2310	35	9	21	Alright, a lot of people have said they're going to go all digital only AFTER the initial launch as they can't pre-order the day one titles digitally and thus won't get the pre-order bonuses (for call of duty, battlefield, etc). What I was thinking is why doesn't Microsoft just let us pre-order the Xbox One launch titles via the existing 360 dashboard or the Xbox Live web front end?  This way we can get the pre-order bonuses and all we'll be missing out on is the ability to pre-download the data.  Any thoughts guys?  Perhaps u/majornelson can shed some light on whether or not Microsoft has considered this at all?  It seems like an elegant solution for those of us who'd love to not have any disks at all for our shiny new toy.	t5_2xbci	True

1369442505.0	1f06tu	Some insight into why Microsoft is targeting multimedia with the Xbox One and not games	dluksa	43	14	103	"If you've been anywhere near Reddit for the last few days, you're probably well aware of gamers' discontent with [the Xbox One announcement](http://www.polygon.com/2013/5/20/4348940/the-next-xbox-revealed-all-the-news-from-microsofts-next-gen-debut), considering that the front page of /r/Gaming is flooded with an onslaught of hatred towards the system. Most of this discontent is coming from the seeming lack of attention towards games, and the strong focus on multimedia. Microsoft has showed us what a great multimedia box the Xbox One is, that's for sure, but we haven't seen what it looks like with its gaming muscles flexed. Well it is my opinion that the sudden rage is somewhat justified, I'd like to offer you Microsoft's perspective on the issue.

Gamers are concerned with games, but Microsoft isn't. Microsoft would only be concerned with games if the Xbox 360 wasn't on top of the gaming market. The Xbox 360 is the top dog in the console world right now, and it looks like it's going to stay there. [The good ole' 360 has been the top selling gaming console in the United States for 28 consecutive months.](http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/archive/2013/05/16/xbox-360-continues-its-roll-at-the-top-of-the-u-s-console-market.aspx) Microsoft is not concerned with games; they've already got that locked down, despite how many enraged trolls on the internet say differently.

However, just because Microsoft is on top of the gaming market right now does not mean that it isn't going to need to change its ways to stay there. The Xbox One is going to have [some dangerous competition in the gaming world](http://us.playstation.com/ps4/), and if Microsoft wants to stay there then it needs to deliver. Not to worry though, they already know that, and I'm fairly certain that they don't need some kid from the internet to tell them that. I predict that we will see some *big* stuff at E3. Some *very big* stuff. [We've already gotten a peek at what's to come,](http://www.polygon.com/2013/5/24/4362060/xbox-one-box-art-style-forza-motorsport-5) and that's just the tip of the iceberg.

Now, I know what you're thinking. *""If Microsoft knows they need to stay on top of their game (no pun intended), then why aren't they giving us information about games?*"" The answer is somewhat simple really, and to explain it to you we are going to look to Disney. The Walt Disney Company is perhaps one of the smartest conglomerates out there, and I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft has taken note of their ways after seeing the recent Xbox One announcement.

One of Disney's seven fundamental business concepts states that *""the competition is anyone the customer compares you to"".* This concept is probably why [the Disney Cruise Line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Cruise_Lines) is a thing. Walt Disney World and Disney Land had already tackled the theme park market, but Disney was still losing business to other vacation outlets, like cruise lines. The competition is anyone the customer compares you to. Instead of traveling to a Disney theme park, customers were going on cruises. The solution? The Disney Cruise Line. The customers are free to do what they want, but Disney still makes a profit.

So how does this relate to the Xbox One at all? Well, just like customers were going on cruises as instead of going to Disney World, consumers are watching Netflix and listening to Last.fm instead of playing games. And how do you think they're doing that? With their TiVos, Rokus, Apple TVs, and iPads. The competition is anyone the customer compares you to. Microsoft doesn't care about what kind of media you are consuming, they just care about how you consume it. They want you to boot up your Xbox One instead of your Roku to finish that Breaking Bad binge. They already know that you're going to use your Xbox to play games; that part is taken care of. They just want to be sure that you're going to use your Xbox to consume all of your other media. That's why they are going to such extensive lengths to highlight the Xbox One's media capabilities.

Hopefully that clears things up. I promise you, we are going to have a kick ass E3. Microsoft knows how high the stakes are.

**TL;DR:** Microsoft already owns the gaming market. They want the multimedia market, too. All because Disney told them to."	t5_2xbci	True

That's understandable - most wii games were like that and so were a lot of early Kinect games. I think once this device gets out in the wild however, most people are going to quickly realize how Kinect makes the xbox uniquely awesome in three ways:

1. UI Control. Imagine coming Home and saying ""Xbox on""  ""Smartmatch Halo 5"" ""Watch HBO"" ""Order Pizza"" ""Dim lights"" (using one of the Windows 8 home automation apps) all while making yourself a drink. That is pretty damn cool and you can bet Microsoft is going to market the shit out of this to mainstream consumers. People will WANT this.

2. In game voice control. Does this need explanation? A quick, infinitely versatile form of input that we've never had before. The enhancements already made in Fifa and [Skyrim](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5lU0leEnbU) with Kinect 1 already have made my PS3 friends jealous.

3. Body capture. Head tracking in Forza. Using your spine as a third analog stick. Games that react to your heartrate and emotions. And yes, those dreaded gesture controls. It's always nice to have unique forms of input,  and not all gesture games are gimmicks. Dance Central has been a hit at many parties. It fills the room with music and gives people an excuse to embarrass themselves. The improved lag free body capture is also the kind of thing that will captivate the casual market, probably getting it featured on daytime talk shows. I can't imagine the PS4 making a big splash on Good Morning America. 

I saw a thread in Neogaf where people were lamenting how Sony killed their camera, but saw it as a necessary sacrifice to to kill the evil Xbone with price. Here's the problem with that (besides being cringey as hell). With generation cycles lasting 8+ years, it's safe to say most will have the opportunity to try both of the next generation consoles, regardless of a 100$ price difference. Which one ends up being the main console and which one collects dust comes down to the experience. Graphics and games are going to be pretty similar for the most part. The defining difference between the two consoles is going to be the Kinect. 

My prediction: Microsoft is going to win, probably by next holiday season. The xbox with it's 100% adoption rate Kinect offers objectively richer and more immersive interactions than it's competitor. Add in the advantages Microsoft already has with it's **controller**, cloud support, established first party franchises, and exclusives partnerships and this generation might surprise a lot of people blinded by the anti-Microsoft circlejerk."	t5_2xbci	True

1371916625.0	1guype	"If MS is telling the truth about ""Family Sharing"" they can still implement it with digital game. Here is how it can work."	alonelyheartboy	40	15	23	"Disc Games can not be a part of ""Family Sharing"", only digital downloads for obvious reasons. This will give people more incentive to buy digital and help reduce the used game market.

**Advantage of Family Share**

* 10 friends in a circle can play any games in your *shared library* 
* It is a circle of 10 friends, which means Junior will have the same 9 people as you do.
* Only one person can play a game at a time. (Think of it as a real disc)
* Multiple people can play different games in your shared library at the same time.
* No time limit + cloud save so when they buy their own copy they can continue.

**Restriction**

* You can not play your own game when your friend is playing it.
* Your ""shared library"" has a maximum of 5 games. You checkmark the 5 games to place into your library. Games can be put in and taken out at anytime when the game is not being played.
* Total of 50 games can be share between friends at one time (5 * 10).
* Games in your ""shared library"" **CAN NOT** be played offline. 
* To access ""shared library"" games (yours or your friends) you must be online.

**Problems**

* Publishers will fear that there are too many games being shared. 50 is a lot of games. MS can shrink the circle to 5 ending up with 25 games being shared between 5 friends. 25 game is still alot and this could make the publisher happier.

**Why this will work out**

* Allowing only 1 person to play the game at a giving time will discourage people from sharing that game. Players will put a game in the share library but not for long since they want to be able to play it without being locked out. Meaning others will have to buy their own copy.
* This type of sharing will be great for multiplayer games. It will get the player's friend to enjoy it and will want to make them buy it to play against each other.
* If publishers want to get rid of used games, this is the right step to take. Give people a good reason to go digital! 
* Everyone will be happy. Play digital games offline, share digital games, play disc games offline, sell disc games, lend disc games, online only if you want to share. It's all there! This is about choices and you are giving it to the consumer!

You do not need 24hr online check in since you must be online to play the games you selected to be in your *shared library*.  For games that you play all the time and don't want to be locked out of, you wouldn't put it into your *shared library*, just like with disc, you wouldn't want to lend a disc to a friend if you are playing it everyday. The choice is yours to make.

If MS is  honest about family sharing, they can still implement this without the 24hr DRM. This will be a great incentive for people to go digital!

1371233829.0	1gcpop	The golden age of Horror games	RealityinRuin	43	17	15	"Imagine this.

A game, perhaps in the vein of slender, or Amnesia the dark descent.

You begin exploring this unusual world, calm and relaxed. Your comfortable on your couch, breathing normally, heart beat calm and steady.

And the game knows this. It sees you in this state. And it begins it's assault.

Your senses are bombarded with noise, quick flashes of images or sightings of characters, fleeting. But there. You notice.

Your body notices as well. You lean towards the tv and grip the controller. Your blood starts pumping with your increased heart beat. Your breathing becomes heavier and your skin is flushed. 

And the game sees this.

The game ramps up the oddness. More visual flashes of things just barely there, a subliminal image pops up to quick for you to see but your brain registers the image. Your becoming terrified, and you can't control it. 

The game sees this. It has brought you to the edge. You are now ready, the moment when slender appears to you and catches you off gaurd.

But the game brings you back down. It stops the weirdness, brings you back down to normal. Your heart rate slows, you relax. You glance away from the tv for something, a drink, your phone, a noise you heard.

The game sees you do this. Now is it's chance.

And just as you glance back at the tv, it hits you. The big scare that you've been built up for, then brought down away from. And it grabs you in the most horrifying way a dev's twisted brain can come up with.

Welcome to Kinect.


But perhaps, it doesn't even end there. If the [Road to Fortaleza](http://www.google.ca/imgres?imgurl=http://www5.pcmag.com/media/images/348994-xbox-720-road-to-fortaleza.jpg%3Fthumb%3Dy&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2405922,00.asp&amp;h=348&amp;w=630&amp;sz=71&amp;tbnid=Lod_Hw59hOPaBM:&amp;tbnh=68&amp;tbnw=124&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__9S7blBbpIOnvXLqruSueNjfKrco=&amp;docid=Q5bVtU2-Kr3wIM&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ol67UZXnPM200QGghoGgDg&amp;ved=0CEMQ9QEwAg&amp;dur=253) is true, imagine now that you have a pair of AR glasses as well.

All of this in game madness has driven you to pause the game. you need a break. Youre sitting on the couch and calming down. Your in need of a bathroom break, the game made you nearly piss your pants.

You begin your walk to the bathroom, and as you open the door, in the AR glasses Slender is displayed in the room with you, standing in the corner. A quick flash of the character model is all it would take and you'd scream. Still caught in this game even when away from the tv, even when you thought you were safe.




This model can be applied to any horror type game. Imagine an Aliens game. A prequel to Aliens, where you play as the little girl, wandering around this complex. And the kinect detects when you are most vulnerable and begins it's assault just when you thought no face huggers could find you. 

Perhaps your playing dead space, and you use the AR glasses to view your inventory. It's set to display the info on the wall away from the tv, forcing you to look away to check your items, kinects sees you as you look back at the tv, and hits you just as your focusing back on the game.

Imagine the world of possibilities for horror games, or games not of the genre, if instead of motion controls, it uses you to control the game based on your body language, heart rate etc. Imagine that the L4D ""director"" is your subconscious, and the game uses your fear against you to make a truly unique experience.

&gt; **EDITORIAL**

*Why it’s important:* Bungie’s first big project since Halo, and it is indeed big. They’ve apparently been bouncing around the idea for this game for many, many years. It’s also multi-platform, so every gamer with a console will have an opportunity to play. 

*Best Case Scenario:* The franchise is off to a good start, making one of the best MMO and shooter hybrids. Gunplay is fun and familiar, RPG elements make each player character unique.

*Worst Case Scenario:* The game’s story, the part of the game we seem to know least about, falls flat. There isn’t enough diversity in weapons to keep things interesting. The MMO elements of happening upon other players and needing help isn’t well-balanced.

Notes:

[Official gameplay trailer, 14 minutes](http://youtu.be/gIp7vZuYzoA)

[Lengthy interview with Jason Jones, who hasn't had a public interview in 10 years. Not necessarily focused on Destiny, but certainly interesting](http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/07/bungie-co-founder-halo-and-destiny-creator-jason-jones-breaks-11-year-silence)

/r/destinythegame is the go-to place for information. A lot of good fan-theories and trailer examination.

*Discussion Prompts*

* How do you plan on playing the game? Solo; 2, 3, or 4 player co-op; or as an MMO?

* What do you think sets Destiny apart from other shooters of the same type? How do you think it will differentiate from a games like Borderlands?

* What has you excited about Destiny?

&gt; **EDITORIAL**

*Why it’s important:* Set in the past, this continues the labyrinthine story of Metal Gear Solid. It also led Microsoft’s main E3 presentation so they are getting support from the big boys. Not counting Revengeance, the last few console MGS games have been released to great acclaim.

*Best Case Scenario:* We see the same level of replayability and goofiness that comes with MGS games. The western feel of the game builds on the kind of experience that we had with Red Dead. And if I remember correctly, we’re looking at an open-world experience here.

*Worst Case Scenario:* Revengeance Round 2. Short campaign and unfamiliar story could make for a disappointing release. Don’t see that happening with the emphasis on open-world though.

I am fine with the limits on used games and stuff, because I thought it would bring the price down overall. People say they don't care about the DRM on Steam, because the games are so cheap and they have frequent sales. I would like to see Xbox One games follow. If they're just setting the price the same as Sony, and the PS4 is cheaper, why would the average person walk into a store and want to buy an Xbox One?

I think, if anything, the digital downloads should be a LOT cheaper than the discs. Not only is there no physical manufacturing or shipping costs, but because you don't have a disc, it's kind of ""stuck"" on your console (with exceptions for the ten people in your ""family"" you can ""lend"" it to, and gifting the game one time per game). The developers don't have to worry about making one copy and having it go around to a dozen people with other people making money off of reselling it. 

The only reason I still buy discs is because they're usually the same price, if not cheaper because you can get them second-hand. Even though I do like buying used games, I haven't been complaining about Xbox One's DRM because of the ""family lending"" feature, and because I *thought* the price of games would go down as a result.

Of course, we don't really know how much digital downloads will cost yet. Maybe they *will* be cheaper. Hopefully. We also don't know how third party publishers will price their games, but it seems kind of dumb that Microsoft won't budge even just a little. It just seems to me that you buy a brand new game and get all the DLC as it comes out, and sometimes you end up spending $100! "	t5_2xbci	True

1376153259.0	1k3gcs	A more in depth breakdown on Marc Whitten's Polygon interview regarding digital licenses and the 'why?' behind the new XBL Home Gold program.	Damrak	26	5	27	"http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/9/4605820/xbox-one-home-gold

This Polygon interview with Marc Whitten talks a bit about licensing and the new Home Gold system, but I feel like, in order to have a cleaner article they talked more about talking to him and what he said rather than what he was implying and what he was really getting at.

His wording is a bit confusing and kinda masks what's happening in the background so, let's do it.

**Licensing and Game Sharing**

Mr. Whitten (can I call you Marc?  Thanks Marc) is saying that, to understand how sharing of digital licenses might work, we have to understand that we have been sharing licenses for physical games all along, too.  We just haven't really thought about it that way because the game itself and the game disc (the license) were tied together.  So before when you were letting a friend borrow the game disc, he was getting the game *and* the license to play the game at the same time.

It's the reason that you couldn't install a game to the HDD and play it sans the disc.  The disc is what tells the system you have the right to play the game.  When you let your friend borrow the disc, you no longer are in possession of the license.

Now with digital licensing, it gets a bit more complicated.  There are currently two licenses: the console that it was purchased on has a license so that anyone playing on that console can play the game, and there's a license tied to the gamer tag that purchased it so that you can always play the game with your gamertag.

What this means is that the license and the game itself aren't actually tied together physically anymore.  The problem is, now that we understand this, how do we expand upon this system to offer a way to extend our license to our friends without opening up a system for abuse and causing the publishers, developers, and Microsoft themselves to lose money due to gaming of the system?

Originally, the plan was to allow you to extend your licenses to a select number of friends without having to go through anything more than defining that group.  The anti-abuse system was the 24 hour check-in.

Now that the check-in has been removed, they're trying to figure out a system in which they can allow people to share licenses, but not to just distribute their licenses to a bunch of people who want free games.

Without a mandatory check in time, it's hard to regulate.  Steam is trying to work on license sharing as well, but given their offline mode and their business model with games being offered super cheap to ensure the right people get money from every game sale, they've had a hard time figuring it out.  I say this from the position of knowing Steam has been working on this for a while now and nothing has come out regarding it.

So that's what my buddy Marc is talking about regarding the licenses.  He's expressing that, without the check-in period, it's hard to regulate a digital sharing system, so they're essentially ""back to the drawing board"" in order to get a major goal of the digital marketplace back to the public.

Speaking of gaming the system and trying to prevent it while still giving people the benefit of the intended system...

**Xbox Live Home Gold**

My boy M.W. goes on to talk about the sharing features of XBL Gold.  Again, having to do with licensing and not gaming the system, XBL Gold was started a while before digital distribution was a major contender to physical media.  The idea initially was that it was like an online pass for access to their online gaming network.  What happened, though, was that as the digital medium spread, the old model for XBL started to become antiquated, and again they ran into this problem of ""how do we allow a sharing of a license without turning the whole system we've built on its head?""  The answer is, it's incredibly hard to.  So instead of completely revamping the system that people were in the middle of during the generation, they went the band-aid method of ""let's see what we can fix until we have an opening to change the system.""

The band-aid for this system ended up being only half of the licensing that games currently have.  Instead of the license being tied to the console and the account, it was designed to only be tied to the account, so they offered a discounted package of 4 subscriptions to remedy this for multiple users instead of a console license.

The problem they ran into was gaming of the system.  People who were not in the same household and who weren't using the same console were going in together to get discounted subscriptions.  This was countered by the subsequent accounts not having certain purchasing power or settings power, as they could argue it was intended for a family so it should work like this in an effort to prevent 4 people with 4 different consoles in 4 different locations trying to all get gold for cheaper.

Now that there is a new generation about to start, they have seen an opportunity to change the system around and design the new console with the same licensing powers that they have seen work with digital content.  The license is going to be on both the console and the account!  This is a move forward for XBL Gold, but it is sure to upset those people benefiting from the family plan at current.

They can't change the way it currently operates on the 360 since Gold is now going to be a shared system across consoles... so they are giving away a year of XBL gold, split amongst the 4 accounts, to anyone who had a family plan, and are lifting the restrictions of the child accounts.

Again, this is going to make people upset, but what could they do?  Abandon any unification they are trying to make to make people happy, while screwing themselves in the long run by having Gold act differently depending on the console?  They would open themselves up to a family pack giving out 4 licenses for 4 total consoles instead of just 4 accounts if those 4 accounts under a family plan were to all upgrade to an XB1.  That would mean that up to 20 people could have a year of XBL Gold for $100.  Or $5 each.  The gaming potential is staggering.  Something had to happen to allow the new, better sharing system to exist on the XB1.  It just so happens to cause some pain to the people who were benefiting, either legitimately or illegitimately, with the family pack.  Their solution was to offer a promotional period of free XBL Gold to compensate the change.  A change that needed to happen.

tl;dr - M-Slice Whitten is talking about expanding digital licensing on games to allow sharing them without gaming and without a mandatory check in period.  He also talks about how XBL Gold is now evolving to share the licensing structure of digital content and how it's necessary to cut off family accounts."	t5_2xbci	True

I missed out on this feature, however it seems like something that made watching movies fun. However I was thinking of what could maybe take it a step further. 

If the xbox dev that did the AMA was a lying OP then the family plan was to share full access to games(minus no more than one at a time and whatnot) and that would be cool. What if they did this for movies as well. If you decide or your friend or brother that is on your family sharing plan buys a movie all the people on the plan can watch the movie (in this view as well with the whole in a movie theater like view)

However there has to be a trade off. Maybe the original buyer of the movie has to pay if more than say 4? people were watching the movie at his house he had to pay maybe a dollar or two more. The ~~evil eye of Sauron~~ kinect could tell that. (however it wouldn't count people if kinect recognizes a person as a gamertag tagged to your family plan) Also any people on your family plan has to pay a couple bucks if more than two people on their end are watching the movie as well?

What are your thoughts. I personally would do that. Be able to watch movie together with a person across country."	t5_2xbci	True

Could the same work for the Xbox One? 

I'd say price it at 299$ and sign up for xbox live for 2 years at 16$ a month. That isn't too large of a cost per month and would end up with the final amount paid for the console being 683$.

That seems expensive, but when you buy a single console at 500 and then buy two years of gold it would be 620$ So microsoft would end up making 63$ extra on the console and it would be much easier to pay for as a consumer.

A 299$ upfront price would compete with the much cheaper Wii U and would encourage people to buy an xbox one over a ps4.

Not only that, but it would encourage people to buy new consoles rather than used ones, giving microsoft more money overall. If it sold well, that would be a higher install base for games as well.

I think they could really do well if they did that. "	t5_2xbci	True

I'm sure that you guys didn't think of others when you bought your smartphone.

Yeah, I know that it seems MS doesn't give two shits about the community and Sony is the second coming of Christ, but in reality they're borh in it for the money. If you actually think that either company cares for you, you're wrong. If you've been following the consoles, you would know that BOTH consoles are letting publishers decide if games can be resold. Sony wants money, as does MS. Both companies have had incidents that justify their ""care"" for the consumer.

1371402629.0	1ggnhb	Xbox One and Rentals: How I would like it to work	Sjetware	36	15	11	"I don't know how many of you also subscribe to GameFly like myself - I find it a very good service and a much valued addition to my entertainment options. However, there are a couple of drawbacks to the service that I think Microsoft could capitalize on with the Xbox One architecture and make a very attractive choice for gamers. 


Ideally, I would propose offering an Xbox One Gold + Rentals subscription level, such that in addition to your gold membership, you have the option to ""rent"" any title on the console. Considering the license mechanics we know about, this should be easy enough for microsoft to do. Once you choose to ""rent"" a title, you gain a temporary license to the game and are allowed to digitally download that title (but no other titles until you ""checkin"" your current rental) Once you are done, you ""checkin"" the title, and the license is revoked by the cloud. 

Alternatively, you could offer a timeboxed rental where the cloud automatically revokes the license after the rental period elapses, similar to how Xbox Video revokes movie rentals.

In order to prevent cannibalizing sales, games only become available to ""rent"" one to two months after release (when most sales occur). Microsoft kicks back a portion of rental fees to the publisher / developer for each game rented in order to offset potential loss in revenue for people who simply wait for releases.

This functions very similarly to GameFly, except that there is no longer any delay in shipping the title to you, there is no shortage of physical media forcing you to get a different game, and there is no worry about getting charged for damaged disks / late returns. Currently, you currently cannot rent xbox live arcade games, only physical releases. With this system, you could rent the new generation equivalents of Bastion or Defense Grid and play those, unlike what is currently available. 

Microsoft, please implement this and I will send you lots of money."	t5_2xbci	True

(xpost from r/gaming)	Nazte	68	45	43	"So first off let me clarify that I am getting both consoles, potentially both on their launch days, so I will be lucky enough to enjoy the fruits of both systems and yippy that's great. I am a long time Sony fan, and have never owned an Xbox 360 (although I do still plan on buying one). I told myself before all of this hype and announcements that I was going to buy whatever Microsoft put out next, because I was so impressed with how well the Xbox 360 turned out over years of them improving it. Then there was E3, and the bombs dropped. At first I was feeling just the same as most of you; betrayed, disappointed, and sure to hell that I was not going to support this crazy Nazi-box that Microsoft was releasing. I fed right into the hivemind, right into all of the negative hype and memes and brainwashing that has been going on all over the internet. But then I sat down and really thought about it, and was also really excited to learn about the details outlined [here](http://www.neowin.net/news/anonymous-xbox-engineer-explains-drm-and-microsofts-xbox-one-intentions). Forgive me if my formatting sucks, as I never post anything more than comments on reddit, but this is something I felt I really have to share and it's worth the effort. 

* Let me just get out of the way that I have and most likely always will have a stable internet connection at home as well as at work, so the online check-in function does not hinder me in any way. I truly feel for anyone who this does effect, that sucks and there's really no answer or solution anyone can give at this time to those people except to maybe use a cellphone to tether a brief connection long enough to perform the check-in process.

* To be honest, when you really look into the functionality of Game Sharing and the digital format of the Xbox One, it ends up being exactly like sharing and trading games in real life only better. This time around people like me, and I'm sure like many of you, who have even more friends in different cities or countries will be able to freely share games with them, and I believe even still play the very games that you Shared; an option impossible on a physical disc based format. 
* Do I really have to remind Reddit how much the used games industry sucks, and how you get completely ripped off trading in your titles at retail stores like GameStop? I mean come on now, you people are focusing on the beauty of the pricing on used titles, not how much it sucks to be the one trading the game in for next to nothing. 
* Which brings me to this, as stated in the first article linked above, that by having these games on a digital format and publishers not having to make a fuss out of GameStop making huge profits off of secondary sales of their products, these companies will be able to price their games at their true value, hopefully between $5-$30 instead of the industry standard of $60 right now. Now if we don't see this value on the consumer side in the future, it's true we are definitely being exploited by massive amounts of greed.

* One of my biggest grievances with Xbox One was the required install of a Blu-Ray based disc, onto a little baby 500GB HDD. Then I learned [here](http://www.geek.com/games/xbox-one-hard-drive-cant-be-replaced-but-external-storage-supported-1556044/) that there is a dedicated USB 3.0 input on the back of the Xbox One that will allow you to attach any external hard drive that you please, and this external drive can hold any data that the internal drive can, meaning you can store all of your games, music, movies, etc. on a high capacity external drive and your storage worries are completely over. 

The only issues I am finally left with are the facts that I am excited about more exclusives on the Sony side than Xbox, and that I am not entirely excited about Kinect 2 being a mandatory part of the console functioning. I am definitely not one of the Orwell-screaming conspiracy folk who believe Microsoft and the government are just so damn interested in their regular, boring lives, I just am not a huge fan of what they did with it in the past as far as games and functions go. I am hopeful however that they're seriously going to deliver me a Minority Report-style experience while commanding my tv, movies, music and games all together at once from the same machine while I sit my lazy ass right there on the couch. Gone are the days of disc-swapping, or searching for different controllers/remotes to perform different functions between entertainment devices. I just preordered my Day One Edition Xbox One on Amazon and I couldn't be more proud of it. I will also be buying a Playstation 4, as I need some Infamous, Killzone, The Order and Planetside 2 in my life. I'm excited to purchase a Live Gold account and buy all of my multiplatform titles on the Xbox One to hopefully enjoy the more robust online experience alongside all of the other Live users out there. Overall, I'm just really fucking excited for this new generation of gaming and I hopefully wish you all do your own research and thinking about which system is really the future device for you, or perhaps just be like me and buy both them bitches! Thanks for reading this to anyone who does, and thanks for all the laughs Reddit. 



Also please feel free to comment on any issues I didn't bring up here as I'd love to discuss them with all of you. 

EDIT: Another thing I wanted to address was Microsoft's online capacity in terms of the Xbox One versus the 360. For the 360, Microsoft had/has roughly 15,000 servers to handle Xbox Live operations and multiplayer gaming. Coming into the Xbox One they have upped that number to 300,000 servers. There are also rumors that every major multiplayer title will have dedicated servers assigned to them. So also gone are the days of lagging out and reconnecting because of some guy hosting a game on a shitty connection."	t5_2xbci	True
1371039577.0	1g6vzx	I like Xbox One's used games policy.	lolJez	147	123	207	"Reason being, that the used games market doesn't serve to further the quality of games. Retailers are basically profiteering from the accomplishments of others by reselling the same disk over and over, retailers are not philanthropists.

Microsoft are moving the industry towards a digital model, where 100% of profits go back into the industry, to be reinvested in the future of video games. 

Xbox One has cloud computing, which they have demo'd rendering calculations for the entire solar system, including 40000 asteroids, velocities, collisions, all rendered remotely to take the load off the Xbox itself. It has an intensely responsive and upgraded kinect, which Gizmodo reported is essentially like having extra buttons on your gamepad, its that accurate. Think of selecting spells from a visual menu on screen rather than going through a huge scrolled list in Skyrim. Smartglass as well.

All those features (and the features on the PS4 for that matter) come from the profits of licensing video games, not from the profits of retailers. Ensuring developers can compete for the talent to develop those consoles, those games, comes from the profits of the video games industry.

Sure, some people apparently can't afford games brand new, but to those people I say wait a few months, Tomb Raider in the UK is 50% cheaper than it was at release, after just a few months. Used games are negligibly cheaper than buying new around release time anyway. I simply don't get the uproar about it, especially a few of my friends who don't even buy used games, seemingly getting angry about it on others behalf. 

TL;DR - I would rather see 100% of the profits go back into the video games industry, rather than the pointless used games retail industry, which is already on its knees (GAME, HMV, Virgin Megastores, all going bust in the UK).

&gt; **EDITORIAL**

*Why it’s important:* This is the game that will reach the widest audience possible and will be released on every platform imaginable, from iOS to PS2 (yes, they have a PS2 version being released). Fifa 13 went over 14 million sales as of May of this year with a release date of September 2012.

*Worth noting:* Next-gen consoles will be treated to the Ignite Engine which will become the EA Sports standard, much like Frostbite will be used for most every other EA game.

Ultimate Team mode is also back this year, which is similar to Madden NFL’s fantasy draft. Although the mode can be played freely, additional players can be purchased with real money through unlocking packs.

1375366119.0	1jht6h	Xbox One App Discussion	Angry_Gnome	27	4	41	"Now that we know that the Xbox One will have a full fledged App Store similar to the Windows 8 store we should start talking about what kind of non-gaming apps we would like to see on the system. These apps should leverage both the incredible power of the Kinect 2.0 and the Xbox One’s internals. The developers of these apps must take care to design the apps with the living room in mind rather than just be copies of phone and tablet apps. Here are a couple of ideas that could help get this conversation started:

**Weather Apps**: How cool would it be to find out the weather from the dashboard of the Xbox One? You could even ask Kinect what the weather is and it could direct you to this specific weather app.

**Movies App:** Have you ever been sitting in the living room talking about going to see a movie with friends but have no idea what is playing around you? With the Xbox One you could simply look at the movie app to see local listings or even ask the Kinect to purchase tickets for you!

**News Apps:** These apps could be designed for reading news on a big screen TV. Similar to Flipboard they could be very visual with plenty of pictures and video to make the news experience interactive and enjoyable in the living room.

**Music Apps:** What if you could have Spotify on your Xbox One? You could queue up your favorite playlist in the background while playing a multiplayer game of Battlefield 4.

**Business and Office Apps**: Because Microsoft is marketing that the Xbox One could be used in a business setting it makes sense that the full office suite should work on the system. Imagine giving a powerpoint presentation and swiping through the slides using kinect. The effect could be a very immersive and simple way to give presentations.

**Smart Home Apps**: What if you could ask your Kinect to turn off the lights in your living room or to turn up the temperature? With smart home apps like WeMo or Nest on the Xbox One we could control our entire house all from the comfort of a couch.

**Social Media Apps:** Facebook and Twitter are no brainers, but imagine if we could capture a Vine from the Kinect in our living room. These apps would need to be designed from the ground up for the living room and should not just be simple web apps.

Really the possibilities are endless for apps that people can make on the Xbox One. I think the mandatory Kinect on every system will ensure that these apps are designed with the living room in mind and not be just simple web apps. I think that this will propel the Xbox to be the first class system for app development, and subjugate the PS4 to have second class app experiences because they do not all have the Kinect. What are your thoughts on the subject?

**TLDR: Non-gaming Apps on the Xbox One are going to be amazing, and will truly change the connected living room experience.**

&gt; **EDITORIAL**

*Why it’s important:* After being considered vaporware as Final Fantasy XIII Versus, Final Fantasy XV is revealed at the PS4 E3 event. Soon after it is announced that it will be multi-platform. The game is based off of the [crystal mythology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabula_Nova_Crystallis) which apparently started around FFXIII. I suggest anyone who’s interested read the development section of the [wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XV) for a good idea on what’s been happening behind the scenes.

And from the comments on that article:


""*Ok, so it's now the middle of February and GameStop still hasn't fullfilled it's preorders. In fact, i was told on the phone today that I will not get mine for 5 to 6 weeks.*""


Don't believe any guarantee you will receive your console on or anywhere near launch day at this point. History is constantly repeating itself. Gamestop is notorious for overselling and overpromising. Considering they require a huge deposit, this is ridiculous. I would go with the Microsoft store, or Amazon, where you don't need a deposit.

I for one, have no reason to believe the Kinect will be ""watching and listening"". The amount of server space, as large as it may be, couldn't handle the mass recordings of 1080p from millions of people each day. People have been using headsets over gaming networks but that doesn't phase them. But once a camera is in place, all he all breaks lose. All this ""invasion of privacy"" bullshit. I have a kinect now, I've used it many times and love it. I've even turned if completely off. I've done my fare share of personal things in front of it and I don't see videos of ms poppin up everywhere. Granted, I'm not making bombs while I'm gaming or saying the nicest of things. But this ridiculous nonsense needs to be put to rest. If people can say anything over the internet, on console networks, etc..., and nothing has come of it, why is this such an ""intrusion"" on privacy?

 I for one fully support the Kinect 2.0. The whole concept of it allow game developers to add a whole new aspect of it. I've mentioned it before and I'll use the example again; if youre playing Dead Rising 3 and reach for a cup on your coffee table, you might end up knocking it over making a ton of noise in the process. The kinect translates that into the game and will cause zombies to see your position. To me that immerses the gamer even more. But that's just one of MANY examples

I just hope people can further explain peoples paranoia and how they can look past the Kinect as a simple camera. How can people overcome this silly fear of always being watched when they simply aren't. They make themselves look like basement dwelling conspiracy theorists. Look at the kinect for its capabilities and its potential to further expand gaming experiences.

As far as I can tell, the Wii actually 'won' the war. Doesn't seem to have helped them much this time though, so what did they win? 

War is completely the wrong word and for some reason it bugs me when I see it. If it was actually a war, then Nintendo would have destroyed MS and Sony and there would be no One or PS4. 

What's important is not winning or losing, the only thing that's important is not messing things up like Sega did with the Dreamcast!

&gt; **EDITORIAL**

*Why it’s important:* Before you scoff, this stuff is crack for any kid under the age of 13. You place your IRL action figure onto a pedestal that plugs into the console and the figure shows up on screen.

The first game was released in 2011 and Activision’s marketing has been all about shoving these toys in kids’ faces. I remember seeing coupons around Black Friday for ‘free figures’, and it really helps that the toys are forwards compatible, in that you can use your old figures for new games. It’s getting positive reviews almost across the board as well.

Oh, and the game used the Spyro brand for the first game. Not really sure if they’re really pushing that aspect anymore though.

*What could get out of hand:* Go to ebay and type in “skylanders lot” and you can see why having a child with an addictive personality could get out of hand.

*Discussion Prompts*

* Have you witnessed any of the Skylanders craze? Have you been sucked in yourself?

* If you’ve seen kids play with them, do you think they play the game more or with the action figures more?

* What would the Skylanders series have to do in order to get you to buy it?

1374712367.0	1iztl9	"An ""Achievement junkies"" question about the X1's new achievement system."	AncientApple	23	4	21	"Just like many of you I'm an achievement whore. The challenge of getting that specific achievement or 100%ing a game feels very satisfying, coming from that competitive edge in me. 

My only problem is with the current achievement system. Pretty much all games - now a days - come with DLC post release and with DLC comes achievements. The current achievement system does not separate DLC achievements from the game's default achievements but instead it mangles them in this never ending list of untitled, uncategorized achievements, which, as an achievement whore, is a kind of upsetting. That one time I 100%'d Skyrim's achievements was awesome, but the game only stayed on the ""completed"" list of games for a short while. Once the DLC came out the game disappeared from that list and went back to my backlog of NOT completed games. To that I was upset because it was as if all my hard work had been gone. 

The trophy is not in the display case anymore guys.

With that said, I'm really really hoping that the new achievement system separates the game's default achievements, from the game's future DLC and events achievements.  Meaning I hope additional achievements won't affect the game from being on that ohh soo satisfying completed games display list.

What are your guy's opinions/ questions/ concerns on this or the new achievement system in general?

VoodooJenkins	25	5	58	I Currently have the Nexus 7 but realized that Smart Glass is optimized for The Surface and Ipad. I was really impressed with the tablet integration with games like Project Spark, Battlefield 4, and Dead Rising 3 (All Games I'm getting at launch) and I love watching Game of Thrones with Smart Glass.

1372263329.0	1h465c	What do we know about the Universal Remote possibilities of the XBoxOne?	Olgaar	31	12	21	"I understand the XBoxOne will ship with an IR blaster in order to control cable boxes.  I, like many, don't subscribe to cable so that feature hadn't interested me.  Until I considered whether or not that IR Blaster will used to control OTHER devices in my hometheater.  Wouldn't it be cool to not only say, **""XBox On.""**

But also, **""XBox Turn On TV.""**

And also, **""XBox Change TV Input.""**

Even, **""XBox Volume Down.""**

If you own a WiiU you know how surprisingly convenient it is to have many of these functions built in to the console.  Sadly, the Nintendo solution is limited.  I can't control volume to my hometheater speakers--only the volume of built-in TV speakers.  But how amazing would it if MS implemented IR codes for multiple devices (or even better allowed US to program the codes).  Heck, if this was done right, I could be playing on my WiiU, and say, ""XBox, Volume Down"" if Mario was getting a little too loud!"	t5_2xbci	True

That said, the DAY ONE branding on the controller, smack dab in the center, doesn't look that awesome. 

Is there branding on the console itself as well?

Anyone not really feeling having DAY ONE right in the center of your brand new controller?
