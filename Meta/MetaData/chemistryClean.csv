1355895364.0	153fgl	Qualitative analysis in every day life!	SamnitesFall	336	30	43	"An hour ago, I turned on my gas stove and noted that the flames were burning a distinct shade of orange.  Thinking it was just a result of impurities on the burner, I tried another one.  Orange.

Weird.  Let's turn on the oven and check the flames.

Orange.  Water heater?  Orange.  Gas logs?  Orange.

Uh oh.  Looks like we have something wrong with our gas supply.  Turn off the heaters and all sources of gas, and call the gas company, stat.

But wait a minute.  I've been smelling a faint, dusty - well, I almost wouldn't even call it a scent.  It's more like a sensation.  Very faint.  Like inhaling deeply on  a dry, dusty day.

Hmmm...let's try something else.  So I grabbed a propane torch, fueled by a screw-on can of propane.  Light it up and BAM.

Orange.

Oh shit, it's something in the *air*.

Now I get really concerned and go open the house up and wake up my wife, and get ready to get my two-year-old out of the house.

I walk into his room and it's incredibly foggy.  Wait.  That can't be right!  The humidifier in his room is running full-blast (from where he cranked up the dial on the way to bed.  What can I say?  Toddlers.) and pumping out TONS of mist.  But it's not settling!  It looks like the inside of a ping pong ball in there.  It's like a foggy night, right in my son's bedroom.  Creepy.  A little eerie, actually.

By this time, my wife is up and kind of freaking out.  I ask her if she did anything, and she says yes, she dumped two tablespoons of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, duh) into the humidifier.

A light went on in my head.  That was SODIUM orange.  Very distinctive.  The baking soda neatly explained the strange smell, the foggy baby room, and the orange flames.

The humidifier is one of those ultrasonic jobbies that creates a fine mist via very high frequency vibrations in the water.  It was also throwing (probably incompletely-dissolved) baking soda particles out as well.  The very high humidity in my son's room, along with the lots of condensation nuclei (tiny particles of bicarb) resulted in fog.  The cause of the dusty smell is now obvious.  And the orange flame was nothing more than the classic sodium-in-a-bunsen-burner flame test.

Wow.  Weird night.  I turned off the humidifier, opened up the house, turned on all the exhaust fans in the place, and double checked sodium bicarbonate inhalation toxicity (there is none, really), and everybody went to bed.

The gas company tech thought I was insane until I showed him, walking the propane torch in and out of the house, watching the flame change color instantly.

It's a little cold in here now, but the gas burner is already going back to normal.

Wouldn't my old qualitative analysis prof be proud?  :)

1355391328.0	14s1ai	I am becoming more and more disappointed with the general public...	pipette_on	238	39	269	"Several people have already brought to attention the general public's fear of chemicals and the pushing of companies like [Jamba Juice](http://blog.chembark.com/2012/08/23/jamba-juice-hates-chemistry/) to have anti-chemical/chemistry products, but it just amazes me how so many people buy into this notion that ""chemicals are big, bad and scary"".  For instance, I can understand how people who have only taken high-school level chemistry classes 30 years ago may not be educated in what chemicals are, but I was just browsing pinterest and was absolutely stunned.  You see I am a biochemistry undergrad and one of my good friends who is a biology undergrad (physio concentration) pinned [this](http://i.imgur.com/psPUp.png).  

Notice the ""no chemical"" remark.  Now I understand that when you repin something, the original description stays unless you change it, so I messaged her to just kind of bust her chops about the whole comment, just joking around, when she responds about how no, **all** chemicals are bad and she added that description.  Okay, this is supposed to be a competent person majoring in the sciences who should know a bit about chemistry and what chemicals actually are.  It just amazes me how she doesn't comprehend that baking soda and lemon juice are chemicals.  I mean, my god, baking soda is pure sodium bicarbonate, pretty ""chemical"" sounding to me.

Sorry about the rant, or if this isn't the entirely appropriate subreddit to post to.  I am just feeling at a loss as to how so many people are ignorant to the basic world around them.

**Edit:** Wow... I sure did not expect this thread to take off like this.  The discussion on here is great, I have definitely learned some new things and I appreciate the educated and well thought out replies haha."	t5_2qhf9	True

It is about filling balloons with a LOT helium and letting the up them to the stratosphere, and everyone could connect to the internet worldwide. This is a nice idea, but:

The problem is that we have a massive shortage of helium (http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/a-ballooning-problem-the-great-helium-shortage-8439108.html), so I am surprised that Google found that this would be the best idea to get the balloons up there. 

Since we have specific applications where the remaining helium is much more important (cryogenic technologies) and couldn't be replaced with hydrogen, I would like to know that is there anyone that could help to suggest these thing to Google, since if they will start this project with hundreds of balloons, the price of the helium will go up right to the stratosphere."	t5_2qhf9	True

I'm open to incorporate other sources that you like. I am fully aware that most redditors hate bots. However, most redditors also hate not having enough content in their reddits too. If you don't like what I automatically submit, vote it down maliciously and with much prejudice. If you like it, vote it up. 

However, if you generally just dislike the concept of a bot let me know and I'll sadly turn myself off and cease to exist if the majority hates me.

Most importantly leave a comment so I know how everyone feels on this issue.

Best,

You can still see that these cylinders came from [german companies](http://i.imgur.com/ZuNEk.jpg).

He is especially bummed because the question he missed was ""how many valence electrons does a Hydrogen atom have?"" In his haste to complete the test, he had answered 2.

Depressed and despairing, he takes a walk alone along a beach, and is lost in thought when he trips on a metal object in the sand. Picking it up, he finds it to be a brass oil lamp, and as his fingers brush the surface a genie suddenly appears! The genie thunders, ""I can grant you any one wish, but you must answer now. What do you desire?"" The student immediately replies, ""I wish I had gotten that question right,"" and the universe explodes."	t5_2qhf9	True

I of course tried it and did a few tests.

After drinking the warm and cold coca cola I did some blind tests with drinks. I tried vodka and water, the vodka went down scary easily, but I could hint the taste.

I tried some cheeses to compare, but did not notice much taste there, just cardboard like taste.

A few hours later I was going to eat some chips but could not taste them at all! So I guess I'm eating all the disguisting things in my cupboard tonight!

1370474111.0	1fr63y	Greetings r/chemistry. I am a 2010 Chemistry PhD graduate who has been working in industry for 3 years. AMA.	pushinarrows	144	22	244	"I graduated in 2010 from the UMN. My studies were in Physical Chemistry, Synthetic, and Instrumentation. I have been working for a Fortune 100 company doing Environmental Analytical Chemistry for the years since my graduation. 

For those of you wondering, Environmental Anaytical Chemistry is the detection, isolation, and quantification of chemicals present naturally or unnatural in the environment. I develop and validate methods for the detection of these chemicals with GC, GC-MS/MS, LC, and LC-MS/MS equipment. This work is also highly regulated by the US government and numerous other governments around the world. 

I though I would lend my knowledge to anyone wanting to know about getting a job in the current economy, going to graduate school and wanting to know about life there, or to anyone wanting to know how to get into graduate school, i.e. what classes you should take, internships, and research as an undergrad.  

Also, feel free to ask me anything about my work or what I did in graduate school to get to where I am now. I will be able to answer most things, but there are questions about my job which I will not be able to answer. For example: What new horrid compounds is your company developing to dump into the environment? 

EDIT: 12:11 am EST. I am going to bed. Keep posting and I will try to get to more questions tomorrow as I have time throughout the day. 

EDIT 2: Unfortunately work calls. Keep posting questions and I will try to get to the remainder when my lunch break comes around. 

Edit 3: Lunch is over. I will keep answering questions as long as there is interest. Right now, however, I must return to work. 

Edit 4: Today will be my last day on this thread. It has been a lot of fun, but it's Friday and I am going out this weekend. "	t5_2qhf9	True

1336399947.0	tb6as	I must be special. Just got the email I have been waiting for all my life. The ACS has selected me.	paiute	136	18	43	"&gt;Dear paiute,
&gt;
&gt;I am happy to invite you to become a member of the American Chemical Society. Each year we compile a roster of likely candidates for ACS membership and your name has been included on this year's list. Please accept this invitation and find out how ACS can help advance your professional career. By becoming a member, you're given the opportunity to explore your career further by taking advantage of the professional benefits we provide.  

Wow. I am overwhelmed. You mean it only takes three or four decades of actually working at the profession before the ACS deigns to put me on the holy roster?  

&gt;Join ACS by May 21, 2012 and you'll receive a complimentary ACS Periodic Table of
&gt;the Elements Chart with your paid membership as a token of our thanks.

In return for my $148 per year I get a periodic chart? What promotional genius thought that one up?

&gt;ACS membership provides you with access to the latest technology including ACS' own online professional networking tool, the ACS Network.

Yeah, I can image that the ACS Network is a hotbed of useful information.  

&gt;Become an ACS member today and save on the following benefits:
&gt;
&gt;	•	Skills and Knowledge Development with online courses presented by the ACS Center for Professional Development.

Yes, I want to save a few percent off of your overpriced web offerings. Then I would be overpaying by only ten or twentyfold. 

&gt;	•	Career Resources including expert guidance on job search strategies, interviewing tips, resume writing, salary negotiation techniques and opportunities to interview with employers at Career Fairs at ACS national meetings.  

You must have totally overhauled that system since the days when I was actually looking for a job and could have used the help, because then the ACS did approximately zero for me. In fact, I got the distinct impression then that the ACS existed primarily to serve the chemical industry, not its workers like me.  

&gt;	•	Networking Opportunities with ACS members and other chemical professionals from around the globe.

Really? Like LinkedIn or Facebook but with fewer members and higher fees?  

&gt;Become a member of ACS by May 21, 2012 and we'll show our appreciation by
&gt;sending you a complimentary Periodic Table of the Elements chart.

You already said that. Perhaps you could fire one of your grossly overpaid executives and hire some liberal arts graduate to proofread your emails.    

&gt;Don't miss out on the many benefits of being a member of ACS.
&gt;Take control of your professional career and join ACS today! 

Funny, I thought I took control of my professional career when I found myself a job and actually, you know, made it a career.  

&gt;Sincerely, 
&gt;
&gt;Debora J. Fillinich
&gt;Division of Membership &amp; Scientific Advancement 
&gt;American Chemical Society

This ubiquitous piece of software works just fine when I am preparing handouts, tests, or quizzes which have only simple, clean organic structures in them. However, when doing grant and research work I often have to do mind-bogglingly complex tasks like ""paste in an image"" or ""draw a cartoon of a heterogenous catalyst.""

Chemdraw always fails at this. It refuses to render the image properly into a TIFF or JPG, it crashes Word on trying to embed as an object, it sneakily changes color renderings on you when you change unrelated settings. PDF printers throw up their hands in exasperation when asked to handle Chemdraw structures. 

The last straw was when my home version suddenly decided that my institutional subscription had to be renewed. I dutifully went through the school website, filled out the form for the download, was forced to register for Perkin Elmer's website for some damn reason, and finally got the registration code emailed to me.

Entering the code produced a long, complex error message in computerspeak that my English-parsing brain refuses to remember. That's right, I was unable to register my legally acquired product which my institution pays thousands of dollars for. The unregistered product was completely unable to interact with MS Word, resulting in me giving up, saving the figure as-is in JPG format, and swearing the above oath.

Go to Hell, Chemdraw. I'm done with you.

So, rant over; now, what open source or *reliable* for-pay software do y'all use for chemical and scientific drawing? I need the ability to produce high-quality images suitable for publishing.

I am a Aldrich chemistry sales rep and I am looking to gain some insight into how chemists perceive Aldrich as a chemistry supplier. Candid feedback is welcome. I will also answer any questions you have for me. 

Thanks for your help! 

**EDIT:** Thank you for all of the great responses. I will be more than happy to pass along your feedback to our marketing team. 

One of the common themes here seem to be shipping. There are a couple of things that play into this. First, let me say that this is an issue that we are currently working to address, because we have heard much of the same feedback from customers. 

Aldrich is a real stickler when it comes to compliance, customs, importation, etc. Now I realize that most of you are probably talking about common chemicals, building blocks you are ordering on a daily basis.. however, there is an unbelievable amount of regulations when it comes to shipping chemicals -- even more so recently. I think it also depends where you ordering from. People on the west coast tend to get hit harder with handling fees because of the chemicals that are required to travel by truck. We are currently evaluating ideas for local warehousing in CA to help mitigate these costs. 
Our first step is to evaluate our internal costs. A secondary approach is of course working out contracts with individual institutions and accounts. 

**EDIT 2:** Thank you all so much for your honesty, and feedback. I will definitely be sharing these points of interest with some of my superiors. I obviously cannot promise anything, but I know that feedback from chemists like yourselves is exactly what we are looking for. 

I will be following this  post for days to come and responding to feedback, questions as best as I can, so keep them coming if you have them. 

Again, I really appreciate it! "	t5_2qhf9	True

Keep in mind, I had never met her before. She got pretty offended and that's where things stopped. Now honestly, I don't regret asking her that, I care more about my health than getting some anon sex. To me the fact that she got offended was a red flag that shit wasn't alright down there, or at the very least, I had somehow made her really uncomfortable. Maybe she wasn't comfortable with being eaten out, though she didn't say it.  I felt bad over the possibility that I had hurt her confidence but didn't get much chance to explain myself as she asked me to leave, which she was polite about. My question sexxit is this, what kind of tact do you use when inquiring on sexual health? How could I have done it differently, or did I just manage to avoid putting my dick in crazy.  Also, if it's of any contextual importance, I haven't been getting laid for very long.

Edit: ok, so the general consensus seems to be in favor of asking, but preferably before things heat up. Also avoid placing too much pressure on the other, if it can be avoided. Thanks sexxit, this is helpful.

http://www.onlineschools.org/blog/everything-fast-food/

While I am not particularly fond of fast food some of this info graphic is probably legitimate, about half way down is one of the worst instances of chemophobia that I've ever seen.

The milkshake ""contains over 50 different chemicals"". When are people going to realize that chemicals are not inherently bad. I'm a chemical, you're a chemical, and yes, your milkshake is made of chemicals. In fact, I would be willing to bed that it's made of orders of magnitude more than 50 different chemicals.

Now, some specific chemicals that they point out (exclusively because of their evil sounding names):

Diacetyl -- ""Adds ""buttery taste"""". That phrasing is specifically meant to make it seem artificial. They don't mention that the reason it adds a buttery taste is that it is in butter. Real, natural cow butter. I don't hear anyone crying fowl over that...

Sodium Phosphate -- Basically just a pH buffer. They probably just use it to keep things at the right level of acidity. It couldn't be less bad for you. Probably used in detergents for the same reason. Fact that it is in a detergent, does not mean it is the active ingredient in the detergent.

Titanium Dioxide -- Potentially harmful. If inhaled. In large quantities. I think that if you inhales large quantities of fat-free ranch dressing, titanium dioxide would be low on your list of problems. Titanium dioxide is a food coloring. That's why it's in sunscreen. That's also why it's added to almost all commercially produced skim milk.

Dimethylpolysiloxane -- If someone asked me to assemble a list of chemicals that wouldn't hurt you, this would be near the top. There is a reason that breast implants are made of silicon polymers.

Azodicarbonamide -- OK, fine. I wouldn't want to eat this one.

Final comment: ""Studies revealed 50% of fountain drink dispensers were contaminated with fecal bacteria."" According to myth busters, another sure fire way to find fecal bacteria is to check your tooth brush.

I'm here to tell you, that yes, there are jobs out there. Maybe not the one you thought you were going to get, however, we are not all so lucky to get THE job that we will stay in for the rest of our career. I will try to give my advice in how to get a job in the science field, since I didn't see a guide on here. (doing a quick search of 2 minutes and reading all the same stuff of asking where or what should someone do) 


Exclude those going into College/First Year Students:

Now first off, those going into college asking questions, just take a few classes in the degree you picked first. College is an experience that can take up to 7 years (a great experience mind you). Yes, I have known people who have been in college for 7 years, however since they were undecided for such a long time, they either got a general science degree or a dual degree (both work to benefit in their own way). That is why I wont tell you what you should do. This is for those who have any specific type of chemistry degree. 


Include some Freshmen/Sophomores and a must read for Juniors/Seniors:

Ask to do research with a professor. If they say no, ask another one. If people still say no, ask to help out in the lab. If they still happen say no, learn to cook for a semester. Ask again and again and again, until you are able to get into the lab. This may mean you'll work for free; however the end will justify your means of getting that experience. Intern as much as possible; whether its in industry or academia, it is a must. Do not think that getting the degree with little/no work experience will get you anything. Beg for science sake. This also helps if you are going into further education (applying for grad school if you so choose).  


Chemistry:

This field includes and is not limited to all the degrees that state the word chemistry in the title with the exception of CHEMICAL ENGINEERING. This is a totally different subject matter. Plus, chem engineers get a lot of benefits that chemists don't; starting pay is drastically different and the work place is drastically different. Two pieces of advice for CHEM ENGINEERS: Get an internship and you don't need to further your education, you get paid well enough getting your undergrad alone (just look up the differences in average pay). 


What type of degree should I get? 

Associates degrees (2 years) are able to be more hire-able than BS/BA's in a technician or contract position. The company knows you will stay with them for at least 6 months to at most 2 years (contract) and 5 years full time non-contract. The time spent here will decide if you like repetitive tasks or not (I mean really really repetitive) thus you may go back to school or do part time schooling to get a BS/BA to get a better less repetitive job function. (Pay $12-25 an hour possible benefits and recruiting costs) FYI Most jobs are repetitive especially in chemistry 


BA/BS - almost no difference with one exception: 

**If you want to get a PhD get a BS.** That is the only exception. You can still get a higher education with a BA, but you'll need the experience. That being said, **You do not need to get your masters if you want higher education.** You can go straight for your PhD if you so choose after your undergrad. This still requires the lab experience along with publishing papers. My GF will be heading to grad school in the fall. She and others alike who applied to good chemistry/biochemistry schools all had published papers. Most were first authors or had their names in them. Yes, as an undergrad you too can get published! It requires you to talk with your professor and getting into those projects and putting in the time. If you don't like it, then full time PhD and master programs are not for you.  


With a BA or BS + the small amount of experience you have in academic lab work you can apply anywhere lab technicians/chemists/scientist/contract job postings are available. (If I can, I will talk more about applying below) Note: **Your first job will likely not be something you like.** You are doing it because you know what lies ahead or you really hate your boss. (Pay $14-25 an hour OR $30-60 a year) Notice with pay its much wider, this is due to the experience and type of job you will have. 


I cannot stress enough how getting the academic lab experience is for you to get the job. Do not think that your lab for credits will automatically mean experience, it does not and will not. 


Applying for jobs

* Start applying 3 months before graduation. The hiring/interview process takes a long time, do not wait for your degree, wait for their replies. 

* Join LinkedIn (FYI if you have it already change your password) start looking up company names and put your resume on there. Look at the openings every week. 

* Get on Monster/careerbuilder/Indeed/etc. look at the jobs, look at the descriptions, write your resume to the description (just don't lie). 

* Call a recruiter if necessary; examples: manpower/aerotec/etc... 

* talk to your professors about being a lab tech at school until you get enough experience to get out. 

* be open to move - look for companies locally, but keep in mind that you won't always be so fortunate. (I had to move for my job(s))

* Do due diligence and sharpen your searching skills in different industries: pharma (growing fast), biotech(small start-ups), materials(Dow), fabrics, instrumentation(Waters co), reagents labs, synthetic labs, bio labs, contract companies, auto industry, paints, food, medical, government, etc... 

* Do not feel bad after receiving 40 rejections (I applied to over 50 jobs and only got 1 phone interview)


I hope I got everything, I might edit to add some more/fix my grammar tomorrow. Let me know what you think. I'll edit in some things people found or think is useful. Also, this applies for the biologist in r/biology too... 

Edit 1: bullets didn't work.
Edit 2: I hated the first format

EDIT3: Grad school info for the uninformed

If you are thinking of being a full time masters student... DON'T... be a full time PhD student instead... why? **You get paid!** Well, you may also get paid being a full time masters student, however, the benefits of the PhD are better, academia/industry pay is better, experience needed to get the industry jobs is less, if you fail at the PhD they let you finish up and you come out with a masters anyway. While I was applying for jobs I always noticed that for the same job, a PhD student can come in with 0 work experience while I needed 10 years for the jobs that I thought were super cool.

1336353897.0	tahyt	Stories from a Chemical Hygiene Officer		85	7	20	"First, I was inspired by [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/t8ttr/i_just_got_chemical_burns_due_to_gross_negligence/) to think about some of the craziest things that I encountered as a Chemical Hygiene Officer.  

First, my background.  I am not a Chemist.  I was hired as a ""chemical safety specialist"" to basically administer lab inspections and run the stockroom.  My previous military experience as a Nuke helped me greatly when it came to getting my job.  My position evolved to Chemical Hygiene Officer for the College of Science and Engineering, then to Radiation Safety Officer for the University, and eventually to a Environmental Compliance Auditor for EPA Region 6 private schools.

1.  My Scariest Moment

When a package came into the stockroom, I checked the DOT labels to determine how to open the container.  It was too cumbersome to open everything in the hood, so if it had no labels I just opened it on the receiving table.  On a particular day, like any other, a single package came in.  No labels.  I put on my nitrile gloves and opened the container.  I removed a small bottle nestled in Styrofoam and immediately noticed that my glove was drenched.  Annoying.  It happens.  I look at the bottle and I immediately lose my shit.  The first word I see is Dimethylmercury.  I had taken lab safety classes and was aware of the tragic death of [Karen Wetterhahn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Wetterhahn).  My mind was racing.  My wife was pregnant and hadn't finished grad school.  What if I died and wasn't there to raise my child?  Awful thoughts ran through my head.  

I took off my gloves and placed them into a secured waste container.  I calmed down and walked to our most experienced Organic professor and told him what was happened.  His jaw dropped and he muttered, ""Fuck.""  We walked to the stockroom and I showed him the container.  I saw relief in his face, which then turned to anger.  The substance was a standard used by the biology department for a mercury analysis machine used to determine Hg concentration in fish.  I believe it was either a 1ppm or 1ppb standard.  I really can't remember.  I thought he was pissed at me for overreacting, but he was really mad at the professor who ordered it.  Never understood why.  Either way, I left work early to be with my pregnant wife and wind down.

2.  Most Embarrassing / Saddest Thing I Witnessed.

I was actually taking Organic Chemistry Lab to improve my practical chemical knowledge.  We were performing an extraction using dichloromethane.  Nothing fancy.  There was a real dunce in the class who had horrible lab technique.  It was obvious from the first lab.  The dunce went to pour his organic layer back into his sep funnel, but forgot to close the stopcock.  In addition, he was doing this outside of the hood with the glassware aimed right at his crotch.  After drenching his genitals with dichloromethane, he stood at his hood, too embarrassed to move.  I heard him go up to the TA and say, ""I think I messed up.""  By this point, his penis had started itching and burning and he was really worried.  I brought him down to the stockroom and had him strip down to his boxers while he stood underneath the safety shower.  I made him stand there for the whole recommended 15 minutes.  Sadly, the professor in charge of the lab heard about the accident and came in and bitched him out as he was standing there in his boxers.  I felt awful for the kid.  He dropped the class the next day and switched majors.  I don't think he was cut out to be a chemist, but I still felt awful for how he found out."	t5_2qhf9	True

The first thing we did was sealing off the room (with ""Stop! Radioactive!"" banners just to be sure). I had a long dialog with an industry partner, AF Defcom, about proper disposal. Before they would handle it they had to do a risk assessment of the operation, based of previous encounters (one time, they said, this stuff actually detonated in transport). They would carry it to a safe place and either shoot it or detonate it with a secondary explosive. Meanwhile another in our department had a dialog with the [Norwegian Defence Research Establishment](http://www.ffi.no/en/Sider/default.aspx). They handles explosives every day. And would do it for free. And today two people from the Establisment just walked straight in picked it up, walked straight out, like nothing... So now I wonder did I overreact? I feel like I did and all I did was acting on what I have read in the [Safety Datasheet [Norwegian]](http://app.ecoonline.no/ecosuite/applic/searchbuttons/showmsds.php?viewForm=htmlext&amp;accessKey=B/Gd55TCuBA8XsU3lOf5i3z3eJjbTjiQnvAfL9PmcKBERtbKcBi8BvlVCvCL4ame&amp;msdsLang=1): ""Risk of explosion by shock, friction, quick heating. Explosion on contact with metals. Fire may produce hazardous vapors / fumes of: nitrogen oxides (NOx)."" and ""Explosive when dry"". 

Edit: One more thing. One of the personnel, said it was less explosive then TNT. I countered it with the argument that the molecule itself is a phenol and the ring must per definition be more activated compared with toluene. He avoided me from that moment. I'm talking from a thermodynamic perspective, is there something I should know about the kinetics?"	t5_2qhf9	True

1341286571.0	vylu8	Explosives chemist (ex-explosives chemist), AMA.		86	16	73	"I'm bored and have time, so after the thread on neutralizing nitroglycerin, I thought I'd give a little background and give the opportunity to answer questions about such an esoteric field. My replies may be sporadic due to Web access, but I will answer all legitimate questions.

I spent several years making/researching explosives in a variety of environments. Most of this was spent with ""improvised"" terrorist explosives, improvised explosive devices, ammonium nitrate mixtures (""ANFO,"" although there are many substitutes for the fuel oil), safety testing, car bombs, nuclear weapons components, oilpatch stuff, novel compounds (high nitrogen stuff, heavy metals substitutes), pyrotechnic mixtures, pyro devices (including Space Shuttle components), all sorts of stuff.

Education: I have had several requests asking how to get into the field. I only know of a handful of people that have a formal explosives education, part of this being that few educational institutions offer that sort of thing. I'm not up on which ones do and which ones don't these days, so I can't really speak well to that. I recommend checking the journal [PEP](http://www.wiley-vch.de/publish/en/journals/alphabeticIndex/2014/) for the latest and greatest on who's doing what. Unfortunately, the really fun stuff never gets published (proprietary, classified, etc.).

Facilities that do work like this: China Lake, Sandia, Los Alamos, Indian Head NSW. Commercial: Nammo Talley, Thiokol, PacSci, SDI, Aerojet, BAE, and [several others.](http://www.tci-training.com/client-experience/)

Working conditions usually suck. Facilities tend to be dirty, you get exposed to stuff like perchlorates (thyroid damage) and heavy metals. Not all are very safe, although things are improving because insurance costs become insane once you start hurting people. A lot of people I know from industry have had permanent injuries, ranging from lost digits to serious burns from GAP (an ""energetic"" plasticizer).

Anyway- won't disclose who I am, but I'm happy to discuss any aspect of explosives chemistry."	t5_2qhf9	True

Prooffreader	75	7	126	When I was working in ACS quality control for a chemical wholesaler, I was determining the residue after evaporation of a sample of diethyl ether that had been returned from a customer. I asked my supervisor if I should do a peroxide test first, and she said no. So I measured some ether into a platinum dish that had been used so many times it was really creased, set the heat plate in the fume hood on 1, and prepared to wait for many hours. A half-hour later, flames were shooting four feet in the air; I had to hose down the fume hood with a fire extinguisher and clean it up afterwards. Later, I determined that there was a very tiny leak in the platinum dish; either that or peroxides caused the fire, I don't know which. 	t5_2qhf9	True

1371671241.0	1goctg	Why can hydrogen bonds only occur when H is bonded to F, O, or N?	DysthymicEconomist	85	24	54	"In my mind as long as the H atom is bonded to a more electronegative atom, the partial positive charge should help it undergo hydrogen bonding. Yet several sources explicitly outline just those three atoms. I notice they're both in the same period, and are the smallest electronegative atoms. Does their size contribute to H bonding?

Also just be be sure, hydrogen has be to both covalently bonded to F, O, or N; and *also* hydrogen bonded to an F, O, or N as a hydrogen bond acceptor. The last point is somewhat confusing too. I always supposed anything else that's electron withdrawing, and thus has a partial negative, should in theory be able to accept the H bond.

Anyway thanks for your help!"	t5_2qhf9	True

KingEbrius	87	28	15	http://www.youtube.com/user/NurdRage belongs to a Canadian chemist that shows various reactions of chemicals that few non-chemists would ever have the chance to see. It's part educational, yet always entertaining. He's about to have to quit with the series, due to moving to a less-friendly lab, that would restrict him from being able to make these videos. Without asking, the fans of the series have started an indieGoGo to help him get his own lab, and thus keep the show alive.    http://www.indiegogo.com/NurdRage Now I know that posting anything on Reddit is dangerous, and in no way am I asking for your money. I just think that this is something that you might appreciate, and might want to spread the word about. If anything, you guys might like the series, and that's good enough for me.

It translates roughly to:

""Sodium is an alkaline metal/Chlorine is an extremely toxic and irritant gas/Together they make Sodium Chloride, table salt; That makes me think/Nothing makes sense in life.""

I got pretty angry with the conclusion. It makes **all** sense! They teach this in the first classes of basic chemistry, how in the world someone can think that doesn't makes sense! *Grumble, grumble*.

Some years ago, when I told someone I was going to study chemistry, she replied, point blank: ""But, chemistry? It is such a dirty and toxic thing!"" (can't quite get the translation correct, but it was in those lines). Yeah buddy, try to live without any products that didn't involve any chemistry in their production... This really gets on my nerves.

Enclosed were Potassium Chloride, Calcium Chloride, Potassium Permanganate, Potassium Nitrate, Sodium Nitrate, Copper Sulfate Pentahydrate, Boric Acid (powdered), and Sodium Acetate. Pictures:[All](http://i.imgur.com/fRvqy), [close-up 1](http://i.imgur.com/eGrMJ), [close-up 2](http://i.imgur.com/Kr1bM), [close-up 3](http://i.imgur.com/wzHsM), [close-up 3](http://i.imgur.com/W8CXB).

I have to spend the day with my brother, and I was wondering what really cool experiments I could do with all this at my disposal? I'll post pictures of the really cool-looking outcomes.

Edit: Thanks so much for all the responses! Some of these experiments sound really interesting. Keep 'em coming!

update: I will not do any of these today, turns out I do not have the required extra materials outside the base compounds that are required. I'll buy all of them today (Glycerin, beakers, PVA, etc), and experiment tomorrow!

Update 2: Bought all the other materials and glassware, and while the experiments are going down tomorrow, pictures will be going up!

Update 3: Experiments to be carried out: Potassium Permanganate + Glycerin, Super Saturated Sodium Acetate experiment ([this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/yc5fc/i_found_these_chemicals_in_my_dads_basement_and/c5u9pph)), Antifreeze + Boric Acid ([this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/yc5fc/i_found_these_chemicals_in_my_dads_basement_and/c5ub8cv)), Matchsticks soaked in solutions &amp; burned ([this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/yc5fc/i_found_these_chemicals_in_my_dads_basement_and/c5uc7x2))

**Update 4: I did the Permanganate + Glycerin and the Boric Acid experiments today (the other two didn't work, may try tomorrow).

Not much happened for a few weeks, apart from the expected comments. A couple of days ago, however, I received an email from a person whose name I will not mention here, saying that he had forwarded my blog link to a post-doc in Olah's group. And lo and behold, they - Olah *et al.* - discussed a possible retort during a group meeting this week. Today, one of the graduate students posted an official statement, more or less, on my page. Scroll down to the latest comments. I must admit I never saw this coming. The page is just a hobby project of mine. I am both shocked and flattered.

My parents are being their usual Asian selves and are telling me I won't get a decent paying job in medicine, that I'll end up as a high school chemistry teacher, or that I won't get grants. They're pushing me for medicine but I've outright told them that I don't want to go into medicine. 

The problem here is, that I've started to believe it. I've started to believe that I won't get far in chemistry, that I will end up doing not much with my life on a low salary. Is this really the case? How difficult is it, on average, to break into the academic world of chemistry? Will I live a comfortable life? Because to be honest it's not all about the money, it's about doing something you love right? But I'd still like to live comfortably. 

EDIT: A few of you lovely people are telling me to go into chemical engineering. I simply cannot do this because here in the UK we pick a specific university and a specific course based on what subjects we took at school. I have not taken mathematics to a high enough level in order to meet the entry requirements for chemical engineering at probably all British universities. 

EDIT 2: Yes, I understand that I won't be getting physician pay with a chemistry degree, all I care about is living comfortably, and I would like to know if chemistry will allow me to live comfortably. 

EDIT 3, last one I promise: It would seem that about half of you are telling me to go for analytical chemistry, and half are saying chemical engineering. Can someone please clarify the pros and cons of each field, and the pros and cons of their *own* field as well please? Thanks."	t5_2qhf9	True

1358913135.0	173otk	NurdRage, an educational YouTube channel, is trying to crowd fund a new laboratory. Please help!	CyanideCloud	61	13	29	"#Link to Indiegogo page [here](http://www.indiegogo.com/NurdRage).  

A few weeks ago, NurdRage posted [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_LgXEp1Nh4&amp;list=UUIgKGGJkt1MrNmhq3vRibYA&amp;index=3), stating that he will be unable to continue to use his current lab for videos/experiments, and the channel will soon be coming to an end.  However, many viewers responded with something like ""Well, damn!  Let's just buy him a new lab!"" 

After seeing all of those comments, NurdRage posted [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I17YF76ucW4).  May as well give it a shot, I suppose.

###Short Summary

Since 2009 the YouTube channel NurdRage has produced educational chemistry videos. While there are lots of channels that explain chemistry our approach was to actually demonstrate it. We aim to enable and inspire by directly showing just how amazing chemistry can be.

But to continue this video series and expand it to even more sophisticated and exciting demonstrations we need to crowd source a new laboratory.

 
####What We Need &amp; What You Get

A new laboratory requires around *$250k minimum* in funding. This may seem excessive at first but it's largely because such a laboratory must be located on industrially zoned land. A basement lab in someone's home is technically not a legal use of residential land. And because we’ll be ordering significant quantities of dangerous chemicals we cannot simply hope law enforcement doesn’t notice.

###The money will go toward:

* Obtaining necessary permits and licenses for industrial activities (chemical transport permits, toxic waste disposal permits, etc.)
* Purchasing an industrial unit on properly zoned land (by far the biggest cost)
* Obtain insurance for said industrial activities
* Modifying the existing structure with extra ventilation for additional safety
* Installation of fume hoods
* Modifying existing plumbing to accommodate a laboratory setting
* Modifying existing electrical system for laboratory use
* Laboratory equipment and machinery (weigh scales, glassware, magnetic stir plates, vacuum pumps, etc.)
* Laboratory chemicals
* Digital filmmaking equipment (lights, cameras, computers, etc.)

**Two years of videos will be produced** at an intended rate of about one per week. If the YouTube channel becomes self-sustaining production will automatically continue into subsequent years.

 
###The Impact

Chemistry is one of the most misunderstood sciences often being portrayed as destructive or only useful for illegal purposes. News reports of clandestine drug labs and rising chemical phobia in products like sunscreen and shampoo has only served to darken that perception and perpetuate misinformation. NurdRage aims to show the other side of chemistry. While the destructive will always be a part of chemistry there is also the constructive, the transformative, and wondrous side that gives us so much from metals, to medicine to glow sticks.

I am not speaking from much experience here, having only my BS currently, and heading to grad school next month. What I do know, though, is that I am heading there looking forward to getting paid with a sizable stipend, as will most other graduate chemistry students, which is an advantage that is almost exclusive to chemists (other fields enjoy this benefit too). My tuition will be free, thanks to being able to cover the expense as a TA. Depending on my PI and my line of research, my hours have the potential to be flexible. There may be some weeks that I put in 60 hours, but there may be other where I only have to put in 20.

I will be making more money than many of my other friends will at their ""fresh out of college"" jobs. Some of them do not even *have* jobs landed yet, let alone in their field of study. I enjoy this benefit, while simultaneously working towards earning my degree, doing what I enjoy doing, earning posterity in the form of published, peer-reviewed scientific journal articles, and working amongst like-minded peers.

 When I have finished my degree (in what will most likely be **5-6** years, not 10 years like I have read in the previously mentioned thread), I will have a doctorate. I will get to have the pleasure of knowing that I am one of the foremost experts in the world in my particular thesis, and along the way I will have gotten paid to do it, will have been given the opportunity to meet and network with other in my field, and will have been able to practice my passion.

And that is why even if I have trouble finding a job after graduate school, I am not so worried about the future.

They all ""spammed"" /r/chemistry with links to sciencedaily. The oddness is they also seem to have comments in their history, but after perusing their history you can also see them as a new class of generic science spammers. It is a hard call to make, but as their usernames all have the similarities of having numbers appended to their usernames and the accounts were all created the same month, I'm more-or-less confident in my decision. But, I thought the rise of the science spammers should be brought to your attention.
