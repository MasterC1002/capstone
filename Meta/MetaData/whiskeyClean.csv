1369159353.0	1erzsz	My roommate and I tested our palates with a blind taste test last night.	LetThereBeR0ck	58	6	19	"I've been getting into Scotch lately and bought a bottle of Chieftain's Strathisla 10 Year on the recommendation of one of the owners at a nearby liquor store. I tried it, but found it lacking compared to my Macallan 12, perhaps due to it paler color. Aware of my own bias, I suggested to my roommate that we do a blind taste test of all of our scotches plus a few others. 

The six whiskies we sampled:

* Chieftain's Strathisla 10 Year

* Macallan 12 Year

* Bowmore Legend

* Talisker 18 Year

* Crown Royal Cask 16 (Canadian blended whiskey)

* Jameson Original (Irish Whisky)

I poured about 1oz in each of 6 identical glasses and put a splash of water in each to prevent the alcohol content from interfering with the tasting as much. The glasses were labeled 1-6 and I recorded which was which on a notepad. My roommate, who did not witness my preparation, then randomly labeled the glasses A-F, recorded which letter corresponded with which number and removed the numbers, all in my absence. Thus, neither of us knew which letter went with which whisky.

I gave my roommate the glasses in a random order to taste and he guessed which whisky each glass contained while I recorded his answers. He then did the same for me. We each made every effort not to look at the glasses we were tasting so the color wouldn't give it away, though the differences were minimal. 

My roommate got all six correct. I did not fare so well. Of the six, the Bowmore was the only one I got right, mostly due to the peatiness. I found that I liked Jameson a lot more than I had thought, and that my Crown Royal Cask 16 is my favorite of the lot. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I liked the Chieftain's about as much as the Macallan. The biggest surprise was that I identified the Talisker 18 as Jameson, and liked it the least of the lot. 

So I gained some insight about what I like and don't like about different whiskies, and discovered some of my biases. Next time I want to throw some bourbons into the mix. 

Have any of you ever tested your palate with a blind taste test? You may find your taste isn't as discriminating as you though, and that price does not necessarily correlate to preference."	t5_2r06y	True

1360773428.0	18g9xn	Why Maker's Mark recipe change matters.	darthcarl	62	13	61	"The Samuels family had been making whiskey for six generations.  The quality of the whiskey made at the family distillery wasn't that great.  Bill Samuels Sr. decided to try to make a premium whiskey, an enterprize his father had prevented him from trying.  He purchased a distillery down the road with a limestone spring and began to wrok on his formula.  His wife, Maggie, baked loaves of bread with different grain combinations to figure out the taste profile that Bill Sr. wanted.  Legend says that he burned the old family recipe upon finaly tasting his new whiskey.  Maggie named it Makers Mark after the marks on her pewter collection that signify hand crafted quality.  

And how did I learn this story? Rob Samuels told it to me.  The current COO of Makers Mark told an audience the story of his whiskey's birth and went on to explain how it's still hand crafted.  He told us that the recipe and manufacturing techniques mattered.  And in an audience of whiskey drinkers it didn't take much to convince anyone.  We were on his side and we appreciated that he understood. 

But the recipe is really only 60 years old. Is it old enough to be held as that sacred?  It is only because they told us it is.  Makers has claimed that their hand crafted process, still in use, is what makes them special.  They put themselves above the other whiskeys.  They claimed to be more caring, more unique, and initially more expensive (their marketing campaign was based on their high price).

So they have violated my trust, a trust that they made every attempt to establish.  I and anyone who held Makers Mark to the high standards they set for themselves are reacting to that loss.  I'm sure I will drink Makers after the change, but only as least objectionable option in a bar and not as a bottle on my shelf.  "	t5_2r06y	True

We (my friends and the father that passed away) tasted it a month ago at the whisky festival in The Hague. I can still remember the look on his  face when he tasted it. 
He suddenly passed away, and it's quite the shock.

I also think that if you distill a white dog from 50% corn and age it four years in oak, it's not going to suck. Sure, Evan Williams isn't the best but I've never met a bourbon I didn't like. So here's my question. You can get decent mixing or shooting bourbon for $15 a bottle. Beam, Evan Williams, Ancient Age, etc. The blended scotches in that price range are undrinkable. Cutty Sark, J&amp;B and the like are awful. The ""worst"" blends I can stomach are Johnnie Black and Dewars, and those are around $30 per bottle. At this range you can get Bulleit or Buffalo Trace or Four Roses Single or a hundred other delicious bourbons. If you get to the nice single malt territory, you're into the land of exquisite bourbon.

I like my Manhattans with a heavy dose of vermouth, shaken, and poured into a chilled glass--i.e. not on the rocks. I've been having trouble communicating this to the bartenders though. Sometimes when i order them, the bartenders will just pour everything into a low ball glass on rocks thereby ruining my $10 drink.

What is the most succinct way of communicating to the bartender how i like it? would something like ""manhattan shaken, no rocks"" work? Or do i need to add anything else in?"	t5_2r06y	True
1355077679.0	14k1qb	Follow-up to tea + alcohol recipes (x-post from r/tea)	guyflannigan	32	2	5	"The tea party was last night, and I'd have to say it was a huge success. I think the favored drink by far was vanilla chai with Rum Chata (Vanilla RumChaita). It tasted like cake. It was amazing.

Also tried were chai and rum, Earl Grey infused Gin and tonics, Lapsang Souchong infused Gin and Tonics (which I dubbed the Forest Fire), Earl Grey and scotch (The United Kingdom), Roasted Chestnut tea with Crown Royal Maple, white wine mulled with our local tea store's spiced tea blend (black tea, cinnamon, cloves, some other stuff), red wine mixed with some other spice tea, Lipton with Two Gingers whiskey - but fear not, we've now upgraded him from crappy Lipton to loose tea, and a black tea and mango blend with rum.
We also just tried some of the random teas we picked up before the party from the previously mentioned local tea store. My new favorite being a cherry green tea.

Then we played Cards Against Humanity and laughed until it hurt.

Thanks a lot for all of your recommendations. I'd have to say that all of the drinks maintained their tea flavor rather well. Everything was just brewed normally, poured into a cofee mug, and then we threw in about a shot worth of alcohol.
If you guys are interested, I'd say definitely give it a shot. We converted a Lipton tea bag drinker to loose leaf teas, found a tea or two a non-tea drinker enjoyed, and the rest of us who already love tea found even more flavors/blends we like with or without alcohol.

Thanks again for recommendations."	t5_2r06y	True

1359055920.0	177fq5	How to evaluate whiskey	adremeaux	44	13	4	"I wrote this up a couple years ago, but I thought it may be helpful to this sub. I've been reviewing beer/wine/liquor for 8 years, and these are some tips and tricks I've learned.

Try to describe these characteristics when evaluating scotch, wine, craft beer, etc:

Appearance: What does it look like? Color. ""Legs"" (for wine, sake, mead). ""Head"" and lacing (for beer). Does it look delicious sitting there in your glass? Or does it look like cheap, artificial color like JD or Cuervo? An older drink will often (not always) be darker than a newer one. Certain types of barrel finishes, such as Pedro Ximenez sherry, will darken the scotch significantly.

Nose/Aroma: How does it smell? This is often the most distinct part of a scotch. Place your nose a decent length away from the glass and slowly move forward (while smelling) until you get the alcohol burn. You don't want that, so back up a little. Smell your shirt/shoulder (this will ""reset"" your nose, and is a great trick), then go in for the real aroma test. Take small sniffs, big ones, long and slow ones, etc. Anything that comes to you, write it down. If your nose becomes fatigued, come back to it a couple minutes later, you'll be amazed how different things are when your nose has properly rested. It is very easy to burn your nose out with scotch. Don't be afraid to move on to different parts of the evaluation and come back to the nose. You really should be smelling before every sip anyway, it is the best part!

Palate: How does the wine/whisky/beer feel in the mouth? Thickness of body. Alcohol burn. Intensity of flavor. Smoothness. Sweetness. Acidity. Bitterness. Does it make your mouth feel dry? Warm? This is specifically how it feels in the mouth, not how it tastes. That's next.

Flavor: How does it taste? Quite difficult with whiskys due to their strength, but do your best! With wine and beer, you can swish in your mouth, but that's tough with scotch. Take a slow sip. If you can, inhale and exhale through your nose while holding it in your mouth. Again, write down any descriptors that come to you. Take a fast sip; see if you get anything different.

Finish: After you finish your sip, how long do the flavors in your mouth last, and what are they? That is the finish. Breathe out heavily through your nose right after swallowing. You'll often pick up on more flavors and complexities here than when it is directly in your mouth.

Overall: What are your distinct impressions? Sometimes you'll come up with a huge list of descriptors but still not like the dram. Sometimes you'll come up with nothing and still adore it.

Score: Out of 100, but the vast majority of the scale is ignored. Below 75 is pretty much junk. Above 90 is excellent, and above 95 is world class. I'd say your average whiskey would sit around 82. "	t5_2r06y	True

**2 Oz Rye Whiskey (Willet, or see below)**

**1 Oz Antica Formula Carpano Sweet Vermouth**

**5 Dashes Bitters**

**Shake on ice, strain and serve up. Garnish with Les Parisiennes cherries (semi-candied, marinated in kirsch brandy).**

This recipe comes from The National Restaurant in Athens Georgia, where they do it slightly differently: Old Overholt Rye is soaked with Ceylon Tea and Thyme for 1 month in a mason jar, and mixed 2:1 with the Vermouth before being placed in an oak serving cask, and drawn off as needed. Add Bitters, shake, strain, and garnish. I haven't had this version, but the Willet variation is outstanding.

Lokabf3	25	5	23	"So, growing up, at family events, there was always a bottle of Canadian Whiskey set out for the men to have a shot of.   Especially at special events, like their kid's weddings, confirmations, funerals, etc.

I really liked the idea, and wanted to get a few bottles to put away for my kids future events.   Of course, at this point, I couldn't drink whiskey straight up without making it 1/2 &amp; 1/2 with water, Plus ice, and even then I couldn't stand it.  Of course, I also had no idea what good whiskey was, so i was probably drinking all the wrong ones.

Well, I figured if i was going to have a good whiskey to put away, i'd have to do some research.   Next thing you know, I now own every premium canadian whiskey that they sell here.   I even have a rare bottle of Wisers Red Letter, that i have yet to open.   

I've now started to enjoy the flavours so much, that water or ice isn't allowed within 10 feet of my glass, and i've started building on Scotches, Single Malt Whiskies, and even a bourbon (bookers!)

Anyways, hello all, and looking forward to endlessly going on about how wonderful premium canadian whiskies are :)

1362345730.0	19lh27	Slowing Building a Respectable Bar; Starting with some Whiskey	RadicalEucalyptus	22	4	13	"Hello everyone!  I have been a Reddit lurker for quite some time now, but have clearly never posted before this time.  My wife-to-be bought be ""The Ultimate Bar Book"" as a Christmas present, and I am not entirely sure she knew what she was getting into.  Whereas before I was basically a Wine drinker who would stay stocked up on Kahlua and Vodka for White Russians (inspired largely by my love for a certain Coen Bros. film), now I am stocking up a nice bar to try all kinds of things.

So, yesterday I came home with a nice grip of liquor, including a pair of whiskeys which were recommended by those posting in this subreddit:  Maker's Mark and Buffalo Trace.

Yesterday I tried the Maker's Mark clean, and found myself to really like it.  I have yet to try the Buffalo Trace, but I plan to try that in the next couple of days.  Then I want to try tastes of them side-by-side, to see if I can distinguish between them.  Interestingly, I basically grew up in a family that loved to drink Jack Daniels (and sometimes Jim Beam), so I am familiar with the whiskey milieu.  I even got to drink some as a youngster during sporting events (Whenever the Avalanche would score a goal in the Stanley Cup).  So, I am excited to branch out a little more, and try some different things.  I was fortunate enough to try some Pappy Van Winkle 15yr last week when a bunch of coworkers went out to a whiskey bar, and I think that is what finally convinced me that I might like whiskey as an adult (a few years back, I tried some Jack Daniels, and didn't much care for it). 

In the nest week or so, I expect to get a shipment form Amazon containing some Angostura Bitters and cherries, so that I can make some Manhattans and Old Fashioneds.  In the meantime, I just wanted to pop out from lurking, thank the posters in the reddit for good recommendations, and introduce myself.

Thanks again!"	t5_2r06y	True

The only redeeming quality of the Gold and Platinum label was a faint hint of some of the nicer Highland whiskeys... mixed in with the distinctive dry hay and cardboard that I taste in all Johnny Walkers so far. 

None of this would bother me (hell, there are plenty of cheap stock whiskeys) but what I find so strange is that supposed whiskey connoiseurs sing its praises (Christopher Hitchens for one) and tell me the black label is amazing, the best whiskey on the market... etc etc. I am completely at a loss to understand this.

1348426131.0	10cobm	Posted a while ago that I never drank alcohol before, now I have	TheSecretMe	25	6	27	"A while ago [I posted how I'd never drank alcohol before](http://www.reddit.com/r/whiskey/comments/z58yr/so_ive_never_drank_alcohol_before/). Since I got some good advice in that thread I figured I'd make a second post.

Most of you seemed to agree that the best way to start would be with a simple beer, not whiskey or other liquor. Out of respect for your valued advice I did try, but I have to admit that I never cared for beer much and didn't change my opinion after trying.

After beer, I took a look at the [recommendations for beginners](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P-BPHpjGkGM6g1vlrAEXms_G-3jNr78Yh_r3_YpW2Iw/edit?pli=1) over at /r/scotch. I ended up picking up a bottle of Highland Park 12 because of the recommendations. 

Later that night I prepared a glass with some ice made from distilled water to chill and dilute it a little for the first time. And you were right. The experience can only be described as ""interesting... argh"". Spend the next few evenings getting used to it with a moderate glass a night. I am starting to enjoy it quite a bit, although I think part of the enjoyment is just getting buzzed at the end of a stressful day. But compared to way people talk about whiskey here, I can only describe the flavor as complex.

So complex in fact that I decided I'd need a different whiskey to discern flavors. I consulted the same document and decided on Johnnie Walker black, based on the differing flavor description and the fact that it's the easiest to find whiskey in bars. Ended up buying the smallest bottle I could find.

Again, I could only describe the flavor as complex. But complex in a different way than the bottle of Highland Park I bought. Slightly gentler perhaps if I'd risk an actual description? Either way, I gained a new sense of understanding for those who try to describe the personality of a drink. I do find myself consciously thinking about the sip I just took.

Either way, I'd like to thank those who got me on my way earlier. I feel like I have an interesting new journey ahead."	t5_2r06y	True

The bartender got some wires crossed in his head, and instead of a straight Johnny red, he made a Johnny red with Red Bull. It was.....FUCKING INCREDIBLE. I passed it around and everyone who tried it had the same reaction I did. We happily reported to our bartender that this was an awesome mistake.

1352583038.0	12zabh	Confusion over whiskey &amp; water	Shurikane	20	3	20	"So!  Hi.

I've been browsing over a few whiskey videos recently and something has eluded me: the inclusion of water.  A short list of facts:

* On my cylinder of Aberlour A'bunadh, it says to add a bit of water.  Okie doke, fair enough.  Thing starts out at 60% ABV so this makes sense.

* Then I watch the (in)famous [Whyte &amp; Mackay](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjrkd_RZFFY) video and somewhere around the 1:40 mark, Richard says to add water to bring the whiskey down to 35% ABV, which is the ideal strength for bringing out the whiskey in the palate, quote-unquote.  Okay, duly noted.

* Then further along the video, at the 4:00 mark, he pours himself a 22 year-old... and then specifically says **not** to add water despite the aforementioned whiskey being a 40%.

Hold on, what happened to that magic 35% number?

Do different sorts/ages of whiskey have a different ideal ABV?  Is the water addition reserved for younger and/or cask-strength whiskeys?

I've a feeling I'm missing a guideline here.  Can someone enlighten me on this?  Putting one's personal taste aside, when's the recommended situation in which to add a splash of water?"	t5_2r06y	True

I'm new to this r/Whiskey and looking for guidance in whisky appreciation.

In brief, I'm a student looking for a new drink something a little more sophisticated than vodka's and cheap beer. Craft beers &amp; stout are great but after a long week I'd rather something different, I'd rather Whiskey.

I have taken to Jameson, on the rocks w/ a drop of water, as it being drink of choice of my granddad &amp; I'm quite enjoying it. However, It is a little strong neat and I've not quite adjusted to the harsher taste quite yet! (I like the fact is relaxing and longer lasting than most drinks on a night out). What can I do to help change this, what lower range Whiskeys are more palatable to the less experienced sippers? 

Today I've bought a bottle of Whyte &amp; Mackay Special ( a double marriaged blended scotch whisky) How should I enjoy this? 
They say the glass is everything is this style suitable as my primary [vessel](http://mildconcern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Jameson-Irish-Mule-2.png?) ?

As a quick guide,
Jameson - I like, little strong but nice.
Paddy - Not so much
JD - I dunno why just not my style
Southern Comfort - I know it is not a whiskey as such but I'm quite fond of this with a slice of Lime.

I have a sweet tooth so is there any particular combination that will ease me into whisky while not loosing its finer qualities?

So r/Whiskey can you help a young fella out?"	t5_2r06y	True

What I didn't see was any mention of Benchmark Bourbon. I had the pleasure of trying it at a wedding of a good friend in New Orleans. At $15 a handle, it has become my go-to everyday whiskey that I keep in my decanters. 

Googled it for some more information and found out it is bottled at Sazerak's Buffalo Trace distillery in Frankfort, KY. They bought the brand from Seagrams back in the 80's. It was originally created in the 60's as a high-end/luxury bourbon. 

Not sure about their distribution outside of the south, but if you come across it on you next trip to the liquor store, I highly recommend you give it a swirl."	t5_2r06y	True
1346435164.0	z58yr	So, I've never drank alcohol before	TheSecretMe	22	6	22	"Here's the deal, bear with me for a moment. I used to be big on self denial when it came to substances. I didn't need caffeine in the morning to get started and I didn't need to party in an alcoholic daze to have fun at night. I got my kicks spending every penny jumping out of airplanes, scuba diving, flying and other such pursuits.

It worked for me and that's fine. Now I find myself getting older. Life slowed down, responsibilities are stacking up and that's fine too. I grew up along with my responsibilities, I learned how to handle them. It also means that at the end of the day I'm more likely to sit back in a comfortable chair to reflect and appreciate than I am to go out and do something that'll get my heart rate up to a 100 miles an hour.

Amongst other things, I find myself thinking perhaps this is a good time to expand my horizons. I'm not looking to go on an alcoholic bender but I'm gaining interest in finding and appreciating something of quality. Something that'll take the edge of at the end of a long day and add just the right touch to a good evening.

Now for the most part these alcoholic reddits are doing an excellent job of providing reviews and other such documentation but I have to admit that I do not yet understand the language of the realm. Just looking at this [flavor wheel](http://i.imgur.com/SDn6c.jpg) I find myself trying to reconcile phrases like ""Cabbage Water"" and ""Sea shells"" with drinks.

I suppose I'm asking you fine redditors to help me pick my poison. Feel free to ask me questions, offer advice or ridicule my investigative approach to drinking."	t5_2r06y	True

Maker's 46 Bourbon Whiskey
94 Proof (46% Alc/vol)

**The Visual Inspection:**
In reference to this [chart](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg)
The whiskey is a dark caramel color, between a 1.6 and 1.7.  When swirled, it produces thin, yet slow moving tears. 

**The Nosing:**
[Nosing Chart](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Whiskywheel-Big.jpg)
On the initial smell, it has a winey/nutty aroma to it. Additional smelling reveals a vanilla/woody smell. After letting the whiskey sit for awhile and breath, a strong caramel and oaky aroma arise. The whiskey tingles the nostrils, but not a large burning sensation. 

**The Taste:**
If you have tasted the original Maker's Mark, you would immediately recognize that this is the same family. Maker's 46 has a more complex flavor to it than Maker's Mark does.  It starts out with a strong oaky flavor and stays smooth with caramel overtones. The aftertaste is a quite pleasant caramel flavor.

I give it an 8/10 and highly recommend a try for those who like bourbon. It may be a bit too sweet for those who like Rye and other dry whiskeys.  I hope you find this useful, it's my first review.

Also, I used [this page](http://www.whiskymag.com/nosing_course/index.php0) for help with the review. It's quite helpful.*edit to add this link*

I was first introduced to the King Cube when I was at bar and ordered an Old Fashioned(this bar makes the best one in the city and I had to get one). When I got the drink it had ONE MASSIVE ICE CUBE in it. I asked the bartender why they use it.

He told me that any whiskey drink that requires ice got a king cube because of how slow the ice melted. This resulted in a whiskey drink that was chilled and very little water entering the drink. I witnessed this after taking my time enjoying my drink and after 30-45min the ice cube was still standing quite large being that it is 3oz of water.

If you are looking to get a King Cube tray the best place to look is [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Tovolo-KING-Cube-Trays-Blue/dp/B00395FHRO).

I'm also getting an ice sphere mold as a gift. Just a cheap one not the $800 ones and will do a review of that once I get to try it in a drink or two. Apparently the Ice Sphere is suppose to melt even slower because of how little surface area there is in contact with the whiskey. "	t5_2r06y	True

When I first opened the bottle and took a smell I was hit with a wood, vanilla and toffee type of scent. Taste was almost the same as the smell. It had a lot of hints of a spiced rum being that this whiskey was matured in a rum cask. 

I really enjoyed this whiskey and plan on buying it or something else from The Balvenie. They are quite expensive this bottle was around $80-90 in Canada but will be much less in America.

1348925943.0	10nzux	Neat Surcharge	Copernican	18	5	30	"So I've been drinking whiskey and bourbon neat or with a splash of water for 4 years.  I used to live in Tacoma, WA and would occasionally go out to Seattle.  I've been living in Manhattan now for the past year.  Last night I, for the first time in my life, experienced a $2 surcharge for ordering a drink neat.  I was pretty upset about the charge and asked what it was.  Apparently the surcharge for a whiskey on the rocks is only $1.  The justification for the price was that each style required a different volume of Whiskey.  Now I was only drinking a $6 whiskey (my friend suggested I try drinking Powers and I did not like it) so I doubt it was even that good of a deal for the extra whiskey like the bartender suggested (maybe if I was getting a $12 whiskey it could possibly be worth it).

Now here's my question, since when does the term ""on the rocks"" or ""neat"" have any bearing on the volume of liquid poured into a glass?  Doesn't the term neat simply mean a drink is a pour straight from the bottle without anything added?

Anyways, I didn't tip the bartender because I was pissed off after our argument.  Unless I specify I want a double I am expecting the standard volume regardless of how I want it served and in what type of glassware.  I don't want to be charged more because the bartender thinks there is an aesthetic need to make the glass look more full.  It also makes me wonder how to order a whiskey at it's standard priced volume in anything other than a shot glass.

Am I crazy for being mad about his practice?  Is it rare that this is my first time coming across this?  I go to a beer and bourbon bar all the time in the East Village (Idle Hands) and I trust their whiskey etiquette much more than the place I was at last night.  I've never seen different charges or volumes poured for rocks or neat drinks there.

 1. whiskey stones - they seem good but inappropriate for a Glencairn glass because you want a high ratio of stones to whiskey volume to get a good chill
 2. on the rocks (for cheap whiskey?)
 3. stirred with an ice cube then served without the ice cube (up style? how do you order it this way ""Id like a knob creek served up?"" 
 4. diluted with chilled bottle water
 5. very chilled mixers (triple sec/coke again for cheaper whiskeys only? on the knob creek website is a suggestion to add a  splash of triple sec.. seems ok but also like a waste of perfectly fine knob creek!)


Out of all of these methods the one i like the most is method 3. 
It 

* chills whiskey without over chilling it, 
* dilutes the whiskey without over diluting it
* simultaneously
* requires a second cup

I noticed the Lagavulin 16 tucked away in the back of the shelf in a corner, a couple spots over from the Macallan and far away from center stage.  

I asked the the bartender what it was and she described it as peaty and very smoky.  Being quite familiar with Laphroaig it struck a chord so I ordered a glass neat.  I was not prepared...

While I waited for the order I looked up the bottle on my phone and saw that it was distilled on Islay and every review touted its glory.  When I took my first sip I immediately noticed that it actually tasted less smokey than my experiences with Laphroaig 10yr.  However, where it lacked in this area, it made up for in every other, with a very complex blend of harsh and pleasant flavors from start to finish.  This was perhaps the most full-bodied whisky I've ever had.  I liked that, since some people (read: most of my friends) complain about the overwhelming flavor of smoke in Laphroaig.  This drink offers quite a bit more variety in flavor

I'll be honest, it was on the edge of too much at first, but by the end of the glass my expectations were realigned and I was glad to have stumbled upon this name.

I decided to make this post in /r/whiskey because it says scotch-whiskey on the bottle, and the rules of the subreddit state that both are fine! I apologize in advance if it is better suited somewhere else.

  As for the bottle,
This past weekend, I was cleaning out a house that was built during the great depression. It was built by relatives of my grandparents (on my father's side) and later on, around the 1950's, my grandparents purchased the house from said relatives. My uncle and father were both raised in that house. During my father's childhood, he remembered a man (he his unable to recall who he was) that would every so often pull this bottle from a closet, take a swig and promptly put it back inside the closet. My father was only a few years old at the time. Well over time, the bottle was forgotten, until my dad discovered it again this past weekend. 

  Here are pictures of the bottle: [the bottle](http://imgur.com/a/HvPSm#1)
The bottle says ""1934"", unfortunately I am unable to say if this is the year the product started to ""age"" at, subsequently making its beginning market year 1942. Or ""1934"" could be the year it was first marketed at, thus making its contents (at the start of the aging process) from 1925, which means it was created during the alcohol prohibition in America (the earlier makes more sense, logically).
As for the contents, there is about 1/4 (maybe more) of the liquor remaining in the bottle. Any information/explanation regarding this alcohol/bottle/company would be greatly appreciated. Also if the remnants (or the bottle) is worth any monetary value, an estimate would be greatly appreciated. My apologies for the rough shape of the bottle.

IWTL about whiskey	denejagish	19	7	18	"So here is the thing, for about 4 months ago I started a new job as a waiter/bartender at a whiskey &amp; beer pub, after only 2 months of waitering(?) in my whole life. We have a wide variety of whiskeys (about 250) and beers (150 i think). The problem is I know nothing about whiskey and have only sipping it since last summer. At the same time I have spent many nights after my work at reddit.

So after these months of understanding reddit and my job, I know want to bring those together, by your help, help me in my job. So at this point I know that whiskey is done with the same ingridients as beer. Whiskey from each whiskey got it's own characteristic(?!). Islay is the most peated, while lowland is the smoothest. highland, speyside orkney and the islands i have no ideá of. I have drunk glenkinchie 20y, bowmore 18, lagavulin 16

talisker 16
johnny walker blue label
springbank 18 and some more I cant remember. 
I can't say that I really can point out all the tastes from all i have tried but some of them i remember.

1326732988.0	ojg37	Help me design my World of Whisky beginners' tasting party	josepheh	13	0	14	"For my birthday about a year from now, I would like to hold a whiskey tasting party. I've been to a handful of single-malt Scotch tastings, and enjoyed the experience of tasting a variety from sweet to peat, with a little education thrown in. So I know a little about single-malt Scotch, but really not all that much, and have a similar level of knowledge about whiskey in general. Mainly I just know I like it, and it has happy associations in my memory. Grandpa liked whiskey, and the smell of whiskey in various forms is an indelible part of my memories of him. I confess I might have tasted a few watery sips from the end his glass as a tyke too...

I'm also not planning to be a snob. I like Scotch but don't want to limit myself to that. In addition to those grandpa memories, there's a little bit of ""roots"" motivation to this too. My genealogical heritage is pretty much the Irish and Scottish (and Anglo) diaspora, and I'd like to be recognize my forebears and cousins making and drinking whiskey here in the Americas, and elsewhere, as much as I do those who stayed behind. In short: I'm a British colonial mutt and I'll be proud to drink like one.

So, goals: Help an unsophisticated whiskey-liker, and my friends, learn a bit more by tasting a variety of the world's whiskeys in one sitting. I'd like to end the evening with all of us knowing some history through the lens of whiskey-making, and having maybe a tiny bit more of an informed palate the next time we drink a whiskey of any kind. Overall I'd like to have a selection that will help people explore two types of inquiry:
- What does one good whiskey, typical of this style, taste like?
- How does this whiskey compare to those in other styles?

Budget: I don't want to make this into a life-defining avocation. General off-the-shelf availability in US liquor stores is a plus. Life is too short to drink the cheap stuff from the bottom shelf, but I'm not going to drop 3 figures on any of these bottles either. I would like to think you don't have to be rich to enjoy good whiskey (not the best, just the good), just willing to spend a little extra. I'd like to get out of this for under $300. That's part of the reason I'm willing to spend a year preparing: I just don't have a lot of money to spend on this, and not all at once. Perhaps things go on sale? Perhaps I'll be travelling and have opportunities to shop around? I need a shopping list I can keep in my wallet, with an idea of what will be good price.

So, I need to choose bottles that are very representative of their style, good quality, and fit within my budget.

Starting list of destinations (feel free to suggest amendments):
Scotch (this seems to cover a *lot* of stylistic territory so willing to have more than one, but remember this is a world tour); Irish; Canadian; Bourbon (is Tennessee different enough to warrant it's own entry?)

Um, help me out.

TLDR: Looking for an affordable list of good representative whiskeys to do a ""world tour"" beginners' tasting party.

Also I was reading more about the shapes of whiskey glasses and came across some article that said the traditional ones (the straight up and down cups with thick bottoms) are actually not the right shape and they showed some glass that looked like a wine glass which they said was better is this true?

Its not the best mexican food in the world, hell its such an american institution now it may not even be mexican food anymore. But no matter where you are, what time it is, or how hung over you might be, you can always get the same tasty burrito supreme and soft tacos you had 20 years ago. And all for only a few bucks. Bang for your buck people. JD has it in spades.

For no other reason, Jack Daniels will always be stocked in my bar. Its consistency and affordability make it a solid choice for any Tuesday night after a long day at work. Make a Jack and Coke, sip it with ice, but its not really the type of product to drink neat ;)

Recommended: Yes
Notes: Smokey with definite charcoal taste. A little ice/water rounds it out nicely with a smooth aftertaste of citris and maple.
Price: $18 for 750ml

I'm a network admin and my business partner is an attorney.  We met through our wives, who used to work together.  We're in Texas - DFW area specifically.  Been making beer and hard cider for years, and we just decided to get into distilling and take our hooch to the masses.  We're looking to produce a variety of spirits.

* Canadian
* Irish
* Scotch
* Bourbon

Macallan and various scotch is too strong for my tastes, jack daniel's and various bourbon whiskeys are managable but not as enjoyable.

1366528495.0	1csfqq	Suggestions for an introductory Whiskey Flight	workerBeej	9	0	14	"Hi Folks, I've been drinking various whiskies for about a year now and have had much fun trying a few single malts and reading reviews but now I would like to widen the range of whiskies I've tried personally. As I am hobby-rich and finances-poor, this is tricky. My solution is Whisk(e)y club! I've got a few friends interested and we'll all chip in each month toward some bottles. Our plan, loosely, is to cover a wide range of styles and distillieries in the first few meetings, then once we've covered the usual expressions from a good number of distillieries we'll go deeper into different ages for our favourites. A fun and cost-effective method of self-educating in a town with no whisky bars.

As Scotch is my favourite, for the first meet I'm planning that we'll cover the major areas of Scotland with some representative malts. Each shouldn't be too unusual as there will be some in the club who've never tried a dram at all. For instance my focus is usually around Islay, Laphroaig being my preference, but it might be a bit strong for an intro to Islay, so I've gone with Bowmore.  To avoid being too parochial, I'll also throw in a couple of world whiskies too. My question is, does this look like a good plan for that? Any substitutions / key tastes missed out completly? (Some of these I haven't tried, some whole areas I haven't tried!) Bonus points if I can get these on offer in UK supermarkets! More bonus points for suggestions of where to go from here!

* **Highland**: Dalwhinie

* **Island**: Talisker

* **Islay**: Bowmore 12

* **Speyside**: The Glenlivet (1st choice) or Glenfiddich (currently on offer!)

* **Lowlands**: (No idea! Something lighter / sweeter than the rest?)

* **Bourbon**: Buffalo Trace

* **Irish**: Jameson

I'm new to whiskey and more knowledgeable/comfortable with beer and I would like to try more whiskeys. I have only had: Jack Daniels, Jim Beam, Jack Daniels Single Barrel, Jim Beam Black, Wild Turkey 101, and Crown Royal before.

So far my favorite has been the JD Single Barrel and Jim Beam, but I'm looking for something better. I'm looking at getting a bottle of something ""High End"" along with something cheaper to have.

I stopped in at my local liquor store and noted these down: **Maker's Mark, Maker's Mark 46, Knob Creek, Knob Creek Single Barrel, Bookers, Woodford Reserve,** and **Blanton's**.

So far I'm thinking about picking up the Blanton's for my high end (If that's what it is considered), but I'm not sure what to pick up for a cheaper option. My idea is something not necessarily ""less quality"" but something I could drink straight and not feel guilty about mixing. 

So what are your recommendations? I'm curious as to Maker's Mark vs the Maker's Mark 46, and I saw in a thread that the Knob Creek Original? is better than the Single Barrel?

Also, I'm located in PA and [here is the website for our state liquor store](http://www.finewineandgoodspirits.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/SpiritsCatalogSearchResultView?tabSel=2&amp;sortBy=&amp;sortDir=&amp;storeId=10051&amp;catalogId=258552&amp;langId=-1&amp;parent_category_rn=Spirits&amp;newsearchlist=no&amp;resetValue=0&amp;searchType=Spirits&amp;minSize=&amp;maxSize=&amp;promotions=&amp;rating=&amp;vintage=&amp;specificType=&amp;price=&amp;maxPrice=0&amp;varitalCatIf=&amp;region=&amp;country=&amp;varietal=&amp;listSize=&amp;searchKey=&amp;pageNum=1&amp;totPages=1&amp;level0=Spirits&amp;level1=S_Bourbon&amp;level2=&amp;level3=&amp;keyWordNew=false&amp;VId=&amp;TId=&amp;CId=&amp;RId=&amp;PRc=&amp;FPId=&amp;TRId=&amp;ProId=&amp;isKeySearch=&amp;SearchKeyWord=Name+or+Code).

1321899468.0	mkdy3	I have to share with you my amazing Whiskey adventure of the past week	intherearview	11	2	8	"I just have to tell you about this as no one else in my life really cares much about whiskey - It was an amazing week for me! On Tuesday I went to the [Philly Whiskey Fest](http://www.phillymag.com/whiskeyfest/spiritlist.html) with a ""Must Try All The Things!"" mentality. While I came up a bit short here is a list of everything I did try:

- **Angel's Envy** - Amazing. I also met and talked with Lincoln. He was great to talk to and so legitimately excited about his whiskey and whiskey in general. We drank some tequila together under his recommendation - I thought that was funny.

- **Ardbeg 10 year** - I'm glad I tried it but I preferred Laphroaig

- **Eagle Rare Single Barrel 17 Year** - I'm glad I tried this too because I have a bottle of the Eagle Rare 10. I was thinking of buying the ER 17 and now I'm not. When the 10 is gone I'm definitely buying ...

- **Basil Hayden** - GREAT STUFF. If you like Eagle Rare give this a go.

- **Glenfiddich 21 Year** - very good. I have the 15 year at home so I made it a point to try. Considering the price I don't think it is a buy for me but again, I was glad to have it.

- **Laphroaig 18 Year** - The Laphroaig 10 is my favorite scotch so I wanted to try all of their offerings. The 18 year was fantastic, everything I hoped the sequel to the 10 year would be.

- **Laphroaig Quarter Cask** - I did not like this as much as the others, but it was the last I tried and I may have had some residual taste in my mouth. I'll be more than happy to give it another go.

- **Laphroaig Triplewood** - Loved it. Such a distinct and original taste. It was like squeezing the 10 year out of a saturated piece of wood straight from the cask. I'll be buying this in the very near future.

- **Whistle Pig Straight Rye** - I saw this recommended by someone on reddit who went to the NY fest and decided to give it a go. I bought a bottle a day later and I should have bought 2.

- **Death's Door White Whiskey** - I was excited to try a white whiskey, they are all the rage apparently. It was interesting and I recommend that every whiskey drinker try one. The flavors are so young that it is like reaching into a barrel of mash and chewing it. You can almost taste each individual ingredient. 

- **Balvenie 12 Year Doublewood** - After having the Laphroaig triplewood I was excited to give this a go. I know they are from different regions but there were some similarities due to the shared process style. This was not my favorite - ok at best.

- **Balvenie 14Yr Old Caribbean Rum Cask** - I had originally intended to skip this one because I expected an overwhelming spiciness due to the rum cask but my friend at the show recommended it and I am SO glad he did. This was delicious.

- **Maker's 46** - Maker's seems to want a little more respect and are after in with the 46. I will now give them a little more respect. This was good. Not great but good.

- **Booker's** - this is the second time I've tried Booker's. Probably the last.

- **Compass Box Whisky Co: Peat Monster** - I really liked this scotch.The peat smell was overwhelming at first, even off putting but the sip was great! Then the finish was soft and smooth. It was surprise from beginning to end. I hope to buy a bottle at some point.

- **Compass Box Whisky: Orangerie** - Tried this on a whim and I'm also glad I did. It was very smooth, very sweet and as orange-y as it was scotch-y. Yuengling is my standard beer but Corona is my summer beer. Along those lines I don't think Orangerie could be my everyday scotch but it would make a hell of a good summer scotch.

- **Crown Royal Cask 16** - I wanted to try a Canadian and I'm glad it was this one. Really enjoyable, I'd like to try it again.

- **Samaroli (the entire line)** - This stuff was really complex, maybe too much so for a novice like me. I could tell it was good and incredibly well crafted but I think I was out of my depth with it. That said I did enjoy it. I'll put it this way, when I asked people at the show what not to miss most of them said Samaroli. I think I both did and didn't miss it. Will try again if given the opportunity.


I think there were a few more whiskeys that I tried though these stood out the most. I also got to sample some great tequilas and rums. I will do everything in my power to make sure I go back next year! It was a fantastic event but my wonderful whiskey week did not end there...


On Saturday I went to Time, a whiskey bar on 13th and Sansom in philly. The place was really cool and I can't wait to go back and spend a few hours there trying out some of my favs. This time though, I had a glass of the **Pappy Van Winkle 12 Year** which was caramel and butter deliciousness - everything it is hyped up to be. I will be buying a bottle of any Van Winkle that I can find and afford!

I come from the coffee industry knowing very little about alcohol especially whiskey but one thing I learned through coffee is that there is a lot to appreciate about drinks of single origins as opposed to blends whether it's a single-estate coffee bean or a single malt whiskey. Trying to get into appreciating whiskey more but my experience and pallate are still quite limited. I have a few questions and hopefully I won't sound too naive:

1. How the heck do I pronounce Glenfiddich and Glenlivet?

2. I've been buying small bottles every now and then just to try something new. First I tried Alberta Premium Rye Whiskey and that was pretty neat in some cocktails then I tried Ballentine's Finest and I've been thoroughly disappointed. That being said, is there a resource I could use to discover/learn more about whiskeys before I buy them as opposed to just randomly buying them and hoping for the best?

3. What is the most appropriate way to store whiskey after opening? I have a bottle of Glenlivet that is about half-full(empty) and was wondering if keeping it in the bottle at room temp is ideal.

Ok, so maybe not your run of the mill existential issue, but nonetheless, I felt it challenged what I thought of myself as a drinker. Here I was after about 10 years of thinking I only liked Scotch, but here in my hand, rising to my nose were the notes of caramel, vanilla and oak. A soft inviting scent, I salivated with the thought sipping. Yet, what ho!? This was a glass of American Pre-prohibition Style whiskey! Could it be, could I actually be enjoying a glass of American Whiskey? Turns out, yes, yes I could!

Leopold Bros stands up to my palate while at the same time requiring more attention. By no means do I have a developed palate, but I'm working on it. This spirit continues to surprise me, the depth and complexity are wonderous. Each glass I have I grab something new from the experience.

As noted above, there are soft notes in the nose, oak, caramel, vanilla, and they persist to the palate as well. Quickly following is the spice of the alcohol. It is very alcohol forward, but if one sniffs at it, you get past the alcohol, and start peeling back the layers. This is a continuing love affair and as I taste more this will most certainly be updated with more thoughts and revelations.

For now however, suffice to say that I am going to continue on my quest of figuring out if I do in fact appreciate American whiskey as well as Scotch.

The flavour is very strong and all I really notice is strong alcohol. I have found that I'm not very good at drinking any alcohol in general.

So why am I here? I'm really curious about the enjoyment of whiskey and I wish I did enjoy it since it seems people that love it, really love it. I'm wondering if whiskey is something you just have to enjoy the first few times you try it to know that it is for you or if anyone had a similar beginning as me. Did you ever feel like it was very unappealing but ended up loving it after either trying it enough times or learning something important about how to enjoy it properly?"	t5_2r06y	True

Anyone have any suggestions?


Also, back home in TX, I have a bottle of Crown Royal XR, and JAck Daniels single barrel.

So we would like to gift my father whiskey and would like to invest sth. about 150 €. I read around in this subreddit looking for good ones and this is my choice:

Redbreast 15y (http://www.whisky.de/shop/Irland/Redbreast-15J-2011--.html)
Jameson Gold (http://www.whisky.de/shop/Irland/Jameson-Gold--.html)
Glenlivet 18y (http://www.whisky.de/shop/Schottland/Glenlivet-18-Jahre--.html)


Now i'm asking myself are they a good choice? Do they taste different? Because we would like to give him different and new tastes, so he can see what he likes.

My mom tells me he has got a Laphroig 15y and a Bruich Laddich at home. Are these simlar to the three I chose? 

Just interested in your thoughts about the whole thing.

1) I'm in Ontario, it has to be available at the [LCBO](http://lcbo.ca). I'm around Toronto though so the selection is pretty much the best.  
2) I've already tried 40 creek and crown royal, it's okay I suppose.  
3) Price limit is $60 - $70, I don't mind spending a bit of cash on a good bottle.  

Give me what you got!

EDIT: Based on the two recommendations below I ended up getting Booker's! Hopefully this is the right one (sorry for shitty sideways phone pic): http://i.imgur.com/KnI81.jpg

64.3% is pretty strong, but I've previously experimented with overproof rums (Stroh 80, Wray &amp; Nephew, Sunset rum which is 84.5%..), so I think I'll be okay..

It smells good, I'll report back in 2 - 3 hours after I have a glass or two.

EDIT 2: About half way through my second glass (I didn't measure by shots but I'd say I've had around 2oz - 3oz. by now?), this was a very enjoyable drink and I look forward to future weekends with it. Although I don't know much about this stuff, I will say it wasn't as harsh as I expected and the flavor definitely sticks out to me more than the alcohol which I really like.
