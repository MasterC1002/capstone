They even got the cabinetry in the average office pretty accurate! They didn't cut corners, they put Frank in a home that looks like the wealthy homes in DC, Zoe in an apartment that looks right for a low-income on the Yellow line, the looks of the shopfronts, and more. I can find small gripes here and there, but in all it's fantastic.

""Power is a lot like real estate. It's all about location, location, location. The close you are to the source, the higher your property value."" - Frank Underwood

""How quickly poor grades vanish in the shadow of power and wealth"" - Frank Underwood

""And then he asked if I had no faith in God. I said, 'No you have it wrong. It's God who has no faith in us'"" - Frank Underwood

""It's degrading I know, but when the tit's that big, everyone gets in line."" - Frank Underwood (Episode 2) 

""I'm not going to lie. I despise children. There, I've said it."" - Frank Underwood  (Episode 9)

""They say dad's going to O.D. like Amy Winehouse."" - Kevin Russo (Episode 9) 

""I almost pity him. He didn't ask to be put on my platter. When I carve him up and toss him to the dogs, only then will he confront that brutal, inescapable truth: 'My God, all I ever amounted to was chitlins.'"" - Frank Underwood

""You see, Freddy believes that if a fridge falls off a minivan, you better swerve out of its way. I believe it's the fridge's job to swerve out of mine."" - Frank Underwood (Episode 4)

“Such a waste of time. He chose money over power, in this town, a mistake nearly everyone makes. Money is the McMansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after ten years. Power — is the old stone building that stands for centuries. I cannot respect someone who doesn’t see the difference.” - Frank Underwood

“There are two kinds of pain, the sort of pain that makes you strong, or the useless pain, the sort of pain that’s only suffering.” - Frank Underwood

""After all, we are nothing more or less than we choose to reveal."" - Frank Underwood

""Every Tuesday I sit down with the Speaker and the Majority Leader to discuss the week's agenda. Well, ""discuss"" is probably the wrong word...they talk, while I imagine their lightly-salted faces, frying in a skillet.""  - Frank Underwood

""You may despise me Oren, but the classy thing to do would have been to invite us up for some of that iced tea."" - Frank Underwood

""You show up at my house in the middle of the night, drunk. To whine. To try to shift the blame on me instead of taking responsibility for yourself and your own actions? Maybe they were right about you. Maybe you are worthless. I'm the only person who believes in you Peter, but maybe that's one too many."" Frank Underwood to Peter Russo

""Most people see fear as a weakness. It can be. Sometimes for my job, I have to put fear into people. I know it's not right, but if I'm honest, like the 4 Steps asks us to be, I have to be ruthless. Because failure is not an option. The same goes for my sobriety. I have to be ruthless with myself. I have to use my fear. It makes me stronger.""  - Doug Stamper

""If I didn't think you were such a liability to yourself congressman, I might even like you."" - New York Times reporter to Peter Russo
""If your circulation were as high as the Wall St. Journal, I might like you back."" - Peter Russo in response.

Speculation is a poor form of investment and an equally poor form of politics."" - Raymond Tusk to Frank Underwood

""I pray to myself, for myself."" - Frank Underwood

""I won't be a slave to anyone or anything you can order with a toll free number."" 
- Frank Underwood

""What am I, a whore in post-war Berlin salivating over free stockings and chocolate?"" - Frank Underwood

""You want me to say those three magic words, one of which starts with an 'L'. Ok. I'll say it. Christina, lick my balls."" - Peter Russo

Underwood: I'm sorry Mr. President but I will not do that.

President: Are you letting pride cloud you judgement, Frank?

Underwood: Respectfully sir, you are letting fear cloud yours.

""If I was gonna fuck you, you'd know it."" - Zoe Barnes

""I love that woman, I love her more than sharks love blood."" - Frank Underwood

The metaphor and analogy and fourth wall usage there is astonishing. Most of the time, we just skip past the credits because they're not important, they're an afterthought, we just want what we want. We want the show, we don't care who made it. In that way, we're like Francis. We don't care about all the work behind it, and the show inextricably ties that to us. Tapping that all-too-common glazing over credits, and associating it with Frank's true lack of care and compassion for murdering a man.  

More or less: We don't care about the credits. We just want what we want. Frank doesn't/didn't care about Russo. He just wants what he wants. Absolutely amazing. "	t5_2t3ft	True

I really felt that the dialogue was alluding to some sort of sexual history between Frank and his pal. ""Pleasing you"" and ""Yeah, but have you got somebody special?"" and the ""Come chill and let's go boating alone wink wink"", really made me feel Frank was either gay or at least bisexual. The friend seemed to have some hardcore longing for Frank, and Frank, seemed too intensely into his job to even be willing to put something as dumb as lust before his career. As we know we haven't had many if any openly gay politicians in high places. I really liked it and I don't care if it comes back or not, but I was wondering if any of you read it that way too.

We all know the one. As it played out and it became evidence what was happening, I instantly began questioning the reliability of Russo sitting in the passenger seat. As the camera zoomed in on Frank's mouth as his lullaby escaped his lips, and he wiped all his prints off of everything, I was wondering if he was gonna move Russo to the driver's side. 

When it comes to a suicide, something like shifting over into the passenger's seat before kicking back and passing out seems pretty implausible. If my mind went straight for that thought, surely some of you did too, and surely there would have been an investigation? Perhaps it'll come back to bite someone in the ass. "	t5_2t3ft	True

1376439339.0	1kbdco	Is President Walker more dangerous/savvy than he has so far appeared? *SPOILERS*	WakizashiNomad	42	1	9	For most of season 1, Walker appears to be a relatively weak leader who was likely elected due to powerful allies / personal charisma, and leaves most of his important objectives to Frank and Linda. However, in the last 2 episodes, it is revealed that he's closely connected, both personally and financially, to Raymond Tusk, and that Tusk ordered him to take the only major action he has in the whole series: betray Frank. It now appears that while there is more to Walker than we thought, he's still only a pawn in Tusk's grand scheme involving nuclear energy; however, do you think it's possible that he's actually a more dangerous, active player than he appears, and has been playing Frank more than Frank realizes?

1361561072.0	191chu	Is Frank afraid of Remy ? (spoilers all)	cmdrNacho	43	5	20	"I think Remy is a great villain.  We have the classic protoge/mentor relationship.  The series starts with Frank trying to avoid Remy due to his loss of the Secretary of State.  Their first encounter Remy goes as far as threatening Frank with the lines ""Don't make them throw money at your challenger"".  Remy attempts to seduce Frank's wife at one point, works with Frank's wife to undermine what Frank is trying to do with Russo, seems to be following Frank at many times during the series.. keeping an eye on him, and even directly crosses Frank when Frank asks for San Corp's help, along with directly telling Tusk of Frank's plan.  Frank quotes ""Such a waste of talent, he chose money over power"".. but we know Remy is clearly positioning himself for the money and power especially after his dealings with Tusk.  Frank appears to always underestimate Remy's power.  We all know Remy is as intelligent and as manipulative as Frank, he did learn from the best.  So why hasn't Frank even attempted to retaliate against Remy at any point ?  Is he really afraid of what Remy and San-corp can do ?  When Claire is first approached about San-corp's donation to her charity, Frank almost does sound fearful in that he doesn't want to be owing them any debts and to tells Clarie to stay away, they'll do it on their own.  Is it out of his past relationship with Remy ?  Is it because Frank is to focused on his other goals ?  

tldr:  Why doesn't Frank do anything against Remy ?

He cheats on his wife, but it's fine to me because she's doing it too.

Excellent work all around - only a few parts in the entire season was I rolling my eyes or wanting to skip ahead.  Usually those parts dealt with Russo - won't spoil it but I'm sure many of you will know what parts I am talking about when you get there.

I'm not much of a fan of sex scenes in TV shows/movies - as often they seem crammed in there.  Fortunately, the series did not overdo them.  They happened every once in a while, they were usually quick scenes to just let you know people were getting it on, and then they moved on with the plot.  It was a breath of fresh air as often shows that include such things break the pace with their sex scenes.

It may sound silly, but he really was the protagonist in season one. He was a flawed guy who came from the streets and just wanted to help out the people he grew up with...how could you not love that?

Francis is the focus of the show, and i absolutely love his character, but I really can't align with him... he is all about stature and power. Zoe I could give to shits about, although I can identify with her struggling to get her career off the ground. The other characters really dont do anything for me...really, Russo drove season one for me.

I hated Russo in the first couple of episodes, but he really grew on me. He was the audience's ""Everyman"". We could identify with his struggles and he started as a congressman with no ambition to a guy gunning for Governor...

...Then, Russo gets involved in Francis' world and its game over. The sad part is that Russo was just another pawn, but his character was weak, and the he should have seen the set-up from a mile away. Also sort of reminded me of the dog that frank killed in the first episode, because honestly, Russo probably would have killed himself anyway.

It will be interesting who plays the ""Everyman"" in season 2 now that Russo is gone. Perhaps Francis will get knocked down a peg or two, and he will be our ""Everyman""? I don't know...

We don't really know what her motivations are. Her relationship with Frank is also pretty ambiguous. We don't get to see a lot of her thinking or her actions.

In fact we don't even know what exactly Frank thinks or feels about her. There have been very few times when Frank has spoken about Claire.

I think Season 2 will focus on her a lot more and give us a better perspective on the significance of a lot of the other events (like the graveyard scene, homeless man scene, her relationship with Adam etc.)

The greatest epitome of this attitude is when Underwood goes up to that homeless guy outside the Capitol and tells him that no one cares about what he has to scream about. Or when Underwood fakes sympathy towards a dead girl's parents to persuade them from suing the local municipal government. 

Furthermore, the show depicts regular people (like Russo's hooker, the teachers) as a mob that can be easily intimidated or simply bought off with money or food without any consequence to the people at the top whatsoever.

I've seen the British version so I know what Urquhart does and Underwood's actions are very similar and I'm super excited to see how Netflix will translate To Play the King and The Final Cut into Washington DC.

Spoilers for UK HOC and US HOC S1 and possible S2 spoilers below.

Something that irked me a bit about the way Underwood dealt with Russo was how hands off it was - it was a lot more passive and opportunistic rather than planned as was Urquhart's murder of O'Neill, whose cocaine he laced with rat poison.

I'm hoping that Francis deals with Zoe in a much more hands-on way to make up for that. In UK HOC, Urquhart kills his problem journalist (Mattie Storin) by throwing her off of the roof of the House of Commons roof garden, an area which he goes to to calm down and think and be alone - it's his place of peace.

Underwood relieves the stress of his machiavellian ways by gaming and also by using his rowing machine... One of the first times he meets with Zoe, Underwood says something along the lines of how he could only save himself from drowning. He's speaking metaphorically there of course, but I think it's possible that Underwood might drown Zoe, which IMO more than makes up for the passive killing of Russo as I'm fairly sure that Zoe will put up a fight and Underwood will have to actively be killing her.

That's how I think Underwood will kill Zoe.

I'm not entirely sure how closely US HOC will follow UK HOC, but UK HOC S2 (To Play the King) puts Urquhart, who is now serving as Prime Minister, against the King who causes a constitutional crisis when he all but declares his support for the Labour Party (as opposed to Urquhart's Conservative Party) and essentially campaigns for them which he is not supposed to do.

I'm from the UK, so I don't get all the US's political news, so I'd like to ask how often the Vice-President and President are likely to disagree with each other on something? I think that in S2 we're going to see a lot of conflict between Underwood and Walker, with Walker ultimately resigning the office and causing Underwood to come to power without having to be elected. This is how Urquhart comes to power in UK HOC and as we're currently a way off an election in the US HOC timeline I can't see any other way Underwood would come to be the President, which I am certain he will."	t5_2t3ft	True

Meanwhile, the CWI, the origami, her now suddenly wanting a baby all seem like things she's after to fill the void inside of her so she can convince herself she's left a mark on this world before she dies. It reminds me this [song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RDUjA0fN4o).  And there's her past, her mother who was only considered with her smiling and looking beautiful. 

It seems this might lead to a conflict of interests later on with Francis practically heading off in the other direction of his growing embrace of his villainy. 

Robin Wright is phenomenal and perfectly cast, I also liked her in GWTD where she played Erika Berger (incidentally a character who is similarly open with her sexuality)

I wonder: Will their relationship ever be placed in jeopardy? If they ever end up at odds with one another, would Claire be willing to remove herself from Francis or will she be loyal to the end?Would Francis ever be willing to cut Claire to achieve his endgoals? Or will she end up being his Achille's heal?

That's an awesome way of describing two kinds of people, I think the second one fits only in big mental players like Frank.

When Frank asks for the two extra tickets, he makes sure the seats next to him are empty so his face is seen more on camera. Because as he points out years down the road when it is time to elect a new president people pay attention to the faces who are at the front.

I think this really points out Franks complete and total manipulation of everything around him. I also noticed many other subtle manipulations, but that one really stuck out at me.

Also I might be grasping at straws here, but he could have been purposely checking out Zoey. After all he admitted he already knew about two of her articles. Maybe he set up someone with a camera to take a picture and ""catch"" him in the act, and then send it to Zoey's blog.  Because he knows that she has her own aspirations to get out of the rut of small time journalism she will take the bait and come to him."	t5_2t3ft	True

Where's my last episode?  I feel like every plot got to the 98 yard line and then stopped.

I know the conventional wisdom is to leave them wanting more, but this is different.

1360430966.0	18775e	Some of my thoughts after watching through... [spoilers]	krosork	25	2	18	"Wasn't Underwood's plan for Russo sloppy, in a way?  I understood it, I think:  redeem Peter, convince him to run, pass the water bill and sway the VP to give Peter some serious hope of winning, and then bring in the temptation and hopefully he'll bite.  Stamper put it best, though, before they ended up tempting him early - there's no telling how Peter would react to it.  If they'd have waited, would it have been easier to predict how Russo would respond to the hooker?  Do you think there's anything Frank would've brought in to make it more tempting?

Again about Russo, I think Frank too easily assumed that he had total control over him.  It seems out of character that he wouldn't have predicted that Peter would use the Kaperniak thing against him, eventually.  I was disappointed in Frank's only contingency plan for this being murder, but it was still a powerful scene.

Also, did anyone else think that the coolest scene in the whole show so far was the church scene?  Specifically the line about ""our mutual distain"", while looking directly into the camera.  I couldn't help but feel as though he was addressing both God and the audience, because by that point I truly hated Frank, and I doubt he'd feel any differently towards me."	t5_2t3ft	True

He establishes a plan early in the series to ""devour the whale one piece at a time."" By the end of the season, Frank is in place to take over the station of VP, through a ruthless plot involving Russo and Matthews.

It seems that Frank's plan all along is to leverage the importance of the PA special election to maneuver his way to where he is at the end of episode 13. This means he needed Matthews to step down from VP to govern PA. To achieve this, he needed to create a crisis within that campaign. To achieve that, he managed Russo's campaign to hold off any other prospective candidates and then tanked it on purpose leaving the DNC with too little time to groom someone new.

He flies off the handle at Claire for her betrayal on the Water Shed bill, stating that they had a specific time table they needed to fulfill, i.e. keeping Russo viable up until the last minute. The DRWA was a big part of keeping Russo viable. However, after the DRWA is defeated, Frank quickly sets up Russo at the gala with Rachel the prostitute. He doesn't seem to maneuver at all to prolong Russo's campaign viability and simply decides to proceed with the sabotage phase. Why was he so angry at Claire for pushing up the timetable if he so quickly destroyed Russo anyway? Am I interpreting the plot incorrectly? Did he even need the DRWA to pass, or did he just need it to make Russo seem viable up until the vote? If that's the case, why did he even care that the bill was defeated?"	t5_2t3ft	True
1360770724.0	18g6ul	Confusion about Frank's scheme [Spoilers up to Ep. 13]	diamond	21	4	19	"OK, so I just finished Season 1 last night, and I really enjoyed it. This is a remarkably intricate and well-run show; I can't wait to see where they go with S2.

But there's one thing that's bothering me.

Throughout the season, we have seen Frank slowly build up his plan, manipulating anyone who could help, destroying anyone who got in his way, and generally being a brilliant son of a bitch. In the last few episodes, we saw his plan finally come to a head and it was revealed that his ultimate end goal was a VP nomination. And Zoe seems to have finally realized that as well. But a couple of steps along the way seem to contradict that conclusion.

Let's work backwards through this. Frank has been offered the VP slot because Matthews is stepping down to run for his old Gubernatorial seat. Matthews had to step down because of Russo's flameout and death. Russo imploded because Frank drove him back into the bottle, because Russo was becoming a loose cannon and threatening to destroy Frank. Russo was doing that because he was pissed off that Frank had failed to secure the Watershed Act, which would have helped him win the Governor's race. And, of course, that happened because Claire turned against Frank, and we all remember how Frank reacted to that.

And that's the problem. If Frank was aiming for the VP nomination, then why was he pissed off when Claire scuttled the Watershed Act? If she hadn't done that, it would have passed and Russo would have had a good shot at the Gubernatorial election. If Russo won the election, Matthews would stay where he was, and there would be no need to nominate a new VP.

I suppose it's possible that Frank had a different plan to destroy Russo before the election, forcing the outcome that we saw. But if that was the case, there was no reason for him to push so hard for the Watershed Act, and there was certainly no reason for him to be angry at Claire for undermining it. If anything, she gave him the perfect opportunity to accomplish his goal.

The only thing I can figure is that Frank originally had a different plan, which would have required a controllable Russo as PA governor. But when things went to shit for Russo, he quickly changed course and decided that the Vice Presidency would be a decent alternative. If that's the case, I'd love to know what his original plan was; maybe we'll learn more about that in S2."	t5_2t3ft	True

He has the qualities for success and the predisposition for accomplishments we all strive for, but his evil is beyond unforgiving. Yet, I feel compelled to root for him; to wish for a get away.
The blood on his hand drips across the capitol floor, and through the lives of many, and yet he still manages to disguise this trail. And upon up-close inspection his hands are fucking pristine.
The scene at the church just reveals to me how lost of a man he really is. Not because he doesn't believe in God or Devil, for believing or disbelieving in either of those two things never make or break a man. But his prayer, there was anguish in his voice, desperation, a battled demeanor, even when he prayed to Satan. The whole scene blew me away. I felt compelled to help him, guide him through this labyrinthic mess he himself created. It reminded me of Walter White, a man so attached to his conviction, that everything he does to get ahead makes him despise himself even more. 
I don't know what to expect of Underwood, I know he will find a way to get out, to survive, and I want goodness for him. I don't want punishment. Yet I know this man will never find solace or redemption. And there is no jail time, or religion, or anything at all left for this man to find refuge. 
His wife is as conniving and cold-hearted as he is, and their whimsical, egotistical legacy it's quickly consume, like shooting up a heroin, getting a high, and wanting more. Insatiable addicts. 
The things they do together are for immediate remuneration. No friends, no love, just dedication, goals, thirst for power. And the legacy that comes from it is just a trail of destruction that sucks them deeper into a black hole. I feel sorry for them...I feel like I could kill them myself, but yet, I have nothing but compassion...why?? Why? I know its fictional and entertaining...and you want to the protagonist (or antagonist) to get away and everyone to live happily ever after...yet the show's so real I can think but for their demise as the only way out...

There is no good v. evil narrative here.  This story happens inside the machine that produces the hero/villain news narrative.  There's no heroic team to join here.  There is only a collection of power-seekers navigating their own relationships with (barely) themselves and (mainly) the power game with others they play.

Having just finished episode 13, I see clearly the absence of a YAY Left/Right BOO Right/Left narrative.  In its place is a 13-hour exposition of the structure of power.

1360431400.0	1877l9	Frank, Claire and Children (SPOILERS)	AndrewJacksonSwagger	19	4	21	"I haven't seen many people talk about this theme, what it means to have children, in House of Cards and that's because it doesn't crop up until the later episodes but I really loved the dimension that this brought to Frank and Claire.

One of my favorite admissions of Claire's character is when she tells her Doctor that she's had 3 abortions. It's said so casually and left as such a mystery that it really stuck with me. We have no clue if those abortions involved Frank or not. Knowing how much Frank didn't want kids it kind of surprises me he would never get his tubes tied.

To continue with things I loved about Claire is when she shacks up with the photographer. At first I thought it was stupid, mainly because I think he's an opportunistic jerk eager to exploit other people's misery for ""art"", but I came around when they were both looking at the photo of the woman in the park. It really drove home the idea that in some other world Claire had chosen the artist over the politician. 

I also loved the juxtaposition of Gillian's pregnancy and her drives with Frank and Claire's. (Total Sidebar: I can't be the only one that thought Claire was trying to seduce Gillian, right? I maybe a horndog but I sincerely thought this show was going to go down a very Clinton-esque path.) It really brings out how much Frank blindly wants power for himself, which if he had I'm not sure he would even know what to do with. I'm reminded of Rob Delaney talking about what if Mitt Romney had won and how Mitt would sit in the Oval Office and say ""Well, I'm President now. This is just swell"" as he stared off into space doing nothing.

I'm sure having children and a pregnancy will play into next season. I can see Frank using it to his political advantage, whether it's to blow one story out of the water or to make him seem more like a real human. Then again we could be in for a particularly nasty miscarriage angle. We already know this show doesn't play nice."	t5_2t3ft	True

Besides obvious product placement (""is THAT a PS VITA?!  I should get one!""), is it a subtle hint at his character?  a more violent, sadistic side?  Or maybe to showcase his immaturity?  

I'd love to hear your thoughts.

It seems like contrived writing to get him to go back to his home town. Maybe that is how lame politics are, but blaming a structure for a death is downright absurd...and him leaving the education meeting for it seemed even sillier.

So I'm in my second watching of the season and I noticed something strange. At the beginning of the first episode, when Frank loses his shot at the Secretary of State job, he makes his plan, which works out over the next twelve episodes. The only issue for me is, in order for Frank to be considered for VP, the current VP would have to be out of the picture, and the only way that could be done is by sending him back to Pennsylvania to resume his role as governor. For that to happen, Frank needed a candidate from Pennsylvania to fall out of the race. The only reason Peter becomes Frank's pawn is because of his DUI in episode one, and his solicitation of a prostitute. If Peter hadn't been pulled over that night, Doug never could have gotten him out of jail, and they wouldn't have a governor candidate. Before the get their hands on Peter, they were looking for their ""buffer."" If this had not happened, Frank's plan could not have worked. Or am I missing something?"	t5_2t3ft	True

AndroidKim	12	2	8	As I watch the series and observe Frank's character, I see some parallels between his plotline and those of characters Kevin Spacey has played in the past.  For example, his duplicitous nature and how he masterfully pulls the wool over everyone's eyes while setting his plans into motion reminds me of his narrative in the Usual Suspects as Verbal Kint/Keyser Soze.  His fascination with the much-younger Zoe and his tenuous marriage to Claire ([and her infidelity](/spoiler)) remind me of his obsession with Angela and his relationship with Carolyn, respectively, in American Beauty.  The scene where [Peter Russo barges into his apartment after he's forced to not testify against the closing of the shipyard](/spoiler) reminds me of the recurring scene in Swimming with Sharks when Guy tries to exact revenge on Buddy at his home, only to have to have the tables turned against him.

Frank is motivated by power, he wants more of it, he wants all of it, but what exactly does he want to do with it.

I could not believe a new vice president who just got elected less than a year ago would leave the post to become Gov again. No matter how persuasive Frank can be, this was just an eyerolling sequence that I didnt buy in the slightest. 

Also I understand Peter was a huge liability and was possibly going to out Frank the next morning so maybe Frank really had no choice but to do what he did to Peter, but I feel Frank was maybe being a bit too risky in doing it. there are so many people who now have to shush up in order for Frank to not get blood on his hands: Rachel has to keep quiet, The cops who saw Peter must keep quiet, the police commish. Also Christina should have been a little more suspicious at Doug than the show showed. Peter calls her late in the night in distress, so she calls Doug and then the next thing she hears is that Peter is dead. She doesnt even know for sure that Peter wasnt there when Doug arrived. Also how was Frank certain there was no security cams in Peters complex that could easily show there were two people driving in the car?

Maybe I am nitpicking and this is a good sign since up until this show everything flowed so naturally and beautifully for me.

At one point, Zoe theorizes: ""Maybe he wanted Russo to self-destruct to force Matthews to run, so Underwood could be tapped for V.P.""

This may be true - and in that case, his plan totally worked.

But there was one element to his plan that DIDN'T work the way he wanted: the watershed bill getting defeated. (""I wanna know who lied."") He didn't predict that. And if the bill HADN'T been defeated, Russo probably wouldn't have gone off the deep end like that.

Well, on the surface he had to support it obviously, but his plan came to fruition only because it failed and destroyed Russo. And yet he can't have been consciously subverting it since he was furious with Claire for her treachery.  If they'd gone home and celebrated their deception that night, it would all make sense.  But instead he drove her away to the photographer, almost for good.

If this is explained in the last episode, please, just tell me to hold on until tomorrow.

Don't get me wrong, a part of me does go out to Russo. He got used, made to look foolish and incompetent publicly and was forced to betray those he loved the most and we're to thank for his position to begin with, and then was murdered, and even in death, he is made to look bad, a coward.

But now it appears that its been released in HD on some devices(Apple TV)? Initially when I and a friend tried to watch last night the HD option on netflix was not available. He is a subscriber, i am not. I searched online for this and found nothing about the initial launch being SD only. Anyone have the same experience or know anything?

Also doesn't it make more sense from a business standpoint to release this show on a weekly basis, like a normal serial show? I mean I'm not complaining that I can marathon the whole thing in a day but from the POV of netflix this was a bad move. You sign up for a free month, watch the show and cancel. You don't pay anything. Or they can release all 13 episodes of the course of 2-3 months weekly and guarantee that people pay for at least 1-2 months of service with them.

3) Episode 1 - Incredible start, everyone's character is tight, and popping.

Now I don't even want to watch the next episode. (If you haven't watched Ep. 4 yet, here's your cue to close this before I spoil the events of the episode.)

Why is our intrepid reporter fucking the congressman? The whole flirtatious texting sequence in the previous episode felt a bit forced, but Underwood played it off. This event seems to have been shoehorned into the plot for no other reason than the Supermodel Journalist Chick needs to hook up with the Main Character.

It bothers me because I don't see the motivation. These people are supposed to be too cunning to engage in a dangerous affair simply because it excites them. They're supposed to be playing each other, the way Claire used her photographer and the way Zoe used Frank to get national exposure and a great new job.

Peter Russo... what happened?  I hate Francis for using him like that, Russo was a good guy.  Ugh... What happened?  I was sure we were going to find him dead in the bathtub with his wrists slit.  But it seems like he ran away somehow.  Anyone else have any thoughts on this?

Zoe... Zoe and Francis' relationship was getting to be really weird, and Lucas seems nice... I don't know what to expect here.  I really hope Francis stops using Zoe for sex, but I think we all know that's not going to happen.

Claire... Her turning on Francis seemed a bit out of character, but who knows.  All I know is that I hate her for it, everyone would have been happy and perfect if it wasn't for that.  Also, Adam Galloway creeps me out.

Linda Vasquez... What does Francis want from her?  Any thoughts?  He went through a lot of trouble to get in her good graces.

Charter schools and teacher evaluation make more sense, but these still are not the hallmarks of education reform for the moderate democrats.

His machinations and motivations have a driven purpose to them, and I enjoyed watching his story unfold.

Sadly I can't say the same for Claire and am wondering if I missed something in her story. I don't have a problem with her acting, but instead the arc of her story and its relevance. When the series started out I assumed that the CWI would be a front for a nefarious operation that F and C had set up together, which was why Claire was pushing for an international presence at the CWI when Frank was going to be Sec State. 

I never got the sense that she truly cared about the mission of the CWI and that she treated it sort of like a pet hobby. I actually remain uncertain of its purpose. Then halfway through the series she sabotages both her husband and Russo (whom she had given no indication of ill will) over a minor issue of some water filters, knowing it would come back to her. Then she is in the wind hooking up with some creepy dude in NYC and finally returns to D.C. and starts having baby lust. Her entire story just seems tangential to the MASSIVE coup her husband has been orchestrating and it makes me wonder if I missed a key scene somewhere.

1372378834.0	1h7ruq	[All Spoilers] Just finished season 1... so this is how I think the series will end...	Alexis_Black	1	2	2	"Working backwards: Last scene will be Claire being elected to congress, or asked to run for congress, after Frank is assassinated by Edward Meechum who becomes completely unbalanced after learning that the brick incident was a hoax by Frank.  (Seriously, just firing a gun at a fleeing victim in a residential neighbourhood... forget the entirely valid stray bullet issue; what if there was another armed guy or twelve at the back door... shittiest bodyguard ever).

Before that: Claire is placed in some situation where she can either save Gillian and her baby or not (maybe a private showdown where Gillian falls and is at a risk of miscarrying) and chooses not to help wherein Gillian and the baby die as a result -- thereby making her as bad or worse than Franks actions with Russo.

Also: Stamper becomes attached to, and identifies with, Rachel to such an extent that she is in someway hurt by Frank, he is the one to tell Meetchum that the brick was a hoax.  He either dies or runs off with Rachel... maybe Frank demands his time and he wasn't there to help Rachel in some crisis and as a result Rachel gets hurt or dies and -- as he comes to understand that they are both essentially damaged individuals selling their services in different forms -- his chance at salvation is lost, he falls off the wagon, and betrays Frank (i.e. becomes a good guy at last as Frank is a straight up fucking murderer no matter how complex, interesting, and endearing).

If the second (final) season was shot prior to the Red Wedding, possible murders and deaths will be injuries.  If it was shot after... it will be as close to a bleak Shakespearean tragedy as a drama set in modern times will allow.

As for Lucas and Zoe, she's going to fuck the relationship up by sleeping with Frank ""one last time"" for who knows what reason... I think ambition, but it'll probably be out of spite or somesuch.

The only one coming out ahead in the whole thing will be Janine, whose work ethic, experience, and single-mindedness will keep her safe... unless it doesn't.

Oh yeah, Claire gets pregnant, the baby is Adam's but Frank doesn't know, she miscarries and Frank isn't there thereby killing her abiding devotion to him once and for all.

Cheers,
Alexis

The show itself is a metaphor for both of these. Netflix delivering instant video is similar to newspapers delivering online information. Netflix is trying to prove that online information will become more important than cable television, like Zoe is trying to prove online information is more important than print. Everyone knows that hard print/cable television without an online option is dying, netflix and zoe represent the inner drive to fully take the step past the cable giants/written newspaper.


Frank is Netflix. While Frank has some power as whip, he'd like to have more. Netflix has established itself to be viable and has some power, but it would like to have more. Frank's plan to slowly ascend to power is like Netflix's plan to slowly produce viable show options. As House of Cards gains more praise and Netflix gains more power and influence so does Frank slowly ascend through the ranks until he/Netflix have power to influence.

I understand his initial desire to bail Peter out in order to have a congressman in his back pocket... i.e. allowing him to close the shipyard without protest. However, I don't see the value in spending such a large amount of time and resources in putting him in the governor's office.

Would it be that useful to have the governor of Pennsylvania be loyal to him? (sorry if they explained this specifically) Also, doesn't he lose his leverage over Peter if his governership platform involves exposing his past history of drugs and prostitution, since that specifically is the blackmail Frank has against him?

When Frank goes to visit Zoe at the end of the episode, she has a bottle of wine but no wine opener, so Frank asks for a pen to open it.  As best I can tell, he then jams the pen into the cork, and rams it through the bottle with his shoe.  He leaves the pen on the table but there's no sign of the cork.

He then pours two glasses (perhaps to conceal that he corked it?).  When Zoe takes a sip, she notices that it's turned, takes the glasses, and pours them out.  This leads into the discussion about the spider/landlord and she makes the call to her father at Frank's urging.  Yada yada yada oral sex.

The US version ended on a cliffhanger. 

I'm honestly upset about this, as I feel they really didn't nail down Frank as a wholly evil man. Even Peter's death seemed a bit like putting a bad dog down instead of a sociopathic removal of a threat. 

I think stopping where they did left it like the first season of Lost - a feeling of ""this is going to be good, let's see where it goes."" If they'd actually gotten to Zoe's death and completed his swearing in as VP, the first season would be a complete work and it would be more ""Holy shit that was incredible I cannot wait to see more""

And having said that, the thing I've been wondering for a few episodes is if they're going to kill Zoe, or if they're going to wimp out and make her a constant thorn in Underwood's side. I really hope it's not the latter - killing the reporter was what really cemented Urquhart as evil with a capital e. "	t5_2t3ft	True
