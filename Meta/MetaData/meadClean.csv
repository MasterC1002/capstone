Now that that's out of the way, what do you guys think? A dedicated website were I will compile (it will be a wiki so you can add info too) and archive all the great information shared here on r/mead. I might even expand it to make it an actual organization (free to join) where you and I (and whomever) can post event ideas, gathering, etc. (you get the picture) AND! also host a variety of events like competitions and exchanges. The hosting will be necessary to facilitate registrations and the sort.

Well? What do you think?

:)

EDIT: will name it something on the lines of mead int. or mead guild or rmead something or meadopedia

Many more will be available throughout the year, so I'm passing my find on to you folks.	balathustrius	24	0	12	"I went to [Chiles Peach Orchard](http://www.chilespeachorchard.com/) near Crozet, VA to see what they had in the way of pick-your-own strawberries for a melomel. Well, strawberries are dreadfully late this year and the pickin's are slim so far, but as I was looking around their shop I saw a bushel basket full of one-gallon cider jugs for $1 each.

I bought all seven (for roughly the price of one such jug at my LHBS), and inquired why they have so many. Apparently, they make apple cider slushies and once the season really gets going, they go through several gallons a day. But they said that's nothing compared to their sister orchard, [Carter Mountain](http://www.cartermountainorchard.com/), in Charlottesville, which also sells the empties for $1 each.

If you want some one-gallon jugs and live nearby, check those websites, call ahead, and see if they'll set them aside for you. If you don't live nearby, check your own orchards as they open this year.

If you've never been around such a tree, they are *extremely* fragrant, and I found myself wondering what mountain laurel honey tastes like.

And although I've seen the bees hard at work, it occurred to me that I've never seen anyone selling that particular type of honey.  I figured maybe it was because mountain laurels only bloom for no more than three or four weeks, and maybe that wasn't long enough for bees to really make a lot of honey from it.  So I googled, and found articles like this:

[Mountain Laurel Honey](http://www.pickenscountyscbeekeepers.com/MLH.html)

Turns out bees *do* make honey from laurels, but the plant, and consequently the honey, contains an agent that is safe for bees but harmful to humans (and sheep apparently), causing weakness, nausea, and even *DEATH!*

Here are my first two attempts, both meads are really different but both very tasty.

**Pomelo Sweet Mead:**
Pomelo juice (aka Asian Grapefruit), Orange Blossom honey, green tea leaves, champagne yeast - 
[photo](http://distilleryimage7.s3.amazonaws.com/e7cff6d6810711e1b9f1123138140926_7.jpg) - 
Very sweet, a bit of the grapefruit bite but I was really careful of avoiding pith or too much oil from the skin when juicing the pomelos. Not bitter at all! Couldn't really taste the green tea.

**Sparking Dry Pear Mead:**
Fresh pear juice, tanin, Lalvin ICV D-47, wild Californian honey, water from boiled down blanched almonds - 
[photo](http://distilleryimage10.s3.amazonaws.com/0382345e868d11e18cf91231380fd29b_7.jpg) - 
Light amaretto smell, tastes like white wine with an after taste of that distinctive pear skin flavor.

I'm so pumped to make more now!

Boom!"	wtf81	21	1	20	"Just made a black currant and elderberry mead. OSG:1.18!

Recipe as follows:

* 24lbs raw virginia honey

* 2 gallons of black currant juice

* 96 oz can of elderberry juice

Bring up to 160F and pasteurize for about 45 min. 

Cool kettle in the tub and add: 

* 6 green Anjou/bartlett pears, sliced into various sizes
* 6 cinnamon sticks
* 6 palmfuls of black pepper corns
* 6 handfuls of raisins. 
* 9 whole cloves

Stir like hell and pitch the following:

* Monster double EC1118 starter with grape juice along with a third packet of 1118 dry at about 82 F

* Stir like hell again, for at least 45 seconds to aerate.

Results:

The airlock started working a mere 4 hours later. After 12 hours it was going batshit crazy. Over the last 24 hours or so I have had to refill the airlock twice. 

* Anticipated ABV+ 18-21%

This guy is started to get nice and golden. Next time I will definitely make this in a nylon straining bag. I'd like to rack this soon and strain the bottom crud out. This is my first batch and I combined a few recipes so I was kind of all over the place while getting it right. I've tasted it and it is definitely potent, but I can see that it will mellow out and be tasty. I think the starting SG was 1.08... I forgot to write it down as I did many other aspects of the brew process. Next time I will be more diligent! (maybe). Notes from my poorly ept brew log can be found below.

Oct 8: 

Roasted 4 pumpkin pie pumpkins, about 2.5 lbs each, halved, with 1/4 tsp PPS each. 
Didn't think I'd have enough pumpkin so I used 2 sweet potatoes as well, cut in half, about 1.1 lbs in total with  1/4 tsp PPS/half
Roasting Procedure: 425-350-400 deg F for about 2 hours, 425 seemed too high so I lowered it after about 30 mins. After an hour at 350 they still seemed tough so I upped the temp to 400. I usually cook sweet potatoes at 425 for 30-40 mins flipping half way. Might have to try this next time. The lack of oil seems to affect how the pumpkin and potatoes cook. 

Oct 10:

Roasted 5th pumpkin with 1/4 PPS and ~1-2 TBSP of brown sugar. 
Roasting Procedure: 300 for 30 mins, then 350 for 30 mins, finally 425 for a bit more. WORK ON THIS. _____ suggested roasting at 300 for an hour. After 300 mins they were still as tough as when I put them in the oven so I cranked the temp up. 30 more mins and they were still tough. Up to 425 I went and just left them in there while I made supper, maybe 20-30 mins. They were pretty soft at this point but still kind of raw.
Warmed lots of water to 120 deg F, (Maybe 8-16 Litres?) to dissolve about 15 lbs honey, med heat works well
Changed to high heat to bring to boil
Pulled apart  pumpkin and added to water, around 90 deg C, 6.5lbs in total more pumpkin next time? I was aiming for 10 lbs. I added 1/2 of a vanilla bean as well, chopped up, might add a second half in secondary fermentation
Boiled for 10-15 mins stirring occasionally. 
Added 4 twists of orange peel, 0.2 lbs, and steeped for 20 mins (Walked to McD's to get ice for some celebratory Scotch) I changed my mind about the orange peel and removed it when I got home.
Left the mixture over night to cool then transferred to plastic bucket and added water to about 23 L

Oct 11:

Pitched a package of Lavilin EC1118 yeast and added it to the mead, also added some yeast energizer and… fuck I forgot (writing this on Nov 5) take better notes next time!

Oct 23 (ish):

 I forgot to mark down the exact date, but this is close. The layer of mush (must?) on top has completely disappeared and the airlock has stopped bubbling. I racked it into a carboy, sucking up most of the sludge (oops) I'll have to strain this out later.

And I'm willing to wait however long it takes to get everything ready to open business.
What I want to know is, what will it require of me to accomplish all of this? You can be as general or specific as you like. Hell, you can even be discouraging as long as you're constructive. So I'm looking for the masters and professionals to tell me how they did it.

I have to say, for anyone who is considering starting mazing, Ken Schramm's ""The Compleat Meadmaker"" is an absolute treasure, not only for its content and level of detail but also because of Ken's obvious passion for mazing (it's contagious). It was a joy to read. 

I also learned tons on r/mead and am still learning everyday. We are both new to homebrewing and I think mazing is a most excellent way to introduce oneself to it.

So in October 2012, after getting the basic equipment we needed at our local homebrewing shop and securing sufficient supplies of honey from a local beekeeper, we finally decided we were ready to maze. We decided to make a ""traditional mead"" to use as a benchmark of sorts, and the second one a JAOM. Both turned out good, but we both prefer the JAOM. I think with more ageing the traditional mead could really turn out though. 

Here's the album: http://imgur.com/a/dAvSb

I added some notes for every picture, but below are some more details on our method. Feel free to ask questions too.

When we prepared the must, we didn't boil anything, sticking to Ken Schramm's prefered method for the most part. This seems to go against common practice but we have had no sanitation issues so far and I like to think that not heating/boiling your honey helps preserve its natural flavour. We racked the traditional mead back in November and decided to experiment and let the JAOM sit on the yeast until bottling day. We're happy with the results and how well they both clarified using gravity only. Before bottling, we did not use any clarifying agents - gravity did all the work for us.


Recipes we used:

**Traditional Mead**

	• 3 lbs white honey (1.4 kg)
	• spring water to fill carboy
	• 1 tsp yeast nutrient
	• 1 tsp yeast energizer
	• 1 packet EC-1118 Lavlin yeast

**Slightly Modified JAOM**

	• 3.5 lbs white honey (1.6 kg)
	• 1 large orange (used zest and juice only)
	• 1 small handful of raisins (25)
	• 1 stick of cinnamon
	• 1 whole clove
	• pinch of nutmeg and allspice
	• 1 packet of EC-1118 bread yeast
	• spring water to fill carboy
	• 1/4 tsp nutrient &amp; 1/2 tsp energizer

For our next project, we intend to use a darker honey, most likely buckwheat, and make a cyser and maybe a pineapple melomel. In the meantime, we're always looking to find additional bulk honey suppliers in the region. We're based around Ottawa, Ontario and it's been quite the challenge so far, but loved every minute of it.

Finally, thank you r/mead for your knowledge and inspiration."	t5_2rcsz	True

I figured I'd share some of my finds. 

For spices, I get them at [Atlantic Spice Company](http://www.atlanticspice.com/). I have found their spices to be amazingly fresh and potent, FAR better quality and lots cheaper than anything I can get from any grocery store including Whole Foods or Trader Joe's.  

For honey, I typically buy from [Dutch Gold](http://www.dutchgoldhoney.com/bulk-honey) in bulk and can buy 62 pound buckets (they say 60 on the website but they're always a bit more) for 100 bucks plus (very reasonable) shipping for their blended honey, up to like 130 for Orange Blossom or Buckwheat honey. 

Last order was like 145 for a pail of buckwheat, so it was only 15 dollars shipping for 62 pounds of honey, and came out to be $2.33 a pound delivered.  


So...other US brewers, where do you guys get your stuff?  And for those in like the UK and Australia or elsewhere, how much do you pay for your ""supplies?""

It is time to brew our second like-minded mead following the basic guidelines of the first one, only this time it will be more open to interpretation.

1. You will brew a cyser. Your choice of recipe, honey variety, style, technique, flavor, ingredients, yeast, size, etc.
2. The only REAL rule is it has to be a cyser of some sorts and it has to be brewed during the month of May (part of these exchanges is it provides exchangeable info and comparable results, since we all takle a like-minded idea).
3. Share your notes, share your photos, share your experience.
4. Sign-up for the actual exchange will take place during February 2013, right after we celebrate the world not ending.
5. The actual exchange will take place on March 2013.

There's still plenty of time to do the actual exchange, so all that logistics and registration and everything will take place much later, for the time being, your job is just to make the best gosh darn cyser you can come up with. Good luck everyone. And may the ~~force~~ drunk be with you!

[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/mead/comments/ojk6t/hey_rmead_help_lets_create_an_original_recipe/)

.............

Unofficial dates (Please reply with any objections to these dates):

-Best made by date is: 02/24/2012 - 03/17/2012 (you have 3 weeks)

-Target for exchanging/shipping bottles is: 12/15/2012

..............

Rules:

1. We will all come to a consensus on the recipe and we will all make the exact same recipe. Everything else is left to skill.
2. We should try and brew roughly during the same timeframe (mentioned above) to keep fermentation times equal.
3. You may sidetrack a bit from the recipe and/or process (quantities, racking, yeast energizer, etc), but you cannot use additional or different flavoring ingredients.
4. The recipe will be called ""Bacon Mead"" (in honor of redditors' obsessive addiction to bacon) or ""r/mead Mead"" (please vote on your favorite) in case you wish to create a custom label for it unless you wish for us to create one for everyone).
5. Matching will start in November, so no need to rush or worry yet, just make sure you make the mead on the mentioned time.
6. If you are against any rules or recipe ingredients, tell us below. If voting goes in your favor, the change will be made.
7. Be sure to post your process so we can compare techniques; and once the bottling and exchange is done we can compare results.

................

""Bacon Mead"" Recipe ([/r/mead](/r/mead) Mead as voted for on the original thread. The recipe is incomplete, so please add additional ingredients and/or vote on your favorites):

Honey: Clover Honey (for accessibility and budget reasons) 3lb per Gallon ratio

Yeast: [D47](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/winemaking-ingredients/yeast/dry/lalvin-wine-yeasts-5-grams-1cv-d-47-white-wine.html). (posted link for those who cannot find it locally, but yeah, any D47)

Yeast Nutrient/Energizer as needed.

Flavor: Juniper (Juniper Berries were chosen as the primary ingredient for the recipe)

................

Still to be voted for:

Since Juniper isn't exactly a ""Main Flavor"" we still need other spices/flavor to add to the mix.

Majority vote for the moment is Pumpkin. No-one has any idea if this works with Juniper, but I think this makes it even more interesting. (yay or nay?)

These spices were suggested on the original thread as things that go along well with juniper (thanks to Kurai_):

orange or lemon peel, cassia bark, anise, cubeb, licorice, saffron, coriander, nutmeg or grains of paradise. People were pretty specific on raisins, and I quote, ""No Fucking Raisins.""

..................

Final rules, recipe, and opt-in info will be posted on the sidebar once everything is official.

Also, this is a self post, so downvoting is unnecessary.

................

TL;DR: Sorry bro/sis, but you have to read the whole thing to know what's going on.

................

EDIT/UPDATE 1: Hello fellow mazers (slang for mead brewers and [/r/mead](/r/mead) word of the day) I was out all day and couldn't do an update. but here we go.

To clarify, the exchange will be basically like a secret santa. Once registration is open (prolly around september/november) we will match participants with one (1) random participant. You will only need to send out one (1) bottle. Preferably a standard 750ml wine bottle, but if budget is tight, we completely understand if you send out a 12oz one (but please try to make the 750ml one happen). Everyone will have a match, so everyone should receive one as well.

The name of the recipe (in case you wish to make your own custom label) will be ""r/mead Mead.""

There already seems to be a recipe winning today, but I will give it maybe 2-3 more days for people to continue voting and contributing to the recipe.

For those that forecast dificulty finding juniper berries, please make it clear in the comments so it may be voted on. Hopefully the internet can help sort out finding some. I myself will have to order them online as well. (usually brew shops and health foods sell them dried).

..............

EDIT/UPDATE 2: I don't see any objections on date, so the dates are now official.

Pumpkin is out. Mr. Pumpkin, please step forward to get your participation ribbon.

.............

EDIT/UPDATE 3: Blackout is about to hit, but I'll just leave this on here.

""[/r/mead](/r/mead) MEAD"" was the voted on name, but if you have any other suggestions, please go ahead. We don't even have to have an ""official"" name for the recipe. You can be original if you want. post and vote.

There seem to be a lot of great suggestions. Tomorrow I will run through everything again and I will post the winning recipe. Lemon or orange peels or zest seem to be taking the lead by a lot.

...........

EDIT/UPDATE 4: Preliminary Final Recipe (from what I've gathered from comments and votes):

-Clover Honey - 3lb per gallon

-D47

-Juniper Berries (dried for accessibility; fresh ok too I guess)

-Orange peel

-Dates

Yay or nay? Seems a bit basic, but then again, this way anyone can do it and it won't cost too much. Anything else you wish to add? Licorice? Cinnamon? Lemon instead of orange? Zest instead of peel? One Two VOTE!

............

LAST UPDATE/EDIT BEFORE POSTING RULES AND RECIPES:

I was thinking. How about we just keep the rules like this. The only things that are ""obligated"" is the clover honey 3lb per gallon, the yeast D47, and the juniper berries. Any other spices/flavors/techniques/process is completely up to you. Does that sound like something we can all agree with? If not, I will pick the most upvoted ingredients and it will be posted in the rules/recipe. ;) VOTE!

............

GOSH! Another UPDATE:

Voting is closed. All has been decided. Prepare for some awesome mead making my friends. Official rules and other stuff you probably won't read to be announced and posted on the sidebar later today!

1375895132.0	1jw776	"""Natural"" Yeast Nutrients"	ignoramus012	16	3	17	"After brewing extract beer kits intermittently for two years, I've been delving deeper into the home brewing hobby.

I made two ciders that have been aging and/or bottle conditioning for about six months. One in particular came out really hot. I learned that this is due to, in part, increased production of fusel alcohols by the yeast because of unhealthy fermentation. Having been used to only beers, I was unaware of the need for yeast nutrients.

So, when I decided to make my first mead this week, I made sure to purchase some yeast nutrient/ energizer from my LHBS. I put 5 tsp of this mix into the must at pitch (I ignored recommendations of a staggered addition schedule mostly due to laziness, but after looking into it further, I wish I had). While I realize the yeast need these compounds, it just didn't feel right dumping these weird smelling powders into my sweet must. I don't really think that organic/ ""natural"" foods/ additives are inherently better than those that are conventionally grown/ made; my aversion to the compounds in this form is purely visceral. Water, honey and yeast seem to be such pure ingredients, it felt like I was tainting the must.

That being said, I looked up some more ""natural"" solutions. By that I mean ways to get the nutrients into the must from less ""processed"" sources. I've read that raisins, black tea, lemon juice, dead yeast, and even grape nuts cereal contain the necessary compounds (another separate but related question: if I were to use dead yeast, could I take a leftover yeast cake from another brew, freeze it , then thaw it out when needed, or would these fluctuations in temperature destroy the compounds? Do I add the whole cake? A few teaspoons?). I'm unsure what is best. Has anybody used any of these in lieu of something like Fermaid K? 

Ideally, I'd like to find something or a mix of things that adds a minimum of flavors to the end product but still allows for healthy fermentation and, in a way that I might be able to add at staggered intervals. I understand things like that will impart *some* flavor, but I'd like the honey to largely speak for itself.

Here are some pictures, and some information (not me in the pictures, but my homebrewing awesome friend).

The OG was about 1.106, and FG was 1.000. So it's a bit on the dry side, but not terribly so. 

It started off as 15 lbs of raw honey from a local source (got a friend who keeps bees), some orange juice, 3 packs of Lalvin EC-1118, 4.5 campden tablets, 2.5 tsp pectic enzyme, some yeast nutrient and tannins as well as some acid blend. 

I racked onto about 5 lbs of peaches after a month or so, but wish I'd done so sooner rather than later. 

It was rocket fuel two months ago, and now that it's sat for another two, it's mellowed out quite a bit. It's going to be much nicer in another month or two after being in the bottle, so I look forward to tasting it in June.

Racking is not going to help your mead clear. Mead's clear because the particulate matter settles out due to the force of gravity. Heavier (larger) particles in general settling faster than lighter (smaller) particles. Racking can make your mead less clear because 1) you keep stirring up the particles in the mead each time and 2) no matter how gently you rack, each time you suck the particles up that racking wand, you have the potential for breaking up the particles even more,  and ending up with smaller and lighter particles that now take even longer to settle out. 

The only way to speed up the settling process is to use some type of fining agent that modifies the surface chemistry of the particles, allowing them to agglomerate so they settle faster. I know very little about fining agents because I never use them. Well, I used one once but I don't remember off hand which one it was and my log book is not at hand at the moment. If anyone wants to chime in on the use of fining agents at this point, please do so!

I rack two times when I make mead. Once from primary to secondary, and once from secondary to bottling bucket. When I'm cooking at home, I do primary in a 8 gallon plastic bucket for 2-4 weeks, and secondary in a glass carboy for 2-6 months. 

Now, please don't take this post as if I am talking down to anyone. All I've learned is from my mistakes or from advice from wiser mead and beer makers. The first mead advice I received was ""put the honey in the carboy with water and yeast and stick it in the back of your closet  and forget about it (except to refill your airlock) for one year and it will be great!""

I've been building up to an attempt to make some of my own mead after trying some last year and loving it. I don't know if the mead I got was a special type, stronger than normal, or what (it was Moniack mead). It was delicious, but definitely suited for sipping. However, I can't help but notice that whenever reading, watching, or playing anything with mead involved (yes, I know it's fiction, but...) everyone involved is just sucking back the mead in huge tankards.

This got me wondering, what sort of mead is being drunk here that they're able to drink it like that? The mead I had, I would probably choke if I tried. Are they just that much harder than I, that they chug my ""sipping"" mead? Or is it a lighter, more beerlike mead? If so, what would go into making it?

Second, There are a LOT of things in the works behind the scenes, including a few bottle exchanges, an [/r/mead](/r/mead) competition (probably will take place next year, so get those meads ready), and a cross-subreddit bottle exchange with our brothers and sisters in r/homebrewing, r/winemaking, and [/r/brewing](/r/brewing) (sadly, distilling is illegal, so we cannot trade with [/r/firewater](/r/firewater) :( :(.

Unfortunatly, as one might say 'I dun goofed' and ended up filling my demijohn right up to the neck. I'm only a few hours on and I've realised what I've done! It has nowhere near enough headspace and it's just foaming out through the airlock, I've had to change it 3 times in the last hour!

My plan is to transfer it to a plastic brewing bucket in the morning which is about 5 gallons compared to the 1 gallon demijohn. Seeing as it's less than 24 hours old, I don't see any trouble with literally tipping it from one to the other, would you say this is okay, or should I siphon it? I'm hoping that after the primary (which I'm told can be as little as a week with braggot) I'll siphon it back into a demijohn for it's secondary fermentation and hopefully then it won't foam quite so much!

I'm researching the terroir-like qualities of mead for my undergraduate thesis. I started 6 batches of classic mead (i.e. bare minimum ingredients) earlier this year using wildflower honey from different regions in Ontario. My goals have changed a bit, and I'd like to expand my scope geographically. I no longer have time to make my own, so I'm taking advantage of this awesome community to ask if anyone has it in their hearts to share their beautiful mead with me. It's a complete long shot, but I can't not ask! 

Since I'm trying to determine differences based on landscape (i.e. flower composition), I'm looking for mead made as similarly to my own as possible. Therefore wildflower honey is a must. I'm slightly less concerned with the yeast variety. (I used Lalvin EC-1118). Age and methods are important as well, but I don't want to scare everyone off just yet. 

I can elaborate further, but I'll leave it at that for now. I'm also open to any suggestions.

I.E. - techniques on mead making, types of honey, what to avoid... That kind of stuff.

Recipe:

9 LBS Amber Honey from Northern Brewer

2 LBS Wildflower Honey from a farmers market

1.5 LBS Clover Honey from the store

2 Packets of Red Star Cote Des Blanc rehydrated

OG: 1.092

Added a tablespoon of yeast nutrient with the must, and then added another table at 24 hours and at 48 hours.  

2 weeks later I'm still getting one bubble per 6 seconds.  SG was 1.011 when I tested it yesterday, and it still tastes a bit sweet for me.  I think I'll stop fermentation at around 1.007.  Should be tomorrow.  Then I'll add the clarifying agent.

The taste is nothing like I expected.  I was thinking it would be basically like jet fuel, but it already tastes like a clean sweet white wine, and then the aftertaste just coats your tongue with a honey feel.  Jesus it's good.  Also, I've never had mead so I didn't know what to expect.  I guess with everyone saying you had to age it so long I wasn't ready for it to be so good!

1328764566.0	pheys	I didn't know you all existed otherwise I'd have posted here, but I was told you'd be able to appreciate this here. Can't wait to learn more. (x posted from Homebrewing)	NameAboutStuff	15	2	13	"This past weekend I was invited to a Super Bowl party by some mutual friends and ended up falling into conversation with a man only a handful of souls have had the fortune of meeting. We'll call him Randy. I was warned a loud, pervish, impossible-to-miss drunkard may come sweeping through the place, eating all of the appetizers and spewing curses. The hosts wife, 5 hours worth of drinking deep, approached me and said ""That's Randy... he never comes out but just once every few months and hes a fireball whoooo wwweeee he brews his own mead and I hear his basement is like a chemistry lab but no one has ever tasted it and like--""

*wait*... **What?**

I've always wanted to brew mead as it's one of my favorite things to drink and I've had friends attempt to brew. She runs and relays the message to him. He approaches me and says ""What you know about mead?"". I say, ""Uh, I've only had a few kinds but I know it's the Drink of Kings but I've always been interested in 'Snow Mead', where you freeze gallons of mead and then scoop the liquid off the top that doesn't freeze, which I'm told is pure alcohol."" He says, ""Oh yeah! We call it 'Ice Wine'. Takes alot to make a little. You wanna try some of mine?"" The hosts and neighbors damn near kicked me out the door they were so excited he had given an invitation. Apparently they had lived there 11 years and he had never let anyone in his home or let them see or taste his product. He brews and bottles everything, labels and all, purely for his own enjoyment.

[I had to sneak these in. I hope he never sees these because he knows who I am now](http://imgur.com/a/KTpTm)

All I can say is, I'm ready to brew my own mead now. I can't count the different types he had going. Avocado, Hibiscus, Classic, Blueberry, Raspberry, Apple, Mesquite, Hickory, Orange, Peach, etc... and most were aged in a whiskey oak barrel. Everything so clean and pristine. His basement was his personal Gentleman's Meadery. We were his taste testers. He demanded we smell and guess before tasting as well as afterwards. He would toast with comments like ""..and the flavor of this brew comes from dipping my balls in it...*cheers*"" or for the strawberry ""...and the color of this brew is from the tip of my penis's blood...*cheers*"" Weird ass cajun old man, but funny as hell. Crude as can be, but a true gentleman and a really nice guy.

After 2 bottles of his 17% oak mead, I forgot all of the directions. Good thing he gave me his email afterwards. If you'd like, PM me and I'll keep you posted on what he says when he responds and how to do everything.

1353286107.0	13fabd	Questions about secondary and bottling	RealFatChicken	12	1	3	"Hello, I just started an experimental mead that I'm hoping will end up being a refreshing, sparkling hydromel-style mead (with a strong mint flavor plus a hint of lemon). I started by boiling a gallon of water for 10 minutes with 1/2 cup mint leaves from my garden, 1tbs ginger root, and 1 ts cloves... very interesting (and good) smell. I then brought it down to 150, and added 6lbs clover honey and stirred it in for 10 minutes (not sure if the temperature was necessary, I thought I'd be safe and pasteurize). 

I then put the mixture in a 3-gallon glass carboy and filled with spring water up to 3 gallons, once the temperature was about room temperature (~70f) I pitched 1 packet of safbrew s-33 ale yeast (a part of the experiment). Unfortunately I didn't take a hydrometer reading at this time. 

So my questions are:

1.) At what point should I rack and move to a secondary? Right now my fermentation has slowed down from about 1/bubble/0.5second to 1/bubble/3seconds, so it's still fermenting pretty strongly but has slowed. When I move to secondary I want to add a couple sliced lemons (maybe 6 lemons, sound good?) and more mint leaves if the mint taste is hidden.

2.) With beer yeast, I'm not positive how tolerant it will be ABV-wise. If I rack to secondary until the fermentation is complete, can I prime the mead and bottle and expect the yeast to get active again to carbonate the bottles? Is it fine to prime with honey, or should I get corn sugar? 

Thanks!"	t5_2rcsz	True

I came by some free maple syrup, so of course I'm going to make a mead out of it!

I used 1.2kg of maple syrup and got an OG of 1.100.  After a month of fermentation it was quite dry at 0.994, and didn't have super maple flavor.  I added 75g (2 fl oz) of grade B dark syrup each week, tasting along the way.

I'm now a week after the 4th such addition and it hasn't fermented any more.  Gravity is now 1.002, and I'm happy to report that it now tastes significantly better.  Had a pronounced maple flavor with pleasantly fruity notes.  Still needs some aging as it tastes quite boozy.

By my estimates this is up around ~16% ABV, which matches the tolerance listed for the yeast I used.  Racked it off the lees and put it in the cellar for some bulk aging before bottling.  We'll see how it tastes this fall!"	t5_2rcsz	True

Looks like a whole bunch of folks, including myself are in the early to mid stages of brewing up some really, really awesome stuff like JOAM, classic mead, cyzer and other creative homebrews...  

...and given the proper time for secondary and tertiary racking plus a little bottle aging, it all points to a summer and autumn that everyone here is gonna be writing posts about how strong/awesome/odd/tasty/horrible or otherwise their concoctions are...

I'm curious, what's everyone on Meaddit working on right now? How long have you been at this? What do you have planned for the next month?  I'll start:

I'm a noob.  Started 6 weeks ago.

What I'm working on right now:
- 5 gallon clover mead (racking to 2nd this sunday)
- (2) 1 gallon batches of a cider with 1 lb honey per gallon
- 1/2 gallon of a pomegranate wine. (started it last night and got an OG of 1.135)
- Bottled an English Brown Ale and should be ready to drink on saturday

What I'm planning:
-5 gallons of JOAM and will probably use clementines
-1 gallon Cyzer (I'll probably use 3lbs of honey and D47)
-1 gallon Perry (maybe)

And since all of us will be doing the same mead, it will be a group experience with comparable results. What do you say?

*

TL;DR: My grandmother makes the best lemon cookies.

*

this is a self post, so don't downvote until we hear from everybody.

*

EDIT: We can start with the basics.

What honey should we use?

Spiced/flavored/citric/original mead?

*

EDIT 2: Quick summary, Clover honey or wildflower honey. 3lb per gallon ratio. a sweet mead yeast like wyeast 4184. Anything you rather not use mentioned, please comment below.

What about additional ingredients? fruits? nuts? spices? non? keep at it.

EDIT 2.1: Also, can we get mods involved so we can set a brew and bottle exchange time-frame? (i think if we all brew in the same time frame, it will be up to skill to make the better mead, since it will age the same for everyone.)

*

EDIT 3: can everyone get Orange Blossom Honey? If not, we are going clover. Maybe one of those blended ones from costco for budget friendly reasons (as suggested by mortaine)?

*

EDIT 4: Ok so, Clover or orange blossom honey?

Nut flavored mead. Which nuts?

Sweet mead yeast. Possibly wyeast 4184? EDIT 4.1: What about D47?

3lb per gallon ratio.

To be brewed in the next two months more or less. Fall or Christmas bottle exchange?

*

*

EDIT 5: Ok, so from all the posts, I've gathered this much. We are almost finished.

Honey: Clover Honey. 3lb per gallon ratio.

Yeast: D47

Flavor/Type: A nutty mead. Also, a few people mentioned juniper. This MAY sound crazy, but it is original (to my knowledge). Does anyone know of any nut that might go well with Juniper Berries?

Only 2 people mentioned spiced, so I'm guessing this one is out. Although a someone mentioned a pumpkin spiced, which sounds legit. Thoughts?

Bottle exchange will be more or less during end of year, so we should set a brew time frame for the very near future. Feedback?

*

EDIT 6: Votes are in. We are only waiting on what nut might go well with Juniper Berries and we are set! Common guys. DO EET!

EDIT 6.1: just talked to mods and they are in. When the recipe is competed and we have a date set, he will post on sidebar.

*

EDIT (infinity): A very smart and considerate mazer (Kurai_) made a great point on nuts and allergies, so nuts will be benched. Juniper berries still seem to be the preferred way to go, so all we need now is to choose the final ingredients (spices or whatnots) to finish the recipe and also the measurements. This thread probably already ran it's course, so I will make a more official one next with all the updated info.

Well, just earlier this month, the yeast woke up and decided it wants to get busy again. It's actually being so active that, with the raisins floating to the top, foam is forming and staying, and I may have to put the blowoff tube back in.

Currently I am making my first mead, and I have a question. It's an orange/clove mead that's been sitting in a glass carboy for about six months. 

I made the mistake of adding the orange pith during the early stages, and now my mead has a distinct bitter taste. Along with the bitterness, I hardly taste any sweetness, though I have roughly 15 lbs of honey in a 5 1/2 gallon batch of mead.

My question is: Can and should I add more honey to my carboy and let it sit for a few more months? Will this add a sweeter flavor to my mead?

Just got into doing mead this summer, which has led to me now getting into my own bee keeping (another thing that Reddit helped with)!

Anyway, I did the ""Storm the Castle"" recipe, but I used 50% apple juice and some fresh cut apples in the brew, in place of the water. When I first bottled it, it was super sweet.  I had 3 full 500 ml bottles, and one partial. I put them in the top of a dark closet and didn't mess with them. Now it is November, and I tried about 30 ml of the partial bottle and WOW.  The sweetness has toned down, you can clearly taste the apples and a hint of the raisins.  It turned out to be a really good brew, especially for my first one.

Well, I got three guys that I work with everyday very closely.  For various reasons at work, my informal nickname became ""the possum"", so I came up with this label:

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/y3ORF)

They knew I was doing my first brew, and showed interest as well as asking the standard questions.  All of them said that they wanted to try it, no matter how it came out!

So here is my idea Reddit, a 500 ml bottle of my very first brew with this label, and my homemade beef jerky(various types: hot and spicy, Carolina BBQ, Deer, etc. vacuum packed, yep I do that too!) On their desk the last working day before Christmas break. 

I think it would be an awesome gift for any guy, but better because they know me , know I made everything, and it was my first brew.

Not looking for Karma...I got more than enough, just you thoughts and feedback on the label and plan is appreciated.

1348609553.0	10h0yb	Ginger Mead?	LongUsername	12	0	8	"Does anyone have a simple recipe for a strong Ginger mead? I'm looking for something that would be similar to a ""Dark and Stormy"" in a bottle. I love the great ginger bite/burn.

I have experience making Apfelwein &amp; beer, but not any with Mead yet.

Here's what I was thinking so far:

* Use some unsulfured molasses to give it some of the ""rummy"" qualities.
* Spice it with some Cinnamon, anise, clove &amp; vanilla to get some more of the ""spiced rum"" flavor.
* Add some lime juice before bottling for flavor.
* Add a bunch of Ginger to primary (or should this be done as a secondary similar to a ""dry hop""?)
* D-47 for yeast (It's our fav for Apfelwein, so figured I'd try it in a mead)

I've also heard that ginger loses flavor over time?  Anyone have any experience with this?  How soon would I have to drink my ""Spiced Ginger Mead""?

1344548871.0	xyn95	One great success story to share (belgian mead), one failure that warrants some advice	Jo-Sef	16	3	6	"The great success:

Quinte Essence (Belgian mead) - 1 gallon batch

* Roughly 2.8 pounds wildflower honey
* Roughly 6 oz. crushed light candi sugar
* Zest of one orange
* 1/2 tsp cracked coriander seed
* 1/2 vial WLP-500 yeast
* Water
* Yeast nutrient/energizer (SNAs)

After as much research as I could do on belgian ale yeast in mead (there isn't much out there) I tried this out and hoped for the best.  O.G. was about 1.111 and F.G. just topped out at 1.020 putting it around 11% abv.  This thing was drinkable AND smelled great all throughout fermentation.  Even at 1.040 it was delicious.  Don't expect all the crazy phenols you would get with a belgian ale, but do expect an amazing citrusy flavor with a great balance of coriander.  It's perfectly smooth with hints of vanilla throughout (no idea where that came from but it's incredible).  The alcohol is undetectable.  It's as if this thing has been aging for months and it's only 2 weeks old - I'm going to have to get it in bottles asap or it will disappear.  Please try this out you won't be disappointed - and google ""the book of quinte essence"" for the inspiration for this brew.  It's a very entertaining read.

Now for my problem child...or should I say children.

A little while back I brewed an amazing red pyment with red grape concentrate and wildflower honey, aged on french oak and cloves called Old Winyards 1296.  It has since been bottled, and it is very difficult not to drink it.  When I made the must I realized too late that I had too much fermentable sugar, and was dumping a lot of it out so as to water it down.  In hindsight I figured I could do a scaled down batch at a later date, stretching the fermentables I used for a 1 gallon batch into a 2 gallon batch, creating something of a lighter bodied/less alcoholic version I am calling Young Winyards.  I did this on 07/29/12, and fermentation hauled ass (11.7% in 4 days!).  The Old Winyards was extremely quick too - 16.2% in 8 days, and it was drinkable right off the bat and has only gotten better.  The Young Winyards however, reeks like rotten eggs.  It's really bad.  It's all you can smell when you sample it.  I tried racking and splashing to no avail.  Does anyone have any ideas for masking the H2S odor?  Is it possible it can age out?  I know most off-flavors do but I've heard H2S doesn't usually, plus the whole point of this mead was to hold me over so I don't drink all my Old Winyards.  I was thinking of possibly adding more oak and clove, and/or possibly some other spices.  Would back-sweetening with honey/water help?  (right now it's 100% dry).  At this point I don't care if I turn it into a completely different drink - I just want something that doesn't smell like pure rotten egg.  Help!"	t5_2rcsz	True

All she asks for is a bottle or two every so often.  

The problem is I'm not sure what the bee keeper is after.  I went over to check it out (as close as I dared to get) but all i see is palmetto, Brazilian pepper plant and sea grape trees.  There are a few interesting flowers around as well as some prickly pear cactus, but that's about it.

So the question, is this going to make good mead?  I have used wild flower honey thus far but would palmetto/sea grape/some random unknown plants make a good mead?  The honey tastes great.

The first 3 where standard mead of varying sweetness and every time when racking out of the primary they have tasted and smelled awful.

Well I decided to make a blueberry melomel following this recipe (using ec-1118):

[Recipe](http://pastebin.com/bxNm5i24)

I was on step five and about to rack into secondary with more honey and blueberries. I pulled off the airlock and it smelled great. Like a real wine. I was surprised but expected it to taste like death anyways. After racking I tasted the bit still in the racking cane and it was amazing. I am not really sure why.

The first three gallons of mead I used the [stormthecastle.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2ueyNQfnfE) recipe that used a few oranges and raisins for nutrients. I added just a few raisins to the melomel and the boiled lees from a gallon of mead I had just racked (I didn't do this to the first three.) I also ended up adding a little bit more blueberries on accident to the primary so I used les in the secondary and a little under a pound of honey in the secondary. Other than that I followed the recipe.

Anyone have any ideas?

SO I finally started a mead this weekend, 12lbs of orange blossom in  ~5gallons, I used Red Star Côte des Blancs for the yeast, I made a 500ml starter with some honey and table sugar, didn't let it ferment long but it seemed vigorous. No heat involved (I never do with mead)

Anyhoo, i don't plan on messing with it until i rack it, which will be about a month from now.

Ever since learning of the existence of hot pepper varieties I've been thinking of trying something habanero-based.  I still have a small baggie full of small orange habs I grew last year (i think i have at least 8 which haven't been sacrificed to the Chili gods so far), so my supply is good.  I'm just not sure how many to try in my first gallon.  I'm planning to go conservative (for me) on this batch but even then I've heard numbers ranging from 1 up to 3 or 4 for a gallon.  I'd appreciate any feedback or experience.

Here's the recipe I'm thinking of, so far:

* 2 lbs orange blossom honey (may up to 2 1/2 or 3)
* 1 peel of a large-ish navel orange into Primary (i'm thinking peel only, i'm not aiming for it to be an orange melomel, i just want flavor from the zest)
* 1 or 2 habs into Primary, halved or diced (but otherwise, including everything but the stem)
* EC-1118 (the second half of the packet i used for my first batch above)

One of the things I'm less sure of is whether to add the habs &amp; orange peel into the primary, or to wait to secondary - i'm also not averse to staggering (1 hab into primary and additional ones added to taste later-on).  And if anyone was curious, the spiciness level i'm going for is like... ""sip me slowly"" hot, but not necessarily ""1 sip melts your face off"" hot.  I have moderately high spice tolerance, though I hesitate to say I'm a pepper-head ;-)

* They state that they only ferment for about two months. How are they able to get away with such a short fermentation time? I'm guessing that it's related to the fact that they use Potassium Sorbate to end fermentation.

* They say they filter the Mead they produce to a very clear mead. What sort of filtering would they likely do?"	t5_2rcsz	True

1346909051.0	zfpyj	One Year In: My first mead	mortaine	11	2	5	"My first 1-gallon batch was made with stuff from the grocery store (honey, water, fleishmann's, oranges, raisins-- real simple), and I didn't have very high expectations of it.  I also made a LOT of mistakes, spilled a LOT of it (including in my CAR!), had siphon problems-- everything imaginable. I was surprised when it didn't sprout a contamination, considering all the problems and mishaps I had.

But, low expectations: If it had alcohol in it when I was done, I'd be satisfied. It cost me $21 to make.

I already drank one bottle of it back in April. It was very yeasty-- tasted a lot like bread.

Well. It turned 1 two days ago. So today I poured myself a glass.

First, it's completely clear. There's quite a bit of sediment in the bottle, but I'm okay with that. The liquid itself is a lovely golden color.

Second, it tastes quite dry-- dryer than I ever expected. It's good, though, with just a tiny ""bread yeast"" after flavor. I'm not sure how alcoholic it is, but it tastes good, and it's helping me hang onto my buzz.

Would I make more with this recipe? No-- I would use a better yeast. Good yeast is cheap, and I have 8 packets in my fridge.

However, I have a housewarming party next month, and I think I will put some of my mead out as a ""here, try this"" drink for my guests.

So, I'm raising my glass to you, /r/mead/, for helping to see me through my first year. To many more batches ahead!

1331798166.0	qxj72	Applications of expensive vs. cheap honey	jumbopanda	12	0	9	"Almost a month ago, I made my first mead; a cherry cyser using raw, unheated raspberry honey. I received comments saying that I was using unnecessarily expensive honey in a mead with so much fruit flavor, and that such honey were best utilized in traditional meads. Well, now I am thinking about making two more batches, one traditional, and one pineapple coconut melomel. I currently have a 12lb jug of raw, unheated orange blossom honey that cost me $64 shipped to my door. I got it from Honey Pacifica, the same place I got the raspberry from. Needless to say, this is expensive stuff, and this time around I'm really thinking about ordering a cheaper honey for the pineapple coconut melomel. I came across Miller's Honey, which offers orange blossom honey for about $30 per gallon (12lb), and the shipping cost for two gallons is $14. This is incredibly cheap compared to the honey I currently have, but I believe it is heated to 120F and filtered. Still, I would think that it wouldn't make much of a difference after being mixed with pineapple and coconut, and I've heard mazers say good things about this brand.

So here are my options:

1. Split my 12lbs of expensive honey into two 2 gallon batches, one traditional and one pineapple coconut

2. Spend $74 and get 24lb of the Miller's honey, use 15lb for a 5 gallon batch of pineapple coconut, and have 9lb left over for other stuff I might want to do in the future. Use the expensive honey I currently have for a 4-5 gallon batch of traditional.

I'm really not sure I want to have THREE big batches going on right now, since I just started. But I would be getting a lot for that extra $74 spent."	t5_2rcsz	True

I had a couple extra gallons of honey sitting around, and I thought, man, I need to do a traditional mead and oak it. I also wanted to experiment with bread yeast (a friend of mine swears by it, if you add enough nutrient to counter stress and funk, so I added a LOT of nutrients). Sort of a modern/ancient, experimental batch.

The primary was blazing, incidentally; I've only seen activity like this with turbo yeast. Now it's calming down (haven't taken a reading yet--I wait a month for primary to finish, just to be sure), and I'm considering oak chips. 

Now, I know from Schramm about the kinds of chips out there, and I want to keep it simple and go with a medium toast of standard American oak. But how long do I leave the chips in secondary? I mean, for liquor, barrel aging for years is awesome, and I know that the increased surface area of the chips will speed things up, but how much?

1.5 L ""Simply Apple"" cider, or other apple juice without preservatives

1/2 lb. ""Ambrosia"" raw Colorado honey or other quality honey.

1 teaspoon yeast nutrient

1 dry packet of Lalvin EC-1118 yeast (or other dry wine yeast)

Make a starter the day before with about 6 ounces of apple juice, 1 teaspoon yeast nutrient, and the packet of yeast.  Keep in a sanitized swingtop (Grolsch-style) beer bottle with a sanitized airlock.

Sanitize your fermenter, airlock, funnel, etc.  Boil 1 liter of filtered water and cool to about 100F.  Add the honey and warm water to the fermenter and shake to dissolve.  Add the apple juice and continue mixing to add oxygen.  

Pitch half of the yeast starter and cap the fermenter with an airlock.  Seal up the bottle of yeast starter and keep in the fridge.  After about 1 week of fermentation (or whenever fermentation slows down), add the other half of the yeast starter, being sure to warm it up and vent the CO2 beforehand.

We mixed three pounds of honey into a gallon of spring water, pitched some Lavin 1118 yeast, popped a fermentation lock on it, and let it sit for a handful of months. When it was well and truly done bubbling and had been sitting long enough, we siphoned it into three brown beer growlers, added a bit of honey (that champagne yeast produced a taste reminiscent of rocket fuel, and we needed to sweeten it) and thought we were done.

Today one of those growlers bottle-grenaded all over my in-laws' kitchen floor.

Thankfully nobody was hurt, but we're going to be spending the next couple of days scouring the house for pieces of glass. 

I'm really at a loss here. Did adding the honey to sweeten it re-start the yeast? FIL is a former beer homebrewer and says nothing kills yeast. Where did we go wrong and how do we prevent this from happening again?

Figured it'd be fine, I'd be careful. Obviously, in the course of bottling I sucked some up, and as a result, it's got a yeasty flavor I can't do much about. 

Live and learn, I figured. I have a *lot* of mead going in my basement, and that was by no means undrinkable. The next time around, I made a point to rack quite a few times before I added finings, then rack off the fining agents (Kieselsol/Chitosan). Only after that did I bottle, out of a fresh carboy.

The last portion was still yeasty. Very different than the samples I pulled from the top, and different, even than the sample I pulled halfway through bottling. Perhaps I'm not tasting yeast, but a higher concentration of the crushed campden tablets or potassium metabisulfite I threw in, that didn't get sucked up until I tilted the carboy to get the last part.

Edit: I have not had this problem with 1-gallon batches. Just 5-gallon.

1375655212.0	1jpcgq	Meadery Tour Report: Starrlight Mead in Pittsboro, NC	ThereAreFourLights_	10	1	3	"I celebrated yesterday's Mead Day at [Starrlight Mead](http://http://starrlightmead.com/) in North Carolina. This is a small commercial meadery that will be celebrating its third birthday on Labor Day weekend.

I would describe the atmosphere for Mead Day as that of a mini-Renn Faire. Groups were doing sword fighting demonstrations and singing folk songs, and a handful of small businesses were offering jewelry, art, chainmail, and turkey legs for sale outside.

The highlight for me was the tasting and the tour of the meadery. The owners and their friends/employees were on hand and well informed. Here are my thoughts:

**Tasting**: Starrlight offers a [wide variety of meads](http://starrlightmead.com/our-meads). I was able to taste eight or so meads they produced on site. Overall, I liked most of the products and found only two not to my taste. The absolute best was their Spiced Apple Mead.

Sticking your nose in a glass of the Spiced Apple Mead was the same as coming home to Mom's apple pie. The aroma offered strong notes of cinnamon and apple. The taste was much the same and offered a lot of sweet apple enjoyment. This mead would be at its best served warm on a cold winter day or room temp with a savory meat. Not surprisingly, the Spiced Apple won the Starrs (the owners) Best in Show at the 2006 International Mead Association's Mead Festival.

The two mainstream meads were the Traditional Off-Dry and the Traditional Semi-Sweet. Both were quite palatable and would best be served chilled. Interestingly enough, the Traditional Off-Dry serves as the basis for all of Starrlight's meads, with the exception of smaller seasonal batches.

I didn't care for the Off-Dry Pear Mead, and the Meadjito was so overwhelmed by mint that it tasted like mouthwash. These two were the exception though, and I was happy to take home a very sweet Peach Mead for the wife and a Lavendar Mead for myself.

**The Tour**: Starrlight has two 1,100 L primary fermentation tanks, a smaller (800 L? 900 L?) primary fermentation tank for seasonal batches, and four 1,100 secondary fermentation tanks. Fermentation, racking, bottling, and labeling all take place in the [production room](http://starrlightmead.com/content/production-area-progress), which was about the size of a two-car garage. Another room served as storage, and most square footage in their space was devoted to the [tasting room](http://starrlightmead.com/content/tasting-room-progress).

The production room was truly interesting. Anyone with a single carboy at home would recognize the purpose of everything in the production room as similar to their home equipment, just on a bigger scale.

For filling bottles, Starrlight had a gravity-fed system that could handle six bottles at a time. Corking was done with a floor model, hand-operated wine corker that you could find at any decent homebrewing shop ([example](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007PTG1C)). They use synthetic corks and blue or green bottles. Instead of foil caps, they use PVC capsules that are heat-shrunk to fit the bottle in two seconds ([examples](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/winemaking-equipment/wine-bottling/pvc-capsules-decorative-finishes.html)).

The one place where Starrlight invested money in automation was the labeling. They purchase labels on rolls of 1,000 and mount the roll on a machine. The machine allows a bottle to be placed horizontally between two rollers. With the push of a button, the bottle is rotated and one label is applied. The result is uniform and even. Not bad compared to my home system of masking tape and Sharpie! The mazer said bottling, corking, and labeling 100 cases takes 2 hours with 2-3 people working.

Interestingly enough, most meads at Starrlight start out as the Traditional Off-Dry Mead. Fermentation starts with just honey, yeast (Lalvin 71B-1122), and filtered water. At the first break, the mazer adds Fermaid-K, and at the second break, he adds DAP to help the yeast finish. The starting must has a sugar content of 23.5%, which yields an end result of 12.5% abv. This number is important because the mazer must pay additional excise taxes on wines above 14% abv.

With fermentation done and a product at 12.5% abv, the must is cold-crashed via the chiller jacket on the primary tank, then pumped into a secondary fermentation tank. If the mead is going to be sweetened, the mazer adds more honey to backsweeten. Starrlight adds fruit juices to the Off-Dry Tradititional in secondary to create most of its other flavors. I believe they use actual fruit for smaller fun batches or seasonal batches.

The one real surprise was on sanitation. Starrlight uses citric acid and water to clean its tanks. I had never heard of this method, but they prefer it over harsher chemicals. According to the mazer, they have not encountered any spoiled meads or flora/fauna problems in the tanks.

Overall I was very impressed by the production operation. They clearly know mead. I'm looking forward to trying the Lavendar and hope to make another trip there in the future.

I hope you all liked this write-up. It really struck me that anyone with the right capital, know-how, and interest in mead could start a meadery. Please let your fellow Meadittors know about your own meadery tours! Happy Meading!"	t5_2rcsz	True

5 tsp. DAP

2.5 tsp energizer (DAP, springcell, Magnesium sulfate)

I activated the yeast and put it all in the carboy. I checked it 18 hours later and the bottom is dark dark golden with honey, the top part is extremely cloudy yellow with a nice foam layer on top and a little bit of the must made it into by airlock (guess I underestimated the required headroom).

This is the best honey I've used, and it's particularly rare and expensive this year, so I want to pull out all the stops to make the best possible varietal without masking the tupelo flavor, possibly with an eye to competition.

Water to 1 gallon

Handful of raisins for nutrient

Aerate first three days.

Ferment dry (~12% alcohol), backsweeten to 1.005-1.010, to taste.

Acid blend to taste before bottling, erring on the cautious side.

He listed off a bunch of horses, and I picked a random one based on its name, not based on odds, because I didn't know what they were, and frankly he was too inebriated to tell me.  

Well the gambling gods were smiling down on me that night...and I won $800 bucks.  

I have decided to take this windfall, and pump it into my favorite past time...brewing!   

So after doing some measuring, I figured that I can get these [Conical 6.5 gallon Fermenters](http://www.homebrewing.org/Minibrew-65-Gallon-Conical-Fermenter_p_1018.html) and they won't take up any more functional space than my current 6.5 gallon carboys...but I could essentially leave them in place, primary to bottling.   I don't have the height for the 8 gallon or larger units (I live in a condo and my brew space is limited to under a counter.)  

Has anyone used one of them?  They seem to get pretty decent reviews, plus I can afford to buy 3 of them, along with my long desired Buon Vino Mini Jet Filter for the magical $800 bucks.  I will just pay for shipping as $150 (out of my pocket not counting my windfall) seems reasonable for all of that stuff no?

Just looking for some advice here...is there any other good conicals for around the same price ($190 each) that will fit UNDER a 33&amp;3/4"" counter?

I am sick of fighting with carboys, racking between containers, trying not to disturb sediment, etc.  and I figured that conicals would be the next logical step, especially combined with my new juicer, which will turn any fruit I'm going to toss into the mix into a nice gooey paste which will flow right through the valves instead of chunks.  


Oh and I just bottled my [Kumquat/Clementine sack mead](http://i.imgur.com/YgYK0nK.jpg) (finished at 19%!!!) and it's freaking awesome!! Used 4 pounds per gallon of buckwheat honey, 2 pounds per gallon Kumquats in primary and Clementines (both fruit diced including rhinds) in secondary.  It finished quite sweet (but not cloyingly so) with NO rocket fuel taste at all.  1 month in primary, 2 months in secondary with no additional racking.  Yeast that I used was the WPL 099 Super yeast that said it would do 25%.  It never got past 19%, but man it is VERY smooth even right after bottling.  


**UPDATE** OK so for others who are looking at these, I found that the folks at [High Gravity Brew](http://www.highgravitybrew.com) Don't double bill you for shipping!! So I got them shipped for the $189.  Regardless of from whom you buy these, they're drop shipped from the manufacturer.   

ALSO, the leg setup is kind of chincy now, it's not as it is pictured on either homebrewing.org or highgravitybrew.com.  The new legs only have a single support, not the top and bottom one, and the strap attaches to the unit just over the racking spigot, not around the body itself.   They seem MUCH more cheaply made, and don't feel all that sturdy.  I am going to make myself a stand for them using some large diameter pipe, so I'm not going to return them, but if you're less handy than me...beware of the crappy legs!"	t5_2rcsz	True

My instructions say to add the fruit in the first fermentation, and that when the time comes I should add pectic enzyme along with everything else suggested for the first fermentation. 

But if I want to add fruit later, should I not add that pectic enzyme until I add the fruit? Is there anything I'd need to do if I were going to add it when adding fruit for the second fermentation? If I add it in the first fermentation and then the fruit later, during the second, will the pectic enzyme still do its work?

I've got some questions regarding racking and aeration:

* I've seen references to racking multiple times to aid in clarification. How many iterations of this is too much assuming I'm letting it sit for 9 months. (Aug 2013!)

* It seems aeration is mentioned in some recipes and not in others. Even then, there's a wide continuum of how, how often, and when to aerate. What works best for you?

It's fizzing along nicely, the balloon has stayed on, and a nice white foam as formed at the top of the container. 

So, should I follow the directions and wait 3 weeks before tasting it? Then, should I remove the orange slicers and raisins? Also, can I then put the mead into some glass containers to see if they clarify?

1344470191.0	xwsme	Making my first mead and acting like a mad scientist.  What hath I wrought?	Tacoeconomy	12	3	14	"So way back in February, I decided to make myself a mead.  On February 29th, I pitched some Lalvin RC 212 into a 5 gallon glass carboy with 15 lbs of clover honey, an ounce and a half of vanilla extract, some all spice, some cinnamon, some lemon juice, and some cloves.

Sometime about a month later I read that pitching yeast into mead without any yeast nutrient can produce off flavors, and that this is especially true with RC-212.  Without any easy access to yeast nutrient, I quickly racked the mead and then filled the remainder of the fermenter with water I had boiled grape nuts cereal in (after straining out the grape nuts!).  Also tossed in about a cup of boiled molasses and an indeterminate amount of brown sugar (a cup or two)

Everything seems to have worked fine up until this point.  I allowed this to age, racking every so often.  And by mid-June I was sitting happy with about 4.25 gallons of mead sitting in my 5 gallon carboy.  Then disaster struck:  after speaking with some seriously seasoned brewers and mazers, I realized that the .75 gallon of air at the top of the flat mead in my carboy could be oxidizing the whole thing!

""What to fill the space with, *what to fill the space with*?"" I agonized.    Water would make the mead too watery; the mead was perhaps too strong to begin with, but that sounded like far too much water.  I could have mixed more honey and water, but I wanted to let it age and not have to rack again.

Then I remembered the 4 one liter bottles of cider I had bottled in mid-January.  I had pressed the apples that I had picked myself in the northern Catskills (upstate NY), and pitched champagne yeast into it.  They had been bottled after 2 months with one racking after the first month.  Overall the cider tasted great, but was quite weak.

So I racked my carboy full of mead, poured in the fizzy 4 liters of cider, which I thought might take care of any possible oxidation at the time.  But there was still room at the top so I added two quarts of some fancy schmancy alkaline water that has Dr. Oz on the side and a pH of [8.8](http://www.evamoralkalinewater.com/).  

After all this, everything was going swimmingly.  I kept checking to see how the mead was doing: totally flat and noticeably clearer.  I quite like how clear it has gotten, you can now read large type through the carboy.  Regular size text would not happen.

BUT NOW something is amiss: fermentation has restarted!  Starting exactly three days ago the airlock has been bubbling again, after one month of no bubbles!  And I definitely suspect the champagne yeast from the cider(pitched in December).  Now I'm not sure how there are any sugars left to ferment, as when tasted this is a seriously dry wine, but the yeasties are most certainly working away.  Not vigorously, only about a bubble a minute(s-shaped airlock), but the bubbles coming up the side of the carboy are definitely the tiny fine champagne bubbles.

1338480463.0	ue14o	Bottling Question: Corks or Caps?	tevoul	10	1	27	"So after starting up 10 or so 1 gallon batches and getting some good preliminary results I'm ramping up to larger 5 gallon batches. As a result I'm going to start bottling in full 750 mL bottles (instead of smaller bottles to let me taste every month or so and still get a solid 6+ months of aging out of a single gallon).

In looking at the options I can either go with a screw cap or corks for the sealing method. Now I think we can all agree that corks are far more classy, but they are also more effort and carry the risk of [cork taint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_taint). As such I was wondering if there was a significant benefit for mead if you use corks instead of caps - I know that corks supposedly aid in the aging process in traditional wines, but I'm unfamiliar with exactly why or if it would apply to mead. I'm also quite uninformed on the authentic vs synthetic cork debate.

1337377667.0	ttvn2	A couple questions on yeast and oak in mead...	tevoul	11	0	5	"So I've been a mazer for a few months now and have a few batches tasting quite good thus far (still sitting on them as much as I can and only opening a bottle every month or two to check up on it!) but I have a couple questions as I start to move into slightly more complex recipes.

First I'd like to talk yeast. I've been using Lalvin D-47 as it was recommended to me for melomels (I'm experimenting around quite a bit to get a nice blackberry mead recipe to make regularly), but as we are moving on into summer my apartment is heating up a bit. I usually keep it around 70 in the summer but it can rise a bit warmer on the hot days, and I've heard bad things about D-47 and &gt;70 degrees. Can anyone recommend a yeast or two that would work for me year round (think 60-75 degree shift) and still maintain a lot of fruity/sweet flavors? I've been aiming for sweet to semi-sweet meads, I'm not a huge fan of particularly dry ones.

Second, I've been thinking I want to experiment with using some oak in mead recipes - I'm a bit of a beer snob and my favorite beers are all stouts aged in oak bourbon barrels, so I wanted to see how that sort of flavor transferred over. I've read [the document on it](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwMEz0IKBaldU0hGOXFrdFlUZmlES0Y2Yy1oZGZJZw/edit) linked from the sidebar which leads me to believe I'll probably want to opt for cubes that are American medium toast (I like me some vanilla/spiced/woody flavors) - anyone have some experience with this that wants to give me a little insight?

Also I'm curious what various recipes people think would be good to put oak in. I was thinking about trying to do it in a bochet (I started one of those a couple weeks ago and the must tasted/smelled amazing), but if people had other recommendations I'd love to hear them.

And of course, have some mead porn!

[My fermentation area](http://i.imgur.com/NOEom.jpg).

- 4 (center two small containers) is a blackberry melomel that is just finishing clarifying after I racked it off the fruit last week, it will be bottled sometime in the next week or so

- 5 (behind 9 at the left) is a high ABV acerglyn (maple mead)

- M6 (back row right) is a black cherry melomel (using juice instead of full fruit, I'm curious to see how it being juice rather than fruit affects the flavor)

- M7 (front right) is an apple cinnamon cyser (using the skyrim recipe listed in the /r/mead recipes!)

- 8 (front center) is a vanilla metheglin, using the recipe listed in the /r/mead recipes

- 9 is a bochet (nothing fancy about this one, I just wanted to see how a straight bochet turned out)

[Bottles of my first few batches that I'm trying to forget exist so I don't drink them all too early](http://i.imgur.com/tl3Xr.jpg). M1 is a blackberry melomel, M2 is an acerglyn (and a fucking delicious one at that), M3 is another variant of the blackberry melomel."	t5_2rcsz	True

Here's what I've made so far, with notes.

* JAOM - A great starter mead. This recipe came off quite sweet, which I discovered was not my preference at all.

* Pumpkin - Ew. I think I did this wrong.

* Strawberry - My first ""own"" recipe. I don't remember how much fruit I used, but I just finished a bottle of this marked Feb '11 and it's still amazing. Did a second batch and it didn't turn out quite as well. Take notes on what ya brew, kids!

* JAOM - Much better than the original. I used better yeast on this batch and it turned out nicely. 

* Straight mead on local honey - Best thing I have ever tasted. Literally. The orchard I visited produces blueberries as well as peaches, and you can taste both in the final product. I made 5 gallons of this for my upcoming wedding.

* Chocolate-Cherry-Chipotle - I call this ""Black Betty,"" and it's been the most frustrating mead I've done so far. I did just a 1 gallon size as a tester. First, cutting up cherries by the pound is a BITCH and you look like a murderer for several days. Next, something between the yeast nutrient and the cherry juice causes a chemical reaction. My mead was DARK BABY SHIT GREEN for the first couple weeks of fermentation. It turned back to a dark red eventually though.

* Straight mead with POM added after I forgot to make anything out of it. Needs bottling."	t5_2rcsz	True

The comment thread describes why things should be done as they should.

Makes a tad bit more than 1 gallon. You will need:
Coffee (preferably whole beans, but if not, one can). Make sure it's gourmet coffee and not one of those instant craps or watered down version of coffee.
3 to 3.5 lb's of honey
1 gl of water
One of those steeping socks thinguies
airlock, 1 gl glass bottle or carboy or whatev's, yeast. I'm going to make mine with either an extra D47 I ordered or with ale yeast. choose whatever you think will work.

FYI I suck at actual measurements because I don't have any proper equipment.

Step 0: SANITIZE! But that goes without saying.

Step 1: Steep about half a can or a bit more of coffee over night on the gallon of water. Do not boil anything. Just let it steep at room temperature. If you're going whole bean, slightly grind whatever amount you want (depending on how strong you want it) and steep just the same. Now you basically have cold brewed coffee (less bitterness). Remove left over coffee waste.

Step 2: Bring the coffee water thingui to a boil (without the actual coffee) and boil for about 5 minutes. This is for sanitation purposes.

Step 3: Remove kettle (pot) from heat and let it cool off a bit. Preferably to a room temp.

Step 4: Add and dissolve honey. Make sure you get you get your yeast started going more or less now.

Step 5: Cool down the must to about 70-80F (if it's still warmer than that) and pitch the yeast.

Step 6: Pour into container of choice, or siphon it, or whatever method you prefer, and shake the living hell out of it to airate it.

Step 7: Ferment. Then, when you rack for secondary, add some more coffee (not too much, specially if it's pre-ground. Whole beans are the preferred way to go in this step).

Step 8: Rack again in about 2-3 weeks so the mead doesn't get too much of the coffee bitterness.

Step etcetera: Now you just re-rack how much you feel like it until it clears out and is ready for bottling.

OP notes: I have not tried this recipe myself, so if you feel you have some suggestions or if something should be done differently, go right ahead and add your comments. I will edit as necessary.

1298094276.0	focxi	New to making mead - just starting my third batch.  The story up to now - I've learned a lot!	obsidian468	9	0	7	"I just started making mead. I've only barely started my third batch (about a week ago).  I have a lot to learn, but I've also already learned so much!  I also just found this subreddit.

My first batch was a starter kit that I got for Christmas that included honey, spices, and directions.  It was a winter style spiced mead kit.  The instructions had me performing the entire process in a single gallon sized water jug.  It also stated the mead would be ready to bottle in two weeks.

Boy, were those directions wrong.  I followed them exactly, and bottled the mead when exactly two weeks had passed.  The bottle I drank with a friend that night was still sort of bubbly, had tons of sediment in it, and tasted a little yeasty.  In hindsight, this should have been more than enough warning for me.

I had learned enough to know that first opening the last bottle filled was the best way to avoid bottle rockets and get a nicely settled and still mead.  That's what I did the day I bottled it.  I left the other three bottles resting on my kitchen table.

About a week after bottling, I was enjoying my weekend and watching TV when I heard a loud pop in the kitchen.  When I went to investigate, I found that one of the bottles had rocketed.  That was one hell of a mess to clean up.  Lesson learned - need patience.

My next batch was a blueberry mead.  It was still fermenting in a plastic water jug, but having done further research, I bought a second water jug as a secondary.  After two full weeks, I racked the mead into the secondary.  In the secondary, I let it settle one week at room temperature, and a second week in the fridge.

Not having a hydrometer (or even knowing what it was at the time), I wasn't sure that fermentation had completed.  I did know, from my baking education, that yeast doesn't do well at near freezing temps in the fridge.

I bottled the mead at a month into the process.  I've been keeping the bottles on their sides in the fridge.  Flavor is very good (though a bit on the sweet side for me).  Alcohol content is okay, but could be higher.  Zero bottle rockets.  A small amount of sediment in the bottles.

I was more patient, but still not patient enough.  I want sediment free mead (or at least so little sediment so as to not be noticed).

My current batch, I went further.  This is an ""herbal healing"" batch, using spices that are common in herbal teas.  I bought a 1 gallon winemaking kit (2 gallon primary, 1 gallon glass carboy, and a few tools such as a siphon, airlock, and cleaning equipment).  At the moment, it's been in the primary for about a week.  Tomorrow, it will get briefly opened to sample the batch (my girlfriend is coming by tomorrow, and she's fascinated with the process) and to get a hydrometer reading.  I want to know what the alcohol content is, as well as how much longer I need to keep it in the fermenter (estimated, as I know the hydrometer reading before adding yeast, and seeing how close it's gotten to 0 potential alcohol in the past week).

I figure I'll be racking it in the next week to week and a half.  After that, it sits in the glass carboy until it looks nice and settled - probably another month.

I really try hard to not use additives such as Camden tablets in my mead.  Depending on where my current batch is when I hit the bottling deadline (about a month and a half from now), I may or may not use Camden tabs - I'm just taking a bottle to my mother, and flying out there.  I really don't want an exploded bottle of mead in my checked bags.

That was about a month ago. Checked it this morning and noticed that I had bits of orange starting to sink, and a couple of the elderberries have sunk.

I didn't really follow any recipe, but I read a bunch of stuff about brewing and mead, and then just kinda went at it (this is my usual strategy for cooking, and it worked for the cider pretty well). I mixed 7kg of honey with about five gallons of water and five teaspoons of yeast nutrient (as per package directions). I heated the mixture up to about 40 degrees Celsius, which was the temperature the yeast said to use to reactivate it (I reactivated it in a separate mixture of just water, but I figured that starting the whole thing off at that temperature would give the yeast a good start—perhaps this is horribly wrong).

I did this saturday afternoon, and there's not much activity going. It's not bubbling, but I can see that the airlock *has* moved and there's some dead yeast on the bottom, so I know it didn't die right away (if it has indeed died). I'm worried because by this time on the cider, it was bubbling away nicely and there was *a lot* of yeast floating on the top.

Is it natural to not see much activity at this time (about two days)? If the yeast has died, can I save the mead by pitching new yeast?

I forgot to take a picture, but it's already pretty clear and will only get more clear as the settling and aging process continues. I figure I'll let it settle in the carboy for another couple of weeks, and then bottle when I figure out if I want to use real wine bottles w/ corks, or 22oz beer bottles with caps, or if I want to use something like Pellegrino resealable screw bottles. I'll likely end up going with corks to be classy, but we shall see.

As for the mead itself, I started with a specific gravity of 1.06 @ 63°F, and my ending specific gravity is .993 @ 68° f, which leaves me with an alcohol by volume of 8.9%. I'm slightly disappointed with these alcohol numbers - I should have used more honey in the starting batch so that the yeasties could have more feasties and convert more sugar to alcohol. It's all good though. Next time I'll use more honey at the beginning and end up with a stronger wine.

The mead is a very light champagne color - looks like a white wine as I'd expect... To this untrained palate, it tastes dryer than a sauvignon blanc, but not as dry as a chardonnay. I have also not let it age at all - I am also aware that I'm comparing a honey wine to grape wines, so the comparison may be very off - but at least it gives anyone who's not a mead person an idea of what it tastes like.

I like it, and will be doing this again, for sure. Though next time maybe I'll experiment with adding some additional flavor profiles - Raspberry? Orange? Only time will tell!

Thanks again to everyone at /r/mead for their help and encouragement!  I probably could have done it without you, but it certainly wouldn't have been as fun!

I started them around July of this year and left them to ferment/sit until September when I racked it by pouring it through a funnel with coffee filters in it. It tasted bitter (very woody), and continues to taste about the same, even after I filtered it again a few weeks ago (I thought it might have been an issue of sediment, because there was still some of the original must in the bottom of each jug).  I've been using glass jugs, which have been sitting on the counter of our kitchen. Could light exposure be part of the problem?  I've also heard that pouring instead of siphoning when racking can aerate it too much.  The recipes I used were fairly simple- 4 or 5 pounds of honey, then organic apple juice+a cinnamon stick in one and just water for the other.  I believe the yeast I used was called Premier Cuvee.

Another question, how would I go about deciding how much yeast to put in it if it's just a small batch? Or is just easier to make an entire batch but ferment it in several small containers than in one larger one?

And for the ultimate noob question: How long is the secondary fermentation supposed to be? How does that part work?

Well, the next thing I know, a year and 3 months has gone by and it's still in the carboy.  I decided to sample it again, just to get a reminder, and wow!  It had a strong Honey-maple aroma, then, when it first hits your mouth it has a sourness, not unlike a green apple and then it just explodes into that honey maple taste.  It is amazing.  It's quite dry, but not acidic and its running between 18 and 20% (I didn't adjust for temp).  Now, it's bottling time and I want a good name for it, but I'm drawing a blank.

1350011752.0	11cj8b	Guidelines for making braggot?	TheJollyLlama875	9	3	17	"Beer brewer here, and I was wondering if there were any good guidelines for designing a braggot recipe. BJCP guidelines and my typical resources like BYO seem to be awfully sparse. This tells me that it's very open to interpretation, but I would like to know if there are any best practices.

All I seem to have found so far is that I ought to avoid really harsh flavors (excessive hops or too much roasted barley/black patent malt), and generally that darker recipes work better.

I do have several questions, though.

1. Is there a minimum OG I ought to keep in mind? I'd imagine that a darker, smaller beer could easily overshadow a proportionate amount of honey. Still, most of the braggot recipes I see are 1.90+ gravity. Could you scale it down (to, maybe 1.065 or thereabouts) and get a substantial honey flavor, or will the malt just drown it out at that point?

2. I've seen a few recipes just say ""Crystal Malt"" and don't really tell you what kind. Just adding any sort of Crystal can make a seriously huge difference in a beer. But what's the point, anyway? Just adding body? Isn't the honey sweet enough?

3. From what I understand, hop presence ranges anywhere from none to sparse. Should I just add hops for bittering? Has anyone experimented with aroma or flavor hops, or do they just totally fade? And is there anything to be said for using the crazy citrusy West Coast hops, or is this a style best made with noble hops?

4. Would it be a good idea to just take an extract recipe for something like a Doppelbock or a Wee Heavy (both traditionally high gravity, malt-emphasized styles) and swap out some of the extract for honey? Or is there a general method of tweaking such things?

5. When mashing my grains, should I shoot for a higher temperature so it has more body? I'd imagine that would be preferable for a more beery braggot, but I could also see that being a personal preference thing.

6. Is acid and tannin generally added to braggots? I know beer is acidic to begin with, but we always fight to keep tannin extraction out of our mash. Is it just a given that the malt bill will add the balance and complexity that an acid/tannin blend will?

I know, the rule of thumb is ""if it tastes good, that's how you ought to do it,"" but given the amount of time that big brews like this take, I'd rather have other people's input.

And any other advice or good books on the subject would be much appreciated. I already picked up Ken Schramm's The Compleat Meadmaker, but there doesn't seem to be much there about braggots specifically."	t5_2rcsz	True

**[Dried Juniper Berries in Mortar and Pestle.](http://i.imgur.com/Ti3ss.jpg)** We cooked these 24 grams of berries with the total volume of 6 gallons. Juniper was in at 160°F for 10 minutes, during cooling, and left in for fermentation. We will be doubling the Juniper during secondary.

3 gal carboy - 3 oz fresh local sweet orange peel, 3 pods dried Star Anise.  
2.5 gal carboy - 3 oz dried bergamont peels, .25 oz fresh local rosemary.  
5 gal carboy - 2 cups fresh local Kumquats, 2 oz fresh local lemongrass.

**[Kumquats and Lemongrass.](http://i.imgur.com/qmq6q.jpg)**  
  
As for the honey, we used 12 lbs of raw clover, 5 lbs of filtered clover (kirkland brand), 4 lbs of raw unfiltered Buckwheat, 1 lb of raw unfiltered carrot. I forgot to take a gravity reading from the must right out of the pot, but got some from the kumquat/lemongrass after pitching the yeast. **[A whopping 1.135 OG.](http://i.imgur.com/8sSFR.jpg)**  
  
**A note on using dried spices:** my good friend, who bore the brunt of the recipe design, had us heat the dried spices over a low flame before using them. Specifically, the juniper berries and Star Anise pods were 'loosened up' in a pan prior to their respective uses.  
  
**A note on yeasts:** we made two 4-gram, 500ml starters using the dry D47. For the starters, I used DME, Fermaid-K and Go-Ferm yeast nutrients. I started the starters on Thursday night and we pitched them (after mixing them together) on Sunday evening. We also put DAP, Fermaid-K and Go-Ferm into the must while dissolving the honey and steeping the Juniper. Cheers!"	t5_2rcsz	True

I'm not entirely convinced, so I came here in the hopes that someone could tell me whether they thought this was a bad idea, and maybe give me pointers on how to best go about it.

[Jack Keller's winemaking page](http://winemaking.jackkeller.net/) include some recipes for mead, and he appears to take the same approach to winemaking and winemaking:

* primary takes place in a bucket that is freely open to oxygen but has a fine-weave cloth rubber-banded firmly across the top
* when vigorous fermentation subsides, strain into carboy for secondary and airlock. Rack as necessary.

[Storm the Castle](http://www.stormthecastle.com/mead/make-mead-1-brewing-the-must.htm) goes this way:

* primary takes place in a bucket with an airlock
* siphon into carboy and airlock for secondary fermentation

[WikiHow](http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Mead) appears to skip the primary/secondary steps altogether, and goes straight from fermenting to bottling.

[Makemead.net](http://makemead.net/recipes.aspx) has a similar airlocked-primary airlocked-secondary approach to Storm the Castle.

I've been following Jack Keller's methods because I was focusing on melomels with fruit in the primary as well as in the secondary, but seeing the variety of ways to do this is really making me lose faith in the idea that something that's not what I would consider drinkable after three months will be so after a year.

1316810329.0	kpffx	My melomel experiment using fruit and berry juices.	paleolithic	8	1	5	"This year I tried an experiment to determine which varieties of juice are good for making mead.  Thought I'd share it here.

I started with a 5 gallon batch using 15lbs of orange blossom honey, Lalvin D47 yeast, and a hefty dose of raisins in primary.  I added no additional nutrients.

I let it go until fermentation slowed (a little over a month), then racked to secondary in various 1 gallon jugs on top of 1 quart (32 oz) of juice in each jug.  The juices I used were black cherry with a whole vanilla bean, cranberry, blueberry, and pomegranate.  I also had enough left over for a gallon of orange blossom sack mead and a gallon of maple mead.  

Of the juices, the black cherry fermentation was extremely quick, and no additional nutrients were needed.  It finished up and clarified within 2 weeks, and I bottled it.  It was already drinkable upon bottling, but had a strong alcohol burn to it.

The other juices required additional nutrients for the fermentation to really kick in.  The pomegranate finished next, and the flavor was also quite good upon bottling.

The cranberry and blueberry are still fermenting slowly, in spite of an additional nutrient addition.  They've begun clarifying, so it seems that they are wrapping up currently.  The flavor of the cranberry is on par with the pomegranate.  The blueberry, however, has a distinctly uninteresting flavor.  I'd say for a blueberry mead using juice, some additional components will be necessary for a good end result.  I may try a citrus addition of some sort.  

Based on the results of the black cherry fermentation, I did a 5 gallon batch of black cherry vanilla which has already finished.  I bottled it last weekend, and again it was drinkable on bottling, though will definitely benefit from aging.

EDIT:  I bottled the cranberry and blueberry today (11/6/11) after a couple months of bulk aging, and I have to say they both turned out well.  I think the cranberry will be an excellent addition to Thanksgiving dinner this year, and the blueberry has smoothed out nicely with some light sweetness and blueberry notes, much better than the first tasting.  The cranberry remains slightly cloudy, while the blueberry cleared up completely with a nice dark red color.   "	t5_2rcsz	True

* 2 3-gallon carboys
* 1 6.5-gallon primary fermenter
* Appropriate bungs and 3-piece air locks

I currently have ~25lbs of wildflower honey (got it locally for less than $2 a pound!) and am planning on making a 5-gallon batch (traditional semisweet) and a 3-gallon batch (metheglin).

For my traditional mead, I am planning on step-feeding and staggering the nutrient additions. I am going to use a method that a local meadery uses. It will be something like this:

* Day 1 - Put together the must. Only add 1/4 of the honey and nutrients. Pitch yeast.
* Day 2 - Wait
* Day 3 - Add 1/4 of the honey
* Day 4 - Add 1/4 of the nutrients
* Day 5 - Add 1/4 of the honey
* Day 6 - Add 1/4 of the nutrients
* Day 7 - Add the last of the honey
* Day 8 - Add the last of the nutrients

I plan to degass every day until day ten or so.

I am planning on using Lalvin 71b-1122 for my yeast. I believe it has an alcohol tolerance of around 14%. Is there anything special I need to do to make sure my mead gets into the 12%-14% range? Also, since I will be step feeding the honey, how do I get OG? Just check it initially, check it before each day that I add honey, check it after I add the honey, and the difference should be added to the OG? When I do check the gravity (for the method I am using, it will be quite a few times in the first week), can I add the must back to the fermenter (as long as everything is properly sanitized each time)?

Mead has held my interest for awhile, so I figured it a nice place my to devote my first homebrewing attempts. After doing some research though, I am slightly perplexed as to the ""best/right"" way to make mead.
Guides like [this](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f85/making-mead-step-step-165675/) and the various JAOM guides all make it seem so simple. Just add water, honey, yeast, and optional fruit/spices and you're off on your boozy adventure. 
Other references though seem to indicate that it really isn't that simple. One needs to factor in staggered yeast nutrient/energizer feeding along with the process of racking numerous times as to avoid the yeast imparting unwanted flavors. 
All I really want to know before I finally go out and purchase my equipment is what is ""essential"" and what is ""helpful"". In terms of the taste I am going for, I am fine with it being ""non-traditional"" and/or ""weird"" (in a good sense if you catch my drift).

I have a previous post where I got my question about acid blend answered fairly well, but im not really that sure what tannins actually do. How do I know if my mead needs tannins?

I have also heard that maltodextrin, which doesnt ferment from what iv heard, can add ""mouthfeel"". is this something people use in wines/mead? or is it mostly for beers and such? could I cut it half and half with honey, and use that to backsweeten? 

My first batch, instead of using marbles to take up extra space in the carboy, I just topped off with water. That, coupled with the fact basically ran them to completion, made for a very bland mead (almost no honey flavor, almost like alcoholic water) since they were just sack meads with nothing else. Could it benefit from tannins, or using a mixture of honey and maltodextrin to backsweeten?

If I use a juice of some sort instead of water, for calculating stuff, can I take the sugar content of the amount of juice i am using, and put that amount into the mead calculator as plain sugar to help with calculating everything?

I havnt checked the compleat meadmaker yet but I do not really remember seeing anything like that in there.

I consider myself on the lower-end of an intermediate home brewer having brewed a whole bunch of extract beers and a couple ciders. Since beer rarely needs yeast nutrient, I'm very unfamiliar with how they work. I was unaware that cider needed them, and as a result they came out a little hotter than I was expecting due to, as far as I understand, increased fusel alcohol production which was in turn due to unhealthy fermentation.

I've looked all over the links in the sidebar trying to find this information. I found the ""Staggered Nutrient Addition"" document in the Google Drive folder, but it was a bit confusing to me. When are you supposed to add the yeast nutrient? While you're preparing the must? Before pitching the yeast? After?

I've been a homebrewer for a couple of years, but I'm interested in making a mead since a lot of my friends don't care for the bitterness of hops. I just have a few questions before I get started.

First off, equipment. I have the standard beer-brewing stuff: 6.5 gal brew buckets (1 for primary, 1 for bottling), 5 gal glass carboy (secondary), racking cane and hose, 12 and 22 oz brown glass bottles, and a ""Red Baron"" bottle capper. Anything else I'd need? Do I need to worry about any beer aroma/flavor getting into the must?

As for the mead itself, I want to start with something sweet—probably a melomel. I'm looking at the [melomel kit from Midwest Supplies](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/midwest-melomel.html), but I'd prefer to use actual blueberries instead of the extract. I'm guessing the fruit goes into the secondary when it's racked instead of at bottling time, but I don't have any idea how much to use for a 5 gallon batch. Difference between frozen and fresh berries? Do they need to be thawed or processed before adding them?

Nektar bourbon barrel mead a few years ago when they came out with the first batch and really liked it plus I have started to become more of bourbon barrel aged fan in my beer too.  I have been thinking of making a bourbon barrel aged mead for some time but never really had the time until now.  

Now, since I don't have the equipment/space/time to get a used bourbon barrel, make 55 gallons of mead, and age it for about 2 years I am going to have to do a shortcut method to get the flavor profile I want.  I pieced some of this together based on some recipes I found using bourbon barrel beers and I think this should work.  Here is what I have so far...

Recipe:

* Batch Size: 6 gallons 
* Target SG:  1.108
* Target FG:  1.010 (Want to keep some sweet in there)
* 18# Wildflower (I found an old recipe where they used a 4.8:1 ratio of orange blossom to buckwheat but I was thinking wildflower would be interesting unless someone else has any ideas)

Secondary:

* 16 oz Bourbon (haven't decided which one yet, thinking Maker's due to cost)
* 2 oz toasted American Oak cubes that has been soaking for ~2 weeks
* Keep in secondary for ~ 1-2 weeks and rack off

What are your thoughts on this one?  

I am also thinking it might be interesting to substitute scotch for bourbon and make a scotched mead. Maybe like a JW double black would work in this case since the price is right and you would get some peat smoke."	t5_2rcsz	True
1367887899.0	1dtx4i	Newbie here. I have some questions and would appreciate suggestions.	rdp1408	8	1	15	"Okay this is probably going to be a bit long winded. I want to start by detailing the process of my first batch. My first batch was a 1 gallon batch of plain mead. I used 3 quarts of water, 1 quart clove honey (say my notes, thinking back I believe it may have been 1/2 quart), and 1 packet of Lalvin EC-1118 yeast.

Process:
I poured the honey and the water into a pot and brought it up to 170 degrees for 15 minutes while stirring. After that I let it cool to room temperature. I took out a cup or two of the must and mixed the yeast into it for a couple minutes. I then poured the yeast mix into the 1 gallon carboy followed by the remainder of the must. I then airlocked it and stored it in a cool dry place for 8 weeks. After the 8 week wait I siphoned the mead into mason jars and put them in the refrigerator. I tried it immediately and quite liked it. If I had to liken it to something I would say it was fairly similar to Strongbow hard cider with a little less of the cider taste.
[Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/QGb8u#0)

As far as questions go, I have a few.

1. Is the process I followed a good process (for now I'm more focused on a speedy process, I'm trying to have my batches this weekend ready to drink by August at the latest.)
2. I'm looking to make another 3 batches this weekend. (3 gal. plain, 1 gal. blackberry, and 1 gal. strawberry-kiwi (US Gallons)). Would the above process, yeast, and honey work for these batches?
3. How much of the fruit should I use and how should I prep it? (I was thinking I would get it tomorrow, clean it and freeze it for a couple days, and then thaw it out for making the mead this weekend)
4. Is one packet of the yeast enough for each batch? (3 gal plain, 1 gal blackberry, and 1 gal strawberry)
5. Finally, the yeast I bought came in a 10 pack. I have 9 left. They have not been stored in the refrigerator or anything. Are they still good to use?

I would very much appreciate your input and answers. Thank you!!

It's been almost 2 months, and now I am going to rack it and want to pitch another yeast to get it down more.

I figure if it started at 1.190 and that strain of yeast has a tolerance of 12%, it got down to about 1.090 (I don't really want to test since I only have 1 gallon and plan to age this for quite some time considering the strength). This is super sweet, so I was thinking of pitching another yeast to eat it down to about 1.020-1.030 range and just having it be a ""dessert"" cyser or something.

* What type of yeast should I use? Ideally i want something that won't diminish too much of the belgian character from primary fermentation, if possible.

* How much yeast do I need? I figure I have 1 gallon of ~12% mead around 1.090.

What are potential dangers of drinking a ""bad"" mead?"	evozoku	7	1	18	"I started a cyser just about one year ago, and I'm ready to try one of the bottles.

1360975462.0	18m29g	Mystery mead or how you really shouldn't forget to take the OG.	Sarkhon	8	1	6	"Four months and a half ago, I made a blueberry honey mead. Used 9kg of honey with enough water to have 6 gallons, 
so something around 16.57L of water and 6.43L of honey (yeah, useless decimals). 

-6 gallons batch

-9 kg/19.8lbs of unpasterized blueberry honey

-1 L of apple cider as a starter

-2 packets of Lalvin EC1118 yeast

-16.57 L of water.

After initial pitching, I learned of the lack of nutrients of honey and made a starter with 1L of apple cider and a new pack of yeast (Lalvin EC1118). It started fermenting happily.

Only problem, I lacked a hydrometer and couldn't take the OG and there lies the problem.

After 2 rackings, the mead is still cloudy (probably from the apple juice) with a somewhat (bad reading on my part) steady gravity of 1020 for ten days.
It's slightly carbonated (Wtf mead?!), which makes it difficult to appreciate the taste. 

It's going to sit in the corner for now, at least until June. I'll rack it 2 or 3 times since then.

Question is: is there any way to guess what the OG could have been? And is 1020 normal for the amount of honey made?"	t5_2rcsz	True

For 23 liters of mead i used:  
7 kg flower honey  
0.8 kg frozen bilberries  
0.4 kg frozen strawberries  
0.4 kg frozen mixed berries (red currants, bilberries, strawberries and blackberries)  
10 g bentonite  
5 g DPA and 1 ts of wyeast beer nutrient (staggered nutrient additions, I added half now)  
2 packs of lalvin 71B-1122 yeast  

I blended the frozen berries and added a bit of pectic enzyme. I boiled the nutrients and the bentonite. Then i added my honey and some water and stirred untill the honey had dissolved. Filled up water to 23 liters and shook the bucket like crazy. I then added my yeast and shook some more. Its now in my closet at about 20C, hopefully my airlock will start bubbling soon.  

For secondary I will add even more berries (3-4 kg) and some chipped, lightly toasted french oak. I have brewed a few beers and some Apfelwein berfore, but I don't have that much brewing experience. I really hope this mead turns out good, it was a fairly expensive brew, the honey alone cost me 450 kr (~80$).

* water to get to 5.5g/21l

Yesterday, we kegged almost 5g/19l and filled 9 bottles.  SG was 1.002.  About 10% alcohol, which is about what I wanted.

I have no experience with kegging and the friend helping me only has limited experience with kegging beer.  I'm looking for advice on the procedure for getting some good carbonation in it and at what psi/bar to dispense it.

We put 20psi/1.4b on it to seal the keg.  There was some talk of rolling the keg around.  Is that a thing?  

The keg will be stored in 65-75F/18-24C for at least 6 months before I try it again.  Should I change the pressure in the keg?

First, one of the directions in the JAOM recipe is to ""dissolve honey in some warm water.""  This seems like an important step.  What is the best way to do this?  Just heat up some water in a pot, add honey, and stir?

Second, when is the time right to take an initial gravity reading?  Right before adding the yeast?  How about the final gravity?

1358946937.0	174c32	Holy foam!	Lord_Nuke	10	1	30	"So, about a week after I pitched some english ale yeast for my pumpkin pie mead, after it had foamed up as usual and settled down, I had been reading online, here mainly, and various sites on the internet, and saw that adding some raisins would benefit the yeast a fair bit. So I picked up some raisins. Or even better, I thought. Blueberry juice infused craisins. I followed instructions online, rehydrated them in water I had boiled, sterilized all equipment I was to use, etc, and gave about a quarter of a cup of them to the mead.    

It sure liked that. Airlock activity increased considerably, and bubbles have formed on the top. Sort of like soapy suds looking bubbles, rather than the standard yeast foam. It still smells fine and all, and isn't discolored or anything, so I don't think it's infected, it's just going crazy. It actually foamed up into the airlock overnight and I had to clean it out.    

Is this normal? Did I actually screw it up, despite the fact that it still smells right? (well, it's starting to smell rocket-fuel ish now, but still smells ""right"" if that makes sense.) Is it just this sudden abundance of bonus sugar and nutrients that has the yeast all fired up?

Today I bottled my first brew, a hydromel. I used the hydromel recipe dating from the 17th Century from Sir Kenhelm Digby (http://www.solorb.com/mead/recipes/digby.txt). Now, I'm sure every recipe is different, but I'm wondering how a hydromel is supposed to taste. Mine is not very sweet, and tastes like a watered down mead. I'm sure I'm going to get a ""Duh! Hydromel is watered down mead,"" but when I tasted the mixture as it was boiling, it was sweeter than what I have now. Does aging have much to do with the taste,? Home-brewing is new to me and I'm just wondering if I messed up along the way; I did have some variations from the recipe due to my inexperience, and I will list them...
I believe I added the pack of ale-yeast too soon to the must, as it was warmer than ""blood-warm."" Believing I killed the yeast, I added two tablespoons of active-dry-yeast once the mixture cooled. Would active-dry-yeast affect the flavor? Was this a stupid thing to do?
Also I left the sliced ginger, cloves, and rosemary in carboy during the primary fermentation. Should I have filtered everything out before fermenting?

Lastly, as most of the home-brewing world is new to me, I felt that I should ask this question as I continue to research: how do I add carbonation to an alcoholic beverage?

So im making my first 5 gallon batch and its been plagued by beginner issues but we're working past that. The short story is I put 16lbs of honey in 4 gallons of water with some earl grey one week, the next week I took out a gallon and put in ~15lbs of fruit (wild blueberry 10lbs, and mixed cole bags of strawberry/rassberry/blueberry ~5lbs)

Two weeks later I have a gallon of traditional mead that probably could have used more time with a tea bag, but is sweet, is still fermenting (constant foat, but only a small ammount~1 centimeter) in a gallon jug. 

The rest i've babied a bit (a weekly stir , not to vigorous to release co2) but has no head (i attributed this to the fruit cap). 

So I'm moving to glass carboy now and I'm wondering whats going on. the SG was 1.1 as I read it (the calculator said it should be 1.15) but my current gravity is something like 1.01 ie close to the starting position marked on the hydrometer. 

I thought that the hydrometer would get lighter (ie move towards 1.0 as the sugar was eaten) but then drop (as alcohol fermented, towards what the hydrometer says were the appropiate gravities for stuff). But im still up at 1.01. 
I don't think my fermentation has been hijacked. The containers smell nice (the 4 gallons fruit smells fruity/floral, the traditional a touch alcoholic), they taste like  I expect (the fruit like a cheap red wine, tart and kind of cherry red in colour , the traditional carbonated, honey tasting and a touch yeasty) but I thought the hydrometer would be sitting low as I was aiming for a desert honey kind of deal.

As i have been tasting them, they are obviously alcoholic. Did i cook up a batch of off-alcohols (the weather and apartment has been cool, althought i did use a heater belt in the last going off) cause im a little drunk off drinking them, or did I hit my goal of big sweet sack wine and im just not experianced to know what that is or has something strange happened.

1345807151.0	yqym7	Looking to make my first batch of mead for my sister's upcoming wedding.	SanFransicko	8	1	4	"My little sister has been my brewing assistant for several years, and I'm a fairly competent home beer brewer.  we made five gallons a week for quite a while but I've scaled it back and only do one a month now.  She and I have always talked about making a mead, and have researched it off and on for years but just never got around to it.  Well she's getting married in three months and I've told her to stop asking about it for the time being and to not snoop around where I keep my carboys, so she knows, but I still want to wow her.  

My wife is going to be my helper and she's already reading up on the process and the history.  There are so many variables, and I know I could make a simple batch and have it ready in a month like my beers, but I have a few ideas and a few questions.

I want it to be a true mead.  I want to taste the honey.  I'm all for adding maybe a spice or maybe a fruit, but for the most part I want the primary ingredient to be strongly honey.  I live in Northern California and I can get pretty much any kind of honey for $10/lb at the farmers markets.  For a 5 gallon batch, I'm expecting to need about 15 lbs?  

I also want it to be fairly strong.  If I'm going to invest the amount of time and energy into doing this, I want to see my friends get snockered.  That's just a general rule whenever I brew.  I don't usually fuss with anything under about 6% with my beers, and I'm shooting for closer to 15% with this.  I have a good relationship with my local brewing supply store and he's got wine yeast and champagne bottles so we're good on that.  I also have, I expect, any equipment I would need.

If possible, I would like to have a little bit of sugar remaining at the time of bottling so that it will carbonate like champagne (or beer), because this is for a wedding after all.

Some questions I have:
With beer, one of the functions of the hops is to distract from the sweetness of the grain's sugar and the funkiness of the yeast.  Does mead require anything like that?  I've read that things like dandelion have been used historically for this purpose.

I've heard of some meads that need to be refrigerated after bottling, lest they explode.  Why?  Is this because they are much more carbonated than beer?  Like the cage on a champagne bottle?  I don't need it to be that bubbly.

What should I avoid using if I want to have this batch in it's bottles in a month and a half?  I think if I had two months in the bottles, it would have enough time to mellow out and get ready, so that leaves me with about six weeks to ferment it.

There's a guy at my brewing shop who's brain I will pick.  He's active in all the renaissance fair stuff and has made several batches.  I would appreciate any tips from you kindly folks before that, so I can go in there and ask all the right questions.

**EDIT:** Sorry to have been away for so long, everybody.  I am at work on a tugboat and things have been busy for the last couple of days.  Tonight is going to be busy as well.  I appreciate all the feedback and will take all of your advice under consideration.  Further down the road, I will plan to make a mead that can sit on the shelf for years and mature, but at the moment I am working with an inflexible deadline.  I should have begun last time I was off, but work came up as it always seems to.  Also, I am hard-set on making a product with closer to a 12-15% alcohol content, so I will be using wine yeast.  I have used staggered nutrient additions for barleywines in the past but not recently.  Maybe I'll start with a smaller batch than my normal 5 gallons.  My local mead-mentor assures me that a good product can be made in the time I've got.  I will, of course, keep you posted."	t5_2rcsz	True

I was able to get 8 pounds of hand picked blueberries so I decided to take a stab at it and have procured about 16 pounds of honey. I was initially thinking about using this recipe http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f80/blueberry-mead-34038/

&gt; 5 lbs Frozen Blueberries  
&gt; 16 lbs Honey  
&gt; 5 tsp Yeast Nutrients  
&gt; 2 tsp Yeast Energizer  
&gt; 3/4 tsp Pectic Enzyme  
&gt; 5 Campden tablets  
&gt; 3 packets of Lalvin D47 Yeast  
&gt; 
&gt; Mix 13 lbs of honey with about 1 gallon of water. Shake until your arms are tired. I use about a half a gallon of &gt; hot water from the tap per half gallon of honey. Pour into fermentor and add one gallon of room temp water. &gt; Add nutrients, energizer, pectic enzyme and crushed campden tables. Allow blueberries to completely thaw and mash them with your hands to just crush or split the berries. Add the blueberries to the must and cover for 24 hours.
&gt; 
&gt; Make a yeast starter with a cup of water and a cup of the must, around 84 degrees. Add the yeast and make sure it is working. Pitch the yeast after 30 minutes and stir to suspend.

&gt; Be careful how much water you add at this point as the blueberries will rise to the top start to swell. Not over 3/4 full in the fermentor. Cover with a towel or something that can breath. You need the O2 now. Stir every day for 10-14 days. Rack off into secondary and top off to proper level. Put the Air-lock on the secondary and rack about every 30 days for 4 months. Add 1 lb of honey for the next 3 rackings for a sweeter mead. It should not be in the dry range but it is much better in the semi-sweet range, the yeast should take this to about 14.5% ABV before it is overwhelemed.

HOWEVER:
After reading through this forum a bit I am wondering if it might be better off to split it into multiple batches using different fruits and see how things go (requiring me to buy some 1 gallon jugs). Or, better yet, even start off with one gallon batches instead of a full 5 gallon batch.

1340313941.0	veho2	Mead frisson	Jo-Sef	8	1	10	"   I have about 20 one-gallon batches going now, and every once in a while when I have people over we go down to the cellar and take samples.  The other night, I bring my friend and his girlfriend down to the cellar and start showing off my meads, some of which are okay, others I feel are amazing.  We get to one of my two favorites; my friend's girl takes a sip, and when she finishes she just says ""oh my god....look"". She pointed at her arm which was covered in goosebumps along with the rest of her body.  She went crazy for the mead and I thought wow, I've never seen someone get goosebumps from a drink before.  
   The next day, another friend came over with his girlfriend.  We go downstairs, get to that same mead, she sips it, and boom - she starts exclaiming ""oh my god it gave me goosebumps"", and sure enough she's got it too.  Two girls in a row.  Has anyone else ever experienced this or have I stumbled upon something great?  Anyone else have meadgasms?  For those who might want to know what the mead is - it's a traditional with a nice, dark wildflower honey from a farmers market, aged on french oak, and it finished at 1.016 w/ an abv of 16%. 

EDIT - if anyone wants the recipe I can post it and you can try your luck

EDIT - RECIPE:

* 2.5 pounds wildflower honey 
* 1.5 pounds clover honey 
* roughly .3 oz french oak chips 
* water 
* Lalvin D47 
* Yeast nutrient 
* Yeast energizer

EDIT - I used half of one packet of D47

O.G. = 1.138 
Target Final Gravity = 1.016

I suggest following a typical SNA schedule. I only added a small bit of nutrient after pitching and some energizer when it was about 2/3 of the way done. I still have not racked this mead after 7 weeks, and I don't plan on it until somewhere around the two month mark to let the oak hit maximum extraction without overpowering the mead. Right now there is a great balance between oak and honey. This one was a great success for me, especially since it was so well received and tasted great after only 1 month, but also because it turned out exactly as I was expecting - I even guessed my final grav on the nose on brew day. Part of what must be making this mead so good is the quality of the honey. The clover was just store bought processed stuff but the 2.5 pounds of wildflower were purchased from a farmers market and had to be the best honey I've tasted yet - so make sure you get good stuff!

For those interested in the goosebumps, they occurred between the 5 and 6 week mark just days after fermentation was complete. I'm hoping that whatever that is increases with age :)

I started a blueberry melomel about 3-4 months ago and after the yeast had dried it up nicely and started to die off due to high alcohol content ~17% (Lalvin EC-1118). I racked and backsweeted with about 12 oz of honey and a handful of blueberries to the gallon. After letting it sit for about a month and a half it was marvelously dark purple and clear. I then wait a few more weeks just to make sure it was done throwing off sediment and racked it to a new container for its final wait to be bottled. Its been about a week now and the bottom of the jug is still completely bare of sediment and the fermentation has long since stopped. However when the container is shaken or disturbed it kicks up a just a little bit barely pushing off a bubble or two for a few seconds after. 

I am wondering how you guys make sure that a fermentation is complete so you don't end up with a sticky explosion or unintentional champagne.

We made a 3 gallon batch with 8lbs of Tupelo honey, but split it into two containers (I borrowed a 3 gallon carboy from a friend, and put 2 gallons in it, and my friend is using a 1 gallon jug).  We ended up with a little more than 3 gallons, and our OG was 1.090, so it will probably be a little drier than we want it to be (to be fixed in secondary, hopefully).  My LHBS didn't have any yeast energizer, just nutrient (Fermax), but we went ahead and made the must, separated it into the two containers and put our rehydrated yeast (lalvin d47) in.  Is the lack of an energizer going to be a problem?  

We did this 2 nights ago and our fermentation has finally picked up, but there hasn't been a 'head' that formed on the top of the must like I have seen in almost all other pictures of primary fermentation... Is that a sign that something has gone wrong?  The carboy is in my closet in a dish full of water with a wet towel around it and a fan blowing on it, and my airlock is currently bubbling once every 3 or 4 seconds, but it took a while for the fermentation to pick up and this is currently the fastest it has been.

I guess it wouldn't technically be a cyser as (from what I understand) that would require it to be 50% honey. Here's what I've been thinking:



5 gallons apple juice from concentrate

10lb clover honey

Montrachet Yeast

Nutrients (Fermaid K or other)



Ferment until it clears completely, kill yeast and possibly back sweeten with apple juice concentrate and/or honey. Rack to secondary or bottle.


My understanding is that this would yield around 17% abv, which seems a little high. Also, what would the expected time to age this be before it was drinkable? The original apfelwein recipe takes about 4 weeks to clear, after which it is drinkable, but it improves a lot with as much as 6 months of aging. I would like a product that is drinkable as soon as possible (preferably within few months) My understanding is that adding honey would significantly increase the required aging time, but this could be minimized by decreasing the abv which could be done by decreasing the amount of honey to something like 5lb.

* What kind of hydrometer to buy to test out the alcohol level?
* I'm a bit confused as far as levels of alcohol. I understand with more sugar can at times, mean more alcohol (which is why I want the hydrometer), but will that make it stronger?
* When I rerack for the secondary, should I rerack to a sanitized jug, then clean the primary, sanitize, etc. or should I just rinse it our?
* Or should I secondary rack into the bottles (which would let me start another few batches)?
* After three weeks, all of my meads are pretty cloudy, is there a rule of thumb to wait, or should I add a chemical to clear it?
* How do I know if/when I want to backsweeten? I'm guessing after reracking the mead to the secondary (which it should stay in secondary for several more weeks)?

NumberOneTheLarch	8	0	21	"So I decided to use the basic gallon mead recipe found on a couple of websites a couple of months ago, and now I have two gallon glass jugs with some very nice looking mead in them in my closet.

I believe they are still fermenting, as I can see little bubbles rising up. Also, on the bottom of both is a very think cake-looking layer of what I guess is dead yeast.

My question is this: should I wait the whole six months (my chosen minimum time to start drinking it) to bottle it, or bottle it now?

Also, should I be racking it to get rid of that cake? Will it affect the flavor if I leave it alone any longer?

1) Does the fermentation process smell bad? Or strongly (whether good or bad)? I live in a faculty apartment of a residence hall on a college campus. It doesn't appear that brewing (or fermenting) is against any rules (only distillation is expressly forbidden), but I would be worried that the smell (if there is one) might be too strong for the limited space we have.

2) Is the process easy to screw up? From the tutorials that I've read online, it *looks* relatively straightforward, but it seems the entire fermentation process can take upwards of multiple months. I think I would get really discouraged if I spent all that time patiently waiting for delicious mead, and my batch went bad so I had to scrap it and start over.

I figured 'I don't want to worry too much about food sanitation, so I will just wait until there is a boatload of booze on up in there before I throw the food in.'

A lot of the melomel discussion I see around here lately seems to point to making a syrup from the fruit or bagging the fruit, and leaving it in for the first part of fermentation... Well, that all sounds highly suspicious to me, I think I like my way better, but I have never made a melomel before, so what do I know?

Anyways, what do you guys think is the best plan for throwing the fruit on in there?

I have a couple of plans at this point:

* Chop up a buncha fruit, drain off some fluid from the carboy (drink it) mush all the fruit down in there, give it a good shake, forget about it until it shuts up, rack off of the lees and spent fruit, chill for a bit.

* Chop up a buncha fruit, mash it down into a fresh, clean carboy, rack ye olde mead out on top, MAYBE add a little slurry too, then:
  * Chill out for a little while, re-rack.
  * Chill out for a serious long while, bottle.

* Something else reddit suggests.

What say ye, my hale and hearty brethren in booze? Is there a good plan to be had here?

Now, I have three 5 gallon carboys of mead at various stages of development sitting around my room at this very moment, and none of them are exactly what one could call 'clear'. 


Even my six month old jobbie is still mighty foggy, though definitely a lot more clear than he was a couple of months ago.


I am curious: Does the cloudiness effect the ultimate flavour of the mead? When I have sampled a cup or two during re-racking, I find it delicious, if a little 'green' tasting, but I always think that there is some sort of ghostly taste hiding in there from the cloudy particulate matter floating about.


So, /r/mead, I would like to posit these questions: 


* Does reddit have an opinion on cloudy -vs- clear in terms of ultimate mead taste?


-and-


* Do you feel that the Super-Kleer K.C. compound effects the overall taste of a finished mead, and if so, how?

I made a Joe's Ancient Orange mead in one of my 5-gal carboys and bottled it about three weeks ago. Then I sanitized the carboy with Io Star (an iodine sanitizer) and let it dry out until today, when I sanitized again, gave it a nice scrub with a carboy brush to get anything sticking around off the walls, and racked my latest mead, a nice blueberry (pre-racking gravity about 1.002%, which gave me an alcohol level of 13.67%), which I then proceeded to add a few more pounds of blueberry too (in puree and whole form both) in order to compensate for the dryness that crept up on me unawares. However, I only noticed after the fact that there are a few spots of residue left over inside that must have been particularly interested in their current real estate and didn't want to vacate. 

So now I'm afraid there's something in there that is not going to be kind to my mead. I ordered a few Campden tablets that I'm going to toss in there--they should be here in the next two days. Will that ensure that nothing untoward happens to the mead? Also, is it a decent guess that since I used Lalvin 71B, which has 14% tolerance, that the tablets will be enough to more or less knock further fermentation out of the picture so I can backsweeten, bottle, and cold crash in roughly three months, which is my overall plan?

[Here’s the Album of all five pictures I took during](http://imgur.com/a/adHba)

I bought some 6-gallon better bottles in the fall when I saw a by-one-get-one, and decided that I would primary in those, and then rack to a 5 for secondary/clearing, so this weekend I went to a HBS (sadly, I can't really call it a Local HBS as it's a half hour away) to get a 5 Gal, and stopped in at a Tea &amp; spice store for my spices.
(I will be adding the spices in secondary)

The Recipe in Primary: 

* 1 Gallon of Meadowfoam Honey 
* 1 Gallon of Queen Anne’s Lace Honey (about 7-8 pounds were used, but I’ll adjust gravity at racking from the remainder)
* Filtered water to 5 gallons (next time, I’ll spend the $5 on bottles to save myself the time of having to filter it myself)
* SNA that will total 5Tsp of DAP and 2.5Tsp of Yeast Energizer, done in 5 steps.

Spice Additions for Secondary, in muslin bags so they can be removed as they reach the flavor levels I am looking for:

* 1 Ounce of Green Cardamom
* 1 Ounce of “true” Ceylon Cinnamon
* 1 Whole nut of Nutmeg (probably not going to use the whole thing)


Process:

* Measure and mark the levels of each gallon on the 5 gallon Better Bottle, measure and mark out the 5 Gallon level on the 6 Gallon Better Bottle.
* Clean &amp; Sanitize everything. 
* Filter 4 gallons of water into the 5’gal. (same water that I drink regularly, I think it tastes pretty good, but this took forever, next time I’ll probably buy bottled water to save time)
* Warm a large pot of water to 110º F &amp; warm the Meadowfoam honey to make it easier to pour through funnel into the 6’Gal, get impatient and pour it while it’s still very thick. 
* While waiting for the last quarter of the first gallon of honey to go through the funnel, warm the Queen Anne’s Lace honey, add honey until bathroom scale shows that I have a total of just over 17lbs.
* Warm a half-gallon of filtered water to 110ºF, pour a pint or so into the empty honey container and shake to glean all remaining crystals. Add to fermenter while still warm.
*Add the rest of the warmed (now slightly less than 100ºF) water, and mix with drill mixer.
* Boil a half cup of filtered water, pour into sanitized glass, add 1/2Tsp. table sugar, let cool to 105ºF, add yeast as per directions on 71B yeast packet for re-hydrating, and let it sit until I’m ready to pitch. 
* After a couple minutes of stirring, add water to 4.5 Gallons, mix 5 more minutes, take first Gravity reading, which came in expectedly low, add QA honey to approximately 19lbs total. Add a bit more water (over shot my 5-gal mark while trying to wash as much of the honey off of the funnel into the fermenter) Mix and re-sample, reach gravity of 1.134 @ 80.8ºF and call it good enough.
* Add first SNA addition of 1Tsp DAP &amp; 1/2Tsp Yeast Energizer, Mix for another minute, incorporating as much air into the mix as I can, pitch Yeast (foamy little buggers), move to where it’s going to live until secondary, Cap and Airlock.


SNA Additions:

* Second 8/5/13: 1Tsp DAP, 1/2Tsp Yeast Energizer (didn't have time to degas, will do that tonight)
* Third 8/6/13: 1Tsp DAP, 1/2Tsp Yeast Energizer after degassing with a drill attachment (lost about 1/2 - 1 cup to foaming over, glad I did it in the sink!)
* Fourth 8/7/13: 1Tsp DAP, 1/2Tsp Yeast Energizer after degassing by capping, shaking and gently releasing pressure, for about 15 minutes, until very little pressure was being released. (no must lost, will continue to use this method rather than the drill... also easier to clean up before &amp; after as there are fewer things that come in contact with the carboy and must, so less sanitization is needed)."	t5_2rcsz	True

I hadn't seen any bubbles at all, and today I decided to just add the energizer/nutrients in hopes of getting it going. About 10 seconds after I had added a tsp or so of this stuff, the whole mead foamed over in a diet coke-mentos-esque eruption. What in the great gods of Odin happened?

When i looked back i realized i used 12 pounds of honey instead of the recommended 15; i was trying for a medium mead. also when i racked the mead in mid march i lost about a gallon to spillage. 

My solution to this problem was to add a gallon of water and another 6 pounds of honey to get it from being very dry and make it sweet. i added the honey and that gallon of water about a week ago. i plan to let it sit for another month to ferment and then add some clarifying agent just to get this batch over with. i really want to move on to my second batch but i dont want to waste this one if its salvageable. 

essentially what im asking is do you guys think ill be able to save this batch or should i just start over from scratch?

This first batch has definitely been a learning experience and i already know a bunch of things i plan to do differently with my second batch to improve.


Edit: Thanks for your replys. Ive decided to just tuck it away for a few more months. See how it is then "	t5_2rcsz	True

Based on gravity reading, I mixed it in amounts that should produce a 10% abv final product if it ferments dry. Given the alcohol tolerance of the yeast, there's no reason it shouldn't ferment dry. After getting my gravity reading, I mixed in a tablespoon of pure cocoa powder (no sugar) and mixed it nice and thoroughly. It's been fermenting for a few days, and the cacao nibs I ordered online have just arrived.    

As per [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/mead/comments/1dzp07/minor_variations_in_mead_recipe_leading_to_longer/c9vkdue) it was suggested that cacao nibs may be roasted. So we come to the core of my question here.    

I want to use some cacao nibs in my mead, in addition to the powder, to give it a rich, full featured cocoa profile. Should I roast my nibs? If so, at what temperature and for how long? I asked the original poster, but it's been a number of days, he doesn't seem to be frequently active on here, and with the nibs having arrived, I want to get this underway as soon as I can, even though I know a few days won't matter much in the scale of years.    

I've got a 1 gallon batch started now, and in January, assuming all seems well in said test batch by the time I get to January, I'm going to start a much larger (11-12 liter) batch. The plan is to leave it in primary for a year, to really take on the flavors of the cocoa, and then to rack into secondary, and age it for a second year, to age out the bitterness of the oils in the cocoa.

Making my first batch here, a 2 gallon melomel using wildflower honey and a little loquat juice (only a little). Pitched it 3 days ago and fermentation is off to a great bubbly start!

I've read about the use of staggered nutrient addition, so I've been doing that a bit each day. However, many guides recommend a final nutrient addition when the fermentation has reached a 1/3 sugar depletion. This seems to be an important point in the fermentation for many reasons- also the last point at which you should aerate. Unfortunately I do not have  a hydrometer, so I dont know what my original readings would have been nor how much they have changed since then.

I've had a Renascence Fest mead (Minnesota), a store bought mead (it had a bee on it?), they were both okay, a little too sweet for me, I'm looking to try some more dry meads, and that's what I'd like to make, because most alcohol I like dry.

But when I was in San Diego, I went to the Oceanside Brewery and they had a mead they made on tap. It was a cloudy and had a slight head, but it wasn't sparkling at all. I loved it, it seemed me what I was hoping to find in mead, not that sweet, nice honey flavor, sort of thick mouth feel. Seemed almost more an ale than a wine. I assume as a brewery they used a process they'd maybe use for brewing beers?

Is there a name for this style of mead? Or was it just an unfinished mead that maybe they didn't let sit long enough to clear? I'd assume they know what they are doing, being in that business.

Cappings are the mixture of honey and beeswax that you get when you shave the combs off the frames. My question to you is whether or not it is possible to use this for making mead.

My plan at the moment goes like this:

1. Put cappings in a fine mesh bag and soak in tepid (~20C) water for a few days to dissolve the honey.

2. Remove bag of wax and set aside for refining for candles.

3. Supplement resulting must with honey to adjust SG (if necessary).

This process will circumvent the need for excessive heating of the honey, thus preserving the more volatile compounds.

* 1/2 package of Wyeast 1968 London ESB yeast

It also smells, in my opinion, a bit fruity. Well, the air coming out of the airlock does. I think it's pleasant. My roommate thinks it's gross, but he's the sort that, if he walked into the room with a blindfold on, would probably ask ""What smells like fruit?"" but where he saw me put it all together, pitch the yeast and all, asked what the yeast was about and what it does, would think ""That's the smell of fermentation, gross."" (super picky person)    

What's a way I can explain what causes the smell? I'm thinking it's probably due to the honey being broken down. Like how blueberry honey takes on some properties of blueberries, I'm thinking as this is a general honey, it's probably got various local fruit and flowers in there, and as it gets broken down for sugar and whatnot, the smell would be an after product.

It is extremely dry, so I have some questions. Before that, here's the recipe I used adapted slightly from one I found at stormthecastle.com:

* 3# clover honey
* 1 tsp. yeast nutrient
* 1/5 cup peach-ginger tea
* 1 vanilla bean, sliced lengthwise
*  Water to one gallon
* Permier-Cuvee yeast

OG was around 1.112. It has been in the primary for a month and most visible fermentation has stopped. When I transferred to secondary last night the gravity had dropped to around .995 or so. It tasted very dry. Virtually no residual sweetness. So here are my questions. 

First, why did it end up so dry? Did I simply not have add enough honey up front? How can I be sure I add enough honey to my next batch without adding too much? 

Second, how do I best go about backsweeting this batch? From the preliminary research I've done it looks like there are three main ways: (1) killing off the yeast with campden tablets or the like, then adding honey, (2) adding unfermentable sugars, and (3) adding more honey to let fermentation carry on until the yeast dies off naturally due to the alcohol content then add enough sugar or honey to sweeten. To the untrained eye, the third method seems the most attractive. Can you suggest the best/preferred method and provide some specifics about the actual process?

For 3 gallon carboy:

2 Gallons Pure Organic Apple Juice
6 lbs Pure Organic Honey
1 oz Cinnamon Sticks
Yeast Nutrient
2 packs Lalvin 71B-1122


So far I understand that I need to make the must by heating the apple juice and honey in a pot, and stirring it vigorously. Then I pour the must (once it reaches like 75 degrees) into the carboy for primary fermentation. I add the yeast nutrient and then pitch the yeast (how much?)

I think I'm supposed to test the gravity before I pitch the yeast, and then check it again once the airlock calms down. I'm not sure how to determine a proper gravity.

1353297354.0	13floz	Question on flavor	pashman1977	8	0	2	"Hi all,

So I have a mead going that has been brewing away since may.  It was a 5 gallon batch made with 15 pounds of white honey and a bunch of fresh mango.  The fruit was placed in primary and fermented using Lalvin 71B.

Fast forward to today.  2 rackings and crystal clear.  No sulphite or sorbate used.  I decided to break out the wine thief and take a sample.  It fermented dry as anything I've ever tasted.  But it is bland...  I mean there is a slight hint of a very smooth aftertaste that I can't quite put my finger on.  Almost buttery for a lack of better words.  But other than that it's just plain bland.

So now here I am wondering what I can do to breathe some life into it.  I was thinking of sulphiting and sobating and going into a sealed primary with about 3-6 pounds of raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries in a sterilized hop sock and throw the airlock on and let it sit for 3-6 weeks.

Any feedback or ideas would be greatly appreciated.  I don't want to commit this batch to a bland death.  Honestly I thought that the mango would throw more flavor.

On another note the idea to toss more fruit at it is also to backsweeten a little."	t5_2rcsz	True

Today, a friend of mine with a refractometer helped me assess the progress of my meads. We got some specific gravities, but were not sure what to do with them. These were the first measurements that I took so I can't compare the numbers I got to the ones from the start. I thus thought it'd be useful to ask you guys about my meads. 

All of these have 3lbs honey, spring water, and Lalvin 71B-1122 yeast and are in 1 gallon glass carboys.

The first mead was started on July 17. It has a cut up orange as well as some spices. This mead has been bubbling like crazy from the start, and is still the strongest out of all of the others. I used 25 raisins as a yeast nutrient in it. As of today, the specific gravity is 1.040.

The second mead is a pumpkin pie mead that I started on 7/18. It has 15oz of pumpkin purée as well as some pumpkin pie spice and 25 raisins for yeast nutrients. This one has been bubbling pretty well, but not as strongly as the 1st. The specific gravity is also 1.040. We actually racked this one because there was a big cake of pumpkin purée and yeast at the bottom. Tried a few drops, and it's sweet and very strong, but delicious.

My final batch is a lychee melomel that I started on 7/29. It initially fermented like crazy but has come almost to a complete stop. The specific gravity on it is 1.046. Rather than raisins, this one got yeast nutrient. 

I think the first two meads are doing ok, it's just a matter of time for them. Would you guys agree? The last one may be a stuck fermentation. I am not sure what to do. Maybe add more yeast or add more nutrient?

I have come up with four options. But first let me tell you what happened. This is the tragic tale of my chocolate peppermint mead. She is only 5 days old.

How I got here was due to two key events, either one of which alone could have led to inevitable catastrophe. First of all I haven't pitched the yeast yet. Due to a family emergency I had to leave right in the middle of finishing the mead. I had heated my water, added the honey, cocoa, peppermint, yeast nutrients/energizer and was waiting for the yeast's rehydration water to cool to 110 when I found out my dad had been in a car accident and was in the hospital. So I put the air lock on the mead and planned to return in a few hours and pitch the mead. However, the second mistake was not putting any water in the airlock.

I've just returned, five days later, and what an upsetting sight. There appears to be a huge mass of mould and bacteria sitting on top of the mead! I took a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/sYL5p.jpg) and optimized it for the new iPad's retina display so you can get a good look. [Here's one](http://i.imgur.com/eklYW.jpg) from the top.

My first thought was to suck off the gross stuff with a shop vac and resterilize the must with a quick boil, but then I noticed that there is an active fermentation. I took a [video clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfFGXJrcUHg); I recommend clicking the option for 720p. You can see the bubbles and spices floating around in real time. I didn't speed it up!

Perhaps the dead yeast hulls in the nutrients came back to life and I now have Zombie Mead?!

My four options: Sterilize the mead or not and pitch my yeast (D-47) or not. What do? Option 5, throw it away because the mould is toxic or it tastes like vinegar? 

**Edit/Update:** Thanks everyone. I thought saving this mead would be impossible but thanks to you I now know it's merely incredibly unlikely! I like those odds. The higher the risk the greater the reward!

my primary fermented like a mad house for 4 days and stopped, I had to leave town and didn't have time to check or rack it for an additional week, I let it sit until this past Saturday when I racked it into a new container, onto new fruit. I took a gravity reading of 0.993 before the new fruit, forgot to check after the fruit because I'm a genius like that. I decided to try something, and rather than just using whole frozen/thawed blueberries, I put them through my (properly sanitized) blender so that they wouldn't do their floaty trick and cause further airlock blow-outs/overflow, figuring that I can run my final product through some cheese cloth to remove the fruit bits when I re-rack later. hope that works out as planned, if not, I'll know not to do that next time.

so far things seem to be working out ok, the brew has a great deep purple color, smells of blueberries but also a little yeasty with a touch of alcohol, haven't tasted it at all yet. 

which brings me to my reason for posting: other than waiting, what should I do now? there has been a tiny bit of action since adding the new fruit, but not much (it's still bubbling, but very infrequently, intervals of more than a minute)

the tale of the recipe so far:
&gt; ‎3Lbs. of Orange blossom &amp; Clover Honey, 2Lbs. of formerly frozen Blueberries (one in primary, one in secondary), 1tsp yeast nutrients, 1 pouch of Red-Star pasteur yeast (hydrated and bloomed with about a tsp of honey until nice and fizzy before pitching), water to 1Gal.

There's some pictures of my brewing corner, and the honey I used. Although, funnily enough the honey label says that it's 1 lbs, but of course it's actually 12 lbs. So this is a 'Cyser', although I'll be calling it a Mulled Cider Metheglin when I bottle it because I don't happen to like the sound of the word Cyser. Recipe follows;

* 12 lbs. Oregon Raspberry Honey
* 4 gallons Apple Cider
* 1 oz. pulverised Anise
* 1 oz. Sweet Orange Peels (Or Bitter, if you prefer that)
* 5 crushed cinnamon sticks
* Lalvin D47

Another matter is the choice of yeast. I'm conflicted between Narbonne, Steinberg, Assmanshausen and Tokay. However, so far I've only tried Narbonne, so I really don't know anything aside from what I've read. Any thoughts from the wiser mazers here?"	t5_2rcsz	True

recipe:

* 1.75 liter bottle of water
* 400g organic buckwheat honey
* 100g molasses
* 1.5 grams ec1118
* 1 tsp crushed raspberry (for smells! :P)

method: basically followed the 'basic recipe' in the sidebar... but i really didn't want to throw in acids like orange or use cinnamon. then subb'd for some molasses instead.

I think I over did it on the yeast but I don't mind rackin it if it's gonna be too strong... mostly concerned that it doesn't have enough food for the yeast.

I was planning after a month, to split it half and half between pear and an apple juice... would it still do some fermenting after cutting it in pear or the apple? or a bit more yeast because I've given it more sugars to snack on?

a month after cutting it, I'll probly call it and get people over for some barbaric dinner and booze tasting :P

mostly worried about food for the yeast. I only recall using EC once for a batch of apple cider that went all vinegar because of crappy apples and not sanitizing equipment properly. I do make myself bread at home all the time and I use honey instead of sugar as a starter, and it works just fine. yeasts gotta have the same basic needs dont they? a sugar and some water that isn't hot? :P

1336047138.0	t4yyr	How goes the cysers? Here's the recipe I have in mind. Help me out?	Toastyparty	8	1	11	"I just want to make sure I've got the measurements down. Also, I kind of always guesstimate the appropriate DAP/Fermaid-K/Go-Ferm amounts using the side bar info and ""The Compleat Mead Maker,"" but if anyone who already has this shit down better than I, please go ahead and recommend dosages. Also, what other ingredients may I use here that will go well? All recipes that have been made in collaboration here have been my best resulting meads yet.

Primary:

* 3.5lb Clover Honey (easiest to get, although I'm trying to get my hands on some (pretty expensive) varietal honeys they are selling in Marshall's - these include Lemon Blossom Honey, which is the best smelling honey I've seen/smelt, and others of that sort)
* Roasted apples - caramelizing some apples either in a BBQ or in the over. About EDIT: ~~2-3~~ 6 apples. I think the caramelized apple sweet taste is perfect for a cyser. What do you guys think? How's the amount? ~~Very lightly mashed~~ Ran through a juicer.
* I want to keep my spices out of it, but maybe a cinnamon stick?
* Go-Ferm/Fermaid-K/DAP appropriate to batch, SNA style!
* ~~D-47!~~ Montrachet Yeast! Made with starter. Do you think 71B or Montrachet Wine Yeast will work better?
* Pectic enzyme
* That is all. Simple!

Secondary:

* Probably won't rack it off of primary for about ~~2~~ 1 month. Let the yeast grab those yummy sugars from the apples and such.
* Once taste tested, if the caramelized apple taste is well hinted, I might go ahead and put in a White Oak chip, medium roast. Rack off at about 2 weeks.

Tertiary:

* Wait until it's aged enough and BOTTLE! (Don't forget the sulfites and sorbates)

Once again, the fermentation took off like a weasel on cocaine and dried out pretty much before leaving primary (1.10 to .995 in primary after one week)  It's down to about .992 now and hotter than hell, with no sweetness at all.

I'm looking to make a nice blackberry mead (I believe it's a melomel technically). How much honey should I use per gallon? I see some recipes with far more honey than others. Some say not clover honey, while others use solely clover honey. I'll be buying some nice organic honey from a local store that sells 5lb for $25 in big jars.

How much blackberry should I use? Would it be better to use whole blackberries or a jam with the only ingredients being blackberry and cane sugar (organic)? Perhaps some of both would be best?

Some recipes seem to get it all together in a bottle, then rack about 2 weeks in then leave it. I've seen others that have three stages of adding yeast and energizers along the way? What would be best for what I'm trying to accomplish? Pros and cons of both techniques?

My rough idea of how to proceed is as follows:

1) heat some water and dissolve honey and maybe blackberry juice or jam.

2) fill carboy with more water up to 6gal

3) add blackberry fruit

4) add (how much?) yeast (EC 1118 I think was the one suggested, but I don't know the difference)

5) add [DAP](http://www.hillbillystills.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=ADDMON&amp;utm_source=googlebase&amp;utm_medium=shoppingengine) and [Fermaid K](http://www.bacchus-barleycorn.com/catalog/fermaid-k-fermentation-nutrient-2-oz-p-4771.html?utm_source=googprod&amp;utm_term=25535) (how much?)

6) Let it sit for 2 weeks then rack

7) let sit for 3 months then bottle

I'll make sure to have sterilized everything along the way with [Star San](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/star-san.html) (suggested on this subreddit)

Any feedback is appreciated. Also, I'm moving soon. Should I wait to move before starting or would it be okay to transport a 6gal carboy of month old brewing-mead?

So, my question to you more experienced mazers: Do you have any guidelines of how much honey you backsweeten with to achieve a semi-sweet mead? A sweet mead?  Do you measure with change in s.g. or with residual sugar content?

This is my safe bet. I just sampled a JOAM I made with Lalvin D47 in December, and it is  just slightly hot and surprisingly sweet, but tastes great. I can see the piney juniper berries offsetting some of the sweetness.

* 3 lbs of Great Lakes clover honey [from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Great-Lakes-Select-32-Ounce-Bottles/dp/B001E5DZRU/).
* 1 whole orange cut up into eights with skin and all.
* 1 cinamon stick
* 25-26 raisins
* 8 dried juniper berries (crushed)
* 1/2 packet of Lalvin D47 re-hydrated per instructions on the packet.

**Batch #2: Juniper Something Mead (1 gal)**

* 3 lbs of honey
* 25-26 raisins (for nutrient)
* 8 dried juniper berries (crushed)
* A pinch of yeast nutrient dissolved in boiling water
* 1/2 packet of Lalvin D47 re-hydrated per instructions on the packet.

**Process**

The same process was used for both batches. Honey was left in hot (out of the tap) water to become less viscous. Fruit and equipment where sanitized in StarSan. Fruit was added first, then a bit of warm water, and then honey was dissolved. To dissolve the honey I shook the jugs something fierce, which served to aerate the must. Yeast was re-hydrated and pitched. Airlock with StarSan affixed.

The best I can do is ferment it around 68-72F. Hopefully this will not be a problem.

**Questions**

1) Some mazers here think that 8 juniper berries is a bit much, but others are adding twice as many per gallon batch. I have no feel for the amount, so I am hoping to adjust the amount of berries once I rack to secondary. Does that sound reasonable?

2) Obviously I haven't decided yet what to do with batch #2. Part of me wants to do a straight-up juniper mead, but I'm afraid that it will be difficult to mask any mistakes I make with just honey and juniper berries. I'm open to adding berries, spices, or hops to secondary. One particular idea I had was dry-hopping with Centennial hops, which should add a citrus and floral aroma without any of the bitterness or flavor of citrus. 

2a) I'm also considering ""dry-hopping"" batch #2 with mint. Do you think the pine of the juniper berries might be too much with mint?

2b) If I add berries (they'll be the frozen kind from the grocery store), should I add them now into the primary or wait until I rack to secondary? Any other suggestions on what to add to this one?

My question is pretty simple but I want to do it right. How do I go about bottling it? There is some sediment at the bottom and some small amount of stuff floating at the top (doesn't look like much more than dead yeast that didn't sink). Obviously I don't want that stuff in my bottles. I'd also like to know if there is any adverse effect to adding some honey to it (to sweeten it up a bit) in the bottles. 

Thanks in advance for any advice."	t5_2rcsz	True

Someone told me to put some more yeast and honey in and the new yeast would get rid of that flavor.  I don't mind if I make it sweeter, I'll just use that as lady-killer mead.  What I need to know is, how much more honey do I need to add for a 5 gallon batch and do I need to aerate it, since I know the oxygen can introduce new off flavors.

Thanks!
