The right wing crazies are not just a threat for reasonable America, but for everyone. Besides that, I see similar things happening everywhere: a growing trend of fear-mongering and anti-intellectualism where opinions are equal to or better than the cold facts.

What the world needs is a new age of enlightenment. Not necessarily an atheistic or anti-religious era, but one that is adamant about the seperation between church and state, stands by the scientific method and aims to base all policies on honest facts, though they may be guided by a morality that is considered selfevident.

Restoring Truthiness is not the start of such an era, but the reasonable and intelligent people of the world need to be more vocal and better organised. The Colbert Rally may play a big part in just that.

So, hear this message from the rest of the world: America, Fuck Yeah!

So I make a living doing online advertising stuff, and one of the coolest things to emerge in this industry in while is Google's new TV Ads through Adwords.

It's incredibly easy, self-service, and surprising affordable. We could choose which network, TV channels, geo targeting etc. Even specific shows including Daily Show, Colbert Report or Glenn Beck depending on what direction we go.

The cost is about $1.50 to $4 CPM (Per thousand views) - If we raised $2000 here from all of us we could have our commercial viewed 1 Million times (@$2CPM), to the audience of our choosing, for example.

What we'd need to do here is come up with the actual 30 second spot. I'm sure there's some great video-making talent in our midst on this thread, please speak up if you are.

Collectively, if we could come up with the idea and messaging for the video, someone make it, and then collectively pool some money - We could get this on the air within a couple days.

What are your thoughts?

I'm sure there's going to be counter protesters, people who will bring signs and chants about ""God hates fags"" or some nonsense - we not shout at them and turn it into ""Who can shout the loudest.""

Instead, we turn out backs and don't even face them. Don't even give the meatspace trolls a single spot of attention. Don't shout at them. Don't respond to their taunts.

Treat them like we trained our dog not to jump on people: the entire family turns their backs until he calms down, and eventually he learned he wasn't going to get the attention his negative actions caused. If we do the same thing to whatever kind of trolls show up (either internal to Reddit or external groups), at least there won't be the media frenzy of ""protesters clashed."" 

They'll see one side being a bunch of screeching monkeys, and the others acting with dignity.

Just an idea."	t5_2s3hr	True

Write to your college newspaper about the Sanity/Fear Rallies.		334	29	38	"An article I wrote for my college newspaper was found (on reddit of course) and [mentioned by Colbert on his show last night](http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/359631/september-20-2010/march-to-keep-fear-alive-media-coverage).


After hearing this (and recovering from my shock), I wanted to suggest that each of you write to your own college student newspaper to spread the word of the Stewart/Colbert rallies. 


Every college newspaper I've heard of takes students submissions. It seems like a no brainier that each person can write in and get even more attention for the rallies (and [Donors Choose](http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=39361) if you can). Even alumni can write to their Alma mater, so you don't have to be college aged to write. I know print is dead, but they also put your stories online and it can't hurt. Besides, actually writing down what you think these rallies will mean could also help you THINK and REASON for yourself their importance and purpose. Isn't thought sort of the point?


My article is [here](http://www.thedaonline.com/opinion/stewart-and-colbert-gathering-may-be-defining-moment-of-generation-1.1606066). Of course what I wrote is only my opinion (and probably too serious and grandiose), but I challenge you to do better. Write a something hilarious, inspired, moving, or whatever you want. Since they are student publications, college papers usually have a very generous word limit compared to more established papers. If they don't publish, don't delete what you wrote, send them to me or post them here. I'd love to see the importance or meaning of this rally to each of you, whether it just be an epic troll, or the beginning of a new enlightenment."	t5_2s3hr	True

(*Emphasis mine, added for his most insightful and poignant comments*)

Thanks for joining us, I would love to say that we've got a great show for you tonight, not sure that's the case. We are going to have Dennis Leary in the studio, because quite frankly, after watching the news all weekend, all I want to do is visit with an old friend, and perhaps trade insults about one another's acting ability.

You know, it's hard to know what to say. Obviously, the events this weekend in Arizona weigh heavily. Sadly, it is a feeling that this country's experienced all too often, and unfortunately for our show, the closer that we have gotten towards discussing and dealing with current events, the harder it becomes in situations where reality is truly sad.

I can give you a typical compilation of the day's news excesses, but it doesn't really seem appropriate, and clearly none of our correspondents feels much like standing around ""reporting"", pretending to be in Washington.
...
So here we are again, stung by a tragedy. We have been visited by this demon before. Our hearts go out to those that have been injured or killed and their loved ones.

How do you make sense of these types of senseless situations?, is really the question that seems to be on everybody's mind. And I don't know that there is a way to make sense of this sort of thing. As I watched the political pundit world, many are reflecting and grieving and trying to figure things out, but **it's definitely true that others are working feverishly to find the tidbit or two that will exonerate their side from blame or implicate the other. And watching that is as predictable, I think, as it is dispiriting.**

Did the toxic political environment cause this? A graphic image here, an ill-timed comment, violent rhetoric, those types of things? I have no fucking idea. **You know, we live in a complex ecosystem of influences and motivations, and I wouldn't blame our political rhetoric any more than I would blame heavy metal music for Columbine. And by the way, that is coming from somebody who truly hates our political environment.** It is toxic, it is unproductive, but to say that that is what has caused this, or that the people in that are responsible for this, I just don't think you can do it.

Boy, would that be nice. **Boy, would it be nice to be able to draw a straight line of causation from this horror to something tangible, because then we could convince ourselves that if we just stop this, the horrors will end.** You know, to have the feeling, however fleeting, that this type of event can be prevented forever. But it's hard not to feel like it can't. You know, you cannot outsmart crazy. You don't know what a troubled mind will get caught on. **Crazy always seems to find a way. It always has. Which is not to suggest that resistance is futile.** It sounded pretty dark what I just said there, now that I reconsider it in my own head. ""Crazy people rule us all.""

I don't think that's true, but, and **I do think it's important for us to watch our rhetoric.** I do think **it's a worthwhile goal not to conflate our political opponents with enemies, if for no other reason than to draw a better distinction** between the manifestos of paranoid madmen, and what passes for acceptable political and pundit-speak. 

You know, **it would be really nice if the ramblings of crazy people didn't in any way resemble how we actually talk to each other on TV.** 

**Let's at least make troubled individuals easier to spot.**
----
And again, to see good people like this hurt, it is so grievous, and it causes me such sadness, but again, I refuse to give in to that feeling of despair. There is light in this situation. I urge everyone, read up about those who were hurt and/or killed in this shooting. **You will be comforted by just how much anonymous goodness there really is in the world.** You read about these people, and you realize that all the **people that you don't even know, that you have never met, are leading lives of real dignity and goodness,** and you hear about crazy, but it's rarer than you think.

And I think you'll find yourself even more impressed with Congresswoman Giffords, and amazed at how much living some of the deceased packed into lives that were cut way too short. And **if there is real solace in this,** I think it's that for all the hyperbole and the vitriol that's become a part of our political process, when the reality of that rhetoric, **when actions match the disturbing nature of words, we haven't lost our capacity to be horrified.** And please, let us hope we never do. **Let us hope we never become numb to what real horror, what the real blood of patriots looks like when it's spilled.**

**Maybe it helps us to remember to match our rhetoric with reality more often.** Because the reality of dangerous rhetoric is, I think, **even those that speak hyperbolically,** I think all of them tonight would absolutely recoil and say, wow, that is not the picture of what we were discussing and what we were talking about, and I **have to remember that there's a reality to that situation that we can't approach verbally.**

Because someone or something will shatter our world again. And wouldn't it be a shame if we didn't take this opportunity, and the loss of these incredible people, and the pain that their loved ones are going through right now, wouldn't it be a shame if we didn't take that moment to make sure that the world that we are creating now, that will ultimately be shattered again by a moment of lunacy, **wouldn't it be a shame if that world wasn't better than the one we'd previously lost?**

So, how will we process this tonight? Absolutely no idea. We'll come back, I'll show a field piece about something incredibly stupid and silly. Dennis Leary will come out here, he and I will most likely insult each other playfully. And then tomorrow, you know, we go back to trying to do what we normally do, which is highlight absurdity in a comical way that is a catharsis for people, and not a sadness. So thank you for listening. I know this is probably more helpful for me than it is for you. But we'll be right back."	t5_2s3hr	True

Jon Stewart and his team should host a debate at the national level between the highest-ranking members of the parties who are willing to participate.  

Neither major party nominee would be inclined to engage in an unorthodox debate like the kind Stewart would provide, but a strong movement to promote such a debate could pressure candidates / surrogates to participate or look 'out of touch'.

**THE OFFICIAL REDDIT AFTER PARTY!**

[Please RSVP here so we know you are coming](https://spreadsheets.google.com/embeddedform?formkey=dFM5Q0RYb3IwOFJ3bHpNVUN1NlhPZUE6MQ)

We'll have special guests from Donors Choose who want to personally thank all us Redditors who have donated so much to school kids everywhere.

There will be drink specials for people wearing anything Reddit related (official or not). We will also be introducing some of you to the new drink sensation known as *The Orangered*.

When this idea got started, [One Lounge](http://www.oneloungedc.com/) volunteered to host the party. Since then, we have grown to more than 1,600 redditors RSVP'd and counting. So here'd the deal:

Show up to One Lounge any time after 3PM this Saturday. There will be a list on their door with the names and locations of other nearby bars. Once One Lounge is full to capacity, hit up any of the bars on that list because they will all be open early **just for Redditors** and they will have **drink specials** waiting for you.

Look for a table with nametags: the big ones are for your name and the smaller ones are to write your favorite subreddits on. Then you can find your fellow sub-redditors in the crowd!

And here it is in bullet form because it's just easier to read:

* **What:** Come hang out with Redditors in DC
* **Where:** Starting at One Lounge (1606 20th Street NW) and branching out to nearby establishments
* **When:** Starting at 3PM and going officially until 9, but you can stay as long as you want after that if you're eating and drinking
* **Who:** Redditors and their guests (18 years old and up are welcome)

Keep checking r/colbertrally for any additional updates on mystery guests, the additional locations, and other special happenings you'll want to be there for.

**Edit:** Check out the list of official venues! http://www.reddit.com/r/ColbertRally/comments/dy1io/official_after_party_instructions/

In doing so we have won over the online heart of America. But the heart of Stephen Colbert is not so easily conquered. In order to convince Mr. Colbert to join hands in restoring Truthiness to Washington, we must first join wallets to restore Truthiness to the classroom!

We all know that our children are our number one resource, second only to oil, and in the same way that ocean water recently contaminated our precious oil in the Gulf of Mexico so has untruthiness infiltrated America's classrooms. All across this great land math, science and poverty corrupt our youth, depriving them of the opportunity that is every American’s God-given right! The right to make their decisions from right here, from the gut. But Nation, we can change all that.

ColbertRally.com, [100,000 Strong to Restore Truthiness](http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/group.php?gid=150942998258775), and reddit have teamed up with DonorsChoose.org, an online charity dedicated to highlighting the total failure of the *public* education system in America. This online charity’s worthiness is surpassed only by the strength of its Board of Directors, upon which sits the scion of our cause--one Mr. Stephen Colbert.

Contributions would work to buy computers, printers, classroom supplies, and even... books. Make no mistake, even if they go towards books, your donations deliver a clear message. We will no longer stand for public funds contaminating the minds of 7 year olds. We will no longer allow our hard earned tax money to push the liberal, fact-based agenda. And most importantly we will make crystal clear the demand that Stephen Colbert must take to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to address all of these grievances and more!

Let’s take back our youth, America. It’s simple, click the following link to go to [DonorsChoose.org](http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=39361) and give the world something to think about! Our goal is to collect $101,010 by Oct. 10, 2010 and since we love a competition we are going to keep tabs on how long it takes us to surpass Hillary Clinton’s total of $29,945.

1291239988.0	eeqg1	Found after the Rally: Memory card with pictures--I know it's a long shot, but I'd like to return the card to its owner.	ernkeebler	261	24	35	"The day after the Rally, I stumbled across a 2GB SD card in the grass near the Air and Space Museum. There wasn't anyone within a hundred feet (everyone was crowded over by the marathon). I went toward where people were and called out ""anyone lose a memory card?"" to no serious responses, so I held on to it. I know how important pictures can be to people as ways to remember family and experiences, and I'm sure whoever took these pictures would like this card back. I got back from the rally and forgot about the card for a couple days, and then I couldn't find it. Fast forward a month, I though I'd lost the card, but found it amongst some things in my desk--so here we are.
I don't know if the card was dropped at/after the Rally or the morning after, but given the card's location and position in the grass and how busy that weekend was for the Mall, it had to be within that span.
The pictures are of a family that seems to be on a road trip. I feel like I should reserve a couple details as ""Security Questions"" in case someone contacts me to claim it, but I'll be glad to post a few more pictures if it helps the card get back to the one behind the lens.
There were also a few videos taken, and I'll try to watch a couple of them to see if there are any relevant facts contained therein (but it might be a day or two before I've got a good moment to do so).

EDIT: thanks for the suggestions so far. I'll try them out once I have time + no work + internet.

They all went back to watch on the rally on TV/the internet.

If there were more screens/speakers, and if there were no alternatives for people to watch from home, this thing could have filled the entire mall. 

I just thought Reddit would like to know this.  I posted in DAE first, but dammit, I don't need other people to confirm.  This is true.

EDIT: From duhballs comment below, it sounds like there were crowds of people leaving during the rally along 7th, which is around where the screens/speakers ended.  Confirmatory evidence! 

EDIT2: From nilhilustfrederi comment below, the metro stations were packed as well.  I traveled at about 7:45am and could barely get on the train (we packed in Tokyo style), so I am sure this is correct.  It took nilhilustfrederi 3 hours to make a trip that would usually be 45 minutes, so I wonder how many people missed the rally due to this."	t5_2s3hr	True

Please-- if you ever donated to political cause in your life, this might actually be the one to donate to.   I know it sounds crazy, but how crazy was the rally-- and that was real.    

Please support Colbert's pac.   Think back to what a great job he did at the correspondents dinner, and imagine him able to do that in every living room in america, about their specific candidates or about specific issues.    

This isn't a joke anymore-- it hasn't been since the rally.   This is real.   This team of people is really going to try to fix things,  even if just a little.   If we can get them enough money, it really could change the world in positive ways that we can't even yet imagine.   

Please, help Colbert organize this with the same zeal as we did with the rallies.    This may not be quite as much fun, but it would be very real.    The right speech by the right speaker really can change an election-- and Colbert's truth can speak volumes.

i just to let you know that i am a practicing muslim woman, and as long as i have lived in this country (which is since i was 2, and i havent left once) i have never felt like i was really truly welcome here.  before 9/11, i always just felt like i was different.  people didnt really care about what i believed in, and i always felt a huge disconnect between myself and ""AMERICA.""  this feeling carried on well after 9/11, but as i got older i started to understand more about politics, dealt with racism first hand many times, tried to learn as much as i could in case i was ever in a situation where i had to debate and defend myself, my faith, &amp; my rights... which came in handy *plenty* of times.  this disconnect only grew with time.  i have lived my whole life in a country where i felt like i wasnt welcomed and didnt belong.  i have always wondered what it felt like to claim as nation as **MINE** but i just resigned myself to what i believed was my fate.

i dont think i have to explain what these past 2 years have felt like for me, with all the extra negative bullshit that islam has rigorously been getting thanks to pundits and politicians and fear-mongers alike.  the daily show and colbert report have been safehouses for me in this storm.  and this idea behind this rally seemed toooooo good to be true.

**but it wasnt.**

it was real.  everyone i saw there today actually exist.  that man holding the sign saying ""defeat foreign terrorists/support local mosques"" is a sane american, just like me. i watched person after person jumprope with muslims, because theyd rather do that than jump to conclusions. then i get on reddit and the front page as a picture of a muslim woman and her child holding a sign about being american, and 
i am floored by how warm the comments are.  i mean, it literally made my eyes well up.  i dont mean to sound like a sap, but this whole ""feeling like people recognize that the media has been completely out of line with the shit it says about islam &amp; muslims"" thing really means so much to me.  you may or may not know what its like to live in a country your whole entire life and feel like an alien, but it sucks it many ways, especially when you really care about what is going on in it.  today, i feel like i am 1 step closer to bridging that gap between me and the people in this country, and *nothing* could have done that for me except for the rally to restore sanity and/or fear.  i feel blessed to have been able to attend it, and loved all the reddit reminders i saw throughout the day.  thank you EVERYONE who participated, all over the world! my insignificant speck of humanity appreciates your patience and understanding, but especially sticking to you guns and being **real americans.**

tl;dr, i really needed this rally because i was so jaded from all the negative bullshit from the media &amp; i just wanted to thank everyone for being awesome and making me feel like a welcomed member or society here in the states."	t5_2s3hr	True

Yeah, I know it's not a word but it conveys my thought...and you know what I mean.

I understand the purpose of these rallies:  to give a voice to the moderates who want our leaders to sit down and read proposals, think about them, present them, debate them, and pass the best ones.  In short, moderates who want to restore truthiness.  I bet virtually everyone in this subreddit understands this as well as I do.

The problem is this:  If major media outlets and blogs, politicians, candidates, future candidates, and lobbyists don't understand the purpose of the rally, it can end up being bent to other purposes or have no purpose at all.

To expand:  we want politicians to cater to us, we want like-minded candidates to know that we will vote for them, we want the media to to have like-minded panelists appear.

Currently, politicians cater to the fringes because they are the most vocal, candidates are courted by fringe groups to run with the promise of money/support, the media puts on a R and a D and calls it balanced. 

TL;DR  Without a clear (to media/politicians) purpose, the rallies meanings will be distorted to something else, or have no demonstrable value at all"	t5_2s3hr	True

Working with Donors Choose and with the help of [this eagle-eyed redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/ColbertRally/comments/evx0q/congrats_guys_we_just_hit_600000/) we were able to track down the source of the change.  Two large donors had subsequently requested that their donations be redirected to their personal giving pages thus snatching away our total.

Think about it. How awesome would it be if CSPAN or some news media was covering the event. Then we all get together at the event and sing the SHIT out of The National Anthem.

I think it would stir the hearts of those in attendance and send a clear punch to the people who don't take us seriously that we really care.

Perhaps we can sing My Country, 'Tis of Thee too at the end of the event.

You are receiving this first regular update because you are one of the heroes with the balls to become a member of Colbert Super Pac. These are exciting times. Colbert Super PAC has been hailed in the national press as everything from ""legal"" to ""dangerous."" Your voice is being heard and I want to continue to hear from you! 

So here's the latest on what Colbert Super Pac is up to. Soon we'll release our first TV commercial, and send Washington a strong message: ""We can afford a commercial."" And that's just the beginning of the commercial. There will be twenty-six more seconds in it, chock-full of other messages. 

And let's face it: those messages are long overdue. America has forgotten who it is, where it's going, and how it got there. It's like America is the protagonist in one of those TV crime shows where a good cop loses his memories in an accident and has to piece them back together while solving a new murder every week. Luckily, America has help from a sexy love interest: Me. I should also mention that this show is on HBO, so you know there's gonna be boobs. 

But we have to act now, or this promising drama will go the way of my other great ideas for shows, from ""Wolf Attack: The Sitcom"" to ""Frasier 2."" Colbert Super PAC needs YOUR support to make America great again, and I think we both know I'm talking about the kind of support that is green and worth money, because it is money, or an emerald. Both are acceptable. 

So I urge you to drop everything and head to [www.ColbertSuperPAC.com](http://www.colbertsuperpac.com/). Then pick up the credit card you dropped when I told you to drop everything. 

[Donate now. Donate often. Make a difference. Make a donate.](https://colbertsuperpac.edonation.com/donation1/?initiativekey=REDDIT)

And together, we'll make a better tomorrow, tomorrow.

* Formation of a Tent City outside the Capital - **Tea Tattered Tent Towns** - we need people with a face out there saying they made these cities. The tea party is responsible for this. 
* Not blocking doors but being there, like a raven, staring at the politicians. We want them to see what they made and what they did. We want them to know people are watching them and what they did will not be forgotten. 
* We need no aggression just people in locked arms taking a play out of the tree huger movement playbook sitting in front of senate offices and lobbyist organizations like The American Chamber of Commerce, American Legislative Exchange Council, Heritage foundation, Citizens United, and the like.

The ""Sleeping Dragon""

Take large PVC pipe (1) and fix steel bolt (2) through center. Cover with chicken wire (3), slather with tar (4) and swirl with duct tape (5). Why? To gum up saws of police.

To use:
Locate a human being with arm (6), wrap and lock chain (7) around padded wrist, insert arm into pipe and attach carabiner (8) to steel bolt. Repeat on other side with another human arm. Continue process to create a ""Sleeping Dragon"" and block, thwart, surround object of demonstration.

While we are at the rally today, can we just keep in mind that there are people out there who feel utterly lost and hopeless? This man might die because in a city this big, with this many people, he didn't feel like he could talk to anyone. 

Can we all make up our minds that when we go home, not only have we made a difference in D.C. today, but we're also going to be the type of people that someone in  a desperate state-of-mind can talk to?

I don't know. Humor me on this please. My wife and kids were with me and we're having a hard time processing this. They are staying in today because my kids are petrified of the subway now. I'll see you all at the rally. Can't wait to meet as many of you as I can.

Edit: My brother and I went to the rally and had a really great time--except for the douchebag behind us who freaked out because no one was respecting his self-imposed picnic area in the middle of the rally. 

We were off to the right (if you're looking at the stage), next to the speakers and jumbotron. All in all we had a really great location. Here is where we were: http://imgur.com/XVLAb.jpg

Afterwards, we ate at Uno's at Union Station and then headed back to meet up with the family. They were in a lot better spirits (although very  bored) and we went out.

If any of you will still be in town tomorrow (we're not leaving until Monday), we're spending the day taking the double-decker bus tour.

Anyways, you can tell that certain themes and jokes are toned down when he is focusing on the troops.  This is because he does not want there to be any confusion, nor want anything to be taken in a way that diminishes his show of support.

Therefore, I am predicting that he will not announce the ""Restoring Truthiness"" rally (which I am also predicting will happen in March) until *after* his series of shows supporting the troops ends (while still wink-winking to all of us in the know that it's on like donkey kong).  That way, he doesn't take away any focus from the troops, and doesn't send any mixed messages to them.

A vote is a choice but when there is only one name to check, the only way I can have a choice is to write in an name to check off. Admittedly the incumbents, and all those running unopposed on the ballot undoubtedly win, but it's not like your ballot pays off like a lotto if you pick the tonight's winning numbers , (it is a secret ballot after all). So I used to stop to think about a random name to write in,(back in the day, I'd fill in Mickey Mouse, but fuck disney) but in the last few I've been just writing Stephen Colbert on those blanks. If he asked the ""Nation"" to do the same, he could get more votes than anyone ever, because we can vote for him for many/everything/s on the ballot. He could also ask his fan's to try to find out if there are real opposing candidates to fill in, but if not, get even vote Stephen T Colbert (the T's stand for truth(ieness)  It would send a statement.

The cost of an ad is $120, I was just going to pay for it up front but it would be great if some redditors could contribute a few dollars to lighten the load a bit.  Here's a pledgie link, the site accepts paypal and shows how much has been donated:  http://pledgie.com/campaigns/13711

""Hi ___

1309678322.0	ifiyt	How we can help shape ColbertSuperpac's mission and values	creedshandor	76	7	26	"After much discussion with lots of people, we now understand how Reddit can shape ColbertSuperpac. 

We set up / designate a fund of our own that redditors and allies can donate to.  This fund keeps track of the totals, but just passes the money on to Colbert's Superpac, like we did with DonorsChoose.   

However, we 'stage' calling those donations ""ours"", and then we use that 'fund' to kayfabe/faux ""bribe""  the ""Colbert character"" into supporting issues we actually really care about. 

(Net Neutrality?  Copyright?  Broken democracy?)   

All we need is a trusted party to implement such a ""fund"", ideally the same people who did an amazing job with the Rally and its fundraising.  

Our ""fund"" doesn't have to have a legal existence--  all donations probably should be just made straight to ColbertSuperpac from the individual donors-- the fine print isn't important. 

The important part isn't the legaleses, just the narrative and it's sheer awesomeness.  Here ""Geeks have formed a PAC to bribe normally-conservative Colbert into advancing their agenda""

We'll donate to that.    We're going to be donating to him anyway.

So if this rally suddenly had a specific political agenda to go along with it, I'd definitely be a touch disappointed.

Yet what we *do* have in common is that we find the radical, anti-intellectual right wing that's currently asserting itself ridiculous, frustrating, and potentially even dangerous.  We don't need to have some grander message attached to this rally, *that's* the power of satire!

1288927922.0	e1j1a	Greyhound overbooked, causing me to miss half the rally. Here's my letter to them.	Workaphobia	74	12	35	"**[Edit: I received a reply, quoted below.]**

I just sent this to them using their customer assistance link. I toned it down compared to what I was originally going to write. For instance, I did not conclude it ""Burn in hell"".


&gt; I'm writing to express my severe dissatisfaction with Greyhound's level of service on October 30th, 2010.

&gt;

&gt; Two days prior, I purchased a round-trip ticket from New York, NY to Washington, DC (reference number [omitted]). I was attending the ""Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear"", a 12:00pm to 3:00pm event that drew over two hundred thousand people to the capital. My bus was scheduled to depart at 6:30am and arrive 10:50am.

&gt;

&gt; As any reasonable person would expect, it was a bad day for travel. Ariana Huffington (of the Huffington Post) arranged for dozens if not hundreds of free buses to leave from Citi Field. Hotels were fully booked. The DC Metro was nearly unusable. And Greyhound's competitors were sold out.

&gt;

&gt; Yet I foolishly believed that I had a ride in. I thought that I had purchased a ticket that would get me to DC with time to spare, or that in the worst case I would be delayed until the next bus. I had not counted on Greyhound overbooking by a factor so large as to border on fraud.

&gt;

&gt; When I arrived, all of the automated ticketing machines were out of service. I can only speculate that they ran out of paper due to the sheer number of customers who had used them the day before. The employees at the counter were bewildered by the size of the queue, but managed to get me my ticket shortly before 6:30. I made my way to the lower level and asked which bording line was for DC, only to find that they were all one and the same.

&gt;

&gt; Then I waited. For over two hours.

&gt;

&gt; I knew there was no chance of arriving on time. As the line slowly snaked along the terminal walls, I ran into a friend who was more than an hour behind me; I'm pretty sure she gave up and went home.

&gt;

&gt; The lack of organization demonstrated by Greyhound was profound. Employees were not made aware of the impending rush beforehand, yet this should have been obvious from the number of people who would have ordered online like I did. Although additional drivers were eventually called in to board new buses, this did not do nearly enough to ease the congestion. Passangers were not instructed where to go: The three people ahead of me did not know until they reached the front that they had reserved seats.

&gt;

&gt; I eventually boarded around 8:40. We hit severe traffic on the Beltway, which would have been tolerable if it had happened sooner. About the only positive feature of the trip was that we were dropped off at Union Station instead of the alternative Greyhound station that was further away. I arrived when the rally was half over. (It is probably an exaggeration, but a part of me believes this event was my generation's Woodstock.)

&gt;

&gt; None of this is intended to denigrate my driver (who was extremely appologetic), or the employees at the terminal who were not expecting this onslaught. But Greyhound's policy of overbooking to such an extreme degree is unacceptable. When I buy a ticket that says that departure and arrival times are not guaranteed, or that boarding is on a first-come-first-serve basis, I expect a *good faith effort* that the company will attempt to satisfy the demand. I mistakingly believed that Greyhound was not sold out because they had the available capacity. It turns out that they were simply the only ones with the gall to so blatently deceive their customers.

&gt;

&gt; If I had any idea that this was the service I could expect for a basic ticket, I might have bought a reserved seat. However, the distinction between the three classes of tickets is not at all clear on Greyhound's website. Which is reserved? An ""Advanced Purchase""? A ""Standard Fare""? Then again, a company willing to charge me for the privilege of waiting on line hardly deserves my business, even when they can deliver.

&gt;

&gt; Worst of all, by giving the impression that I would be able to board reasonably close to 6:30, Greyhound dissauded me from seeking an alternate form of transportation, or from taking an even earlier bus.

&gt;

&gt; I will not be riding Greyhound again. I will advise my friends against riding Greyhound. I'll probably post this online for others to see. I don't think a refund will change any of that -- $15 (for one-way) is hardly worth the effort, as I think I've made it clear that the damage to me was far greater. I accept that I bear responsibility for believing that this bus ride would be just like oh so many trips on Amtrak, and that I could have avoided the trouble by traveling the day before. But Greyhound made it clear on Saturday that their service could not be trusted as reliable or honest.

&gt;

&gt; [Name omitted]

&gt;

&gt; P.S. Is it really that difficult or expensive to put a sink in a bus bathroom? Honest question.

**Edit: I received the following reply on November 25th.**

&gt; Reference: 1683311

&gt; Dear Mr. [Name omitted],

&gt; Thank you for expressing your concerns regarding the inconvenience you experienced while using our services.  We are never satisfied when a customer expresses a complaint or displeasure over the way he or she is treated or served, and we regret you had an unpleasant experience.

&gt; At Greyhound Lines, Inc., we strive to achieve a high standard of customer satisfaction and rely on customers like you to make us aware of areas that need our attention.

&gt; Greyhound does not have a reservation system, however, we make every effort to provide seating for each passenger.  We operate a capacity-flexible system; that is, we add extra buses and drivers to a schedule when they are needed and if they are available.  Unfortunately, we are unable to determine the exact number of passengers on each schedule, and as a result, overloads do sometimes occur.

&gt; We hope you will not let this incident deter you from using our services, and we trust you will give us another opportunity to prove that we can be the most reliable and economical form of transportation to meet your needs.

&gt; Sincerely,

&gt; Ms. Quintero

I spent the whole weekend making a Colber-Costume, taking pictures of me wearing it and editing them. This is what I came up with:

Yes, it's unfair to judge an entire group from the actions of a few.

I know there will be fun, ridiculous signs, signs of sarcasm and wit - but signs with the N-word, signs referring to Tea Party people as retards, signs that are just expressions of stupid anger should be shamed and rejected.

Last thing we need is for every media outlet and FOX to display ""Oh, look - the Beck rally didn't have any crazy signs (ignoring that they weren't allowed to have any) but look at these Stewart/Colbert horrible people!""

I'm sure this request will be ""OMG YOU'RE VIOLATING MY FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO BE A DICK."" No - I'm just asking that if someone is a dick, they can go hang out in the Dick Zone off to the side and let people know ""I'm not with that dick."""	t5_2s3hr	True

Please post here if you'd love to go, and think if you had some extra support you could probably make the trip.  Uncertain exactly how to do this, but I had the idea last night and my spirit totems told me it was the Right Thing To do.

**Update!**
Our daughter was born this morning, Sept 18, the year of Colbert.  She already shows promise in the arena of casting a looming shadow of fear and oppression on the populace!!  Truly a miracle.  On to business.

Since I doubt the effectiveness of handing $5 to everyone who posts here needing help attend, my ~$200 allotment will go to a few hand-selected, totally arbitrary beneficiaries.  However, because Reddit is SO amazing, Comrade MarvStage has offered his own support/sponsorship.  In time other philanthropic redditors will surely surface to account for all the marvelous rabble !

Jon Stewart's speech condemned the polarizing bullshit from both sides, not just the conservatives.  He showed how to move forward, we really have to put that nonsense behind us.  I've seen this kind of content propagated on reddit quite often, and I must admit I myself have said the same things.  But it has to stop.  We all have to be better than this.

I'm a college student and for one of my classes I need to create a documentary. I think Reddit is incredibly powerful and can change people's lives. I want to capture that.

First of all, I need to figure out if this can happen. If this just gets buried in all of the posts, I don't have a lot of hope that I can pull this off. I'll need this to be well-known, and hopefully I can create a sub-reddit about it, so I can stay in touch with everyone involved.

Second, I would need people to agree to sitting down with me for interviews. Sadly, there's only so many Redditors I can interview, and I would love to get some of the Reddit ""celebrities"". Not just famous users like NonSensicalAnalogy (love that guy), but especially the people who have had Reddit impact their live in a major way (P-Dub). I would love to get the stories of how and why this happened and let people know the power of an internet community. The idea that a bunch of completely anonymous users can band together and form something this amazing needs to have its story told. I want to be that person.

Does anyone have any ideas about cool things we could do to show our appreciation to Stephen and the staff and crew over at TCR for 1000 great shows?

TheLateThagSimmons	55	5	6	"I left the teacher with this note: ""I want promote knowledge of the scientific method so that children will be better equipped to make this world a better place than the world they inherited. Please do this for me.""

I got this in response once the project was completed:

*Dear [TheLateThagSimmons],* 

*Thank you for your donation to my project, Think Like A Scientist. My classroom is full of eager, active learners. When I told them that we would get labcoats for our science work, they cheered! I am not sure they all know what a labcoat is but they could tell by my excitement that something good is coming their way.
When my students put on their new labcoats for science experiments, I know they will take their work very seriously. I plan to remind them of the steps scientists go through to test their ideas. My hope is that all my students will love science and continue to want to learn about the world around them. 
My students will share the labcoats with the other first grade students in our school and any other classes that want to use them. Your donation may inspire an entire school of young scientists.
With gratitude,
Ms. A.*

I have had a huge grin on my face all day ever since receiving this message. The thought of a whole class of little kids on the other side of the country of whom I never met, nor in any likelihood will ever meet, *cheering* with their little voices at the thought of obtaining lab coats, of which they most likely have no idea what they are, won't get out of my head.

L093fkd	54	7	45	"So, we successfully donated over $200,000 to help fund classrooms and get Colbert's attention so we could have a rally in DC. We got our rally, which is great, but now people not from around Maryland need to find ways to travel here and places to stay. Is it possible for Reddit to set up a donation fund and do a fund-drive so we can generate money to help people who want to come, but are having trouble affording it, get here? As long as we can verify the authenticity of where the money is going, I think people would be extremely willing to help out--particularly those folks who simply cannot attend due to other obligations, or they already live in the area and will have minimal travel expenses. I for one would have no problem with donating money to a trustworthy fund if I knew it was going to help people get here and make the rally a huge success. 

I just googled renting charter buses, and it looks like the average price per day is a little over $1000 for the big 50-seaters, depending on how many miles you’re going. I think we need to find people who are willing to coordinate renting charter buses for different cities along the east coast and central states. I know that based on the amazing people we have on this site, there are folks here with experience doing this kind of thing who would be anxious to help with this aspect.  

I’m just concerned because I’m looking at a lot of comments on Reddit and the Facebook pages for these rallies where people are saying they’d love to come but can’t afford it. As we all know, both Stewart and Colbert are taking a huge risk doing this. They’re going to be putting a boatload of time and energy and money, not to mention credibility, into organizing a rally because they were convinced we were serious about this. If we can manage to raise over $200,000 simply to get their attention (and also to support a good cause), I see no reason why we couldn’t raise at least that much again to help our fellow Redditors get to the rally so we can support its message, and also support Stewart and Colbert—also a good cause. And to all those who are worried this is just a joke rally without a message, while that may be how Colbert ramps up interest on his end, I think Stewart has made it clear he wants to send a serious signal with this. 

This is our time to really stand up and make this happen, and make it something worth remembering. I want to look back on this in years and feel pride about what we accomplished— and not disappointment because we only got a couple thousand people to show up. 



EDIT: The idea was brought up below that even if Reddit ends up not doing a donation fund, people who need transportation but can't pay the amount of money needed could come together and pool their money into renting a charter bus, which reduces the cost for everyone. For instance, the day-rate for a 50-seat charter bus is around $1200, which works out to around $25 per person--much more manageable for folks. Although I would love to see a Reddit-wide donation fund happen, I think this is a great idea. One advantage is you can have ""point-people"" from certain cities already start figuring out how many people are interested/willing to commit, and begin organizing buses from that city now. A method to ascertain how committed people actually are would need to be developed; you couldn't have a point-person rent a 55-seat bus because they got 55 people saying they were interested, and then early Saturday morning only 20 people show up (driving up the cost for everyone unexpectedly). But I'm sure you all will come up with a solution! And if/when the donation fund does take place, it would just be icing on the cake for everyone! "	t5_2s3hr	True

**""The King will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.'**

""Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.

1285994399.0	dlspy	A Response to “Why are the Satellite Rallies so Expensive?”	aussie_angeleno	47	1	16	"Some Redditors are unhappy with the efforts to raise funds to hold satellite rallies in Chicago and Los Angeles. As one of the LA satellite rally organizers, I would like to respond.


I will be the first to say I wish it was free. After all, no one is getting paid to organize this. We are all volunteering our time and energy towards something we believe in. I wish I didn’t have to raise funds. But having started this and having committed to this, I feel responsible for creating a safe and quality event that everyone can enjoy. 


This is how it happened. I originally thought we could simply put the word out to gather at the Westwood Federal Building and that would be it. My friends and I had been discussing how much we wanted to attend the DC event, but it was just too expensive. When someone on Reddit suggested we start satellite rallies, I made a FaceBook group which quickly transitioned into a FaceBook page. I thought it would be fun to have our own mini-rally to show our support of the larger one in DC. 


Hundreds of people started joining the FB page via word of mouth. In less than two weeks, we have accumulated over 1,600 members and we haven’t even sent out a press release yet. So, as support for the rally grew and as people became excited about the event, it became evident we would need to get a permit for a public gathering. I’ve organized a lot of events before, but never a rally. I soon discovered that the Federal Building has a lot of requirements in order to secure a permit. I was told that if more than 100 people were to gather we would need to rent porta-potties. The application asked us to consider security and medics. I realized we needed a stage, sound, fencing, a generator. So we started building out a budget. Someone suggested we get event insurance. This is how we came to the estimate of $10,000. A big, scary number. We started fund raising and people started donating. $10 here and $20 there. But it has added up to over $1,700 to date. People are getting behind this. Frankly, I am amazed. 


And in amongst all that, a community started growing. It’s something beautiful. In the last couple of days all the satellite rally organizers in twenty or so cities across the US came together and created a mailing list. It feels like a national movement is forming. Austin has over 2,300 RSVPs via word of mouth. Seattle has over 3,500 members on their FaceBook page. Chicago has over 3,600 members. Something about the Stewart/Colbert rallies has captured the public imagination. 


The satellite rally organizers are now talking about forming non-profit organizations to deal with all the donations. We are doing it to avoid personal liability. But, think about it. A network of “restore sanity” non-profits are about to spring up in America. I don’t know what it means. I don’t know if this will continue after October 30 or not. But, Reddit, together with Stewart and Colbert, you have started something big. 


PS: By the way, from the very beginning, Los Angeles has been committed to donating any additional funds raised to the colbertrally donorschoose.org campaign to “restore truthiness to the classroom”.
 

TL;DR: It is expensive to responsibly create a good quality, legal and safe public gathering for the people and by the people.

1288402511.0	dyj49	Rally attendees, including the satellite gatherings, a few well intended suggestions from Mom.  (Just humor me, okay?)	GenJonesMom	63	21	27	"I am more than aware that this rally is not supposed to be seen as political.  However, like it or not, the reality is that this rally is perceived by the rest of the country (and world) and all media, to be a political statement against far-right extremism.  Yes, they say it's against far-left extremism as well (so we don't come off as partisan), but has there really been that much extremism on the progressive side?  No.

Also, I will bet my last dollar that a big theme of the rally is going to be getting the vote out on Tuesday.  No matter how you look at it, that is politics.  Besides, the rally is taking place on the Saturday before the election, and that in itself makes it political.

That all said, I think it is important to at least have a cursory knowledge of what is going on politically in our country right now before you attend either the main rally, or the satellite ones.  We've all seen the New Left Media interviews at the Tea Party and Glenn Beck rallies, where the attendees didn't know anything when asked what they were for or against.  Many of them actually stated that they didn't know the specifics, but just knew for a fact that the healthcare bill and the Obama Administration were evil because Glenn Beck and Fox News told them so.

Show the world we are better than that because damnit, we are.  There will be plenty of media present on Saturday (at the satellite rallies as well), and it is almost a certainty that they will be interviewing participants.  You can count on it.

So here is Mom's advice:

1. If you are voting republican, democrat, libertarian, green or ""the rent is too damn high"", know why.  Don't just say it's because you don't like the other party.  Know exactly what you like about the party you are voting for, and what you don't like about the party you are voting against.  If you are not going to vote, be prepared to say why that is.

2.  Know who the US Congressional and gubernatorial candidates are in your state.  You can go to your state's election website or look on your ballot to find out.  Be able to intelligently say why you are for them or against them.  It doesn't take that much time to check them out online.

3. If there are some major initiatives (amendments or propositions) on the ballot in your state (my state of CA has several important ones), know what they are, how you plan on voting and why.

4. For extra credit it would be a good idea to educate yourself on what bills were passed by the House and Senate in the last 2 years and which ones failed.  Also, which ones were supported by the Democrats (pretty much all), and which ones were opposed by the Republicans (pretty much all).  It would also be useful to know what Obama has accomplished during his term so far, and what the Republican Party has accomplished as well.

Maybe you really couldn't give a rat's ass about politics, or always make it a habit of not talking about politics and how you vote.  That's fine.  However, you may be asked why you are at the rally and what you hope the rally accomplishes.  Be able to articulately and coherently give an answer to these questions.

Even if you don't agree with the need to know any of the things I have suggested or aren't interviewed, you will be a more informed and better educated voter come Tuesday.  In other words, no harm done.

If you think that this post of mine was inappropriate for this subreddit, fine.  It's just something that I felt I had to do.

**TL;DR:** Educate yourself a little about US politics before you attend the rallies.  Even if you don't think the rallies will be political, the rest of the world does.

One last thing and Mom will shut up.  I am so proud of my Reddit community that my heart feels like it could burst.  The world is a better place because you are in it.

Oh, and before I forget, Redditors tend to be pale, so please wear sunscreen.

**Edit:** It looks like some of you need some Cliff Notes. 

**The US Congress:**

The **Senate** is made up of **100 members**, 2 elected every 6 years from each state.

Vice President Joe Biden is the President of the Senate (he can cast a tie-breaking vote).

The Senate **Majority Leader** is Democrat, **Harry Reid**, from Nevada (currently behind in the polls against Tea Party supported Sharon Angle running on the Republican ticket).  The majority leader is always from the party that holds the majority in the Senate.

The Assistant Majority Leader or **Democratic Whip** is **Dick Durbin**, from Illinois (if Reid loses he will take his place -edit: maybe).

The Senate **Minority Leader** is Republican, **Mitch McConnell**, from Kentucky.

The Assistant Minority Leader or **Republican Whip** is Republican, **Jon Kyl**, from Arizona.

**The US House of Representatives**

The **House** is made up of **435 members** elected every 2 years.  The seats in the House are apportioned among the states by population.  The more populated your state is, the more seats your state will have.

The **Speaker of the House** is Democrat, **Nancy Pelosi**, from California.  The Speaker is chosen from the party in majority in the House.

The House of Representatives **Majority Leader** is Democrat, **Steny Hoyer**, from Maryland.

The House **Majority Whip** is Democrat, **Jim Clyburn**, from South Carolina. 

The House of Representative **Minority Leader** is Republican, **John Boehner**, from Ohio.

The House **Minority Whip** is Republican, **Eric Cantor**, from Virginia.

I hope this is helpful.

This rally has me so hyped up, more so than the secret santa! And that was exhilarating in the creepiest stalker way possible! It's political jazz hands to the max, and I wanna celebrate with my own reddit trophy. I have only one, perhaps poor, idea to verify that a user actually made it and it is this:
You submit a photo of you at the rally, then you email with your reddit username to someone who compiles a list to be submitted to the proper trophy making authorities. I will volunteer to sift through the pictures, because I wish to see the trophy happen, and I  don't mind looking at pictures of all you sexy beasts. Or perhaps we can automate it somehow using google latitude or foursquare or any of those other location based social networks. Perhaps make a public post to one of those with your username in brackets or something like that. Then a brilliant coder out there can scrape those to compile a list.

I realize this is probably going to sound negative, and I really don't mean it to be, but for the people who weren't there, know that it wasn't all wine and roses.
  
I did not actually enjoy being there. A lot of this was admittedly due to poor planning. We got up at 4:30am, did flight/car/Metro all on the morning of the rally, and finally arrived at about 11-11:30ish. At that point, the main area was already shoulder to shoulder. There was plenty of room back across 7th, so we decided to set up there. We realized we wouldn't be able to see anything, but figured we'd be able to hear and would have a little space to breathe.  

Then the rally started. We realized quickly we weren't going to be able to hear anything, either. At the same time, the street filled up, and we spent the rest of the day defending my grandparents and another elderly couple from the crowd, including many, many people who inexplicably thought that trying to plow over/through seated old people was a great idea. 

(There was a group of Redditors next to me who were helping out. We joked a bit, but we didn't really talk. Sorry guys, you seemed nice, but I was not up for socializing.)

The metro on the way back was pretty much the same as the rally. Wall to wall people, pushing, shoving, etc. Understandable, but very unpleasant.

I am one of the many DC-Area redditors (live in Arlington across the river).  I thought it might be helpful to have a thread posting general helpful information for all of our fellow redditors coming to visit us on the 30th.  

To start off, here are some helpful links for information:

http://www.wmata.com/ - DC Metro Information

www.nps.gov/applications/parks/nacc/ppMaps/map_final2.pdf - NPS National Mall Map (PDF)

http://washington.org/ - Tourism and travel info, deals on transportation, etc.

https://www.smartbikedc.com/program_information.asp - DC Smart Bike Program (rent bicycles, ride them, drop them off elsewhere).

Some general info:

1) On metro escalators, walk on the left, stand on the right.  A number one pet peeve for residents is people blocking the escalators.

2) Cool bars/restaurants, etc can be found all over the city, but some good places to start are the U-Street area (green/yellow lines), dupont circle (red line), eastern market (behind capitol, blue and orange lines), and gallery place/chinatown (red, yellow, and green lines).  I also like hanging out in the courthouse clarendon area since it is close to me (orange line, in VA).  Georgetown is nice, but I find it can get a bit douche-y in the later evenings.

Now's your chance, DC-redditors! Post some of your favorite haunts and things to do so we can show our guests a great time!  Non-DCers, post your questions!

1284752884.0	dfcqz	Let's not bash the tea party, support drugs, or go meme crazy	ferrarisnowday	57	19	39	"A lot of the ideas I'm seeing here make me a little worried about how this rally will go down in the eyes of the public.  If we show up as a crowd of people holding signs supporting drug legalization, pedobear (the scariest bear of them all!), or bashing the tea party; the media will just focus in on those subjects.  I'm imagining headlines like:

&gt;""Colbert Rally full of internet inside jokes"" (like the media knows what a ""meme"" is)

&gt;""Stewart, Colbert hold rally for drug legalization and gay marriage""

And of course many, many, too stupid to even imagine in advance, fox news headlines about us bashing the tea party movement.

Now, listen, I'm not saying there is anything wrong with movements for stuff like drug legalization and gay marriage -- it's just not what these rallies are about, and we don't want to confuse the media.

Our message is simply that political discourse needs to become less sensational and more civil.  Signs *bashing* the tea party are not civilized.  Sure, the tea party movement *can* be *critiqued* in a civil manner; but so many ideas I have seen posted on reddit are not as civil as we should be striving for.  I'm not even sure it is a good idea to specifically reference the tea party -- we want to get people thinking about their actions, not put them on the defensive.

In short, this has the potential to be a huge event in American politics...but it also has the potential to just be a bunch of comedy central fans and redditors hanging around having a good time.  I won't regret going either way, but I'd much rather have an effect on American politics than just have a good time.

When I went to bed last night (as I'm a European, caught up in the awesomeness of Colbert) a project I had funded was 2h and 400+ dollars away from being funded. I thought it might not happen due to things slowing down, and I wondered what happened to projects that expired without having its goals met.

When I woke up this morning, the first thing I did was to check... and it was funded! Not by people giving to the most urgent project, but by people going in there and donating to said project. I don't know the teacher, I don't know the kids.. hey, they're not even on my continent!

In my country, teachers don't need to pay for stuff like this, as it's provided by the state. Seeing these teachers, really caring for their students, trying everything after they're given what they can themselves... I stayed up for hours reading thank you-letters pouring in and seeing the sum of money go up and up and up.

In short, don't give because it's Colbert, give because it's right. I'm not in your country or on your continent, but I'm gonna set up a monthly transfer so my euromoney will become school supplies in the US.

It is, perhaps, irrational to place hope in such vulgar acts. But, we must not forget that if there is any truth in democracy, it is a vulgar truth. When faced with an apogee of madness that is generated and sustained by the bulk of mass media, perhaps satire is the only intellectually honest response.

1284940123.0	dg468	10/30/10 Shouldn't Be the End of Restoring Truthiness	rasinbrahms	43	5	9	"This is my sincerest plea. I share this with you because I don't believe anyone else will hear.

Restoring Truthiness can't end on 10/30/10, and I can't and won't believe that a movement causing donations surpassing $250,000 is ""for the lulz.""

So much of what is happening now is related to experiences we all shared, namely that being 9/11, the Bush presidency, the Great Recession, the take over of radicalism, the birth of fear, and a historical presidential campaign based on hope and change where more youth participated than any previous election.

We want Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert to rally because we're tired of the misinformation from news organizations (namely Fox News). We're upset about radicalism taking over politics and slowly dismantling our nation's ability to take care of itself (how Republicans are voting ""no"" to everything, making sure all appointments made by Obama are slowed at any cost, and how Democrats are virtually unable to reach across the aisle).

We're so upset that we band together to raise over $250,000 for classrooms across the nation. We're so disgusted by Glen Beck's disrespect of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and radically charged rhetoric that we strongly petition Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert to rally in D.C.

But that shouldn't be the end of it. It **can't** be the end of it. 9/12 wasn't the end of the Tea Party rally. Why should 10/30?

What if we used this momentum for more positives? What if we continued to donate to DonorsChoose.org with monthly goals? Why stop there? What if we continued the ""March to Keep Fear Alive"" on Halloween, dress as Tea Party extremists with signs like ""Take it down a notch for America,"" went door to door asking people to register to vote and use sanity? What if we started our planning now to prevent a hateful and fearful ""Koran Burning Day"" or something similar on the 10th Anniversary of 9/11?

Of course those may be terrible ideas, but honestly, I believe we need to do something to battle this radical idealism that's taking over our nation.

We can't let Restoring Truthiness end on 10/30/10. We can't keep the reputation of being ""the lazy youth"" that the generations prior were. We need to solve these problems now and not inherit them in the future when we're ""old enough to care."" 

It may be too late for this election, but if the past three elections are any indication, 2012 will be even more emotional, dramatic, and charged with misinformation and radicalism.

Please. Let's be the change we can believe in. Can we start brainstorming on how to keep this ball rolling? Can we keep Truthiness alive past 10/30?

2. Any action in response by either NBA or NBPA can result in court action, where they would have to prove Cuban's culpability. Remember that Cuban is protected by Colbert Super PAC S.H.H., which doesn't have to disclose anything. 

3. If the suing party wins, Cuban pays a fine, but, it can be a precedent setting case regarding 501(c)(4) corporations. If they lose, it just further highlights the obvious problem and serves comedic purpose for Colbert.

Why Potter and Colbert would do this: it's obvious that they intend to go as far with this as possible to test the system, as they've done by getting the SuperPAC and the shell corp. If they succeed in getting further, it shows the ridiculousness of the system; if they fail in getting further (which hasn't happened yet), it can be a blow to the ridiculous system.

Why Cuban would do this: he's seems to have sensible political views. He's doesn't avoid controversy, nor does he mind paying fines to the NBA.

That said, the ad is weaksauce. It should be better executed and it should be more provocative in order to force the NBA and NBPA to take action.

He's always maintained that the rally was planned ahead of time and that the Internet campaign ""didn't hurt"" the rally but didn't really change anything. I've believed this to be true and reddit happened to support a rally that was already going to occur, but preempted the official announcement by chance.

And now... BAM!! Two months later there it is! Some evidence to the contrary. Stewart said his staff had to throw the whole thing together in six weeks. Reddit... I think it really is safe to say that we made that rally happen.

How amazing would it be if there was not only a rally being held in DC, but also smaller rallies being held across the country?

An event for the people who don't believe that ""Obama is Hitler"" or ""Bush is Hitler."" He says ""the loud folks"" (the minority) have been dominating our national conversation and it's time to hear from the ""70-80 percenters!""

*Update:* ""Tonight I announce the Rally to Restore Sanity (10/30/10). I""t is happening people, IT IS HAPPENING!"" ""We will gather on the National Mall on Washington, D.C."" The message: A ""call for rationality!"" Signifiance of October 30: The Daily Show was already going to be there anyway.

""Spreading the timeless message: *take it down a notch for America!*""

*Update:* Guest is President Bill Clinton. Will update if anything to do with the rallies is said.

But let's be surprised later on anyway, OK?

*Update:* Jon Stewart ends by pleading to ignore Colbert's impending ""meaningless"" announcement, and another awesome movie montage.

**Colbert's Turn!**

*Update:* Stephen Colbert breaks into his rant against Stephen Hawking to make ""A Big Announcement.""

*Update:* Calls Jon's announcement ""disturbing,"" quoting the ""million moderate march,"" ""pretty reasonable request,"" and ""take it down a notch for America."" Stephen Colbert ""will not take it down a notch!"" ""Reason is just one letter away from treason!""

*Update:* ""America cannot afford a rally to restore sanity."" Queue montage of fear-mongering from the media. ""To restore Truthiness, I am announcing my rally. Nation, are you ready?""

*Update:* Colbert puts his head on the Lincoln Memorial with greenscreen, announces on October 30, 2010, ""The March to Keep Fear Alive!"" ""Government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the Earth! (But you might!)"" (Awful special effects.)

*Update:* Stewart has just interrupted Colbert's show now! They exchange fictitiously heated words. Colbert: ""People should book their hotel rooms now or their children will turn gay!"" Stewart: ""No, people should book their hotel rooms now or it might be more difficult later to get a reasonable rate!""

[I would have liked to write something up earlier, but a weekend in NYC can be hectic. still exhausted today.]

Some were there for the music, but I was there to just see Colbert make an appearance, not knowing that he was taping a whole week's worth of shows and staying for the whole show. So many moments stand out, including his hilarious endorsement of Pepsi at one point, the one that may not make it on the show (I missed last night's episode, so who knows).... Stephen took a swig of Pepsi, then announced a new Pepsi slogan to the crowd: ""Pepsi....Put It In Your Mouth"" , and later did another Pepsi promo with ""Pepsi...the official drink of my throat."" As I told my host in Manhatten the next day...when you sign up to sponsor Colbert with your product, you take a gamble (a damn good one). 

the music (!!!) :
Santigold was soulful, and her lyrics (""while we sleep in America/Our house is burning down"") were as haunting as the melodies that Grizzly Bear crafted. And everyone in the crowd has heard ""Do you Realize?"" by Flaming Lips, but the performance was so evocative and fresh, one couldn't help but ponder the lyrics like it was the first time ever hearing it. On the other side of comedic genius is the ability to stare into the dark abyss of life, embrace the duality of it all, and that's why Colbert Report is so closely linked to good music. Colbchella was punch-in-the-face satire juxtaposed with heart-rending soul.  

It was really cool to see Colbert at one point get into the middle of the crowd and do a segment surrounded by the audience. I was watching the video feedback on the big screen of what they were taping, and noticed how in some shots there were guys in the frame with Colbert who looked a bit bedraggled from 4 hours of standing up, yet they lit up with big grins as soon as they announced shooting resumed. You could tell how genuinely happy audience members were just to be there, and be with Colbert....these weren't bored tourists sitting in on a Jimmy Fallon taping and being instructed to clap or smile, but a crowd of kids who would have sailed off on the Intrepid with Colbert and conquered Staten Island if he asked us to. While looking for pictures, I saw a great Colbert-ism from Colbchella on the Village Voice blog that I had almost forgotten about--

------
""The cockfighting is BYO cock."" Colbert pronouncing the Hudson River as international waters,and telling the audience to expect a night full of ""gambling, orgies, and cockfighting.""
------


Colbert was by far the best concert host I've ever seen....yeah, some warmup hype-man/comedian-guy was out yelling at people to make noise, etc during the run-up to the music, but the whole time Colbert was on stage, it was magic. I've seen my share of big-name comedians perform on stage, but have never seen someone as comfortable and quick-on-his-feet. I don't know what would faze Colbert. Whenever the show director announced that shot would have to be re-taped, Colbert would do it again with even more hilarious ad-libs than the time before. For example, when his sincere and funny intro for Grizzly Bear didn't get taped right, he did it again but better. It would be amazing to have film of the entire night just to appreciate all the bloopers, ad-libs, etc. For me, the fact that night was a taping made it MORE fun, it was like being at a music festival and a Colbert gig at the same time. A sweet, warm, delicious combo. 

I got to the line at the Intrepid just before 6pm, not as early as I had hoped, but early enough to get a free cup of Colbert's Americone from the Ben &amp; Jerry's guys posted at the entrance. In line, a fellow Colbert junkie and myself commiserated on the genius of Colbert. While Jon Stewart may poke fun at current events, Colbert actually makes himself PART of them, yet rarely issues statements or overt judgements on events, just merely asking questions that expose logical fallacies (..like Socrates, you could say justly). We agreed that Colbert's testimony before Congress was the premier highlight of his comic genius, both in terms of crossing over into the ""real world"" in his character, and also his sharp intellect and wit in giving actual testimony, not just a couple of punchlines. 


I'm no Hunter S Thompson, so unsure the best way to describe the whole night. I googled just now to figure out what two  songs Grizzly Bear played, and a few reviews of Colbchella came up- positive reviews, but all of them mentioning how a couple performers had to do songs twice for the taping due to technical errors. 

It's true, but that was one of the best parts of the show actually. Grizzly Bear and Santigold were scintillating...so much so, in fact, that when they both had to repeat one of their respective songs, the crowd just got louder and more hyped. For those of us who've seen reggae music live, seeing a song more than once in a concert is not only common, but popular with crowds. 

Some of us in line pondered the complimentary drink tickets described in our audience letters, and were happy to find free beer, bags of chips, and bottled water were plentiful. Colbert really was a damn good host of the Intrepid, and I'd follow the guy into battle anytime....especially after seeing his tassle shimmy in the Admiral's uniform. 

All of the music was really great, and Flaming Lips seemd to be extra amped up for their two song set...possibly because they are a friend of the show. 

and yes, I did touch Colbert's bubble when it came to the middle of the crowd. Kind of hard to believe now, but it was pretty believable at the time to my THC-infused brain.

He states that not all Republicans would be on board with the narrative of Fox news. He then states that Fox news would choose a Democrat if s/he holds the view that's in line with the argument made by Fox news. 

In other words, he's making a distinction between the positions taken by ""Republicans"" and ""Fox news,"" which, although they overlap often, are not identical. He's making a nuanced argument.

1286565731.0	dop1r	DC METRO : Let's list everything first timers should know to make everything go as smooth as possible.	epicgeek	30	6	22	"**How Things Work :**

* You're charged based on distance between stations.
* The card machines list how much it costs from your current location to any other location.
* You can put X amount on your card or buy a day pass (day passes work all day on weekends, but only start working at 9:30am on weekdays).
* Your paper card goes in the front of the machine, pops out the top and the gate opens as soon as you pull your card out (you are charged when exiting).
* If you enter, but don't have enough money on your card to exit there are machines on the inside that let you add money to your card.
* Parking lots have a flat cost of about $4.50. It's not based on time.
* You need a Smart Trip card to exit at most parking garages, but there's usually one exit that accepts credit card. (Smart Trips are sold at little machines next to the regular card machines at the parking lot stops).
* A Smart Trip card costs you about $20, starts with about $10 on it and can go negative (you have $1, get charged $4 to exit and your card now has -$3... you can't enter with a negative value).
* You can add money to a Smart Trip card at all the card machines.
* Smart Trip cards work similar to the paper cards except there's a scanner with an image of a card on it. It's pretty obvious.

**Social Faux Pas :**

* Stand on the right side of the escalator, walk on the left.
* Do not stop when you reach the end of the escalator.
* If you have a baby carriage use the elevator. Virtually all stops have them, they're just not obvious at first.
* When you're boarding a train move to the center quickly, don't block the doors.
* No eating or drinking on the trains or at the stations.

**Big Mistakes :**

* Do NOT hold train doors open. Trying to hold them open or pry them open can screw up the sensor and they'll **OFFLOAD THE ENTIRE TRAIN** because they can't tell if the door is open or not."	t5_2s3hr	True

Arrowmatic	25	2	7	"From: [http://www.nofactzone.net/2011/01/07/episode-7004-162010-ronald-depinho/](http://www.nofactzone.net/2011/01/07/episode-7004-162010-ronald-depinho/)

Allow me to explain the Arby’s plug, and then betray Stephen’s trust. Sorry Stephen.

So in the pre-show Q&amp;A, an audience member asked Stephen if he remembered a joke from last month. I personally don’t remember, but apparently it was a segment about unhealthy food or something, and Stephen suggested that instead of execution, people on death row just be given Arby’s? I’m not sure, perhaps someone else can recall.

So the audience member asks if Stephen considered a segment where he actually did that: visited prisoners on death row and actually gave them Arby’s. Your quizzical reaction to that suggestion was mirrored by Stephen and the rest of the audience. After Stephen light-heartedly pushed for an answer, the audience member admitted that he worked for a public relations company that was attempting to rebrand Arby’s in the public eye. Stephen more or less pointed out the flaw in the suggestion the same way he did at the top of the show.

During that answer, Stephen also told us about how Comedy Central, in what Stephen insisted was a rare incident, had actually asked them to cut a joke from the night’s show; in what turned out to be the Cheating Death segment, he was going to make reference to the real side effects of a medication (for the de-aging rats, maybe?), which included runny stool. This would be followed by ""runny stool… why do I suddenly crave Arby’s?” Stephen said the general rule is that if a sponsor’s already in the news, it’s fair game, but Comedy Central asks for side jokes about sponsors to be removed (though Stephen kind of turned it into a one-minute one-man play by acting out how CC doesn’t directly ask for its removal, but instead keeps asking ""is it reeeeeeallly important to you? Do you neeeeeeeed this joke?”). The show was running long anyway (thus no Table of Contents before the theme song) so they didn’t care about cutting it.

Also, there were two magnificent character breaks that Stephen told us ""no one outside this room will ever have to know about, unless you blog.” He had to restart from the last video clip each time. The first was when he broke down laughing before he could get out that we should tell old sick people to ""walk it off.” He also screwed up a word shortly after the lynx came out, but I could overhear/read his lips once the segment ended, and he got Paul Dinello to confirm that they’d just splice out the audio underneath a shot of the lynx. I watched the episode, and it’s so seamless, I assume that’s what they did. The second break/restart was during the Bill O’Reilly/tides segment, when he responded to a clip where Silverman sarcastically references Thor while arguing against O’Reilly. That clip/response was cut entirely from the episode (again, seamless – I can’t even remember where exactly it was in the segment). I can’t recall what the joke was; I think Stephen threw out the scripted joke when he did it the second time, and just improvised an immature insult.

After the sign-off, he said goodbye to us while staying in whatever character he had created with the tape on his face. He had answered a question earlier about a New Year’s Resolution to sleep more, so he credited his ""new, youthful appearance” on getting more sleep. Also, fun fact: they were gonna shoot the ending from the opposite corner of the desk, but with the lynx in the same spot, so that it would be standing on the desk, behind Stephen’s shoulder. But the lynx wouldn’t turn in the right direction, so it ended up being between Stephen and the camera, and Stephen asked the trainer if he could pet it. And there you go. Also, when the lynx came out originally, they started projecting lights onto the ceiling towards the end of the segment, for the lynx (and some ADD-addled audience members, like me apparently) to watch and avoid getting bored. It was very cute."	t5_2s3hr	True
