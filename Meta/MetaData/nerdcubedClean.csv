Should we have a Dad³ Channel? 

First thing to say is that this won't take time away from my channel. (I'll still do father and son-days too) It will be gaming videos that my Dad makes entirely by himself. Probably a bit more standard playthroughs then you get on my channel but still comedy in tone.

Just wondering what the interest is in a channel run by a 58 year old? :D

1. The playlist videos are in order how i uploarded them. But i want the latest video as the first one.
http://s1.directupload.net/file/d/3192/3g97pice_png.htm

2. Go on edit playlist.
    On the right side there is a ""Quick sort by"" dropdown menu.
    Choose ""Date"" or ""Reverse""
    Click ""DONE""
    http://s1.directupload.net/file/d/3192/jhftcm9e_png.htm

3. Now the playlist order should be changed on the mainchannelpage.

We've heard it a million times already, I really like Dan's videos but I don't think we need to hear that every time he makes a video about an old game.

1374420738.0	1ir4rw	PSA: New Posting Rules	Mattophobia	117	6	44	"I've been meaning to make this for a while! Here are some new posting rules:

1. Posts must be **directly** Nerdcubed or Nerdcubed community related. - What do I mean by this? Well, a X-post from /r/Funny of a evil duck is not directly Nerdcubed related, it's a meme that has been made kind of relent by the title. This is no longer allowed, posts must directly mention or be related to Nerdcubed or the fanbase. (Sale alerts for popular games Dan has played are allowed however).

2. Any requests for Nerdcubed must **not** be made as a post, they should be made on one of the following request threads: [Let's Play Requests](http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdcubed/comments/1dgqlr/nerd%C2%B3_lets_play_requests_2/), [Free 3 Game Friday Suggestions](http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdcubed/comments/1dhk9v/free_game_friday_suggestions_2/), [Nerdcubed Challenges Suggestions](http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdcubed/comments/1agkhu/nerd%C2%B3_challenges_ideas/) and [Nerdcubed Completes Suggestions](http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdcubed/comments/1a195f/nerd%C2%B3_completes_suggestions/).
If your request doesn't fit in to one of these categories then contact Dan on twitter ([@DanNerdCubed](https://twitter.com/DanNerdCubed)). There will be no exceptions for this rule, even if you try to get around it by saying ""Do you all think Dan should play this?!"" - Come on now, I'm not one for bullshit.

3. If you have a question for Nerdcubed contact him on twitter ([@DanNerdCubed](https://twitter.com/DanNerdCubed)) or wait till he does a AmA.

4. No more ""Dan isn't as good now because his videos are edited less"" threads. Dan's videos are edited less now because he was overworked and stressed editing them at the level he was, to the point where he had to go the hospital a few times. At this point these threads are just beating a dead horse and make Dan feel bad. Complains and criticism are *very* welcome and will be allowed, but this point is just way overdone now.

5. Responses to a video (Such as posting your high score that beat Dans, or complains about said video) must be posted as a comment on the video post and not posted as it's own thread.

These rules are in effect from now and I hope they'll help the subreddit for the better. That said, if you have any suggestions for other rules that should be added or things about the subreddit that should be changed, please leave them here.

I would like to offer my humble blessings and show my true dedication to you, oh Keyboard lord, and ask you for the pain of accepting me as your humble servant. We will forever love and cherish you.

Humbly yours,

I have been a subscriber since you were making vlogs and I have noticed some changes. You seem to edit your videos considerably less, one of the reasons I fell in love with your videos is you had a unique new way of editing videos ( I know you said you were inspired by ""My drunk kitchen"" but i mean for game-play). You also make A LOT more observational humor as appose to talking about actual game-play and plot. You also are quite cynical and nit-picky when it comes to AAA games, and not with indie games. So here are some suggestions from a long time viewer and subscriber
1. Edit more
2. Talk about the game
3. Don't immediately assume AAA games are bad and over-hyped (Most recent example is Tomb Raider)

tl;dr
I am a long time procrastinator that thinks you should go back to your old days of a lot of editing and less observational humor.

Thanks :D

1357483296.0	16280h	PROCRASTINATORS! THIS IS A CALL TO ATTENTION! 	Mattophobia	103	27	198	"Remember the NerdCubed Minecraft Server that started? Well it's expanding! Here's the plan:

The server will consist of 4-5 worlds:

1 will be the spawn in which there will be 3-4 portals.

3 of those portals will lead to three different worlds. A PVP survival (Mad and unmoderated), a Donators only Co-op survival (Friendly and moderated) and a Creative Plot world.

There will be a 4th world for special events and will not always be open.

**NOW** how big this server will be is down to you guys! First of all, I need a vote of how many people want to come onto the server because that'll determine how much power we need. Secondly, donations! I can't afford to pay for this powerful of a server so it'll be paid for by donations (Hopefully).

By donating £5 (Need to pay the server bills here :p) or more you will get a little flair on the server as well as your name added to the donation board at the spawn. But most importantly you will gain access to the donator only co-op survival which will be a friendly survival world in which you have a house and a job and you only build your house/estate and workplace and such. Dan may or may not play in this world from time to time (Shhh). **Also, make sure you add your Minecraft username when you donate otherwise you won't get access to the donator world (There's a little drop-down box).**

The fate of this server is down to you! Pleae leave a comment to say wether you'd play regularly on this server and please donate if you can (It's a dedicated paypal in which all money goes towards the server). If everything goes to plan the server should be up in a couple of weeks.

**The fate of this server is in your hands!**

Donation link: *We're currently not accepting donations. When the website is up we will have a new donation system*

- Mattophobia

P.S. The world from the current server will become a museum on the new server and some builds will be used at the spawn or moved onto creative plots. Some large builds may be moved into the project world. We'll see. :p

P.P.S. This is an Unofficial NerdCubed Server which will be ran by me and SN4T14. Dan will pop on and such, but he's not running it. :p

Back in the Theme Hospital video, Dan saw the TV Personalities syndrome/disease and jokingly said ""I can present a cookery show! What do we think: My Nerd Kitchen?"" I thought that maybe, since Dan said he enjoys cooking and food in general, for the next channel milestone (1.5 million subs, 200 million video views, etc) he could create an episode of said cookery show. Maybe he could cook Food Wishes' baby back ribs, since Dan said they are great, or just whatever.

Another YouTuber who I think Dan watches, Robbaz, did something similar to this and created an episode of ""Cooking With the Kock"", in which he made blood pancakes. That could sort of give an idea of how this could work. Tomorrow I may be able to post a link to that video; I can't right now as I'm on a mobile device.

1355618800.0	14x3lu	The Unofficial NerdCubed Subredditity Game Giveaway Thingymabob! - Week 1: SUPER HEXAGON	Mattophobia	65	8	93	"So, this is a new thing I plan to run every week for all the NerdCubed fans out there.

Every Saturday I'll be giving away a Steam copy of a game Dan has done a video on. Wether it be a small game or a AAA game like Far Cry 3. The competition will be open for exactly a week. The winner will then be announced on the post which will be for the next giveaway and so on! I'll be running this every week for the foreseeable future. 

This weeks prize is **Super Hexagon**. Here's the video Dan did on it if you'd don't know/remember: http://youtu.be/iaeK9ZTh_OY - You will also be make ""Player of the Week"" on the Nerd³ Steam Group (If you're a member).

A Few Rules:

1. You will be disqualified if you enter more then once.

2. Everybody who is a subscriber to 'OfficiallyNerdCubed' on YouTube is eligible to enter (Except for me and Dan of course).

3. The winner will be chosen at random using a random number generator. 

Now, here's the link to the Google Docs form for you to fill in to enter! Before anybody complains, yes it goes through AdFly - But it's because I want to try and make this self-sustaining as I'm not exactly rich. :p I shall be making no money off this, if I start to make a profit that money will be spent on more or bigger game to giveaway. **So please, disable AdBlocker before clicking the link**. :p

Link to Enter:

http://adf.ly/G1LkL

**UPDATE: Please make sure you have Steam Guard turned on as we cannot trade otherwise. If you turn it on then you'll be able to trade 15 days later (Bloody annoying). So make sure it's on if you want your prize!**

You see, Im @Eddie0309 on twitter, and one day you talked about a game. You said it was better on the PS Vita than the 3ds, and I, as a joke, wrote ""3ds hater"". I dont know what crossed my mind to say that, but I did. I guess I was thinking of a way to say ""Why you gotta hate on the 3ds?"" That probably just made me look like a fanboy. I never meant to try and offend you in anyway neither do I criticize people by what console they use. Im writing this to say Im sorry that I offended you and I hope that you see it in you that I deserve to be unblocked from following you. I have been trying to contact you in any way I can, failing each time. I literally just made a Reddit account, not even knowing how to use it, just to hopefully get this message to you. I miss following you and reading your jokes and statements. Not to mention getting updates on when videos come out. Thats the main reason I followed you. And thats when I noticed that there are even more reasons I SHOULD follow you. Again, Im @Eddie0309. I hope you take this into consideration. I want to be a procrastinator again.

Thank you"	t5_2thfq	True

PSA: Duck and Shark Posts

&gt;Right, There's been a lot of posts lately featuring random pictures of ducks or photoshopped sharks. While is was amusing at first it's gotten to the point were they've became pretty annoying and repetitive. So I ask that you guys please tone back such posts. There are so many jokes to reference, focusing on two is pretty boring. It'd also be nice to see some more OC on here, the OC I do see is always really good. :p Just no more damn x-posts of vague things.

I love his hat and ponytail combnation.

I love how he always seems on Dan's wavelength. 

I love how he brings us brilliance.

One of his videos I just caught: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTRJG_-AJjU&amp;list=WL89E3479E1496D54D made me think about what I am doing with adblock...

I guess I have always just set it and forgot about it in the past.

He is the first person who has ever got me to add an exclusion to adblock, I have now turned it off on Youtube. Although that might turn more into a turning it off for his channel and my other subscriptions than a turnoff for everyone, depends on how annoying they are.

But, good job. I have finally found an entertainer worthy of me watching something completely annoying and unrelated so that he gets paid for his work.

Some people and I are trying to get together a fan video for when Dan hits 1,000,000 subs. We're finding some of the best NerdCubed moments, and Dunga is editing them all together. Anybody can participate in this project. Simply find what you think are Dan's best moments (this could be copious amounts of swearing, deaths, funny quotes, etc.) Then, post them at this link: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdcubed/comments/1f9gdf/best_vid

In this specific format:

For example:

* ""John Wardley"" removes height restrictions when building coasters
* ""Chris Sawyer"" all peeps start clapping and cheering
* ""James Hunt"" You get a DUNE BUGGY to drive around. And run peeps over. (They don't die, although they might fall into the water...)
* ""Make Me Sick"" all guests vomit
* ""D Lean"" lets you set up a cinematic flying camera
* ""Rick Griffiths"" makes your tunnels 100% sharkier
* ""Mornington Crescent"" lets you build stalls underground
* ""A Hitchcock"" the ducks invade en masse - to battle stations!

There's probably more that I don't know about, but these ones sound like they could see use during the series.

I hope you find a chance to use some of these!

I've been in the game industry for over 8 years now and as the years have past, my love for gaming has only ever grown. However, as any dev will tell you, your craft does take over your life so I spend a hell of a lot of time making things, and actually have very insignificant amounts of free time left for actually playing games 'just for the fun of it' these days. 

Enter Dan and his videos... I can watch a couple during a lunch break, and still get that feeling that I've experienced the fun that I relate to playing video games and actually feel like I've played a couple a fair amount, all while eating a sandwich. Jump cuts in lets plays was a stroke of genius! Cutting these things into manageable sizes while still getting a good chunk suitable to really understand the game.

I'm especially fond of the ones where you go off the pre-designed gameplay loop somewhat, treating these games as toys, seeing how far you can push the engines... such as in the crashtastic vid and the sims series (which was genuinely hilarious). Also, it's great to see you set yourself out of context challenges, like in aerofly FS where you were determined to land :) 
It's all a great reminder to me of the pure fun had when gaming for the fun, rather than for research and really makes me want to make more and better games to see this kind of fun continue.

So Mr. Dan Sir, I thank you!"	t5_2thfq	True

This is an appreciation post for the admins, but mostly for Matt. For those of you who don't know (and you probably should be this point) [Mattophobia](http://www.reddit.com/user/Mattophobia) (Or more commonly known as Matt) is pretty much the reason we still have a subreddit, apart from the fact that we submit and everything. Here's an idea of how much Matt does around here:

* Matt does weekly giveaways of games Dan has played, and gets nothing for it. Some games are donated, but mostly he pays for them out of his own pocket ** *because he can* **!! We are currently on week 16, and the easter week he gave away 11 indie games.
* Plus the current logo competition which he is also offering a steam voucher for the winning logo (link [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdcubed/comments/1bdmts/logo_competition/) )
* Matt is also big on making sure things run smoothly on this reddit, the Nerdcubed_MCserver reddit and other various places as well as being a big influence (and creator/mastermind behind the server site, teamspeak server etc? Don't quote me on that though) on the MC server itself.

This is just a few of the many things he does. I think that Matt deserves all the love we can give him, as well as any other mod/admin from the Nerd^3 servers/Reddits that you want to thank. 

So thank you Matt for being an amazingly wonderful human being, a procrastinator and a guy who just cares. As I've said before, you deserve a knighthood. So I dub thee Sir Matt of the Nerd^3 reddit and associated sites and places. Excuse the cheesiness."	t5_2thfq	True

On the most recent video, a youtuber commented that Dad^3 needs a theme tune. I think the woohoo that Steve does at the beginning is more than adequate as a theme tune, what do you guys think?


Also, somebody else commented that perhaps the Procrastinators that are on the Dad^3 channel should be called something slightly different. I bring forth a few suggestions! One is the Precrastinators, the Pre part referring to the fact that Steve predates Dan. Alternately it could be the Postcrastinators due to the fact that the Dad^3 channel postdates the Nerd^3 one. The third suggestion I bring forth is the Prodadstinators, which is a bit of a mouthful. All suggestions brought from the YouTube comments section.

1. [Dan said that he will be running an experiment through May.](https://twitter.com/DanNerdCubed/status/329007028318121984)
2. [He wants to drop videos to 720p so he can upload faster.](https://twitter.com/DanNerdCubed/status/329479847866945536)
3. [He says that unedited videos are really easy to do.](https://twitter.com/DanNerdCubed/status/329008464904994818)
4. [The experiment begins today!](https://twitter.com/DanNerdCubed/status/329481185791201280)

I will be very surprised if I'm wrong. 720p videos means he can upload them twice as fast, and uploading is currently the main chokepoint for unedited videos.

With the amount of series he has going on at the moment (FGF, Son-days, RTC3, InTheLittleCubed, Elite Force) he can only upload one video per series per week. That means it could take him almost a year to complete Elite Force, and those videos are really simple to do - no editing required. BUT, if he started uploading 2 videos every day, it would be a win/win situation - more videos for us, faster series and more ad revenue for him."	t5_2thfq	True

1374924989.0	1j5mq4	Congratulations Dan	NerdcubedHuman	32	6	8	"I, nerdcubedhuman, am happy to announce that dan has reached the prestigious 1,000,000 subscribers on his [main youtube account](https://www.youtube.com/user/OfficialNerdCubed). I would like to start with saying congrats dan, you earned this and so much more :). Second i would like to thank you for all the many hours of entertainment that you have given me personally and the whole of this community.

Now i would like to thank some other persons...

First of i would like to thank wot for all the work he has put into the [IRL-channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Officiallynerdcubed) even though we all know that he is going trough a very difficult time right now, and the only thing i would like to say about this is:

**we love you wot, the entire community loves you and you should never forget that!**

Well now that that is out of the way.
I would like to thank this community, and with this community i mean the entirety of the nerd^3 community (yes also the yt comment section people). You (or actually ""we"") are the once that made him this big, we are the once who helped dan expand to become the youtuber he is today and i think we should all be (kinda) proud of ourself for that (not too proud though, this community has some rotten apples in it).

Next i would like to thank matt, seriously the amount of work that matt has put in this place and the fan servers is insane. He has to manage a fairly large subreddit all by himself, he has to make sure that we all have fan servers where we can play all day and enjoy ourself, and most of the money payed for this comes from him and he does weekly giveaways where he gives away not so cheap games (again mostly from his own money)

Next up is SN4T14 and for those of you that don't know he created and manages [the bot](http://www.reddit.com/user/nerdcubedbot) and manages the behind-the-scenes of the servers (quite a bit of work for one man).

Now the next one i don't really know so well, this is mostly because i don't play on the fan-servers. I would like to thank all the moderators and administrators on the fan-servers.
You guys keep that place spinning by making sure that we show some manors, respect and in general don't act like total immature idiots. 

Next i would like to thank steve, dan's dad. You are hilarious and i am happy that dan showed us this and gave you your own channel, keep doing what you are doing, it works.

Now i think that i have showed every person who deserved it some love (i might have forget someone though).

So now i would like to get back to the reason we are all here, dan reaching his first (of many that are yet to come) million subscribers. Dan you are one of the best youtubers (if not the best) that i have ever have the pleasure of watching, you deserve plenty more subscriber and i grantee you  that if you keep making contents like you are now that you will get a lot more subscribers and fans in general. You know that we all love you and want you to become even bigger than you are now, so that one day we can say i knew him before he got big. 

Lastly i just want to say we love you dan, never stop doing what you are doing (unless it makes you happy).

:)

On page 21, (you should read all the way to there, even through the introduction, there are some good lines in the introduction) he explains. Under each comic , he explains where the ideas for that days comic comes from, or some other random fact that popped into his head. 

Nerd³ comes from the fact that he was a nerd, and the comic, which started him off, was based in a world only made of cubes. Minecraft.

Same rules as last time, you'll be disqualified if you enter this weeks giveaway more then once and you must be subscribed to NerdCubed.

P.S. - I had a little video made for the lot of you as a Christmas present. It's tiny and silly, but better then 'nout. Go watch it here: http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdcubed/comments/15a0op/merry_christmas_to_rnerdcubed/

I've created this thread for the purposes of requesting a certain game for Dan to do a Lets Play of. I've noticed self posts popping up requesting him to do certain games, all that really does is clutter up the homepage before they get lost forever. 

So if you have a Lets Play request for Dan, please post it as a comment on this thread. Please Note: This thread was not made because Dan is taking requests (But it doesn't mean he won't!), it was made to stop clutter. 

P.S. Please check before you post if the game you want to suggest has already been suggested and upvote it instead. To do this, search the page using Control + F on Windows or Command + F on a Mac.

After watching your most recent vlog, I was reminded of when KurtjMac did a vlog of him recording his Far Lands or Bust from a third-person view.

Thanks, Dan, for providing a wonderful and entertaining youtube channel that updates several days a week. Even after an overzealous fan and some occasional rough times, you provide an excellent show. I might disagree with you politically but you've won me over in terms of comedy.

Thanks, Matt, for running this subreddit. Without your help, we wouldn't have any of the nice things (eg. ducks and lightning up/downvotes, the weekly giveaway, etc). So well done to you Matt for making this sub infinitely better than anything I could make.

Also a brief thanks to SN4T14 for setting up and running the N³ fan server of Dan's minecraft map. I'm sure a lot of people love it.

1364764071.0	1bdmts	Logo Competition!	Mattophobia	29	7	62	"Hello Procrastinators!

It's competition time! We need a logo for the new Nerdcubed Servers Website. It has to be in the Nerdcubed Cartoony style but look different enough that it won't be confused as official!

You can use whatever imagine program you want, but the file format must be PNG and it must be high resolution. Or for the most advanced graphic designers, I will also accept Adobe Illustrator files!

We need a logo icon. It must be a high resolution icon logo to represent the server both on the website, but on the game servers themselves and the teamspeak. It must have equal dimensions (I.e 1024x1024). It must have a transparent background and it must not contain any text (A letter or two is okay though) as it will be use globally and some of those areas it will have to be very low resolution. It but symbolically portray Nerdcubed Fanservers and it must be clean and simple! 

The logo also has to be created by YOU. You cannot use any copyrighted images in your entry. Also keep in mind that this is not just for a Minecraft server. It has to be a general logo that can encompass all the game servers as well as future ones.

The winning entry will be used as the official logo for the servers and a £20 (Or your regional equivalent) Steam Wallet voucher!

The deadline for this competition is Midday (GMT) on Sunday the 7th of April 2013. Please post a imgur link to your image in the comments to enter! If you win you will e contacted for a higher resolution version. :p

- Matt

EDIT - Something I need to make clear is that the logo has to be different from the Nerdcubed logo. A whole new logo! It just needs to fit with the Nerdcubed theme! So please remember this when creating your stuff. It can't just be the Nerdcubed logo with servers stuck to the end of it, or a different Nerdcubed Logo Idea. **It has to be totally new, but at the same time show that it is to do with Nerdcubed. A lot of creativity is required!**

EDIT 2 - I obviously haven't been clear enough about the kind of logo that is needed. Something simple, that looks good big and small and can represent Nerdcubed Fanservers without looking like an official Nerdcubed thing but still sticking to the theme. Here are some examples of what I mean [1](http://www.peelfashionstore.com/wp-content/uploads/Facebook-skins-post-1024x1024.png), [2](http://blog.gremln.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/new_twitter_logo.jpg), [3](http://api.ning.com/files/Fd0Hyt-VB-mLJyE6xLYZ**QLu2VVQfvnaIEzyxSO11rwdkqRti2q4ra1ES1p8jr1BpSEJSaRTmqdCOv-6CXzMGxmhyl-gUex/applelogo.gif), [4](http://media.steampowered.com/steamcommunity/public/images/avatars/1d/1d2fc9a4ebc452c3594ca73cc5480908b19b1f38_full.jpg). Simple, elegant and looks good at both a 16x16 resolution as well as 1024x1024, so when designing, please look at it at a small resolution (About the size of the up and downvote buttons) as well as a high resolution, it has to look good in both. It also **Can't look official**. I'm seeing a lot of entires which are simply variants on the Nerdcubed logo, or the Nerdcubed logo with bits added. We need a totally new logo! But it still needs to keep with the cartoony fun theme of Nerdcubed. So, different but still relatable. Clean and simple, but represents the server. I have taken out the bit about a text logo as it's being easily misconstrued. "	t5_2thfq	True

1364859856.0	1bh291	Some ideas for the Garry's Mod Fanserver (Warning: Wall of Text)	Im_Not_A_Tree	24	2	15	"So, I'm quite happy that the Gmod Fan Server is open; although it does need a bit of work.
Please excuse this, as I understand it just opened, but I think it's still necessary to say the problems and how to fix them.

First, problems with the server right now:

1. DarkRP is hard to moderate.

It's going to take more moderators than what we have to make sure the server is safe from rulebreakers. I'm not sure what system you plan to take for this, if any system at all.

2.DarkRP is way too commonly used for servers.

By the time of posting this, the listed amount of Garry's Mod DarkRP Servers is 583, with 3868 Players. Assuming that all the servers have an equal amount of players, (I know they don't but this is for demonstration) we can calculate that all the servers have an average of 7 players on them at all times. If you haven't played DarkRP before, you usually need around 15-25 players on for it to be fun, depending on what you think is fun. Also by the time of posting this, it has 13 players on. Good, but it did just launch. I'm not sure how many will stay when the initial wave of people dies down.

Now then, those are the big issues. Now, my ideas.

1. Switch to a different Gamemode.

Sandbox, Garry's Mod Stranded, or Cinema would be some good ones. However, there are many others. Garry's Mod stranded has 27 Servers and 173 Players right now; Bringing an average of 5 Players per server.
""Wait a minute!"" I hear you saying to your computer screen for some odd reason. ""That's less than DarkRP!"" Yes, that's true. However, unlike DarkRP, Garry's Mod Stranded does not need as many players for it to be fun. It's not a roleplay, and if you don't want it to be, not a team effort. You could happily play on your own for hours on end- or, if you wish, create a tribe with multiple people. Plus,  if we assume that 7 people on the DarkRP server are just random people, not procrastinators; then a happy bunch of 6 out of the 13 may gladly switch over to the new gamemode; 11 people.
It's also quite easy to install, both serverside and clientside. For Serverside, [follow this guide](http://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Workshop_for_Dedicated_Servers), adding the [Garry's Mod Stranded Workshop Item](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=133364818) to the collection. Choose the map you wish. For clientside, just subscribe to the [Garry's Mod Stranded Workshop Item](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=133364818) and you're done. Cinema has the exact same installation on both Serverside and Clientside; Replacing Garry's Mod Stranded With Cinema. Sandbox requires no installation.
Yes, i haven't even explained what each gamemode is. Garry's Mod stranded is hard to explain; ~~I'm sure there's a guide or similar somewhere.~~ [Found it!](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=135129872#) Cinema is playing youtube videos for other people, and Sandbox is building things.

2. If you wish to stay with DarkRP, employ more Moderators/ Administrators. Perhaps an application system? I do not know. You're on your own for that one.

3. Create more jobs. I do not know how to do this, as I have never run a DarkRP Server before. However, the default set is lacking in choices and enemies. Another gang, maybe? An Explosives/Black Market Dealer?

4. Attach more addons. Extra guns, Explosives, and others will greatly increase the player count.

And that's all for now. If you have any more ideas, or wish to battle mine, feel free to comment.

**TL;DR:** Read it, please. It took me about an hour to type this.

**Edit:** I found a gamemode guide for GMStranded, [here](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=135129872#)."	t5_2thfq	True

And then his sackboy lands on top of the logo and ducks rain down as they get zapped by lightning while nerf darts fly everywhere or something.

I need all the artsy people out there to take part in a competition! I need people to create funny Nerdcubed related art to be used as a 404 error (I.e. The Fail Whale, etc.) on the new website for the game servers. 

They need to be good looking, in PNG form with a transparent background and reasonably sized (So they look good on big and small monitors). Preferably cartoony styled with Dan in some crashed situation with a quote of his. Remember, the 404 page is suppose to represent ""This page does not exist"", ""You have taken a wrong turn"", Etc.

I may choose one good one or I may just choose all of them and let the website choose one at random. IT SHALL BE WONDERFUL. But either way I shall be giving a game (Not sure what, but a good one Dan has played) to the one I think is the best! Post a link to a high res version of your entry in the comments!

1. Games
2. Who's participating
3. Who's recording
4. Microphones? As in should we talk?
5. Editing?

People showing support for idea:

Ringleaders? Myself and mkdhdh seem to be them

Recorder:???

Participants: THIS IS WHERE YOU ALL COME IN: khurley424, xilyflob, chili6f

Dan just mentioned in a post on here that he's recorded videos for several games in the GTA series that just weren't funny enough. He's recorded them, probably not edited them, but why not put them up for those that would still like to see it? I would definitely be for something like this.

The unworthy video idea is actually not the main reason I would watch a third channel: the real reason is posting entirely unedited videos. We all know that Dan records a couple hours of footage for each video, which gets whittled down to the short versions we know and love. He edits them to the funniest bits. But who's to say there's not other funny stuff we never see?

I guess the best example of why this might be a good idea at all is Minecraft, where we could see the whole building process. Though I guess there hasn't been one of those in a while, so maybe the point is moot. 

So what do you guys think of something like this? I've just had this idea for a while now and wanted to share."	t5_2thfq	True

Best: Nerd³ Plays..., Father and Son Days

Worst: In the Little³, Star Trek

1. when you see that dan posted a new video, **always** first check if someone hasn't posted a link already, you can best check this by going to the [new page](http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdcubed/new/) of this subreddit.

2. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, USE THE ACTUAL VIDEO TITLE! THERE IS A [BUTTON](http://puu.sh/2p7lW) SPECIALLY DEDICATED TO IT, **USE IT**. i've seen too many ppl posting links to dan's video's and then getting deleted because they didn't use the proper title.

3. when (if) the bot is repaired all video's on dan's main channel, his vlog channel and probably also his dad's channel will be posted by the bot, i don't care if you can beat the bot, your post will be deleted. there is a reason the bot (is supposed to) exists, and that reason is to keep everything nice and organized, and also some other reason but i won't go into those.

if you break any of these rules your post will be deleted by mat and i will facepalm because of your stupidity.

thank you for understanding the fact that there need to be rules, even for the small things."	t5_2thfq	True

1361564992.0	191h6r	ANNOUNCEMENT: We need your thoughts	Mattophobia	16	2	24	"So if you remember about a month and a half ago we started collecting donations for the /r/Nerdcubed Minecraft server, well we're expanded since then and we needs your thoughts. 

So, we got a powerful dedicated server for Minecraft, but the Minecraft server isn't being used as much as we anticipated so we've been able to set up other game servers on the same machine (TF2, OpenTTD and soon CS:GO). Our plan is to have a big lineup of gameservers for all you procrastinators to play on!

But here's the problem, to do that we need a powerful social hub to do everything out of as a subreddit is pretty limited. One of the biggest things we need for this expansion is a constant flow of money (To pay the bills). My plan is to use vBulliten to create a very powerful site and fourm which would be able to manage all staff, applications, users, complaints, suggestions, announcements, service updates, donations (Which will have many tiers with benifts in all games and there will also be a few monthly subscription based donation options for awesome shit).

Now, we already have a webhost and a domain name. The thing we need to pay for is vBulliten. I want to use vBulliten as it is an extremely powerful industry standard for forums and it also has everything we need built right in (Not to mention it comes with a simple to use web editor which means we could make the sites really fast).

Why am I telling you all this? Well it's because you're the ones who donated and it's your decision how the money is spent (As it was originally intended just for the Minecraft Server). Buying a vBulliten licence costs £170. We currently have £360 in the Paypal account and we're spending about £110 a month on hosting and such. So if we were to buy it we'd take a big hit. So it'd like to know your opinions on this (Or if you have any better ideas)! I also want to push donations again as we want to get this all set up, so you can donate here to the server fund! http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdcubed/comments/16280h/procrastinators_this_is_a_call_to_attention/

- Matt

Edit: I just want to point out that the main reason for this post was to ask **should we spend £170 on the vBullitin system when we currently have £360, which would leave enough money left for 1 months server rental (Which we just renewed)?**"	t5_2thfq	True

1351887899.0	12j5cd	FTL mods - (Tutorial and links)	Stryxic	17	3	5	"Righto people, seeing as this will be my first post here, I thought I should make myself useful. If like me you instantly bought FTL after Dan told you too, then you may find this interesting. A few days ago I discovered the sheer wonder of the FTL mods. Now, you wonderful people, I want to share that wonder I felt with you!

First things first, you want to grab yourself a copy of [Grognak's Mod Manager](http://www.mediafire.com/?jervwqbiuwo05hp)(GMM). Then you want to (and I will go through as if you are using Firefox, so if you can translate it to whichever browser you use. Unless you use IE, at which point I think you have more pressing concerns) go to the 'Downloads' section, and open up the containing folder for the FTL.exe file. Personally, as I am running Windows 7 and got it from GoG, it was found in My Computer &gt; C:\ &gt; Program Files (x86) &gt; GOG.com &gt; Faster Than Light. Copy the contents of the downloaded file into there, and VOILA! Step one is done.

 Step two - Download the .ftl file from the links I give you (I haven't gotten any viruses from them, but feel free to be as paranoid as you want) and place it into the Mods folder of the files you just copied over.

Step three - Run the Modman.exe file, select the mods you want, and press patch. Easy as that.

**Note - All following mods come from** [Here](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=2645)

From that point, I suggest you get the following mods-

[No rebel fleet, but still an end boss. MediaFire.](http://www.mediafire.com/?o9e58ddps0mgleb) This little beauty makes for a rather interesting experience in which you essentially get a HUGE amount of scrap and basically can fly about unlocking all the ships. Good if you want a very-easy mode of FTL. If you are more masochistic however..

[HARD MODE. Dropbox.](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21010722/HardDif.ftl) Think that no fleet is too easy? Try this as well, to give it a bit more flavour and have yourself an interesting experience.

[Better art. MediaFire.](http://www.mediafire.com/?oaqjqnuzo2d8j9b)
Pretty much what it says on the tin, just better background graphics for the game. They do indeed look far better, so I suggest you get this if you feel like a bit of a nice feel.

Those are three I suggest you start off with, and I hope this has been informative! Now get out there and beat the Goram rebel scum back to where they came from!"	t5_2thfq	True

* It's a simulator
* It's the longest video he has ever made (makes road trip look short)

This is a vague guess but I think that the simulator he is talking about is [Desert Bus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_%26_Teller's_Smoke_and_Mirrors# Desert_Bus) which can be played [here](http://desertbus-game.org/).
It is difficult to explain what it is but the gist is you drive from Tuscon to Las Vegas in real time (8 hours), the game is dull; repeating a single piece of artwork for the road and desert. The game cannot be paused and requires constant attention. If you slip off road you have to restart. I don't know how Dan could be entertaining for 8 hours but it is a possibility with the help of video editing.

It's an odd idea but what do you think?

I loved it immediately, and felt I would watch it like a boxset starting from the first video and carrying on. However I now find myself in a predicament of being permanently stuck 3 months behind the new content.

1368486877.0	1e9zt1	Donations for Dan? What do you all think?	Cuive	18	4	18	"Alright, so I was reading around the Nerdcubed Reddit and noticed this entry in particular:

http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdcubed/comments/1djq07/nerdcubeds_statsheep_page_is_saying_that_he_lost/c9r071x

So here's the deal. I don't know if Dan would or wouldn't be able to, or even want to, set up something for donations. However, I feel, and I'm sure many of you do as well, that him making such a measly sum, while being one of the best personalities (on or off net), is downright wrong.

Therefore, if anyone's interested in the ability to send cash directly to Dan, just upvote this so he can see. http://nerdcubed.co.uk/ is currently still under construction, but I'd happily shoot him 5-10 bucks a month via a Donate Button just to know that Dan is making the money I feel he deserves for what he does for all of us.

I'm not sure if this would at all conflict with his current contracts or deals, but if we show him setting it up is worth it, maybe he'll give us a chance to lend a helping hand.

Whatdya say folks? Let me (and most especially, Dan!) know what you think! I'm just putting my idea out there in hopes that we can all help him out just a little more

Oh, and Dan: Please don't feel like we're pitying your or whatever. Honestly, since I've subscribed to your channel, I haven't missed a single video. You're brilliantly smart, opinionated but fair, and you know how to interject humour into anything and everything you touch. Money is the best way to show appreciation in today's world. NOW LET US APPRECIATE YOU!!! *THROWS MONEY AT DAN LIKE HE'S A STRIPPER* ^_^"	t5_2thfq	True

I had read one or two pages of the comic, but not much else. I assumed it was the un-noteworthy part of NerdCubed. I moved on to the vlogs (Still waiting on a new TubeCast Dan!), and now I want something more. A large part of the community seems to be centered around the comics, so I want to read them, but alas.. they're hidden away somewhere for Dan's new website. Could Dan, or anyone for that matter, just post some of the first comics on? I trust Dan's wit for a nice experience in his writing, but his writing is nowhere to be found! :(

I don't mean like ""Why isn't Dan a celebrity yet?"". No, i mean like if people actually see that Dan works extremely hard each day and take notice of it. And also, why?

I truly believe that Dan is an incredible and unique YouTuber. He is almost at the reach of 1 mill subs (yay!) considering that he (and us) had to go through tough times (Sasha's death, fan on door).

Compilation of Dan swearing and Doctor Who references//
I want as many people as possible on the minecraft server at the same time (in the same place) then there's just a wave of people saying thank you :D//
A showcase of his minecraft Buildy Thing//
A showcase of the awesome fan builds on the server//
A '13 ways to die' on ducks//

That should wrap up to about 3 minutes if we're lucky, let me know what you think/want to change, I want this to be ALL of our work! :D

The new Nerdcubed Minecraft Fan server is now OPEN! Yaaaay! Because this is a new server there may be problems, so the first 24 may be a little bumpy and there may be restarts to fix things.

The current server has been closed and the world file can be downloaded here: http://www.mediafire.com/?nhqneqw4nnpwjlw

The old world is also on the new server for staff use so we can copy unfinished builds and such. You can request you build be moved by using /helpop on the new server

We also have a custom texture! It's just an art pack. You can download the default texture pack with the new art files here: http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?4ux6d6xbua5di44 OR you can replace the art file in the texture pack of your choice with our custom one! You can download it here: http://www.mediafire.com/?spa53bssj5p2gak 

The new server IP is mc.nerdcubedservers.co.uk

Make sure you read the rules using /rules

We have also closed the Mumble server! We have upgraded to a 72 slot TeamSpeak 3 server! You can download teamspeak here: http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads

The Teamspeak IP is: ts3.nerdcubedservers.co.uk:20027 - Make sure you include the :20027. I am working on making it so you don't have to add the port. :p

It's been quite a bit of work, so we hope you enjoy! Thank you especially to all the donators, we couldn't have done it without you!

I'm making an LBP2 level with a bunch of Nerd³-related stuff! So far it has a remake of the intro (along with an unfinished recreation of Plucky Daisy, the piano song he uses for it), a floating ""Hello, procrastinators!"" at the start, and a short (unfinished!!) segment riding Sasha. Later I'm gonna have something about killing ducks, Sasha-computer exploding and filling the level with water, and something about Far Cry 3. And probably more stuff.

Anyway, I'm probably gonna need help with just about everything; the Nerd³ logo in the intro, making things actually look nice, and...well, everything. So yeah! My If you haven't figured it out yet, my PSN is TheGiik."	t5_2thfq	True
