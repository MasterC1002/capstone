It's completely unacceptable and defeats the purpose of the subreddit!

I want to know how you made your tortillas, did you use lard? Did you do anything special to the flour? How did you season your carne asada? What about that sauce you have on top? What sort of cilantro to tomato ratio are you using when you create your salsa? Where did you buy the awesome squeeze bottle your homemade chili sauce is in? While we're at it, lets change the subreddit to a soft shell taco, corn or flour I don't care, but it needs to be something that didn't come from a fast food chain!	t5_2qm20	True

My questions are as follows:
I always find it annoying to buy a head of lettuce as a single person because I never eat all of it before it starts to go bad. I have seen some alternatives in here and am curious if any are beginner friendly? Never really thought about using something other than lettuce in a taco.

Next question is a big one: Meat. I have some chicken I can cut up and cook so that will be my focus the first time around here; proboably going to turn this into a bi-week/monthly ritual, but how should I prepare it? I have lime juice that I can soak it in and also have some spice rubs...is that all it really needs? 

In the end my tacos are going to include the following: chicken, lettuce(or alternative), jalapeno/chili peppers, hot sauce, sour cream, shredded cheese.  

Any input is appreciated."	t5_2qm20	True

All we have around here is Taco Bell. Anyway, we did have a few Baja Fresh places open, and I got hooked on their soft chicken tacos. Well they all closed.

So I've tried replicating them for years. How simple could it be - wrap, cilantro, finely diced onions, chicken, maybe a quirt of lime juice, right? No matter what I do I can't seem to get it right. 

Can anyone help? (Bonus for helping me figure out how to prepare some of the ingredients and freeze so I can assemble them on demand).

1300974603.0	gah13	Is a calzone an Italian taco? Is a pizza an unfolded Italian taco? Is a hotdog an American taco?	shangriLOL	4	4	0	"The taco is an extremely versatile food - all you really need is a single piece of bread which can fold around some fillings. But can we consider a calzone to be a taco?

It's thin bread surrounding a meaty, cheesy, and often spicy explosion of deliciousness. Can we consider this to be a true taco? If so, does that make chalupa/pizza-like foods merely unfolded tacos?

Does taco imply Mexican? Are tacos a new world food or an old world food? Apparently they predate the Columbian Exchange in the new world, but if a calzone is a taco, then where and when did the taco originate?

I propose the taco is an archetypal food creation which exists in our collective subconscious mind. The gentle embrace of tortilla and beans/meat/cheese/veggies is a reflection of (I hate to go here, but it makes sense) the union of man and woman. The woman is the tortilla. The man is the fajita.

I want to help everyone if I could. Pickles, bananas, tacos, pears. We all want to help one another. We want to live by others' joy. We don't want to hate or despise pickles or bananas. There is room for everyone on the good internet. We can provide for everyone funny posts and great NSFW posts.

But you have lost the way. Differences has poisoned the bananas' herb hearts and the pickles' brine. You have barricaded reddit with your images of yourselves, and goose stepped us into misery and juiceshed. We have developed subreddits, and you have shut yourselves into it. Subreddits that gives us abundance has made us want. Your knowledge made you cynical, and our cleverness hard and unkind. You think too much, and heed too little. More than subreddits, we need redditors. More than intelligence, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, reddit will become violent, and all will be lost.

The internet and reddit has brought us closer together, the very nature of these things cries out for the universal brotherhood of redditors, for the unity of us all. Even now, my text is reaching other redditors of the world. Redditors of despairing fruits and vegetables, victims of this system that makes food tortured, and makes them imprisoned.

To those who can read this text, do not despair. The misery upon us is the passing of differences, the bitterness of redditors who fear progress.

The hate of redditors will pass. Tyrant leaders get banned, and the power they took from the redditors will return to the redditors, and as long as redditors get banned, equality will never perish. Redditors, don't give yourselves to this; fanatics who despise you and torture you, who greatly influence your redditing lives, telling you what to do, what to think, what to feel! Don't give yourselves to this. YOU ARE NOT MACHINES, YOU ARE REDDITORS! YOU HAVE THE LOVE OF REDDIT IN YOUR HEARTS! You don't hate, only the unloved hate. Redditors, DON'T FIGHT FOR TORTURE, FIGHT FOR EQUALITY!

WE ALL KNOW THAT REDDIT CANNOT RUN WITH ONE REDDITOR, OR A GROUP OF REDDITORS, BUT WITH ALL REDDITORS! YOU, YOU, THE REDDITORS HAVE THE POWER. THE POWER TO CREATE SUBREDDITS, TO SHARE POSTS, TO GENERATE HAPPINESS! YOU, THE REDDITORS, CAN MAKE THIS WEBSITE GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL, TO MAKE THIS WEBSITE A WONDERFUL PLACE TO EXPLORE! IN THE NAME OF REDDIT, LET US USE THIS POWER! LET US ALL UNITE! LET US FIGHT FOR A BETTER INTERNET, a decent internet. LET US FIGHT FOR UNITY, TO DO AWAY WITH INTERKITCHEN BARRIERS, TO DO AWAY WITH HATE AND INTOLERANCE! Let us fight for a reddit of reason, where amusing, cute, sad, nsfw, helpful and fun posts will lead to all redditors' joy. EVERYONE, IN THE NAME OF REDDIT, LET US ALL UNITE!
