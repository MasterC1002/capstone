So if you're a Flyers fan and a Comcast Cable customer like myself, and you live in Central PA, all of The Flyers games on Comcast SportsNet are under black-out restrictions.

According to [this post](http://www.hockeyfights.com/forums/f14/nhl-tv-blackouts-131055/#post1868880), in which a fellow Flyers fan questioned CSN Philly, the response implies that the NHL must be contacted by a mass market to protest actions like this.

To quote:

""You will need to call the NHL and express your thoughts. The NHL has State College listed as the Penguins territory and will not broadcast Flyers games. This is why our productions are blacked out. We have been talking to the NHL for years, but all the calls and complaints will help our situation. Thank you for your interest in the Philadelphia Flyers and Comcast SportsNet.""

I posted here for two reasons.
  
First, to ask for your support in sending the NHL a meesage that we want our hockey!

But secondly, I wanted to know how wide-spread this type of problem is.

If you are under blackout restrictions for local hockey teams, I'd like to return the favor I'm asking by protesting blackouts in your market as well!

SO I PUT IT TO YOU!

---

Hello again everyone! In this post I won't go through a lot of my personal matters. However, to put it short, the summer went well and everything was fine for the new season. I have to admit that the disappointment of the lockout is huge. But let's look at this case a bit more thoroughly.

I still remember a very beautiful summer day, it was July 22nd 2005. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman announces that the year-long lockout is over and how dazzling the NHL's future looks now that the owners finally got what they wanted. Mr. Bettman was right! NHL business has grown over the lock-out from 2.3 billion to 3.3 billion. That is, almost a billion dollars, or 40 percent growth. Just to make it clear, you read it right, I'm talking about a billion!

The new salary cap has evened out the sports team level differences. NHL is tighter and more interesting than ever, the product works and the fans like it. The teams pay their players more than before. Everything should be fine. What's wrong with this then? Can ice hockey really afford to be without playing again? Damage caused by the recent lockout has just been barely repaired. Most of the fans lost during last lock-out have been recovered and they're back. Although, television giant ESPN, which rejected ice hockey and took the Texas hold'em poker in place, is still the biggest source of revenue lost.

Out of 32 teams, reportedly 22 does more or less profitable result. Teams with negative results hope that the rich teams would share part of their profits to these teams. The rich teams message is a harsh one: not a chance! If you do not know how to do your business, or you're in the wrong city, it is not our problem. Commissioner Gary Bettman has this great idea: Let's take out from the players and give it to these poor teams. But it won't be that easy, the money belongs to the core people in this circus. NHL complain that the players get too big pot (57%) of the total business. After all, the teams take the financial risk, not the players. That's true, but the NHL forget that we, the players, have risks. Every day when we put on the skates we take a calculated risk: that one bad tackle can end our career, or one skate cut can even take your life. NHL player's average duration of career is about four years. Is it unreasonable ""to accept"" take money for that? The market value of a player in NHL is clear, the teams and the organization have developed the formulas to calculate it. They know every player's value and pay accordingly.

NHL has warned teams from making too long and the front-heavy contracts. The teams don't need to do them, unless they want to. A perfect example is the Minnesota owner Craig Leipold, who is also one of the NHL's members of the group. He makes a 13 year and 100 million dollar(per player) contract with two players, Zach and Ryan Suterin and tells the hockey world how excited the entire Minnesota is of these fresh purchases. The next day, he puts his NHL-boss mask on, going to the other side of the table, and tells the same hockey world how incomprehensible are these new long-term contracts. Come on! No team is FORCED to pay such sums, and make 13 year absurd contracts. It is their decision! Don't the NHL teams know that any of the mega long-term deal has not yet been profitable to the owners? You also have to remember that during the last lock-out the 57 per cent share for the players was their offer, which we had to accept. And now, it is not enough!

Gary Bettman has been the NHL's boss for almost 20 years. He was hired by the NHL to bring the salaries, and so he did, as he had done in NBA. Twice the lockout has been on the table during his reign, and each time the lockout has been done. Now it is the third! He is certainly the NHL's most hated person. For every visit to each NHL team's home hall he gets booed by the crowds. The fans know! He himself makes more than eight million dollars a year. Would Mr. Bettman be willing to give up his salary and give part of it to these ""poor"" teams? Hmm ... interesting question.

At the same time, the players association boss Donald Fehr announced July 1st, the day when the negotiations began, that he did not want any salary until this ""war"" is over. Among the players reactions were admirable. Maybe Mr. Bettman should try to negotiate hockey back to the big TV companies, such as ESPN. The extra money would probably suit for these ""poor"" teams.

In any case, the winners in this dispute are unlikely to be found. In particular, on behalf of the fans I'm really sorry. They do not really deserve this, and you have to remember, that in end of the day, it is more or less the fans who pay our salaries and keep us going. I can only hope that this lockout would not last long, and we could go back to the joy of NHL hockey. The world's finest sport does not deserve this! I am disappointed and vainly awaiting for better news. Good games to all the fans whose leagues have already started, or are about to start!"	t5_2qrrq	True

### Game Notes:

* There were no crossover games between conferences in the shortened NHL season, so the Boston Bruins and Chicago Blackhawks did not play each other. They last met Oct. 15, 2011, at United Center, with the Bruins winning 3-2 in a shootout. Tim Thomas started that game in net for Boston, and Corey Crawford started for Chicago and made 35 saves. The prior game between the teams in Boston was March 29, 2011, with the Bruins winning 3-0. Boston forward Shawn Thornton left that game after his head was cut by a skate blade and the Bruins claimed a Blackhawks player said something to stir up harsh feelings as he left the ice.

* Two of the oldest franchises in the NHL are ready for a series that has the potential to be a classic. Not only is it the first time since 1979 that two Original Six franchises have played for the Cup -- and the first time the Bruins and Blackhawks have faced each other in the Final -- but the Blackhawks and Bruins are built similarly and play quite a bit alike. Chicago and Boston have foundations set on defense and goaltending, but have plenty of offense to go with it.

***

### Injury Report:

* Gregory Campbell (leg fracture) is out for the rest of the postseason for the Bruins.

* The Blackhawks report no injuries.

1365463586.0	1bya3d	NHL Gamecenter Live: Biggest F%@#ing Waste of Money Ever?	abierce666	59	9	83	I am a Bruins fan who finds himself living in the midwest. I find cable in general, even the most basic packages, to be a waste of money that I don't watch, as Hulu, Netflix and supposedly NHL Gamecenter should cover the things I actually watch regularly. Between NHL Network and NBC Sports though, I find that I hardly ever get to actually watch a Bruins game around here because of the local blackout. The main culprit is NHL Network, as they don't even offer their own original broadcast, since they simply pirate a local broadcast of the game to air on their network. I can understand the circumstance of NBC Sports Network and NBC causing games to be blacked out, as they do offer an original broadcast of the game with the costs of putting together the broadcast and whatnot involved. NHL Network causing my game to be blacked out is fucking ridiculous though, as they are simply taking the broadcast I'd normally watch and playing it locally, while preventing me from being able to watch the games that I paid for. I paid $50 for Gamecenter, but it feels that half the games in this strike shortened season have been blocked, most of them on account of NHL Network. This is complete horseshit that the NHL, the one selling this package online, also rebroadcasts these games on their pretty shitty network causing people who paid good money to watch hockey to be blocked on a regular basis. And as customary obliged, I blame Gary Bettman for this load of crap. Thanks a lot, Gary.	t5_2qrrq	True

***

**Time:** 12:30 PM ET, February 3, 2013

**Location:** Verizon Center, Washington, District of Columbia

**TV:** NBC, TSN2

***

**Game Notes:**

* This is the first meeting of the season. The teams split the four-game season series last year, though Washington has won nine of 12 against Pittsburgh since the Penguins won a second-round series in 2009 en route to claiming the Stanley Cup.

* These two rivals meet on Super Bowl Sunday for the third straight year, and both are coming off victories after slower than expected starts to the season.

***

**Injury Report:** 

* Defenseman Matt Niskanen (foot) is out for the Penguins.

* Forward Brooks Laich (groin) and defenseman Jack Hillen (upper body) are out for the Capitals. Defenseman Erskine is serving the first of a three-game suspension because of a hit to the head of Philadelphia's Wayne Simmonds on Friday night.

### Game Notes:

* After a suffocating 2-0 victory in Game 3 on Monday, the Boston Bruins are poised to take control of the Stanley Cup Final with a victory on Wednesday night at TD Garden (8 p.m. ET). The Bruins took advantage of a surprise health issue that scratched Chicago Blackhawks star right wing Marian Hossa with an undisclosed upper-body injury after the pre-game warm up. Goalie Tuukka Rask got credit for a shutout, but the defense in front of him snuffed out almost all good scoring chances for the Blackhawks.

* Chicago also got drubbed in the faceoff circle, losing 40 of 56 draws for a paltry 29 percent success rate. Boston used that advantage to dominate puck possession and outskate the Blackhawks almost the entire game. Now, it’s up to Chicago to respond – whether Hossa plays in Game 4 or not.

* History, apparently, is also against the Blackhawks at this point. Since the Final went to a seven-game format in 1939, teams that won Game 3 after splitting the first two contests have won the Cup 21 of 25 times. The Tampa Bay Lightning in 2004 was the last team to drop Game 3 in that scenario and win the Cup.


***

### Injury Report:

* Boston's Gregory Campbell (leg fracture) is out for the rest of the postseason, while Nathan Horton is playing through an upper-body injury that knocked him out of Game 1 in overtime.

* Marian Hossa is being called ""day-to-day"" for the Blackhawks and Quenneville said on Tuesday that he's ""likely"" to play in Game 4.

### Game Notes:

* The Chicago Blackhawks knew they couldn't afford to fall behind 3-1 in this series heading into Wednesday night's Game 4 at TD Garden and made sure it didn't happen. The Blackhawks found another level to outlast the Boston Bruins 6-5 in yet another overtime classic -- the third OT game of the series -- that evened things again at two games apiece.

* Next up in this Stanley Cup Final is a critical Game 5 at United Center on Saturday (8 p.m. ET), exactly one week after the Bruins stole an overtime victory in the same building to even the series at 1-1. After needing overtime to decide four of their past five playoff games, the Blackhawks gladly took the two-day break between games and look to repeat what they did in 2010 against the Philadelphia Flyers.

* Chicago dominated Game 5 that year to go up 3-2 in the and then polished it off with Patrick Kane's overtime goal in Philadelphia to clinch the franchise's first Stanley Cup title since 1961. If the Blackhawks can mirror that effort this time, it'll be their second title in four seasons with a core group of stars that's still in their prime. Conversely, if the Bruins can swipe another road victory they'll head home for Game 6 with a chance to clinch their second Cup title in three seasons.

### Injury Report:

* Boston forward Gregory Campbell (leg fracture) is out for the rest of the postseason. Forward Nathan Horton is playing through an upper-body injury.

I'm just curious why at times the refs will send some players off for minimal movement, and leave some to face off when they seem to be getting aggressive. I'm unclear as to what's allowed before a faceoff, and specifically why they get sent off for another player. 

Thanks!

I kinda am on the fence as to whether or not the Cooke hit deserved a major. Was it more his history that got him booted?

- **Expansion teams sign free agents:** 
Although there are many *decent* free agents available, you would certainly not be able to draw enough fan support having a team consisting of Scott Gomez and Hal Gill. Expanding one team from free agents seems non-logical, let alone two teams that will ride the bottom seed for many many years. If you read [this](http://www.thehockeynews.com/articles/52950-NHL-ripe-for-expansion-to-32-teams.html) article, the teams are built around washed-up veterans that IMO wouldn't do well.

- **Expansion Draft:** From my understanding, teams would be able to protect a certain number of players. No where could I find the amount of players though. Nor could I find if prospects would be protected. This option seems to benefit the expansion teams more, but could really hurt some power teams when trying to decide who to keep (prospects vs. 3rd liners). **EX:** A team like Boston is built off all 4 of their 4 lines, so it would really hurt their team structure trying to hand-pick the players that mean the most to them. However, if you place Malkin and Crosby on any team they're bound to make a playoff run. "	t5_2qrrq	True

### Game Notes:

* It has taken three calendar years and four NHL seasons for the Chicago Blackhawks to work their way back to this point. The Blackhawks also led the 2010 Stanley Cup Final 3-2 after five games before wrapping up the franchise's first NHL championship in 49 years by beating the host Philadelphia Flyers in overtime of Game 6.

* This time, Game 6 will be held on Monday (8 p.m. ET) in a different location (TD Garden), but the Blackhawks again find themselves feeling good with two cracks at winning the Stanley Cup - a potential Game 7, if necessary, would be at United Center on Wednesday night.

* Patrick Kane, who clinched that 2010 title with the OT goal, scored twice on Saturday night to in Chicago's 3-1 Game 5 victory at United Center, and the Windy City is all puffed up with anticipation about another possible Stanley Cup celebration.

* There's just one problem, and it's a big one. The Boston Bruins are no strangers to getting off the mat to steal a series in the Stanley Cup Playoffs and they're focused on doing it again to the Blackhawks - with or without injured star center Patrice Bergeron, who was taken by ambulance to a Chicago hospital during Game 5 for observation and diagnosis.

* Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews also got hurt in the game and spent the entire third period sitting on the bench, which adds even more intrigue to an already memorable Cup Final series.

***

### Injury Report:

* In addition to Bergeron's injury, Boston forward Gregory Campbell (broken leg) is out for the rest of the postseason and right wing Nathan Horton is playing through an upper-body injury.

* The Blackhawks expect that Hossa and Toews will be ready to go.
