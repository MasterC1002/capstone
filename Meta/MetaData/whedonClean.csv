Erawk	126	4	34	Besides, the movie is awesome and worth it.  I saw it last week in Boulder and it really is a perfect mix of horror and comedy.  I am actually taking two friends of mine to see it tomorrow and will try to convince anyone else to go as well.  If you don't like horror, go to the theater, buy a ticket and sneak into the Hunger Games or something.  If the movie does well movie studios will be more inclined to greenlight more original Whedon works for the big screen, which is a win for everyone.	t5_2qnnu	True

1338664290.0	uhief	Transcript of Joss Whedon's speech at the Equality Now 20th Anniversary Event on the nature of change.	UpvoteThisThrowaway2	48	3	2	"“Good evening. I would like to address the nature of change. There are two constants in the universe: existence and change. Neither of them ever stops. By the time I finish this sentence, the earth will be several thousand miles from where it was when I began it. And my phone will somehow, yet again, be obsolete.

As a society we resist change. I respect that. I liked my phone. We liked things the way they were. But then they very seldom ever actually were the way they were… and we didn’t actually like them that much then. What we mean by that is the way they’re ‘supposed to be’. According to our own ideological comfort zone. Our pin in time’s butterfly that sticks it to this spot, on this wall, in this frame. Everything concentrically that is farther away from this is ‘what’s wrong with the world’.

Religion is a pinpoint. This is not to belittle it, but the great religious texts (the Bible, Qu’oran, Martin Luther’s 95 theses): they were meant to affect radical change. To civilize, to reboot a world that seemed out of joint, seemed mad. And they did. Moving concentrically away through time they become less radical. They become staid, they become an excuse; a reason to ignore change, to fight it, to persecute. Not the fault of the text. This is how we work. We work like this because people think of themselves as separate from change in the way that we are separate from each other. We are blades of grass in an enormous field. The wind blows us this way or that way but it doesn’t affect the field.

When I graduated, amazingly, from university, our illustrious graduation speaker told us “Don’t try to change the world, you won’t, you can’t. The only thing you should try to do is not live off your parents.” I knew even then, he was wrong, he was cynical. I knew that I would find one day, a way… to live off my parents. And then, you know, hopefully get to the change thing. 

For some of us, this point, this pinpoint, is not what we were. It’s up ahead, it’s what we dream of being. Everybody in this room is in that category. Everybody here sees the next great text being written. Wants us to take the next step in the evolution of the human mind. Women and men as equals. Everybody in the world treated with respect. We’re not close. Equality Now works twenty years, more to come, to move us closer. Advocacy, participation, donation, even just listening moves us closer. Everyone here might well think of themselves as an agent of change. I’ll say to you all, from the bottom of my heart: you’re missing the point. You are not agents of change. You are change. It’s not a question of whether you can change the world: you have no choice. There is no world but what we see, no history but a compendium of perspectives. How you see the world will be the world or will become the world. If we see it with fear and hate… Fear and hate will manifest. If we look beyond, if we dream the next text, it will be written. We do not pass through this life, it passes through us. You are not just existing: you are happening, you are an event. You are changing everything.

And that may seem like a bit of a responsibility. “I’m history now? I was gonna have waffles, what does that mean!? How does that affect the timeframe continuum which I’m apparently in charge of?” I can’t help you with that. I would just say that you should understand your power and glory in your place in the chain. That’s where we are. We are standing in a line. Change will inevitably come and we will inevitably be a part of it and we will pass it on to those after us. You are not blades of grass in an enormous field. I cannot thank you all enough for being here, I would just ask that you remember long after this event is over, what all of us really are.”"	t5_2qnnu	True

&gt;From the badges of British cars to the Germanic operas of Richard Wagner, from the Hollywood epics of the 1950s to the personal history of Anya, the ex-vengeance demon in *Buffy the Vampire-Slayer*, the image of the Viking and his love of freedom, individualism and predisposition toward violence have become an integral part of Western conciousness and culture.

I am currently doing research for my Master's Thesis, specifically on the success (or lack thereof) of transmedia pop culture products. I am using Buffy as my primary case study, seeing as it has had a long ""afterlife"", so to speak, moving from film to TV series to the Angel spin-off, to comics, video games, books, fanfiction, etc. I will also have shorter sections on Firefly/Serenity, Dr. Horrible (Whedon's foray into the new medium of the blog), and hopefully Much Ado and Avengers as examples of his ability to adapt the stories of others to new media.

I would be extremely grateful if you would take a few minutes of your time to fill out this survey for me about your experiences with Buffy productions, specifically. If you could forward it on to others (fans as well as people still in the dark) too, that would be fantastic! It isn't too long; there is one question where I ask you to supply as best you can purchase prices/dates that might take a little bit more thought and time (and would also be extremely helpful for my research), but the rest are fairly simple and straightforward.

Depending on how this survey goes, I may create another applying to Whedon's works more generally, but for now I'm focusing on Buffy.

Anyway, [here's the link](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/HMVSCCH). If you have any questions or suggestions for changing up the survey, let me know here or PM me!"	t5_2qnnu	True

  &gt;Season One, Epitaph One, Season Two, Epitaph Two    

Currently I'm doing a series rewatch with my roommate, but she has never seen it before. Would you recommend watching in the same order, or alternately going:

Angel's villains are more down-to-earth, more visceral. They're stalkers and murderers and seductive monsters that eat your organs and thieving capitalists. They do actual Bad Things to real people, and getting rid of them actually saves people's lives.

I watched Serenity before Firefly, so the deaths of Wash and Book weren't a huge deal to me at the time.

Neither were the deaths of Anya, Spike or Wesley, in the Buffy and Angel Finales. I figured that someone would die, and at that point the stories were done. Anya was one of my favorite characters, but whether she died or didn't that was the end of the character (Ignoring the comics - it would be nice to see her there...)

Cordelia, on the other hand, I think was sorely missed from the Angel cast. But she was gone way before she died. 

So, really, it comes down to two for me. Joyce, obviously. But also Miss Calender, in the second season of Buffy. I feel like there were so many aspects of her character that had potential, especially in relation to Giles. 

So what does everyone else think?

CharlieReynolds	18	1	39	"... and maybe it's because I was anticipating it, due to the very spoiler-y DVD cover, but while I liked the season more than any since season 2 (or possibly 3), I was quite disappointed that Willow turned evil so late in the season, and was only evil for a grand total of 3 episodes.

Maybe they were trying to differentiate it from the Angelus arc that saw Angel turn evil for about 11 or 12 episodes in season 2, but I thought evil-Willow was the best villain the show had seen since the Mayor.

I was also a little disappointed that she so quickly went to the ""I'm gonna destroy the world"" thing.  This seems to be a problem with most series as they go on - every season has to have a ""bigger, higher stakes"" finale (see recent seasons of *Doctor Who*).

Anyway, I was wondering how others felt about the evil Willow arc, and season 6 in general, as I hear that many feel it's the weakest season (with the possible exception of 4), while I felt it was the strongest in a while.

...is the choice to switch Conrad to being a female character.

No reason the character couldn't've been female, of course. In fact, the character has so little personality that nearly any change could've been made without clashing.

But it really looks as if the only reason was to insert an unspoken romance (or at least sexual involvement) between Conrad and Don John. Which is also fine, but why was a gender swap necessary for that?

It seems all the more strange in light of the fact that Sean Maher, the actor who played Don John, is in fact gay. So it would actually have been _less_ of a stretch to have the romance be gay than straight. (Maher seemed to have difficulty forcing himself to caress even her shoulder, much less her anything else. I adore him as an actor, but depicting passion for a woman does not appear to be in his repertoire.)

The only reason I can imagine would be wanting to avoid the baggage that the two gay characters in the play just happen to also be the villains, and indeed the ones working hard to sabotage a straight marriage. But that seems a little simplistic an interpretation to worry about, doesn't it?

(SPOILERS, obviously)	BKred09	26	9	27	"I loved the movie and look forward to buying the DVD when it comes out.  I thoroughly enjoyed all the little jokes and references, from the totally unnecessary jump moment with the title card and ""I learned it from you"" joke and at the beginning and the credits billing of the puzzle-summoned demon as ""Fornicus, Lord of Bondage and Pain.""  For a movie that sought to deconstruct the horror movie genre, though, there are a few things that bothered me about the plot...

* I may have missed the exact line, but it sounded like the marijuana that Marty was using that the facility had planted made him completely immune to their other gasses.  I thought this was a really lame and unbelievable error.  It would seem that the point would be to make him *more* susceptible to their chemicals, but instead the department screwed up so badly they made him *completely* immune?    That's a bit [far-fetched](http://guides.ign.com/guides/16708/page_45.html).  
* Also on the subject of Marty, how did the facility make the mistake of thinking he was dead?  We clearly saw that they could track the kids' vital signs, so how did that system screw up?  I guess this could just be related to my previous point, but that just seems all the more convenient.
* My biggest complaint was the system purge, however.  It seemed like a total deus ex machina.  First of all, why does such a system exist?  What possible need could there be for a system purge like that?  And why is it such a convenient literal Big Red Button?  And, even allowing for those two points, why on **EARTH** would the system purge *into* the facility??  The whole climax, while totally bad-ass to be sure, feels completely contrived and really hurt the movie's ability to be a thoughtful deconstruction of the horror genre.

Anyway, those are just my thoughts.  I'm happy to see an original plot come out of Hollywood and I will be recommending the movie to friends, but those items have been bugging me about it in the hours since watching."	t5_2qnnu	True

The concept is simple, Buffy, Dollhouse, Firefly, Doctor Horrible, and all other Whedon creations are part of a single universe. Really this only impacts on Dollhouse and Firefly. The idea being that Dollhouse's grim future leads to the world of Firefly, with the rest just being stories that happen to fall in the universe.

It seems like one day Spike suddenly had a dream about making out with Buffy, and after that he became obsessed, and then in love, with her.  

Can you think of any **scenes or dialogue between the two that explain this?**  

To be clear, I'm not saying Spike loving Buffy doesn't make sense.  There are several reasonable theories, such as:

* Spike is obsessed with Slayers in general.  And after the chip, his obsession turns to love.
* Spike probably knows more about Slayers than anyone else besides the Watchers.  Deep down inside, he respects them and is drawn to the destructive nature of Slayers.
* Spike always wanted to be like Angel.
* Spike is a poet and is in love with the idea of the unattainable love (first Drew, then Buffy).  
* Spike thinks of himself as a hero in his own epic.  He loves dramatic gestures like hunting Slayers and devoting his life to one woman.  After Drew left, he turned all that focus to Buffy.  What is more epic than a vamp dating the slayer?
* Spike was abused by his mother, and in turn sort of like being abused by his women.
* The Scooby gang reminds him of the old ""family"" he had with Angel, Drew, and Darla, except the Scoobies are 1000% times better.

As I begin the final approach of my first Buffy &amp; Angel watch (just about to watch the last two episodes of season 4 of Angel and season 7 of Buffy), I should start asking about the canon comics.

According to wikipedia, the canon comics consist of:

* Buffy Season 8
* Buffy Season 9
* Angel: After the Fall
* Spike: After the Fall
* Fray
* Tales of the Vampires
* Tales of the Slayers

I know Angel &amp; Faith is supposed to be canon too. I figure Fray and the two Tales trades can be read at any point. But what about the rest of them?

Should any of season 8 be read alongside Angel Season 5? Or should all of ""After the Fall"" (Spike included) be read before starting season 8?
Season 9 is probably read alongside Angel &amp; Faith but I have a while before I get there.

I googled for some reading lists but a lot of them like to include non-canon stuff so it's a bit muddy as to where to start and when to start with respect to the TV series. I'm sure I wouldn't lose much by waiting till after Angel 5 to do any reading, but what do you guys think?

I remember watching *The Gift* with my Mom (who also was a Buffy fan) and running upstairs after the credits rolled so that I could cry my eyes out. 

I had no idea the show was coming back for Season 6, so for all I knew, that was the end of the show. I'm a big fan of Season 5, admittedly (I love Glory), but I think the show could've been better off ending there.

Sure, there are some great moments in Season 6 and 7, but, in my opinion, there's a big difference in quality. I don't really like where the story ended with Season 7 or the path it took to get there. 

Willow was always my favorite character (aside from B herself), and it's just hard to watch her in Season 6 and 7. I don't really like the Potential Slayers, for the most part (Vi and Amanda are the notable exceptions). 

*The Gift* would've been such a great ending for the show and the character herself. 

Granted, I feel Season 8 redeemed a lot of my story/character complaints that developed in Season 6 &amp; 7, so I suppose it worked out for the better in the end.

Still, there's a part of me that will always feel like *The Gift* is the real ending.

*Captatio Benevolentia* (sort of): this is a translation (from spanish) of a blog post adapted from the first draft of a paper that I hope to write some day. Because of this, I’m sure you’ll find some abominations of grammar, vocabulary and style. Please feel free to (nicely) point them out.

 
**1.Introduction**

Joss Whedon’s tv show Firefly and its film sequel Serenity show some explicit references to characters from William Shakespeare’s The Tempest. Specifically, both Miranda and Ariel are names of planets, while Caliban is mentioned in complementary material as the moon of Miranda. All of this celestial bodies exist in a planetary system known as the ‘Verse, a neologism, short for “universe” that also happens to be on apostrophe away from “verse”. One last possible reference to consider is the name of the spaceship in which most of the plot develops and which gives its name to the film: Serenity. An antonym of Tempest. (In spanish, “la mar serena”, “the serene sea” is a common expression, I‘m not sure if there‘s a similar one in English).

From this references, I suggest an analysis of Firefly and Serenity as readings of The Tempest. This is not to say that they are a re-writing of the play and that every character or event in it has an specific parallel in the show, but that I consider that there are two levels in Whedon’s work (the social/interplanetary one, and the crew one) in which the interactions and behaviors match certain characters of The Tempest.

**2. Magic and Science**

Serenity begins with the narration of the exile of humanity from an Earth that could no longer support them. The abusive industrial and technological development is shown as the cause of the banishment, but at the same time as the solution to it: this technology is what allows mankind to survive in a new planetary system. Various parallels with Prospero’s narration of his own exile are present: the excess in his studies (specially of his magic books) is what allows his brother to take power, but at the same time it’s thanks to this books that Prospero not only manages to survive in the island, but also effectively takes possesion of it
	
A key aspect of the colonization of the ‘verse, introduced in the very beginning of the series, is the terraforming process. This process consists in alterating the very atmosphere of hostile planets and moons to make them inhabitable. This control of the elements to mold them to human wishes or necesities, from our perspective, is unavoidably related to the use Prospero makes of his powers.

**3. Politics: paternalism and power**

We leave now the magic and scientific aspects of this relationship to get into the political aspect. The Alliance, a faceless government whose formal characteristics are never detailed, is shown as some sort of totalitarian/corporate regime, for lack of a better term. However, the narrating voice at the beginning of Serenity belongs to a teacher of high class children, who describes the Alliance in a positive way, emphasizing mainly it’s role of fatherly wise-leader of a society that needs it as a guide. This image can be easily compared to the one Prospero proposes of himself in the narration of his exile, and whoever accepts this parallelism will be forced to consider the connection between the Alliance’s despotic and machiavellic attitude with Prospero’s.
	
The ‘verse is fragmented in to zones: central planets and rim planets. There’s a great difference in the economic condition between both zones, which at some point provoked a war between the Alliance and independents. When the teacher at the beginning of Serenity is questioned about the Alliance’s necessity to “tell people what to think” she answers with the Alliance’s sinister position in a warm, motherly tone: not what to think, *how* to think.

The parallelism between the Alliance’s powers and Prospero’s comes up again, this time not in the shape of the control of nature, but of people. There’s an ambition to control other wills, an element that we will expand on later on.

Besides the Alliance and the independents, there’s a last group to consider: *reavers*. This men are sadists, cannibals and rapists whose origins are shrouded in mystery, and that work as a chaos element. Reavers give the alliance a way to explain their dominion over rim planets: only they can provide defenses against this “monsters”.

If we think of the Alliance as a reading of a Prospero as a tyrant, then it would make sense to consider what places this groups it interacts with occupy. The general population, that the Alliance wishes to control completely in a fatherly fashion, can be seen as a possible interpretation of Miranda, or even more widely or characters in the island. The independents, the share of the population against the established order, are shown as Caliban: rebels against a system that intends to civilize them.

Finally, the reavers, the chaos element, are more complex. On one side, they could be interpreted as another possible version of Caliban: violent, uncontrollable, but ultimately functional to the system. However, they could also be seen as a version of Ariel in that their actions serve an ultimate goal (controlling the rim planets) while independents endanger that goal. There are more aspects to consider about reavers, but before getting into that we need to direct our analysis to the leavel of the main characters, that is, the crew of Serenity.

**4. The crew level**

The main character of Firefly is Malcolm Reynolds, a veteran independent who is now a cargo ship captain. Curiously, despite his strong anti-authoritarian political posture, he assumes his leader role in an almost despotic way, while at the same time showing a determination to protect his subordinates at any cost. This authoritarian yet paternalist attitude reflect the previously analyzed attitudes of the Alliance and Prospero.
	
Malcolms figure as ship captain is at the same time analogous to the one in Shakespeares play, using the motif of the analogy between vessel and State. In this way, Malcolm works, ironically, as a synecdoche of the Alliance.
	
From this notion of Malcolm as the “Prospero” of the crew, we proceed to analyze his relationship with two characters: Jayne Cobb and Simon Tam
	
Jayne is an stereotypical thug. Violent, lascivious, sadistic, barely alphabetized, he shows more than once that his loyalty is based on money and one time, during Malcolms absence, he attempts to take control of the ship trough violence, saying that the chain of command is “the chain I hit you with till you give me command” (this is a translation to English from a translation to Spanish, so its probably not the literal quote). His relationship with the captain is, of course, tense. The one time Jayne attempts to betray the crew, Malcolm finds out and threatens to kill him. There is no need to make a huge leap to see the similarities between this relationship and the one between Prospero and Caliban: the subordinate is unhappy with his situation and tries to rebel, just to be exposed and punished.
	
Simon Tam, the ships doctor, is as far from Cobb as it gets. He was raised in central planets, he is fancy, polite, maybe even effeminate. While he has brushes with the captain, he is mostly submissive, if not because of his weak personality, then because of his physical inferiority. Unlike Jayne, whose job is purely physical, Simon has an academic education, and his work requires finesse and intelligence. He is similar to Ariel in that he is shown distanced from the material plane and close to the mental or spiritual plane (Ariel trough magic, Simon trough science).
	
The last character I will analyze is River Tam, Simons sister. She is a young gifted teenager with latent psychic abilities who’s been used by the alliance in experiment, resulting in madness that shows itself in various ways, including childish, violent or simply chaotic behavior. The purpose of the experiments was to attempt to control Rivers mind, to supress her will. Besides age and sex, River shares with Miranda this disturbing situation: that figure that is supposed to protect her isolates her and attempts to control her, resulting in a young woman with no place in society.
	
Simon escapes with River from the Alliance and, fugitives, find shelter in Malcolms ship. Once the captain takes them in as part of his crew, River is adopted by the rest of the characters, who are mostly protective of her. The only exception is Jayne, the “Caliban” of the crew, who mostly reject the idea of traveling with River. This will create tension in the group more than one time, but the most relevant time is the one to be analyzed now.

**5.Ariel**
	
In the episode titled Ariel, the crew visits the planet with this name, a central planet. Ariel is beautiful, full of light, a place where people live with no worries. Like its homonymous, Ariel is functional to its master, who treats it kindly. During this visit, a key event takes place: Jayne attempts to betray the crew, specifically, he tries to sell the Tams to the authorities. This plan fails, as once they get their prisoners the Alliance attempts to get rid of him. Once the situation is solved, Jayne has to face his captain, a situation I’ve already analyzed.
	
While Jayne is shown as the “Caliban” of the show, his behavior here is actually similar to Ariels. Jayne attempts to make a deal with a system whose only purpose is to control people so that they won’t behave like he does - criminally. Similarly, Simon, favored by the government thanks to being born in a wealthy family, rebels against the system that gave him access to education, just like Caliban rebels against his master, the one who taught him how to read. While Jayne and Simon represent Caliban and Ariel respectively in the crew level, their roles are reversed in the social/political level.

It starts off very weak but it gets much better. It is a great concept that they didn't always execute well but when they pulled it off they pulled it off in a big way. Whiskey at the end of the S1 finale is one of my favorite Whedon scenes now and Belonging is one of my favorite episodes. 

What I didn't like? The supporting cast was criminally underused(Topher and Sierra specifically, imo). It was kind of disappointing how little screentime they got while Echo was getting a ton of time for a ""Doll of the Week"" story. Or, god forbid, more Paul Ballard(for me he was like the Riley of Dollhouse). "	t5_2qnnu	True

I bought this AWESOME t-shirt with Serenity on it on Dec 10, because it was really cool and I knew my boyfriend would love it. He got me into Firefly, and we're both superfans now! 

So...The confirmation email said ""allow additional 5-7 business days for printing etc"". I didn't get any shipping emails, but I got charged (paid via paypal). 

I tried to contact them several times when I didn't get any shipping info, but they haven't responded and don't have a phone number. I've checked my order status, but it still says it's ""new order"". It's now Dec 21st, and I still haven't gotten any emails! I wanted it for Christmas, but I don't think that'll happen now...

Did anyone else purchase this shirt and have a similar experience? Does TeeFury do this often? I'm considering trying to cancel my order by PayPal... advice? Thanks :)

Costume:

T-shirt from [here](http://drhorrible.shop.bravadousa.com/Product.aspx?cp=15324_15784&amp;pc=BGCTDH33&amp;src=BASE1894), I'm going to attempt to fade it closer to the gray Captain hammer wears using a mild bleach solution. I have a cheap black t-shirt I'm going to attempt that with first.

Gray cargo pants from a local Old Navy, just hope I can find some with a 36"" inseam.

Already own a black belt.

Can't afford combat boots, but I've got an old pair of hiking boots I can spraypaint black.

I've also got a beard that I'm very reluctant to shave, but I'm afraid I may have to.

Anyone have any other advice or suggestions? I'm not particularly skilled at sewing or altering clothing, but any tips are well appreciated.

**Update:**

Thanks for all the suggestions. I'm gonna keep this short 'cause I don't feel particularly good right now.

* I ended up buying iron on paper because the shipping on the shirt to get it here on time was another $22

* For the gloves I ended up getting large cuffed work gloves from a dollar store. I also got some foam sheeting from a craft store to extend the cuffs. Total, $1.82.

* I've decided that I am going to shave to do the costume justice (you know, the other name of justice), but I'm not going to do so until Saturday night, if you want I can post a picture of the completed get up then.

* Spray painting in a dorm room is really gorram stupid. Don't do it."	t5_2qnnu	True

The whole show, IMO, is about the fight for the moral. And pointing out that part of being human is being immoral, and yet we should still fight for the moral side, it's just amazing.

Then I looked him up and I was surprised to see that he was born in New Jersey and only moved to England after high school.  Does anyone else find his American accent kind of funny and not authentic?  Even now as he plays Sandy Rivers on How I Met Your Mother I still think his American accent isn't natural. 

I read on Wikipedia (the source of all true knowledge) that he suffered and recovered from Bells Palsy and I wonder if that has anything to do with it.   What do you guys think?

I remember the second half of the second season being ridiculously good, but are there any episodes that are completely skip-able?

Back in Season 2, Buffy dies bringing about a new line of Slayers (Kendra -&gt; Faith).

Every time a Slayer dies, a new one is activated. So when Buffy dies in the Season 5 finale, why is there not a 3rd Slayer?

The Slayer Prophecy is rather unhelpful:

&gt;Into every generation she is born: one girl in all the world, a chosen one. She alone will wield the strength and skill to fight the vampires, demons, and the forces of darkness; to stop the spread of their evil and the swell of their number. She is the Slayer. 

It doesn't even mention what happens when the Slayer dies... in fact it seems to indicate that there should be a new slayer every 20 years or so (new generation), not every time the old one dies...

Has this ever been addressed? I'm about to start reading Buffy Season 8, but given the end of 7, it seems like a bit of a moot point.

Given that the Watcher's Council employs Giles, Wesley and other guardians of the Slayer, wouldn't it make sense for them to simply employ Buffy as well?

But I think the problem has more to do with the general decline in quality from seasons 3 to 4 as Joss Whedon became less involved. Few of the new characters were even interesting, and some of the plots seemed forced. For example, the writers didn't seem to know what to do with Spike for awhile.

Did people enjoy the false story, or hate that it was a ""waste of their time""?

EDIT: As of this writing, all the comments are positive. I really enjoyed it too, especially the way Whedon set us up for a happy ending and then turned it on its head (as he is wont to do). Plus, it set up ""Soulless"", one of my favorite Angel episodes of all time."	t5_2qnnu	True

* Buffy: most of the characters change throughout the series, ass-kicking female protagonist, and most seasons had a good story arc. Also, I love Andrew. I wish he would've been in more of the show, pretty much everything he said made me laugh.

* Dollhouse: I felt almost all of the actors in this show were fantastic and that's why Eliza Dushku and Tahmoh Penikett's meh acting seemed so flat. Enver Gjoka was an amazing actor, I wish he was in more shows. Plus, I loved the story line and felt like there could've been a lot more to tell if it hadn't been canceled.

* Firefly: I really have no cons about this show. There were no weak characters, no weak episodes, and it told the story that it needed to in a one season and a movie. The only reason it's third for me is because I'm not as enthusiastic about space shows, but I like them enough.

* Angel: Don't get me wrong, I like Angel. Season five is one of my favorite Whedon seasons and I absolutely love Fred. However, pretty much all of season four was hard to get through for me. I loathed the Connor storyline, I loathed what they did to Cordelia, and I loathed the Angel/Cordelia romance."	t5_2qnnu	True

Wow. I couldn't even get through the whole episode. The woman who played the famous actress, Rebecca, was UNBEARABLE. She had nothing really significant to say. She just swept into rooms with her skeleton figure and gave that slack jawed, ""oh-woe-is-me"" look. What I especially couldn't stand it the fact that they made Angel ""into"" her.

And while, yes, there were ups and downs throughout its run, it remained remarkably consistent - there was never a point where I said, ""Oh, fuck it, I give up,"" the way I did with ""The X-Files,"" ""24"" and ""House.""

Season 7 was probably the second-weakest season overall, IMO, but the finale was absolutely perfect.  Given Joss's track record, I expected more deaths for more prominent characters, but I'm almost glad to be proven wrong.

I *am* a bit disappointed that I know Spike will be returning, given his appearance on the cover of *Angel* Season 5, but that doesn't bother me 'cause Spike is awesome.

And, since I might as well, here's my ranking of all 7 seasons, from my favorite to my least-favorite:

1. Season 2
2. Season 6
3. Season 3
4. Season 5
5. Season 1
6. Season 7

It was a ridiculously difficult list to make, but ever since I've been curious to hear other people's opinions...

(And I'm sure not everyone on here has seen every Whedon show, but feel free to make your own list with just the shows you've seen. I'm really just curious to see what everyone's favorites are.)

So here's mine, in no particular order:

* Jaynestown - Firefly
* Getting Closer - Dollhouse (the episode that made the entire show worth it for me.)
* Spin the Bottle - Angel 
* Graduation - Buffy (possibly my favorite season finale of any show ever. PERFECTION.)
* Once More, With Feeling - Buffy (singing!)
* The Body - Buffy
* A Hole in the World - Angel (you might be able to tell I'm a sucker for the sad ones...)
* War Stories - Firefly (this is the episode that really cemented Firefly as a great show for me)
* Waiting In The Wings - Angel
* Hush - Buffy 

And an honorable mention goes to Dr. Horrible...it's not really an *episode* so I felt odd putting it on the list, but it definitely needs recognition.

Other honorable mentions: Tabula Rasa (Buffy), Smile Time (Angel), Our Mrs. Reynolds (Firefly), Shindig (Firefly), I Will Remember You (Angel), every Pyela episode in Angel, The Prom (Buffy), Band Candy (Buffy)...and more!

1317075006.0	ks9l8	TIL that Joss Whedon originally planned for Dollhouse to be a full 5-season story arc. I thought up this speculative schedule for what could have been. Discuss.	seamusocoffey	2	1	0	"Season 1) As original, story arc of Alpha breaking back in
(Epitaph I)

Season 2) Story arc of Senator Perrin, senate investigation (current episodes 2-5, 2-6) 

Season 3) Another season with Alpha involved, possibly A Love Supreme (2-8) extended, possibly something else. Perhaps when he turns good, as seen in Epitaph II
(Epitaph II)

Season 4) Story arc ending with Caroline coming back and exploding Rossum HQ in Tuscon (current season 2 finale)

Season 5) First half would be normal, then the world goes to crap, and the second half would be Epitaphs III-VII or something.

Dollhouse was actually the lowest-rated show on FOX ever to get renewed. I suppose FOX decided that since it was a Whedon show, and they cancelled Firefly, they owed him one, and renewed it. But I am guessing that Whedon saw the end coming and compacted it all, because the ending seemed very rushed. 

Remember, this is just my speculation, not fact."	t5_2qnnu	True
1309364557.0	icewf	I just finished reading all of Angel's run with IDW. What does everyone think?	_Teryx_	2	1	1	"Over the past week or so, I've read all of the Angel and Angel-affiliated comics IDW put out, in what I'm pretty sure is as close to chronological order as it gets.

I liked a lot of what they did, especially with the *After the Fall* stuff, but it seems like they had a lot of problems keeping a cohesive flow to the story.  What the hell was with James?  And Illyria at the end of *Haunted*?  And Eddie Hope?  So many unanswered questions - some I don't much care about, but others I'd love to revisit.

Do you guys think any of this stuff will actually matter once Season 9/Angel &amp; Faith roll around?  I know the canonicity of everything that isn't *After the Fall* and the *Spike* mini-series is dubious at best, just wondering if anyone else has any thoughts or would like to discuss the occasionally messy run of Angel and crew at IDW

As for Buffy, I read Season 8 piecemeal as it came out, but honestly, it's all sort of a blur, so I'm planning on doing the same thing I did with IDW's Angel and just read Season 8 straight through again, try and get a grasp on what happened."	t5_2qnnu	True
