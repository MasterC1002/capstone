1334106967.0	s3jwy	Everyone needs to play nice, House is a broad term. [please read]	NPC82	68	5	16	"I have noticed a trend on the boards lately. People are clashing on what House music is at certain times of the day and it's getting a bit ugly.


I am all about the more classical ""real house"" sound. Really now. Trust me. At the same time I believe that all types of House fans deserve this space to discuss music. That doesn't mean I want everyone to tolerate bad music. Understand there is a distinction there. **Use your ears, not your preconceived judgments, and don't flame each other if you don't like what you hear**.

That's right, even if you don't like something, [you don't have to be a dick about it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0la5DBtOVNI).


Specifically with sub-genres. People have invented sub-genres so they could pick and choose tunes they like while differentiating themselves from people they don't. This is ignorant ans stupid. The reason why I submit and moderate /r/house instead of something like /r/classichouse is becuase I want to share my taste and enthusiasm for House music to the most amount of House music fans possible. Others deserve that privilege as well. Let's teach *and* learn about music from each other, give *and* take knowledge.

 I believe it's time we stop breaking up everything and realize we all have the same goal at the end of the day: To dance, relax, and simply partake in musical flight.

Yeah yeah whats good is subjective. I'm sorry but its not. Bad music is bad music. End of. I'd say about one in 10 tracks here are House if even. Its a crying shame that the sub isn't put to better use, where it could be a place for people to discover great new music instead of wading through tripe to find one gem.

I have that page hidden to the public so let me know if there's any problem seeing the page or downloading the tracks.

I tried to record the ones I didn't think would be easy to find otherwise. Some of the track names might be off because the record wasn't labeled. I re-masterd them a little and tried to take out the big pops. But remember some of these are 20 year old and made out of acetate. That, and they had a lot of time on the decks.

enjoy :)

Save your downvotes for /r/ElectronicMusic, our community here is too small to afford losing posts because they don't match your narrow taste in House music.

Undapanda went a long way in disabling the downvote button in the custom theme for this subreddit to try and stop that from happening, but people will continue to be jerks regardless.

Launch party featuring /r/house DJs!	tom_riddler	31	5	8	"It's been almost a year since EDMradio launched as a place for redditor DJs to play the music they love online. Since then, we have established a warm and welcoming community on IRC, have hosted genre nights and have had plenty of DJs play some really great shows. But now we're taking things to the next level, and that is why we're renaming and rebranding as bside.fm.

The fact is, it became clear that we were not just about out EDM, but about any great music in general. We've had jazz, funk, soul, hip-hop, disco and anything else you could think of on the station up until now, and whilst we still definitely enjoy our electronic music, why would we decide to limit the amount of awesome music we can play?

If you're a listener, we're sure you'll find something that you'll enjoy; be it a great piece of music that you've never heard before - or just the comforting sounds of our excellent radio presenters voices as you sink in to your armchair.

We have music running all night brought to you by some of our station's more regular DJs and admins, so do join us and meet the crew in the live chat on the website.

###We have reached over 4000 subscribers!

We've finally gotten the [moderation problem](http://redd.it/pmud9) fixed thanks to your [support](http://redd.it/pyhri) in [HPPD2](http://redd.it/pn1mp) and [my own](http://redd.it/pyhm4) redditrequest threads!

I along with HPPD2 and NPC82 will be your new moderators, and we would like to direct your attention to the rules of the subreddit (which really haven't changed all that much). Check the sidebar for the full list.

---

Just as long as you're not spamming or way off topic, we won't do anything to your post. Don't expect us to be very strict either, we just threw in the relevancy clause in case the issue arises. For further reference, these rules will be in the sidebar.

You may have noticed that the subreddit's overall look is slightly different. Here's a rundown of what's been edited (many thanks to [onimonkii](http://www.reddit.com/user/kjoneslol) and [kjoneslol](http://www.reddit.com/user/kjoneslol) for helping me with the design and bug fixing):

* New banner and mouseover text. Clicking the Reddit alien or the ""reddit |"" text will bring you to your frontpage, while clicking ""HOUSE"" or the house music icons will bring you to [/r/house](/r/house) (thanks onimonkii!).

* Dropdown menus with useful links, copied from Raerth's guide and kjoneslol

* New sidebar, with basic posting rules, useful sites, and related subreddits.

* Restyled search bar and submit button, thanks to kjoneslol. The submit button has been moved up to above the sidebar.

* Footer image (new ideas are welcome for this).

* Downvote arrow hovertext (Please remember the reddiquette).

We would like your help in adding more content to the dropdown menus. Please leave your suggestions in the comments or shoot us a message on modmail.

---

One more thing I'd like to introduce, and that's the [/r/house](/r/house) IRC channel. Join us!

irc.freenode.net #reddit-house

If you have any more suggestions, ideas, or comments, feel free to let us know. We are always open to new ideas.

June is House Month, so I would really appreciate it if some knowledgeable r/house lovers could point me in the right direction regarding what to listen to, what to learn, what to read, what to see and do, how to think, and anything else which might be useful.

If you're interested, January was [Folk](http://www.reddit.com/r/folk/comments/obfcf/tell_me_everything_you_know_about_folk_music/), February was [Blues](http://www.reddit.com/r/blues/comments/p55qo/tell_me_everything_you_know_about_blues_music/), March was [Funk](http://www.reddit.com/r/funk//comments/qcvq7/tell_me_everything_you_know_about_funk_please/), April was [Reggae](http://www.reddit.com/r/reggae/comments/ro3df/tell_me_everything_you_know_about_reggae_please/), and May was [Dub](http://www.reddit.com/r/dub/comments/t1bwy/tell_me_everything_you_know_about_dub_please/).

I see you have info at the top and on the side, which I'll check out of course, but I do like to see the enthusiasm of the fans come through in the comments - gets me in the mood for learning.

Thanks in advance!

P.S: whoever designed this subreddit style has taste.

Edit: cheers for all the responses guys - I'm kind of on holiday at the moment so it'll be a few days before I can get properly stuck in, but this looks fucking great so far.

Please post some [sub]genre defining  content that would aid a new listener in developing an ear for house music. Post the stuff you wish everyone ought to have heard.

Those of you who have been around ''since the beginning''; take it as an opportunity to school your younger peers.

To everyone that posted songs/mixes in npa6600's thread:  Why didn't you submitted that awesome shit before? Don't hold out on us, share the music, man. Putting them in comment replies makes it hard to find. So in the future if you would like to reply with a song/mix post it in the reddit too.

If you have any suggestions on how to make the r/house experience any better, let me know .

1306926894.0	hozm0	I think /r/house should show some love to /r/disco.	NPC82	31	6	3	"Tonight I was winding down with some disco and I thought ""hey I know, I'll find /r/disco, assuming it exists, and post this track on there"" -- Just like I do with /r/house. It did exist luckily, but oh my god is it in a sad state:

http://www.reddit.com/r/disco




I find it highly ironic that /r/disco is dead meanwhile boards of obscure sub-genres and off-shoots of house take off. Considering all modern forms of dance music stem from disco one way or another I think we owe it some attention, some respect, a simple nod of acknowledgement if you will. 

Maybe this is a generational thing, maybe people are afraid to say they like disco over something like House or ""Funky house"". Perhaps even I'm just not looking at the right subreddit for disco? I don't know, but even Italo disco and nudisco have more posts in a shorter amount of time than /r/disco.

To drive my point home, I'll post a House track that samples the very disco track [I've posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/Disco/comments/hozgz/change_miracles/) in /r/disco. There's plenty more out there that sample it, and many many more house tracks that sample disco.

1365543624.0	1c0nwj	Facebook has been pretty good today... Nina vs. Plex	tommcg	25	3	8	"So for those of you that haven't kept up with it all.. After the fall out from [RA's](http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1765) 'Between the Beats' segment and Greg Wilson's responding [article](http://www.gregwilson.co.uk/2013/04/nina-kraviz-the-mistress-of-her-own-myth/) It seems Maceo Plex felt like having a much less graceful stab at Nina and her ""talent"". That post has since been deleted, but Nina's [response](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=620022344679361&amp;set=a.254445701237029.82440.192110944137172&amp;type=1) has his initial comments in quote marks... 

Now it seems a bunch of the house and techno world are jumping in behind Nina, with Radio Slave calling Plex (and anyone else giving her shit) ['idiots'](https://www.facebook.com/like.radio.slave/posts/294548197343739)

Cassy Britton seems to have rejected Plex's affection and sided with Nina [too](https://www.facebook.com/cassyofficial/posts/450275465050223).. 

And then of course there is [Robert Dietz](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151418080208878&amp;set=a.10151385207513878.1073741825.43133943877&amp;type=1) and TEED having some [fun](https://vine.co/v/bDB9MzWvp6I)... 

And lets not forget when [Seth Troxler](http://nfs.stvfiles.com/imagebase/163/623x349/163435-seth-troxler.jpg) got in a bath... 

The whole thing is actually pretty funny (and the comments, especially on Nina's page, are even more hilarious, between all the men vying for Nina's attention and the PLUR brigade, phwoar) but Nina, game, set and matching Plex into oblivion was one of the funniest things I've seen on FB in a while.. Girl can barely speak English and judo chopped him to fuck.. 

TL;DR: Nina got in a bath and talked some rubbish about being on tour, Plex didn't like it and made a dick of himself (well, a bigger dick than he already is anyway). 

The End, thanks for watching."	t5_2qkb5	True

...


It's something I've been wanting to do for awhile. I get a lot of these opportunities and a lot of stations flounder about or fall apart. Some of the previous DJs I put together have been too busy, or are burnt on the idea. Finally, I think some buddies have put together a product I can get on board with and sign up other DJs. So here we are! Can't say the station name yet but I like where it's going.

So why is '97 the cutoff? Because I've determined the ""Classic House"" demonym needs to be at least 15 years old. It's to keep things focused a bit, and to keep the old people feeling relevant. :)

1346362173.0	z3lbg	I had an opportunity to meet and talk to Junior Sanchez and I'd like to paraphrase his thoughts on the current state of house and the beef between Steve Angello and DJ Sneak.	djpaulross2	19	3	56	"I was at the In Booth gallery opening for Rukes at the W hotel Times Square NYC. I felt terribly out of place, but I ended up talking to a lot of industry people and I met a lot of up and coming DJs. I also spotted Junior (+funkagenda DJ'd! Got to stand over his shoulder and watch from behind the decks) and went up to him.  
I'm going to loosely paraphrase what he said when I asked him about the beef:  
&gt;The beef between Sneak and Steve is unfortunate. House can mean so many different things to so many different people. There's no sense in yelling at somebody and telling them they're doing it wrong and telling them what they should like. It doesn't matter if its big room, small room, club, real house, as long as people are dancing and coming together.  

At this point I came in and told him I was only 17 and getting into all of the ""real"" house artists (Sneak, Danny T, Sasha, Junior, Marshall Jefferson, Phuture ETC.) I also told him about some of my favorite mixes from Carl Cox and Danny T, which were recored before I was even born.  
&gt;That's really great, and as I've told Sneak, you have to let the younger kids really dig in and get into it, and not dictate their tastes. Some will dig deeper and their tastes will mature.  


I think this subreddit can learn from his words, and he changed my view, and there is no use in yelling at people who are just into the big room sound. Let's discuss it. "	t5_2qkb5	True

1369771299.0	1f7xa9	Hi /r/house, could I have any suggestions for a dissertation topic [long shot]	slimatk	15	3	27	"Hey all - Love this sub - long term contributor here!

I've been into house music for a few years now, It's come to the point whilst studying at University to begin my dissertation. 

I have been struggling the past few weeks to pick a topic, I have written down all my interests, one being house music and would love to touch on House music as a topic. 

I am studying a film degree which means I can submit my dissertation as a documentary. I plan on speaking to anyone and everyone involved in the house movement in general!

I just need to pinpoint my research into House music to give it some sort of direction.

If someone could suggest some things I would really appreciate that, I am more than happy to help in return. (promotions or alike)

I am from the UK.

I enjoy Deep House music, attending house events, promoting music, associated visual elements of house music (at events etc) and visit Ibiza, Germany and Amsterdam regularly following house wherever it takes me.

I know by this point in my studies I should be able to pick something myself but I am finding it rather difficult. 

Like I said, any help at all would be really appreciated!

If it's something you personally would like to find out about House music in general, I'd love to research it!

We'll probably keep them for now anyway. What are your thoughts? Do you like the change?

Also, I have a few ideas on how to engage and grow this subreddit but I thought I would reach out for YOUR ideas first. I'm looking for something everyone can participate in on a whim, maybe some sort of competition? By the way the podcast WILL come back for at least two or three more episodes down the line, mark my words.

We have grown incredibly in the recent past. Traffic has spiked, and I am no longer the only one submitting. So, welcome new subscribers, and thank you submitters, i no longer need to look very hard to find my groove.

There has also been a string of non-house posts which i have had to remove(some of them took a while, sorry). This is /r/House, one of hundreds ( thousands? ) of subreddits. There are also many musical reddits to suit your taste. Be aware of that when posting here.

However, your  post does not need to be strictly house, if you are unsure post anyway. Your fellow redditors and I will judge accordingly, we might enjoy it. Don't upvote because the DJ is from your town/poster is your alternate account/ and don't downvote  because you don't like a song (this does not apply to truly terrible songs =P) . For fuck's sake follow reddiquette.

Do your best to provide a direct link. If you report a link; provide a reason. If you are chicken PM me.

There have been self posts asking ""why does the music here suck"" about once a month for a while now, so I just wanted to say that today the sub is looking better! 

Mods, is the *Encouraged/Discouraged* section under Submission Rules new? I don't remember seeing that before. 

I've been sensing a vinyl and roots house revival lately and I think this sub's discussions are reflecting that. I was happy to go to the page today and see many releases pressed to vinyl and/or music more true to the house sound. 

Anyway, just wanted to keep up the positivity &amp; optimism that the love for the real house sound is still ringing even amongst the commercialization.
