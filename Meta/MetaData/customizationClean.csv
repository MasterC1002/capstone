First off, hello and welcome to /r/customization!
 
If you are absolutely new to theming and skinning, I would suggest you start somewhere easy. Personally, I would advise you to download [RocketDock](http://rocketdock.com/download). RocketDock is an easily customizable icon dock for your desktop. Get a feel on how to use it and try using different [docks](http://rocketdock.com/addons/skins/popular) and [icons](http://browse.deviantart.com/customization/icons/dock/).
 
After you have gotten familiar with RocketDock, you should also check out so called ""resource display software"". One of the more popular ones is called Rainmeter and can be found [here](http://rainmeter.net/cms/).
 
Download it and get familiar with the menus. Once you have checked it out a bit, head on over [here](http://browse.deviantart.com/customization/skins/sysmonitor/rainmeter/).
 
You will probably also want to change your start orb so it fits with your overall theme. To do this, you can use [this program](http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-7-start-button-changer-released). Various start orbs can be found [here](http://browse.deviantart.com/customization/skins/windows7/startorbs/).
 
Interested in more changes? You can use [CursorFX](http://www.stardock.com/products/cursorfx/) to change your cursor style.
 
You can also change folder and app icons like [so](http://www.lifehacker.com/5898507/how-to-customize-any-folder-or-app-icon-in-windows) (thanks [Kylde](http://www.reddit.com/r/customization/comments/rqb7z/how_to_customize_any_folder_or_app_icon_in_windows/))

A: Everything you need to know to get started can be found [here](http://rainmeter.net/cms/Rainmeter101-HowItWorks).
 
___
 
 
Q: Cool, but how do I use custom themes?
 
A: Download a theme, unzip it if needed an place it in:
 
(Xp) 	- C:\Documents and Settings\Your Name\My Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\
 
(Win7)	- C:\Users\Your Name\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins
 
Right-click on the raindrop that is located in your system tray and select ""configs"". That is where you can choose which skin is being used.
 
Note: You can only load one .ini file from a specific folder at once. If you want two skins to run simultaneously you will need to have each one in its own folder.
 
___
 
Q: Something isn't working....
 
A: Maybe you can find a solution [here](http://rainmeter.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=6036).

You have not only showcased a bunch of awesome looking setups that would put many companies to shame, but you have been really helpful while doing so. You have been extraordinarily  helpfull and have been an awesome community as a whole. Many thanks to everybody who have been patient enough to not only share, but explain their setups and who have been kind enough to include the sources. Besides that, you have also not been downvoting post you disagree with, but have actually been following rediquette and posting a reply instead (HUGE kudos here, keep up the awesome work). 
 
Next to all the approval I would like to remind you of something small: Any questions and/or thoughts are gladly listened to by me (if you think something should be changed and/or added to the sidebar, just say so)
 
Criticism will be read and acted towards in a fashionable way, yet the general direction of the subreddit has seemed exactly the way I had imagined it. I just wanted to thank you all.
 
tl;dr You guys rock and it is an honor to have created a subreddit where people actively help each other. If you have any questions and/or critique; do not hesitate to message me."	t5_2sfgt	True

I make tech tutorials, and work on various computer-related hobbies. I was brought here to help out and also show you guys the beautiful side of Linux. I am currently working on a more holistic guide to customizing Linux for you guys.


Some of my latest projects you may remember include: the Windows USB Music Studio on a Stick, Apple USB Music Studio on a Stick, as well as Jambuntu Linux, which was a xubuntu-fork I created for /r/edmproduction.


If you would like any help, or have any questions, feel free to ask.

Recently since the build of my new computer it had failed me, I searched in vain for a fix to the error I was seeing to no avail (all the images were ghosted so everything looked messy). In my search for a forum post anywhere about the problem I was having I ran across [this article](http://www.techairlines.com/2010/10/10/rocketdock-vs-objectdock-vs-nexus/) comparing rocktdock/objectdock/nexus. I had never heard of [Nexus](http://www.winstep.net/nexus.asp) before (come to find out its a part of winstep) so i gave it a shot. Now I'm loving it.

Examples would be monochromatic icon sets, start orb changer, docks and how to use them, themes and how to use them, etc.

**Edit:** I guess I should start. RocketDock  is a very common dock. It's very simple to use. Just download the file from http://rocketdock.com/ then start the program. Right click on the dock to bring up options for changing something about the dock location, appearance, behavior, programs attached, etc. I believe it is under preferences when right-clicking the dock. To change icons, you can download the images from either the RocketDock website or http://www.deviantart.com/  then extract the zipped file and put the images in the icon folder located in (C:)&gt;Program Files (x86)&gt;RocketDock then right click the icon on the dock you wish to change and follow the options.

For a start orb changer, try Windows 7 Start Orb Changer v5 http://kishan-bagaria.deviantart.com/art/Windows-7-Start-Orb-Changer-v5-153001999  Using this should be pretty straight forward. I haven't tried any .PNG images but the program developer claims they work. Just search for start orbs in deviantART and download the images (They will likely be .BMP). If you have problems with it try running as an administrator.

Those are just a couple to get us started. If someone could introduce Rainmeter or Samurize, maybe some dos and don'ts, some good starting themes, and how to customize it, it would be appreciated."	t5_2sfgt	True

2. OS: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit
3. CPU: AMD FX-4100 Zambezi 3.6GHz AM3+ 95W Quad-Core
4. GPU: 2x GeForce GTX 550 Ti SLI
5. Sound Card: See mobo
6. RAM: 4x 4gb G.SKILL Ripjaws Series 240-Pin DDR3 1600
7. Optical Drive: Blu-Ray Burner
8. Old HD: 1.5tb Western Dig 7200rpm
9. New SSD: Samsung 840 120GB SATA III

I've had this fairly modest rig for a couple years now, and it always bugged me that my Microsoft score was a 5.9 because of my HD being the weakest link in the chain. It has also been awhile since I've cleared up old programs or made a fresh backup. 

I've finally bought a new SSD in hopes of speeding up processing times, and raising that damn score (all my other components are rated in the 7s)! I plan on starting with a fresh install of Win7 and I have a couple goals. I find preparation is the best way to meet them, however, there are a couple areas I'm uncertain about and was hoping for some advice:

1. My Windows disk is an ""upgrade"" disc, and I no longer can locate my WinXP copy I upgraded from. I was told an ""upgrade"" disc has all the files, will I be able to install new OS on SSD through Windows?

2. I know I need mobo and GPU drivers, but are there other drivers needed? Do SSD, CPU, or RAM require any drivers?

3. I assume the OS won't take up the whole space, which other programs should be installed on the SSD? What's a good approach to what makes the SSD cut and what gets installed on the old HD? Ex. Firefox, Skyrim (I have a lot of mods, would they have to go too?), other games, Office, Rainmeter, any useful freeware?

4. Where is a good stopping point to create a clean image backup to keep on the old HD? What's a good strategy to decide which essential programs make the cut for that image?

Thank you in advance for any help you could lend."	t5_2sfgt	True

I've just discovered tiling window managers, I think they're pretty cool, but sometimes I want a floating desktop. So I came to thinking about solutions to my problem.

I've been searching unsuccessfully for a program for Windows 7 that would let me do the following:

* Have at least one more desktop
* Let my desktops be set to tiling or floating separately
* Let me set up the layout independently of the other

In my personal opinion, I think there is far more clarity and readability in gdipp than I was ever able to gain from ClearType and at the very least I encourage you to try it yourselves.

A comparison:

* http://gdipp.googlecode.com/hg/pic/gdipp_Segoe_UI.png - Segoe UI with gdipp 


You'll find the project here: http://code.google.com/p/gdipp/

I implore you to use the beta instead of the stable release, and remember to restart after installing so that the service is able to render properly.

Feel free to add your own tips!

***

###How do I get this data and stuff on my desktop?

A little app called Geektool. To quote its maker: 

&gt;GeekTool is an app for Mac OS 10.6+ It lets you display various kinds of information on your desktop via 3 default plug-ins:

&gt;File plugin to monitor MacOS X activity with /var/log/system.log, or any file that you want to follow. Shell mode to launch custom scripts or commands like ""df"" to check space left on filesystems or ""uptime"" to monitor load on your machine. Finally, image mode helps you monitor bandwith usage, CPU load, memory availability on your server with tools like [MRTG](http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/) or [RRD](http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/). 

Here are some links to download it:

* [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/geektool/id456877552?mt=12)

* [Tynsoe](http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/download.php).

***

###Okay, I downloaded it. What now? 

Check out some GeekTool script repositories for a start. 

I recommend [this](http://www.macosxtips.co.uk/geeklets/) as your first stop.

Once you're more comfortable, try playing around with [Geektool user commands](http://applevie.ws/2009/09/a-small-list-of-common-geektool-user-commands/) to tweak your setup. Here's [another link](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=628023) with some more.

***

###How do I display what music I'm playing?

Use [Bowtie](http://bowtieapp.com/) -- it has a whole boatload of different themes and it's constantly being updated with more.

***

###How can I hide my desktop icons?

I personally use [Camouflage](http://www.briksoftware.com/products/camouflage/). It's $5.99. But do some snooping around with your internet skills and you can find a free copy.

***

###How do I change my dock icons?

[This guide](http://pimpmymac.wordpress.com/2007/03/05/how-to-change-icons/) will take care of your folders, but most of your app and system icons need a little bit more than just copying and pasting. For this you're going to have to use [CandyBar](http://www.panic.com/blog/2012/08/candybar-mountain-lion-and-beyond/). It's now free! 

***

###How do I get rid of the menu bar? 

Well, you can't actually get rid of it. That stuff up there is important. But what you can do is download [Nocturne](http://nocturne.en.softonic.com/mac) (unfortunately, they have recently been hacked, but you should still be able to download the app using this link). Go into Preferences and check the box for ""Dim when inactive"". If you're going for a dark theme, check ""Invert menu bar"" too.

***

###How do I change my dock background?

This can be done using [CandyBar](http://www.panic.com/blog/2012/08/candybar-mountain-lion-and-beyond/) or [Blacktree Secrets](http://code.google.com/p/blacktree-secrets/).

My desktop is currently set up in a 3 monitor PLL configuration.  I want to set my back grounds up where each monitor has a different picture on it.

Here's where I come for help:

What I want:
For my boot screen to look like what Skyrim does for the first few seconds after launching it, i.e. with the Skyrim logo and smoke kinda doing its thing in the background. 
Then, when Windows transitions to the login screen, I would like it to look like [this](http://brainstomping.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/skyrim-menu.png), pretty much.

**Edit:** What you need to do is, as explained in the comments by brettawesome, Right-click on the individual component then left-click on: Settings, position, On desktop. This will cause it to go underneath the sidebar/taskbar (which are already at this setting) so the trick is to get them all ""on desktop"" and then do it for the taskbar and sidebars.

I use window snapping a lot but nothing ever remembers those positions on start up, and windows often open overlapping others in focus and open clustered in one location when I have a high definition monitor full of unused real estate. On Linux I can control at least some of those issues, so I was just wondering if anyone knew something that'd work similarly on Windows.

However there's a slight problem; in Windows 7 there's the feature where the folder icon displays some previews of the contents, and the change to the default icon does not seem to affect these folders (I'm guessing because of the preview function). [This is the problem I'm talking about](http://imgur.com/MdSQ6)

Is it possible to either cancel the preview feature or somehow make the preview feature work for a new default icon? Hopefully there's some computer wizardry out there that can do this!

Does a dock exist for windows (or an addon for one of the previously mentioned docks) that will bring this Docky-like functionality? I can't stand Autohide but I don't want my dock to be showing if a window is hovering over it.

I use Emerge Desktop's Tray and Tasks applet, but I have the running vertical along my monitor, similar to if you moved the windows task bar to either side.

There is a clock applet, but you can't set it to vertical, so most of it is cut off. I also have two clock widgets running using XWidget as well, but 99% of the time I have windows covering them up.

My question is, are there other alternatives to displaying the time so that I can see it without having to minimize/move windows? 

My only thought was if there was a program that displayed the time along the top an open window (by the close, min, max buttons)? I seem to think I ran across something like this before, but I tried searching for it, but I don't really know what the top of the window is called and nothing useful came back from searching.

I also don't want to have a clock widget always on top. I realize I can make one small and place it along the top of the monitor so when a window is maximized it's 'like' having it displayed in the window bar, but having windows 'always on top' is just a pet peeve of mine. :)

I got this idea when I went to my local sub /r/Memphis and found them doing a sister-city campaign with an invitation to post in the subreddit of our paired-city (it was somewhere in Austria). Subscriptions were boosted, and it brought some fresh air into /r/Memphis.


I liked how it worked out, and I think we can use a similar method to  shed some light on our sister-reddits, and at the same time grow our community in /r/customization. We can exchange sidebar links, or, we can have 'sponsored' x-posts, basically trading high-quality posts with other subs.

For those interested, this is supposed to be the ""idle"" view of my desktop.


Top left is irc with transparent background &amp; borders, the two little grey dots next to it are supposed to toggle the display of the nick list or to expand the tree view of the current server with channels and queries.


Top right is obviously a clock with date, pretty self-explanatory.
Although I would like it to behave like the windows built-in when I click it, i.e. show a Calendar and one or two different time-zones.


Middle right is desktop display &amp; control of the mp3 player (tbe grey round things representing the actual buttons). I want it to show Artist/title/time played/total time.
Maybe album art beneath, but I'm not sure about that one.


Bottom right - the little grey dot is supposed to expand the systray icons, although I'd like the background to be transparent as well.


Bottom middle is not the start menu orb relocated, it's an orb to display circledock. I'm not sure whether circledock supports the feature to show the circles with icons around them only if I click the button, but still, this is how I want it to be.


Bottom left is where you don't see anything right now since I wasn't sure how to represent it. I want it to be similar to the irc directly above it, a ""run on desktop"" email client that displays my inbox there.
Again, transparent background, so only the only things supposed to be visible here are the toolbar (compose, read, delete etc.) and sorting options for the inbox underneath (from, subject, sent).




Anyway, this is how I dream it should look. The clock probably won't be a big thing to tackle considering what I've seen here so far, neither will the mp3 player thingy. 
For the circledock, there are workarounds where I have a vague plan on how to realize my idea, so that again is nothing big on my mind.

What really bothers me are the systray, irc and email client elements.
I have irc partly figured out, but not nearly the way I actually want it to look but I have absolutely no clue about the systray and email stuff.


Anyway, sorry for the wall of text - I just wanted to share my vision of the perfect desktop that's mostly done with Paint with you."	t5_2sfgt	True

Edit: Also curious about the way it handled Steam/Pandora icons - I dragged them to the dock, but clicking them did nothing. Now, these are the only two programs that are already running in the notification bar. How do I get the icon to open the program?"	t5_2sfgt	True

I really like windows 8 but I agree with most people that the transition for the start screen to the desktop is jarring. So I have decided to take a snapshot of my startscreen and make it the desktop wallpaper.

What I would really like to do is make invisible icons on top of the tiles on the desktop wallpaper, preferably one that I could modify the icon sizes to make them the same size as the tiles. I would use the actual start screen as a ""minimize all windows to launch applications"" screen. Does anyone know a program that could do this? Thanks!

For a while, I have had a custom log-on screen animation. Just to clarify, I am NOT talking about changing the background image or the 'starting windows' animation. I am talking about the UI where the user selects his account and on the 'welcome' screen.

I had found a custom .dll somewhere online and had used it to replace the corresponding .dll in my System32 folder. In place of the spinning circle next to the 'welcome' and 'shutting down' text, the was a transparent glass-like windows logo. When the text would change, the new text would drop down from the top of the screen. Additionally, the user account selection page looked a lot like that in OSX. 

Unfortunately, about 18 months ago, my hard drive failed and I had to buy a new one. I have been wanting to change my new win7 install to the same UI but am unable to remember the nameof the file or where I got it from. Does anybody recognise this this customization from the description? If not, does anybody at least know which System32 file I would need to replace of this to happen?

I've been able to hook myself up with several monitors recently and am hoping that you guys would have some knowledge in this area.

As I'm running a 19"" 1024x1280 *(rotational)* and 17"" 1280x1024, I'm hoping to find a program that would allow for ease of use in the following areas:

* Windows-based with preferrably Aero transition support. *(I can hack something together for Linux if it doesn't already exist.)*
* Scaling and cropping to fit one image to both monitors while compensating for the differenciation in DPI.
* Taking into programmable compensation for the physical distance in both height and width between the two LCDs so as to allow curves and slants to not jump. Purposful loss in image swaths desirable to make it seem as a window into the images.

I've found John's Background Switcher to be pretty nice for a generic switcher, but it doesn't support spanning multi as far as I'd like. This issue will become more critical upon my having access to a 21"" 1680x1050 rotational that'll be spending more time in 1050x1680 mode.

Currently I am trying to add additional launchers in enigma instead of the usual 5. I copy-paste one of the folders, edit all the appX to appY in the ini file, and continue on getting it to work. Everything I change works just fine, the problem comes when I try and move it in proximity of another launcher icon.

[This picture](http://i.imgur.com/uVSRU.jpg) shows my desktop in the super early stages. The problem is that right now, the ventrilo icon is overlapping the starcraft II icon. If I tried to click on the starcraft II icon at the time of this picture, it would think I was opening Ventrilo. If I move away the ventrilo launcher then starcraft II works as it is supposed to. Anyone know how to fix this?

Edit for clarification: After a little testing it appears all of the launchers have this dead space that you can still click on to launch the app. It extends about again as long as the text displays, but so far I have been unable to locate the variable to change this.

Another Edit: Changing the SkinWidthMultiplier to 1 from 2 seems to help, but so far that deadspace is not quite gone."	t5_2sfgt	True
