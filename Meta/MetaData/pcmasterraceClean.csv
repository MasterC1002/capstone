The threads containing pictures of the console peasants and how 'we' are superior are more bountiful than the frames-per-second of our god-tier shrines to Gaben. 


We are the superior life form. It is high time we acted as such. Putting down others in order to lift ourselves up is not the way. The True Path to Enlightenment must be found within ourselves, not by seeking approval from the outside. 


These boards have become a cesspool of console filth, rather than a shining beacon for those lost in the void. If we are to prosper we must stop this incessant cruelty. 


You are being trolled, left-and-right by the filthy, unwashed masses. Yet you fall for it every day. Be it on the Book of Faces or the Twitter-sphere. 


This place should be full of the makings of our kind. A place of good thoughts, good conversations, and good builds. Can't you see this negativity brings us down. How shall we rise above? 


&gt; We will give the people an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind us, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join us in the sun. In time, we will help them accomplish wonders. 



Our guiding principals remain clear and focused. We must stop this constant mocking of the filthy console peasants. For if all our time is spent talking about them and their idiot boxes, what time do we devote to The Great and Mighty Gaben? What time do we devote to that which we claim is our common passion? 

We are better than this."	t5_2sgp1	True

1373415588.0	1hz18d	I converted a console peasant. It was too easy.	animeman59	216	35	87	"So, the son of a coworker was talking about the new consoles that were revealed during the latest E3, and said that the consoles were now more powerful than current PCs.  Being the ever-vigilant PC prophet that I was, I had to set this kid straight.  I gave him the usual spiel about PCs.  Blah-blah-blah.

He still wasn't convinced (typical teenager), and that's because the only PCs he's ever been around was the crappy Dell computer that the family used, and his Dad's work laptop which was probably the most powerful machine he's seen (new Ivy-Bridge ultrabook).  When talking about gaming PCs, he thinks about $5000+ Alienware machines.

Needless to say, the boy was completely clueless about PC gaming in general.

When he started spouting off BS about how the graphics in PC games are not that much different from consoles, I decided to take a more direct approach.  I invited him and his Dad over to my place to show what a real PC battlestation looks like.

http://imgur.com/a/1BwD7

When I asked him what his most played game was, he answered Call of Duty (of course).  I had the console copies of Modern Warfare 3, and Black Ops 2 as well as the PC counterparts (all given to me by friends who stopped playing).  Since I had an Xbox 360 hooked up to my secondary monitor, I loaded up both the PC and console versions of each game side by side.

His jaw, literally, dropped.  He has never really seen gaming in 1080p, with graphics cranked up to their max settings.  Now, CoD isn't the most graphically intensive game out there, especially Black Ops which uses the old CoD:MW1 engine while MW3 has the newest one, but giving it the good ol' PC treatment still makes it look good.  I explained to him that most console games from this generation didn't display real 1080p, because it wasn't common in 2006, and the hardware couldn't support it.

When he started to defend the next-gen consoles about their hardware and how they will do actual 1080p, I just showed him a spec comparison to my prior machine and the current consoles.  So, yes, while the new consoles will have impressive specs, us PC gamers have had similar hardware for the past 2 years.  And in the next 2 years, we have even better machines.

Then he asked about the price of making one of these PC rigs.  I showed him my current one.

http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1g9k7i/build_complete_my_new_2013_amd_build/

It's is a little bit more expensive that what most people spend, but I also showed him builds from other PC gamers that costs much less.  He saw that he could make himself a kick ass PC gaming rig for $1000 which includes a monitor, K+M, and an OS.

He saw the light.  Even his Dad was impressed by what people can build.  So, now, I'm helping them both with getting their own awesome PC gaming machines.  I'm making a parts list for two gaming machines, and I'm going to be helping them build in the next few weeks.

My evangelist mission is complete.

**TL:DR:**  I helped turn a console peasant to the light.  I even converted his family.  Praise Gaben."	t5_2sgp1	True

1373494603.0	1i1ev1	The Basics of PC Master Race For Neophytes	voodoopork	92	7	39	"**neophyte**: /ˈnēəˌfīt/ (noun)
•	A person who is new to a subject, skill, or belief. An initiate.

The Steam Sale is upon us, brothers. [It’shappeningronpaul.gif](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ron-Paul_Its-Happening1.gif)! The sale will undoubtedly draw new PC gamers, and I wrote this up as a helpful guide to our newest members.

If you just built or bought your first gaming PC, welcome to the Master Race. It’s a good feeling: the surge of power from your PSU, the hum of the cooling fans, and the satisfaction of gaming accomplishment. An entire world of superior graphics, customization, game experiences, community, and entire history of gaming awaits you. We welcome you! This is a community to flaunt your rig’s performance, share awesome PC gaming content, shame console peasantry, and smugly bask in the hellish glow of a thousand red rings of death. 


**r/PCMasterRace Glossary**:

**PC Master Race**: a term coined by Ben “Yahtzee” Croshaw to satirically coin the attitude and sense of superiority that PC gamers have over console-only gamers.

**Gaben**: Gabe Newell, co-founder and managing director of Valve Corporation. Sort of like our patron saint. A portly visionary in terms of digital distribution and owner of many knives. 

**Console Peasant**: A console-only gamer. PC gamers generally look down on console gamers as lazily settling for second best in terms of performance and gaming experience. Console gamers are considered low skill and immature.

**Filthy Casuals**: Gamers content to play exclusively mobile or social media games only, yet call themselves “PC gamers”. 

**Blasphemy**: Anytime a console gamer attempts to claim platform superiority, or when a PC gamer/company stoops to the peasant’s lowest common denominator. 

**Ascension**: Building/buying your first PC gaming computer.

**Gaben Shrines**: a powerful PC gaming setup. Also known as a Command Center or Battlestation.

**Mac Heretics**: Mac users. Mac hardware is often substandard and developed in a closed development environment, making it similar to a console in this regard. Mac users are tolerated, but not normally considered true computer gamers. 

**“Half-Life 3 Confirmed”**: The third installment of the popular and influential Half-Life has not been officially announced, and many rumors exist of its potential release date and features. Rumor threads often end with the idea of “Half-Life 3 Confirmed”, but this is more commonly used as a satirical jab at the more zealous conspiracy theories. 

**YouTube Comment Threads**: “But what about that shadowy place?” “That's beyond our borders. You must never go there, Simba.”

**The PC Master Race Commandments**

1.	A PC gamer is made by owning a PC gaming rig, rather than by simply not playing consoles.
2.	Screenshots and build specs or no ascension.
3.	There is no such thing as too powerful or too high.
4.	There is nothing more superior than treating a lady gamer with class and respect. We are all more equally superior to the console masses.
5.	Do not suffer a shitty port to live.
6.	Thou shalt mod as thou wish. 
7.	Be loyal to quality games, not brands. We are the Master Race, not fanboys.
8.	Multiplayer will not tolerate childish behavior, regardless of age. 
9.	Thou shalt use [pcpartpicker.com](http://pcpartpicker.com/) to find the best deals on hardware. 
10.	Thou shalt help others ascend. We are a community who shame the willfully ignorant, not the curious and eager.

So, what do you guys really prefer, and why? My theory for the reason Nvidia cards are more widely used in this subreddit is that being the master race, we just don't care as much as other subreddits that they are more expensive. It makes sense to me speaking from personal experience.

They're powered by a GTX 780 which sits on a Asus P9X79 Pro mobo, and, as a proud parent, I'm aiming for getting that little rascal a sibling. Not sure if I'm keeping the H100 CPU water-cooler, or building a loop throughout the system.

My 3930K is from one of the good batches, clocking it to 5Ghz takes not much voltage at all, and everything is as stable as can be. Mind you it's not 24/7, only when I'm flying in FSX and want that extra juice and visuals from add-ons. Pondering VRM cooling, or if the airflow from my six fans in my HAF 932 is enough...

I'm a classically trained musician, so I care about sound quality. When composing I always give a nod to Asus for making the great affordable Xonar Essence STX sound card, and Sony for the MDR-7506 headphones. Often I sit and just play around with the Vienna Instruments because, dude, it just sounds so freaking good!

It's a good time to be part of the master race. I want to share it with everyone! If I were rich I'd buy a PC to everyone in the world! In particular to the owners of the ridiculous consoles and the extremely feminine Apple products.

I immediately scoured my friends house and my cousin's room (he was going to collage so i managed to get his collection). 

Oh the joy i felt when I began to play! Dune 2000, MDK, age of empires, X wing, Wing commander, Viruz, TIE Fighter, all the epic Lucas arts games, as time passed i played MDK2, Not one lives forever, Medal of honor: allied assault, Return to castle wolfenstein, Aquanox...

The list of great games goes on and on. I don't have those disks anymore. Time took its toll, most of them probably wouldn't even run on todays machines. 

This is where CD Projekt RED comes in. After seeing the post about wicher 3 i realized most of us are not aware about another of their great endeavor. www.gog.com


They have updated and moded all those great retro games to run on a modern rig and sell them at a surprisingly low price **Without any sort of DRM**. 

I am not in anyway connected with them, but I shall recommend them at any chance I get, not only because this stops the console peasants from going on ""But new PC costs too much money, and i can't play any good game on my shiny pink laptop/pc"" whining , but also because I want them to prosper and acquire more great games to add to their wondrous library. 

I have spoken what i came here to say, Farewell and game on!

Edit: [they support mac too and if you go at the end of the list you shall see some FREE games!] (http://www.gog.com/catalogue?system=osx)

Pre-builds.  Why in the world are we recommending pre-built PCs?

[Take a look at this recent discussion with someone who wants a recommendation on a boutique PC maker.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1gp3it/brothers_where_can_i_get_a_pc_built_in_the_us/)

Notice how the some of responders are recommending a builder like CyberPowerPC?  Why?  Why are you recommending this shitty builder?  Is this really the only experience you've had with PC gaming?  Buying from a horrid builder like them?  They don't even recommend high-end builders like Falcon Northwest, Origin Systems, Puget, or Maingear which, at least, have a reputation for great builds, the problem being the high costs for that excellent work.

And there are many other posts just like this in which people are proudly claiming their pre-builds as being superior gaming machines.

I'm sorry, but it's not.  And it never will be.

You want to know why other PC subreddits never recommend a pre-built system?  Because it does you no good in the long run.  Ever.

For the new console plebeians entering into PC gaming, we know that it can be a daunting task to build your own.  But you need to do it.  PCs are not electronic devices like a DVD player that should ""just work"".  If you want a gaming machine that ""just works"", then buy a console.  Seriously, go buy a console.  It works right out of the box, and there is no work involved for you.

And it's even worse to get a pre-built, because you have no idea what's inside the machine.  You didn't do the research on any of the components.  What brands are included?  How does it perform?  Is it reliable?  What's the cost of each component?  You do none of the research and just take whatever the builder puts in there to turn a profit.  I have seen too many pre-built machines with absolutely horrendous power supplies that are guaranteed to blow up after a few months of usage.  Even worse when someone decides to add a component in there without knowing the power requirements and frying their entire system.

The absolute worst is when someone buys a ""gaming PC"", and it includes a graphics card like a Geforce 610, and then they'll wonder, ""Where's the performance that I was promised for going PC?"".  CyberPowerPC and other builders are **very** guilty of these kinds of shenanigans.

So in the eyes of a console gamer, they just wasted several hundreds of dollars on a machine that doesn't even work.  Should've just stayed with a console, and save some money.

In my mind, as a PC gamer, you have to build your own.  There's a hurdle that you must go over in order to fully experience the benefits of going PC.  If you don't, then you're just going to experience frustration after frustration during your time with it.

And the thing is, it's easier now more than any other time in the past to build your own PC.  When someone tells you it's like Legos, there is a small amount of truth in that.  A lot of things are now just plug and play.  I built my first PC as a teenager in the late 90's, building a machine in the Windows 98 days, and it was a real pain in the ass, but I eventually got it to work, and I never looked back since.

I know that this subreddit is a circle-jerk.  We make jokes about the console peasants and their horrid ad revenue machines; while extolling the virtues of the glorious PC master race, looking down upon the filthy masses.  If this subreddit stayed that way, then I wouldn't be complaining at all.  But when we start receiving posts asking for recommendations, troubleshooting, and advice regarding the world of PC gaming, then we need to drop the bullshit and give actual **real** advice.

We need to set a standard here, and following that standard means that we will have more fellow PC gamers enjoying their favorite hobby on our preferred device of choice.

For those who have not built their own machines yet, stop giving recommendations to other people.  Especially if those recommendations include builders with dubious reputations.  You haven't crossed that threshold yet.

Build your own, brethren.

Glorious rant over.

I'm betting the influx of our new brethren includes others that haven't been blessed by glorious Gaben before so here's the things you need to know about summer sales:

There are several types of Summer Sale deals:

* All sale deals: These will be available for the entire sale(Generally 10 days), no need to buy early, in fact you should specifically not buy until the last day.
* Daily deals: Every morning at 10am PST the current daily sales will swap out for new ones.  If something is on daily deal that you want it's a good time to buy, it might go on sale again later on but not something you can guarantee.
* Flash deals: Flash deals last 8-12 hours cycling throughout the day, these will usually have repeats by the end of the sale but no guarantee, grab 'em when you see them if you want 'em.  I can't remember ever seeing a flash sale go on sale further than the flash price
* Community Choice deals: again 8-12 hours long, but selected by community vote.  These again you should grab when you see them but like the flash deals will frequently begin to repeat by sales end.
* Pack deals: These packs will contain anything from a series to an entire publisher library at crazy low rates.  Sometimes with packs you can trade or give away any games from the pack you already own but I wouldn't count on it.  If the pack is a good deal for you, snag it.
* Last day: The last couple of sales the last day, or even the day after the last has become an ""encore"" day, bringing back the most popular deals for the sale incase you missed them.  Don't count on it though, if you missed something you might get a second chance but it's no guarantee.

Additionally since the sales swap at 10am, there is usually a mass rush from about 9:50-10:30 where steam becomes nearly inaccessible, mid afternoon tends to be the best time to get things.  The US download servers tend to overload also, sometimes switching to something insane (I usually use Romania) will actually net you better download speeds.  This won't affect your ability to buy games, just to download ones once you own them.

So there you have it brethren.  Get out there and enjoy the sales!  If there is an interest I could be talked into compiling daily deal lists for us but there's probably already someone doing a better job than I in /r/gaming.

Oh, and if you are not currently a member of the master race but will be soon (Building a system, waiting on parts, etc) you can buy games on the sale through the steam website now, and then install them later once your system is complete.  Purchases are tied to account not to system.

There are also usually sale related goals and stuff to get steam badges, these are not necessary to getting good deals but they can be fun.  This years seem to be related to the new trading cards."	t5_2sgp1	True

I wondered onto youtube to stumble apon a glorious, glorious video. There it was, the budget build. I was desperate to build a PC, console became so bland, and the hours put into playing my peasant-box were dwindling. So I built... and built, and built some more! Until my budget build was no longer a mere console replacement; it was a console destroyer.

I have never enjoying gaming so much, not even in the early days of my peasantry. One can only dream of converting my friends from the depths. 

tl;dr - used to be a peasant, realised the glorious world of pc gaming. Built a PC. Ascended.

So yesterday I had a caprice that I wanted to play a driving game. When I was one of those peasants few years ago I used to play A LOT of driving games with my Playstation 2, which I enjoyed a lot. Since I got rid off the heretic system I can't play them with consoles.

I was browsing my glorious Steam library and I noticed that have Dirt 3 which came with my glorious HD6950. I knew that driving a car with a keyboard is something terribad. Even though I knew what risks would occur if I did it, but I decided to buy myself a controller.

So, there I was, sitting with on my chair while holding the package. I knew if I touched that bloody thing there might be no way returning back. But the temptation was stronger and I got rid off the package. 

And I did it. I held the controller with both of my hands.

It was something familiar. Having sticks under my thumbs was something.. relaxing. L2 and R2 buttons were not familiar, but I didn't mind about it.

So I started playing the game. I played it for three hours. Single-player. Rally. My god how good time I had.

After I stopped playing I had thoughts like ""What the Bioshock would be like If I played it with a controller? Or Diablo? Or how worse I would be if I played Planetside 2 with a controller? I doubt I wouldn't be so much worse that it wouldn't be relevant..""

At that moment I realized something terrible: the controller was indoctrinating me! I instantly dropped the controller and went to bathroom and washed my hands for 10 minutes. I had done something terrible. The controller was influencing by spitting me it's heretics thoughts! Was it trying to turn me slowly into lifeless peasant who would play Call of Duty and pre-order all the DLC!

After that I started playing some Planetside 2 so I could get all the peasant thoughts out of my head.

My mind is still shocked what happened. Should I destroy the controller so I could survive? Is there any ways to counter the indoctrination, like wearing gloves or something? Am I gone already too far?

I really like my Dirt 3 but I can't take the risk by playing it with a controller and slowly turning into peasant.."	t5_2sgp1	True

However, if you feel the need to post your new build, PLEASE for the love of Gaben, provide pictures! It is really disappointing to see a brothers build but not see some glorious pictures that I can revel in. Even if your build isn't new, PLEASE post some sexy ass pictures.

a) Was hand crafted with your glorious hands (or even a friend's glorious hands)

b) Plays games in glorious graphics

or

c) Simply because you are that glorious.

PC vs. Console Gaming: An Eternal Struggle

   Video games have become an integral and defining aspect in the lives of many of the world's children, adolescents, young adults and even adults in today's society.  From Atari's “Pong” in June 1972, one of the first video games ever released, to Blizzard's “World of Warcraft,” the world's most popular online video game today, video games have evolved exponentially in terms of quality, complexity, popularity and profitability.  They have built a legacy that will last forever, and have entered our homes with no plans of relenting, but pose a question:  How will you play them?  Personal Computers (PC's) were the first to be able to develop and play video games, but their younger brother, the console, has encroached on the PC's territory, invading living rooms and stealing gamers' attention.  Consoles offer a more budget-friendly alternative to PC's, as well as more party-friendly options and a simpler user-interface (UI).  However, in terms of gaming capabilities, community-involvement and overall value, PC's are far superior to consoles.
   
   To put things bluntly, consoles are cheap.  This is a boon to many, but a foible to others.  In contrast, PC's are expensive, but for all of the right reasons.  Joel Gregory illustrates this point in a simple allegory, ""PC gaming is your hundred-grand supercar: pretty, expensive, and absolutely not for everybody.  Consoles are your mid-range hot hatches: reasonable, reliable, and far more approachable"" (Gregory).  Gregory goes on to explain how a £175 ($200) PS3 can play most new games,  whereas not a single PC, let alone a gaming PC, has a comparable price.  Furthermore, PC's require consistent upgrading to perform perfectly, which can add up quickly, while consoles are an easy one-time payment, skipping the hassle for your wallet.  
   
   Even if money is not an object, consoles still offer a feature that PC's are not engineered for:  fellowship.  Think about it - which is easier:  invite 3 of your friends to bring their huge, clunky computers over so that each of you sit by yourself and play individually next to each other, or invite 3 of your friends to bring their own tiny controller over so you can all sit together on the couch and look at the same screen?  In the words of Mark Tiongco, ""Even though Madden 2011 is available for PC, most sports fans would rather play it on an Xbox 360/PS3 because of the easier gamepad.... Furthermore, fighting games like Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe are more socially preferred [on consoles] as everyone is usually huddled around a big-screen television.""  Also, motion-controlled gaming on the Wii, Xbox Kinect, and Playstation Move offer closer interaction and something that everyone can enjoy, while PC gamers have to be glued to their desk chairs.
   
   In addition to cost efficiency and social potential, consoles excel in simplicity.  The standard Windows keyboard has 104 keys on it, each with their own unique purpose.  Factor in all of the mouse's functions, and you have quite the perplexing array of options, which might intimidate potential gamers.  The Xbox 360's controller, on the other hand, has 4 buttons, a four-way directional pad, 2 thumb-operated joysticks, 2 index finger-operated triggers and 2 bumper buttons, for a grand-total of 14 individual commands, considerably less than the keyboard and mouse combo.  According to Mark Tiongco, the Xbox 360 has the same basic platform as when it launched in 2005, almost 8 years ago, and uses the same format of discs.  “Therefore, there are no headaches and issues about compatibility on games and accessories” (Tiongco).  
  
   While it is unfair to say that consoles do not have their merits, when directly compared to the awe-inspiring potential of a well-built gaming PC, consoles don't even have the slightest chance of going toe-to-toe.  Perhaps the greatest and most obvious advantage of a PC is its computing capabilities.  Ryan King explains that ""PC hardware can be removed and upgraded when it falls behind, ensuring you always have a purring beast of a gaming machine.  The creaking legs of Xbox 360 and PS3 can’t keep up with newer games.  They’re stuck with the same hardware as seven years ago, hiding their wrinkles behind gimmicks"" (King).  What this means is that games have to be dumbed-down to be able to play on these outdated consoles, while at the same time are optimized to utilize the very best that high-end PC's have to offer (Tiongco).  When comparing the numbers, processing power on the GPU, which stands for Graphics Processing Unit, adds up to only 250MHz on the Wii, 500MHz on the Xbox 360, and 550 MHz on the PS3.  The typical mid-range PC's GPU can reach speeds over 1GHz, double that of the PS3 and Xbox 360 and quadruple that of the Wii (Ignite).  Also, PC's have the option of overclocking, pushing their hardware to their absolute limits in search of greater performance.  Consoles are not capable of this.  Even future consoles can't line up accurately with current PC's.  According to Brad Chacos, the announced PS4, not even available yet, has specifications that are loosely comparable to low-end Intel i3 processors and an AMD Radeon HD 7850, which is mid-range at best.  Therefore, it can be concluded that PC's will remain in their own league for some time to come.  A rule of thumb when buying electronics, not just limited to consoles, is that once you buy it, it becomes obsolete.  This illustrates the rapid improvement of computing technology, so rapid in fact that a newer, cheaper and more efficient alternative to everything computer-related is never over a year away on average.  Another pro concerning the interchangeability of PC's is repair.  While the Xbox 360 has a 23.7% rate of failure after 2 years and the PS3 has a 10% rate, PC's can replace each individual part that fails (Ignite).  For example, if your PS3 breaks, you have to spend $200 on a new one, but if your PC's power supply fails, you can pick a new one up from Newegg for as low as $50!
   
   The next addition to the PC's superior characteristics is community.  All console games are created on a computer, so naturally most of them would be available on the PC as well.  On top of those, a vibrant and expanding group of developers create Indie-games and Kickstarter projects that can be found nowhere else but the PC.  The aspect of the PC community that has the largest consumer impact is without a doubt mod-ability.  Third-party mods are available for most popular PC games, and these allow anything from visual enhancement via texture packs to the ability to turn dragons into Macho Man Randy Savage! (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bifmj1O3D24)  Next, the Steam client has been introduced to connect PC gamers in a manner similar to the console's interfaces, while offering periodic sales of up to 95% off video games.  These opportunities compensate significantly in the long run for the PC's higher initial cost (King).
   
   This paper has analyzed how PC's and consoles compare solely as gaming machines, but neglected the fact that PC's are capable of so much more!  ""First, a computer can do everything a console can do but can also be used to check email, download music, write papers, do research, conduct business, and edit photos and much more. Hence, its utility is plenty for a consumer. Second, with the rapid spread of technology, a computer can be continuously upgraded with new hardware to accommodate new technologies and new games that take advantage of next-generation graphical eye candy"" (Tiongco).  While custom-built gaming desktop PC's have the best available performance, gaming laptops also exist.  This adds a feature of portability that becomes invaluable for students and businesspeople who need their applications on the go, while not wanting to sacrifice their leisure opportunities found in gaming.  The possibilities for computers are endless, while consoles in themselves can do little more than play games, while at a lower quality.  Gaming PC's are superior to consoles, and this will not change.

1375120874.0	1jagoi	The story of a Mac heretic and his desperate need to appear superior.	the_greatest_bear	34	4	34	"So, I used to work at a Best Buy.  I didn't love it, but it paid the bills and the discount was pretty alright on a lot of products.  I used to work with this guy who was the biggest Mac elitist that I've ever met.  

Some of his more charming quotes: 

""If it's not Apple, I won't touch it."" 
""Apples are cheap when you consider what you're getting."" 
""Save yourself the headache, buy a Mac."" 

Now, I don't HATE Macs.  I think they're useful for people who don't know about computers, but this guy lived in such a fairy tale that it was impossible to take him seriously.  

One day, a woman came into the store.  She didn't know anything about computers, but she was trying to buy her son a nice gift for his college graduation.  She told the heretic that he played lots of games.  Obviously, her son wanted/needed a PC, but the heretic told her to buy a Mac.  

""The idea that PC's are better for gaming is completely false.  My Macbook Pro with Retina Display can play anything PC's can, only better."" 

This was my breaking point.  I called him out in front of the customer.  I informed the customer that, while there are programs designed to run Windows programs on OSX, Apple products lack the power necessary to achieve a decent frame rate.  

Like a wounded animal, the Apple fan boy went into full defense mode.  

""Not true! I promise my Macbook is more powerful than your PC."" 

(He clearly did not see the aura of Gaben that surrounded me)

While his Macbook had pretty decent stats for a heretic machine, my PC bested him at every turn.  Defeated, he mocked me for buying ""hardware I didn't need.""

I absolutely hate it when the peasants say, as a Pro-Console argument that ""You need to spend a lot of money on graphics cards and upgrade often"".

Since when do you have to spend a lot on graphics cards?  For heavens sakes spending around $150 will get you a GPU that functions very well.  I mean its no GTX 770, but it will still be miles ahead of console offerings.  I personally bought a GTX 650 ti boost, and with some overclocking of the already overclocked version got it up to 1.2Ghz, which, for the most part, is enough for my low income situations.  Teenager here....anyway!

And ""YOU NEED TO UPGRADE"".  This is such a stupendously hypocritical statement.  The console peasant blasting PC's because they need to be upgraded.  GahhhhHHHH!!!! You don't *need* to upgrade.  I mean, its  as if they think that games are more demanding for PC's to run, when in reality PC's can just handle a higher workload.  I guess for them the graphics are always shitty, but I guess for PC gamers you can easily tell when the next AAA title is more graphically demanding.

Yes, you need to upgrade if you want to stay up to date and maintain GPU prowess, but by not upgrading until, say the next console releases, you will still, STILL have a better graphical experience than that of the console player.  **It is the console peasant, who is stuck with stagnate hardware, bashing PC's for the ability to upgrade.  The ultimate definition of hypocrisy and peasantry.** "	t5_2sgp1	True

Valve announces an impromptu conference at the beginning of E3.  Everybody curiously attends to see what Valve has in store for them.  As the conference starts, Gabe Newell walks onto the stage.  He says nothing when he enters.

Instead, standing in the middle of the stage, he lifts one finger into the air.  The lights dim, and the big projector screen behind him lights up.  The number 3 appears.  Everybody gasps.  Quiet words are uttered.  

Is it what everyone hoped?  Is it here?

Instead, the name ""Team Fortress"" fills in the left side of the 3, and a trailer plays of the new Team Fortress game.  Everyone calms down.  Some are slightly disappointed, but a new Team Fortress is a welcome surprise by all, and the trailer shows TF being played on a new engine.  Everyone suspects that it's the new Source 2 engine.  Looks great.  Trailer ends.  Applause all around.  Not bad.

Then the lights brighten.  Gaben is still there.  Still not saying anything.  Then he lifts his hand again.  Only this time, he has two fingers in the air.

The lights dim, and the number 3 appears again behind him.  What is this?  People look at each other wondering what is going on.  Then the trailer for Left 4 Dead 3 plays.  Also on the new Source engine.  It's intense, frightening, and fun.  Everything everyone expects from the L4D series.  New characters, including old ones, fighting side by side against hordes of infected.  Trailer ends.  Everyone applauds.  This is getting really good.

Lights brighten again.  Gaben is still there.  Still silent.  Everyone is now tense.

He lifts his hand in the air.  Some are now at the edge of their seats.  He now has three fingers extended.  The lights dim.

Is this it?  Finally?

We see the number 3.  And then we hear it.  He hear...... her.

""This is for science.""

The new trailer for Portal 3 plays.  The stage gets an audible sigh of regret.  Some are disappointed.  Portal 3 looks amazing.  New puzzles.  New modes.  More GLaDos.  It's an awesome trailer, and a game that many will be anticipating.  But the one thing they wanted is still not there.  Trailer ends.  Everyone applauds.

Lights are up, and there stands Gaben.  Still there.  Still looking at the audience.  He stays silent for what seems like forever.

What the hell is going on?  What is this?  Isn't this over?

Gaben looks at the crowd.  He lifts his hand.  He points one finger in the air.

Wait.....

He points another finger in the air.  Could it be?

He points a third.  Is it?

He extends four fingers into the air, and the lights dim.  **IS IT?!**

You see the number 3 on screen, and then you hear it.  You hear.....  Him.

""Rise and Shine, Mr. Freeman.""

Half Life 3's trailer starts playing, but no one can hear the intro music, because the whole conference erupts in screams, laughter, and chaos.  It is finally here.  It's done, and it's finally been revealed to us.  The one thing we've been waiting so long for.

It.  Is.  Here.

The trailer continues.  People are half trying to watch, half trying to get the glorious news out to the masses.  It's everything we hoped.  The visuals are a new standard by which every other game will be measured.  Our favorites are back, and new faces are there.  It's to be an epic adventure.

The trailer ends.  Everyone cheers.  The sound is deafening, but no one cares.  Half Life 3 is really  here.

The lights brighten again.  Everyone wants to congratulate Gabe Newell.  But he's not there.  The stage is empty.

Instead, the screen plays another video.  It lists each title in order.

* Team Fortress 3 - Free to Play
 
* Left 4 Dead 3 - 29.99 on Steam
 
* Portal 3 - 29.99 on Steam

can we cut the BS on bottlenecks, recently theres been a ton of posts like

""will a 6300 bottleneck a 760"" 

""will a i5 bottleneck a 7950"" 

and comments along those lines.


now people lets get some facts right:

- 99.9% of the time the GPU is the bottleneck in most games

- games that are CPU intensive are few and far between (apart from PS2 and civ i cant think of any)

- using current chips (ie anything better than a fx 4300 or a I3) you shouldnt get a bottleneck with a single card. (titans, 690's and 7990s may be the excepetion, but if your spending that much on a GPU get a better CPU) and even phenoms, intel core2 and the like should not give many major bottlenecks.

- most bottlenecks ive seen are from either REALLY slow HDD's, or from DDR2 ram.


-------------

so lets keep the serious stuff to serious subs, but lets not fill this sub with BS.

cheers

Brothers and sisters of the Order of Dedicated GPUs. I have been with you since this past November, when I cast off my shackles placed on me by the Big 3. I tore away my sack cloth rags drenched in the filth and shit of disc based gaming, and I built a worthy machine that will smite the hell out of any lowly peasant toy for some time to come. I speak of this now, bc most of my time was spent catching up on console exclusives I had missed out on. Therefore they were somewhat dated. However, yesterday, I purchased Skyrim from the market of our Lord Gaben known as the Holy Steam. I was blessed with the knowledge that my machine is worthy to run such a game at Ultra Highest of settings. The moment I saw the opening cinematic....I knew I had missed out on so much. I remember the visuals from the PS3 version...I remember the stuttering frame rates, I remember the awful textures, I remember the load screens......(quiet sob)....taking 45 seconds or longer, and that was if it didn't crash entirely.

The peasants have always mocked us with their arrogance and infuriated us with their ignorance, but perhaps they have done the master race a favor for once.  Now, games almost always look and perform better on the PC, especially with texture packs, more advanced shaders, and higher frame rates, but not much more. We have constantly been limited by the engine technology designed for the minuscule amounts of RAM these inferior consoles have, but is that about to change?  With an 8 GB console, won't we start to see MORE 64 bit native games, and engines that will actually wake up our i7 machines from their slumbering dreams of a few instructions here and there?  I think this is our opportunity! Let the peasants have their time! Only to watch it be short lived as the superior race sweeps it out from beneath their feet!

Some folks at r/gaming seriously started defending that quote and said it is actually rocket science level. Trying to explain them why it is not only ends up in downvotes and irrelevant insults - what a bunch of fucking animals.

The technology to detect a heardbeat from a video was there already. And no, it was not invented by Microsoft. It is called ""invisible motion detection"" and was developed by MIT. Algorithm is open sourced. (This comes down to: everyone can implement such a thing now, even with ordinary camera, it's totally NOT rocket science)

It was even posted on Reddit 2 months ago http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/19nafw/detect_a_heart_beat_from_a_video_with_this_open/

I think everyone should understand that companies such as Microsoft and Apple never really invented anything. They only bring already old technology to their clients. The technology invented by some one else - that was already available for years - but most people had no clue about.

Although we must admit these companies do bring technology to ordinary people who otherwise would be.. ""too stupid"" to acquire it. But we all should be aware, they bring technology that is old - and by no means innovate.

These happened last night. I was talking to a co-worker about computers and I told him I built my own gaming rig back in February. 

He said that he doesn't want a computer for gaming, but for multi-tasking. I gave him a weird look because gaming PCs are the perfect computers. Multi-tasking, games, videos, etc. They do everything for you and last a long time. You can do practically anything with a gaming rig. 

My wtf moment came from a guy who I was talking about TL2 with. He asked if I would give him a spare computer because he has a little netbook and wants to play TL2. 

He said that he spent most of his money on Xbox and Xbox Live so he has no extra money. I just gave him a look of wtf?! This isn't the first time this has come up. 

People I talk to tell me PC gaming is too expensive, but they will spend 4-500 bucks on consoles! Another 100 bucks or so and they have a computer that can do so much more than the consoles and it winds up costing less in the long run. 

tl;dr People tell me gaming PCs aren't for multi-tasking and beg me to give them spare computers because they spent all their money on Xbox."	t5_2sgp1	True

Back durings its launch on PC, Bioshock contained a notorious variant of SecuROM with activation limits. You may have known about this variant in another game called Spore. I am a staunch believer of voting with your wallets, so I never purchased Bioshock at the time. By the time 2K removed SecuROM from Bioshock, I have already moved on to other titles... until one day, thanks to GabeN, it was on a holiday sale and a friend purchased it for me. It sat in my backlog until I decided to play it.

Upon booting up the game for the first time, I was immediately hit with nostalgia - and not the good kind. Mouse acceleration and limited FOV promptly made me quit the game in search of ini tweaks. The FOV lock option ingame was passable enough, but the mouse acceleration definitely required some ini tinkering. Although SecuROM was gone, the other parts of consolitis remained. It definitely reminded me that us PC gamers had it pretty bad in terms of console ports, starting in 2007.

Hell, a lot of things happened in 2007.

* COD4 not only marked the beginning of its dominance on consoles, but was also the last prominent PC COD (other than WaW, I guess) to allow both mods and dedicated servers.
* Crysis happened, moving graphics forward. It was also the least linear game in the Crysis franchise..
* The rise of restrictive DRM. Starforce was probably the first prominent one that gathered negative attention, but SecuROM with activation limits exploded the topic with Spore and Bioshock.

Thankfully, with more and more members joining our master race, publishers has been slowly adding back little things too, like FPS capping and FOV sliders. It also helps that we have a healthy indie scene as well. PC titles may not have completely regained their former glory selves, but they are slowly improving, and there's plenty of alternatives, from indies to PC-only developers/publishers (Paradox, Bohemia, etc.).

Buying a small premade pc seems to defeat the purpose of calling it a valve console instead of just a computer. Wouldn't that make it just a console made out of consumer parts? Seeing as the concept of a steambox is very small there not much room for an upgrade. Spending money on a prebuilt pc isn't something new. I can see how it would make the console to pc switch easier to adapt to but besides that it just seems like valve is trying to become Dell or HP by making a pc with little to no upgrading ability.

At first, I wasn't impressed when he showed me his rig. On the outside it was but a simple basic form much like any other computer I have seen in my **filthy** lifetime. It wasn't until he turned it on, when he opened the most bizarre program.

Steam. I have never heard of this program in my life and I was amazed by it and it's unique beauty of buying games online for *amazing* prices. It was but a mere minute later when I was completely engulfed in this game of ""TF2"". What is this unique colorful design? An FPS? Why am I using a keyboard and mouse!? It was after a few minutes of play I realized how much control I had over my aim and movement. It was hours upon hours of playing this PC with many unique games in a single day I realized all the flaws in **FILTHY**consoles. It was the day I wished to become part of the Master Race.

The cable management could be better, but I just wanted to finish this and get to bed when I built this two days ago. It has been running perfectly so far and have had no issues. I have only tried to play the new Tomb Raider on it so far and have been getting 50-55 fps on the highest graphics setting. I could not be happier with the end result and had a lot of fun putting this thing together. Let me know what you all think.:) I am obsessed with how much better gaming is on PC's and I thank you all so much!

Anyone that uses Steam Big Picture knows it's far from possible to rely completely on a controller. Game launcher's like [these](http://imgur.com/a/bfpi6), pop ups from other programs, error messages, etc. make me keep a wireless mouse within arms reach whenever I play in big picture. Game launchers that don't work with controllers are very very common in PC gaming, even with controller supported games. Any UPlay game, Arkham City/Asylum, Saints row III, GTA IV, Hitman Absolution, just to name some popular ones.

SO, what does this have to do with the DualShock 4? Well besides it being an all around fantastic controller, with similar button configuration to the 360 controller (most supported controller for PC gaming ATM), [The touchpad](http://imgur.com/0IrAFhk) could be used like a laptop trackpad, giving you a cursor to make your way around those pesky launchers, popups, etc. Of course it would take the proper software/drivers to allow your DS4 to function as a mouse AND gamepad. Sony could potentially sell thousands of controllers to people who will never own a PlayStation 4. Let's be honest though. Sony probably won't release the drivers and software to enable this. I realize this is a long shot so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that our wonderful dev community will realize this potential and make it happen!

1369810223.0	1f97e3	The relatively high barrier of entry to our PC Master Race is an extremely good thing.	Aerodamus	23	4	42	"As much as I would like to disagree with this opinion, I don't, and I know I don't based on my own personal experience. The barrier to entry was the hardest thing to overcome when I wanted to enter the world of high-end, nearly top-tier gaming, and I am thankful for that barrier. I know significantly more about computer hardware than I did before I joined this glorious and exclusive brotherhood. When I wanted to get into PC gaming a couple of years ago, I didn't know anything about hardware, so I started to research.


I pored over hardware information, reviews, videos, tutorials, guides, shopping tutorials, infinity Google searches, hardware introductions, benchmarking websites, countless benchmarking and performance comparison graphs, forums asking questions after question, for a couple hours almost every single day. I loved every single second of it. Every time I wanted to go play on my Xbox 360, I'd instead get on my shitty 2004 HP desktop and research PCs for a couple hours instead.


I learned more about computers in those two-three months of research than I did anything in my last two years of high school, and the thing is, even though many would consider it tedious, repetitive, and boring work, I could not have been more entertained. Because of that, I retained almost everything I read, something formal schooling has never been able to do for me.


One thing was for certain about 20% of the way through all that research. My original plan, to build a mid-range gaming PC that is better than a console, was out the window. My new plan was to build a high-end, borderline top-tier gaming machine that I would be proud of, and one that would blow consoles, even for a couple generations ahead, out of the water.


To do this I would need money, a lot of money that I didn't have at the time. But this end goal motivated me to go out and get a shitty evening shift warehouse job making $10/hour to help fund my new PC. After about six months at this job I finally had the funds to be able to do this.


At this point I pored back into the research game to configure the exact specs that I would want for my new PC. I already knew how to build it from all the research I had already done. In two weeks, all my parts had arrived. Nothing that I had ever done without other people had ever been more fun than putting that PC together and seeing is post successfully. When I loaded up my first game, and it automatically set me to ultra high quality, I was absolutely giddy.


The thing is, the whole process of going from an immature filthy console peasant to a member of the Glorious PC Master Race really made me a better person in the end. I have a newfound enjoyment and motivation for learning things that will make me a better person or make my life more fun and worth living. I have more confidence in my ability to set, maintain, and achieve goals. And best of all, I learned what it takes to buckle down and do what has to be done to get what I want, without anybody's help but my own.


So in the end, yes, you are 100% completely and inexplicably correct. The (actually) very high barrier to entry to a high-end gaming machine is a very, very good thing. I am not mad or disappointed that I had to spend so much time and money to get where I am now in the gaming world, I am grateful. I have an appreciation for this type of technology that I didn't have when I was a console peasant.


I realize now that this is much, much longer than I had ever intended to write, but your comment really struck home with me. I honestly don't believe PC gaming would be as great of a thing as it is if not for the entry barrier, and I hope it stays like this for quite some time. Console players who can't afford to build the machines may feel bitter now, I did, but they will understand in the end.

And then the lag claim. Like fuck bro, do you know what ping is? Just join a fucking nativenserver instead of an out of nation one you dip fuck. Sorry we don't have that shit known as matchmaking.

i started on﻿ ps3, played there for one year, then bought it to PC. in the start is was very cool, played there for almost a year, when i went back to ps3, i fucking loved it! now, i switch btw them both, still love the ps3 more. i must say that i liked that it was lesser players, lower framerate, lower graphics and all. i actually did it a lot better with 30 fps than 60fps. so i guess it's just taste. on pc, there was always a guy who fucked up for me so...



Like, alright dog, I guess playing completely inferior is more fun?

When I say it runs more smoothly I mean it's more consistent. On any computer there are occasional frame drops and﻿ lag, even the best computers do. On console I've never experienced any frame drops or lag.'

While he was at Best Buy, he heard two console peasants arguing about which is better: the PS3 or the XBOX 360.

""The PS3 has free online play.""

""The Xbox has an easily upgradeable HDD.""

""The PS3 has a Blu-Ray drive.""

""The Xbox has Halo.""

So, the young PC gamer approached them and said, ""My console has free online play, an easily upgradeable HDD, a Blu-Ray drive, and Halo. In addition to this, it has had Netflix since Netflix first started, superior graphics, very little load time, and more challenging games.""

In unison, the console peasants asked the PC King what console he has.  The PC Master replied, ""I have a PC. You should try it.""

The Xbox Peasant said, ""I don't think I can afford it.""

The PC Master said in reply, ""My rig costs $700 USD and gets free online play, sweet Steam sales, and no RRoD after the warrantee expires.  PC is cheaper.""

The PS3 peasant says, ""But controls!  How could one play with a keyboard and mouse?""

The PC Master then says, ""Keyboard and mouse is amazing for FPS's.  However, if you still prefer the controller, you can buy a Steel Series controller that is shaped nearly exactly like the PS3 controller.  Also, the Xbox controller works seamlessly with many games, in addition to Steam Big Picture.""

The console peasants were in awe. They asked the PC Master how such a thing is possible and how to join the PC Master Race.  The PC Master told them about Newegg and how GabeN himself sacrificed his job at Microsoft to bring vidya to the computer desk.  The next day, the peasants were no longer peasants: they had ascended to the Master Race.

After several years of one application, the compound may become baked onto your CPU/Heatsink, it's best not to let this happen. Below are instructions for doing this yourself:

1. Power down the PC including the switch on the power supply so capacitors aren't still holding a charge.
1. Remove the Heatsink.
1. Using the highest potency of isopropyl alcohol available (90% + for best evaporation) wet the end of a Q-Tip, not too saturated.
1. With the wet Q-Tip, swipe the top of the CPU to remove the old thermal compound, do the same for the bottom of the Heatsink.
1. Dab/Wipe both items with a paper towel or rag to remove any remaining alcohol or thermal crud.
1. Apply new compound on bottom of heatsink (Do NOT use excessive amounts) and spread with dry Q-Tip (The pressure of reapplying the heatsink will spread the compound out so just make sure you've applied it in areas to spread over the entire surface).
1. Reattach the heatsink.

Note: Compound like ""Arctic Silver"" contains aluminum for heat conductivity, but is also conductive for electricity. It is highly important not to use too much so that the compound is overflowing onto the motherboard, for if it does and conducts electricity over connections that aren't supposed to be connected, you may experience massive malfunctions and may even fry the motherboard. If this is something you worry about, a good alternative is thermal ""grease"". Any questions feel free to post a comment or shoot me a PM."	t5_2sgp1	True

They revel in their chains while slandering the freedom, power and love that is PC. Lo brothers, I have been a disciple of House PC since I could click a mouse and a servant of our Lord Gaben since he sat on his throne, not above us but among us.

With the guidance of the master race I shall awaken a force so powerful it will enlighten even those who surround themselves with darkness.

Months ago my plot began with a deal on the divine list of craigs, I knew my budget would either allow a cheap gpu and good specs or a good gpu and low end specs. The choice was obvious, upgradability. 

$440 later I acquired these specifications. Gigabytw x58a-ud3 mobo, Intel I7-950 (CM v8), 24gb RAM, 256gb SSD, 500 gb HDD and a faithful gts460 all enclosed in a Cooler Master HAF case powered by a Corsair 850watt PSU.

I have dubbed the monstrosity Cherno Alpha. He is old but is a brute who, with a few tweeks will become a brutal war machine again.

Now brothers, my ramblings shall cease. What in your humble opinion is the best 1440p Korean monitor under $400? Which gpu to max EVERY game in a resolution that peasants only dream of?

Hey there, Sister of PCMasterRace checking in here with a question concerning the state of the PC Gaming Notebook/Gaming Laptop in the state of the PC gaming industry today.

This questioning of the gaming laptop has always bothered and puzzeled me. I could have very well understood the distaste a long time ago when laptops were so severely underpowered that they couldn't do much for gaming, but now? They have graphics cards that are more powerful than previous fermi desktop cards, they have processors that are capable of workstation video editing.

They may not be power houses, but some of them are sheer titans of PC gaming, like the Asus G series laptops, the Alienware m17X and M18X, The Clevo NP9000 series, the MSI GT60 and GT70. All of the have graphics cards capable of dealing with 1080P gaming.

So I have much curiosity at the distaste towards these systems. 

Back Story:
I've been a PC gamer for a very very long time, pretty much all my life(Born in late winter of '90). I grew up on the Beige Box. I remember seeing Windows 3.1, I remember using Windows 95, I remember my first build used Windows 98, My wallpaper was Cardcaptor Sakura. It was an ugly old machine, but I remember the Turbo button on it and everything. My first real video games I played were Age of Empires and A10Cuba on windows 98.

I built computers as a teenager usually for other people because of neighbors and what not because my dad said I could it for them for cheaper(That man was a freaking asshole, he would bring me along to his networking jobs and make me make Ethernet cables and set up routers, shit he was suppose to do but made me do for free, hated it so much). My first windows xp machine was a Pentium III 500mhz. Boy that was a crappy build, I don't even remember the graphics card. It was old though. I didn't have money so it was cheap. :/

My first serious gaming build was an Intel Core 2 quad QX6850 Extreme, with a GT 8500. 4Gigs of Ram, windows XP, god it was an insane jump from that Pentium III 500mhz. I mean it was insane, but it was nice for the draught I had for years, and it was all on my own money.(I was a teenager at the time).
I eventually ended up getting in a dispute with my pops and I got kicked out. The machine was lost to me and I couldn't build, so I finally got the money from being the US army. 2009, I pick up an x58, i7 920, gtx 260. I loved that machine. It overclocked beautifully. Liquid Cooled. Then....  in 2012, Shit went bad for me. And yet again I lost my glorious desktop. at the time it was upgraded with a EVGA GTX570 1280MB and 12GB of Corsair Vengeance RAM. It ran every god damned game I could throw at it at 1080P without a hassle. I was so upset to lose it.

But I was wise about my situation and had picked up a little Alienware M11X for while I was out on Army duty back in early 2012.
It was a tiny little system that could handle league and WoW, and I could keep it in backpack without taking up much space. Was an epic little laptop that I still have and play on from time to time.
But I saw its value when I lost my desktop(I was discharged from the US Army for medical reasons, and I lost almost everything I owned because of the financial problems related to it). I was able to keep playing and then I got signed on a job with doing contract work with Google. This laptop got me a job and I was able to work again.
Literally this little 11inch laptop saved my life, if I had not gotten it I wouldn't be here today.


So I kept working and I ended up picking up a new Alienware m14X because I needed a quick cheap replacement with the same support that I had gotten before.
And this laptop is pretty good for its price.
i5 3210QM, GT650 GeForce 1GB GDDR5, 6GB 1600mhz RAM, 512GB SSD, 1600x900 screen, Intel Centrino 6250.($1250 including taxes and shipping)
It boots in 9 seconds, it plays even up to guild wars 2 on just below maxed(I wont put the shaders on high because I hate the way high shaders make the game models look on high, and super sample its too stressful on the GPU)

Guild Wars 2, at almost maxed graphics at 25~65FPS@900P, variates a lot because of the game's content. It has a backlit keyboard, a super bright screen, and I have never once seen this laptop hit above 67C in temps. And I've got MSI Afterburner overlays watching the GPU load and temps.
81~99% GPU load for a 5~6hours and its still hovering between 66 and 67. It handles well. I love how good this machine is.
Its compact. I can set it down, boot it up hook up my razer naga, plug it into a power source and be playing whatever game I feel like.
I've got a 4g wifi hotspot that I get just over 80ping with on league of legends.


Unfortunately the situation I live in now I can't build a desktop. I had the cash, and I wanted to drop it on an i7 3770K, HD7970 build, but unfortunately I cant keep a desktop where I am. So I pooled my cash and desided to pick up a $2000 laptop, with $200 of upgrades and $120 of artwork I used my graphics design skills for the back of the laptop lid.

Its a beautiful laptop that's coming together with the help of a laptop modifier/Desktop Builder(Xotic PC).(artwork and mSATA SSD and os installations and quality check burn in done by xotic, further modifications and upgrades done by myself)

i7 3630QM, AMD HD7970, 12GB 1866mhz DDR3, 2x60Gb SSD(mSATA one Boot, one 2.5inch Caching) 750GB 7200RPM HDD, 1080P 72% NTSC screen, Artic MX-2 thermal compound. 

This laptop out paces my old desktop in gaming power. Its absolutely gorgeous with my own custom artwork. 
Its not been delivered yet, but I know it will serve me for years without fail because of the power it harbors inside, but not only that I won't ever lose it. 
I've always had stability issues over the years and for me a laptop that can out pace the desktop I had back in early 2012... Its worth the extra cost and trouble especially when its got my own artwork on it and I'll never lose it as long as I keep it safe from being stolen.


Nowadays I'm absolutely obsessed with gaming notebooks/laptops. I love seeing a laptop pump up the graphics settings with their beautiful as a fucking goddess screen. I love seeing a laptop with a gaming mouse. I love the backlit keyboards and how beautiful they look in the dark... To see a glowing laptop with maxed out WoW or Guild Wars 2... Its such a glorious sight to be hold...
______________________________________________
 TL;DR
So here's the discussion I want to raise.
Why are the NoteBook/Laptop machines so looked down upon and down trodden for being Gaming Laptops?
Especially when they can handle modern games on high?


Some points to consider.
The Radeon HD7970M and GTX 680M both benchmark higher than P6000 on 3DMark11. Which is higher than the GTX 570 1280MB Reference designed graphics card offered in 2010~2012 for $360


That graphics card with an i7 Nehalem/sandybridge/ivybridge cpu @3.0ghz benchmarked at P5700 on 3dMark11.(Some people are even achieving P6700+ with the AMD HD7970M)
Which makes any laptop with a those top end cards more capable of 1080P gaming than desktops with the a GTX 560/570 ect.


Gaming laptops are very expensive. Mine was 2400$ final cost, I could have build a rig with a GTX 690 in it for that kind of cost. But the laptop does come with a built in 1080P screen, keyboard, speakers, can be unplugged for 4~7hours(If it has AMD Enduro or Nvidia Optimus and Ivybridge graphics), and it can be fit in a backpack or suit case complete with its power supply and gaming mouse+headset for under 17lbs/9KG(12lb laptop, 2lb power brick, mouse headset).

Run it in DX9

It might also be a steam only problem, But I cannot try the origin version right now as my HDD recently died and I do not have enough space on my SSD.

Does anyone here know of a solution to this *old* (2012 -_-) problem?

1371230744.0	1gclk7	My Conversation with an Xbox One Ambassador	spartan0228	17	2	9	"Last night, I went to the Man of Steel premier with a few friends. They're all console plebs, but they're tolerable. While we waited in line outside of the theater, the Xbox One came into conversation. We began to talk about how they were really going down the shitter. Then, the guy in front of us turns around and asks us about our problems with the Xbox One, and says that he works at Microsoft as an ambassador of the Xbox. I couldn't help but seize the opportunity and ask what reasons he could give me to buy the Xbox One when I already have a gaming computer that's miles better than the Xbox One. The only real reason he could give me was convenience, and when I told him how simple steam was, he just shrugged his shoulders. Either this guy was poorly trained, or Microsoft is starting to realize how much they suck.

TL;DR
Met an Xbox Ambassador, proved the Xbox useless in two questions.
