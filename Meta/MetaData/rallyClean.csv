I've been following Rallies around my province for 10 years or so. I started to be more serious with photography about 4 years ago, so the oldest pictures there were taken in 2008. I took an infinite number of pics during those years and I decided to take the best of them to show it to you guys. I did not use photoshop in any of the pics in this album because I ...just totally suck with that soft!
So enjoy!

Almost everyone who looked younger than 30 drove like a total douche, without any regard for law or even basic safety. 

People were passing me, briskly, on double solid yellow lines while I was doing ten over into blind curves.

I don't want to be that guy, but keep racing on the track. You are not David Higgins, Chris Duplessis, or Ken Block. You are a testosterone-laden twenty-something with too much horsepower and not enough brains.

Nobody is impressed by how idiotically you drive. On the contrary, and rather obviously, you look like idiots.

TL;DR Keep the racing to the racers and on the track. Your mom's Impreza is not a rally car.

I sincerely hope no one on [/r/rally](/r/rally) had anything to do with this behavior, but if you did you are bad and you should feel bad."	t5_2qy4s	True

Over the last few years the sport has seen a general decline in many aspects. This year is the worst for TV coverage. Bouncing around from station to station and when there is coverage most of it is crap from the picture quality to the announcers. It is a shame too that nothing is being done to balance the teams like the way F1 handled the Red Bull dominance situation.

Loeb is one of the best drivers to ever come into the sport and to me it seems like the FIA and WRC are doing a disservice to all the talented players by letting the sport wilt into obscurity."	t5_2qy4s	True

1362529473.0	19qqf5	I want to get into rally, but I'm on a budget. 	woofspider	24	4	42	"Hi, I'm an e30 325IX driver and I love the car a lot. I'm very familiar with it's handling, and am considering picking up an e30 318is for a rally car. I like it because it has a good weight distribution and weight. My plan for it would be to get it (duh); strip it down; reinforce the chassis, subframe frame and suspension; racing seats, and install coilovers.

When I get more money, I'll probably do the brakes and maybe cams and a turbo.

Does this sound like a reasonable plan? I'm trying to drift dirt, take small jumps and handle small rocks, possibly sideways.

I also have a few technical questions: 

-Where would you recommend reinforcing (other than strut braces and a roll cage?) 

-What would you do about beefing up the rear, semi trailing arm suspension? I'm thinking a stiffer spring and gas pressurized shocks for progressiveness, as I've read coilovers will punch out the shock tower. I also want to give the car a slight lift, especially in the front.

-Will slotted rotors be good enough or will I want all new brakes? I like the power of my current e30 brakes, and I'll mostly be doing dirt at less than 50mph (as I see it, but who knows!)

-Is the hydraulic handbrake worth it? E30 handbrakes are worthless for handbrake turns, but I've made up for that (I think anyway) with left foot braking.

Thanks!

BIG EDIT: 
I think it's important to state my intention. I've gotten a car 8 months ago. Took it to dirt track. Had a blast, but did a number on my car. Then started ice racing. Started horrible, but after 5 races I was in the top 10. I have the bug. Right now I'm looking to make what I see as a practice car. A beater that I can add to as my skills and finances improve, and maybe one day compete in.

Currently there are 66 entries.

If one plans to visit, Friday is VIP (paid) spectating only on Waste Management's property followed by a Super Special (also paid) at the Tioga country fairgrounds.  Saturday there are lots of spectator locations to choose from, but don't plan to hit more than one or two.  Parking tends to require a walk to the spectator area (bring a mountain bike to speed up the walk!)

And as /r/rally always encourages, volunteer!  Volunteers get free camping at the fairgrounds, can see racing on Friday, a free t-shirt, free entry into both super specials and a 5 dollar buffet Saturday after the rally.

Like some of you people on this sub reddit, you may have gotten up early or stayed up late depending on where you live (I live in California I was up at 7:30am) in hopes to watch some of the biggest names in X Games RallyCross go head to head in the Olympic Arena in Barcelona,Spain.  The first hour was canceled and they announced it over the GRCs Twitter page.  So I thought to myself ""ok thats fine I'll just watch some of the reruns.""  But they kept postponing it for one very stupid reason which still blows my mind - They didn't have the right tires.  Who the hell does not allow a rally car race to not have an extra set of tires that are for mud.  Instead they only allow them to have tarmac tires when 95% of the field is mud (dirt at one point).

Now, what I really want to see, and I think it would have been great for the sport, is to watch them go at it for a full year. VW vs. Citroen, Loeb vs. Ogier, etc. Tons of talent and a lot of money and development put into them. Everyone else is already and also-ran anyways. Ogier shot his mouth off the one season he was #2 at Citroen in a clash of egos (""Justice in the sport"" and all that); since VW entered this year he's been a wrecking ball. Almost 60 points between him and Mikko in second place after FOUR rallies??? Staying out of trouble and having luck on your side certainly helps, but its a torrid pace this early in the rally season.

JustLetMeComment	21	1	23	I have played the everloving crap out of Dirt 2 and Dirt 3, and am one of the last 25 or so people who still regularly play dirt 2 online. It's become boring. Either I get my ass kicked by the record-holders or it's a bunch of little kids.  I don't play 3 as much because, well, it doesn't have a soul like 2 does, and the lack of track/class mixing is very unwelcome. I prefer sim to semi-sim, and do not have access to WRC 2 or 3.

1. Classes are based on appraisal value
2. It's for fun, no one keeps track of score week to week (officially)
3. If, after a race a competitor offers to buy your car (for it's appraised value) you *have* to sell it to them. (You can buy their car too, this keeps people from getting to into it.)


How great would that be? 

Note, if this is a thing in north america already, please somebody let me know what it is called.

I just want to know what the basics are for getting into rallycross (other than knowing how to drive of course). The reason I'm asking so early is because the other day I was watching Top Gear, and it was the episode where James May travels to Finland to train with a pro driver (Mika Hakkinen). At the end, he enters one of the races that are held by locals. In the race, there are very young drivers, like 12 and 13 year olds. So if they can do that, why can't I? I just would really like some advice from someone who has some experience in rallycross. Like what cars are best in the long run, where I can find more info, and where the closest races are to me. I live in Reston, VA btw, and I don't mind driving 1 or 2 hours to a racetrack.	t5_2qy4s	True

I was just watching the highlights of WRC Catalunya 2011, and I noticed that almost all the top cars are two-door hatchbacks of some form (Fiestas, Minis, Citroen DS3s, etc) with the exception of a few Mitsu Evos.

My question is: What brought about this change in body styles? I know a few years ago the sport used to always be dominated by 4-door saloons, like Evos and WRXs. Are the two-door hatches somehow inherently better, or is it just a change in style, like fashion?

I also have noticed the Impreza has been introduced in the last few years in a hatchback style. Is this simply capitalizing on the current popular trend in rallying to please the consumer market, or was the change made to stay competitive in rallying?"	t5_2qy4s	True

Also LOVE Dirt 3, although I realize lots of people don't like it because it is too ""inbetween"" simulation-arcade. Anyways just looking for a place to watch full races, of rally and rallycross, especially the ones where you have people visibly racing each other. Like circuit racing, head 2 head. 


Also in the rallycross race I watched people were bumping n smashing into each other. But there were no penalties??? How is that fair? They can just bump you to the side and get ahead of you. Also some cars stalled, are they unable to start again?

This is the one I watched: http://youtu.be/0MnOSw5bOjU

I'm wondering how hard it would be to get around to all the stages on your own, considering they will be giving you an info pack with a map and all the stage locations.

On the other hand, the escorted tour gets you to a decent number of stages on all days including the shakedown, and you don't have to worry about timing or finding your way around a place you've never been before.

.

Their ideal car for the WRC would be the new [1.6L Hatchback Veloster](http://www.hyundai-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Hyundai-Veloster-2012.jpg). They have already developed a [rally version](http://blog.caranddriver.com/hyundai-releases-full-information-on-rmr-red-bull-veloster-rally-car/) of the Veloster that they plan to enter into Rallycross competitions, but with its 2L turbo'd engine, it is obviously not eligible for WRC entrance. But this just proves that they are in the performance spirit of wanting to make shit go fast.

.

As we all know, Hyundai would have to release a 1.6L Turbo version of the Veloster in order to homologate it for the WRC. Lo' and behold, it looks like [that's already in the works!](http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2013-hyundai-veloster-turbo-spy-photos-future-cars-car-and-driver). Another [article on that here](http://jalopnik.com/5848722/hyundai-veloster-turbos-exhausts-will-swallow-your-cat).

.

So, all signs point to a Hyundai WRC car sometime in the future, and this really makes me excited. I am seeing a renewed manufacturer interest in WRC and can't wait to see them all compete. Just last season it was just Ford and Citroën supporting WRC teams, but no we have BMW (Mini), Ford, Citroën, VW with a car on the way, and now seemingly Hyundai - How fun!

.

How do you guys think it'll compete? Do you think it'll even happen? If it does, will it get destroyed by the big guys, or will it run all over the competition?

.

Also, just to brag a little, I'm going to Ivor Wigham's European Rally school in December for a 2 day 1-on-1 course, and I'm so excited.

I'll be there and I know a couple other people on here will be as well.  If you've never heard of it before but live a couple hours away, come by and volunteer.  Rallies can always use more workers!
