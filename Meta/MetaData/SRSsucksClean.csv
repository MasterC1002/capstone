1352142227.0	12oj1r	Could SRS actually be a pedophile ring?	MarioAntoinette	423	88	132	"About a week ago, I jokingly made up a silly conspiracy theory which claimed SRS were actually child pornographers running a 'false flag' operation. I didn't really think it through, I just thought up the most outrageous thing I could think of and cooked up enough justification to make it funny. No big deal, just a throwaway joke.

But since then, in classic conspiracy theory fashion, that silly notion has started to prey on my mind and now I'm seeing evidence for it everywhere (yes, I know this is confirmation bias).

The following is a stream-of-consciousness collection of ideas which support this theory. Just for fun. Please don't think that this is some kind of realistic attempt to figure out the truth behind SRS.

* SRS has a policy of 'crying wolf' with accusations of child pornography and paedophile apologism. I'm fairly sure that most people who have seen them in action are less likely to believe similar accusations in the future.


* They also like to flood any tool that can be used to submit reports of child porography with false reports and divert resources meant to combat sexual abuse to harass people they don't like.


* They have planted CP to get sub-reddits they don't like shut down. Now, I don't have any CP and I'm not sure where you get it from, but I understand that it isn't terribly easy to find unless you spend a lot of effort looking for it.


* They do their best to promote unhealthy relationships between adults. I think it's quite possible that they are engaging in social engineering to make adults less able to handle complex, mature relationships with other adults in order to make relationships with children seem more viable. Encouraging the breakdown of families also helps raise more children who are socially isolated and deeply confused about sex... perfect victims for sexual predators.


* They constantly try to define terms such as 'pedophilia' and 'sexual abuse' as broadly and inconsistently as possible. Could this be an attempt to conflate things which society generally finds terrible with more socially acceptable behaviour and create confusion about where ethical boundaries should be drawn?


* They persecuted /u/violentacrez, who was one apparently of the most active moderators in removing child pornography from Reddit.


* They encourage the diversification and concealment of subreddits which may possibly attract child porn, making it far more likely that actual CP will be distributed.


* They maintain a large and secretive network of fake accounts, hidden communication channels and a culture of paranoia, hostility to outsiders and aggressive denial of wrongdoing. That's exactly what I would expect a community of paedophiles to look like.


* They are mostly white, twenty-something, males with poor social skills who are uncomfortable with their sexualities and feel a need to identify with uncommon labels, like 'demisexual' to explain their inability to handle adult relationships. That seems very much like the profile I would guess an 'average' paedophile would have.


* Most of them seem to have some form of personality disorder. Many of them are also mentally ill in other ways and apparently have difficulty interacting with others. That's not only the kind of person that is most likely to be a paedophile (I'm not saying that most mentally ill people are paedophiles, just that most paedophiles tend to have other problems), it's also the perfect target group for hunting victims in.


* They don't seem to care that everyone hates them or that they are dragging the reputation of social justice advocates through the mud. I think this could be a sign that being hated for what they seem to stand for is a lot better for them than being seen for what they really are.


* They are very keen to recruit children to their cause. They use deliberately childish memes, lots of immature humour with scatalogical and phallic themes, in-jokes and simple arguments which appeal to less mature people. They also idolise children and pander to young people's egos by suggesting that things like age-restrictions on voting are 'agist'. Most people who are concered with agism are equally worried about the prejudices old people face, but SRS seem to be entirely focused on children.


* I'm sure everyone has noticed how people who hate gays and denounce various 'perversions' often turn out to have been deep in the closet themselves. Those who are most paranoid about being discovered tend to be the most vocal about bashing their own group. I'd be deeply shocked if paedophiles were any different.


* They promote the idea that men who don't letch at adult women and don't seem comfortable displaying attaction openly are actually polite, female-friendly and trustworthy, rather than weird, creepy and suspicious.


* They rail against child pornography and sex with minors, but in a way which really seems like they don't appreciate the ethical reasoning behind those stances. Like someone parroting a line they have seen other people using without really getting it.


So, yeah. I hope that was entertaining. I'd like to see if anyone else has any 'evidence' of their own or would like to trot out their own crackpot theories.

EDIT: My original post made it into /r/SRSMythos, where absolutely nobody seemed to grasp the notion that it might be a joke. I think this is further evidence that I must have stumbled onto *the truth*, because actual SRS posters thought it was quite plausible someone would say that seriously. Of course, they all dismissed my theories as laughable, but the they would, wouldn't they?"	t5_2uuwv	True

I'm just throwing out an idea here. Hopefully some of you find this theory interesting; it's really the only one that makes sense to me.

As a young gay man, I used to be really homophobic. I would hate on gays to the point of irrationality, and it was mostly because I hated that part of myself. I vehemently denied that I was gay and often proclaimed how bad gay stuff was. I don't think all gay men go through this, but some do - I know I did. Fortunately, though, I came to terms with my sexuality, and now I'm proud of it :)

Perhaps SRS (and many other extreme feminists) is dealing with something similar. Deep down, especially when masturbating, they have a great desire to be a sex object. They want to be tied up, called a bitch/whore/slut, while some dominating masculine beast fucks them silly. They want to be forced to suck cock and be used as a cum dumpster. And various other demeaning, humiliating things.

They hate this part of themselves, and this is how they lash out. They go out and claim everything said about women is objectifying. [Even the mildest things](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1f8wxf/shes_beautiful_and_her_breasts_are_beautiful_85/). Imagine touching a homophobic gay guy's shoulder, and he lashes out at you: ""What are you, some kind of faggot?"". They're projecting their sexual fantasies on real life. There are two reasons for this behavior - it vindicates them in their hateful moments, and then later provides fuel for their masturbatory fantasies.

I think most women who have these kinds of fantasies come to terms with it. They can be found on [fetlife](http://www.fetlife.com/) enjoying every second of the demeaning, humiliating, hateful things that men are doing to them every day.

The slightest disagreement is enough to provoke them into falsely calling you a ""bigot"" or ""misogynist"" or  ""racist"" or ""rapist"" or a host of other very serious things that they throw out at the slightest provocation, just because they also record the no-contest examples of those things in their subreddit.

SRS (and tabloids) really really like decontextualizing because, with the addition of context, few quotes are as damning as one would expect.

In case you're worried about things like ""truth"" or ""facts"" or ""intellectual honesty"", let's start thinking like a typical SRS poster:

&gt; ""WHAT CONTEXT?!""

Exactly. Now you're in the frame of mind to learn.

###**I. ON THE LABEL ""CHILD"".**

&gt; Physiologically a child is anyone under 10-11. After that puberty starts and they're ""tweens"" or ""teens"", so calling a 17 year old ""child"" is misleading since most people will think of prepubescents.

This person has a solid point about [equivocation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation) between the legal and physiological definition of children. 

No matter. If you're thinking like an SRS poster you will pick up one key thing:

""anyone above 11 is not a child (because they are tweens/teens)""

I like to call this the Qualifier Chopper. Actually, I don't, because I just made that up. But I'm calling it from now on.

All that shit in parentheses? You can just remove it.

&gt; ""anyone above age 11 is not a child""

MUCH BETTER.

Now just add ""WTF"" after it to [prime (text version)](http://tinyurl.com/primingwikipedialink
) [(video version)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1OVhlRpwJc) the person into reading it with a ""this must be something bad"" frame beforehand.

&gt; redditor says anyone over 11 is not a child. [+20] what the FUCK""

PERFECT.

###**II. ON CREEPINESS.**

&gt; Having a big muscled man say ""I'M GONNA RAPE YOU"" is terrifying, not creepy.

This person has made his or her first fault by using the ""x but not y"" construction.

For any ""X but not Y"" construction, SRS will take advantage to read it as ""Not Y and not anything resembling Y."" Scariness is a tier above creepiness in fight-or-flight emotions, but things like *specificity* do not work to your advantage.

Let's do this. The phrase ""not creepy"" clearly exists in this person's sentence.  All we need to do is add a bit of interjections / exclamations like ""holy shit"" and ""what the fuck"" to do our priming work, and...

&gt; Holy FUCKING SHIT [TRIGGER WARNING] redditor says a big muscled man saying he's going to rape you isn't creepy. I'm at a loss for words.

NOW YOU'VE GOT IT!

###**III. ON EMOTIONAL APPEALS.**

Real talk: if someone tries to commit suicide, they are probably not using it as a talking point in an internet discussion because it's traumatic as hell.

But suppose you didn't actually ever try to commit suicide, yet you know you'll get a lot of oppression olympics street cred from saying  misogyny almost pushed you to it.

Say one time you got really drunk in a bathroom after your roommate made a series kitchen jokes and you knocked over some DayQuil pills. 

Assuming you're honest, the most you could say is ""my roommate's stupid kitchen jokes led me to getting really drunk last night.""

But you have an in here: the fact that DayQuil pills are still pills, and most people will not read ""pills"" and think ""pills that don't kill you"" or even ""pills you didn't take.""

Get ready to take a dump on context, and you get:

&gt; after my roommate made endless misogynistic remarks over the course of the night, I couldn't take it anymore. by the end of it, there were pills scattered across the bathroom floor. That's all I'm comfortable saying.

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMM, [X X X PRO NOSTEAM](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rulElJITIVY)

###**IV. ON HUMOR.**

Sometimes some jokes are funny because the persona of the person telling them is someone humble, meek, whatever. Sometimes they're funny because they reverse your expectations.

""What do you call a black guy flying a plane? A pilot, you racist.""

Funny as hell, because you expected a racist setup.

Now suppose you imagine FreeRepublic people telling this joke as a mockery of the *concept* of racism. Like, ""haha they think racism is real, how hilarious.""

Who would be so stupid? Imaginary people, obviously.

Imagine you think of every single person on Reddit like they're from FreeRepublic. Now, start reading it like all of the redditors are upvoting it because they think racism doesn't exist. If you're thinking ""but that's not why it's funny"", you're not thinking like an SRS poster.

With this in mind, make your SRS headline. OK, Go - Here It Goes Again.

&gt; joke on /r/funny: ""HAHA CASUAL RACISM IS SO HILARIOUS. IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE RACIST. [+500]""

fucking done, son. get on the floor and [walk the dinosaur](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYKupOsaJmk)

###**What is SRS?**

---

/r/ShitRedditSays is a subreddit (a subsection of the website reddit.com) dedicated to ""calling out"" what the subscribers to that subreddit think are bigoted comments. Their definition of 'bigoted' leans toward an ideological feminist definition, and so there will be a disconnect between what a normal person thinks is bigoted and what SRS thinks is bigoted. For example, [they have linked to someone for using the term ""vacation poon,""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/13ehki/i_havent_been_laid_in_like_6_months_and_im/) which would suggest they think the term is bigoted or objectionable. This sort of thing would strike a normal person as crass but not bigoted and not very offensive; terms like ""bigoted"" are usually reserved for something far more severe, like ""I don't want my daughter dating a black man."" [Read this if you'd like to know more about how SRS differs from the general population in words like ""bigoted"", ""racist"", ""sexist"" and so on.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/187v5w/srs_offensive_vs_normal_person_offensive_the/)

When SRS ""calls out"" a comment this usually means they will respond to it with extensive use of sarcastic tropes, and will enter the comment threads they're linking to in order to argue with the people making comments they disapprove of. Sometimes they don't enter the discussion and mock it from their own subreddit, but this is rare. The most common term for this kind of swarming is ""brigading"", and isn't specific to SRS; it refers to the combination of downvotes and arguing that happens when a subreddit invades another subreddit's discussion.

SRS was initially created by reddit_sux in a SomethingAwful.com thread and led by users Amrosorma, therealbarackobama and HPLovecraft. It no longer has anything to do with SomethingAwful, and the original team (according to SRS moderator ArchangelleGabrielle) no longer runs it.

---

###**Does SRS really believe what they say?**

---

The short answer is **yes**, they do believe what they're saying.

The long answer is that because they communicate mostly through sarcasm, what they believe is usually the opposite of what they're saying -- but *that* part, the view implied by the sarcasm, is what they really believe. So if we're discussing gun control and I say ""YEAH, IT TOTALLY MAKES SENSE TO LET CONVICTED CRIMINALS BUY GUNS"" the literal meaning is that I am pro-gun for criminals, and obviously I don't mean that, so you will have the impression that I believe some sort of background check is necessary for gun purchases. This paraphrasing of the opponent's position in mocking capital letters is a device I've called [sarcastic paraphrase](http://alfredmacdonald.com/2012/12/26/dissecting-the-frog-on-sarcastic-paraphrase/).

---

###**Are SRS just a bunch of trolls?**

---

This plays into the last question, but this largely depends on what you define ""troll"" to be, since this word has been diluted to mean everything from ""person who argues about something they don't believe in to get a reaction from you"" to ""person who argues a lot.""

If you take troll to mean that they don't believe what they say, then **no, they are not trolls.** While there are undoubtedly some people who do that lurking in SRS proper, the vast majority do not. It's tempting to believe that they *are* trolling because dismissing their arguments is a lot easier, but all evidence points to ""they legitimately believe what they're saying."" (Or at least, they legitimately believe what their sarcasm would imply.)

If you take a troll to mean ""people who argue a lot"", then sure.

---

###**Why do so many people dislike SRS?**

---

There is not a single identifying factor, but a number of things stand out.

There's the short list:

1. argumentation technique

2. etiquette policing

3. sensationalism

4. ad hominem

5. downvote brigades

6. non sequiturs

7. hypocrisy

8. no dissent

9. ideology

and the long list:

1. They argue a lot, and tend to argue via mockery and [sarcastic paraphrase](http://alfredmacdonald.com/2012/12/26/dissecting-the-frog-on-sarcastic-paraphrase/) rather than a direct address of your points. If you don't have time to read the link about sarcastic paraphrase, it goes something like this: if you were arguing that affirmative action isn't meritocratic, a direct counterargument might be something like ""the benefits outweigh the meritocratic losses."" A sarcastic paraphrase would be something like ""translation: I am a racist and am using 'meritocracy' as a cover for being a terrible person.""

2. Their practice of swarming comments they think are bigoted, in conjunction with the nonstandard, ideological way they define ""bigoted"", strikes most people as a kind of militant etiquette police. For example, most people would object to use of the word ""bitch"" because it is a rude swear word. SRS would too, but because it's a ""gendered slur"", and they regard it in a category similar to, but lesser than, racial slurs. By contrast, SRS would probably find ""shithead"" okay, while a normal person would find it a rude swear word in line with ""bitch."" [This thread is an elaboration on that kind of disconnect.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/187v5w/srs_offensive_vs_normal_person_offensive_the/)

3. They can be sensational about the things they are arguing and will frequently take their opponents out of context, so you have a sense that you need to rhetorically posture yourself in order to avoid being distorted. ([Here is an elaboration on how they would normally take something out of context.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/129kp5/how_to_decontextualize_like_youre_from_srs_a_guide/)) Further, if you say the wrong thing, the SRS poster can use that as a venue to post an *even more* exaggerated reaction, which is intended to paint you as a bad person. This emotional way of arguing strikes a hard contrast with the logical ideal that reddit professes to value.

4. Their method of attack is often ironically trait-based. In other words, ""I am a woman, you are not, so do not comment""; ""I am poor, you are not, do not comment""; ""I am black, you are not, do not comment."" Or the other way around: ""you are a man, which makes your argument invalid""; ""you are middle-class, which makes your argument invalid""; ""you are white, which makes your argument invalid."" While their method of arguing is never this explicit, this is frequently the implication of their sarcasm.

5. While they adamantly deny this, they will frequently downvote their opponents and, if brought up, mock this accusation by more sarcasm. (The standard reply is something like, ""my internet points! oh no!"") There is an important caveat to this however: SRS rarely votes on the top-level comments they link to. Instead, they will keep the original comment as-is, but upvote all of their own comments and downvote any comments that oppose their own comments. This effectively creates a structure where the top-level comment remains, but everything following it is completely dominated by SRS, giving their views the most possible publicity and creating the impression that their opinion is reddit's opinion, and the opinion native to that subreddit. This style of downvoting publicizes their disapproval as loudly as possible, and creates a kind of negative model: ""if you do what we disapprove of, *all* of these people will hate you and think you're a terrible person and mock you ruthlessly and publicly.""

6. In relation to #1, they will frequently use non sequiturs when engaged in serious argument. So you might see ""lol"", ""u mad"", ""go away"", or some other irrelevant reply if you respond to them. This is despite the fact that they clearly want their views to be accepted/taken seriously. If you push them to seriously elaborate on their views, they will do so with the attitude that it's a laborious effort and they're one step away from exiting the conversation. 

7. Many people perceive there to be rampant hypocrisies on part of SRS, especially given that there is no room for ideological variation due to their moderation policy. For example: SRS seems to hate reddit yet many of the users spend an inordinate amount of time on reddit; SRS seems to downplay internet discussion (e.g. ""lol internet points"") yet devotes an inordinate amount of time to gaming it; SRS advocates against double standards, yet is remarkably preferential to certain demographics over others.

8. Most famously, they have no tolerance for dissent in their subreddit. In their own terms, this is ""breaking the jerk"" or ""posting in bad faith."" To be fair, nearly all subreddits squash dissent in one way or another. SRS is notable for however for *extensive* use of bans for even minor break from their dominant view, even on subreddits like /r/SRSDiscussion which was initially posed as a way of seriously discussing what SRS believes -- a goal which was retracted after too many people posted ""in bad faith.""

9. Finally, there's their ideology itself. While they are openly feminist, they will neatly sum up their social views as being ""for equality"", which hardly captures all of what they believe. Virtually everyone agrees that rape is a horrible act, for example. But SRS believes that if you have sex with someone drunk, you have raped them because they believe that person cannot consent while drunk. Most people imagine far worse when they think of the word 'rape', and this is due to their ideology's definition of the term. The foundation of their dominant view is The Patriarchy, which is an overarching societal theory that they adopt to explain oppression as they see it. Through this theory, men can be sexist to women but women cannot be sexist to men. Most people, upon finding out about this theory and their broad definitions of words like 'rape', object to their ideological quirks. (Note: this hardly covers every aspect of their ideology.

###**But isn't SRS just satire?**

---

Do not take ""satire"" to mean ""I don't believe what I'm saying.""

The Daily Show is satire, but it's obviously advancing a liberal viewpoint. Some jokes, like puns or slapstick, might be pure comedy, in the sense that their comedy is derived purely from wordplay or delivery. Satire isn't. Satire contains, at the very least, some viewpoint of the satirist in the comedy itself.

[This cartoon is satire.](http://i.imgur.com/R1RtV3i.png) It is also obviously argumentative: a criticism of some perceived redefining of facts by the state.

What they are writing may be satirical, but that doesn't mean they don't believe what is implied by their satire.

---

###**Why did you write this?**

---

I've seen these questions brought up too many times and usually find the answers to be either factually wrong (""it's satire so they don't believe it"") or far too flattering to SRS. Hopefully, this will clear some things up for those who haven't been exposed to them for very long."	t5_2uuwv	True

For those of us that got to watch it happen in real time, well, it was a fun few days for sure.

So without furthur ado... here we go.

[William Shatner joins Reddit by saying hello to r/StarTrek.  The fans come out in full force.](http://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1818um/someone_said_i_havent_said_hello_to_rstartrek_yet/) {As a quick side note, Shatner had actually begun posting a few days prior, but no one had really picked up that it was the real William Shatner until he made this post.}

As hordes of fans clog his inbox with comment replies and Private Messages, Shatner becomes overwhelmed.  Sticking only to /r/StarTrek and /r/StarWars, Shatner decides he needs to lay out some ground rules on interacting with him.  [He makes this post in r/StarTrek with 3 simple guidlines. The 3rd guideline discussing how his posting in certain places or replying to certain things could be construed as an endorsement and he wouldn't do it without that place being fully vetted. SRS failed to recognize this message and it would prove to be their undoing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/184dmp/shatner_rules_on_reddit_if_i_may_offer_up_some/c8bhlaq)

In the comments he is given some tips about dealing with his overflowed inbox [including this post which suggests he take his recommendation that private messages be ""switched off"" to /r/ideasfortheadmins](http://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/184dmp/shatner_rules_on_reddit_if_i_may_offer_up_some/c8bm8ow).

Shatner follows that particular piece of advice and takes his request to /r/ideasfortheadmins where he makes [this request that there be a way to ""turn off"" private messages to help reduce the overflow in his inbox.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/)

Up to this point, Shatner has been pretty amazing with handling people and interacting with the hordes of fans.  He posts frequently and seems to make an earnest attempt to respond sincerely to people.  He is getting to know Reddit and Redditors, commenting that he visits some of the main subs like /r/IAMA and /r/TIL.  Suffice it to say, William Shatner is taking an unguided safari through the Wilds of Reddit.

And that's when it happens.

/u/radii314 says: [Bill, you mentioned some of the unsavory aspects of Reddit in an early post somewhere ... I hope you know there is a Dada aspect to this place with the absurd, weird, offensive and strange just chiming in from left field from time-to-time ... there is much of interest to mine here but some bad neighborhoods too
](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/c8bo3t4)

Shatner responds with this:

[The unsavory aspects still exist - I am apalled by some of the immature, horrifically racist, sexist, homophobic, ethnic... etc.. posts that are just ignored here. Why are these accounts still active? While Reddit has done well in getting interest from the mainstream I just wonder if by allowing these children to run rampant and post whatever they feel will cause the most collateral damage if Reddit is biting off it's own nose in taking that step to become a mainstream community.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/c8bocrt)


[That being said, I'm still new here. That's been my observation in my short time here and I could be wrong. MBB](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/c8bocrt)

This simple message from Shatner is what SRS would *want* you to believe they are all about.  They would then be quick to take his words and run with them as fast and as hard as possible.

/u/ArchangelleDworkin is the first SRSer to respond to him by saying: [That's what I've been trying to tell the admins for years and they won't listen.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/c8bucf5)

[It took us 6 years just to get them to delete the child porn that was on the front pages, but its still everywhere on the site](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/c8bucf5)

[It then gets linked over to /r/ShitRedditSays where they jerk themselves into an absolute frenzy, twisting Shatner's words into validation for their little club.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/c8bocrt?context=2)

Some SRSers even chime in to reply to their new hero William Shatner.

/u/danaofdoom: [You know, Mr. Shatner, I think I've underestimated you. I know it's basically blasphemy to admit this, but my whole life, William Shatner was a guy from a TV show my dad watches. But from what I've seen of you on Reddit, you seem to be a pretty cool person. 
](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/c8bviiq)

/u/TheIdesofLight: [Thiiiiiiiiiiiis is why I love you, love everything you've done, love Star Trek, love love love and some more love dear god the love yessssss &lt;33333](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/c8bux58)

And one particularly delusional SRSer /u/blueorpheus decides that hey, maybe William freaking Shatner, who had just said he doesn't like some of the appalling things he sees on Reddit, would love to enter the land of giant stupid image macros, odd pictures featuring dildos, and a language style so convoluted it takes 2 years on Tumblr and at least 3 gold medals from the Oppression Olympics to understand even half of it.... and he hilariously *invites William Shatner to come hang out at SRS*: [You should check out /r/shitredditsays! It's a subreddit dedicated to calling out all the racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise bigoted stuff that is highly up voted on reddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/c8bwqg8)

Meanwhile, SRS had plastered Shatner's face on their sub and started milking his comment for all that it was worth.  They hadn't bothered to follow up with Mr. Shatner, [who was responding to other Redditors about his comment which was actually referring to Reddiquette on a whole,](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/c8cb06w) not their version of the shit reddit says.  This would prove to be a giant OOPSIE!

Back in SRSsucks, /u/MittRomneysCampaign confronted this distinction between Mr. Shatner's comments and SRS's perception of it with this post: [SRS ""Offensive"" vs. Normal Person ""Offensive"": the William Shatner Story](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/187v5w/srs_offensive_vs_normal_person_offensive_the/)

As the Fempire's adoration grew their celebration reached a deafening swell.  Foolishly, and with an extreme lack of self awareness, they had used Shatner's words to try and insulate themselves from their detractors.  The circlejerk and Shatner worship would continue on without a shadow of concern for the impending doom.

A day passed...and then this...

Shatner steadied his sniper rifle and let his breathing slow to match his heartbeat.  He trained the cross hairs on the space directly between the big blue bird's eyes.  Without a moment's hesitation, with no regret or concern for the life he was about to end, he squeezed the trigger.  Before the blue beast could hit the earth, the Fempire went silent.

Shatner had been made aware of Shit Reddit Says, and as per his 3rd guideline listed above checked it out.  To no one outside of the Fempire's surprise, he would not want to be associated with SRS.  He then made this comment distancing himself from their toxic subreddit:

[Could I ask that you send a message over to whomever runs SRS? I would like the banner removed. I do not feel it's appropriate and I am not a member there. Thanks. MBB](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/c8cqsgw)

The only response from the Fempire was a defeated whimper from ArchAngelleGabrielle:

[It's really cool that Shatner's speaking up about this; I can totally understand why SRS isn't his style.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSMeta/comments/189rkc/theverge_article_summarizing_shatner_vs_reddit/c8cvoy7)


[There are lots of ways to approach making the world a better place, even when it comes to something as seemingly insignificant as an online community.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSMeta/comments/189rkc/theverge_article_summarizing_shatner_vs_reddit/c8cvoy7)

The fun was over.  The celebrity that had spoken about the appalling things he saw on Reddit had stopped in to ShitRedditSays and found it just as appalling.  The members of the Fempire thought they had found a hero in Bill Shatner, but their toxic ideology and hypocritical standards had turned him away.  It was now time to go back to the only thing they were any good at; the arduous task of berating people in r/AdviceAnimals.

And so goes the story of when William Shatner came to Reddit, spoke out about people's shitty behavior, and then told SRS to stuff it.  Thank you for reading."	t5_2uuwv	True

(important parts in bold)

&gt; Dear (name redacted)

&gt; The President has asked me to respond to your letter dated December 5, 2012. We do not have sufficient information to comment on the specifics of this incident, nor, obviously, do we take any institutional position on the merits of the arguments presented by this or any other group that airs its ideas on our campuses. What we can assert is our general view of free speech on our campuses. We believe a university campus is a place where difficult questions are asked and controversial discussions are conducted. It is also a place where freedom of speech, within the bounds of the law, must be respected. There are often significant challenges when speech is perceived to be offensive. On these occasions, the role of the administration is both to remind organizers of events that they must be mindful of the impact on others of the exercise of their freedom of speech, and to remind those who are offended by the content of that speech for the need for civility and respect in these discussions. **We deplore disruption of events by protesters and physical intimidation of presenters and their audiences. The vast majority of the University of Toronto community understands that freedom of expression is vital to the mission of universities and cannot be reserved for those with whom one agrees. Indeed, it is heartening to see that much of the commentary around the event to which you refer seeks to engage the issues themselves, while recognizing the right to freedom of expression. We will continue to work with all members of our community to promote this way of approaching controversial issues and events.**

&gt; Best Regards, (name redacted)

**second:**

Sun News Network has started covering the protest. They will be doing an interview with Warren Farrell on December 6th 8PM eastern time on ""Michael Coren's The Arena"" segment, as a result of the the video.

http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/video/featured/news/868018287001/prime-time-preview-december-6/2016593084001

Sun News actually has some pretty interesting stuff, but if you wish to skip to the Warren Farrell part it starts at 1:40.

This will only make the coverage of the protest bigger.

I PM'd an admin, who told me there were ""pretty sure"" it wasn't SRS, and ceased responding to me when I asked them how they knew it wasn't SRS.

Next, I had a fake account made that sent me a PM that I ignored because I have better things to do than entertain them.

Now, I have a user I have tagged as SRS (http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/1honv9/woman_jailed_for_false_rape_accusation_srs/cax29km) popping in with the same type of bullshit out of the blue.

The admins clearly aren't going to be any help to me given that the admin tried to absolve SRS of guilt the first time and ignored me request for how they knew it wasn't an SRSer... but now I have a tagged SRSer repeating this stuff, so either it's all this person (in which case the admin clearly lied that it wasn't) or SRS is talking about me off-site or privately;  What do I do?

Their information is essentially wrong (I won't say how so, no need to help them when they're failing), it seems now they're just coming through my post history looking anything personal to try to use.
I blocked Xir again. I'm assuming it's a he because the writing is more ""angry masculine"" in tone.
This is literally the face of feminist activism. THIS IS how feminist do activism. It's kind of pathetic.

According to feminists who totally don't have a rape fetish, this was a joke referring to having sex with a woman without their consent. Freud would have a field day with these people....

SynisterBaconLord	180	44	210	"When I first came upon this sub, I joined simply because I was tired of the brigade machine cunting up the front page posts. Over time, however, the longer I've dealt with them I've become weary of the entire concept of feminism. Hell, I've become weary of just posting on Reddit in general, they've made me enjoy Reddit less with their BS. So I step away from srss for a little while, just lurking around and trying my best to just avoid thinking about them, but of course I'd come upon them, again, derailing threads in the front page. From the get go of my joining this sub I've held that this was not political for me, this was just practical; I like Reddit the way it is, they want to change it, therefore fuck them. Now though, I see more and more of mainstream feminists use their lingo and logic, generally fail at arguing and whatnot and more recently, Arnita trying to take a shit on my games without knowing a fucking thing about them, you know what? Fuck it. I hate feminism now, and I hate feminists. I will probably make some sort of conscious effort to fight it now, because they have made me aware of just how vile it is.

FistFuck	150	24	56	"I know there are a few things to call them and their beliefs. I've seen 'feminist' and 'hyper-feminist'.

Those names are great if you already know what they mean, but most people (myself included) don't know the waves of feminism, and don't know the feminism types with the hyphenated names.  I think that in the wider world those permutations may seem too complicated for the average person to bother with.  

In any case it fractures the distant view of them into artificially small groups, when they're really quite a horde, and their high membership numbers are one of the primary facts that we should hope to convey.

I believe that if we were to refer to them as female supremacists wherever possible, we would more effectively spread the word about their evil shit.  The 'X supremacist' form conveys a perfect understanding of their beliefs.  It also frames them in the proper context as dangerous and hateful ideologues.

1360452945.0	187v5w	"SRS ""Offensive"" vs. Normal Person ""Offensive"": the William Shatner Story"	MittRomneysCampaign	177	59	87	"If you haven't heard yet, William Shatner went to /r/ideasfortheadmins and posted the following:

&gt; The unsavory aspects still exist - I am apalled by some of the immature, horrifically racist, sexist, homophobic, ethnic... etc.. posts that are just ignored here. Why are these accounts still active? While Reddit has done well in getting interest from the mainstream I just wonder if by allowing these children to run rampant and post whatever they feel will cause the most collateral damage if Reddit is biting off it's own nose in taking that step to become a mainstream community.

Shatner posted [a tweet](https://twitter.com/WilliamShatner/status/299284069592731649) which seems to corroborate that this is indeed his position on reddit.

SRS was quick to salivate over this and post Shatner as the banner of their subreddit. This is, of course, absurd. /u/spaceball summarizes this well:

&gt; Yeah, I'm sure Bill can't wait to join you in your radfem sub full of dildo pics and unintelligible made-up language. But he's one of you because he saw something he didn't like on reddit.

Shatner does not resemble a social justice warrior in any way; he does not believe even a quarter of the things SRS believes. He does not treat women badly, but to SRS, he would ""objectify women"", he would be ""cisprivileged"", and would probably ""reinforce the current power structure / the patriarchy.""

SRS has been doing this for a while. When the creepshots/jailbait drama happened, they courted the soccer mom demographic's inherent fear of sexual predators and used that to slander reddit. Even though these mothers and readers are likely to be social moderates if not social conservatives, SRS either assumed they would just *agree* with their fringe ideology wholesale or, perhaps, they didn't care either way.

But William Shatner could not be farther from an SRS poster. He probably does not believe in their idea of humor  ""trivializing"" their subject matter. He probably does not believe in rape culture, or patriarchy, or in the ""male gaze"", or in their [flawed application of gaslighting](http://alfredmacdonald.com/2012/11/07/gaslighting-what-it-isnt/), or in their view that women can't be sexist or that minorities can't be racist. There is a gulf of difference between **finding things offensive** -- between **normal person offended** -- and SRS.

When a normal person says reddit is ""hateful"", they mean something like:

&gt; You are a fucking idiot

or

&gt; [""I'd shoot her in the mouth""](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/186qcv/what_kurt_cobains_daughter_looks_like_now/c8c3dvl)

When SRS says reddit is ""hateful"", they mean something like MRA positions:

&gt; [""The judicial system gives (wives) carte blanche to destroy the lives of their husbands if they wish to.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1875qu/its_not_vindictiveness_its_just_power_the/)

When a normal person says reddit is sexist or misogynist, they are referring to comments like:

&gt; Women are friendzoning bitches

When SRS says a person is sexist/misogynist, they are referring to comments like:

&gt; [""they nerfed her tits""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/187jcr/from_rleagueoflegends_on_a_champions_new_splash/) or [""Attractive people (x100 for women) are treated better in all aspects of life. Everything from career to personal relationships to even small mundane things. It is known.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/183a4q/attractive_people_x100_for_women_are_treated/)

When a normal person says something is racist, they are referring to comments like:

&gt; [""Where do those feminists and niggers get off with all this fucking hypocrisy? They should know their place and apologize to everyone whenever their kind gets an unfair advantage that hurts the rest of us.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/181nvz/where_do_those_feminists_and_niggers_get_off_with/)

When SRS says something is racist, they include the above, but they are also referring to comments like:

&gt; [""Affirmative action is, by definition, racism.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/ykahp/affirmative_action_is_by_definition_racism_18/)

And when a normal person says something is bigoted, they mean something like

&gt; ""No daughter of mine is dating a black man""

When an SRS person says something is bigoted, they mean something like

&gt; [""everything even slightly negative against any one women is an attack on all women on reddit. This site is the biggest feminist circlejerk""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/rbyd9/everything_even_slightly_negative_against_any_one/)

---

(side note: I find SRS's current headline about how it wants reddit to become ""mainstream"" oddly hypocritical. Mainstream is the status quo / the current power structure. Feminism's goal is to *subvert* the current power structure. So if ArchangelleDworkin wants reddit to become mainstream, her goal is more in line with social conservatism than feminism.)

---

SRS has some success because a small fraction -- say, 10% -- of what SRS finds offensive also overlaps with what normal people find offensive. Reddit happens to tolerate that 10% of comments, so normal people can look at reddit and agree with SRS's conclusion, not knowing that SRS's definitions go *far deeper* than what a normal person thinks is offensive.

They have some success because their definitions are intentionally broad for the purposes of misleading. They say ""I am against racism, homophobia, and sexism"" because they know that an outsider will read these things and say ""yes, so am I!"" -- They don't qualify what their definitions are, and they don't make it clear that they are using a nonstandard definition of these words.

Let's be clear: normal people **do not** have definitions of racism, sexism, and homophobia like SRS's definitions. Social justice forum posters are in the business of professionally being offended, and they have worked out elaborate views of social systems that are easily violated so that they can see offense as much as possible.

SRS retains these definitions as a power move: it allows them to temporarily side with normal people who don't know any better, who will then support them, and so to break even with normal people the powers-that-be on reddit must give SRS some power in exchange. Wrongly, a person in power on reddit may assume that SRS is more in-tune with what normal people find offensive and give a person sympathetic to SRS carte blanche to decide what is and is not offensive, which is (partially) what happened on AntiSRS and what happens where a social justice person entrenches themselves in a community, says that the moderators do not address social justice issues, and creates a situation where it's cognitively easier to mod the social justice person than to figure out how address social justice issues independent of consulting with that person.

There is very much Normal Person Offended, and then there is SRS Offended. They are not the same thing. ""I am against racism, sexism, and homophobia"" means something very different to your boss, or your mother, or the average college crowd than it does to SRS. **They know** that regular people do not share their definitions, but they use them anyway hoping to mislead. This strikes me as [equivocation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation), which can be a logical fallacy. It's certainly dishonest, at any rate.

Shatner may side with the 10% of what SRS finds offensive, but then so would most people. He was reading ""cruel comments"" like a normal person would, not like an SRS poster would. The other 90% of what SRS believes is just as alien to Shatner as it is to anyone else, and very few celebrities who have extended exposure to SRS would agree with them. To have him on the banner of SRS is ridiculous, because he's *far* from agreeing with even a quarter of what they believe.

Alright so *simply* pointing out that the Duke Lacrosse team was falsely accused of rape counts as, what, sexism?

Do not warn people about the red flags which indicate that a woman may accuse you of rape. That is misogyny:

When someone shows up to inform a woman (who had previously thought she was having consensual sex) who cheated on her boyfriend that she was actually raped, you'd better agree:

Do not try to counter the rape culture. Only SRS is allowed to do that. Or, perhaps, I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps SRS thinks that weird people should be called rapists:

Double whammy. Guy catches his girlfriend poking holes in their condoms. Someone suggests that he tape the inevitable conversation in case she decides to lie about being beaten or raped later. But SRS has a problem with this... because spermjacking doesn't happen as often as false rape claims don't happen:

False rape accusations can't be part of rape culture. Only what SRS decides is rape culture is rape culture. I don't know what kind of bigot this person is classified as. Or what kind of bully. I'm confus. You know what's funny is that I'm starting to understand why SRSters think there's such thing as rape culture at all. It's because they talk about rape All. The. Time. [TW]:

We all heard this story. Remember that poor kid that played high school football and then went to prison for 5 years for a rape he didn't commit? And his accuser got $1.5 million? Well he plead guilty to the charge because he was (correctly) informed that people had been convicted with less evidence and that he should go for a plea bargain. So someone suggested that we make it harder to convict someone in order to cut down on miscarriages of justice. Well fuck people who want higher standards for conviction. They're bullies and bigots. By the way, this is also an answer to the often heard SRSQuestion, ""why would there be more false accusations of rape than any other crime?"" Because you can completely ruin someone's life simply by making the accusation and you can also get 1.5 million dollars as well as what amounts to immunity to prosecution. *My* question is, ""why isn't the false rape accusation rate even higher than it already is?"" Well, maybe the rate is higher than we think given the low standard of evidence...

http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1br4vw/when_the_standard_of_evidence_required_to_convict/

http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/6656/7845

In a similar vein, the belief that false rape accusers deserve punishment is sexist. We live in a society where the punishment is supposed to fit the crime. If you send an innocent person to prison for 10 years, what more fitting punishment could there be then being sentenced, yourself, to 10 years in prison?

This is a kind of funny one. In regards to that story about a woman killing a guy who she says raped her, some non-SRSter in the original thread wanted to make sure that people don't doubt the woman's story. Blueorpheus takes that comment out of context in order to make it seem like the commentator was saying that there's a possibility that the woman *wasn't* raped. SRSters then trip over themselves to correct the confusion without breaking the jerk:

http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/6658/7847

Do you think it's wrong to falsely accuse someone of rape? Do you think that false rape accusations make it harder to prosecute people for actual rape? Then you are a bully and a bigot:

http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/6659/7848

To finish off, a submission from the SRSter du jour who believes it's SRSMythos worthy to showcase a redditor for expressing the opinion that SRS demonizes people for being rapists when they are not actually rapists. I wonder how anyone could have developed an opinion like that:

Churches and other non-Islamic religious buildings and any organized, public, or even private worship of these religions is illegal, and any conversion from Islam is punishable by death ^[[3]](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2010/148843.htm) . In Iran, the followers of the Baha'i' religion are systematically oppressed in a myriad of ways, and frequent extrajudicial executions have been alleged, you can read a well cited article [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_Iran#Bah.C3.A1.27.C3.ADs). often times discrimination will be very gendered. in Pakistan marital rape is not a crime, while extramarital sex, gambling, and alcohol and property offenses are illegal through Islamic law, which is applied without distinction to Muslims and non-Muslims. Additionally the testimony of women is not allowed in court for these cases, nor is the testimony of non-Muslims if the victim is not also non-Muslim. In Iran, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the UAE, Yemen, and 12 Islamic provinces of Nigeria, homosexuality carries the death penalty ^[[5]](http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/1111) . 

There are innumerable ways in which Islamic systems have oppressed people in real and demonstrable ways, from legally enforced restrictions during Ramadan to muslims, non-muslims, and buisnesses alike ^[[6]](http://jonathanturley.org/2012/07/20/saudi-government-warns-non-muslims-to-observe-ramadan-restrictions/) to citizenship and due process ^[[7]](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3571835.ece), to even more specific abuses which violate SRS's most fundamental sensibilities such as restrictions on dress ^[[8]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map3.10RequiredDressCodesforWomen_compressed.jpg) (not all would recognize this as oppressive, but SRS views all expectations of what a women should wear as sexist ^[[9]](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/u2xou/women_if_you_wear_a_top_like_this_and_are_this/) ^[[10]](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/18n1ko/why_would_a_girl_wear_yoga_pants_with_words_on/) ^[[11]](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1931qw/who_the_hell_wears_a_black_thong_with_white_pants/) ^[[12]](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/15l1js/i_see_all_these_comments_of_women_shouldnt_have/) ^[[13]](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/16qot6/girls_of_reddit_do_you_know_guys_stare_at_your/) , never mind that these are legally enforced), or the aforementioned homophobia and GSM discrimination.



So when there are **real** systems of oppression in this world, systems that are truly and intentionally disparaging women and (immigrants/religious) minorities, can we expect SRS to bash Islam for its treatment of women as it bashes whites, men, and the neurotypical for their crimes of having too much privilege and having the audacity to want to raise their own children ^[[14]](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1824rg/bravery_postdad_must_pay_child_support_for_3_kids/) ? 

The answer is **no**.


SRS prime rushes to the defense of what it deems islamophobia ^[[15]](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/pobei/modest_effortpost_rathiesm_roundup_muslims_edition/) ^[[16]](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/101r3q/effortress_ratheism_returns_in_another_episode_of/)  ^[[17]](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/19fm80/you_could_have_a_subreddit_for_the_horrible_shit/)  ^[[18]](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/103ben/lets_play_another_round_of_one_of_our_favorite/) ^[[19]](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/s7rnf/shittyeffortpost_ratheism_has_grown_tired_of/) ^[[20]](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/search?q=muslim&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) , notice the distinct lack of Islamic criticism or weighing in Islamic customs vs. western demonization; but hey, I guess it is too much to expect SRSprime to not be one sided

So let’s head over to SRSdiscussion, where it turns out, the topic is woefully under-represented. A simple search for the word Islam reveals 14 topics, and a search for the term Muslim reveals 22 topics.  If we narrow it down to threads that are actually about Islam, not ones that simply mention it, the list is condensed even more, with no entries newer than 4 months old. ^[[21]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/search?q=islam&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) ^[[22]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/search?q=muslim&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)

Let’s examine the way they address Islam in these threads.

Their most common line of attack is, as usual, fallacious, this time taking the form of a tu quoque, stating that while Islam could possibly be misogynistic, other religions, specifically that Abrahamic, are also misogynistic.  ^[[23]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/z2i2y/islam_and_social_justice/c60wc7a)  ^[[24]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/11wek4/is_islam_misogynistic_essay_from_slate/c6qj2qd)  ^[[25]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/11wek4/is_islam_misogynistic_essay_from_slate/c6q78oy) ^[[26]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/104f7s/this_was_posted_in_srs_recently_ive_always_had/c6aujdt) . As one SRSter states “Yes, but Christianity is also. And so is Judaism. And so all are the minor Abrahamic religions, along with all the major non-Abrahamic religions. To single out Islam in particular as misogynistic is not only not useful, and racist, but also excuses all those other religions' misogyny.” ^[[27]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/11wek4/is_islam_misogynistic_essay_from_slate/c6qdwyu) Yes, because we all know how keen srsters are to talk about the misogyny in Judaism  ^[[28]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/search?q=judaism&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) . I don’t even understand the comparison. Maybe on a theoretical level it is true, but in actual reality countries predominantly Christian or even founded with Christianity inscribed in their government and legislature do not have any of the same abuses I have detailed above.


Additionally we can see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/104f7s/this_was_posted_in_srs_recently_ive_always_had/c6aml1n?context=2) that suggesting that one group might commit crimes against another group is a racist idea.
Another line of attack is the conjecture that all criticism of Islam is done by racists to secretly advance their racist ideology. ^[[29]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/vm777/how_do_you_distinguish_between_islamophobia_and/c55t6s5) ^[[30]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/pr2bl/islam_and_the_veil_sexism_misogyny_patriarchy/c3roplk) ^[[31]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/11wek4/is_islam_misogynistic_essay_from_slate/c6qjkkw)


We can also note that SRS seems to understand all criticism of Islam as directed at the followers of Islam, and not at Islamic society, something SRS should be good at since they claim their bigoted hatred isn’t aimed at men, or whites, but at male/white society.


So in conclusion, let’s understand SRS doesn’t care about stopping real sexism and oppression. They are just a group of bitter neurodiverse individuals who want to hate western white men. ^[[32]](http://i.imgur.com/z01Ik.jpg)

1357426664.0	1612vu	It's OK to call SRS people and tumblr feminists out on being socially inept.	MittRomneysCampaign	139	30	47	"As a guy, much of my teenage years were spent catching up to the girls, socially-speaking. I'd wager most men here have felt this way -- that the girls knew more about what was going on, socially, than they did.

Many of us are not teenagers anymore, though. We're adults with responsibilities and such and have adjusted ourselves accordingly.

Whenever I read something posted by someone on SRS, I tend to think they're like the people I know IRL. Which is to say, I know surprisingly few SRS-like people IRL, so I tend to extrapolate from the behaviors of people I know who write most like them when imagining what they're like to be around.

However, SRSWomen and SRSMicroaggressions are filled with examples of how SRS people live on a day-to-day basis. Further, we can get an idea of how they'd **like to** behave, ideally, IRL based on what tumblr public figures they express support for. And from these examples, I'm starting to realize that they are nothing like the people I know IRL. They are **weird.** Extremely so.

[This picture was the game-changer for me.](http://i.imgur.com/N9l1V.jpg) I don't have a ton of facebook friends -- only around 350 -- but if I showed this to virtually anyone I know on there, the obvious and unanimous reaction would be: ""haha he's trying to sleep on his girlfriend's butt."" But when SRS heard that the guy was awake for 20 minutes, instead of thinking ""he must be trying to get to sleep,"" they assumed *sexual assault* was more likely.

I can't think of a single person I know who would react that way. It would be seen as batshit insane. And I don't have a shortage of friends who think non-mainstream things: I am friends with self-proclaimed feminists, libertarians, communists, socialists, muslims, sikhs, buddhists... there's a lot of ideologies represented.

My initial reaction is to think ""I just need to expand my horizons until I find someone who thinks this way.""

But then I realized something: usually, when I have a hard time finding someone who believes something really ridiculous, it's because those people are closed-off socially, have small and isolated social circles, and don't expose themselves to normal people as much.

Which, judging from the kinds of people who associate with SRS, is probably their demographic.

So I'm going to throw this out there: it's OK to call out SRS people on their social aptitude when they are doing something that is so far removed from what a normal person would think is acceptable, like reading sexual assault into the image I linked earlier. You will realize that the person who thinks they're being objectified by the ""male gaze"" all the time is probably someone who hates eye contact to begin with. If you start thinking of their talking points as byproducts of being *really bad* at social interaction, they start to make a lot more sense. "	t5_2uuwv	True

A guy goes on Reddit [and exposes](http://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/14f6ef/um_social_media_director_jordan_miller_lies_on) a woman who works for the University of Michigan for lying on her job application and [resume](http://imgur.com/a/RLn96) about having a degree...which she did not have.  The position paid over 90k per year.

Shortly after, the woman [resigns.](https://www.michigandaily.com/news/12social-media-director-resigns-amid-allegations11)  Oops.

If that were not enough, the plot thickens.

The woman who lied on her resume and resigned, is the [Ex-wife of the guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/14f6ef/um_social_media_director_jordan_miller_lies_on/c7f24rg) who exposed her on Reddit.

Why did he do it?  Because she claimed, in court with her word and the words of her son (who father claims was coached) as evidence, that he was abusive.  As a result of this claim, **with no trial**, the man loses his half custody of his only son to the woman.  I think I've heard this song and dance somewhere before.

**Now obviously, only this man and woman know the truth here. None of us in /r/srssucks can know what really happened and thus, cannot pass judgement one way or the other.**

Since this subreddit is called SRSsucks, however, I thought you would all be interested in SRS's take on the whole scenario.

Personally, for me, it's not worth it because my first, and only, marriage, pretty much, in every way imaginable, broke me.

My wife turned into one of these ""empowered women"" who suddenly had no desire to shave her armpits and wanted to pursue a career as a burlesque dancer, of all things. She went from being a sweet, loving, caring, supportive spouse and equal partner to a self-centered, manipulative, dishonest, sweaty, overweight dancer with pit bush. Little did I know her metamorphosis brought about another disgusting physical trait, that being the inability for her keep her legs closed.

In 2011, I was making more than double what I am now. I had a house. We had, what I thought, was a happy home. Now I'm underemployed, going through foreclosure, bankruptcy and a divorce on top of missing out on half of my daughter's life. I'm going to be saddled with child support that, while greatly reduced over what she would've been granted two years ago, will still put a dent in my wallet every month, and will most likely be spent on more plus-sized bustiers, cheap-whore make-up and drinks at the bar.

SRS is supposedly big on not questioning, demeaning or downplaying a person's lived experience, so it'll be interesting to see if they treat mine with the same respect.

Right now, my plans are to wait until the papers are signed then get into a better paying job. There used to be a local lawyer who advertised specifically to men contemplating divorce. His commercials always ended with the tagline ""If you're a man, the best time to get a divorce is when you can least afford it."" I never understood how true that is until now."	t5_2uuwv	True

She's also a member of the Secular Student Alliance Board of Directors, and she was featured on More Magazine (www.more.com) at one point in time.

I don't know how a group like SRS led me to SRSsucks.  SRS, by its stated terms, is supposed to be more supportive of GSMs than SRSsucks.  And yet, despite the prevalence of ignorant language on SRSsucks, I feel way more free to speak my mind here.  SRS needs to fucking learn, us gender and sexual minorities don't need to be hidden away, protected by bans, and coddled.  What we need is a chance to explain our story, to present our arguments, to show the world that we're not just some crazed deviants that have nothing to add to society.  When someone severely injures their leg, you don't tell them to just give up, you inspire them to keep moving it against all odds, till their leg is stronger than ever.  SRS wants us GSMs to give up, like they can provide us cover, but while our status may be embattled, we don't need cover, we need forward motion, to fight on and show the world our strength.

Fuck them, we don't need cover.  Our arguments for acceptance are logical and coherent, and America is all about logical and coherent arguments.  I don't want to be coddled, I want to be given a chance to express myself, and to tell my side of the story.

So, before I log off for the last time, thank you /r/SRSsucks for giving me a free and open platform.  It has meant the world to me.  Running into a group like SRS on reddit practically broke my heart, running into you restored my faith in humanity.

&gt; First thing get a divorce lawyer and work out custody. Immediately. One of the posters claimed you shouldn't go for custody. This is wrong. Using your child in such a way speaks volumes about her as a person. This is not the type of person that should be raising children. (This is to takes pettiness to a whole new level. Chances are she got on the phone and laughed about it.) In some states this is child abuse. 

&gt; As for not moving out, STAY PUT! (EDIT: Apparently my first version of this post was entirely wrong.) after doing a little bit of research it appears that he/she who controls the house is he/she that gets the kids. Fight for the house so you can protect your kids.

&gt; Most importantly, do not let the idea that you're a man cloud your judgement. You have every right to bring the hammer down on her. She chose to incite open war against you. Do not be a white knight. **Do not, for one second, consider her or what she wants as you proceed. Do not think you have to be chivalrous. Fuck that bitch.** Once she figures out you plan to fight, she will try to manipulate you. Don't let her. Take her to court and if you can, crush her like the vermin this story makes her out to be. 

&gt; Do not go out looking for rebound sex. Take your time, establish yourself as an individual, enjoy some of the things you gave up when you married. 

&gt; Move on. Use this as a learning experience and let that bitch kick rocks.

&gt; **EDIT: I mistakenly advised him to move out and avoid the drama. This was wrong on every level.**

SRSWomen debate whether the woman was sexually assaulted. Consensus: it depends on whether the woman felt like it was, not on any of the facts of the encounter.

[Here's the link](http://en.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/1hihfm/feeling_conflicted_about_a_sexual_encounter_i_had/). Ugh, this just perfectly captures how toxic their attitude is towards sexuality.

The encounter:

&gt; Anyway, he started cuddling me and rubbing my stomach. He stopped and asked and was like ""Can I kiss you? Or should I stop? I feel like you aren't in the right state of mind. I don't want to be rapey.."" I remember sort of wanting to say, ""Yeah, let's just stop."" but the words wouldn't come out and for some reason I felt conflicted and didn't want to keep going..but also did not want to stop. I sort of remember mumbling and shrugging, like ""that's fine."" It makes no sense. I said, ""Let's just cuddle for now.""

&gt; So we did but then it escalated again, I felt like I was in a trance almost. He ended up fingering me and I remember encouraging it, but also feeling extremely conflicted due to the fact that I wasn't interested in this guy at all while sober (I wasn't attracted to him while sober at all, ugh). We ended up going to a different room and I gave him a blowjob and he gave me oral as well. As I've said, I remember being halfway into it, and halfway feeling sort of depressed/ashamed of what I was doing. **I communicated with him the whole time and told him what to keep doing and what to stop doing.** I just never quite felt like I was all there, though. He wasn't all there either, really.

&gt;If you do feel assaulted, I think that you are totally justified in feeling that way. I think the fact that he asked and even said ""I don't want to be rapey"" is a clear indication that he was sober enough to know that he was crossing a line. "	t5_2uuwv	True

[**S**elective **R**eading **S**kills](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/18v2j3/srs_on_warren_farrell_at_maximum_sensationalism/c8ie01y)  - The AMA 

there was fair warning that the AMA would be taking place, as it was advertised on both the IAMA and MR subs leading up to when it took place. multiple subs reacted accordingly. /r/mensrights had a couple of threads advertising it, /r/againstmensrights (unofficial fempire sub) created a [counter thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/againstmensrights/comments/18treb/post_reminding_mras_to_brigade_the_fuck_out_of/), and even /r/subredditdrama had a thread preemptively in place (deleted by mods later) before the AMA was even up.

a number of individuals got questions in *very* early, many of whom clearly had responses waiting to be copied and pasted. SRSer antiLogical was one of the first, pasting a [wall of text](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18tv7j/i_am_warren_farrell_author_of_why_men_are_the_way/c8hwvl7). some claimed they were loaded questions, but another SRSers deemed it an ""[extremely moderate post](http://www.reddit.com/r/againstmensrights/comments/18treb/post_reminding_mras_to_brigade_the_fuck_out_of/c8hxhjf)"". 

other drama quickly popped up. after a user was called out simply for being an SRSer, [Fempire sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/WhereAreTheFeminists/) moderator /u/ratjea commented that a user was ""[a member of our local misogynistic hate group — r/mensrights.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18tv7j/i_am_warren_farrell_author_of_why_men_are_the_way/c8hxbaj)"" 

the [top comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18tv7j/i_am_warren_farrell_author_of_why_men_are_the_way/c8hwxz8) for most of the day was held by an individual with a username SRS would likely jump all over if it was an SRSsucks or /r/mensrights member. as it happens, the poster was an SRSer (and mod of /r/chemtrails) and the comment focused on the pro-incest allegations SRS believed. Dr. Farrell deftly [responded](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18tv7j/i_am_warren_farrell_author_of_why_men_are_the_way/c8hz8nm), putting the issue to bed for most concerned individuals.

-------------------------------

SRS - Official Fempire Response 

ArchangelleGabrielle (AAG) had a lengthy [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/18txpg/metatw_warren_farrell_noted_mens_rights_activist/) up in SRS Prime within about an hour of the start of the AMA. however, the post **doesn't even link to the AMA**. it links instead to a [ManBoobz post](http://manboobz.com/2012/11/21/what-mens-rights-guru-warren-farrell-actually-said-about-the-allegedly-positive-aspects-of-incest-note-its-even-more-repugnant-than-that-sounds/) which attempts to tackle Warren Farrell. so instead of confronting what the man actually had to say, they instead choose to take ancient comments out of context and then have them interpreted by a clearly biased party. off to a strong start SRS!

a lot of lube was needed for this level of jerk, so naturally AAG had to twist things as only an Archangelle can. AAG comments that instead of going to the AMA, fellow SRSers can see ""all the fucked up shit he has said below"", copied and pasted straight from the ManBoobz post. but here's the catch: most of what AAGabrielle attributes to Farrell **wasn't even said by Farrell**. they were third party summaries or paraphrases of Farrell's academic work which were attributed to Farrell. a simple word count shows that out of AAG's post only 30% of the words were from actual quotes by Farrell, and Farrell claims he was actually misquoted in one of those. there is no delineation of what is quoted and what is not, with the only emphasis being parts AAG bolded for effect. 

yet again, this falls to being a criticism of the echo chamber qualities SRS demonstrates. content was cherry picked, misrepresented (either lazily or blatantly, i'm not sure which is worse), and then used as a representative sample of a 69 year old man's entire body of work. but AAG controlled the flow of information for many SRSers by A. trying to keep posters away from the AMA and B. presenting an *incredibly* biased view of Farrell which would color the views of those who did venture into the AMA.

SRS - Feels vs. Facts

SRS: 
&gt;[""RAPING KIDS IS AWESOME!!!"" -The Men's Rights Movement](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/18txpg/metatw_warren_farrell_noted_mens_rights_activist/c8i1woh)

Farrell: 
&gt;[i have always been opposed to incest, and still am](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18tv7j/i_am_warren_farrell_author_of_why_men_are_the_way/c8hz8nm)

this is classic SRS and it is despicable. though misguided, i can see how the misunderstanding about Farrell's positions came about. but to say something like this, jerk or not, crosses a line for me. and somehow, that text in giant red letters (without a trigger warning even!) managed to be sitting at +42 when i pulled it.

SRS:
&gt;[""Um, Dr. Farrell I think we all agree the men have it the worst of anyone ever but is there hope for us to defeat the evil feminazi she-devils who have taken all of our rights and literally control the government?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/18txpg/metatw_warren_farrell_noted_mens_rights_activist/c8i1bt1). 

Farrell: 
&gt;[the feminist movement has catalyzed and pioneered infinite levels of contributions for our daughters, and that should never be reversed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18tv7j/i_am_warren_farrell_author_of_why_men_are_the_way/c8hxh2i).

Farrell was actually a fairly [prominent feminist leader](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Farrell#Feminist_Foundation) and clearly still has some sympathies in that regard. the misrepresentations of Farrell as some sort of woman hating beast are clearly off the mark.

i could go on and on with awful quotes from SRS but as it happens SRS is blocked here at work so that is all i have for now. what it comes down to is that the incest and rape apology SRS is claiming is almost entirely nonexistent. Farrell was attempting to study the delicate subjects from an unbiased academic perspective, seeking to ""[ask people about their experience without the bias of assuming it was negative or positive](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18tv7j/i_am_warren_farrell_author_of_why_men_are_the_way/c8hz8nm)"". Farrell made his views on incest quite clear in the AMA, stating ""[i have always been opposed to incest, and still am](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18tv7j/i_am_warren_farrell_author_of_why_men_are_the_way/c8hz8nm)"". 

when engaged in debate context is massively important, *especially* when dealing with subjects as sensitive as these. by picking and choosing comments, ignoring context or clarifications, and by adding in a sense of 'guilty until proven innocent' SRS has unfairly painted a man as being an incest apologist. no person should ever be slandered as something that disgusting without definitive, unbiased, and conclusive proof of said accusations.

-------------------------------

My Soapbox -

what it all comes down to, in my opinion, is this. Warren Farrell used to identify as a feminist, not only as an activist but [even going so far as to take leadership roles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Farrell#Feminist_Foundation). but in the eyes of some, he slipped up by daring to critique the feminist movement for failing to address some issues that men will face. and to make matters worse, Farrell chose to shift his focus to mens issues. 

this has to be quite irritating for the more radical feminists out there. it is easy to dismiss critiques of feminism from your typical average joe misogynist. but dissent from within is quite damning, and it threatens the more radical ideology more than any outside commentary ever could.

so what do they do? they try to discredit him entirely by painting him as a rape, incest, and/or pedophilia apologist. because as SRS well knows, if you scream those words often enough and loud enough you will get attention from a lot of people, true or not. (just look at the jailbait nonsense.) and of course, it is far easier to yell than it is to sit down and try to academically refute a well spoken, mild-mannered, and seemingly well educated old man."	t5_2uuwv	True

Which was linked to SRS in this thread:

&gt;[""You're a dumbass. My ex spends the child support money on her cell phone, pedicures, etc. So then I have to turn around and STILL buy all of my daughters clothes and shoes. So yes, it's still slavery and it's still unfair. You fuck.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1fd7nm/youre_a_dumbass_my_ex_spends_the_child_support/)

Now at the time it was linked it was at a +19 and at the time of this writing it is at a +14.  Not much of a change it seems.  However, the rabbit hole goes a little deeper.  If you look through the thread or if you look at /u/cliff_hangar's user page for his comments in that thread you will see he was brigaded with downvotes on the **SEVEN** posts he made in that particular thread, including one about buying clothes and shoes for his 7 year old daughter.  These are important details.

Meanwhile, over on SRS in the thread they made /u/cliff_hangar, presumably on a throwaway, makes an attempt to defend himself and predictably gets banned.  But not before SRSer /u/second_child_of_BRD has a go at him with this comment:

&gt;[dude gtfo of SRS](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1fd7nm/youre_a_dumbass_my_ex_spends_the_child_support/ca9g63e?context=3)

This then prompts /u/cliff_hangar to send a nasty PM to /u/second_child_of_BRD who decides it is worthy of a posting in /r/SRSMailBag.  It is this posting and the screenshot where we see the evidence of an SRSer who has touched the poop.

[Here is the screenshot of the PM which shows that /u/second_child_of_BRD has downvoted /u/cliff_hangar 7 times, the same number of posts he made in the thread SRS linked.](http://i.imgur.com/knYA4nx.png)

([My screenshot of that image just in case it suddenly gets deleted.](http://i.imgur.com/fpyNxCi.jpg))

And [a link to the thread in /r/SRSMailbag](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSMailbag/comments/1feh9i/single_dad_is_so_mangry_about_buying_his_daughter/)

Also [a screenshot of that submission in case it gets deleted](http://i.imgur.com/Ggiadhb.jpg)

How incredibly ignorant do you have to be to post a screenshot that shows you went out of your way to downvote brigade?

In any event, this is very much the type of solid proof necessary to put an end to the speculation about SRS vote brigading.  /u/second_child_of_BRD posts a lot (with over 10k comment karma in just 3 months) and is clearly an account meant only for the Fempire.  Yet, for whatever reason, and despite the rule in the sidebar and the [ArchAngelle's stern warnings about vote brigading](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1aqy6h/meta_reminder_dont_fucking_downvote/) this user just simply couldn't help but to touch the poop.

So now 2 questions remain:

1372217387.0	1h32ma	Harassing PMs sent from known SRSers and the Admins do nothing. (Proof inside)	ArchangelleDwoorkin	113	28	53	"Earlier today I think this posting got me banned from /r/SRSSucks but I've obviously worked things out with our mods and I've been given the OK to post it again.  

You'll notice that Ides refers to me as Puck.  I'm not and I've done everything to prove that to the mods.  If you look back in Ides' post history you'll see that she's accused about 10 different people of being Puck in the last two months.  She's a little obsessed. When she started  doing it to me I asked for proof. She couldn't provide it, of course.

When I first posted this an admin did reply to the thread.  All he did was accuse me of ""ban evasion.""  Again, without proof.

Here's the text from the original thread:

&gt;In the past 24 hours I have received harassing PMs from two different members of SRS.  
&gt;
&gt;The first:
&gt;
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/9FDJqWr.png
&gt;
&gt;is from /u/TheRaggedQueen.  A SRSer that I have never heard of and as far as I know I've never posted in or about a thread involving that users.
&gt;
&gt;The second:
&gt;
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/OKQUpTv.png
&gt;
&gt;is from /u/theidesoflight.  In that PM she attempts to claim that I am Puck (who has been shadowbanned).  I'm not and I ask her to provide proof or shut the fuck up.  She then calls me a ""bitch"" and a ""spineless piece of shit.""
&gt;
&gt;As you can see here I've taken the liberty of contacting the admins about Ides:  http://i.imgur.com/8Ir1kTC.png
&gt;
&gt;The only real interaction I've had with /u/theidesoflight is to firmly but politely ask her to address the fact that as a mod of /r/blackladies she called for racially motivated violence.  I've also asked her to provide proof if she's going to continue to insist that I'm someone I'm not.  
&gt;
&gt;Ides has dodged both questions.
&gt;
&gt;You'll also notice that seemingly the only reason /u/theidesoflight PM'd me was to get a response from me so she could block PMs and then harass me.  The fact that she had to PM me at all is proof that I have never sent her a PM (if I had she could have used it to block me).
&gt;
&gt;Obviously I've gotten under Ides' skin but that's not the real issue here.  The real issue is that known SRSers are sending harassing PMs and the admins don't seem to care.  Meanwhile it seems that some members of /r/srssucks were banned Sunday night for sending harassing PMs.
&gt;
&gt;To be clear, I am totally against any sort of harassment via PM.  While I think it's fine to engage people in public comments it's NOT OK to do so via PM. That makes things way more personal than they should be.  So, I do think that those people who were banned for sending PMs got what they deserved.  I just wish that everything was adjudicated fairly.

Let's get behind this and force the admins into action.  Remember they banned members of SRSSucks for sending ""harassing PMs"" but no one has seen those PMs.  I'm posting verified proof of harassment.

Because honestly, there can be quality posts and the most painful thing about the subreddit is the nagging feeling of ""why??? It doesn't have to be this way!"" There's no reason why you should ever find yourself being strawmanned into standing against equality for merely wanting to say ""hey, um, that's not exactly accurate.""

**Nobody should *want* to be a circlejerk**   
This is the biggest thing. Rule X. The subreddit seemed to have missed the memo we all got that you don't *want* to be a circlejerk. Think about it; it's seriously one of the worst insults you can possibly gain as a subreddit. It's why atheists hate r/atheism, its why people hate r/politics...

But SRS seems to think labeling yourself INTENTINALLY a circlejerk is somehow wrapping an invulnerability cloak around what you say. It's like if some guy comes up and hits you in the stomach and say ""no, I'm an asshole *on purpose* so it's okay! Its just what I do!"" Whether you're doing it on purpose or not, the fact remains: you're an insuferable asshole. It's just not a good thing, even if its what you're trying for. 

(the one counter-example is r/circlejerk, whose point, by being a circlejerk, is that circlejerks suck)

**Satire =/= sarcasm =/= hyperbole**  
None of these words are the same. While BRDs tend to hit sarcasm pretty frequently and hyperbole quite hard, they never even come close to satire. Satire works because you *could* actually believe it if it weren't for it being absurd. You *could* mistake A Modest Proposal as serious until the very end because it is done with a level of sincerety - the reasons he gives DO actually make sense! The monetary benefits and decrease in poor populations WOULD happen and save for some subtle, tongue-in-cheek clues that it's a joke, you almost become worried you've read it wrong and it is an honest call to eat babies. It mimics something by pretending to be sincere, and exposing the absurdity that is inherently in it. Sarcasm functions by being as insincere as possible as a point. And hyperbole is the stupidest thing in the whole universe, so it's mostly employed by people 15 and under.

I think I'll break this up for now. Obviously, the hateful things that are said and general ignorance are problems, but the reason these two things are worse is because they are what incubates it and lets it grow instead of just get turned away as the shit it is. Rule X systematically justifies silencing opinions that don't do lipservice to what you already believed, and lets people pretend as if it were just a quirky trait of the subreddit. And pretending everything you say is satire lets you always double back on your words and hide under the guise of comedic tools you don't actually understand. It lets you fall back to ""what? It was just a joke!"" while still feeding the actual feelings you have that *do* agree with what you're saying. It's like the South trying to pass of blackface as satire when they actually *did* have racist views of black people."	t5_2uuwv	True

This happens at least once a month since we started and always seems to be the same people or person.  This is often accompanied with a ""Lets turn on the MODS"" post, like the one posted yesterday.

I thought you would all like to see this conversation as it shows how sad  SRS and this type of troll are.  They really accomplish nothing at all.  They make comments that sorta just fly under the radar, upvote themselves, and then somehow think they are master trolls.  

What SRS fail to realize is that we are here for one main reason, and that is to laugh and mock SRS.  If a troll is adding to the jokes, what are they accomplishing?  NOTHING!!!  Someone would have made a similar comment/joke anyway.  Making multiple accounts to somehow bring us down from the inside is such a useless venture.  

Maybe they think they can cause some mass paranoia and make everyone suspicious of everyone else.  That is just plain goofy too.  As I said, saying things that stay within the rules then claiming to be a troll only makes SRS look bad, not us. 

Going over the top is too obvious.  No one is gonna take that seriously, but just joining in on the jerk and thinking this will cause any harm to us is funny.  

Again, this takes place all of the time around here.   I wanted to show you all so you can join in with us in laughing at these trolls when they come out from under their bridges and expect to be showered with praise for being a master troll.   It will happen again in a few weeks, so y'all won't have to wait too long to see it happen.

Really is this that hard?  Do I even need to explain this?  Why would they even think that people make purely __sexual__ decisions on what the other person's ineffable _internal mental state_ concerning their gender?

And then the next question that ought to be asked is: If biology ought not to be important in these sexual decisions, or in general (SRS' purported ideal), then why even consider sexual reassignment surgery and hormones to move towards a different _biological_ form?  Why is concern about biological __appearance__ paramount to these people who feel that they shouldn't be questioned about their gender __for sex__ (this is fucking important here, because it involves __two people with two sexual preferences__), but concerns from the opposite person about biology are literally Hitler?

I am a straight man.  When I have no-strings-attached sex, I am concerned with _biology_.  My penis wants what it wants.  Some bisexual people might like thick people, men and women.  Some gay people's penises may respond only to cocks that shoot 100% real grade-A baby batter, which last I checked can't be simulated.  You going to be assholes and shame these people too?  Why should this be different for straight men?  What if they're not after surgically produced imperfect vaginal simulations?  

Maybe this will change when they can make genetalia biologically _identical_, but we are _not_ there yet, no matter how much trans* people wish we were.  And even if we were, what if a biological man wants to take things seriously, with the eventual expectation of a child, considering 99% of straight men will eventually want this?  What then?  In this perfect-genetalia-replication hypothetical, the fact that you've mimicked biology so closely __will eventually lead to you needing to disclose__.

__There is no choice-space for me (and other straight guys) that involves biological men.__  That isn't bigotry (for me at least), because in my case there is no hate or intolerance behind it; I just don't get turned on.  To each, their own, and I'm fine with other people's preferences.  This is _my_ __sexual__ preference, and fuck each and every one of you that would shame me for that, and insisting that I don't really know (or shouldn't) want what I want.

Shaming people into sexual preference (psychological coercion) is probably the lowest of the low.  This isn't just my belief, this is also SRS' belief, so I'm left wondering why the fuck I'm even writing this?

[What SRSters believe part 2.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/1dp4x9/what_srsters_believe_part_2_it_is_wrong_to_try_to/)

[What SRSters believe part 3.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/1dsxwy/what_srsters_believe_part_3_it_is_bigoted_to_not/)

I'd been collecting potential posts for awhile now, but I've enjoyed bundling *types* of submissions together rather than just a smattering of unrelated SRS submissions. I was inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/1fnzbc/feminist_sees_average_men_voicing_concerns_about/) submission here. SRS's ideology has a fascinating relationship with men. They are constantly both attacking men and attacking men for complaining about being attacked. Sometimes they will even go so far as to say that men complain about *imaginary* attacks. And then immediately after, do the thing that the man had complained about happening-- which the given SRSters said does not happen... For example, they will say that a man complaining about being treated as a pedophile for innocuous interactions with kids is shitthatneverhappened.txt and then turn around and start calling men pedophiles for no damn reason at all. [Here is a real life example of that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1fmca1/picture_of_a_young_girl_in_a_bathing_suit_shes/) You see, the girl was being very simple. She is ""not going to college"" because she's stupid. Because they literally can't stop thinking about children fucking, the SRSters chose to interpret this insult as sexual attraction. Somehow. It's pretty blatant that SRSters engage in the behavior that they insist never occurs. Sometimes I articulate this baffling behavior with a sardonic verse. ""Misandry don't real,"" cried the group dedicated to hating men.

__________________________________________________________

There's this interesting and popular complaint amongst SRSters. It's that men feel as though they should have the right to defend themselves against women. Almost always there's a comment inside about how ""reddit will go to any lengths to justify beating women."" The only problem is that those lengths, at least according to SRS, are almost always self defense. I mean to say that, according to SRS, men sometimes mention that they will hit a woman who attacks them or that they wish that it were socially acceptable to hit a woman who attacks them. In self defense. I have a few examples of this.

http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1er54q/anyone_who_hits_a_person_deserves_and_should/

http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/9412/11382

The top comments exemplify what I was describing above. 

&gt;[Does anyone else think it's really strange that Redditors advocate violence so freely? I feel like half of Reddit is existing in this hypothetical bubble of misandry where all women are evil and need to be taught a lesson. Like. This is a whole thread about how men should be able to hit women back, but I don't think there are ever threads about women hitting men back.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1er54q/anyone_who_hits_a_person_deserves_and_should/ca2ymqw)


.
&gt;[""I despise all women for thinking something that literally none of them think.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1er54q/anyone_who_hits_a_person_deserves_and_should/ca2x88i)

Yes. This is exactly what the redditor was trying to say. He literally despises all women. For a thing that literally none of them think. Except for every SRSter, apparently.

&gt;[""I delight in the thought of getting to hit someone who doesn't look like they can kick my ass in rebuttal.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1er54q/anyone_who_hits_a_person_deserves_and_should/ca307tj)

&gt;Sequence of events for these situations:

&gt;1. Man sexually assaults woman in a bar or club, e.g., grinding into her ass or grabbing her tits. 

&gt;1. Woman tells him to back off.

&gt;1. Man sexually assaults woman again, e.g., grinding into her ass or grabbing her tits. 

&gt;1. Woman slaps man.

&gt;1. Man punches woman. 

&gt;1. Man brags on Internet how he'll hit anyone who hits him first.

☑ Redditors trying to justify hitting women just because.

☑ Minsandry don't real (I mean, it's just hypothetical)

☑ Accusing men of something whilst complaining about them complaining about the thing they're being accused of.

In sum, it is bigoted for a man to physically defend himself from a female attacker. 
_______________________________

Got another few. Here's one.

http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1fh75b/in_response_to_a_question_asking_which_taboo/

http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/9415/11383

So the question was about what taboo redditors would like to be lifted. The user's response was that he didn't think it should be taboo for a man to hit a woman in self defense.

Second comment.

&gt;[As we've seen a lot lately, Redditors love to find ways to justify the beating of women. They ask why men cannot beat women, instead of asking why women's violence is considered trivial.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1fh75b/in_response_to_a_question_asking_which_taboo/caa7v5u)

&gt;Basically he's asking for the taboo of violence against women to be lifted.

It was pretty obvious by the comment... because it said so... that HE WAS ASKING FOR THE TABOO OF NOT BEING ABLE TO ***DEFEND YOURSELF FROM A WOMAN*** to be lifted.

From the top comment in that one:

&gt;[Not Taboo: How come when I go to a playground with my daughter people automatically assume that I'm a creepy-ephebophiledelphian? That's unfair!!!1!](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1fh75b/in_response_to_a_question_asking_which_taboo/caaafso)

Cool. Tossed in one of those things that don't happen that happen even though it was entirely irrelevant.

Next.

_______________

Here's an EFFORT post about men not being able to defend themselves against women. Kind of similar to the one at the top of this post that was already linked here in SRSs.

http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1fgdmc/effortful_poop_scoop_tm_from_i_watched_this/

http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/8871/11384

The most fascinating aspect of this post is the spawning image macro that was used in the SRS submission title. ""'I watched this happen at the grocery store today. A woman attacked a man with a knife because he took the last case of coke. He knocked her out in self-defense.' on r/adviceanimals - YAY VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMAN!!!! FUCK THE MATRIARCHY!!""

It is bigoted for a man to defend himself against a person who is ***literally*** trying to murder him if the attempting murderer is a woman.

Inside this effort is a bunch of terribly bigoted things that redditors have said. Including how men and women are treated differently if they accuse someone of rape. 

Here's that comment about how redditors are trying to justify hitting women.

&gt; [""A woman committed a crime?! Better circlejerk about beating women."" --Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1fgdmc/effortful_poop_scoop_tm_from_i_watched_this/caa1zmy)

""A woman is trying to murder me? Better circlejerk about not letting her murder me.""

_____________

Guess what. It's also bigoted for men to defend themselves against *sexual* assault (perpetrated by a woman). 

http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1fnz3o/so_the_next_time_a_dame_grabs_my_dick_in_a_bar/

http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/9419/11385

The sinful quote is this:

&gt;[So the next time a dame grabs my dick in a bar can I haymaker her?](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1fn9q0/just_a_quick_little_kiss_please/cac1nth)

It was in reference to [this gif.](http://i.imgur.com/CqxcU9G.gif) This guy asks a random girl if he can have a kiss and leans in a little (obviously not all the way to her, he expected her to meet him half way) and she slapped the shit out of him.

The comments in the SRS thread reflect some of those themes I keep mentioning. 

[shitthatneverhappens](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1fnz3o/so_the_next_time_a_dame_grabs_my_dick_in_a_bar/cac50nr)

[Don't try to justify hitting women.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1fnz3o/so_the_next_time_a_dame_grabs_my_dick_in_a_bar/caca9qd)

I think I might be about halfway done here. I hope.

______

I think this one would have made more sense if this were the first one... So this is SRS worthy simply because it involves men talking about the various difficulties that men face in society. Usually by people who make negative assumption of men (sound like anyone you know?). 

Oh shit, [the poster deleted or something.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1fnwww/effort_askmen_thinks_society_is_a_terrible/) Well that kind of throws a monkey wrench into this part of Part 4. Um. [Here's the askmen thread in question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1flekp/what_are_your_thoughts_on_this_talk_radio_episode/) You can see the sort of things they're talking about. Many of the top comments made it into the SRS effort post. You'll even see some fuchsia in the askmen thread. Anyone know what happened here? Was the OP an SRSs troll? I've been away, perhaps I'm out of the loop. In any fashion, I wish I screenshotted or used a snapshot or something. Let that be a lesson to all of us. Mostly me.

TITLE: ""Fuck You, Men's Rights Activists"" (establishing sophisticated positions from the get go)

&gt; *This is Fuck You Week, Jezebel's first annual week of desperate emotional cleansing and unhinged psychic purging.* (they started this just so they could get self-righteous about MRAs)

&gt; Fuck you, first of all, for making it nearly impossible for decent men struggling with abusive partners or unfair custody arrangements to get the help they need and deserve. You have forever tainted those issues with your rage-filled, obsessively anti-woman horseshit, to the point where it's become difficult for any rational, compassionate person to trust a man who claims he's been screwed over in family court or abused by a female partner, even if he has.

&gt; That's right—I fully understand that those things happen. I fully believe that men in those situations deserve help, and I know they're generally less likely to ask for it than women are, not to mention less likely to find help there for them when they do go looking. I get how our society's ridiculously rigid ideas about masculinity mean that men are brought up to believe needing help will make them look weak, especially if it's a woman who's terrorizing them. I know those same suffocating standards also encourage men to stifle strong feelings and any nurturing tendencies, which deprives them of the right to experience the full range of human emotions without shame. That completely fucking sucks! You know how I know all that, and why I think it sucks?

&gt; BECAUSE I'M A FEMINIST.

(oh god I am so moved by the individualism. so poetic. such a revolutionary underdog. this is clearly someone who is on the right side of history and not at all someone who dramatically and ostentatiously wears ideological labels like fashion brands)

&gt; That's the thing, MRAs. By and large, American feminists are really into equality, involved fathers, justice for all, dismantling bullshit gender roles, and helping folks leave dangerous relationships. We would be the natural allies of MRAs, if MRAs were sincerely committed to the causes with which they claim to be chiefly concerned. But no, today's MRAs—unlike the 1970s movement that earnestly sought to free men, alongside women, from the constraints of gender stereotypes, or the 1980s branch that involved a lot of drum circles and crap poetry—are chiefly concerned with one thing, and one thing only: Putting feminists in their place. Which is in the kitchen at best and in the ground at worst, if you ask these unapologetically misogynistic bags of rot.

&gt; So fuck you, MRAs. Fuck you for showing up every time women speak, especially about rape and abuse, and trying to make it all about you. Fuck you for derailing threads about the victims of Marc Lépine, a man who screamed about his hatred for feminists as he murdered fourteen women and injured many others, because you also hate feminists and want a fucking cookie for not killing anyone. Fuck you for making rape and death threats against young women who dared to protest a speaking engagement by a man who thinks little girls would enjoy being raped by their fathers if it weren't for society telling them it's dirty. Fuck you for whining about how unfair it is that women might wonder if you're a rapist when you approach them out of nowhere, while completely ignoring how unfair it is that women feel the need to be on guard all the time in public. Or that if we relax and behave normally—drinking, dancing, dressing however we want—you will be the first motherfuckers in line to blame us for getting ourselves raped.

&gt; Fuck some of you for being so contemptuous of women, you don't even believe in convicting rapists. Fuck all of you for doing your very best to propagate myths that make it harder for women to be safe—that we're a bunch of lying temptresses who bang hapless men and file bogus rape charges for the lulz, for instance, or that we get into perfectly even fights with our hardworking, loving husbands, then call the cops and have them arrested because we're spiteful bitches. Fuck you for blaming women, feminists, the legal system, and men who aren't misogynistic assholes for your own inability to relate to other human beings in appropriate ways.

&gt; Fuck you for pretending your primary goal as a ""movement"" is anything other than control of women's lives and bodies. Fuck you for being so delusional about how women behave in the real world, you fell for a parody of your worst nightmare—and lined up to support a guy who told you he'd punched his girlfriend. Fuck you for arguing, presumably straight-faced, that facing consequences for hitting your child is basically the same as being a Jewish person in Nazi Germany.

&gt; Fuck you for trying to make ""misandry"" happen. Your feminist enemies don't hate men; we only hate men who proudly stand up for the rights of abusers, rapists, and deadbeat dads.

&gt; Fuck you for starting every sentence with ""fuck you."" You are not the Martin Luther King of women giving a historical speech to the people on the stage of a massive civil rights movement. I know you learned in public speaking or rhetoric or whatever that this kind of rhetoric is effective, but you're writing for fucking Jezebel. This is like trying to publish the Declaration of Independence on perezhilton.com. (oops how did this paragraph get in there.)
 
(btw, lots of links in the above paragraphs (which I didn't transfer) that have all of the critical reading and attention to context we've come to know and love from SRS)

&gt; Fortunately, there aren't very many of you, no matter how hard you try to build a ""movement."" The simple fact is, most men don't beat, rape, or resent caring for their own children, and thus have no need for the kind of support and ""activism"" you specialize in. The ""work"" you do guarantees you'll continue to attract entitled shitbags who hate women, while driving away decent people who thought you might have something interesting to say—right up until they realized what you're really about.

&gt; Finally, here is my reply to every pro-MRA comment that has been or will be left on this thread or any other: Fuck you. 

scarequotes, ""shitbags"", and ending on ""fuck you"": if it's good enough for an SRS v. MRA reddit comment you'd find in the bowels of /r/SubredditDrama, it's good enough for Jezebel

A reddit where you have a right to never be offended. A reddit where feelings outweigh logic and reason. A reddit where every word is measured, every privilege is checked. As a relevant gif would say, ""ain't nobody got time for that."" Fuck all that.

I like being able to speak my mind. I hate having my thoughts policed.

I don't mind the members of SRS, from the true-blue Kool-Aid-drinkers to ones who are a part of SRS for nothing more than shits and giggles, having their opinions. Nor do I have a problem with them voicing their opinions. What I don't like is when they demand the rest of reddit adopt their standards. Whether they like it or not, freedom of speech exists. Freedom from hurt feelings, on the other hand, is a myth. Their myth.

I also have no problem with them voicing their opinions. It adds to the discussion, which is always welcome. Everyone should have place at the table, in my opinion. Where they go wrong is when they become yeast-infected thundercunts and start doxxing and threatening people with whom they disagree. (of course they'll point to their policy against doxxing, but everyone knows that's bullshit. Predditor tumblr, anyone?)

1349705572.0	114z17	[FAQ] SRS_Invasion_Bot - Post-Apocalypse Edition		109	35	29	"    1. What is SRS, and why does the bot exist?

SRS is full of normal people, well balanced people. Like all normal people, they believe that all men are rapists, all white people hark for the days of slavery, and reddit exists for the sole purpose of the white male majority to oppress, well, everybody.

But that isn't the reason why the bot exists. Like all visionaries througout history, SRS sees a world in deep need of their ""help"". If only the rest of the world saw the superiority of their victim complexes, the evil patriarchy that all men are party too will cease to exist, and the world will be full of rainbows, unicorns and all possible flavours of cupcakes.

Like a panzer division in 1939, SRS spreads their vision of glorifying faux oppression by surprise arrival on-masse. They coralle their users with links that they identify as ""shitty"". SRS official policy is that while voting in said links will be severly punished with silly hats and approving winks, however SRSers are free to comment in threads that were not intended for them, and were it not for the link would have no interest in.

This bot seeks to out these people for who they are.

    2. I'm not an SRSer, why am I being called out?

It means that you are showing up on the nosrs.tk list due to making a post in SRS in the last 40 days, while commenting in an SRS Invaded thread. race_bannon's list is not perfect. 

Message me with your best SRS insult if you would like your name removed.

    3. What does Invader Score and Fempire Loyalty mean?

The Invader Score is an all time count of the number of times that user has been caught invading. This is an indicator of how strong a hit the bot has.

Fempire Loyalty is a sigmoid filtered count of the frequency of SRSisms that SRSer uses. It is mostly for fun.

    4. I hate you. You don't have a life, why do you waste your time?

You would be surprised how little work it is. This bot is much more efficient at annoying SRSers than I would be. That leaves me more time to oppress minorities and promote a rape-culture on reddit, as is my duty as a non-SRS ""shitlord""."	t5_2uuwv	True

This morning, I find out that an SRSer posted a link to the removed submission, and several BRDs were jerking each other off over how stupid we are and how we are evil for allowing dox in our sub. I figure I'll be a nice guy and send the mods a PM, letting them know that one of their members is linking to a submission that contains dox, explaining that I've already removed it on my end, and asking them to remove it on their end.

So I wait. And wait. No response. The submission still visible. I wait some more.

I got tired of waiting and decided to send the admins a message, explaining the situation. Within minutes of contacting the admins, Strudelle is PMing me, saying he removed it, followed by a PM from an admin, letting me know it had been removed. I'm guessing the dox would still be there had I not involved the admins.

An SRSer linked to dox and the Archangelles allowed it to remain for three hours. My theory is that they allowed the dox to remain because it involved someone they recently banned. 

""She's no longer one of us, so fuck her.""

The post had a lifespan of ten minutes here in SRSsucks. SRS extended that lifespan to over three hours. You tell me who's evil.

A post in SRSDiscussion, about [gender-exclusive groups being problematic or not](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/1ctxdt/are_genderexclusive_groups_inherently_problematic/) ([s](http://i.imgur.com/4AMHZUe.png)), was deleted with this reason by /u/ArchangelleEzekielle:

&gt; [Painting men-only clubs as the equivalent to women-only spaces is pulling a false equivalence. Women, as a sociological minority, need safe spaces. This is not the same as exclusionary male-only clubs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/1ctxdt/are_genderexclusive_groups_inherently_problematic/c9k1kbm)([s](http://i.imgur.com/m19EpjU.png))

Later the post was reapproved after the their doctrine was added by the OP.

---

So, they call it a ""false equivalence"", because they claim that women **need** safe spaces, them being a ""sociological minority"".

Of course, women aren't an actual minority, [in contrary](http://i.imgur.com/jALhKW7.png) ([source](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2018.html#us)), so they invent ""sociological minority"" (**meaning**: not a minority in numbers, but in influence) to rationalize their discriminating. Ok, the term itself does make some sense, although how much of a ""sociological minority"" women think they are, if at all, remains an opinion. They like us to believe they've got it the worst, of course.

I also won't go into how much they ""need"" it compared to other people (even white men), because they look at everything from a group perspective and wouldn't touch the needs of individuals with a twenty foot pole. Individual problems don't real, no doubt. Discrimination laws exist for the reason that individuals shouldn't be judged based on traits assigned to the groups they belong to. SRS, however, is hellbent on turning that around again and *is* assigning group traits to individuals again. The least privileged of men are still more privileged than the most privileged of women in their logic, because they're men. It's a simple rule, like most bigoted rules are.

**Anyway**, to get to my point: what makes this whole ""theory"" so ridiculous, is that they seem to have the **POWER** to attain women safe-spaces **and** getting rid of men-only clubs.

If they don't have any power or influence, how can safe-spaces even exist? *They can't*. The group in power can simply invade/get rid of those, because they have the power. 

**If this possibility existed, any minority group (think jews in WWII, or human history with religious/racial prosecution, etc) could simply create safe-spaces and avoid prosecution, no matter where or when.** ..but everyone knows they can't.

The only people that can create safe-spaces from other groups in society are those *that have the power*.

**Conclusion / TL;DR**: The fact that women are gaining women only spaces and men are losing them is real proof that women are in fact the group that wields the most power at this time, because only people in power can create those spaces for themselves.

Men aren't allowed anymore. So, who's controlling them? Are men controlling and denying this themselves? I doubt it.

Their front page is instead filled with quotes of people's reactions to today's top story of [an extremist who executed a man in London by beheading him](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1euj7i/man_tries_to_justify_himself_to_people_filming/). It's a big story because the killer, hands covered in blood, gave a calm explanation of why he did it before being shot by the police. I haven't watched the video, it seems far too grisly for me, but I was able to put the story together. Unequivocally, it was religiously motivated killing but people would be right to point out that people who do these kinds of things *are* extremists. 

IAmSupernova already linked to the effort post on this so I'll leave it out of this catalog. 

First up is a decontextualized *mis*quote from a confession bear (the real purpose of this macro is to make a confession of something that you're at least moderately ashamed of). The actual quote is ""[I'm an ex-Muslim and truly want Islam to be the first religion to be eradicated.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1evs8k/something_with_islam_and_intolerance/)"" It's a lot easier for people recovering from a bad religious upbringing to see the problems with their own religion than criticize another which is probably why /u/wiro8743 opted to paraphrase a bit, interestingly leaving quotes around the the title, saying ""[I truly want Islam to be the first religion to be eradicated.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1ex07h/i_truly_want_islam_to_be_the_first_religion_to_be/)"" To examine that quote for a minute... This is /r/atheism and no one could really argue that a large portion of that user base would like to see a religion-free society. Taking a break from their usual bashing/discussion of Christianity, this user mentions they'd like Islam to go away *first* (not *only*). The reason I think that someone would feel this way is because Christianity is relatively powerless. Islamic nations are comparably theocratic, brutalizing people for acting outside of a conservative Muslim lifestyle. This includes, but is not limited to, the execution of gays, treating women like property worth less than animals, and the punishment (often execution) of people who practice other religions. These are whole nations I'm talking about here, not just extremists, who have these policies institutionalized as a matter of course. These are the rules, not the exceptions. And, of course, there are the ""extremists"" who kill/mutilate others for voting, throw acid in women's faces, blow things up all over the world, storm embassies, and protest en masse with signs like ""death to those who would oppose Islam,"" etc. If you were a person who wanted a religion free world and you had to list the religions in order of which ones you'd like to disappear first, of *course* it would be Islam. If this person was born in the 1500s but retained the same sentiments, it's likely that he'd want Catholicism to go first. 

Deserving of its own post, a quote from the comments of the above submission is [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1ewwrx/indeed_predominantly_muslim_nations_are_for_the/). 

&gt;Muslim nations are, for the most part, shitholes. The Muslims don't want to live in shitholes, because who would? So they go to other nations... and bring their shithole culture and shithole worldview with them

The user then goes on to explain that he *was* trying to vulgar in his tirade.

&gt;I wouldn't call it elegant... it was intentionally vulgar. Still, glad you enjoyed it. :)

This is kind of asked an answered. Many Muslim nations are teetering on the edge of development but for the reasons I mentioned above, those nations are often developmentally stunted and have policies derived from sensibilities that the majority of the world left behind centuries if not millennia ago. Those policies are not tied to the geographic location. They are derived from, and enforced by, people. So if location A is filled with people who believe X and X is an archaic, regressive, brutal belief, and people move from location A to location B, then you now have people in location B who believe X, much to the chagrin of the original inhabitants of location B. 

Another comment, clearly making a sardonic statement on the ""religion of peace"" line that is sometimes heard with regard to Islam, [is worthy of SRS' attention.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1evddq/another_man_culturally_enriched_by_diversity_and/) One [SRSter](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1evddq/another_man_culturally_enriched_by_diversity_and/ca4bvsr) just *can't believe* that anyone would ever upvote a bigoted [username.](http://www.reddit.com/user/misandrylady) Oops, wrong one. [Here.](http://www.reddit.com/user/misandrymaggie) Shit, I'm bad at this. [Um, this one?](http://www.reddit.com/user/princess-misandry). Well, whatever. You can just read it for yourself. She's also pissed that you could look into that person's user profile and see that he posts in a [racist sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/killwhitey). 

[Here's another effort post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1eusmn/effortrworldnews_discusses_the_recent_london/) In it is a simple opposition to being opposed to murderers. 

&gt;So my instinctive reaction is that 2 Muslims have seen a Soldier wearing a Help for Heroes sign. Gone full Cultral Enrichment on him and beheaded him. The police then put them down. I really hope that my comment is completely wrong else I don't think even a UKIP vote is enough to fix these scum. [+136]

Well, yeah. What is SRS objecting to here? Calling people who dismember other human beings in the street scum?

&gt;Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they're muslim. What a giant suprise, oh wait. [+98]

Okay, SRS. Who else would it have been? Who else cuts off people's heads in the middle of the street in modern day London? Who stones people to death? Who bombs cafes, buses, and marathons? Who flies planes into buildings? Not all Muslims do this, but when you hear about it happening, who do *you* assume it is and how often are you wrong?

[A redditor rightly predicts SRS' response.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1eurny/on_london_beheading_bring_in_the_muslim/) Quick, downvote him before he realizes how many posts we've made about this very topic.

Okay, here's something that we can all agree is a shitty thing to say. It's not about the London dismembering, it's about the social unrest in Sweden regarding crime in immigrant communities. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1eubfq/since_they_started_bringing_shit_skinned/

It's pretty fucked up to see a relatively small group of Muslim people do something disagreeable and then blame all of Islam for it. You can't generalize the behavior of a few people to a whole community. [Unless that community is reddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1et04m/2nd_day_of_riots_in_stockholm_suburb_shakes_sweden/ca3tna6?context=3) Well, at least [this guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1et04m/2nd_day_of_riots_in_stockholm_suburb_shakes_sweden/ca3vjxz?context=3) pointed out that it would take 450,000 upvotes to represent even 1% of reddit's userbase. Hm. Wonder why he was downvoted.


I pointed out in IAmSupernova's submission, that this all looks very familiar. About a year ago, a redditor referred to a man who cut off his own daughter's head as a caveman. [SRS was pissed](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/v8a4k/) because the guy was brown skinned and you can't call them cavemen no matter how many people they brutally murder.

Fin.

There's so many that I feel like this needs to be a group effort.

Add your own in the comments section!

I'll start:

- reddit is ""misogynist"", reddit is ""racist"", reddit is ""full of (pick at least one: pedophiles, rapists, racists, misogynists)""

- reddit is full of (apologists for the above things)""

- rationality is a gendered concept (no, seriously, many of them believe this)

- everything to do with [cultural appropriation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_appropriation), but more specifically that if a person of ('privileged' culture) does something by (minority culture), that person has ""appropriated"" it

- any field where the gender ratios are not 50:50 has a ""woman problem"" and sexism is the reason for those ratios

- ""female"" is a demeaning word

- slurs are oppressive, ""gendered slurs"" are oppressive

- ""rape jokes trivialize rape""

- for that matter, ""jokes about x trivialize x""

- for that matter, ""trivialization"" through language exists (people don't stop taking real things seriously just because a word is used casually in some context. we take killing someone more seriously now than ever before, in spite of ""kill"" being synonymous with ""did very well"")

- you cannot say their ideology is wrong unless you've taken gender studies as your major

- if you've taken gender studies as your major, you can't say it's wrong unless you've studied it as your Ph.D., because you'e not an ""expert""

- if you've gotten your Ph.D. in gender studies, you're a quack if you say it's wrong

- Men's Rights and /r/mensrights is ""hate speech""

- sex at any amount of drunkenness is rape

- all sex under the age of consent (even a 20 year old with a 16 year old) is rape

- checking someone out objectifies them

- complimenting someone's physical appearance objectifies them

- pretty much anything to do with objectification

- widespread belief in the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_social_science_model (which actually is not the standard social science model anymore, lol)

- lived experience suffices for demonstration of a phenomenon http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Lived_experience (one of the most batshit and regressive ideas SRS supports, takes a dump on the entirety of modern social science)

- they are not redditors (they are)

- sensitivity = morality

- any discussion of IQ is ""bigoted"" because IQ measurements negatively affect minorities

- for that matter, that standardized tests are ""racist""

- [resting your head on your girlfriend's butt is ""sexual assault""](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/1612vu/its_ok_to_call_srs_people_and_tumblr_feminists/)

- that SRS is about ""calling out bigotry"" (they regularly attack anyone who attacks SRS, which clearly has nothing to do with bigotry)

- that SRS is only about circlejerking (it is a circlejerk, but it's clearly designed to invade other subreddits)

- they want a ""safe space"" (they obviously care about advancing their views in *everyone's* space when possible)

- trigger warnings are useful (for a number of reasons they're not, including that they highlight the trauma designed to be prevented, they are abused in a tabloidesque fashion, etc.)

- ""checking your privilege"" (which you will notice follows the same rigor someone would use when writing a literary theory essay about how bram stoker's dracula is a story of sexual repression)

- privilege theory in general (the pseudo-sociological theory that they use for it, which is applied in the same way people at r/conspiracy talk about power)

- intersectionality (which [has a number of epistemic problems](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/15wjyo/the_epistemic_problems_with_intersectionality/))

- they are progressive (they are regressive/backward, especially on free speech issues, the social sciences, etc.; ""progressive"" depends on what you're progressing toward)

- ""derailing"" is a thing (most derailments are just shitty versions of logical fallacies, some are even valid rebuttals)

- females can't be sexist because the patriarchy (lol?)

But perhaps the most bizarre of all is difficult to describe as a belief -- their applications of labels like ""misogynistic"", ""sexist"" and so on, which almost never have explicitly defined criteria. The things they label ""misogynist"" or ""sexist"" stretch the definitions of those words to their semantic limits, and few in the mainstream would see the things SRS labels as misogynistic or sexist as such, except in obvious and extreme situations."	t5_2uuwv	True

**And here's our sample letter:**


*Subject Line: In response to pressuring emails you may be receiving from Redditors about [Company advertisement on Reddit]*


Hello,
My name is [first name] and I am [a blogger at [URL]/a community organizer/awesome guy/mentally stable person/a fan of your product/etc]. I also participate on the social media website Reddit. Recently, an extremely outspoken minority of Redditors have been making a lot of false claims about Reddit, and in turn generating quite a ruckus in the media. 

This group of redditors, 'Shit Reddit Says', are best known on Reddit for being a troll group masquerading under the guise of equality and minority rights. While accomplishing some good, they are best at discrediting themselves by curating 'subreddits' such as ""Kill Whitey"" (http://www.reddit.com/r/killwhitey) 

This group is frequently caught misrepresenting facts to people and organizations they consider easy targets in their elaborate trolling campaigns. They have exploited mass media sympathy through lies and misdirection in order to stage these campaigns, and have directly ruined people's lives. They have collaborated to publish an innocent man's personal identity on the notorious paparazzi website Gawker. The man they stalked ended up being publicly humiliated in front of the entire nation on CNN because he was falsely labeled as a pedophile. He was fired from his job, and subsequently lost the health insurance that his severely disabled wife relied on. 

 Currently, 'Shit Reddit Says' is collaborating within their community to pressure various advertisers such as yourself into distancing themselves from Reddit, so as to eliminate the free exchange of ideas that the majority of Redditors have come to love the website for. Their plan is to mislead you into believing that certain 'subreddits', are breaking state and local laws by taking photographs of people in public places. This couldn't be further from the truth, as there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in public places. These extremists have openly stated that their goal is to see Reddit burn to the ground.

I will continue to support [Product] as long as you advertise on Reddit, and I urge you not to take the words of professional trolls too seriously.

Thank You,
[Name]




**EDIT: Big surprise, everyone has a differing viewpoint of why SRS is silly, and how their trolling should be handled. I believe that it's important to at least show the advertisers that there is opposition to SRS's email and point of view. I encourage everybody to take the time to write a personalized opposition letter, as it is a more genuine approach, and it might cut through all of the noise of receiving a couple thousand identical versions of an email.**

Note that this isn't the same as saying he is a wonderful guy.

Given how often SJW say our legal system is broken, you'd think they'd be open to having this discussion. Unfortunately, admitting this would make them look bad because of their hyperbolic claims about the trial.

So how does SRS Discussion mod /u/minimuminim respond: ""I would recommend you read more about the Trayvon Martin case.

The news that [being a Marxist](http://i.imgur.com/hyRAQ.png) is integral to being a SRSter is fantastic. As SRS progresses, it is becoming less a big tent, and more a club of ideologues who must have every minutiae of belief *just so*. With this, they chase out everyone who may be a sympathizer but has a slightly divergent opinion.

After talking to a few mods, such as greenduch, I get the impression that the radicalization is getting out of hand. Not even the AAs know who is absolutely serious and who is taking the piss. Things will move towards their natural conclusion soon.

For SRS to reach its natural and logical conclusion, it needs the following:

1. Cult of personality. The AAs need more veneration with their thoughts deemed always as right.
2. More true believers. SRSters with almost religious devotion to the AAs, a shift from mere political ideology to creedal veneration.
3. More utopianism. True believers have to see SRS as what Reddit should ideally be. 
4. Real world (IRL) action. Actual events stamped by the SRS brand. Kind of like ""Occupy Wall Street"" style protests but with SRS front and center on everything.
5. Purges. Of course, as SRS becomes more radical, it will attempt to become more pure — and that means exposing, punishing, and banning any members who don't kowtow the party line.

/r/cleaningupaftersrs was, for roughly a few hours and 25 subscribers, a subreddit with the explicit purpose of countering SRS's brigades.

A point to note:

- /r/cleaningupaftersrs did not brigade other subreddits, only those comments which SRS had already brigaded in attempt to reverse SRS's effect. 

The admins have banned /r/cleaningupaftersrs after an SRS user PMed the admins.

[This is the PM an SRS user sent an admin to get /r/cleaningupaftersrs banned](http://i.imgur.com/3aivQ.png)

This is great. Because with this precedent, we can now push the admins to answer as to why SRS itself hasn't been banned. The admins have defined vote brigading as disrupting site activity, which SRS definitely does.

The only difference between /r/cleaningupsrs and /r/shitredditsays is that /r/cleaningupsrs said ""we are a counter-brigade"" while SRS says ""we don't vote brigade ;)"". One is honest, the other is dishonest. They must maintain this lie to maintain their effect on various subreddits they invade.

**THE PETITION**

---

To hueypriest, krispykrackers et al.:

The recent banning of /r/cleaningupsrs has revealed that reddit policy prohibits not just vote brigades, but vote brigades designed to *counter* other vote brigades. /r/shitredditsays is, for all intents and purposes, a vote brigade; the effect SRS has on threads is well-documented, and the people who comment on those threads -- /u/butyourenice, /u/reddit_feminist, and even the subreddit's own mods -- are routinely upvoted to an amount unnatural to the linked subreddit following the linking to their own subreddit.

Since it is reddit policy to ban subreddits that vote brigade, it is only consistent with reddit policy to ban /r/ShitRedditSays. Not only is /r/ShitRedditSays a vote brigade, it attempts to mask this by saying it is not, even though SRS regulars invade threads of other subreddits in plain sight. /r/cleaningupsrs was an attempt to *restore* a subreddit's voting order; SRS's effect is to distort it. So not only is it a vote brigade in line with /r/cleaningupsrs, which was banned for being a vote brigade, it is *worse* than /r/cleaningupsrs because it disrupts activity of *other subreddits* to their own satisfaction. 

To *not* ban SRS would be a selective application of reddit policy. To selectively apply this policy would imply, at the very least, that the administrators on reddit tacitly accept a selective application of the rules in favor of /r/ShitRedditSays, and that they are being inconsistent with their application of rules in a way that favors certain subreddits over others, even if those subreddits break rules.

Because of these reasons, we feel that under this recent exercise of reddit policy, it is consistent with past actions to ban /r/ShitRedditSays for vote brigading and disrupting activity in other subreddits, and banning /r/ShitRedditSays is necessary to maintain consistency."	t5_2uuwv	True

I have a quick question for you:



Would anyone like it, if I posted some of SRS' 'Greatest hits' ?




We have a lot of new users who might not have seen stuff from a few months ago, and there were some serious SRS gold nuggets back then.




I have compiled a list of the most ridiculous / insane / hilarious SRS posts, and would love to share it with you. Some of them might have been posted in /r/antisrs too, but I don't know how many of our users have seen these old posts.



If not too many people are opposed to that. I will definitely post some older stuff, with additional comments from me. 





also, I'm a mod now. Hey community, I promise I am not an SRSer in disguise and I'll do my best to benefit this subreddit and help it grow.

----

SRS is a group of right wing feminists (read: supremacists) who are in support of government-sponsored race/sex/gender/orientation favoritism. 

Unlike leftist and moderate feminists, SRS is not egalitarian. They do not believe in equality; they believe in power reversal, supremacy, and favoritism. 

They also use of the following tactics to fight anyone with differing views:

* Censorship and other ""silencing"" tactics
* Dehumanization
* Infantilization
* Other marginalization tactics
* ""Derailing"" tactics

Much of their rhetoric speaks out against the use of the above tactics... but only when it used against them. They completely support the use of these tactics against their enemies. They justify this behavior in different ways:

* By pretending to do it facetiously or sarcastically as a parody of the way society acts towards minorities.
* ""The other side does it to us, so we're giving them a taste of their own medicine!""

One of the most obvious problems with this explanation upon visiting their subreddits, is that they seem to be incapable of behaving any differently. It becomes apparent **their behavior not so much a parody as it is a crutch, or more likely, even genuine feelings disguised as sarcasm**. By pretending to be semi-joking, they think they can get away with their terrible behavior. ""You can't call me a hypocrite, because this is a circlejerk, so it doesn't count!""  Ironically enough, one of the main reasons they are against people making race/sex jokes is because they believe those sorts of jokes are really just disguises for actual feelings. All they're really doing is describing their own motivations for calling SRS a ""circlejerk"".

Their use of the circlejerk disguise means they tend to make a joke out of their own behavior. They call themselves things like ""The Shevil Fempire"" or pretend they are obsessed with ""Dildz"" (""we love dildos because we hate penises so much, duh!""). This distracts from legitimate criticisms of their group such as concerns over negative behavior and misandry.  Instead of honestly confronting these issues, they can conveniently throw their hands up and with exaggeration exclaim ""OH YES WE ARE LITERALLY HITLER"" rather than having to address real problems like their extremely strict and controlling behavior.

 SRS makes a large caricature of itself and hold it out in front to deflect all dissent. Sort of like an ""Inb4"" mentality crossed with a strawman argument. They would rather dismiss an argument beforehand than have to actually defend their ideas.

They totally lack self awareness. This is partially because their rhetoric is absolutely one-dimensional. Open discussion among their members (let alone from outsiders) is supressed, so they're just an echochamber unable to see themselves from the outside. They refuse to use empathy to try to understand their critics and they never, ever speak out for the ""enemy"" or make concessions. For example: 

* If a man harms a woman, that is proof of our misogynistic (woman-hating) culture and the man is wrong *no matter what, no exceptions*.
* But if a woman harms a man, SRS looks for reasons to support her actions including the use of victim blaming against the male. Also, since violence is part of the patriarchy (male-ruled society), when a woman uses violence, it's still the fault of men.  In other words, men are the root of all evil and women have no responsibility for their actions.



----

SRS has strong cult-like aspects:

* They use esoteric in-group language and buzzwords to quickly and unempathetically categorize all dissenters and outsiders as enemies. These include terms like Shitlord (critic), Neckbeard (male critic), or Special Snowflake (minority critic). This is similar to Scientology's use of terms like ""SP"" or ""Suppressive Person""  which are used to instantly label and discard or target those who don't fall perfectly in line with their beliefs.

* They are also not allowed to openly question or rationally discuss their group's rules and doctrines. Even SRSers biggest and most fervent supporters sometimes get banned for stepping out of line simply by asking calm and honest questions that might undermine the groups dogma. 

----

Rational feminists sometimes get caught in the group. But how, you ask? Wouldn't they see the group's over-the-top, hypocritical, irrational, sometimes absurd behaviors and attitudes and decide to stay away? Well, no. Because, as mentioned earlier, they may perceive much of SRS to be sarcastic and partially joking. 

Feminists may choose to play along with absurd rules (like honest, open discussion being banned) because the main SRS subreddit calls itself a circlejerk. But at it's core, SRS is not a light-hearted circle jerk, it's actually quite serious in nature. So it's not really a circlejerk at all. In practice it acts like a political echochamber where the even the rational feminists begin to lose touch with opposing arguments and ideas. The desire to fit in with people with some-what similar beliefs causes them to fear being banned, so they adopt an attitude that discourages having normal, human discussion. 

It becomes like the [Standford Prison Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment) where a pretend situation changes real behaviors and thoughts. The line between ""circlejerk"" and ""brainwashing machine"" may become increasingly blurred, depending on how involved a user gets with the group, and how much they remove themselves from the outside. 

----

Many feminists don't really understand how weird it gets and how much it affects them until they remove themselves from the situation. Usually against their will. These rational feminists frequently reach a fork in the road when they casually make a reasonable remark that challenges the SRS status quo and as a result they are banned. 

Invariably they will message the mods, but they will have one of two approaches: 

1. ""I am so sorry I stepped out of line, I didn't mean to do it. So sorry, I will never do it again!""
    If they choose this option, they will probably be allowed back into the subreddit, depending on how severely they challenged the status quo. Feminists who choose this path are truly fucked. SRS may unban you once, but a second ban is almost certainly permanent. You only get one warning. Fear of being permanently banned or being labelled a Shitlord by fellow ""feminists"" increases the Stanford Prison Experiment effect and pretty much ensures they will lose what is left of the rational part of their feminism.

2. ""Why am I being banned? This must be some sort of mistake. All I did was say [something reasonable]""
    Oh, you didn't know? This isn't a fucking game. You thought SRS was a place for rational feminists who enjoy being a silly and sarcastic once in a while? You thought wrong. That's just a facade. The fact that you aren't begging for forgiveness, and for some reason you think being reasonable is a good thing, means you aren't fit for SRS. Feminists who undergo this process feel like they're stepping out of The Matrix. They're utterly stunned. Some feel guilty about it for a while, but eventually they start to see the SRS cult for what it is. They often join subreddits like /r/SRSsucks or /r/AntiSRS, which is full of others who help them see how disgusting SRS has always behaved, and they just couldn't see it while they were a part of it.
 
They start to see how extensively SRS uses hypocrisy, doublespeak, distortion of reality, denial of reality, and all of the same derailing-, silencing-, and marginalization- tactics that they speak out against. 

----

**TL;DR - Circlejerks should ALWAYS be TOTALLY lighthearted. When a circlejerk involves serious subject matter, stay the fuck away, it will become an echochamber. Also, if a group bans free speech, stay the fuck away, it will become an echochamber. Circlejerks with serious subject matter that ALSO ban free speech will always become cult-like and they WILL contaminate your thoughts and behavior.**"	t5_2uuwv	True

I don't know if any of you remember, but meta-drama is what killed AntiSRS.

**What is meta-drama?**

Meta drama is when a selfpost is made in this subreddit about a person who posts here, rather than about SRS or something SRS-related.

Here's an easy litmus test. Ask yourself: ""Can this be used to counter SRS in some way? Is this HELPFUL in countering SRS? Does it relate to their prominent users, their practices, or their ideologies?""

If the answer is ""no"", it's probably meta-drama.

**Why is this bad?**

Eventually, the back-and-forth consumes the frontpage and makes SRSSucks an ineffective counter to SRS.

**So what's changing?**

If one person's posts are consumed with complaints about a particular person on SRSSucks and can't seem to post about anything else, we will consider banning them for excessive meta-drama.

- We don't care about lolsail drama

- We don't care about Harriet Potter

- We don't care about Game of Dolls or whatever private subreddit people want to make conspiracies about

Here is what we want: to counter SRS.

I have recently banned Laurelais_Hygiene for Rule #8: excessively ranting about the moderation team, about various users who post here and for creating 100-comment metathreads that waste everyone's focus. If the topic of discussion is sufficiently diverted from countering SRS and everyone's focus is too consumed by witch-hunting a moderator, the mod team will need to force discussion back on SRS.

I strongly dislike SRS. I want that subreddit shut down. We need to highlight more SRS brigades and bring attention to more instances of SRS ridiculousness.

How many men here have been raped, by SJW definitions?"		77	16	43	"I've seen lots of quotes around SRS lately (one from fifthredditincarnati) where rape is however you've interpreted the encounter?

My question: How many men here have been ""raped"" by SJW standards? 

How many men have not been the sober one in a sexual encounter with a woman, where the woman was?

We can all agree that there are _really_ fucked up things that happen to women, and there are some real pieces of human trash out who are out to hurt people, and waste valuable space/air.  There are _also_ plenty of instances of ""rape"" that are overreaching, or a matter of consent revoked after the fact.  In _these specific cases_, these people are conditioned to perceive a lack of agency on their part, and that it was rape.

Back to my original question: __How many of us have been ""raped"" in a way that we didn't feel was rape, but conceivably could have been rape based on the SJW definition?__

I have had sex I'd rather have not have had after the fact, _being drunk_ (and high), and her being sober.  The real kicker was that she was the SJW type, and was one of many during my college years who _apparently_ took advantage of me.  I didn't even give ""enthusiastic consent"", or any consent really, my spinal erection reflex did what it does, as with any other 19 year old male, and my body followed, but that isn't _really_ consent, is it?

Using SRS definitions, I was _certainly_ raped, as I was pretty fucking drunk and couldn't give consent, thus I ought to have reported her to campus administration, no?  

I'm really curious as to what the case is for you men, and considering how much alcohol (among other things) is a part of life for us relatively young people, I'm going to assume that it'll be quite a bit of us, where according to SJWs, _you were in no position to consent_.

What happens, if these SRS types successfully open up this can of worms, and _they're_ the ones being rebuked by a much-more-willing-to-prosecute population of men?  Because ""patriarchy"", we men are _much_ less likely to report something as rape, or domestic assault, because we're told to ""man up"", ""suck it up"", and ""stop being a pussy"", right?  Of course, this has the unintended effect of making us men assume that we have extreme amounts of agency, because _apparently_ we men are always supposed (by the Patriarchy) to be in control, and if we fucked up (even with regretful sex), it's _our_ fault.  Complete agency.

What happens if we're conditioned otherwise, since rape is what we _felt_ the situation was?  

How much ""rape"" is not reported by men, __because men are not conditioned to feel that these loose definitions constitute rape?__

How many lives have we had the ability to destroy, if we _felt_ like it?

[EDIT]

So basically, lots of people here have been on the wrong end of ""rape"".  I'm curious as to how rape-study statistics would change, were all men who have been in this position actually _interpreted_ it as rape.

And for the sake of being really egalitarian, why don't we?  Would we even want to?

Maybe we could be selective, and hold SJWs (but nobody else) to their standards?  How about the next time you're compromised like this, and the person is ostensibly involved in the SJW movement, we report it as a rape, even if just to make these statistics more reflective of reality.

1367662401.0	1do7su	Proof from srs - Reddit is not bigoted, creepy, misogynistic, transphobic, racist or homophobic!	UncleSaddam	79	21	59	"Using the [ShitRedditSays ""new"" page](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/new/) we see that over the last week they have 181 posts of “bigoted, creepy, misogynistic, transphobic, racist, homophobic, or just reeking of unexamined, toxic privilege comments” from Reddit. This averages out to be about 25 a day. [Reddit has some 43 million users](http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/resource-how-many-people-use-the-top-social-media/), 25 comments or even posts a day from a user base that large is statistically insignificant. 

Remember that srsers are actively seeking out offensive posts, and this is all they can come up with. It’s the opposite of what they are trying to prove, their “evidence” shows there is very little racism, sexism etc. on Reddit.


Methodology and other things to take into account:

* According to ShitRedditSays they currently have 36,663 readers. Since they're not all active and to be fair to them in this discussion we'll say 1% of them are active over a given day (This is extremely fair as a higher figure only reinforces the point I'm making). If they want to claim the number of active users is less that’s fine too, it only makes their 36,663 figure even more laughable, either way it doesn't change anything. I’m just using this to point out that they should have at least 366 active users which is more than enough for them to come up with a substantial amount of “bad” posts or comments. They are unable to do this. If 1% of their users found just a single comment daily that was objectionable their weekly total would be 2,562 posts. The actual figure of 181 posts over the last week makes their claims a joke. To top it off I’m even including their posts that are misleading and out of context in these figures.

* To see the number of posts over the last week I'm using the Reddit Enhancement Suite (It may work without it, I haven't tried). It shows the posts by how long ago they were posted, more than 24 hours ago (yesterday) becomes 1 day ago and so going back 6 days ago becomes a week. Over this last week they have only been able to come up with 181 posts or comments (approximately 25 comments a day) worthy of posting. This isn't even just bad posts, it also includes comments that they found objectionable. A single post sometimes has more than one comment that they have found objectionable and they sometimes make separate post for different comments from a single thread. It’s true that there are often more comments that they talk about from the same post but it still comes out that there are about 25 or less total posts daily that they find offensive.

Anita claims that the fact that Star Fox Adventures features a male character in a leading role, with a supposedly strong female character in ""distress"" is sexist and problematic. What she doesn't talk about is why that idea is fucking wrong.

See, back in the late 90s, Rare was working on a game code named: Dinosaur Planet to be released on the Nintendo 64, featuring a female fox as the main character. During the development, the team was visited by Shigeru Miyamoto (the guy behind Mario, Zelda, Donkey Kong, Star Fox and Pikmin). When he was shown what they had come up with so far, he said he was impressed, but mentioned it would be cool to see Fox McCloud on that planet.

This guy had been responsible for the most successful games in history up to that point. What were they supposed to do? They altered the game to shove Fox in the lead role, but kept the female fox in for nostalgia for the developers. Due to the changes they were making, it made more sense to release the game for Nintendo's new video game console.

The change to make Fox the protagonist wasn't due to sexism, it was money. Cold hard cash. See, Miyamoto has a great mind for games. But he's also a businessman. He understands that an expensive new IP ruins an inherent risk of flopping. At the time there was an enormous competition between Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo, and anything you could do to improve the chances of success was going to be taken.

Miyamoto understood that if the average kid walked into a store and saw a game called: ""Dinosaur Planet"" with a purple fox on the cover, he might just walk past it. But Star Fox Adventures, featuring the recognizable hero with the purple fox behind him? Much more likely he'll beg mom for that game. 

So the question of why Krystal became an ""object"" (apparently the word chosen by people to describe non-playable characters or NPCs). Well, Rare wasn't stupid. They know that having two main playable characters is a difficult thing to pull off. See, a lot of time is spent in development creating the gameplay of the main character. If you add a second character, it suddenly either doubles the work, or you cut corners and do a half ass job (Sonic Unleashed, Halo 2, Resident Evil 6, and so on). But on the other hand, if you make their gameplay the same, the question remains why would you bother changing the character other than for the sake of change?

And another thing, Krystal being defeated in the first 5 minutes isn't an example of making her a weak character, or taking away her agency. It's a storytelling technique because up until that point, Krystal had been handling her business, but was still completely overwhelmed by the main bad guy. That adds a sense of danger throughout the game because the player knows that the antagonist doesn't fuck around. And it turns out, at the end, that she was blindsided by Andross, who was basically a evil, magic, force of nature. Ie not at all insulting to be defeated by, considering he had the capability of destroying entire planets. 

See, Rare's decision wasn't out of spite, hatred or sexism, it was business. Making Fox the main character, and the only one they had to worry about from a gameplay perspective gave them the best scenario for success. The unfortunate side-effect was that Krystal wasn't given a chance to really do anything until the next Star Fox game.

So here I bring to you the most bitter, hate-filled, funny, and crazy anti-STEM SRS comments of 2012 in categories I will make up as I go along. It was a great year for the anti-STEMMies, there were many competitors in many categories. But unfortunately only a few can win and we bring them to you, right here, right now. So lets begin!

1) In the category of **""You think STEM is hard?! Let me school you on MY MAJOR boy""** goes to.../u/brdwombyn for her comments on  the difficulties of art [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/14sjvs/if_theres_a_rise_in_stem_and_a_fall_in_the_rest/c7g3pdk)

&gt;*[Yeah, ok [STEM major]. You want to come work on my painting commissions then, because they're obvsly way easy and silly artyfarty fluffy stuff?*

&gt;*AWESOME! THANKS!... FYI it's due in a week! There's also another one due in a few more weeks, and two going up in a gallery show in mid-January! Before you start, I do have to let you know that you will need to have an intimate working knowledge of human anatomy, including knowing every bit and piece of the entire skeletal and muscular systems, how they're put together, how they move, how they bear weight, and how they vary greatly across EVERY SINGLE PERSON EVER. Also, you'll need to have a really fantastic understanding of gravity and how it affects the human body in a multitude of ways.*

&gt;*You also know a lot about the science behind light and color, right? And how to translate light INTO color, right? Because I don't have time to explain that.*

&gt;*Please to be making sure that you understand the chemistry of all the materials used as well. It's oil. It doesn't dry. It cures. Putting the painting by a fan won't speed things up. Also, be sure that you are very well acquainted with all the pigments that will be used. Some of them don't work well together (woo chemistry again. Also rocks.) so you'll need to read up on that before you get to it, I suppose. I guess I should probably let you know that most of these pigments are highly toxic too, so sorry about those 20-hour days you'll be spending working on them.
Just so you know, once you're finally finished, you'll be asked to change some things, so don't get too attached to anything you do. It can be discouraging, but I'm sure that your logical STEM brain won't really have to worry about that, so I don't know why I bothered to mention it in the first place.*

&gt;*I know that's kind of a lot to throw at you, and although it takes YEARS of full-time study, and a lifetime to understand, I know that your superior STEM manbrain can handle it.*

&gt;*...Wait, what's that? No? You can't do that? It's a waste of your time?*

&gt;*lol, ok, have fun being entertained by nothing ever then, because art is a HUGE part of our culture, our lives, and our history. There were paintings before there was science, technology, engineering and math, you know.*

/u/brdwombyn also won the awards for **""Loosest use of the word 'chemistry'""**, and **""Making things up about his/her major/job requirements""**.

Her other post is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/14sjvs/if_theres_a_rise_in_stem_and_a_fall_in_the_rest/c7g4chn): 

&gt;*Yeah, seriously. I was a math major before I switched over to art, and sometimes I wish I had stayed in STEM, because it really was a whole lot easier.*

&gt;*I think painting is the most frustrating thing I've ever done, but it is way more worth it to me. It is probably going to kill me in some way (either from the toxic chemicals, or from malnutrition/lack of sleep/general poor health because I ignore myself for the sake of the job in front of me, or via re-triggering some pretty nasty mental illnesses...Or, you know, the drinking that I feel driven to because all the art I do is SO HEAVY and I just can't hold that all in my body without numbing it...Yeah, probably the drinking...but I digress).*

&gt;*I definitely would be living a much cushier and comfier life if I were still in STEM, because it would not be nearly as demanding, intellectually/mentally/emotionally taxing, physically exhausting or as unhealthy as art is for me.*

&gt;*But damn it. I feel like I'm contributing to the story of humanity as an artist. And that's a lot more valuable than what many STEM majors can claim.*

This second comment won the award for **""Best dissociation with reality""**.


2) Our second category is **""Most bitter""** and it's a very competitive one this year. Let's see the nominees...

/u/UnicornBoogers for her comment found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/zrxla/in_response_to_a_music_major_as_someone_with_a/c6795im):

&gt;*I'm going into Mass Comm. We like to breathe down STEM major's necks, hoping they'll do something stupid so we can spread it to the world. Muckraking ftw.*

/u/garlicstuffedolives for her comment found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/zrxla/in_response_to_a_music_major_as_someone_with_a/c679xk7):

&gt;*As someone with a business degree, get off Reddit and get back to work before I outsource your job.*

/u/Redkiteflying for her comment found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/zrxla/in_response_to_a_music_major_as_someone_with_a/c678hlh): 

&gt;*As someone with a law degree, finish polishing my shoes and fetch my car already, you worthless fucking STEM major.*

We would like to remind our audience that these are all comments in a post about how STEM majors are arrogant assholes.

And the anti-STEMY goes to......./u/Redkiteflying ! 

We chose this winner because she seems to be particularly bitter, even mentioning STEM majors when it is completely irrelevant. Some examples: 

On an post about SRS's lack of sense of humor [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/12eegt/so_a_white_male_posted_something_without_checking/c6udbmu)

On a post about fat-shaming [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/13pqgl/fucking_disgusting_there_is_no_reason_to_become/c761cl5)

On a rape post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/11oyz4/effort_tw_rape_amherst_is_a_shitty_place_reddit/c6oeej6)

On a post about spermjacking [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1036yh/meta_rtrees_thinks_spermjacking_is_real_they_are/c6a0ex9)


So congrats to /u/Redkiteflying for the antiSTEMy! And congrats to the nominees as well, your bitterness is strong too.

3) And the next category is **""Most likely to have dropped out of a STEM major because it was too hard""** goes to.... /u/typon for her post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/nbk7k/women_dont_want_to_be_engineers_thats_why_there/c37vfv6):

&gt;*The reason there aren't more women in Engineering is simple: most engineers are self-absorbed socially awkward misogynistic idiots*

Ooh..you can almost smell the hatred off her. It's as if she is personally offended by STEM majors. Congrats on the award typon and with such hate, you are a shoo in for next years anti-STEMMies as well!

4) Our next category is **""Best armchair psychology attempt about STEM majors while using as many words as possible to say nothing""** goes to..../u/Philip_Stained_Glass for her analysis on the problem with STEMMIES found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/y1tu4/hey_srs_whats_up_with_all_the_stem_hate/c5rpkbp)

&gt;*There's one major reason that STEM needs to be brought down a few notches. A lot of STEMers think they have a monopoly on knowledge, via some ill-defined thing they call ""logic"" or ""reason,"" but what ultimately ends up being just an alogical, intuitive certainty that they are always right about anything, because, like, science.*

&gt;*So when a half-century of incredibly intelligent, meticulously well-thought-out discourse on say, what it means to be a feminist, threatens some STEM dude's sense of his central place in the world--and he figures out it comes from a discourse other than empiricism--he lazily spouts some lazy bullshit about ""equalism."" Not only lazy but also neither logical nor rational. I'm pretty sure the feminist movement has, in fact, used logic (if not Frege and Russel's psuedo-mathematical ""logic"") to determine why it's necessary to be a feminist and not an equalist. They weren't just wandering around with divining rods while they had PMS-induced girl-visions or something. So shut the fuck up.*

&gt;*Basically, this whole New-Atheist-men's-rights-""cult-of-reason""-reddit assemblage just seems to dig up the most crude, obvious, un-nuanced ideas from the French Enlightenment, pretend that no ideas happened in the West since then, and then restate those ideas in the most primitive and shallow ways.
I.e., OMG SCIENCE SHOWS THERE IS NO GOD!! wow what a revolutionary fucking thing to say as a white male in an era when the apparatuses of power have already operated on a materialist, atheist logic for a hundred years.*

This comment was also nominated for **""Post with the most unnecessary commas and quotations""** and **""Post that makes no sense, but we're sure the author meant it that way so that if someone were to say it made no sense she can just claim it's because they are not educated enough""**. Congrats!

5) Our final category is **""Poster most seething with rage""**.

And the antiSTEMY goes to....[deleted] for this post about the vile STEMMERS [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/zrxla/in_response_to_a_music_major_as_someone_with_a/c67bbev)

&gt;*The reason these people hate the arts is the same reason they are disgusting human beings, they refuse to see depth or to expose themselves to another persons world view. They are trapped in their paradigmal nightmares, structures held up by their stubbornness in thinking they know everything with their LogicTM and their NuAtheism. It is why they will always be hatefilled and why they will always be unlovable*

This poster also won an award for **""Most likely to have an aneurysm in the near future""**

Congratulations to all the winners!

1370931739.0	1g3suu	SRS really is slipping if they have to link to fathers who tease about how difficult it is to deal with their daughters growing up.	IAmSupernova	72	12	27	"These types of comments are so common from fathers who struggle with that time in their daughter's life when they start to date and explore their sexuality.  These comments aren't meant to take anything away from the sexuality of women.  These comment are FATHERS who don't want to let go of the innocence, which they have so much pride in protecting, of their daughters.  They also are about not allowing their young daughters to be sexualized (something you would think SRS would be on board with, right?)

Yet somehow SRS found this offensive.  Which I guess makes sense if you think about SRS style feminism as meaning:  white people = bad, men = subhuman filth, internet forums = real life.

The submissions in question are 2 recent posts where SRS attacked some fathers who made a joke about how they are handling their daughters growing up.  The same type of joke that literally every father makes.  Jokes that aren't designed to take away from their daughters going from girls to women, but are meant to highlight how difficult that can be on a father that loves his daughter and would do anything on this earth to protect her innocense.

So [this image]( http://www.livememe.com/ogjx9oh.jpg) was linked to /r/AdviceAnimals.  You'd think SRS would have a problem with the attire for an 8th graders prom sexualizing a child.  But no, we've got a man to hate!   What are these fathers of 8th graders thinking when taking away the sexual agency of their 8th grade ~~daughter~~ woman?

The comments in that meme are a lot of fathers talking about what they will allow their daughter to wear.  I mean, she's in 8th grade.  Dad still gets a say in what she wears, right?

Not where SRS is concerned.  Somehow, if a man (in this case the father of an 8th grader) thinks he has the right to stop this child from wearing clothing that will sexualize her, SRS has a problem with that.  So they link to a comment where a father talks about how he would prefer if his daughter dresses modestly.  (Again, why does SRS have a problem with children not dressing modestly?  I don't know.)

[I may not be a mennonite, but my daughter sure will be.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1g2jcc/took_my_daughter_shopping_for_a_dress_for_her_8th/cag91oe)

[SRS submission]( http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1g3ctr/on_female_clothing_options_i_may_not_be_a/)

So there you have it.  As far as SRS is concerned, fathers, you should allow your 8th grader to dress inappropriately.  And if you discuss dressing your child in a long skirt and modest clothing, you're suddenly oppressing YOUR 8TH GRADER DAUGHTER'S SEXUALITY.

As if that wasn't bad enough, SRS then linked to a post in [this submission]( http://qkme.me/3usl1m) about a man who, while doing laundry (HOLY SHIT A MAN DOING LAUNDRY, GENDER ROLES ANYONE?) finds thongs and he's not sure if they are his wife's or his daughter's.  The post in question:

[I'm so glad I have sons...]( http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1g1jad/16_years_later_edition_everytime_i_do_laundry_as/cafx9tt) however repeated about 10 times. [SRS submission]( http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1g1w2f/on_girls_wearing_thongs_im_so_glad_i_have_sonsim/)

They are so hard up on material that they are linking to a dude who is glad he doesn't have to face his daughter's growing up because he has *gasp* SONS!  HE BROUGHT MORE MEN INTO THIS WORLD!

Also, DAE we shouldn't sexualize children but we should allow children to wear clothes that sexualize them?

So basically, SRS who is supposed to be the champions of erasing child pornography and sexualization of children, is condemning a father who is uncomfortable with his young daughters being sexualized."	t5_2uuwv	True

We are to suppose that this means that I face no adversity. I face no discrimination. There is no one out to oppress me, nor have ""my kind"" ever been oppressed. There is nothing but open doors in front of me. I've got it easy.

On the surface, it may seem like harmless rhetoric, no matter how irrational. But what it does beneath the surface is undermine the legitimacy of mental illness. It reinforces the same attitude that has stigmatized mental illness for the entire history of mankind by acting as if it doesn't even exist. 

I'm bipolar. 

I'm called crazy, insane, nut job, worthless, lazy, unreliable, waste of life, psycho, etc etc. *But I don't know what it's like to be marginalized.*

It can be incredibly difficult to hold down a job. I've managed over the past couple years if not for a boss that understands and a job that isn't too demanding. But I'm aiming for a career, enrolled in school and I must accept that it's possible that I might not actually be capable of maintaining a career as a science teacher. There are days that I simply cannot get out of bed. *But I don't know adversity.*

The NRA just recently stated that I should be put on a national registry, as if I'm some mythical psychopath that could go destruct-o at any moment. There are people that think I should be hospitalized permanently, sterilized and even killed off entirely. *But I don't know what it's like to have troves of people suggest such horrible things.*

No, it's easy being bipolar as a white, straight male. I've never had to deal with hypomania, its direct effects on my social life and its after effects on my finances. I've never had to battle for my life through an episode of severe depression, existing in a breathing purgatory, not wanting to live but not wanting to die. I've never had to deal with an episode of psychosis, where my generally rational brain cannot form a rational conclusion to act on and my behavioral pieces like to fuck with me.

Worst of all, I've never had someone suggest that I commit suicide after learning of my disorder. That shit has never happened to me, I'm a straight white male, *I can't know adversity.*

------

By trivializing my struggle, and the struggle of millions of others that suffer a mental illness, they contribute to the stigma of mental illness; they contribute to the marginalization of those that suffer mental illness. They contribute to the ignorance that perpetuates the stereotypes and myths in regards to mental illness.

All of this does unimaginable damage. Because of these things, there is widespread denial and ignorance of one's own imbalance. I wasn't diagnosed until I was 26, I've heard stories of up to 50. When you're bipolar and have no one around that can or will recognize it's symptoms, you can go a very long time not noticing, even by way of denial. Contributing to this is the stigma, in an effort to avoid being labeled 'one of those crazies.' 

I've been accused offhand as a liar, my story being dismissed as implausible (that it was a publicly funded mental health clinic that got me out of my lifeless hole, on to medication and maintaining a 4.0 in school) and simply being told that it doesn't matter in lieu of my race, gender and sexuality; which is absolutely, by its very definition, an assertion birthed out of racism, sexism, bigotry and explicit ignorance.

&gt;It's important to MRAs because they tend to believe that rape is not very common, and that feminists are trying to redefine consensual sex as rape in order to wield legal power by terrifying men.

She became internationally famous for having started one of the first women’s refuges (called women’s shelters in the U.S.) in the modern world.

Pizzey said that militant feminists—with the collusion of the Labour party’s leading women—hijacked her cause and used it to try to demonize all men, not only in Britain, but internationally.

Pizzey said in 2009 that she has “never been a feminist, because, having experienced my mother’s violence, I always knew that women can be as vicious and irresponsible as men”

* LeftoNhahe was not some SRS long troll false flag or whatever. That IRC screenshot circulating around is almost certainly fake. Lefto was a great contributor here and a good mod for a long while. Yeah, he fell out of favor here for acting unprofessionally as a moderator and antagonizing a huge percentage of our userbase, and because of this he was demodded, but this is not an infrequent occurence with meta subs.

* After he was demodded,  he *did* kinda start trolling our users here, posting opinions that were obviously meant to spark controversy. I can't count the number of times I opened an SRSsucks thread over the past few weeks to find a LeftoNhahe comment downvoted with like thirty children. We hit a breaking point and finally banned him a few days ago, and he deleted his account soon after.

So that's the story. No long troll, no conspiracy theories, just a major contributor who had a falling-out with his community. Now please, for the love of god, stop bringing this issue up. It's giving me a headache and I'm sure that I'm not alone.

* [Jezebel article (copy)](http://archive.is/s7umS)

**SRS post content**

&gt; I often hear of social justice critics (MRAs, many subreddits, the usual suspects) claim that the Social Justice movement is full of bullies and hypocrites. This is to be expected from them, considering their personal vendettas.

&gt; But I'm sort of concerned if there are some within the Social Justice community who are genuinely bad. I read an article in Jezebel magazine about Laci Green, a sex-positive feminist who once used a transgender slur and apologize for it. Self-proclaimed ""social justice"" advocates on tumblr harassed her with death and rape threats, even in one case doxxing her living residence.

&gt; I asked about this on another SJ forum, and was told that the people stirring up hate against Green were actually anti-SJ, anti-trans* people who were recently pretending to be Social Justice. Another mentioned that there are some tumblr types who are pro-SJ, but have a twisted view on what it's supposed to be about.

&gt; Whether or not these folks genuinely believed themselves to be fighting on behalf on oppressed people, their damage was done. Even the best cause can look horrible when assholes take up the banner.

&gt; Regardless, I'm not going to declare Social Justice a lost cause or stop criticizing problematic content. I want to know if there are significant SJ communities, be they genuine or trolls, that I should be aware of and to avoid. I don't want to associate with groups who are transphobic, condone real-life threatening behavior, or otherwise mask unethical conduct under the guise of Social Justice.

**And now for the beautiful response:**

&gt; /u/greenduch had a post about it somewhere, regarding callout culture on tumblr, but the gist of it was:

&gt; *there are some privileged folks on tumblr who use the social justice movement as a way to feel superior. They don't think of it in terms of the real world or how it really affects people, it's just an excuse to bully and flame people on tumblr. this doesn't mean that calling out people is in and of itself wrong, but there are a lot of people who just don't get it and act like they do.*

Let's set up all the data first: 

In this thread srs decides that all women who wear yoga pants do it to be comfortable and that a woman who disagrees is a special snowflake. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/1b10iv/woman_says_that_women_who_wear_yoga_pants_to_work/


In this next one, srs gets all wet over a blog post about a woman taking pictures of men without their permission. Essentially it is guys who sit all stretchered out, probably to avoid someone sitting next to them. The other half are just fat dudes trying to get comfortable so I am not sure why they are there. People who sit like this are annoying as fuck, but if there are no seats available I act like a grown up and say 'excuse me' and they move. 
http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1b17l1/effort_post_redditors_feel_violated_by_swedish/


Now that the examples are given let's examine the reactions. 

1. A picture of a woman in yoga pants is taken without her consent. Srs says this is wrong, she is being objectified and she did not give her permission.
2. A woman says that she wears yoga pants so that men will look at her ass. Srs says that she does not speak for all women. She is a special snowflake and that her opinion is not valid she is just one woman. They wear yoga pants to be comfortable.
3. A woman posts pictures of mens' crotches. Srs is ok with this even though the men have not consented. 
4. Men in the thread say that those men were just sitting to be comfortable. Srs says no, that is not what they are doing. Here is one guy who will speak for all men and say he is comfortable sitting with his legs close. 

Analysis: Srs is ok with candid photos of men and telling them that they don't sit that way just to be comfortable. Srs is not ok with candid photos of women and telling women that they don't choose those pants just to be comfortable. IPSO FACTO IT IS MISANDRY ~QED~ ~FIN~

Some choice double standard quotes:

&gt;As a white cis-male who used to wear baggy jeans and listen to misogynic hip hop as a teenager, I'm fully aware that this behaviour simply is a way to claim public space and intimidate people and that it's got nothing to do with the size of your scrotum. But reddit disagrees;

.
&gt;Lol I cross my legs all the time when I sit. My girlfriend has asked me if it hurts, but it honestly never has. I don't understand this... stereotype? myth? that men have to sit with their legs spread apart. I have never crushed my own normal-sized testicles by crossing my legs or not sitting spread-eagle.  

.
&gt;yes clearly every other woman is lying and this woman can speak for everyone good job  
  
.
&gt;Since we all know ""truth"" and ""conventionally held neckbeard wisdom"" are actually interchangeable, I'd say this checks out.   
 
.  
&gt;You're a chick??? Well that changes everything! Thank you for being such a special snowflake spokesperson for all us chicks! What would we do without you to explain to the menz that it's all our own fault when we get creeped on? I mean, we're just asking for it, amirite?

&gt;&gt;KW - Yeah, they didn't seem to see that the film had a different message than those stories. 1984 is about socialism; Fahrenheit 451 is about McCarthyism - subjects which I don't think have any resonance today - whereas Equilibrium is about something else: in America right now there's a trend among people or the government to try and control what we feel. There's a tongue-in-cheek saying, ""Your rights end where my feelings begin,"" and in America it's scarily true because we're less and less able to voice what we feel. Look at so-called 'hate crimes.'

I got banned from SRSD in like...two posts. Basically, there was a thread about how r/gentlemanboners (and the media/porn industry in general) are racist because white women are the most popular when it comes to sex symbols. Never mind that the majority of the Western world IS white, the disparity is obviously due to racism. Porn is racist because white women aren't identified as ""white"", just being standard. White dolls are racist. White beauty symbols are inherently racist.

Now, I'm a 3/4 black person (dad is black, mom is mulatto). I am very aware of racial issues that permeate society and I love discussing them. However, I don't just blindly agree with every single ""anti-racist"" sentiment because that's obviously illogical. So when I saw this thread, I had something to say. Verbatim, I said:

&gt;All over the world, people are attracted to people that look like them. That's never going to change. People can just not be attracted to a certain kind of race, or be attracted to some more than others, without being overtly racist. So why is it only a problem when whites find their own race attractive more so than others? Why does every single white male have to be entirely neutral when it comes to such a subjective matter, but it's just fine for minorities to do the same thing?

Of course, there's a lot more to the argument to what I've posted here. I don't think I displayed hate, or white supremacism, or racism at all...I was just explaining that the entire concept of ""more white sex symbols = racist"" was logically flawed and an unfair attack on every single person with a white significant other.

So of course, I got banned immediately (I'm not going to single out the mod). That was it. I messaged a mod and asked why I was banned. Response? ""Because you sharted out a bunch of racism on a new account."" It's almost like they're parodies of theirselves. I then elaborated on my original point, and explained how I wasn't racist or self-hating, I just wanted to challenge some of the ideas being presented. I believe that liberally throwing the word ""racist"" around like they did is dangerous because it makes outsiders take ACTUAL racism less seriously. Even if I agree with someone, I'll still challenge their ideas if they're making bad arguments. I just wanted to explain to the mod that I believe their cause would be furthered by consistent debate and discussion instead of just echoing everyone else that agrees with you.

His/her response? ""k."" and that was it.

SRS sucks. Do they realize that for all their ""activism"" and ""progressiveness"" they're only retarding (oops, gotta check my privilege again) real progress by demonizing everyone that disagrees with them?

&gt; I've found very positive experiences with college debate in terms of how accepting they are. **The topic this year is about energy production** but the way the game is framed actually brings in a whole slew of new ideas.

&gt; Essentially, **the resolution (topic) can be critiqued according to feminist, marxist, or black power types of thought**. One of the debaters on our team is putting together a **Chicana Feminism kritik**. A black student runs a hip-hop negative **where he argues through hip-hop instead of speech** because, in his words, hip hop gives a voice to the voiceless.

The post in question was from AskReddit, and it asked **""What's one question you've been dying to ask another race but never do because you're afraid of the impending ""THAT'S RACIST!"" aftermath?""**

I guess SRS just couldn't resist such a goldmine to phish for an expose of racist bigotry.

My naivety was squashed and hope for humanity faltered.  Needless to say I was banned. Ask me anything of my experience.

EDIT (the story as told to /u/SS2James): 

It went well at first. We somehow got on politics. I expressed that while all types of government have certain advantages and disadvantages, they are all ruined by people not doing their part for their fellows. Later, they got on the topic of misandry. I stated that true social justice can never be accomplished due to peoples individual prejudice, such as one's dislike of men. The mods flipped the discussion table at the mere mention of a 'oppression' as they called it existing toward white males. 

Evidently there was a fight to let me return. Some enjoyed the discussion I suppose. So they made a Bobert channel where I continued my thesis for those that wished to talk. Eventually, historical racism in America came up; circle jerking from the audience ensued. I made the remark of 'living in the past won't do you good. It shouldn't have a bearing on the now' (not the exact words). A mod of this Bobert channel made an ultimatum stating that I would take part in the circle jerk or suffer banning. I took the banning.

Not that exciting. The reason I thought this was warranted posting was the banner and the passive aggressive taunting and mocking that kept me amused through the ordeal.

The other day /u/iheartbakon posted a little meme that I thought was pretty funny.  It made me think that we need a place that branches off from here that is more of a straight parody.  The picture he posted set things in motion to make such a place by giving it a title.  So without further ado...

/r/AngryBrds

/r/AngryBrds principle focus is to post things that are only tangentially relatable to SRS.  Granted, you can still post anything SRS/BRD related there so long as it's funny.  But the main goal is going to be linking to posts, blogs, videos, what have you, that depict an Angry BRD.  Stuff that doesn't necessarily fit the narrative of SRSSucks or doesn't really have anything to do with SRS but that most of the community here would be interested in or find funny.

Memes are very much welcomed and encouraged.  Links to sites and blogs off of Reddit where a BRD has flown into a hilarious clamfit over some ridiculous microaggression is perfectly acceptable content.  Links to videos (think: Anita Sarkeesian or UofT's Red Menace) where a BRD in the real world puts on a display of nonsensical clamrage are other things we're looking for to be posted there.  

Whenever you say to yourself ""this hilarious/interesting thing isn't really related to SRS, but I know the folks at SRSSucks would find it hilarious/interesting"" now you know where to put it.

SynisterBaconLord	72	23	13	"So, some background, I work security as an unarmed guard, and one of my supervisors is a black man who's known to be an irritating ass to all the white males in the company, but just the coolest guy in the world to everyone else, even the objectively shitty ones. Fortunately, he doesn't supervise any of my shifts, he does however supervise all the shifts of another guard on my site. There are a lot of sites my security company works for though, so sometimes you won't see these supervisors for weeks at a time, they just drop in randomly for post checks. This other guard isn't the brightest, but he's alright, which has made him a bit of a target for this supervisor. He wasn't really aware of this supervisor's habits, nor that his boss is somewhat aware of his biases so his reports on the white guards are taken with a grain of salt. I informed the guard that this supervisor is racist and informed him of the ""shuck and jive"" technique, telling him that way back when, black slaves would perform this technique against their masters, which involved smiling and nodding and agreeing with them until they were not paying attention and then just not obeying anymore, within reason.

So there you have it, I imparted ""cultural appropriation"" to help my white co-worker deal with his black racist supervisor. I think this is the kind of thing they have nightmares about. It was my privilege.

With bonus input from our favorite SRStard, TIOL!

&gt; Trust Lena Dunham to work rape into her show. Just...wow.

&gt; I'm of the mindset that tossing out rape scenes wily-nily doesn't exactly work to get people talking about rape, though. It just enforces rape culture.

Depicting rape in media (even critically or non-exploitatively) just enforces rape culture. Glad we sorted that one out.

Its as if they are all actually men hoping to make all of feminism look so stupid that no one will want to associate with the word anymore (because that is what it is doing). 

I find r/atheism doing the same thing as r/shitredditsays, but for religion, and both are equally hurting their own causes. 

Why do we give the loudest voices to the dumbest, most extreme people?

Thoughts?

I would also like everyone to list some of the most ridiculous words they started using.. for humour's sake.

Some I love are:

- Neckbeards

- Shitlords

- HUrrrrrrr (the fuck is that sound supposed to be) 

- Benned (I am more offended they took Star Wars and tried to use it as means to promote their skewed version of feminism than any of the times I was actually banned).

1371847601.0	1gtg5k	Be outspoken. When you stand up to bullies, you give courage to those around you to do the same. A quick lesson from Hacker News.	vitamin_see	56	8	34	"I frequent a discussion forum called [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). It focuses on programming, startups, and science.

About a year ago, I noticed that the site was increasingly flooded with extremely aggressive, accusatory comments from social justice bullies, primarily relating to their absurd notions of sexism.

Just like the bullies you deal with here on Reddit, those bullies would preemptively declare that unless you belong to one of their designated victim groups, your objections are automatically invalid. In fact, the act of even trying to object was oppressively stifling, because you were ""drowning out"" women's voices. In short: Unless you're a woman, _shut the fuck up_. If you are a woman, shut the fuck up unless you're toeing the line, lest you be bullied with the ""special snowflake"" label.

Their bullying worked.

It became more and more painful to read the site. Occasionally, someone would timidly try to disagree with them, peppering their comments with apologies and needless qualifiers, desperately hoping not to be attacked or accused of sexism. Sensing weakness, as bullies do, those posters would be ripped to shreds.

A few months ago, I noticed a few people standing up to the bullies. They didn't qualify their arguments, and they weren't apologetic for disagreeing. As silly as it sounds, this strategy hadn't occurred to me!  I had avoided confrontation my whole life, and there are few things more confrontational than standing up to an angry, self-righteous mob.

Nervously, I signed up and jumped in, _and it felt incredible._ Rather than feeling frustrated whenever I saw the feminist bullies descend upon a thread, I felt excited. It was an opportunity to stand up for myself and for people who I _knew_ were too timid to stand up for themselves, and nothing feels more empowering than that. Nothing.

My excitement did not predicate upon how well my posts were received; in fact, I expected to be downvoted heavily. But to my surprise, my posts were almost universally upvoted. My more aggressive posts tended to perform better, receiving +20, +30, or +40, especially when I was responding to a particularly aggressive bully to begin with. For a while, most of the _replies_ I received were from the bullies themselves, but as time went on, more and more people felt safe voicing their grateful agreement openly, rather than by hiding behind upvotes.

In summary, do not limit your commentary to this subreddit. Outside of /r/srssucks, there are plenty of people feeling too timid and too disempowered to stand up to the bullies.

**DISREGARD THIS, I SUCK COCKS! (The classics are always the best are they not?)**

[The admins want us to take the meme down.](http://i.imgur.com/BFVRX.png) So we're forced to ban it. Sorry.

I will leave the rest of the post here for posterity but it's no longer relevant. The meme is banned, we have no say in this, it's an admin decision.

**UPDATE 2**

[Here's the full exchange with the admin from the modmail.](http://i.imgur.com/xoBtQ.png) Make of it what you will.

***

There has been even more controversy surrounding that meme now that the alleged subject of the photo - who claims to be friends with Laurelai - is posting on Reddit saying she's unhappy with the photo being passed around and she does not share any beliefs with SRSers.

First, let me make one thing clear. As far as me, ddxxdd, and the other mods are concerned, that image is no worse than any other meme. All the memes featuring real people use images pulled from the internet without the knowledge of the subject of the photo. Furthermore, they don't consider whether or not the person in the photo actually believes the things the meme is about. There are [far worse memes out there to take your anger out on](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4278427/Web-trolls-put-picture-of-Downs-Syndrome-girl-on-Facebook-with-vile-caption.html) (thanks ddxxdd) if you dislike this, and anyone who takes issue with how the memes are produced should contact /r/AdviceAnimals, not us.

Second, we have no way to verify this poster is actually the subject of the photo. None whatsoever. Anyone can make a sockpuppet account and play ""I'm Sparticus"", claiming they were in the photo, but there's no proof of anything.

Third, that photo is still not against Reddit's rules. The subject of the photo was not doxxed and photos themselves do not constitute doxxing, therefore no rules are being broken.

So **the official position is we will not be removing those memes.** However, out of courtesy, we do suggest using an alternative, perhaps utilising SRS's ""Brd"" image as opposed to a real person.

Thank you and enjoy your Reddit."	t5_2uuwv	True

&gt;Good point about that male sexuality though. Imagine a world in which men aren't judged for how many sexual partners they've had. Imagine a world in which men can walk around in shorts and no shirt without being called a slur who's asking to be raped. Imagine a world in which men are free and even expected to view pornography without being shamed. That world could be a reality someday.

&gt;Oh look! It's here.

What the hell? If a guy has sex with a lot of women or has a lot of one night stands, he will be branded a player or people will say ""you need to get tested."" From my experience, players are not respected at all.

If a guy walks around without a shirt, everyone is going to think he is a douche. It's only culturally appropriate for a guy to take off his shirt if he's working out. And only guys who have 10% body fat or less can take off their shirts without being mocked for being chubby. Does this SRSer seriously not know what it's like to be a man? Also, women can walk around without wearing a shirt in many countries. Where does this lady live? 

Men can view porn, and women can too. No one cares if you watch porn. Seriously, does she think that everyone is judging her for watching porn? This is so ridiculous."	t5_2uuwv	True

DedicatedAcct	63	18	17	"These days, women vote in larger numbers than men in the United States. This is part the ""voting gender gap,"" a topic which I've never, not once, seen come up in conversation with any of our most favorite gender studiers. The voting gender gap is the difference between how men and women vote. [Gallup](http://www.gallup.com/poll/158588/gender-gap-2012-vote-largest-gallup-history.aspx) showed the largest voting gender gap in history in 2012, where the female electorate overrode the male electorate by a 20 point margin and [elected Barack Obama 55 to 44%](http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_12.html) where the male electorate tried to elect Mitt Romney 52 to 45%. 

2012 isn't the only time that the female electorate has done that. They also did it in [2008](http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_08.html) and [1996](http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_96.html). 

What about the other years? Well generally the male and female electorate agree with each other. The recent exceptions to this were the 2000 and 2004 elections where women voted by a very small margin for Gore and then again, by a very small margin for Kerry and men voted by larger margins for Bush. And, if you think about it, the 2000 election was essentially decided by the Supreme Court and not by men *or* women. 

Regardless of the outcome of any given election, 1980 was the most recent time that the male voter turn out was larger than the female voter turn out, with the electorate being [51% male and 49% female.](http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_80.html) Compare that to the most recent election where the electorate was 53% female and 47% male.

I'm left asking how anyone can refer to our society as a patriarchy when laws and leaders are chosen by women, who not only control the vote but also have demonstrated the power and ability to vote against men and win. I get that this information might be inconvenient to Patriarchy Assertion but when will it be welcome news?

'Nkosi Thandiwe shot dead 26-year-old Brittany Watts and and injured two other women in the parking deck of the Proscenium building on July 15, 2011.
 His trial went to court this week.

 Thankiwe confessed that he shot the three white women after he **learned to hate white people in college.**

 The Atlanta Journal Constitution reported:

 During his testimony Wednesday, 
 Thandiwe suggested that his reason for even purchasing the gun he used in the shootings was to enforce beliefs he’d developed about white people during his later years as an **anthropology major** at the University of West Georgia.

“I was trying to prove a point that Europeans had colonized the world, and as a result of that, we see a lot of evil today,” he said. “In terms of slavery, it was something that needed to be answered for. I was trying to spread the message of making white people mend.”


He said the night before the shooting, he attended a so-called “Peace Party” intended to address his concerns about helping the black community find equal footing, **but two white people were there**.

Nkosi Thandiwe was found guilty of murdering a woman and wounding two others in a 2011 Midtown shooting spree was sentenced to life without parole plus 65 years in prison.'

Notice the girls shot were prime SRS material - young white college chicks doing liberal arts degrees and attending a multicultural 'peace party'. This didn't stop them having their privilege checked in the most extreme way by a disadvantaged PoC that their own ideology had taught to loathe *all* white people for historical crimes. Remind you of anyone?

So I get to digging. Well I'll be damned. They aren't being satirical at all! What the fark is this crap then? How can so many people be so self absorbed and all have the same twisted views? The inconsistencies are abundant, the minority defines the majority? what?

It felt like I was knocked unconscious and woke up in some religious extremist group. I couldn't stand up because I kept slipping on the idiocracy. 

That notwithstanding. SOMETIMES someone would have a point. But their comment is so littered with insults and degradation, totally ruining any credibility they might have gained. 

Since then I've honed into the r/mensright subreddit, and it's so full of nice that it's hard to explain. Disagreements are supported with full references. There's acceptance when someone is proven wrong or misguided. Meanwhile, SRS just feels like a bunch of trolls trolling each other for the troll of it. Trolljerk??idk

Anyway, just wanted to throw that out there as it just buggers the crap out of me.

1376444414.0	1kbj9s	Victimizing minorities and women is not going to help them.	i_suck_at_name	52	7	23	"I can't think of a single person who has achieved anything for women or minorities by making them feel like victims.  And yes, sitting around crying about anyone who says something offensive is being a victim.  Martin Luther King didn't lead the civil rights movement by sitting around crying about how racist white people were.  He did it by encouraging all races to stand up for justice and unity.

  People who victimize themselves are viewed as weak, which can be justification for racism/feminism.  You're hurting your own goals.  If you really want to fight racism and feminism, then lead by example and be someone that anyone of all races or genders can look up to and respect.  Show people you're not just a whiny victim.  Be the light you want to see in the world.  That's the only way anything ever changes.

TL;DR:  victimizing yourself isn't as effective as leading by example"	t5_2uuwv	True
1376103356.0	1k2hkx	"Today's Occam's razor challenge: Did people ""suddenly realize (for a split second) that they are horrible"", or was this brigaded by SRS?"	porygon2guy	56	9	10	"So, yesterday, [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1jyr0d/underage_girl_claims_she_is_age_of_consent_and/) thread was posted to /r/MensRights, in which the OP is routinely downvoted and is eventually banned by the mods.

19 hours ago, [this](http://redditlog.com/snapshot/15802/20604) thread is posted to /r/SubredditDrama, in which the vast majority of the comments echo the same sentiment shared by the posters in /r/MensRights- that they're disgusted by the thread OP.  Obviously good, yes?  Means we won't have to deal with an SRS thread talking about how all ?

Nope.

[This](http://redditlog.com/snapshot/15783/20605) comment, posted 12 hours ago, was [submitted](http://redditlog.com/snapshot/15784/20606) to SRS 6 hours ago.  At the time of it's submitting, the score was +19.  Now, 6 hours after the SRS thread was posted, the score has dropped to -20 at the time of writing this.  In addition, the scores of comments critical of /u/Pupmup have gone up in karma as well.  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/NqLHgP7.png) is a compilation showing the downvoting and upvoting of comments; on the left is the screenshot from SRS, on the right is my screenshot from the time of this writing.

[SRS screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/SPMXvuK.png), for additional comparison of upvoted/downvoted comments.

The biggest piece of evidence isn't just the sudden swings in comment scores, it's the timing. 

[Observe](http://i.imgur.com/nMsKN7v.png), the voting graph from SRSscreenshot.  This handy dandy little graph shows voting patterns for the comment linked to SRS.  I figured out what the time was for me (my time zone is Eastern, the bottom-most time of the two times listed).  As you can see, /u/Pupmup posted his comment roughly at 9:00 AM, and received a positive score up until roughly 4:20 PM, about 20 minutes after his comment was posted to SRS.  From there his score dropped to -20.

So class, let's use Occam's razor and figure out the cause of this.  Did SRD posters downvote his comment 6 hours ago despite it staying in the positive for 6 hours prior?  Or was it downvote brigaded by SRS 20 minutes after a thread about it was posted to SRS?"	t5_2uuwv	True

1375042298.0	1j8d2x	[Meta] Why is the C-word offensive?	ArchangelleNiggatron	59	11	55	"For those of you at work, I'm talking about ""cunt.""

Seriously, why? Urbandictionary defines it as a ""Derogatory word for Women, considered by many to be the most offensive word in the English Language."" Even worse than the word ""Nigger?"" Were millions of women systematically dehumanized, killed, and forced to labor for hundreds of years in America? When a woman hears the word ""cunt,"" does she immediately get a flashback to the 1910s when she couldn't vote? The way I see it, ""cunt"" is ""the most offensive word in the English language"" because women made it so. It's not a charged word full of a history of oppression and hatred. It's just a rough, harsh word that starts and ends hard. I asked my best friend why she thought being called a cunt was offensive, and she said ""it just is."" The way I see it, ""cunt"" is no more an offensive word than ""fuck,"" and you know how much BRDs love to use the word ""fuck."" 

&gt;SHUT THE FUCK UP, FUCKFACE

I seriously believe that women hold ""cunt"" as such an offensive word *for little to no reason at all but just to have it as an offensive word.*

In the words of [Bill Burr] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNSt3wJXZk0): ""In their mind they start concocting this desperate, *HAIL MARY* attempt to make you **SO FUCKIN' MAD** you just call 'em a cunt. 'ts what it is! And 'cunt' trumps ALL the bullshit they did to start the argument. 'Now it's not about that, there's no reason to call me a cunt' and that's it you're in this room now.""

Please, SRSsucks. Change my view. Call me out on my ignorance. Am I wrong? Am I right? I'd much rather hear it from you."	t5_2uuwv	True
