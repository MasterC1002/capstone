She moved closer to me so I wouldn't have to drive so far to pick up/drop off my kids, so I'd like to do something nice for her in return.  My plan is to stock her pantry for her so they have everything they need to make simple meals.  What are some things I can buy to stock them up?

Update:  Thanks for the suggestions.  I probably should've just gone to the store and decided by myself... these comments made me spend way too much, lol.

The way I see it, many of the interesting challenges of a limited cupboard can be solved by application of a relatively small set of long lasting base ingredients and spices, and while it might reduce activity in the subreddit (a bad thing), I do feel it is in the spirit of its intention.

Tomorrow begins my spring break, so I had some random food I had to eat together so it wouldn't go bad over break.  I made a delicious 1 pan meal for two to eat over rice.  List of food I had to eat:

* Cheese Sauce (I had made it earlier this week)

* 1/2 onion

* 2 eggs

additional ingrediants:

* rice
* frozen chicken

I cooked the 1 dry cup of rice in my rice cooker.  I cut short onion slices and cooked them in butter.  I then beat the eggs, and scrambled them in the same pan.  I added the frozen chicken and the cheese sauce, then ate the whole thing over the rice.  I wish I had taken a photo to share, but I was too darn hungry."	t5_2tnbc	True
1330794269.0	qg1ca	Parents away for the weekend... [Dinner]	breeks	22	4	4	"...so it's time to cook! 

Dad loves cooking and as much as I enjoy the meals he makes it leaves me very little opportunity to make anything of my own but now I've got the kitchen to myself and I'm ready to make something tasty that can hopefully impress my parents when they come back.

Only problem is that I've been left (what seems to me) a very ragtag mixture of ingredients - that's why I need your guys help! So without further ado, here is what I have:

* A full spice rack, a shit load of herbs, seasoning, ketchup and mayo
* 20 rashers of bacon
* 12 cumbernauld sausages
* 3 eggs
* A big ass chorizo
* Snap peas
* Baby sweetcorns
* Egg noodles
* Conchiglie pasta
* Tinned chopped tomatoes
* Chillies
* Refried beans
* Milky bar desserts (shit is SO cash)
* 1 jar of hot doritos salsa
* 1 jar of bbq doritos salsa
* 1 bag of cool original (cool ranch in US I think) doritos
* 1 bag of chili heatwave (don't know US name for these) doritos
* Lettuce
* Red bull
* 6pts of milk
* Greek yoghurt
* Crunchy nut cereal
* Roast potatoes
* Carrot and swede mash
* 3 tins of tuna

Sorry if the list isn't that well ordered - it was written from memory (at library just now). I *can* go to the shop if there is some dish screaming out of the list that I'm missing the vital ingredient for but I'd rather not as I don't drive. 

If anyone could help me out I would appreciate it immensely!

In general, due to work I don't get much time to cook, except on weekends. So my kitchen is pretty much empty and only buy stuff on an as-needed basis.

However, sometimes hunger gets a hold of me and I always resort to junk-food even though I have a kitchen. This has to stop! So I ask you here, what would be good items to have (or even must-haves), which don't spoil after 2-3 days, and how should I properly store them?

Preferably items which allow me to quickly whip something up. I'm a bachelor and don't need fancy food ;)

I am more than a little stumped.  I receive WIC benefits for myself and my two sons (3 and a half and 3 months).  We normally eat very healthy, with a meat/veggie/starch for lunch and dinner, and cereal for breakfast.  Lots of fresh fruit for snacks.  I am breastfeeding, though, and am CONSTANTLY hungry.

Milk
Eggs
Cheese
Frozen Juice Concentrate
Cereal (Frosted Shredded Wheat, Rice Square, Grape Nuts)
Oatmeal
Canned beans
Canned Salmon
Canned Tuna
Whole Wheat Bread

1359919125.0	17tifv	What to do with chorizo?	sethra007	12	0	13	"So out of curiosity, I purchased 2 lbs of Mexican chorizo a few weeks agfrom a local Hispanic grocery.  I'd had chorizo and eggs before, and had vague ideas of recreating the dish.  I put it in my freezer until I could experiment.

I planned to make a quick beef stew for supper today, but when I went to the refrigerator to get it, I discovered that I'd accidentally thawed the chorizo instead.  I'd like to use it if I could.

I have basic beef stew ingredients (carrots, white onion, new potatoes, beef broth).  I also have:

* Eggs
* frozen mixed vegetables
* canned chickpeas
* canned kidney beans
* canned black beans
* generic chili seasoning
* cumin
* coriander
* dried oregano and basil
* paprika 
* garlic powder 
* sweet chili sauce
* black bean sauce
* (Honestly, I have a metric assload of spices and sauces; name it, and there's a 50% chance it's in my spice cabinet)
* soy sauce
* chicken broth
* canned tomatoes
* tomato paste
* quinoa
* a bag of lentils
* quick grits
* canned mushrooms
* a big sweet potato (this thing must be a pound, at least)
* jarred white asparagus (another ""I'll experiment with this"" purchase)
* 1 can pork and beans
* some molasses
* some maple syrup
* rotini pasta
* ramen noodles


Suggestions?

EDIT: I also have some dried ancho chilies, a small can of jalepenos, and some sundried tomatoes in oil.

**EDIT** : Alright, cooked the burgers. I fried some garlic in butter, then coated the burgers in that, with steak spice, and pepper. Cooked for 10 mins on one side in my little oven. 

Then with the remaining butter, i added some soy sauce, and a dash of sriracha sauce. re coated both sides in that mix, flipped burger and baked for another 15.

The results were Fucking delicious!

I have some things I just haven't cycled out of my cabinet in a while, and I'm hoping to use those up first. The bulk of what I have is as follows:

VEGGIES: celery, carrots, onions (no brown potatoes though, more's the pity) two sweet potatoes

CARBS:  puff pastry (two full rolls), pie shells (three), rice (brown and white), pasta (egg noodles, spaghetti and fettucine)

MEAT: turkey bacon (tons), two chicken legs, canned tuna (tons)

EXTRAS: a full spice rack, and a variety of things for sauces (butter, milk, cooking wine, instant gravy, soy sauce, vinegar, beef, veggie and chicken stocks, etc), peanut butter, jar of spaghetti sauce, all baking supplies, and half a cup of shredded mozzarella 

I was in the mood for a nice steak and ale pie or a pot of chicken soup, but I don't have enough meat for those; however, I think I have just enough to flavor some kind of sauce or stretch it into some kind of vegetable soup. I suppose I could fry up some rice with either the tuna or chicken legs, but I'm not used to working w/ dark meat and I don't know how best to stretch or apply the chicken. My favorite dish of last week was chicken marsala, and I have leftover ingredients for that besides the chicken; I was wondering if there's a way to incorporate the veggies I have into something similar.

1333510590.0	rsbws	I made stuffed shells, and have extra filling!	hypnofed	8	0	7	"I have a question in a different form than post people ask.

This always happens to me.  I've made a wonderful pan of baked stuffed shells, but as always, I made way more filling that I have shells to stuff.  I'm looking for something to do with the excess filling that isn't the same concept in a different shape.  For example, I consider lasagna and ravioli as essentially the same as stuffed shells, just shaped differently.

For reference, the filling has:

ricotta cheese, asiago and mozzarella cheese, two eggs, italian seasonings, salt, pepper, sauted mushrooms, ground beef, some half and half

The consistency of the filling is about what you'd expect to use to stuff shells or manicotti or ravioli.

Assume I have a well-stocked pantry with a lot of staples.  If you tell me I need something that's reasonably priced, I can get it at my supermarket.  I just don't want to waste all this extra filling I have.

1357159378.0	15uf0q	Need help planning some meals for 2 for the weekend and freezer meals for the future.	sunkan	6	2	4	"Hey guys,
So, I've somehow ended up with no budget left to spend on food for the month (or, at least until my next paycheck in 2 weeks).  I coupon so I have a bit of a stockpile built up, so it's okay.  My boyfriend is coming back from winter break this weekend (we're uni students), so I'll need to cook for the both of us for a few days.  He has a meal plan, so he can swipe me into the school cafeterias to even out some meals, but the school cafs don't open until next Wednesday.  Also, dorm food can get kind of boring, so I wanted to make some freezer meals (homemade tv dinners type of deal).  

I have some meals planned out in my head, but I'll list what I have right now then write my plans afterwards to ask for suggestions or feedback :) 

**Grains:**

* Short grain rice
* [A plethora of pastas (all the boxes are full)](http://imgur.com/puDnH) - i already finished off the bowtie though. and i also have some piccolini, 2 bags of spaghetti, dried rice noodles, and some soba noodles.
* [Some steamer bag rice](http://imgur.com/QUIMs)
* [This ""germinated brown rice"" that I don't know how to cook...](http://imgur.com/q0w5z) - so, would also like to know how to cook this.  haha
* some mini wheat croissants
* Total Whole Grain cereal

**Dairy**

* Sour cream (2- 8 oz tubs of Daisy)
* 8oz block of colby jack cheese
* 32oz almond milk
* 4 cans evaporated milk
* 15 oz eggbeaters (original flavor)
* 1 gal 2% milk
* Butter
* Chicken fat
* Beef fat

~~note: i'm slightly lactose intolerant, so that's why I don't have any ""real"" milk.  but i am a barista and can get milk (2%, skim/fat-free, half&amp;half, or soymilk) for free (up to 24oz) from work. ~~ &lt;- as I wrote this post, a coupon for a free gallon of milk from my local superstore was released.  So I'm going to pick up a gallon of 2% milk! (unless people suggest another type of milk)

**Produce**

* 5lbs of yellow potatoes - they were on sale.  but after bringing them home, a lot of them have eyes... grr.  haha, so would prefer suggestions/recipes where they are skinless. 
* [These steamer veggies](http://imgur.com/IHh2m) - ""Shoepeg White Corn &amp; Butter Sauce"", ""Sweat Peas"", ""Chopped Spinach""
* 3lb bag of yellow onions
* 2lb bag of carrots
* A bunch of mushrooms that I froze a few months ago (maybe 4-5lbs?)
* [A bunch of canned tomatoes](http://imgur.com/HbDQ9) - 2 petite diced, 2 diced, 2 paste
* Fresh Ginger

**Meat**

* ~.5lb Ball tip steak
* 4 big country style ribs
* A whole chicken (4.69lbs)
* 4lbs top round steak
* [5 cans of spam](http://imgur.com/UJqd1) - 1 original, 1 hickory smoke, 2 bacon, 1 turkey
* 4 pouches (2.6oz each) of tuna
* Oxtail
* Beef hooves
* Misc beef bones

**Other stuff**

* [4 boxes of mac &amp; cheese](http://imgur.com/LSQe8)
* [3 packets of Ortega Taco Seasoning](http://imgur.com/LSQe8)
* [3 cans of Progresso Clam Chowder](http://imgur.com/HbDQ9)
* [4 cans cream of x](http://imgur.com/HbDQ9) - 2 cream of chicken, 1 cream of potato, 1 cream of mushroom]
* Instant Tofu Miso Soup
* Itailian Breadcrumbs
* Chicken Stock
* Beef soup
* [Honey Citron Concentrate](http://www.posharpstore.com/en-US/hanasia-citron-honey-tea-22-lbs-p2786.aspx)

**Baking stuff**
not sure the exact amount I have of each, but I have quite a bit...

* White flour
* Brown sugar
* Truvia
* Honey
* Coconut flakes
* [Some asian flours](http://imgur.com/fCEyR) - one used to make har kow, another used to make steamed buns
* Baking soda
* 3 packets of unflavored gelatin
* ""Best Blend"" Oil (canola and vegetable oil combined)
* [Asian pudding mixes](http://imgur.com/u0pOV) - one ""purin"" and one ""black sesame""
* Instant Pancake Mix
* Maple Syrup

**Seasonings/Spices**

* Ground Black Pepper

* Curry bouillon
* White Wine vinegar
* Soy sauce
* Fish Oil

**Beans**

* Red beans
* Roasted &amp; Unsalted Sunflower Seeds
* Organic Adzuki Beans &amp; Pearl Barley (like mixed together, it's one package)
* Dried Barley
* Dried Green Beans

I also have some [beer](http://boabeerblog.com/2012/02/16/leinenkugels-winter-sampler-pack/).

I am a barista, so I do make tips.  But I would rather not spend my tips, if I don't need to.  I need to pay for gas to go to pick up my boyfriend from the airport still.  haha.  But if there's something cheap that you guys suggest I pick up that I can use in many recipes, I'm up for it!

Some things I was planning on making for the weekend already:

* Pho (using the spices and some of the beef, and bones, onions, rice noodles)
* Taiwanese beef noodle soup (Using spices, beef, bones, and soba noodles) - from the two soups, I'll probably have a lot of left over beef broth.  So any recipes using beef broth would be nice too!
* Curry (beef, curry bouillon, peas, carrots, onions, potatoes)
* Roasted chicken (going to roast the whole chicken, then use the bones to make stock then use the chicken to make other things)
* Mini sandwiches (croissants, roasted chicken or tuna, cheese)
* Omelettes (egg beaters, whatever i have on hand lol veggies, chicken, steak, whatever)
* Honey citron ribs (pork ribs, honey citron concentrate as a marinade, throw it in the slow cooker... don't know how this one will work out though)
* Congee (rice, whatever meat I have leftover)

Things I was planning on freezing:
* cooking the pasta then freezing it
* cooking the rice then freezing it
* probably freezing some chicken
and... I'm stuck.  I don't really know what kinds of sauces freeze well.  Also, we'll probably be bringing the freezer dinners to my boyfriend's dorm where we only have a microwave (no stove), so freezer meals that can be rewarmed with just a microwave would be great :)

I have a slow cooker, oven, stove, microwave, blender, coffee pot (i dunno how that will help me cook, but hey some people are creative!) to cook with.  So utilizing any/all would be awesome :D

Thanks in advance for your help, guys!  I just want to make some nutritious and delicious meals, while whittling down my stock pile. &gt;&lt;"	t5_2tnbc	True

In the last years I did a radio show at my campus radio with some friends of mine: We asked people to invite us to cook for them in their homes, dorms, whatever - sometimes even on the lawn. The hosts provided a topic for the meal and we were free to cook whatever we want as long as it is connected to that topic. We tried to do unusual stuff when possible, I'm myself quite experimental at home and from that I've got some not-so-common leftovers in my cupboard. I will be moving to another town at the end of the month. So I'm trying to reduce the food I've to bring into the new flat. 

You can come up with as many suggestions as you want and surpise me with something new. This is more or less a long term task. I'm also able to buy additional stuff (meat, vegetable etc.) as long as it doesn't add up to the pile in the cupboard.


So, here we go:

- [Goji berries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfberry#Culinary)

- [Kimchi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi) (canned and some quite old self made -- not sure if still edible)

- [Gochujang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gochujang) (in fact one of my favourite ingredients I learned of by doing this radio show)

- [fufu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fufu) flour

- palm oil

- green tea soba

- fresh and dry udon

- ~~korean potato starch noodles~~

- dry soy beans

- canned chick peas

- [gram (chick pea) flour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_flour)

- miso

- oyster sauce

- ponzu sauce

- [rayu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_oil) (chinese chili oil)

- tamarind paste

- panko

- tahini

- bulghur

- canned meat (similar to spam, was the only thing we found when doing a Monty Python themed show)

- toor dal (split lentils)

- sunflower seeds

- greek kritharaki pasta (somewhat like larger rice)


And some frozen stuff as well:

- Lotus roots

- Okra

- Fresh green soy beans

- Bitter melon (this will be a challenge for you! Didn't like them at all)

- Gyoza skins

- ~~250 g ground lamb~~

I had to buy several ingredients that I don't normally use, and so I'm hoping I can get your idea on how to use up the following:

* Instant mashed potatoes.  This should be pretty easy--I can just make mashed potatoes!--but what else can I use them for?  
* whole wheat flour - no idea what to do with this.  I assume I can bake with it
* nutritional yeast flakes - ditto here
* vegan butter
* agave syrup
* tahini 
* almond milk (I can just drink this, I guess)
* soy milk (ditto)
* panko breading
* vegan burger crumbles


I have on hand:

* chicken breasts
* 1 lb ground turkey
* some polish sausage
* 1 bunch of collard greens
* frozen mixed vegetables
* frozen black-eyed peas
* diced tomatoes
* a white onion
* garlic cloves
* kidney beans
* cream cheese
* pasta (mostly rotini)
* spaghetti sauce
* any number of products for baking (baking soda, baking powder, corn starch, sugar, spices, etc.)
* condiments like mustard and catsup and soy sauce and Worcester sauce
* fats/oils (butter, olive oil, canola oil)
* guacamole
* wheat bread



I'll be going to the grocery tomorrow evening to pick up some odds and ends (eggs, fresh veggies) and would be willing to buy other ingredients if anyone has suggestions.


Thanks in advance!

I also found:

* a can of beef consomme
* some quinoa I forgot I bought

* assorted spices (usual suspects like salt, pepper, basil, dill, oregano, thyme, parsley, sage, bay leaves, garlic powder, and dried onion; but also cumin, tumeric, fennel seeds, white pepper, coriander, devil's dung)
* a can of evaporated milk
* a can of sweetened condensed milk
* all purpose flour
* sugar
* brown sugar (maybe 2/3 cup)
* balsamic vinegar
* and couple of bottles of molasses

From [my last posting](http://www.reddit.com/r/Whatsinmycupboard/comments/qbj56/i_feel_like_theres_a_meal_in_here_somewherei_just/), I also still have some fish sauce, oyster sauce, soy sauce, a small bottle of curry paste, and some sweet chile sauce. 


In my refrig I have 2% milk, minced fresh ginger, a bit of fresh cilantro, and minced garlic.

Thoughts?
