Hey all! New challenge rolling in this week, but first I would like to congratulate both /u/reyer and /u/vlaaad for winning the previous challenge! Both tied in votes, and thus both win.

***

Be sure to vote for challenge 24 [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/1fbana/vote_challenge_24_voting_thread/).

***

The current challenge is to create a mock-up mash-up. You are tasked with creating a game mock up by combining two existing franchises. An example could be Mega Man / Street Fighter, where you have Mega Man and Zero fighting it out like Ryu and Ken ,or something like that. Or, you could have a mock up like Contra / Mario where you have the contra characters jumping about in a Mario-esque world.

This is a very free form challenge, and I am hoping to see a lot of creativity come out of it! **IMPORTANT:** Absolutely no sprite-ripping or copying, these are YOUR renditions of classic characters and sprites.

***

**Rules and important info**

* Final submissions due Friday June 14th at 11:59pm EST

* Submit your art in the form of a comment to this post. Keep WIP's to one comment tree along with your final submission (see below.)

* Final submissions **must** be tagged with [Final]. It will help me quite a bit if you submit your final entry in it's own comment.

* Final submissions **must** be submitted in it's original size and **saved as .gif or .png**. (Don't scale it up!)

   * Image must be a game mock up of some sort, depicting some form of multi series crossover. (This can be art style of game X in Game Y world, or something similar.)

A month ago I finally found this subreddit, posted a thing, and you people upvoted it to, until a week ago, the very top here of all time. A bit later a fellow by the name of [Copywright](http://www.reddit.com/user/Copywright) gave me a month of Gold (thanks again, Copywright) along with-

&gt;I beseech you, please teach a University of Reddit class on pixel art v.v. For the children.

So I figured ""why not do it here?"", and if it's successful, then I'll definitely take it over to University of Reddit.

I've been doing this for a long time, worked a good few paid jobs, and I've been meaning to give back after building myself on the example of all the people that are better than me.

The only issue here is that it would rely completely on participation.

Considering the challenges have been doing well and are still growing, it *should* be possible, but I don't want to get ahead of myself without knowing the situation.

**But what exactly would it be?**

Short answer: a handful of exercises to help new artists learn and help experienced artists practice and keep up their technique.

Long answer: it depends. The ""plan"" right now would be-

-On Monday of each week, a lesson is posted, on principles of design or antialiasing techniques or whatever. If I was a student, I would read through the lesson, follow along in my image editing program, then practice what it taught and ask any questions I might have in the thread. Like any class, actually.

-Each lesson would have a related assignment, due on the Friday of the same week. They would go in a single thread, letting the professor(s) and other students see everyone's work and give feedback over the weekend.

* EDIT: Instead of two threads, they'll be submitted in the comments of the lesson. Every submission and their critiques will also go in the next lesson's OP.

-On special weeks would be exams. Larger pieces that involve some or all of what has been covered since the last exam. They would follow the same schedule as any assignment, being due on Friday and evaluated over the weekend.

-As far as grading, we can get a little gamification going on here. Each assignment that's complete and turned in by Friday will get you 10 points. On Sunday, one piece will be chosen to receive an extra 5 points (not necessarily the ""best"", since it's about learning, not quality). Exams are graded on a scale of 0-30 based on completeness. If you use all the techniques that are supposed to be in the exam, then chances are you're getting all 30. There is no way to lose points and no passing or failing, just getting back what you put in.

* EDIT: Everything here is tentative and will probably be changed. If you want to give your input then have at it.

**So why isn't it starting now?**

I can't do it alone. Well, I might have the ability to, and it could probably work, but there more help there is, the better. If either of the mods would lend their support I'll gladly take it, but as far as this thread goes-

-if you want to enroll in the first semester of UofP, then let me know here. Also I can use anyone's input on anything at all. I'm much closer to you guys than I am to Cure and Fool and all those veterans at Pixeljoint that have made a career out of their art. This is as much a learning experience for me as the class would be to you.

-if you're an experienced artist with some time on your hands and you want to help teach, then by all means let me know. But any more than maybe four would get a bit crowded.

So again, this all depends on if there's an audience for it. So tell me if there is, and we can get this going. For the children."	t5_2ql09	True

1345504424.0	yjt1p	How to read C+C	BurritoEclair	41	5	4	"A lot of people in this subreddit aren't used to having work critiqued. This is really common in art heavy environments like in schools, on real art teams, with a client and even with helpful friends. So here is how you should approach criticism.

Firstly you need to separate the constructive criticism, the useless criticism and the comments.

Comments are usually *'I like* ___ or *'I don't like* ___. Sometimes they'll say it looks like something else or it reminds them of a game's aesthetics. Most of these comments are just fluff. Comments are usually very surface level and won't really help you develop your work directly. It's nice, thank them and be courteous. If they're just being spiteful and just say that your work sucks, take a second to look at your work. Is it the worst thing you've made? Is it visually offensive? If the answer is no then ignore their comment and move on. Don't bother with trolls. Negative comments happen all the time, don't let them bog you down. You are on the internet, develop a thick skin.

Constructive criticism is great but only if you can use it to your advantage. Ask yourself if you are seriously ready to learn. Are you? Are you willing to put in the time it takes to make good work? If not, you are not only wasting your time but ours as well. Be ready to kick your own ass and get it into gear if you really want to improve. 
When you get it, pull up your work and keep referring to it as you read the criticism. If you do this you'll be able to have a critique session with yourself.

&gt;""Are the cheekbones too low? The cheekbones are too low.""

Then you can make a note of that and fix it! Brilliant you just fixed something and you piece is better for it.

As you're taking your time reading the criticism know that your work, no matter how much you love it and are proud of it, is flawed and because of that it can always get better. That's amazing, if you aren't content with you ability or your work (it's smart not to be) you can always get better. It's hard to get worse, you have to follow bad advice and not practice for a while. Getting better is still hard, but it's more 
rewarding.
If someone's explanation on how to fix your sword doesn't make sense just 
ask. If they can't properly explain it maybe someone else can. Hurray for 
reddit's format. Almost everything brought up in a criticism should be 
looked at again. Somethings you overlook. It happens.

Another thing about criticism. If you have a style, don't hide behind it. 
If there is something fundamentally wrong with your work don't ignore it and say that things are just like that because that's your style. You're getting criticism and good advice, take advantage of that. Please. If you don't understand how to make jeans look like jeans then make a legit attempt (pull up real world references first) and then show us your result. You might solve this stuff out on your own and only get a criticism that only says ""jeans need more contrast"". 

Wow, great you made decent jeans on your own, you just need to darken the darks and lighten the lights. Great job!

If you come across hateful comments try to ignore the insults and see if there is anything You can take from that. If they say that your 
character's face looks really ugly then you should stop and look at it. 

They didn't say why it's ugly. Is it supposed to be ugly? Pull up a 
reference. Is it not supposed to be ugly? Pull up a reference. Either way 
you'll benefit with a reference and probably a sketch.

Like all things worth doing, this takes a lot of work and good amount of time. You will not become amazing at it overnight. You might not even become much better overnight. But with each piece you make and the more critiques you get the better you'll be. Keep at it and be humble.

TL;DR: Read all comments and criticisms. Try to take all advice into 
consideration. Don't hide behind your ""style"". Pull up references. Have a thick skin."	t5_2ql09	True

I will look more into it though.

Before: http://i.imgur.com/C6HohZ8.png

After: http://i.imgur.com/ouLbhoU.png

- First, find out the location of your Firefox profile directory. You can do this easily by going to *Help* &gt; *Troubleshooting information* in the menu and clicking on the *Open Directory* button on the *Profile Directory* row: http://i.imgur.com/AtQyJqa.png
- From the profile directory, open the *chrome* subdirectory (or create it if it doesn't exist)
- From the chrome subdirectory, open the *userContent.css* file in your text editor of choice (or create it if it doesn't exist)
- Add the following code to the userContent.css file and save it:

        img { image-rendering: -moz-crisp-edges; }

- Restart Firefox, and you're done :)

Cheers!

*edit:* Clarified global colors. Also, just realised i might get some troubles with the backdrops, lets see. 

**update 1**

[WIP](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/100019504/8chal_tiles.png) 

I have found 4 shades where the white/black are supposed to overlap the RGB. I'm pretty much a beginner with pallettes so i'll prolly adjust it alot along the way.

**update 2**

[wip2](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/100019504/8chal_tiles2.png)

Decided to move away from the 3/4 perspective on the ground.  So far 10 tiles of 64 used. Colors are a bit useless atm. 

**update 3**

[wip3](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/100019504/challange.png)

Hey guys! Goosemonger and I have been talking about putting together a challenge for this sub reddit for a while now. Well, here it is! The rules are simple enough to follow, and you can be as creative as you want so your imagination can go pretty free on this one. Depending on the number of entries there will be either one winner or a whole podium. **Winners will receive a super cool flair for their awesome work.** Everyone else will receive a nifty participation flair for coming out and trying. 

The idea is that we will be doing one of these challenges weekly, starting at appropriately 8:00 am EST. and ending at the same time the following week. Without further ado, here is the challenge!

Challenge rules:

* Since this is the first challenge the rules will be pretty lenient, allowing for a wider group to participate.

* The deadline will be exactly one week from this post 

* Challenge winner for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd will recieve unique flairs. All other participants will get a participation flair.

Challenge:


* You have one week to create an isometric ANYTHING!

* The base of your piece MUST be placed on [this base](http://i.imgur.com/xktwV.png). As you can see it is a simple white feel free to change the colours to suit whatever you are doing. Also I have added in a iso grid to make people's lives a bit easier.

* All entries will be submitted to this thread in the comments section.

* Feel free to post your WIP in this thread! It is highly encouraged you do so! All we ask is to keep to one parent comment and reply off that with updates.

* Voting will take place the following week while the second challenge is underway. Winners will be announced the day that challenge 2 is completed.

Good luck, have fun!

Any deviation from this format will result in removal of the post, although you are free to resubmit after you fix whatever issue there is.

The format will be shown below. All text that is * italicised* is mandatory. Anything in [brackets] is personal commentary that can be replaced/not included

***

*Introduction:* 

* *Your name*

* *Company or studio name*

* *Game or project name*

* *Volunteer/paid Position and payment* [state one of the two, as well as what the salary is. **Decide how much you are willing to pay before you start to look for artists! DO NOT state that you will ""pay them with revanue from the game after release."" This screams lost cause as you will almost never get your payment as an artist.** Payment can be haggled upon in private, but a base wage is required to be posted for paid positions.]

* *Date of submission*

*Introductory paragraph describing job position as well as the game* [this can be as long or short as you like. Things to mention are amount of work hours weekly, the style of the game, the previous work done by artists, the type of work that needs to be done, and the volume of work.]
