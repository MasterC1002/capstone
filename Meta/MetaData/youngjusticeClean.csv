1359954652.0	17unhq	I'm writing a letter to Cartoon Network to try and show physical evidence that there are a lot of people that enjoy the show. What do you guys think?	shadowfreddy	91	9	38	"I figure an old fashioned snail mail letter is going to be better received than an infinite number of comments on the internet from nameless people. Tying a physical person to a name and an honest letter will probably do better than 500 random comments. So I decided to write a letter.

I did some digging and found their offices in California. The address is:  
Cartoon Network Studios  
300 N 3rd St.  
Burbank, CA 91502   

After writing the whole thing I realized I didn't know who to actually send it to to read it. Took me a long time but I found out Jay Bastian is a production manager in charge of a bunch of shows, including Young Justice. He seems like the right guy. 

[Here's the letter I intend to send him.](http://i.imgur.com/QtwPbHT.png)
So what do you guys think? I wanted to be as nice and courteous as I could. I wanted to make sure I didn't just dismiss the shows they plan to replace the current block with. And I wanted to sound hopeful and almost desperate even. I figure it would sound more dire when he read it. Most importantly I wanted to show how much I (hell all of us) like the shows and gush over it with out sounding too much like a big fanboy."	t5_2t3l1	True

1363617628.0	1aixmn	So, you want to help save the show, huh?	Wepolls	87	13	28	"You're trying to get a Kickstarter going to save Young Justice, and someone made a poll to gauge interest. [Link to poll](http://www.wepolls.com/p/15669972/Would-you-donate-money-to-see-a-3rd-season-or-movie-of-Young-Justice)

Someone from here emailed Wepolls and asked for any help we could give. We're fans of the show and we think using a poll is a great way to show interest in a Kickstarter. It's also not the first time people have used Wepolls in this way before. 

We're going to send your poll out in an email blast. We've tweeted it out to DC, Cartoon Network, and the show's producers, and some fans. It's on our Facebook and our Google+. 

We'll need more votes than there are members here. I'd go for 10,000.  Start with social media. Facebook, Twitter, Google+. Tweet it to big players. Retweet ours since they're already going to the big players. On Facebook post it to groups. Comic groups, video game groups, and on walls. On Google+ join communities and post it there. 

If you're posting the poll, post an image with it. Do like a quickmeme that says ""Save Young Justice / Vote in this poll"" and then link the poll with the image post. (Images on Facebook and Twitter are more likely to end up in a stream.)

What about Reddit?  Are there other subreddits were people wouldn't see voting in the Save YJ poll to be spam? If there are subs that would be sympathetic, post the poll there too. Submit the poll to StumbleUpon. 

It doesn't end there. Someone is going to need to step up and build a professional looking Save Young Justice website to organize from and plan email and social media bombs. You guys also need to figure our the names, email addresses, and real addresses of who to target. Execs and the like. 

Someone who's good at graphics should make wanted posters for Kid Flash, Aqualad, Darksied, Superboy, et cetera, to spread around the internet. Reddit, Pinterest, Imgur, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter. 

Most important thing right now is that someone build a website and go buy SaveYoungJustice.com for $10 because it's available right now. http://www.godaddy.com/domains/searchresults.aspx?ci=54814

Back in the day I was part of the Save Farscape campaign. We didn't get a 5th season, but we got a mini series to wrap it up. For Young Justice even a move that ties it together would be a great win. That was before Kickstarter and Facebook and Twitter too! 

Wepolls isn't that big of a social network. But like I said, we're fans, and so are our kids. We'll help in anyway. Here's some advice.

Divide your skills:

* writers 
* marketers 
* graphic designers 
* web developers 
* photographers 
* whatever else you need 

Be organized and win. "	t5_2t3l1	True

Because I'm not officially involved with the Young Justice show or the comic or WB or Cartoon Network or DC. But I know people who are. And I've talked with them about this. At length. 

SMGO. **Not going to happen**. Sorry. We'd all like to chase the dream, but this is reality. No. The 2 guys running it do **NOT** know anything about the animation industry, do **NOT** have the blessing of WB (and have been explicitly told by WB that they can not crowd fund more Young Justice.) The most they're going to get out of this is a law suit. 

Objectively SMGO has probably done more to damage the Young Justice brand than it has helped it, both in the eyes of WB and in the public sphere, because people are focusing on it &amp; spending money on it instead of real options. 

So, again, I'm sorry. It sucks. I want Young Justice back just as much as anybody. I really, really do. But **SMGO is not the answer**. It never will be the answer. That's just not how these things work.

For background info, I work at a Greek Restaurant that is a favorite of old married couples. I had a man around 55 come in last night with his wife and when I asked him his name for the order, he replied with 'Kal-el'. I immediately got excited because I don't know a single person in real life who likes superheros/comic books/etc.

 Hoping for the best, I asked if he knew what Young Justice or Green Lantern: The animated series was. Not only did he know, he was a HUGE fan of the show and had been following DC and Marvel comics since the 60's!! We got to talk about our favorite characters,hopes for the rest of the season, and how Aqualad was a total beefcake - I couldn't have been happier connecting with a fellow fan and I really began to understand just HOW GOOD the shows were that they appealed to people of all ages and socioeconomic backgrounds.

So, I guess what I'm saying is the communites around these shows rock and I really, really, really hope that CN sees  what a huge mistake canceling them would be. Thanks for reading!"	t5_2t3l1	True

SEASON ONE of YOUNG JUSTICE has all aired multiple times by now.

SEASON TWO/YOUNG JUSTICE INVASION

* Episodes 201-207 have already aired. 207 airs again this weekend, and then new episodes begin airing on Saturday morning September 29th as part of Cartoon Network's DC Nation block.  

* Episodes 208-218 are all in the can. Finished. Done. Ready to air.

* Episode 219 is back here in Burbank, and we'll be calling retakes and locking picture this week. 

* Episode 220 is due in from Moi late this week. That's right; we're really in the homestretch on Season Two now.


YOUNG JUSTICE COMPANION COMIC BOOK 

* Issues #0-19 have all hit the stands and are available at comic shops or online.

* Issue #20 hits the stands this week. It's the start of a six-part story that is BIG. REALLY BIG. It updates the book, bringing in our Season Two cast, and is set one month prior to the start of Season Two with flashbacks to a couple untold - or only hinted at - tales from the Season One era, plus, by the end of the six-parter, a little story from immediately after Season One. Christopher Jones is just doing some stellar work on the book. And I'm pretty proud of the story and script, if I do say so myself.

* Issue #21 is being colored by Zac Atkinson as we speak.

* Issue #22 is being pencilled by Chris.

* Issues #23 &amp; #24 are both fully scripted and waiting.

* Issue #25 is plotted. I'll be starting on the script tonight.
As always, you don't have to read the comic to enjoy the t.v. series or vice versa. But you get more out of BOTH if you watch/read both.


THE VIDEO GAME
Young Justice Legacy seems to be proceeding apace. I've done a bit of polishing on some of the dialogue to make sure it's consistent with the show.

Will open again for reader postings on September 29th. Please follow all guidelines - and please, please, please DON'T FLOOD the queue. But please do post your responses to the comics that came out this summer when posting was not possible.

This is was I came up with. We get adult swim and toonami to pick up Young Justice.  

The problem with the show is that it doesn't have the ratings and ad revenue to warrant its slot on saturday mornings. Adult Swim while they too need ratings and ad revenue, the expectations for late night are much lower than for sat am. sat am is prime time for the kids shows. 

So we take Young justice a moderately grown up, slightly gritty show and put it on toonami. No its not anime, but neither is the thundercats. I feel young justice can find a good home on toonami. 

So how do we do this? We need to mobilize! Any and all YJ fans you can find. Get on twitter, Get on facebook, get on anything else you can and bombard Cartoon Network, Toonami, and Adult Swim request pleading begging demanding young justice on adult swim: Toonami. 

Also use these links.

Recently I have been brainstorming. So what if we buy all the toys off the Mattel site? And most of us probably can't justify spending money on toys either.

So I started to think a bit bigger: Could we essentially run a toy drive  where we buy Young Justice toys for kids in hospitals, orphanages, and other places like that. If they run out of Young Justice toys we move on to other DC/CN properties.

It's a different sort of *Young Justice* and if big enough could garner some media attention:&gt; Fans of Canceled Television Show Give to Charity to Show Support .
 It's also a different approach taken to saving a show which, to my knowledge, hasn't been tried yet. 

The way I see it we would need:

* To gather the Facebook, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter and other Young Justice AND Green Lantern fan bases.
* Get in contact with a secure charity organization.
* Once in place get in contact with media. 

Anyone with knowledge on those things should speak up now.


Finally: I know it might be considered a shitty means to an end. We are only donating to get our show known about and it might also make sense to keep efforts coupled with informing about children in need.

This is only a very rough draft. More focus would be needed but I wanted your thoughts and input. 

Why not save our show and make some kids happy along the way. "	t5_2t3l1	True
1359444539.0	17hhtb	Let's have us a Twitter campaign: #JusticeIsOurs	RagamuffinGunner13	50	2	18	"---

**Introduction**

I've been suggesting this in the comment sections for a while now, but I've finally decided to take the initiative myself.

It all started with Fringe. The severely underrated show was in dire ratings territory during its final seasons, leading some of its viewers to seek a solution as bold and innovative as the show itself. Using an original hashtag each week, they managed to trend Worldwide and in the U.S. every week the show aired. 

Why a new hashtag every week? Because Twitter's trending algorithms determine top trends by what is being talked about *right now* more than previously. Since we've used #SaveYoungJustice before, it will be harder to get to the top of the trends list. The Fringenuity movement used this information, and...

It caught the attention of Fox, which even went so far as to display the hashtags onscreen during the episodes. Fringe managed to get a fifth season and a decent ending, and I believe the Twitter campaigns were a large part of that. Can we make Cartoon Network take notice in a similar way? It's worth a try.

---

**#JusticeIsOurs**

I'm open to debate as to what hashtags we should use, but I like this one to begin with. It sends a clear message: *This is our show.*

I want to test this strategy immediately, with the new episode airing this **Saturday, February 2nd.**

We will all begin tweeting simultaneously at **9:30 A.M. Eastern Time,** one hour before the new episode airs, and we'll keep tweeting throughout the episode.

---

**GUIDELINES**

1) **Don’t use #JusticeIsOurs before the designated time: 9:30 AM EST, 1 HOUR before Young Justice airs.**


2) **One # term per Tweet. Use only #JusticeIsOurs**

3) Lots of people tweeting matters more than the number of tweets.

Spread the word to all Young Justice fans. There is strength in numbers – remember that the more unique tweeters we have, the more likely we are to trend, and for a longer duration of time. Send your tweets out steadily – remember to pace yourself. You want to avoid “Twitter Jail.” Sustained tweeting over time matters.

4) Those with lots of followers help out a lot!

Let's see if we can get the show creators in on this

5) We want to pique the interest of non-YJ fans.

This is the key to our trending duration success. It gives a chance to get our message about YJ out to another audience. Try to construct a list of thoughtful and informative tweets before the event. These can be copied and pasted for easy tweets. Use some Young Justice quotes – link some of the official promo videos – speculate about the show.

6) We can discuss aspects of the show in our tweets.

TRY to include the title ""Young Justice"" (with no #) in your tweet if possible. Talk about the characters and the actors.

7) **Private accounts must have their locked status removed, as the tweets from locked accounts do not count toward the trend tally.**

8) **Retweets are the easiest way to help out the trending effort.**

Just search for the hashtag, and retweet the ones that are interesting to you.

---

Whew. Everyone still with me? Trust me, it's not as complicated as it all sounds. We may not get that many people tweeting for this first one, but hopefully this will all snowball into something bigger.

However this turns out, it's important that we stay unified and keep fighting the good fight. And if necessary, go down swinging!

First, that Aqualad (who, once and for all, is not a triple agent) is not going to be on active duty for quite a while if ever.  Secondly, that the partner of the Light is not Darkseid, but rather the Reach, something I must admit got me by surprise (seeing that G. Gordon. Godfrey is their agent rather than Darkseid's is kinda strange, but I suppose this isn't the comics and names are flexible).

Ok, down to the plot.  Blue Beetle is still in a containment pod, being experimented on by two ""scientists"" of the Reach, who reveal that since Jaime Reyes isn't going to co-operate, they'll have to ""reboot"" the scarab by putting it onto a new host.  Black Beetle is also there and whole-heartedly agrees that this is the right thing to do.

The Team isn't helpless through all of this, however.  They let Tim Drake, Barbra Gordon, and Bumblebee get captured, and follow them to the ship holding Impulse, Beast Boy, Blue, and a number of teenage civilians hostage, and start freeing them.  

However, there's a problem.  Aqualad and the Black Beetle stand in the way.  While Aqualad is taken down by Miss Martian, Black Beetle is much stronger than L'Gaan, Superboy, and Miss Martian put together, and even Blue at full strength can't do anything other than fight him evenly.  They eventually tear a hole in the ship, allowing the team and the civilians to escape to the surface.

However, they're too late.  The Reach shows up at the United Nations before the world can be warned of their threat, and they also have a huge armada of ships at the bottom of the Mariana Trench that nobody, not even the team, seems to know about.

One question seems to be natural after watching this episode: why would the Light want to partner with these aliens?  They all seem to be playing for the Earth Home Team, and I'll wager that Vandal regretted all that talk about the glory of human evolution when he saw the future that Impulse lived through.  We know whatever it is doesn't work, but what exactly is the Light's plan here?

Seeing that Blue Beetle is the evil Impulse was sent back in time to prevent puts a whole new spin on knowing that Impulse failed to save the future, but seeing that Jaime can give full control of armor and weapons to the scarab and that the scarab still won't betray humanity gives some hope.

In my view:

* Best moment of the episode - one of Aqualad's ""soldiers"" suddenly beating up Tigress and several other mooks before revealing himself to be Superboy in disguise.
* Saddest moment of the episode: Miss Martian looking through Aqualad's brain and seeing, too late, that they were all on the same side the whole time.

---

Remember in the season one finale when Vandal Savage and Clarion the Witch Boy took total control of the Justice League and the Watchtower? **NO, because they didn’t!** That wasn't the point.

Those geniuses spent a whole season trying to take over the Justice League and in a single episode they lose? After all the tricks they pulled in other episodes, their control over the most powerful beings on Earth is lost in a single battle? That mind control stuff was a red herring. They never wanted actual control over the JL.

**The whole point of Vandal Savage’s plan was to get those six members off-world for 16 hours.** (Batman, Hawkwoman, John Stewart, Martian Manhunter, Superman, and Wonder Woman) The faces of the Justice League, the most powerful members, are criminals because of those 16 hours and are removed from Earth in season 2. Savage’s goal was to get the Justice League off Earth for season 2.

Look at the members of The Light, what they bring to the table, and a bigger pictures unfolds. They have…an immortal, the most powerful industrialist on the planet, the strongest evil sorcerer, the genius brain, the woman who can control world leaders and the dark king of the ocean. When working together, they have the perfect skill set to take over the world. But they are all “the bad guys”, and are known for not getting along since they all want to be in charge. **The odds of The Light gathering together willing on their own are beyond slim.** These people didn’t make The Light, they were recruited into it. Like a game of chess, each member has something *He* wants.

And in season 2, with the Justice League’s most powerful members off world, The Light has a foothold on Earth. They are slowly getting stronger, an army building.

Two alien races are causing a power struggle between themselves, the Justice League and the unwitting humans.

The Reach is developing a juice that can enslave mankind, making them passively obedient.

The Reach is trying to isolate the Meta-gene to weaponize it.

**Who would benefit most from all this chaos?** In whose best interest would it be to get Superman off Earth? Who would get something from the enslavement of mankind but not benefit from killing them off and who would have a need for a Meta-human army?

They call themselves The Light, as in people who realize the truth. That the world needs to have their superheroes removed, that the powerful should in charge, that chaos makes sense. They see the Light at the end of the Boom Tube and they know who is in charge, who can use their skills and make them Gods.

1362812110.0	19ymbn	OFFICIAL MOD POST: WE HAVE A VERY SPECIAL TREAT FOR THE COMMUNITY! JOIN US AT 5PM EST ON SUNDAY MARCH 10th FOR AN AMA WITH CHRISTOPHER JONES AND ZAC ATKINSON (individuals who worked on the amazing Young Justice Comic). Come and ask them about their previous and current works, processes, and whatnot!	Shiniholum	43	8	8	"Hello ladies and gentlemen! We at /r/YoungJustice have a special treat for you guys! Tomorrow (March 10, 2013, 10-3-2013, 3-10-2013, 2013-10-3) We will be having an AMA (Ask me Anything) with Christopher Jones, who provided pencils and inks for DC's Young Justice tie-in comic book, and Zac Atkinson, who provided all of the color art on the Young Justice comic book!

----

From Christopher Jones’ website, http://www.ChristopherJonesArt.com - in addition to Young Justice, he has also worked on DC's The Batman Strikes!, Young Heroes in Love, Marvel's Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, Dr. Blink: Superhero Shrink and more! And Zac Atkinson, http://www.evilby.me - in addition to Young Justice, has worked on Transformers, Farscape, Irredeemable and more!

----

So please join us Sunday March 10th at 5pm EST/4pm CST for an AMA with these two talented and comic book artists! What follows is some stuff you should keep in mind, etiquette, and the AMA functionality.
----

First: Etiquette!

**PLEASE, PLEASE PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THESE KIND AWESOME INDIVIDUALS HAVE NO BEARING ON THE DIRECTION OR INNER WORKINGS OF THE TV SHOW!**


They do art for the comic and therefore have no input on the sudden issues we are having with the tv show. 


Please also keep in mind that they are doing **US** a favor by doing this AMA, they could easily not do it but instead they are and so please for the love of all things good and holy in the world, be courteous, we want them to feel welcome and not put off by our community (think more of /r/community ama’s and less rampart). 

----

Second: How this will work


Chris’s Reddit Handle: ChristopherJonesArt


Zac’s Reddit Handle: ZacAtkinson


----

Since we have 2 people for 1 AMA we will have Chris post it and both he and Zac will answer within as two separate users. 




Within the post when you write your question or comment format it in this way: 


@Chris:


Blah blah ART AND STUFF!


@Zac:


Blah blah Did you watch transformers as a kid?


And they will try to respond.


Also inorder to further establish that they are answering pay attention to their custom text flair

Someone also wanted me to save it as PDF so others can go and send in their own letters. I was hestiant about this because sending a ton of carbon copy letters may not have the same impact as a bunch of individual letters, but I thought ""fuck it!"", these are still physical letters from people with unique names and addresses. There's still value there. 

So [here's the PDF](https://mega.co.nz/#!sgxUHCpJ!VTXhglGl2V6hsMF-Xk5x4R5Rtbh73hJE8nQYvFdT19U). I think you might need an MEGA account to get it, but I'm not sure. It's free regardless. If you can't get into it tell me somewhere else to upload it and I will. I would still *HIGHLY PREFER* that if anyone does download it to send it in themselves, that they **PERSONALIZE IT and MAKE IT THEIR OWN**. Unique letters are better than a bunch of the same ones. If they're all the same it feels like spam, not fan mail.

SMOG has a meeting with the WB executives to get YJ and GL:TAS back, but we can't just give up now without a fight. It's like if Robin, KF, and Aqualad just gave up on their independence in the first episode and just let Cadmiss burn to the ground with Superboy in it. We won't come back this year. But if we keep acting so negative we won't even get to come back at all! Either get on board or get out of the way.	t5_2t3l1	True

No one's used the word cancelled.

"	wisesonAC	39	11	53	"lets get this out of the way(please up vote, its a self post i recieve no karma and it would be nice for everyone to see) 

wassup guys and of course gals its your friendly neighborhood wisesonAC bringing your a little some some you know that spark(i hope) in any case this is the ""young justice 30 day challenge"" something interesting i found people were doing with other things shows etc. i think the original comes from tumblr. but i digress. 

the basics-its a thing that happens over the course of thirty days.you answer one question per day. i figure it would be fun and get everyone involved.today(night) is day 1 for me.(i figure everyone can do theirs in the comments and update daily(miss a day no worries just make up for lost time).) also be as detailed as you want. :-) no worries. i also thought it would be a fun for everyone to compare notes and keep discussion fresh(somewhat)

Day 1. How you found out about Young Justice?-i found out by promos hear say and me basically googleing(spelling?) all the info i could. the show sounded amazing on paper. and it looked beautiful too.

Day 2. thoughts on the season 2.5 trailer recently released.- man it was epic! Static, deathstroke and so many other themes that will take a toll on the characters. It is set up to be amazing.... Ima go watch it again. 

Day 3. Favorite villain and why?-honestly ill go with black manta. he seems like he is gonna play a bigger role in coming episodes. he is intelligent,has an army at his disposal,aqualads dad,and he just joined the light. he will be a force to be reckoned with.

Day 4. Least favorite villain and why?- i never really cared for ultra-humanite,just seemed so bland and never really stuck out.plus with gorillia grodd kinda idk redundant. (correct me if im wrong) 

Day 5. Favorite male character and why?- that would have to be Aqualad for a few simple reasons, he is humble,loyal(to the extent of taken one for the team and going undercover), a good leader, very perceptive, has unique and useful weapons and is just an all around bad ass. 

Day 6. Favorite female character and why?-rocket;for many reasons explained [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/youngjustice/comments/tiyk0/my_fellow_redditors_gather_around_boys_and_girls/)

Day 7. Least favorite character and why?-lagoon boy. honestly seemed like an asshole. not the lovable woleverine asshole the annoying water based bad catchphrase having  asshole.

Day 8. Best mentor and why?(EX. Aquaman, Superman, Batman, Martian Manhunter,Icon etc.) favorite mentor icon but best would have to be well batman. he atleast somewhat respects the teams space.hes not overbearing he  lets them figure things out on their own.which is sometimes what  kids need. plus he's fucking batman.

Day 9. Worst mentor and why?(EX. Aquaman, Superman, Batman (LOLOLBATMAN), Martian Manhunter Icon etc.) none are bad perse just not as good as others. i vote for aquaman. nothing person just wish he would have been honest with aqualad.but overall i guess he's a pretty good mentor.

Day 10. Best friendship and why? gotta god with the friendship between wally and dick.they seem to know alot about each others past, act like best friends,have secrets,and just seem to have real good chemistry. all that equals to a great friendship.

Day 11. Superpower/skill you’d want and why? i would to have a powerset like [Idie Okonkwo aka Oya](http://worldofblackheroes.com/2010/10/06/idie-okonkwo-oya/) Idie is a high level thermo-kinetic mutant able to generate both heat and cold from her body. Not only can she generate Ice and fire but also control their shape and intensity she is also immune to temperature extremes. that just screames bad ass. look [here](http://worldofblackheroes.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/oya7.jpg), [here](http://worldofblackheroes.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/oya6.jpg), [here](http://worldofblackheroes.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/oya1.jpg).

Day 12. Favorite ship and why? id have to  say wally and artemis. it was just a long time coming. through out season 1 they really teased it and it warmed up to me. plus i think artemis will straighten wally out.

Day 13. Least favorite ship and why? lagoon boy and megan. honestly lagoon boy is a douche.

Day 14. Favorite from the Justice League team and why? icon.he's black, super intelligent,a ace lawyer, alien who crash landed in the southern usa circa 1839 and lived thtough slavery harlem Renaissance great depression and so many other historical events. and he can go toe to toe with superman need i say more?

Day 15. Least favorite from the Justice League team and why? hmm honestly i didnt really dislike anyone.

Day 16. Robin or Aqualad as leader and why? aqualad because even though he wasnt groomed to be leader since age 9(robin) he is very capable of making sure the mission gets done.

Day 17. Favorite quote ""youre overwhelmed freeze was underwhelmed what isnt anyone just whelmed?"" -robin

Day 18. Favorite Superboy/Miss Martian moment-when superboy accepted her appearance even though she was really scared of the reaction. i found it really touching.

Day 19. Funniest moment-i remember when Artemis made some jokes about alomst drowing like twice that was pretty funny.

Day 20. A mentor and protege you’d want to spend the day with and why?robin and batman. because hes fuckin batman. and just spending time with them would teach alot to anybody.

Day 21. Favourite “Red” tornado hands down. but firebrand was pretty cool.

Day 22. Favorite episode and why? the episode where all the adults disappear. great episode that took place on my birthday! nov 5th.

Day 23. Favorite mentor/protoge relationship and why?i really like batman and robins relationship. its really unique. bruce cheered robin up by playing basketball with him. among other things. its just really really cool.

Day 24. Thoughts on episode 207 ""Depths"" its a great set-up for whats to come.and i love the twist at the end.

Day 25. Who you want to see more of on the show. rocket hands down!

Day 26. Explain your thoughts about the show in general-i feel its  a very diverse and unique show that shows great stories, underused characters get a chance to shine,the art is amazing, its funny and just all around amazing. something tv needs.

Day 27. Are you a villain or a superhero and why. probably a villain. because powers corrupt everybody. and im only human. plus i could chill all day no need to rush out at all hours of the day like heroes. ill be sensible lol

Day 28. Any character you’d want to be- mos def Aqualad. the triple C Kal'dur who leads the team, makes a selfless sacrifice to join his dad for the greater good and who has a really cool weapon...yeah deffiently(sp?)  him.  

Day 29. Any changes you’d make to the show-

* make it an hour long. this way we can have more character developent,wont have great characters being useless for no reason, more time to develop  the overall universe maybe take the time to really make the animation unique and distinctive.(even though it looks great).


* honestly i  cant really think of anything else. well maybe more milestone.thats just me.

Day 30. Who you’d add to the show-wow man i could write a moutain about this. i'd only add characters if they actually get used to their potential that being said [heres](http://www.reddit.com/r/youngjustice/comments/ugqmd/if_you_could_add_one_member_to_the_team_who_would/) my answer."	t5_2t3l1	True
1339701526.0	v24dp	Update From Greg	Cairodin	31	2	6	"Greg just gave us a new update over [here](http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/rambles.php).

Looks like they only had 3 episodes left before they ran out of episodes that were ready to be aired.  I'm guessing they didn't provide as good a stopping point as Depths did (which, honestly, was a really nifty place to leave off for a bit).

He also notes that he doesn't know when they'll be back from hiatus, which conflicts with the YJ facebook page saying it's September 29th.  Hopefully he's just uninformed, and we really do have a firm date for the end of the break.

The last thing of note is the comics.  Apparently an Arrow-Family story had to be put on the back-burner in order to bring the comic up to speed with the show.  I understand the decision, but I do love Artemis and hope to have more of her stories.  Then again, the story that he plans to do starting with issue 20 may give us a lot of answers about things that happened during the 5 year gap.  I'm pretty excited about it.

Anyway, I didn't see this posted anywhere and I thought I'd share."	t5_2t3l1	True

House of Cards is prime example of this. 

Also generating buzz is Netflix reviving old, popular, fan-favorite shows that were ""cancelled before their time."" ['Arrested Development' has been picked up by Netflix after seven years](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/23/arrested-development-spring-netflix_n_1824588.html) for a ten-episode fourth season (although one cast member states that the number could potentially expand to 13). 

Additionally, there is word that Netflix may, in fact, be in talks to [revive the post-apocalyptic drama series Jericho](http://screencrush.com/jericho-revival-netflix/) after nearly 5 years of cancellation. 

With Netlix and Young Justice Production Company, Time Warner/Warner Brothers, [recent licensing agreement for streaming content from the broadcasting group's past content](http://www.dailyfinance.com/2013/01/15/netflix-signs-deal-with-warner-brothers-turner-bro/) aired on Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, and Warner Brothers Animation, would it be too far-fetched at some point to see the series live on through the monthly rental and streaming  service? 

Judging from what we've seen and known about 'House of Cards' and 'Arrested Development,' it would be safe to say that if, in this fantasy scenario, that Young Justice did return on Netflix; it would return with roughly a dozen episodes, all released simultaneously. 

So Young Justice fans, would you be interested in seeing your beloved series live on if it meant going through Netflix for a considerably shorter season and every installment would be released concurrently?"	t5_2t3l1	True

/r/YoungJustice Community Comics!"	Shiniholum	45	18	70	"The beginning and the end, alpha and omega, like everything else in life all good stories have a beginning and an end. Sometimes stories and worlds die all too soon (Firefly) and other times they hang on by a single tread slowly and painfully writhing into its own death (The Office). And even though Cartoon Network, DC, and Time Warner have all decided to abandon Young Justice there is no reason why we should at all. The simple fact of the matter is no matter what happens, no matter if this little project of ours doesn’t take off the simple and undeniable truth of the matter is that we have something special because of this show, I’ve seen this small community blossom into a really wonderful, diverse and obscenely talented community; and no matter what happens I am thankful for my time with the show and with you all. We all are. But another undeniable truth is that I am not done and I won’t give up. So I had an idea, a little spit ball of an idea, I was churning it in my head for weeks before I finally brought it up to my other mods and we started talking about how we would go about it and so here it is.


We are going to be writing our own comic, a community comic, based on the wonderful show and comic that we have had the pleasure of seeing. Crazy right?

So now what is this? What does all of this mean?

Simple. We can tell any story we want. We can use any character we want. We can do whatever we want. But we need the community to participate in order for this to work.
Now this isn’t a contest. There is no singular winner, since we all win.  

Here is the basic format of how this works:

&gt;Week 1: Story

&gt;Week 2: Art (by the community for the story from Week 1)

&gt;Week 3: Story part 2

&gt;Week 4: Art (by the community for the story from Week 3)

&gt;Rinse and repeat until the story is finished. 

We will decide on an arc and start writing for it.

At the start of an arc we (the mods) will post a short paragraph introducing the story that we will write about, an example of an introduction we would post would be “Batman walks into a bar…”, then we will end with “and then batman went to bed at the end of day 1.” We are also collaborating with user /u/GoldandBlue to provide custom artwork for characters so you know what to base the story and the art around! (some form of consistency between the individual fan art).

Next is where you guys come in.  Your job for week one is to fill in what happens in between those two events.

We will then compose the story you decided on and wrote and post the final product of week 1 on the following week for people to draw art for.

Now I know that may seem daunting but I want to assure you guys that I am not asking you all to write a full story by yourselves or draw an entire page by yourselves. For the story all you have to do is contribute “Oh he should drop down from the rafters here,” or “Nightwing should pop out of the shadows here.” And for the art the same rules that applied to fan-art Friday apply here: **THERE IS NO BAD ART** you can draw a single panel of stick figures and I will still use it. It literally does not matter as long as people contribute.

Any work, any story written, any art drawn should be posted as a comment in the Weekly Week 1 of Blank-Story thread that we will have up the same time as the discussion posts (for easy accessibility).
 
Now I know this sounds like fan-fiction but the thing about fan-fiction is that is very hit and miss. Not a lot of people will enjoy fan-fiction while others do. Unfortunately I am in the former of that group; I personally can’t bring myself to read any fan-fiction. So I don’t want this to turn into a fan-fiction like project. I don’t want users to write huge blocks of text, I don’t want users to write stories on their own, I want this to be something that you guys will collaborate on. 
 
So this week we since we have this announcement and the final episode of this season debuting we will start this bright and early next Saturday! And just a little teaser for you guys, the first story we will be telling is…

2) Brandon Vietti, the other executive producer on Young Justice besides Greg, refused to reveal any ideas on season 3 that Greg and him have in case the opportunity for more Young Justice arises in the future.

3) The video games is coming out in September. If YJ was truly over, they would cancel the game as well.

4) The DVDs are still selling strong. The soundtrack releasing soon is also on track sell well according to preorders.

5) This is just me speculating, but WB knows how beloved the series is. If Beware the Batman fails terribly, they know Young Justice can be a fallback. Also, even if Beware the Batman doesn't fail, a series as popular as Young Justice can't be gone forever, right? It just wouldn't make sense.

We need to band together in this final stand for The Team. No ideas are stupid. Anything we can do to convince those executives that Young Justice and Green Lantern, we need to do before that meeting. Anything at all to grab their attention will be worth it. But if that meeting goes sour, we are all done. 

Now we don't know if all those tweets we sent out worked. We need to refine our campaigning. We only have a handful of people to get attention.

Then the fall comes through. Every episode is now on an incredible new service. It allows you to stream online, for free. It had adds, to make up for it. 

The service is called ""Canned"". Every major network has given up rights to canned shows for the past 6 mouths. Canned has been recruiting more and more producers, actors, anything. The budget is huge. The networks wanted to see how it panned out, so they invested. If they give up rights to a show, they get 50% of all proceeds to it.

Shows that you have always loved come back. YJ, GL, Firefly, anything.

Buy the dvd's

Send them mail. CONSTANTLY.

If anything can be learned from the Mass Effect Debacle last year we just need to make loud enough noise and hopefully someone will listen. 

Lets bombard them with cupcakes! 

Constantly tweet and post to them.

The show has ridiculous ratings we need to make them see that ""not canceling it"" and ""letting it run its course"" are two things that no one should say about the show. 

Lets not forget our brothers at /r/greenlanternanimated or /r/lanterncorps

Lets bring our issues to /r/comicbooks because dont forget that our comic is also being canceled.

    In fearful day, in raging night,
    With strong hearts full, our souls ignite,
    When all seems lost in the War of Light,
    Look to the stars - for hope burns bright!

We can not give up hope. Not yet. "	t5_2t3l1	True

I am practicing making gifs and would like to create some YJ ones at your requests.

Let me know what episode, roughly what time, and what exactly you want a gif of. I will work on making the highest upvoted ones later this week.

Edit: Awesome ideas. I know I have seen a few of these gifs on tumblr (Don't hate there is a solid YJ fandom on there.) so I will see if I can locate those quick. 

EDIT 2: I am just locating GIFS all willy nilly right now I will links soon. Again- I won't be making any today/tomorrow but I will do what I can to find ones you have requested.

1367627132.0	1dni4e	Guys, now isn't the time to grief, it's the time to fight!	offdachain	33	9	7	"Just because SMGO failed, doesn't mean we are out. We were just denied the ability to raise throw money at WB to bring our show back. 

Forget my last post, we aren't done here! We have tons we still can do! No one in their right mind (even though from recent events the WB executives don't seem in their right mind...) would just throw away all of Earth 16. Movies, comics, even a new series can bring back our beloved characters. 

I understand if you are getting through the stages of grief, and accept the fact that YJ is gone now, BUT YOU SHOULDN'T GREIVE SOMETHING THAT ISN'T GONE! 

We have a couple routes to go at the moment that we can campaign for. We can pitch WB ideas for new series taking place on our beloved Earth 16. Justice League, The Outlaws, anything really. Not even pitch necessarily, but get someone's creative juices flowing. Then, hopefully, we get a great dark gritty show in 2014 that can have a good toy line (I know... The whole toy line thing... But it's really the only way to keep the show going) 

We can contact their animated movie division to get at least one movie to tie up Darksied. To me, this seems the easiest to do. If we can convince someone with the rights to animated DC to produce it, it would give us all some closure. And all the DC animated movies being produced right now aren't really aimed towards kids. They are aimed at almost the same audience that watched Young Justice.

We can try to revive the companion comic. This to me is the least realistic thing we can do, but still might work. 

We can also cross our fingers and hope for a place in the 2014 lineup. This is what I want the most. Contrary to popular belief, WB only said no to raising money for them. They never officially canceled it, and they can produce another season at any time. Ever. 

Finally, you can stayed subbed and watch how our community comic turns out. Seriously. From what we have now, it is doing awesome! The only reason we haven't seen an update for a while is because our mod (who has done a great job) is really busy right now. It will go on. Trust me.

This small defeat isn't the end of our fight, it is just the beginning. "	t5_2t3l1	True

What do you think?

How this is gonna work is I'm going to tell you guy's a little bit more about these characters and hopefully you guys will get a better understanding of who they really are. ok now without further adieu.( if i spelled that right) lets get the show started.

**INFO**    **ROCKET**                 
firstly, i think i should start with a personal favorite of mine Rocket. Rocket was an original character of the milestone comics line that ran in the 90s starting in 93'.(AKA the Dakotaverse) she stared in her shared tittle with icon. their comic was named ""icon and rocket."" her real name is Raquel Ervin she was was born in [Paris island](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Paris_Island), the poorest, most crime-ridden neighborhood in [Dakota](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Dakota_City). rocket is such a believable character for many reasons. firstly, because She yearned to become a writer (""just like Toni Morrison""), but lacked the motivation. That is, until she met Augustus Freeman IV AKA Icon, a alien that has been stranded on earth since 1839. also rocket was comics first teenage mother superhero! it addressed an issue that was prevalent in America and still is. you see Shortly after she began adventuring with Icon, Raquel discovered that she was pregnant by her ex-boyfriend.She decided to keep the baby. She gave birth to a son, whom she named Amistad Augustus Ervin. ""Amistad"" was in honor of the famous ship that brought slaves over from Africa to America, and ""Augustus"" after Icon's human alias.also her pregnancy caused her to give up being a super hero for a time.she eventually took the mantle again.also, Rocket was very liberal in her beliefs as opposed to the conservative Icon that led to them butting head on numerous occasions. those are just a few aspects of her character.

**POWERS**
but now time to wrap it up and tell about her powers and do a compare and contrast of her then and now. rockets powers all derive from her [inertia belt](http://www.comicvine.com/rocket/29-16695/all-images/108-206108/rocket/105-1091438/).When activated, the inertia winder(which is located in her belt buckle) surrounds Rocket in an ""inertia field,"" which absorbs and stores any kinetic energy used against it. which allows her to redirect it and use it as she wants weather it be kinetic beams of energy or kinetic punches.                       
**COMPARISON**                                                                                    
here's the [old rocket](http://www.comicvine.com/rocket/29-16695/all-images/108-206108/rocket1/105-1091439/)vs [new rocket](http://www.comicvine.com/rocket/29-16695/all-images/108-206108/d0d96bf6/105-2046243/) part. what do you guys think?                                                                                                                    
**INFO** **Mal Duncan**                                               
Mal is  pretty new character to most people. but believe it or not he was created in 1970. he was a member of the teen titans and the dune patrol. and as we all know he is currently a member of yj.  Malcolm Duncan was the wielder of the Gabriel Horn.and in the comics his wife is Bumblebee.i personally think the way he originally joined teen titans was really cool he  saved the Teen Titans from a street gang called the Hell Hawks by beating their leader in a [boxing match!](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aRlsFLu0MA8/TWEXmP1klPI/AAAAAAAAE20/aJMeXJfQFzg/s1600/Teen+Titans+26-21.jpg) Also in the comics He is an accomplished jazz musician and owns a nightclub named [heralds horn!](http://www.titanstower.com/assets/whos%20who/_whos_80s/Herald_whos_80s.jpg). During the JLA/Titans event, Mal acquires a new Gabriel's Horn after he discovered that the horn weakens the boundaries between the mortal world and Limbo, he destroys it, and briefly joins the short-lived Titans LA. In the Titans Tomorrow storyline, the Mal of the alternate future becomes president of the Eastern United States! And last time i checked like a year after the events in Infinite Crisis(could be more), Mal has joined the Doom Patrol alongside his wife Bumblebee. he goes by vox at this point.Mal speaks with a synthesized voice box which can create sonic blasts and open dimensional portals similar to the Gabriel Horn.

**POWERS**                                                                                      As Guardian, he wore an exoskeleton that gave him super strength. As Hornblower he carried a horn which could teleport himself and others and help in battle.and as vox  he speaks with a synthesized voice box which can create sonic blasts and open dimensional portals. He also has a background in boxing and is in good physical shape.

**INFO**      **BLUE BEETLE**                                                       
His real name is [Jamie Reyes](http://www.titanstower.com/assets/whos%20who/aamembers/individualimages/bluebeetle_jaime.jpg).he was a relatively normal high school student from El Paso, Texas. Jaime and his family are Mexican-American Catholics. Jaime’s father Alberto runs a garage. Jaime offered to work for his father, but Alberto rejected his offer, regarding Jaime's education as paramount,his mother is a paramedic and he also had a little sister whos kinda a brat.(random fact(Jaime's deepest desire is to be a dentist.) When the mystic scarab of the Blue Beetle landed in El Paso, he found the strange bug-like artifact. That night, the fabled scarab found a new symbiotic host by fusing to Jaime's [spine](http://www.titanstower.com/assets/whos%20who/aapanels/teentitans3OYL/BlueBeetle_IC5a.jpg). Jaime awoke babbling alien languages and hearing unintelligible communications from the scarab. It was trying to tell him that whenever he faced danger, the scarab would expand to create a super-powered carapace(armor) around his body he even joined the [teen titans!](http://www.titanstower.com/assets/whos%20who/aapanels/teentitans3OYL/bluebeetlejoin_tt61.jpg)!.personally i love blue beetle as a character. he's cool humorous has a unique skill set. i also love the fact that he is Mexican American. its always a good thing when dc gets diverse with their characters.

Now, assuming this is true and applies to every clone in the series, why is the young Roy (Speedy/Arsenal) so much shorter than Red Arrow? I mean, don't you think Green Arrow would be a little suspicious when Roy came to work that day nearly a foot taller?

The only explanation I have to this is that some/most genomorph clones age, and Superboy is the exception, but there's no evidence directly pointing to that."	t5_2t3l1	True

One for [Batman](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/83827431/Batman02.mp3) 

and one for [Robin](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/83827431/RobinB01.mp3).  

I really wanted one of Nightwing, but they never used his name without a lot of background noise that was too hard (for me) to filter out.  Hope you guys like em.

**Edit**
So I have the first batch done, having gone back and rewatched season 1 to see what I could pull.  Ended up with 23 odd files.  Some are crystal clear, others have background noises going on but I did what I could.  Will hopefully have season 2 done before the end of the week.

This was a bunch of fun and I had a bunch of really really great ones but it is time to close this one for now.

I will not delete so you can see the awesome tapestry that our community has going on but it is time to close it for now. From this point on I will try to do them more often so after next week we might have another so if you didnt get to ask for one here look out for another text flair give away coming soon. 

.

----

Like the title says comment here if you want me to add a **text** flair after your username on this sub. 

For example: ""apologies, meat!"" 

Also specify a color! We have burgundy, maroon, yellow, orange, red, blue, green, lime, teal, and so on

allonsy-y!

EDIT: Note: css wont recognize ""burgundy"" as a color, is maroon an okay substitute?

I have liked this season a little bit, but not as much as the first season. This episode in itself changes that for me. Everything leading up to it just seems better now, even if most of it was predicted on here already. If you haven't seen it, I advise you do. I won't talk about the story too much for anyone that hasn't seen it yet, but for those that have: Did anyone get the feel that the writers knew that could be the last episode unless something changed? Something just felt different about it, like the issue presented was kind of forced. To add onto that, where it left off could just as easily be picked up for a TV movie to finish the story as it would be for some episodes which gives the writers/producers more leeway in asking CN for some airtime.

Either way, its a load of BS that its probably going to end there. Great episode. I don't see why DC nation can't be moved to another night. This would allow for the kiddies to have their Saturday morning cartoons and let the rest of us have watch our shows. It could even be a lead in for adult swim."	t5_2t3l1	True

1376068946.0	1k1cc1	Discussion Time!! Characters: Robin/Nightwing [Spoilers]	UsagiTaicho	25	3	9	"Ok guys, it's been a while since my last/first discussion, I got busy. So let's get started.

Dick Grayson started off in season 1 as the experienced crime fighter but woefully unprepared for leadership Robin. He, like the other characters from season one, had great development. He's a bit obsessed with words, loves to laugh as he disappears and hacks computers, and he has a very good skill set. 

We got to see some real touching moments from him, and learned about who he wanted to be. And when he told Black Canary that he didn't want to be Batman, it touched us. When he took the team on a secret mission and didn't tell anyone in order to clear the Haly Circus's name, we learned that he didn't trust everyone, not even Batman.

In season two, Dick had stepped away from his role as Robin and became Nightwing, and a coordinator for the Team. We learned in the comics that the ladies couldn't resist him, and in the show that he was willing to go to extreme lengths for the mission, including not telling his friends and teammates about Aqualad and Artemis's undercover work.

He didn't get as much development in season two due to all of the new characters. It was interesting to see how he gave the leadership of the Team back to Aqualad after wanting it so much in season one. It was also interesting to learn that his not wanting to be Batman extended to not wanting to be a hero, at least for a little while. 

Perhaps one of the most interesting things was his refusal to join the Justice League, despite his standing invitation. Dick always stayed focused on the mission, but he always dug deeper than the surface, that's why they learned of Superboy. 

So the topic of this discussion is Dick's personality, character traits, actions and development. Go wild. Pick something and we'll have a conversation about it. What's your favorite Dick moment? Did you like him better as Nightwing or Robin? What development for him would you like to see in a season 3? Why didn't he fight more in season 2? "	t5_2t3l1	True

These shows all made up the first mainstream expanded comic book universe. We got to see our favorite superheroes (and hawkgirl) span across several critically acclaimed and nerdtastic shows  (okay maybe not Static Shock but it was still fun). However, for all their brilliance, most of the DCAU was held back by two things. 1) A younger target audience, especially for Justice League, mainly of the 7-12 variety. 2) Restrictions on the use of the bat family in the JL shows which made much of the crossover aspect seem superficial (where the fuck were the younger heroes during that episode where all the adults were banished?) For reasons unknown, the first badass Robin ever shown to the non-comic reading audience was trapped in his own completely separate universe in Teen Titans.
TLDR; The DCAU was awesome but it was lacking in the level of crossover/expansiveness and more serious stories later on.

So, bring it back to Young Justice. We have already an expanded JL, a mix between the Titans and the Outsiders, and the makings of a Red Hood Outlaw's gang. We have several villain groups, political opposition and the seamless crossover of basically every major DC superhero. But it is one show, and it seems like a missed opportunity to not do more. We all loved that Justice League voting scene. It's clear this league is more complex and more mature than the DCAU one. So, what would you guys think about a 2nd DCAU? Young Justice, Justice League, The Outlaws, maybe eventually an Outsiders show if the upcoming Young Justice split is coming as expected. It could allow for us to experience all of these awesome characters without feeling like the show is getting overcrowded. What shows would you want to see? Who would be the focus of each? And how reliant on each other should the shows be? Thoughts?"	t5_2t3l1	True

Thats right an official Reddit /r/youngjustice role play group! the way this works is that we will have you all make a new reddit account (this is where having [RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) would come in handy). We will only approve submitters who tell us what character they are playing as. As for right now we are only looking for 10 people, five heroes and five villains. The cool thing is they dont have to be canon characters (in addition to that we are also not allowing the big seven Leaguers such as Batman, Superman, Green Lantern the two of them, Green Arrow, Martian manhunter, Wonder Woman, The Flash) you could play as Booster Gold, or Mirror Master. We will only approve of accounts who we know who the user is. So with that being said **STOP RIGHT HERE!**



First: pm me what character you want to play.

Second: after I give you the okay make the account, it is important to remember that we will only be accepting accounts with the prefix of ""YJRP_&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;character name&gt;"". For example YJRP_Batman.

Third: one account for person. 



Characters/accounts Not Allowed:

YJRP_Batman

YJRP_Superman

YJRP_GreenLantern_1 or YJRP_GreenLantern_2 (keep in mind this is the only account that can have numbers)

**EDIT: IMPORTANT UPDATE:** We currently have four registered heroes and only one registered Villain, we need at least three more villains (remember they don't need to be canon).**

**EDIT 2: IMPORTANT UPDATE:** All hero positions have been closed. Still need two more villains. Don't worry this is just the trial run we will be admitting and allowing more characters after we run this first event."	t5_2t3l1	True

Shows I've already seen and recommend:

**Batman The Animated Series**

Excellent show if you want more Batman. The animation quality varies, but other than that it's solid, and the opening theme/sequence is incredible.

**Justice League (Unlimited)**

Closest thing there is to more Young Justice. Some really incredible episodes and storylines, recommended to watch on dvd or computer, as often stories are told over 2 or 3 episodes.

**Avatar: The Last Airbender** (and the sequel series: **Legend of Korra**)

The first season of The Last Airbender is a little shallow, but the action scenes are excellent and it gets extremely good for the second and third season. The movie is awful, don't watch it. The sequel series, Legend of Korra, is in my mind the best cartoon series ever. It *can* be enjoyed if you haven't seen The Last Airbender, but watching it all in order is highly recommended.

Any thoughts about what will happen after the break?	whatevrmn	24	3	85	"As we're all (probably) aware of, YJ is on break until September. This means we have a few months to kill. Which tv shows is everyone watching? The Summer is a pretty dry time for our DVRs, so it's a good time to get caught up on shows we've either been putting off. For instance I'm going to get caught up on Game of Thrones. 

Anyone have an idea of what's going to happen when the show comes back on? I'm hoping that we will finally get an Aqualad heavy show and hopefully some flashbacks as to why they decided he should go undercover. "	t5_2t3l1	True

Anyhow it is clear that even though there is a lot of acclaim for the YJ things are looking grim because of poor merchandise sales which is a key part to children's television. 

So on top of tweeting @cartoonnetwork with the #saveyoungjustice we should support the show in other ways.

I know spending money isn't very exciting but I know personally I rarely watch episodes live and honestly haven't spent a cent that would help support the show. CN needs to see revenue before they continue this. 

The hiatus might be helpful if we can use the extra time before the season ends to show interest.

1373743673.0	1i8dt7	We need content, so this is my first discussion thread. The topic is: Season 3. Do I really need to say spoilers?	UsagiTaicho	29	10	19	"I know there have been a lot of posts about what could happen, I even made some of them. But individually, they don't get a lot of comments. Could be the number of people in the sub, could be traffic. This particular sub doesn't show up often on my front page, so I don't visit for sometimes weeks at a time.

Anyway, let's get down to it shall we? For season 3, which sadly doesn't look like it is coming out anytime soon, or possibly at all, holds many possibilities.  
There is of course the Light's deal with Darkseid, whatever that may be.  
There is the growth and development of many of the season two characters that didn't get much attention due to the number of them.  
And there is the introduction of new characters/returning characters.

Let's look at what we can assume:  
*There will be another time-skip. Not really necessary, and I would prefer there to not be one, at least not another five year one. Maybe a one-year later thing.  

*Nightwing will not be an active hero, unless the time skip is a big one. I would personally like to see clips of Dick Grayson, perhaps in college or applying to a police academy rather than in costume. If the skip is more than a year, I'd like to see him as a cop, that would be cool.  

*The Flash will be thinking of retirement. After all, he has two kids to think of, he really shouldn't be doing the costume thing anymore, at least for a while. This will probably upset Impulse/NKF  

*Let's see some development of those characters shall we? With the original sidekicks all grown up, we should focus on the relationships between the new ones and their mentors. Static Shock and Black Lightning, Tim/Robin and Batman, Cassie and Wonder Woman.  

*And of course, The Light. What's their new plan? What are they doing? Why Darkseid? What's going on? On 
second thought, maybe we should just ignore that and let the surprises come.

Now, what I would love to see:  
*The Red Hood. What better way to get Dick back into the costume than a new villain that is targeting him and the rest of the Batkids and seems to know who they are? This would also be a good way to transition the Batgirls, as Babs could get shot or just give it up and be living with Dick. Without the mantle hanging over their heads, perhaps Dick would finally be ready for her. Read the Invasion comic guys, you'll know what I'm talking about.  
That was a long one.  

*I would also love to see the return of Wally West. Now, that said, I think that his return would be better pulled off in a five-year time skip. Missing for five years, suddenly to return and dressed in a different Flash costume. He could have been sent to an alternate timeline for the last five years and joined their Justice League while trying to find his way back home. Obviously he was super-charged by the Speed Force and is now the Fastest Man Alive, and ready to take his Uncle's place. The Team and the League, dealing with the return of other previously thought dead heroes, would no doubt be untrusting of him. Eventually he would prove himself though.  

*Some femme fatale development. I would like to see Cassie more fully developed, the introduction of Stephanie Brown either as Spoiler or preferably Batgirl, and please of please show us Supergirl. Seriously, these three are some of my favorite female teens from the comics, they need to be introduced and developed. I would really like to see Cassie get more comfortable and take on a leadership role like she held in the Titans. And more Zatanna!  
Some more Justice League time. With some of the original Team joining the League at this time, it would be hard not to include them. Maybe a spin-off show that features them, with the episodes taking place at the same time, and lots of crossovers.

I can't think of anything else right now, so I guess I will leave it for the next discussion.

1362898782.0	1a0iwn	[Hypothetical Situation] An animated movie and a Bat-family series set in the same universe	jade-E	18	1	8	"How would you guys feel about this: 

Due to fan outcry Warner Brothers realizes that there is high demand for a continuation of the Young Justice series. The ""Beware the Batman"" program does not fare nearly as well as YJ did--but they both were lacking something for WB: numbers. Merchandise numbers for the Young Justice show--and viewer numbers for the Beware the Batman show. 

So Warner Bros decides to return to the YJ Earth 16 for television, but not for the entirety of the DC Universe--for the Bat Family. The Young Justice Universe brings scores of fans because of it's strong storytelling and ability to dig into and breath life into the DC Comics' mythos--and the Batman cast makes for easy merchandising because of the various gadgets allow for widespread toy design and the demand for Batman merch in general is always high. 

But WB knows it cannot return to animating Earth-16 without wrapping up the Light story--the fans simply wouldn't have it and they're banking on bringing in the fanbase to help sustain the new show. So they make a DC Animated Feature called Young Justice: The Light or something that would give closure to the story. Perhaps even do a two-part feature like they did with The Dark Knight Returns, since the DC animated movies are only allowed to be 80 minutes total. 

With that wrapped up they pull in this new series: ""Batman: Incorporated."" In the past year or two in the comics, Bruce Wayne admits to where the Batman and Co get all the money for their gear: his company (and somehow ties it into a way that shows the public that he's more an acquaintance of Batman's instead of his alter ego--ala Spider-Man and Peter Parker the photographer). Doing this he sets up Batman Incorporated, a Wayne Enterprises funded mission for Batman to unite different allies (many Batman-esque) throughout the world. Whenever Bruce is out of town pairing up with other heroes, Gotham is under the watch of Dick Grayson (Nightwing), Batgirl, and Damian Wayne (Robin); he also sends Tim Drake (Red Robin) with his own team, The Outsiders, to do covert ops like YJ functions in the animated series. 

This leaves the show with three intertwining story-lines; similar to the multiple ones YJ juggles. 

1. We get to see Batman team up with various heroes around the globe in the vain of ""The Brave and The Bold,"" albeit with a darker and more mature tone. 

2. We see Dick and Damian (along with whomever else happens to be in town) solve crimes in Gotham for more traditional styled Batman stories. 

3. We see Tim Drake lead his Outsiders team (who could very well have members of Young Justice, or just be Young Justice itself--the YJ show didn't really follow the YJ plot either) on covert ops like the first season of Young Justice.

This also allows for more exploration into certain Batman stories (like the Hush arc or even Batman's death and Dick taking up the mantle) and introduce members of the Bat-Family (like Damian Wayne, Jason Todd, Stephanie Brown Spoiler) that would otherwise not make it to the small screen.

So Warner Bros gets both its viewers and merchandise. Would you be interested in this at all?"	t5_2t3l1	True

1360738881.0	18flzj	Speculation about Blue Beetle  (50% chance of spoilage).	noblethrasher	19	1	14	"Blue Beetle will return from the dark side (obviously) but it’s the *scarab* that breaks the Reach’s control.

Firstly, *Jaime is not the BB from Impulse’s timeline*. 

Evidence: We know that there are two histories of the Reach Apocalypse: the one that Impulse came back to avert (`T1`) and the one that is “currently” playing out (`T2`).  In `T1`, BB started off as a hero and at some point turned to the dark side. Yet in `T2` we know that the Reach could not reboot the scarab unless they first separated it from Jaime (killing him in the process). So Jaime cannot be the BB that Impulse saw in `T1` because he was killed whenever the Reach rebooted the scarab. *QED*.

Secondly, while the scarab is psychopathic, it only ever exhibited extreme self-preservation impulses, not merely homicidal ones.  So right up until the instant before the “successful” reboot, the scarab would have been fighting for its life, just as we witnessed in “Darkest”, “Before Dawn”, and the beginning of “True Colors”. I predict that it manages to subvert the Reach’s influence in some manner similar to Red Tornado’s trick for Starro-tech.

Finally, consider the resolution of BB’s character arc. Jaime needs to end up as someone who is no longer conflicted (to “make peace with the one inside him” as Mr. Longshadow put it). If indeed it is the scarab that manages to save him then he will finally learn that he can trust it.

1349540976.0	111ok4	So Blue Beetle must be pretty important.	Dahuuuuuudge	20	2	18	"I was watching the episode where Impulse comes back from the future, and he says the name of everyone who is with him, Beast Boy, Robin, Nightwing, and a fourth name, Blue Beetle. He asks where the Beetle is, ""Actually Beast Boy is two words. Like Blue Beetle! Is he here?""

It's pretty obvious that the light's associate is the Black Beetle, so considering the death of Ted Kord, or his reported death, the light must have wanted to give his scarab to Black Beetle. That means that Black is in charge of the dirty Kroloteans.

So if Black Beetle is an alien warlord, then that means that the blue scarab is an alien armor, like in the comics. But, this is all I can figure out right now. Like Artemis, Superboy, and Miss Martian before them. I think Blue Beetle and Impulse will have an important focus on them this season.

They must want the scarab, because in Darkness, they were after Blue Beetle the whole time. Beast Boy and Impulse were extras."	t5_2t3l1	True

I came up with Blue Beetle because,

1) He is becoming much more powerful than the rest of the team as shown by ""War"". There's no tension if one guy is much better than the rest.

2) I don't think he will be able to get the Scarab back to the way it was and if he cant it removes what was interesting about his character essentially just pushing him into the background, which we have more than enough of with Robin, Batgirl ect. 

3) When they defeat the Reach his arc will most likely be tied up. They could have been planning to start a new arc with him next season but with another time skip and many new characters (and old ones we know nothing about) it would be foolish. But he cant just be pushed off to the side because of how important he has been. It would be like Wally all over again.

4) He is going to feel terrible when he gains control again and the easiest way to redeem himself is self sacrifice to bring down The Reach.

Another candidate for death is Kaldur/Artemis mainly to really turn everyone against Nightwing and because they are originals.

When I first watched, I incorrectly assumed the last letter of the Greek alphabet was zeta (like zed).  I thought ""Oh, since they'll be gone for a while and the team on Earth might need the letters closer to the beginning for whatever reason.""

But then I remembered recently that zeta is not the last letter of the Greek alphabet--it's omega.

Then I googled the Greek alphabet and saw that zeta is the ~~fifth~~ sixth letter.  Why use the ~~fifth~~ sixth letter for the fourth squad?

If Nightwing was going in order, he would have designated them Delta Squad since delta is the fourth letter.

So who was Delta Squad and Epsilon Squad if all team members were accounted for on Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Zeta?

I think this might have been a small foreshadowing of Aqualad's role in this season's story arc.  And possibly another secret mission Nightwing might be directing.

~~Aqualad and Artemis are Epsilon Squad.~~  There are two squads unaccounted for.

Or Zeta just sounds cooler, whatever.

A few things I like about young justice are:the story telling. It's like a narrative. I love how there's this big story in this new universe and how it makes me feel connected ya know? Something else is the overall art direction. The art looks beautiful in HD I prefer this style to the blocky 3D style other shows are using.  And lastly the introduction of new characters that aren't mainstream.  It's really cool that some of the lessor known characters are getting put in the spotlight.                                              

And now on to the bad: some of the character development for some of the lesser known characters is lacking in my opinion.  Prime example is rocket.  A really cool character who hasn't been used to her potential. Would go into detail but you know would go off on a tangent.  Next thing is.... Wow i can't really think of too many things I don't like about the show... Wait lagoon boy...  There we go those are my few gripes and grievances.                                   

And lastly I what I would change I would just make the show an hour long show.   I think it would be great for the ability to have character development and be able to do alot more with the show.

Two that is most notable to me is when Roy is questioning Cheshire in her cell, he says ""What is your End Game?!"" End Game being the name of the season finale of Season 2.

The second is the Wally centered episode where he delivers the heart. One of the schools cancelled is ""Spizak High"". Jason Spizak is Wally's voice actor. Pretty cool stuff I didn't catch the first time.

Cardenjs	16	2	7	"Young Justice is by all means a great show, I watched the show religiously and was just as angry when the show went on it's third hiatus and I joined the petitions when it was announced that there would be no more seasons of Young Justice. 

Watching some of my favorite episodes, I noticed that a good chunk of its content, its jokes, its substance, can only be fully appreciated by people who grew up on DC. Many things go unsaid, some of which it seems like they are saying ""this is a detail from the comics that carries over to Young Justice"" without saying anything at all. The show is full of Cameos, all of which we would love to see expanded because we know who they are, but that's all lost on new viewers. 

Young Justice is a great piece of work, and even though it is not getting renewed, the least we can do is say thank you to its creators, for a job well done in the eyes of DC fans everywhere, and hope that their next endeavor with DC is more successful in the eyes of Cartoon Network, Warner Brothers, DC-fans and new viewers alike.

For villains in the new episodes, maybe a Cassandra Cain pre-Batgirl assassin, Rose Wilson as Ravager as a traitor, an introduction of Damian Wayne who tries to kill Tim Drake for the position of Robin.

I'd love to see Ryan Choi, but considering Bumblebee is Atom's protégé, and The Atom is Ray Palmer, that seems unlikely to happen.

2) I want a Bat-Family centric episode. Dick, Babs, Tim, and Bruce all working together. 

3) Superman hanging out with Conner. I mean i'm not the biggest superman fan, hell I dislike the character greatly but I really do like Superboy (maybe its the tortured mentality or the humanity that he has to deal with but superboy is up there with my favorite charactes) and after the scene in Auld Acquaintances where its essentially Superman accepting Conner how hard is it to get more of that. Maybe some scenes where they are hanging around Metropolis and Conner and Supes are talking having some father-son moments.

1362892147.0	1a0dzw	Is Black Beetle off-mode?	lazythinker	15	3	6	"After watching this week's episode, there's been a question I've been playing with throughout the day. We've seen throughout this season, ever since Black Beetle's introduction, that he has an impressive amount of autonomy within the Reach organization. It seems that when given mission directives by the Reach ambassador, he is able to willingly fulfill those directives out however he wishes to do so. It also seems as if he is also capable of acting against orders, as we see during the parley between the Light and the Reach this week. 

Another interesting thing I noticed, as I'm sure many of you did as well, was how he basically told the Reach ambassador to go fuck himself. Now this might not be strange, except for the fact that the Reach ambassador, the Reach's representative and de facto man in charge ordered Black Beetle to save them. If Black Beetle were indeed on mode, surely he would have done as ordered and saved the ambassador and the scientist without question. But the fact that Black Beetle was able to refuse and even cite Reach protocol leads me to believe that he is indeed able to act autonomously of the Reach and perhaps even fooled the Reach ambassador and scientists into thinking he is ""on-mode"".

If this is true, then this means that Black Beetle is far more dangerous than previously let on. The Reach's main goal was to take over Earth as per the agreement with the Light and as stipulated by the treaty between the Reach and the Green Lantern Corps. However, Black Beetle seems to have gone against the Reach's main objective for Earth and is calling for total annihilation. Surely if he was still ""on-mode"" he would value submission over destruction, but because he may be ""off-mode"" he is willing to take those steps and do so without the Reach or anyone stopping him from doing so.

I take this evidence from how we've seen the Reach interact with Blue Beetle. One could argue that the Reach allow more autonomy to those scarab infused servants that have been in the fold for some time. I could accept that as a valid argument, however I also think there's something to be said for Black Beetle again ignoring a direct order from a head of command during a time of crisis.

ReluctantPirateGames	14	0	7	"Thanks to another post, it has come to my attention that there is significant interest in a little Tournament of Heroes (Teen Titans, anyone?) during the hiatus. Other subreddits have and continue to run these events, and it always generates good discussion. Unless someone else really wants to organize this, I will be the [Master of Games](http://teentitans.wikia.com/wiki/Master_Of_Games) of this little event, and I will try to post a new fight everyday, starting tomorrow.


A little bit about the rules: There will be 32 participants. These range from team members to young villians to some animals and robots. Timeline continuity is NOT going to be enforced. I will specify which version (season 1 or season 2) of the character is fighting. For instance, both Tim Drake and Dick Grayson will be teens in this tournament. Miss Martian will still have long hair, but Beast Boy won't just be some kid with a famous mom.


The bracket can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuuCSQIOHy7mdENtQUxzMno4dFNXTG40aHhkOVFpakE). The tournament is semi-seeded to avoid big fights happening early. Again, each post will contain more details about the fight, and I will try to answer any questions as they come in.

**EDIT**: For obvious reasons, I may need some help on this. If someone wants to be my partner in this endeavor, it would help. Basically I just need someone who can post and tally fights on days that I cannot.

**MOAR EDITS**: Looks like this was caught in the spam filter. We'll start tomorrow (saturday) just so people get a chance to see this before it begins."	t5_2t3l1	True

OR create some new shows to create a new universe to go with yj and gl.

As soon as I saw that they were ""In Bruges"" I was hoping for a racist dwarf or at least a reference to Bruges being like it's straight out of a fucking fairy tale book, but I digress.

Connor got a little to happy with his Shields this week, and I have to wonder if they aren't a reference to the slappers we saw in Batman Beyond. They could also contain something that allows Luthor to more easily control Connor if he wants. Since we're not very familiar with **this** version of Luthor, it's harder to speculate. 

I still question the addition of Red Arrow to the team. He's a great archer, but so is Artie. He also seemed to give up on the 'mole' rather quickly. Whether or not he did this for show will be decided in the coming episodes. 

When did Kid Flash learn about Robin's backstory? Did it happen in an episode, or was it an offscreen thing? All in all I really enjoy those two being such good friends, and it was a good call leaving KF at home during the mission. 

I really wanted Robin to be the one to throw the flammable liquid on Parasite. Just as a little nod to [Justice League](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=4Qt42ASS1Rg#t=360s).

About Wally, I know how he can come back. I have a comic where Wally, as Flash, traveled into the future using the Speed Force.

If you haven't seen the SMGO update on Youtube yet, I suggest you look it up. WB wants around 10 million to get the show back on the air and that 10 million is just used to cover production costs. 
Okay, 10 million is a massive number for production costs but it should have been expected. However, that 10 million is repaid to those who originally put it out (producers, etc.) in spades. If we (the fans) raise this money, we never get it back and the producers get all the publicity. If we are to raise the money, we should put conditions on it, such as production of two seasons. 

We could also ask them to meet us in the middle. If we get to 7 million, they should fund the other 3 million since we already demonstrated our will to get that far.
They set the bar really high because they don't think we can reach it, and, if we prove them wrong, I'm willing to bet some person at the top will greedily grab at the money or do something to get it, because let's be honest, it's always about the money. 

But let's be realistic here as well. We have, at the time I'm typing this, 3,405 subscribers to this subreddit and 523 on the Green Lantern subreddit. If we count all the subscribers as individuals (and there are definitely subscribers that are on both, but just go with me on this) then there are 3,928 total subscribers, nearly 4,000. Let's just round to 4,000 to make easy calculations. WB wants $10,000,000 (that's a big number) and we have only 4,000 people. That means $2,500 a person to get to the goal. I know I don't have that money and most of you don't either. 

All hope isn't lost though, if we count all of the DC Comic subreddit subscribers. There's 14,036 of them and if we count them as individuals, although some are probably subscribed to both this one and Green Lantern as well, that brings the total number of Redditors to 17,964. So now, each person only has to shell out $556.67, which is a much more reasonable, although impossible amount since not every person will want to or can donate that much. 

At our best, we can muster 20,000 Redditors, which means that each person needs to donate $500, which I'm willing to bet will never happen. Of course, there are other outside sources of funding such as those people on Tumblr, DeviantArt, etc. that would be willing to chip in but we won't get that unless there is an active effort. 
This post is in no way a post to demotivate anyone from donating. It is only here to bring a little realism and reality to the scene. If we can raise that money, we will need a much stronger negotiation because otherwise we are throwing away our efforts on the producers, who will give us a new season, but may just close it after that season no matter how successful it was. 

A couple baseline things to cover if you do decide to fight for the show.

1) Don't stop: Once you start, keep fighting, even if all hope seems lost. It is your support that gets the show back on. Don't wait for someone else to do it, social loafing just makes the whole system come down.

2) Be polite: This should go without saying. I know we all get mad at TTG and Beware the Batman (BTB?) but there is no reason to curse them out or just be rude. No one wants to debate with someone who is being rude and being rude will not help us get our goal, it will just hold us back. No matter what we do, don't be the guy/girl that sends the angry, hate filled email/tweet/whatever-cool-people-use because it will not be received well. Be respectful

3) Organize: Don't do this alone. We have a great community here with great mods who can lead us to do great things. If you want to send emails or tweets in a spam form, first, be respectful in them, but also get others to help. We should plan a day where we all just simply continue to spam one inbox or account to lower the bar they want for a new season. 10 million is simply an impossible amount that they want to deter us. But if we organize and set up a better relationship between us all, we can get this done as a team. In fact, we can be The Team.

Essentially, get everyone you know to give in 10 dollars. If you can get 10 people to do it, we're already on course. Keep fighting!"	t5_2t3l1	True

NinJaen	17	5	10	"would it be beneficial to seek out help from viewers/fans of other shows like My little Pony: Friendship is magic and Avatar: Legend of Korra? Honestly YJ and these shows were what I looked forward to most to watch in the past couple of years. Both fan bases grew than expected.

MLP: FIM was intentionally for a younger audience but got the attention of a demographic beyond the age group and came on early mornings on a channel that most people don't have. 

Avatar: LOK was supposed to be a miniseries but due to a wide number of audience, in fact highest number of viewers for animated series of 2012; MLP coming in second, added on more episodes and a new season. 

Is there something that we're not doing that these shows have? I know some will have preferences over others but I love all of these shows and I'm of the older demographic and Im sure there are plenty others like me too. I'm sure fans of the other shows would enjoy YJ and GL for many reasons:

Good storyline and episodes, great animation, character favorites, and many Voice Actors are getting recognition that some of the fans love ex: [Grey Deleslie](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0217221/), [Mae Whitman] (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0926165/), etc. 

So I wanted to know what you guys think? Instead of just going to the other sub reddits I wanted to get some input. Also, should we do seek help from the other viewers in the other subreddits I think it would be best to have someone here be a representative and have one post rather than just bombard them with a bunch of post to watch and support YJ and GL

Focus on Nightwing, M'gann, Bart, Jaime, Kaldur, and Artemis	Shiniholum	13	2	41	"The first season of the show may have been about a rag tag team of sidekicks who are in the middle of a vast villain conspiracy, and was a lot slower and ""lighter"" than its successor. Season 2 of the show (in my own opinion) is much darker and is dealing with a lot more branches and themes. Certain characters have had to make certain decisions, certain decisions that may fall within a moral grey area. 

I started this discussion because I am curious to what you guys feel about each of the characters and the decisions and secrets that they have made. 

For example I will put in a brief outline after this:

&gt;Nightwing:

&gt; * His entire plan to infiltrate The Light

&gt;M'gann:

&gt; * The use of her telepathy, the lobotomization, and disregard for well...others heads

&gt;Bart:

&gt; * Disregard for Butterfly Effect, not telling anyone why he was really in the past 

&gt;Jaime:

&gt; * Not a major one but him not telling the team about the whole multiple personality thing he has going on with a homicidal alien killing machine

&gt;Kaldur:

&gt; * Involvement with Nightwing, kidnapping of innocent people/kids

&gt;Artemis:

&gt; * Involvement with Nightwing and faking her death"	t5_2t3l1	True

Hear me out on this. What if Cartoon Network is smarter than we are all thinking right now?

Think about it. This is the perfect way to see just how popular that block really is. The phrase “You don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone” comes to mind.

My thought process is this (and this is purely speculative):

* CN started this block back in March with only two shows and some shorts

* CN didn’t know just how popular this block was going to end up being

* CN might have had some discussion as to whether they should continue

* CN said they would add two new shows to the block

* CN was debating how many episodes to order of the new shows

* CN wasn’t sure just how strong the fandom was for their block

* CN abruptly pulls DC Nation to figure it out


It’s really a brilliant publicity move here. Sure, they’re not getting good press right now, but it’s still press. And the word about DC Nation is spreading. As is support for it.

Because nothing can stop the strength of a fandom. "	t5_2t3l1	True

Firstly, it can be pretty much anyone,a teenaged version of an adult hero who hasn't been introduced yet.a teenaged superhero who hasn't even been mentioned etc you get the jist.                            

**BASIC INFORMATION**                                                          
For my pick i feel compelled to go with my username namesake [Wiseson](http://www.comicvine.com/wise-son/29-59910/all-images/108-213183/wise_son/105-702638/).I linked a picture for people who haven't seen(or heard of him before)his real name is Hannibal White. he is 18-19 years old in the comics.I believe he is a good fit for yj in many ways.He is a natural born leader(in fact he is the second Leader of the [Blood Syndicate](http://www.comicvine.com/blood-syndicate/65-44509/all-images/108-195884/blood_syndicate/105-1172282/)).Admittly,he is a bit hot tempered.He is also very inspirational. 

**POWERS**                                                                            
his skin is made up of an ultra-dense molecular structure, Wise Son is, to the extent thus far demonstrated, beyond the reach of physical harm.And to a degree super strength. He can still be stunned or knocked unconscious (as demonstrated in his fight with Icon), though this requires quite a bit of effort.Also he discovered in the latter part of his career that he could also temporarily bestow some of his protective powers upon others while touching them. i think that if he joined yj he would be a powerhouse of the team.Who would immediately contribute.                                                                                               

**HISTORY**                                                                                                  

Wise Son is a Bang Baby, a gang member who received superhuman powers in the wake of the Big Bang. The Big Bang was supposed to be a rumble between all of the major gangs of Paris Island to settle their turf wars, once and for all. The Dakota City Police Department learned of the impending showdown and developed a special tear gas that also contained a radioactive marker. Their plan was to use the gas to break up the Big Bang and then trace the gang members down the next day by tracing the radioactive ""tags."" Instead, most of those exposed to the tear gas died, and the handful of surviving gang members that lived had all developed superhuman abilities.   

One of the Bang Babies, Rolando Texador, he took the name Tech-9. Texador gathered his fellow survivors together with a proposal. Tech-9 wanted to form a new gang, the Blood Syndicate, with the aim of achieving substantive positive social change. They took over an abandoned door factory, which they simply dubbed The Factory. Operating from The Factory, the Blood Syndicate smashed crack houses throughout Paris Island, trying to rid the neighborhood of the dealers while taking the money captured in these operations to fund their activities. In the course of their work they would acquire new members, and put an end to many threats in Paris Island.

Wise Son assumed leadership of the Blood Syndicate after the death of Tech-9, though he was not as capable a leader as Tech-9 was at first. As time went on, Wise Son grew into the role, and became an active influence in the community as a whole ; he was even able to stop a riot during the Utopia Park project by speaking to the crowd. to quote him ""We are men and women. The most powerful, beautiful, most intelligent creatures on the planet...in life itself...despite what we believe of ourselves sometimes."" (...) ""We can't let this anger...this outrage get the best of us. We can't let anyone else get hurt now. Because we are human...because we are men and women. We have to stop.""                                                                                             

**PERSONALITY**                                                                                            

Wise Son *was* a very angry man : angry with the injustices of American society, angry with the violence on his streets, angry with the circumstances of his personal life. He turned to Islam to get a sense of empowerment, but only followed the trappings and eschewed the actual teachings and lifestyle. During his time with the Blood Syndicate Wise Son has matured a great deal, learning to deal with his emotions more rationally and embracing Islam as an uplifting influence instead of simply paying it lip service. Wise Son has become a very inspirational person, and was actually able to quell a riot by addressing the crowd, as i stated earlier.

A similar progression of maturity can also be seen in Wise Son's personal life. Initially he was a self-serving misogynist who actively avoided responsibility toward the others in his life. The events of the Blood Syndicate series and even more notably the Wise Son: White Wolf mini-series made him rethink his priorities. Wise Son consequently became more actively involved with the lives of his family, his children, and their mother than he was before.the progression and development of his character really made me admire the character.and gain a deeper respect for him.                                                     

**CLOSING COMMENTS**                                                                                   

i honestly feel that Wiseson would be a good fit for yj. of course they will have change somethings about his back story.that comes without saying. (hell it was the 90's superman had a mullet.) lol things change.Wiseson is a very unique individual, he shows a lot of inspirational and leadership skills,his power set would be an huge asset to the team,and i believe if given a chance he could become a fan favorite.                          

TLDR wiseson is my choice. He is a very unique, a great leader, and a diverse individual. would be a good fit for the team.for many reasons stated above."	t5_2t3l1	True

Okay so here it goes, I will try to be brief but I make no promises. And trust me I know that statement holds almost no water as of late but just to say it: “I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.” 
Here are the bullet points of my life from when I had to disappear:

* School and Finals


* The Coma following Finals Week


* Family Relations

* *Personal* Relations

* Work


And here we go.

----


**School**

So as you know my school life is hectic, like really hectic, dual majors of Law and Forensics I am sure at this point and juncture **will** kill me. My final two weeks of the semester was absolutely horrendous. I spent so much time in the library and away from a computer and distractions as I could have been.  I was sleep deprived and not eating and in other words regular college stuff. 

My finals themselves were brutal they were three days of nonstop torture and trying to stay awake. I had one final in particular that I was really honest to god worried about (to be completely honest I did not do all that great in) and so I had to really maximize my study time. 

Now right before I could leave I had to take care of a few errands, these more so than prior years since I am transferring campuses and won’t be returning to the same room and school, errands such as cleaning which was an entire day (along with packing), filling paperwork, good byes, the usual stuff. 

Fast forward 2 months (and then back 4). Since I was finishing my second year I got to finally declare my major (which is when you say what you officially studying and apply for entrance into your colleges school of X [also let’s be honest I would love to be a mutant, freaking laser beams out of my eyes]). Now the whole process was very tedious and required meeting with my academic advisor, the advisors of the new school, the department head and so on. So they helped me schedule my classes and plan out the last 2 years of my bachelors. Now here’s where we flash forward; the majors that I decided upon with the so called professionals apparently no longer exists. That’s right my major and all my classes as well as everything I've been doing has been for naught. So what happened was that I got a letter in the mail saying something along the lines of:

&gt;Oh hey there we notice that you are in this major, well it doesn’t exist anymore. Hope you have fun in your upcoming year.

Which lead to the past 3 weeks of being on the phone for hours on end trying to get this sorted out. Brightside ive read 3 books during the entire time I've been on hold. 

----

**Coma**

This one is pretty self-explanatory after finals and packing and paperwork when I finally got home I feel into a near coma like state and slept for what seemed like a week. 

----

**Family**

So the only thing that disrupted my coma like state is my family. Now at first glance that may seem like an adorable concept but let me reassure you I was not a happy monkey.  We had our yearly family reunion and being an Italian… well lets just say that it was a weeklong process, yard work, cleaning, preparing; it was grueling. 

----

**Personal Relationships**

So some good news from my disappearance is that a week before finals week I started dating a wonderful girl. The week before finals they offered a trip up to New York for free and I took the opportunity to take a girl I knew up there out for a date, you know the drill fancy dinner, walk in the park, followed up by watching the sun set and then the night at her place. Great girl. I actually knew her from back in high school, we were cool and all but we never really ran in the same circles, when out of the blue last year she got in touch with me and we started talking. Turns out she moved to the city was in school for business while in her free time was a model. So this was uh pretty big for me and I wanted to make it work so after school, after my coma, and after my family event I would spend every other day commuting from PA to NY (this average commute was about 3 hours) most trips I would often spend the night and leave the following night.  This took up a huge portion of my free time and for the past 2 months cost me *a lot* of money. 

----


**Work**

So since school is out and whatnot I once again started up my job (I worked every now and then when I was at school but for the most part a 4-5 hour commute for work is well a lot and costs more to drive there then what I was being paid. 

So now I was working every other day (week days from 7am until 8:30pm and weekends from 5am until 6:30pm) Now I was working 4 days a week traveling to NJ from PA just for work (about a 2 hour commute with traffic) and then visiting my girlfriend 3 days a week traveling from PA to NY (about a 3 hour trip every other day and one time it was 5 hours since traffic). That was what my week looked like for about 2 months, May and June this was my schedule, my redditing was restrained to poops, traffic, code compiling, and a passing comment here and there. 

Following all of this I actually ended up getting my third promotion at my job, I went from just a desk job to Manager of all Interim Employees, in other words I now baby sit all the new young employees and show them the ropes. This had me now going in Mon-Wed and Fri-Sat with only Thurs and Sun as “*free*” days were then spent in NY. 

As you can see work has pretty much been dominating my life. 

----

I had originally wrote a lot more touching on my various health and bodily issues as well as going more in depth on my family events  but after thinking about it I decided to take it out. If you guys have any more questions feel free to ask. 

Listen I know that I let you guys down and I cant say sorry enough, you guys know how much I love and appreciate you all and I am going to do everything in my power to try to make it up to you. 

Now to close off: Community Comics. We have a lot to discuss. Expect a separate discussion post tomorrow. 

Also good news for you guys, Im no longer in a relationship so you guys can expect more of me. 

Once again, I'm sorry, I'm so so sorry.

And we're back. I lied about the Christmas night thing. Sorry. But the tournament goes on.

--------

**The Bad Dad Club**

*In this corner*:[Artemis](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Artemis). The daughter of Sportsmaster, at least the good one, was not well liked at first. In fact, she was on a the short list of possible moles. But since then she has proven not only her loyalty, but also her strength.

*In the other corner*: [Icicle Jr.](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Icicle_Jr.) Sharing both powers and a name with his father, Icicle Jr. appears with the rest of the ice villains in Belle Reve. His powers are enough to warrant an inhibitor, but we do know that he has a ""glass jaw,"" so that's working against him.

--------

Anyway, we are getting closer to the TBD round of the bracket, and I'm still not sure what I'm going to do. If you guys don't mind, I think I might skip that round and wait for the new episodes to see if there are some new characters we can use. We are definitely getting Herald, so we just need one more. Either way, voting for this ends in 24 hours.

**VOTING FINALLY CLOSED**

So I've found myself without reliable internet for a few days, and possibly more beyond those. I will do my best to keep up with this. And oh yeah, Artemis wins 47-4 (ouch)."	t5_2t3l1	True

We continue our tournament with some great opponents. One is new, one is old. One is good, one is bad. One uses tech, the other uses muscle. One is... alright that's getting annoying.

--------

**The Gun Show**

*In this corner*: [Blue Beetle](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Blue_Beetle). I fear this guy won't find a worthy opponent for a few rounds. He is truly awesome, both as a character and as a member of the team. That being said, his occasional inability to control his suit may lead him into trouble.

*In the other corner*: [Mammoth](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Mammoth). Not long ago, this villian was just a skinny teenager. Now he's so huge his skin tears apart from muscular overgrowth. We've seen him fight Bane, the man who broke the bat, to a standstill, so I wouldn't take him lightly. But does he have what it takes to face the power of the Reach?

--------

Another day, another round. I literally have nothing more to say about this.

**VOTING CLOSED**

41-3 is, frankly, closer than I thought this one would be. Someone commented that Blue Beetle has a chance to win it all, and that is a real possibility. He's certainly a front-runner.

Also, I will not be posting a new round until the night of Christmas day. I'm busy, and I expect that Reddit in general will have less traffic during the next two days. So look out for the next post in 48 hours."	t5_2t3l1	True

--------------

**The King of the Mountain vs. the King of the Jungle**

*In this corner*: [Dick Grayson](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Nightwing). In this tournament, we are using the Robin version of Dick Grayson, **not Nightwing**. As Robin, Dick Grayson was physically weaker than most of the team, but made up for it with greater experience and a belt full of gadgets only Batman could provide.

*In the other corner*: [Mr. Tawny](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Mr._Tawny). This Kobra-venom enhanced tiger was befriended by Captain Marvel, and has increased strength and intelligence. He is currently tasked with protecting all the animals in his forest.

* B02 – Aqualad
* B03 – Kid Flash

* B07 – Artemis
* B08 – Zatanna
* B17 – Bumblebee
* B19 – Beast Boy
* B20 – Robin (Tim Drake)

It's safe to assume B09 is Rocket, and the list doesn't include Aquagirl, Wonder Girl, Batgirl, and Lagoon Boy. However, that still leaves 5 members unaccounted for. (Assuming Blue Beetle is the newest member)

The Justice League's numbers also have a few missing:

My Theory: Tempest joined the Team, but left after Aquagirl's death. (Plus he's in the video game) 3 joined the Team but were older heroes like Roy, so they moved up to the Justice League already. As for the final one? Perhaps Jason Todd (although still no knowing if he even exists in Earth-16)

Hello ladies and gentlemen! We are proud to present you all with our completed story for week 1! Now that we have chapter one finished it is time to start our first art week for our project!

 

Here is how this works is below is the story for week one you all have a week to submit and create art to go along with the story thus far. You will use the character designs that have already been established (such as Nightwings outfit in the present time) and designs designed by our lovely user /u/GoldandBlue for creating our custom designs that haven’t been in featured in the show.

 

You guys have a week so don’t rush and take your time. **ALSO REMEMBER** there is no bad art! I (Shiniholum) will be submitting a very crappy ms paint submission. Its more about just doing what you can. Talk to other people and communicate! Also remember you **do not** need to create an entire page of art if you dont want to, pick a scene and go crazy!

 





----

 

The characters involved are **Dick, Bruce, Kal’dur, and Jason (as robin)**. Since the first week deals with primarily a flash back we haven’t been introduced to Jason as The Red Hood nor has he died yet.

 

Here is what Jason looks like: [Jason as Robin]( http://imgur.com/AGvC38w) courtesy of the show

 

And here is what Dick looks like: [Dick as Nightwing early days]( http://jasonh537.deviantart.com/art/Young-Justice-Nightwing-Discowing-Version-360162785) courtesy of /u/GoldandBlue

 

Now the reason why we chose to use Dick’s DiscoDick original Nightwing outfit is because we wanted to bring it into the show and since this flash back happens a month or so after Dick left the mantle of Robin he just wanted a sense of “freedom.”

 

You guys shouldn’t have to worry about any of this yet because **this week is just for the first chapter**

1364656483.0	1bayzf	Congratulations! You just got put in charge of the story ark for season three. How do you do it?	offdachain	15	5	18	"No limitations. You don't have to follow the things like season 3 will revolve around magic or any other limitations.

For me, it would start out slow. It will start with Nightwing doing some investigation solo because he left the team. It is on a new bank robber, Red Hood.

Slowly tensions rise through the season with filler episodes mostly about The Team, Nightwing, and Red Hood. But then something happens. Darkseid comes to Earth. But it isn't to concur it, it's to start a revolution. The revolt is about if Earth should start playing a bigger role in the rest of the Galaxy. But Darkseid isn't leading either sides, he is just egging them on and profiting from the new Civil War.

Heros and villains are split down the middle. The Team splits down the middle and forms two new teams. Slowly as tensions rise. We get more and more intense battles from both sides. We see fights like Artimas Vs Nightwing, Miss Martian Vs Superboy, Blue Beatle Vs. Impulse, Batman Vs Superman, etc.

But as tensions rise Darkseid's true intentions come into place. He wants the Earth to be split so he can lead a secretive envision. He wants to infiltrate the Earth, and make it seem like they destroyed themselves in the war. 

One of the teams is lead by Red Hood, the other is lead by Nightwing. As Darkseid's true intentions are revealed to the whole earth in a twist, he brings back the War World. Both teams send people in to deactivate it. Both Red Hood and Nightwing are going to the war world. As both new Justice Leagues (which include both villains and heroes) fight it out the war world starts to power up. Tension flys as the teams are trying to fight each other and the war world at the same time. As they are fighting, Dick and Jason get surrounded. They get an enemy of my enemy thing going and we see the most badasses fight ever. They work together perfectly. But then we hear a blaster go off pointed at Nightwing. It goes into slow motion. It shows a memory shown in the first episode of when they first met. Jason dives to protect Dick. The Red Hood has fallen.

It goes back to the Leagues fighting over the war in their last battle in the war. Soon, one side comes out on top, but neither side one. Through the season so many died on both sides. They then realize how self contained they were, the teams just saved the day. The crowds around the battle weren't cheering for them, they were cheering the war world was finally destroyed.

1364581783.0	1b98dh	A Problem in the Reason for the Reach Coming to Earth...	Deadspyder88	12	2	19	"I was thinking about reason for the Reach trying to harvest the meta-gene from humans, and it is said they went to Earth because of the six members of the Justice League attacking Rimbor.

The problem is almost none of the League members on trial were meta humans. 
Superman: Kryptonian (power from yellow sun)
Hawkgirl: Thangerian
Martian Manhunter: Martian
Hal Jordan: Green Lantern (power from ring, normal human otherwise)
Batman: Trained by League of Shadows and pushed himself to peek performance.
Wonder Woman: Demi-God/Amazon (This is the only one I can kind of see)

1364073048.0	1avn85	To you, what was Young Justice About?	TyTweeder	20	12	13	"I loved, loved, LOVED the first season. Everyone was given things to do, stories to complete and goals to accomplish.

Season 2 on the other hand was kind of wack to begin with. First off this is 5 years after the events of season one. Why? I just spent a season getting to know and care about a cast of, lets face it, relative nobodies. So this season introduces more nobodies and gets rid of some of the characters that I had grown to love from the first season. I think I can get over that, and I do until the ""hiatus"" in december. 

Every episode since the return in january has been awful. The characters have no consistant character traits and way too much time is spent with characters that are boring and by this late in the season are unimportant to the plot. 

These opinions being stated and now i'm left thinking that if the 5 year gap between seasons had been filled in some way. Be it a season of one off episodes with day to day teenage superhero situations which would lead into the events of season 2. Or what I was expecting to happen this season, which was flashbacks to see how the team got here.

I love, Miss martian, artemis, nightwing, kid flash, aqualad speedy and superboy. I love how they introduced Artemis and Zatanna as well. The whole season was near perfect with few miss steps. I just would have loved to see what got these characters from S1 to S2. 

To me Young Justice was a show about teenagers who happen to be superheros. It was about family, sacrifice and acceptance and living in the shadows of legends.

The Revenge of the Red Hood!	tlhInganHom	14	4	34	"Okay if anyone has any questions about how this works and what you guys will be doing please come over to [this thread for all your questions about the Community Comics project]( http://www.reddit.com/r/youngjustice/comments/1aubua/official_mod_post_the_ryoungjustice_community/) and lets keep this thread strictly for submissions for week one of the story.
 
 ----
 
Ok today is the day!!! As you all know today is the day the community takes the reigns of its own destiny! We all love young justice and don't want to see it disappear... You guys ready? ... I'm hype so without further ado... The mod team presents r/young justice community comics!!!
 
----
 
Just remember everyone we are not asking everyone to write an entire novel, or a paragraph or a story board, all we are asking is that people participate, talk to other users add suggestions add on to what others submit have a good time. At the end of this week I will read through all the comments and piece together the final draft of Week 1’s Story.
 
 ----

Okay guys and gals here's how it works we provide the start and ""finish” and you provide the meat, the middle, otherwise known as the important stuff. You tell your ideas let the community hear and also up vote what you like. Just so you know this starts the day after the season 2 finale.
 
The characters involved are **Dick, Bruce, Kal’dur, and Jason (as robin)**. Since the first week deals with primarily a flash back we haven’t been introduced to Jason as The Red Hood nor has he died yet.
 
Here is what Jason looks like: [Jason as Robin]( http://imgur.com/AGvC38w) courtesy of the show
 
And here is what Dick looks like: [Dick as Nightwing early days]( http://jasonh537.deviantart.com/art/Young-Justice-Nightwing-Discowing-Version-360162785) courtesy of /u/GoldandBlue
 
Now the reason why we chose to use Dick’s DiscoDick original Nightwing outfit is because we wanted to bring it into the show and since this flash back happens a month or so after Dick left the mantle of Robin he just wanted a sense of “freedom.”
 
You guys shouldn’t have to worry about any of this yet because **this week is just for the first chapter**
 
 ----

July 5th, Watchtower
 
Dick is looking at a holo of Jason he dozes off into a flash back,
 
it’s of his first time meeting Jason after becoming Nightwing.
 
**.... (this is what you fill in will fill in)** *what you guys want to hit on is Dick being unsure that of Jason since he is so “rough” and eventually accepting him*
----
 
At the end of the metaphorical day Dick now thinks of Jason as younger brother no matter how rough his edges are…
 
Suddenly, Dick snaps back to the present.
 
Kal'Dur asks what he is here since he is on a break
 
Dick mentions that he needs to speak to Bruce... Continued next story week.

1359904123.0	17t3yl	Could the Justice League movies take place in the Young Justice universe? 	UsagiTaicho	14	4	18	"Ignoring the very similar art styles (especially for Crisis on Two Earths, same artist), could the Justice League movies Crisis on Two Earths and Doom take place in the Young Justice universe? Here is my idea as long as nothing contradicts! me: CoTE takes place before the start of the series, before anyone got their sidekicks and certain members of the League joined it. Doom is a bit harder to fit in, since it only shows seven members, the main six and Cyborg, who isn't in the League yet in the show. Could it take place during season three, and Vandal Savage just ignores the other League members as pointless?

Immediately following the defeat of her boyfriend, we find Miss Martian in an unusual battle. There are going to be some important considerations for this battle, so read carefully.

--------

**Tourists... FROM BEYOND!**

*In this corner*: [Miss Martian](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Miss_Martian). I don't need to tell you who Miss Martian is. What I do need to say is that this is **pre-timeskip M'Gann**. That means no density shifting, no mind-wiping (irrelevant to this battle), and less control. Also, no Bio-Ship, although I think this goes without saying.

*In the other corner*: [Sphere](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Sphere). Arriving on Earth in a Boom Tube, this odd little ball is full of surprises. Technically speaking, Sphere is a living weapon created by the New Gods, so her offensive potentials are widely unknown, since we mostly see her acting as Superboy's vehicle.

--------

So this will be the last match of the first half. This tournament really is taking a while. I hope people stay interested. Perhaps some ideas for interesting Round 2 stuff? Especially because the show will be back on at that point.

So it's nearly New Years, and we are winding down the preliminaries. This week we see the entrance of, in my mind, the last of the favorites, Red Arrow. He's up against a relative unknown, but certainly not a wimp.

--------

**TITANS EAST!**

*In this corner*: [Red Arrow](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Arrow). Although actually a CADMUS-created clone of Roy Harper, the Red Arrow we have come to know is still a capable fighter. In this tournament, we will assume he is in pre-timeskip shape, as opposed to his gangly, post-timeskip shape. No one wants to see that.

*In the other corner*: [Garth](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Garth). In the Atlantis episode we see that Garth has been training under the Queen for years while Aqualad is out in the field. More importantly, we know that during the timeskip he became Tempest, a hero we know to be very powerful.

--------

So, assuming many of you watched Teen Titans, this is a fight you have already seen, since Speedy and Aqualad bickered when Teen Titans East was initially formed. So (hopefully) I will check in tomorrow about this time, but maybe not. We'll see.

**VOTING CLOSED**

In Teen Titans, we never got to see this resolved. Today we have decided that Red Arrow would prevail 34-10. I find this conclusion acceptable, since Red Arrow is my favorite character."	t5_2t3l1	True

1355796900.0	1511m8	Official Mod Post: Fan-Art Friday Resumes! Monthly themes!	Shiniholum	11	2	11	"Okay so I thought it would be a good idea to bring back fan-art friday. I feel like it was a great addition to this sub and it was always awesome to see what the community could create!

So here is how it works:

* Fan-Art Friday Starts on each friday of the week and extends to Saturday evening. (cant rush art ya know) 

* Back when we used to do it I spoke of prizes, I really really want to get those to those who submitted art,but there were unseen complications. so unfortunately for now its just for the community to do something.

* **THERE IS NO BAD ART, STICK FIGURES, MS PAINT, ACTUAL PAINTINGS, SKETCHES, FAN FICTIONS, COMIC STRIPS, RENDERS, CREATIONS IN MINECRAFT, IT DOESNT MATTER** The only think I ask of anyone submitting anything is that they sign with their reddit username (and their real one if they want) just so I can verify that it was you who submitted it.

----

New Changes:

* Monthly themes! Basically you can still draw what ever you want but there is the theme if you wish to observe it. For example for the remainder of this month we could have a Happy Holidays or Christmas Theme for the show!

* Fan art does not have to be exclusive to the show. Meaning if you want to submit a picture of Starfire, Cyborg, or Raven as part of the team or in any art there is nothing wrong with that!

----

So with that I look super forward to seeing what the community has to offer for this week!

On the batman universe website ^, they have both clips 1 &amp; 2 of the Darkest episode. In the second clip you see a character shoot Impulse with a net launcher type thing. There are also a few images beneath the clips. One image is that same character and Aqualad

Based on her appearance and impeccable aim in capturing Impulse, it is clear it is Artimis in her new disguise. 
I am so excited to see how this episode turns out. How everything is affecting Artimis. What happens to Blue Beetle, Impulse, and Lagoon Boy. And what is Aqualad going to have to do to further prove his loyalties to join the light. SO EXCITED. Would love to discuss what you guys think is going to happen?

1346399053.0	z4j6p	Friday night fights round 2: Nightwing VS. The Red Hood	YJRP_BlueBeetle	11	0	2	"I don’t think this will ever get old. The glow of Gotham at night feels so much brighter than it does at day. Jumping from rooftop to rooftop has always felt more natural than my old acrobatics in the circus. It’s gotten so busy with the team that I’ve barely been able to get out and when I do just running is the most calming thing I can do. Not running away just…running. But tonight it’s different. Tonight I’m running for a different reason.

Yesterday, a knife was stuck in the middle of a column in my apartment. A place and time were engraved into the hilt. Cooper training center, 9 pm. Cooper training center: the place I spent over a year working after becoming Nightwing. Who the hell could have done this? Who wants Dick Grayson dead? That’s what I aim to find out. So here I am, running along the tops of buildings I’ve grown to love. Soon I arrive, finding a skylight open that shouldn’t be open. I jump down, landing next to the boxing ring. I walk around, seeing where this mystery guy is.

“Well, the boy wonder DID turn up, how about that?” A voice called out from the rafters behind me. I spin around, taking out my ecrima sticks right as a man jumps down onto the training floor.

“Who are you and what do you want with Dick Grayson?” I ask to the man with the red helmet and black biker jacket. New scarecrow? One of jokers new goons?

“I’m hurt, really I am! I was sure you had read through the big old bats files.”
	“Never seen you before in my life.”
	“Oh wait, of course, the helmet. I forgot it looks different. You know what? I’m just going to tell you. The names red hood.”
	Red hood…No way! That was one of Bruces oldest enemies. But he died in that chemical plant years ago. 

“I’m not going to ask you again, hood. What do you want with Grayson?” 

“It’s red hood,” He growled “But dick, that’s not why I’m here! I’m here to test you, make sure you’re doing okay.”

I barely have time to think before he throws a knife straight towards my face. I dodge and I hear the knife make a loud THWAK in the wall behind me. He charges at me, pulling another knife from the sheathe on his hip. He slashes left and I block with one of my sticks. I push his arm away and jab with my elbow. He recoils about 5 feet, looking for his next opening. He kicks high, I block. He’s putting me on the defensive, that’s not good. I have to take control fast. Fortunately, he gives me an opening when he goes for a sweeping crack at my head. I jab once in his gut with my left, and a one-two in his face, followed by powerful kick to his midsection. His feet lift the ground and he flies back, landing on his shoulder. The pop from the dislocation echoes throughout the building. He gets up, and with another pop and a wince, he gets his shoulder back.
“Still as good as ever, Grayson. I thought you would have gotten soft in 3 years.”

Might as well drop any pretense of playing dumb “Who are you, red hood, and how do you know me?”

“Is it really that hard to figure out? Ah well, you’ll figure it out soon enough. But I must be on my way!”

“You expect me to just let you get away? You don’t know me at all.”

“Oh I know you won’t. Tell Bruce I’m gonna stick around. I’ll be watching. Oh and tell Tim to not ruin the name. Lots of memories wrapped up in there,” he says while dropping smoke pellets, masking his escape.

Jason.

1. **Batman the Brave and the Bold:** Dealt with the DC comic characters in a tongue and cheek manner, but still had serious episodes. Also it was another great ensemble show. Best version of Aquaman.

Sariel007	9	0	18	"In the premier of Young Justice when Superboy is underground he had a white costume that helped him absorb solar radiation. He immediately abandons this once he is free. Was the suit only needed since he was underground and therefore could not harvest the sun himself? (I seem to recall in the traditional Superman comics Superman's cells act as batteries that can store solar energy to fuel his powers).  In one comic he actually fights a vampire (Dracula I think) and when bitten the Vampire explodes since he is basically ingesting stored solar energy. 

So once Super Boy is above ground his cells can harvest the solar energy directly without the suit? Or maybe since Super Boy was only chronologically a couple of months old when they found him the suit was used to jump start his cells (i.e. accelerate the rate of charging since he is starting at zero charge).

=========

Way I see it, the Reach are massively out numbered. I get why the Justice League isn't going to the UN, but why aren't they communicating with U.S. military intelligence? Surely those paranoid folks would at least take the information. 

Why is the War World still in orbit? First of all, it's damaging to the Earth's environment. Second, why hasn't the League, I don't know, sent it hurling into the sun, or Jupiter, or something? 

Unless the Reach are able to boom tube in more forces, I don't see how they defeat the League. Captain Marvel alone should be able to handle the beetles. This is a guy strong enough to go toe to toe with Superman. They also have Dr. Fate, who can teleport them like into the sun. That's not to mention that Captain Atom, Blue Devil, Flash, and Aquaman are badasses. Flash is fast enough he could vibrate through a scarab and disable it. Mera and Zatanna are powerful magic users. Miss Martian is about as strong as her uncle. Speaking of, one of the beetles is a Martian. Anyone ever see *Justice League: New Horizons*? Batman to Martian Manhunter: ""I have a $1,000,000 sliver of radioactive meteorite for the one from Metropolis. For you all I need is a penny for a book of matches."" Green Beetle is out of commission from fire.  

Earth has two Green Lanterns besides Jon Stewart. Though the Guardians have a treaty with the Reach, it's unlikely that either Hal Jordan or Guy Gardner would adhere to such a rule. I also doubt a beetle is much of a match for a Green Lantern. 

I guess if the Reach somehow gets control of the War World, that's some trouble, but again, I don't get why it's even around. 

Will Earth villains side with the Reach? Perhaps not all of them. After all, it was Joker who killed Alexander Luthor, and in the series finale of Justice League Unlimited it was villains who fought side by side with the heroes. Manta has a small army. Would he rather fight for his son's life or for the Earth's destruction? Further, is the Light really aligned with the Reach, or are the Reach being used as well? It seems that the Light are really Earth villains, and I don't think that they'd be pleased with a Reach apocalypse. 

And then there's Sphere, who is captured. It's possible for her to reach out to the New Gods and call for back up. 

TL;DR... Unless there are some massive reinforcements called in, the Reach are overwhelmingly outnumbered.

Another shot for the Terror Twins comes right after Tommy's defeat. Also, while I'm here, I want to remind people that this isn't strictly a ""vote for your favorite character"" thing. I know Lagoon Boy is unpopular, but try to think about this in terms of a fight, not a popularity contest.

--------

**Deep Sea vs. Deep South**

*In this corner*: [Lagoon Boy](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Lagoon_Boy). When we first met Lagoon Boy, he was just the skinny fish guy that stole Superboy's girlfriend. Later that episode, we got to see his giant, derpy transformation. I for one think it's pretty cool.

*In the other corner*: [Tuppence Terror](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Tuppence_Terror). Not much to say about Tuppence that I didn't say about Tommy. Usually villainous pairs have a strong one and a smart one, but Tuppence and Tommy are both quick to anger and crazy strong. I guess she has longer hair, so there's that.

--------

So let's see how this goes. Sometimes I think I'm weird because I personally like Lagoon Boy a lot, but I know he's pretty unpopular. May the best man... wait, uh, person... no, um, humanoid being win!

Sorry about the lateness. I'm moving about a bit before the holiday, plus there was a small period of intense flu and The Hobbit. So it's been busy. Anyway, we find ourselves approaching the halfway mark of the Prelims.

--------

**Full Speed vs. Full Force**

*In this corner*: [Impulse](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Impulse). The boy from the future fills the speedster role in the new team, and in some ways, his powers exceed those of Kid Flash. We'll see if this round is ""pretty crash"" for Impulse.

*In the other corner*: [Tommy Terror](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Tommy_Terror). One of my personal favorite villians, Tommy Terror is the male half of the Terror Twins. Both him and his sister have super-strength, super-durability, and super-thick southern accents. Like all characters introduced in the first generation, we are assuming he is in his smaller, pre-timeskip shape.

--------

Not much to say here. Vote away, and hopefully I can manage to get the next one posted 24 hours from now. I'm pretty confident I will.

**VOTING CLOSED**

Finally we have a round with Aqualad. I'm not trying to tilt the results, but I see myself writing his name many more times in titles. That being said, he's not up against a nobody. Also, I'm still looking for suggestions to replace the Klarion and the Riddler.

--------

**Alpha-male Altercation**

*In this corner*: [Aqualad](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Aqualad). The de-facto leader of the first season team is a serious contender, in both senses of the word. Like the other generation 1 combatants, this is pre-timeskip Aqualad.

*In the other corner*: [Wolf](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Wolf). Like Mr. Tawny, Wolf was just a regular animal until the Kobra-Venom. Now he's huge, strong, and smart. After all, anyone Superboy would pick as a best friend has to be tough.

--------

So I'm thinking about accelerating the schedule. 36 hours is fine, but the votes are usually mostly in after 24. Plus the show is coming back faster than we thought, and I figure we won't need this diversion once it does. So voting closes in 30 hours, and then I'll change it to posting every night. There are 11 fights left in the prelims, and after that the matches get more interesting.

**EDIT** Oh god I was pretty tired when I posted this. Is there anyway to edit a title?

**VOTING FINALLY CLOSED**
I realize I'm like 24 hours late, but I got really sick really briefly. 44-8 is a big margin, but it's not surprising."	t5_2t3l1	True
1355357801.0	14r7sb	YJ Toh Prelims: Zatanna vs. MONQIs	ReluctantPirateGames	10	2	9	"**[Current Bracket](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuuCSQIOHy7mdENtQUxzMno4dFNXTG40aHhkOVFpakE)**

Due to some talk in the last post, and some lingering doubts I have had about a few of the combatants in this tournament, the bracket has changed slightly. The MONQIs have been moved up to this round until we can figure out someone to replace the Riddler. Also, if anyone has any great ideas for some new combatants, I am looking to replace the Riddler and probably Klarion. They are both outside the appropriate power level for this tournament, though in opposite ways.

---------

**Daughter of Fate vs. Sons of Ivo**

*In this corner*: [Zatanna](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Zatanna). In season 1, Zatanna was a late addition to the team, and her magical powers were underdeveloped. Still, she showed real promise in a handful of situations, and clearly she has stepped it up enough to join the Justice League during the timeskip. For this fight, we are assuming it is **pre-timeskip Zatanna**.

*In the other corner*: [Six MONQIs](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/MONQI). Although fairly weak as individuals, a squad of MONQIs can do some real damage, even to the likes of Dick Grayson and Superboy. More importantly, their name stands for ""Mobile Optimal Neural Quotient Infiltrators,"" which is awesome. They would totally win a name tournament.

--------

Just to reinforce this, the fight is between pre-timeskip Zatanna and a squad of six MONQIs. Oddly enough, I think this would make the best animated fights of the ones that we have voted on so far. As always, voting closes in 36 hours, so Friday morning.

**VOTING CLOSED**

I'm a little late on this, but The Hobbit was long and I just woke up. Either way, another landslide, this time 42-5 for Zatanna. Next post!"	t5_2t3l1	True

**DISCUSSION:**

With the show coming back let us discuss something we want to see in it. But lets stray away from big stuff like new characters (Jason), or storys or whatever, instead let us discuss what one **MINOR** thing that we want to see in the show. Ill start, I really, really want to see more bat-family interaction, I mean its so good whenever they are together. But im not asking for a Bat-Family heavy episode (although one of those would be greatly appreciated) just some more interactions between them throughout the show. How about all of you?"	t5_2t3l1	True
1345914004.0	yt8cg	Friday night fight round 1: Superboy VS. Lagoon Boy	YJRP_BlueBeetle	11	3	10	"“B-Zero four. Superboy,” the metallic voice of the mt. justice computer rings through the cave. I walk through the tube into the open cavern. “Hello? Anypony here?” I call out. There’s always somepony around. Usually it’s Nightwing or Impulse but I don’t see them. I just hope I don’t have to deal with m’gaan or that idiot lagoo- “Well well if it isn’t Superboy.” Horseapples. “Is there anypony else here?” I ask, turning to the smug Atlantean. “I’m afraid not. Beast Colt dragged Nightwing, Bumblebee, and Batgirl off to something called pizza” “I think I’ll go and find them.” I have no reason to stay around here. I just need to get out of here quickly. “Not so fast. I actually need a sparring partner and you’re the perfect one for this,” He says. He thinks he can take me. Cute. “I really don’t think you want to fight me, La'gaan.” I say as I turn back towards the tube. “Alright, have it your way. I wouldn’t want to fight a coward.” That strikes a nerve. I stop mid stride and sigh. I can hear his heartbeat speeding up ever so slightly. I turn and walk up to him “You’ve got yourself a dancing partner.”

The hum from the sparring arena reverberates through the caves walls. It’s reminding me of all the sessions with Black Canary and Aqualad. Kaldur would be calm. He wouldn’t be aching to pummel this kid. Get it together Conner, you can’t think about that right now. 
“I’ve always wondered how we matched up, you know. I have no doubts we’re equals but now I want to see for myself.” He says, with a stupid grin on his face. The light from the floor is making the top of his head covered in shadows. All I’m seeing is that damn grin. Guess it’s time to wipe it off. 

I jab right, he blocks with his left arm while his right goes towards my gut. I sidestep, grab his wrist and throw him to the opposite edge of the arena. He lands on his back and the computer immediately registers it with a “Lagoon colt status: fail” I turn to walk away.
“Don’t turn your back on me!” La'gaan cries out as he gets up and rushes at me. I decide to sidestep but then I hear a boom. I turn around and there he is. A giant bulked out version of himself, flying towards me. I don’t know why it’s surprising me but that thought is brushed aside as he lands on me. The air is knocked from my lungs and he is just wailing on me, barely giving me an inch. But that is his mistake, no one should give me any room to counter. I knee him in the back, giving me enough room to flip him in the air and punch him in the back just hard enough to send him skidding across the ground and into a wall. I stand up and notice that I’m actually bleeding from my nose and lip. “He’s tough, I’ll give him that” I think to myself.

I walk over to him and offer him my hoof. He’s looking at me and I don’t even need super senses to see the anger coming from him. He bats it away. “I don’t need your help,” He growls at me as he stands. I know when I’m not wanted. “Patch yourself up.” I walked away and through the tube. The metallic voice was still ringing in my ears as I disappeared. B-Zero Four: Supoerboy."	t5_2t3l1	True

The updates I've made are the following:

* New Search bar, powered by Robin's hacking software! :p
* New colored ""YOUNG JUSTICE INVASION"" Logo on the background
* New graphic titles for the different sections of the sidebar
* Finally the ""YOUNG JUSTICE"" Logo on the header links back to the main page of the sub, and not to the front page of reddit (Big shout out  to /u/gavin19 and /u/Corgana from /r/startrek for helping with the coding)
* And of course, as you might have noticed, all the flair has been updated and * Drum Roll * NEW Flair has been added. Be sure to check them out; The new ones are : *Nightwing, Batgirl, Blue Beetle, Wonder Girl and Wolf*

I'm going to need some input with the members of the team that don't have an emblem (Beastboy, Bumblebee, Lagoon Boy, etc) so if you guys have any ideas please let me know in the comments.

I hope you all like this update and be sure to let me know if you find some kind of bug or something not working properly. Thank you!

I realize this is getting silly, but again we find a Bat-kid in a fight for survival. I totally did not mean to do this, but this is how a seeded bracket is structured, and that's how I rated them. Anyway, because of Shimmer's new powers, and our lack of knowledge about them, this discussion should be interesting.

--------

**The Youngest Child vs the Wild Child**

*In this corner*: [Tim Drake](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Robin). The new Robin brings his own style to the job. Sure he doesn't have the mad acrobatic skills of his living predecessor, but, if the comics are to be believed, he might be the smartest of the three boys who have donned the costume.

*In the other corner*: [Shimmer](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Shimmer). Until recently, Shimmer was just a cultist with a bad attitude and an even badder older brother (Mammoth). But after the Reach had their way with her genetic code, she has developed, though not perfected, the power to melt things that she touches. We can assume that she is highly dangerous in close quarters.

--------

Just a reminder, upvotes are counted on my official voting comments, and I will count them 36 hours from when this was posted, so late Wednesday night. Discuss!

**VOTING CLOSED**

With an overwhelming vote of 35-6, the new Robin puts Shimmer out of commission. Now to determine his next opponent..."	t5_2t3l1	True
1355106859.0	14kxch	YJ ToH Prelims: Batgirl vs. Rocket	ReluctantPirateGames	12	4	46	"**[Current Bracket](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuuCSQIOHy7mdENtQUxzMno4dFNXTG40aHhkOVFpakE)**

Round 2 of the Tournament brings us a very even, and very interesting matchup. Again, I will post two comments, and you will vote with upvotes. Downvotes will not be counted. I'm sure this fight will result in a *lot* of discussion.

-------

**A Badass Belt-Based Brawl**

*In this corner*: [Batgirl](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Batgirl). As part of the second wave of Batman sidekicks, Barbara Gordon is equipped with all the gadgets and skills of her bat-peers.

*In the other corner*: [Rocket](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Rocket). Although we didn't get to see a lot of her in action, we know that her inertia belt is a ""force"" to be reckoned with. I will repeat this many times throughout of the tournament, but you should assume this is **pre-timeskip Rocket**, otherwise we have a full-fledged leaguer fighting a child.

-------

This battle should be really fun. I'm not saying it will change the results, but it would be cool to see some flash fiction (not the character, the style). Anyway, I'll come back and compile these results in about 36 hours, so Tuesday morning.

**VOTING CLOSED**

In a narrow victory, Rocket moves forward into the second level. For a while the votes were tied at 16-16, but someone came in and gave Rocket the vote she needed to win. I know this was contentious, but fear not, fans of Batgirl will notice that Rocket has to go up against the formidable Dick Grayson next time we see her. Perhaps revenge will be yours."	t5_2t3l1	True

In the past we have had Batman: The Animated Series, Superman: The Animated Series, The Justice League Series, Batman Beyond, The Batman, Teen Titans, Static Shock, full-fledged movies such as Under the Red Hood, Justice League: Doom, Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths but one of definitely the most spectacular is Young Justice. Young Justice if you aren’t aware is a tv cartoon adaptation of the comics, its fantastically scripted and animated, the characters are individual and they all stand out (you will love some like Impulse or hate some like Lagoon’Boy) but they are each amazing. 

One of the only draw backs to the show is the frequent hiatus’s the fans have to deal with but, for now, the show is returning to finish its second season!

This Saturday DC Nation returns to television with it comes the rest of the second season of Young Justice, Green Lantern the Animated Series, and the DC Nation shorts. 

So we from /r/youngjustice would like to invite anyone who might be interested or even already watching the show to join us this weekend at /r/youngjustice for the discussion of the show and even for people to sort of get accustomed to it just from the sub. 

----

Features that we have at /r/youngjustice:

* [Young Justice IRC Chat](http://centralchat.net/chat/YoungJusticeIRC). The IRC was implemented so that until the mods of the sub can get up the official discussion thread for the latest episode members of the community can discuss the episode.

* We have a wide selection of image flair that is always changing

* After the show returns we will probably have another text flair give away where I will post a self post saying that anyone that wants any titles has 4 (or so) hours to post and Ill give it to them.

* We have Fan Art Fridays where the community can submit any fan art at all whether it is a drawing, a painting, a story, a poem, you name it.

* We have our own [twitter feed](http://www.twitter.com/youngjusticesub) where people can check the status of the sub if there are any issues or anything, or check any news relating to the show and its related universes.

* Presence at Cons. This is something new we are trying with NYCC where we will have a presence at a con to report on all related news through our Twitter account. 

So please come on over to /r/youngjustice to enjoy the show with us!

Now here is the issue we will have to set up a schedule and deadlines to push chapters out. Art can collaborate with the writers but for the most part they have to pull through what the writers put down. Now the final big issue, there is no pay, trust me I would love to pay every single one of you but well that aint happening.

So -- in the five year gap there are 3 incarnations of Robin. Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, then on to Tim.

How? In the series one, I think it's said that Robin is 13-14, after the time jump he's become Nightwing, and should be around 18-19 years old.

At what point would he have become Nightwing, to give Jason Todd some ample time as the next Robin? Let's assume he became Nightwing around 17. That gives Todd what, a year before he's killed? And he'd still need time to be trained as Robin before being put out into the field. And it doesn't seem like that is possible, considering that Grayson is still under the Robin mantle. 

And then season 2 already starts with Tim being an established member of the Team - with some mentoring by Dick. 

I guess it's all up for interpretation, but it just didn't seem like it would be enough time for A) Dick to take up the mantle of Nightwing, B) Have Jason be trained as Robin and inducted onto the Team, and C) Have Jason killed, Tim replace him, receive training as Robin, and then join the Team."	t5_2t3l1	True

Another day, another battle. Also, I don't think anyone reads this stuff. And why should they? I write the same thing every time. Probably because there isn't much to say. Text text words words, filler filler filler.

--------

**They blinded us... WITH SCIENCE**

*In this corner*: [Bumblebee](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Bumblebee). When we first met Karen, she was some random high-schooler. Now she's a big part of the wave of powerful female fighters that have joined the team. Her powers are derived from her suit, which she codesigned with Atom, and include flight, shrinking, and laser-ish blasts.

*In the other corner*: [Kid Flash](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Kid_Flash). Wally recreated his uncle's experiments, giving him similar, although not identical speedster abilities to the original Flash. He was a founding member of the team, and has since retired and gone to college. For this tournament, we are assuming he is in peak superhero shape, most likely pre-timeskip. After all, the ""Freshman 15"" would probably slow him down.

--------

So yeah, vote for a day. Or don't. Whatever. I've already filled out my own personal version of this bracket, and I can tell you that not all the fights have gone the way I would choose. But such is the nature of democracy. Is this democracy? Maybe. Probably not though.

**VOTING CLOSED**

Less votes overall this time, with Kid Flash winning 21-3. I think I might finish the first round and then put this on hold until the next hiatus (because we all know there will be one). Thoughts?"	t5_2t3l1	True

Alright! Getting somewhere now. I'm excited for this round because I really like the way they are handling Wonder Girl on the show, and I can't wait to see what everyone else thinks of her. Arsenal is the original version of my favorite character, Red Arrow, so I guess he's cool too. Whatever.

--------

**No sleeves vs. no arm**

*In this corner*:[Wonder Girl](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Wonder_Girl). This Amazonian (not sure about this actually) warrior brings some muscle to the second generation of the team. Although she can lose focus and she is not known for her subtlety, Wonder Girl is a threat to anyone in this tournament. Plus, unlike previous heavy hitters, she can fly.

*In the other corner*: [Arsenal](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Arsenal). This is a tough combatant to figure out. We haven't actually seen him in action yet, but we can assume that between his training, his robotic arm, and his frankly appropriate rage, he is not messing around. His intimidating name doesn't hurt either.

--------

I'm going to keep up this pace as long as I can, although I might skip Christmas. Also, do people like the fun titles I give the fights? I know some of them are a stretch, but I find myself compelled to do it after the first one worked so perfectly. Anyway, vote away!

Another tournament favorite enters the fray. This time it's the t-shirt wearing powerhouse known as Superboy. His first opponent is a relative unknown, but I wouldn't totally count her out. We'll see how you guys feel.

--------

**Heartbroken vs. Heartbreaker**

*In this corner*: [Superboy](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Superboy). The freeing of Superboy is how the team got it's start, and he has been irreplaceable since. Even though he lacks several of Superman's signature abilities (flight, laser vision), he is a titan on the team. In this tournament, he does not have Shields. That would be ridiculous.

*In the other corner*:[Tula](http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Tula). Kaldur's old flame was powerful enough to join the team during the timeskip. What we know about her is that while Kaldur left the academy to become Aqualad, Tula stayed behind to study with the queen of Atlantis, and is almost certainly a master of Atlantean Magic.

--------

This is another battle I would love to see animated, perhaps as some sort of sparring match in the cave. The Atlantean magic we saw on the show was amazing, and I'd love to see a more magic-focused figher, as opposed to the more simplistic style of Kaldur.

http://www.comixology.com/Young-Justice-2011-20/digital-comic/JUL120237

Thought this comic was really great.  I've bought a few other issues of the comicbook and came away feeling pretty lukewarm about most of them.  This one, though, has a number of really sweet moments.  Not to get too spoiler-y here, but all of Dick's scenes were gold, and seeing Connor and Megan's flashback was a treat.  Plus, the cliffhanger for the issue makes this feel like a much more ambitious comicbook than it was before (all of those were basically two-issue stories).  That only makes sense, since this is the lead-in to the Invasion storyline we're getting in the show.  And that's another strong point of the issue:  even though it's set just a month before the start of the show's timeline, it doesn't feel pointless.  I genuinely don't know what's going on with that cliffhanger.

I doubt Young Justice could do a storyline where Hal goes nuts and kills all the Green Lanterns. But they could just kill off Hal somehow and have the ring choose Kyle as a replacement and then John Stewart sticks him with the team while he's on earth. Kyle has been introduced in the DCAU before with a modified backstory so I think it could be interesting.

now if youve done that then hurry up and post so we all can discuss im sure we all would to see what you guys think. so ill go ahead and posy mine. also have any questions? feel free to ask me.



Day 1. How you found out about Young Justice?-i found out by promos hear say and me basically googleing(spelling?) all the info i could . the show sounded amazing on paper. and it looked beautiful too.

Day 2. thoughts on the season 2.5 trailer recently released.- man it was epic! Static, deathstroke and so many other themes that will take a toll on the characters. It is set up to be amazing.... Ima go watch it again. 

Day 3. Favorite villain and why?-honestly ill go with black manta. he seems like he is gonna play a bigger role in coming episodes. he is intelligent,has an army at his disposal,aqualads dad,and he just joined the light. he will be a force to be reckoned with.

Day 4. Least favorite villain and why?- i never really cared for ultra-humanite,just seemed so bland and never really stuck out.plus with gorillia grodd kinda idk redundant. (correct me if im wrong) 

Day 5. Favorite male character and why?- that would have to be Aqualad for a few simple reasons, he is humble,loyal(to the extent of taken one for the team and going undercover), a good leader, very perceptive, has unique and useful weapons and is just an all around bad ass. 

Day 6. Favorite female character and why?-rocket;for many reasons explained [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/youngjustice/comments/tiyk0/my_fellow_redditors_gather_around_boys_and_girls/)

Day 7. Least favorite character and why?-lagoon boy. honestly seemed like an asshole. not the lovable woleverine asshole the annoying water based bad catchphrase having  asshole.

Day 8. Best mentor and why?(EX. Aquaman, Superman, Batman, Martian Manhunter,Icon etc.) favorite mentor icon but best would have to be well batman. he atleast somewhat respects the teams space.hes not overbearing he  lets them figure things out on their own.which is sometimes what  kids need. plus he's fucking batman.

Day 9. Worst mentor and why?(EX. Aquaman, Superman, Batman (LOLOLBATMAN), Martian Manhunter Icon etc.) none are bad perse just not as good as others. i vote for aquaman. nothing person just wish he would have been honest with aqualad.but overall i guess he's a pretty good mentor.

Day 10. Best friendship and why? gotta god with the friendship between wally and dick.they seem to know alot about each others past, act like best friends,have secrets,and just seem to have real good chemistry. all that equals to a great friendship.

Day 11. Superpower/skill you’d want and why? i would to have a powerset like [Idie Okonkwo aka Oya](http://worldofblackheroes.com/2010/10/06/idie-okonkwo-oya/) Idie is a high level thermo-kinetic mutant able to generate both heat and cold from her body. Not only can she generate Ice and fire but also control their shape and intensity she is also immune to temperature extremes. that just screames bad ass. look [here](http://worldofblackheroes.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/oya7.jpg), [here](http://worldofblackheroes.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/oya6.jpg), [here](http://worldofblackheroes.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/oya1.jpg).

Day 12. Favorite ship and why? id have to  say wally and artemis. it was just a long time coming. through out season 1 they really teased it and it warmed up to me. plus i think artemis will straighten wally out.

Day 13. Least favorite ship and why? lagoon boy and megan. honestly lagoon boy is a douche.

Day 14. Favorite from the Justice League team and why? icon.he's black, super intelligent,a ace lawyer, alien who crash landed in the southern usa circa 1839 and lived thtough slavery harlem Renaissance great depression and so many other historical events. and he can go toe to toe with superman need i say more?

Day 15. Least favorite from the Justice League team and why? hmm honestly i didnt really dislike anyone.

Day 16. Robin or Aqualad as leader and why? aqualad because even though he wasnt groomed to be leader since age 9(robin) he is very capable of making sure the mission gets done.

Day 17. Favorite quote ""youre overwhelmed freeze was underwhelmed what isnt anyone just whelmed?"" -robin

Day 18. Favorite Superboy/Miss Martian moment-when superboy accepted her appearance even though she was really scared of the reaction. i found it really touching.

Day 19. Funniest moment-i remember when Artemis made some jokes about alomst drowing like twice that was pretty funny.

Day 20. A mentor and protege you’d want to spend the day with and why?robin and batman. because hes fuckin batman. and just spending time with them would teach alot to anybody.

Day 21. Favourite “Red” tornado hands down. but firebrand was pretty cool.

Day 22. Favorite episode and why? the episode where all the adults disappear. great episode that took place on my birthday! nov 5th.

Day 23. Favorite mentor/protoge relationship and why?i really like batman and robins relationship. its really unique. bruce cheered robin up by playing basketball with him. among other things. its just really really cool.

Day 24. Thoughts on episode 207 ""Depths"" its a great set-up for whats to come.and i love the twist at the end.

Day 25. Who you want to see more of on the show. rocket hands down!

Day 26. Explain your thoughts about the show in general-i feel its  a very diverse and unique show that shows great stories, underused characters get a chance to shine,the art is amazing, its funny and just all around amazing. something tv needs.

Day 27. Are you a villain or a superhero and why. probably a villain. because powers corrupt everybody. and im only human. plus i could chill all day no need to rush out at all hours of the day like heroes. ill be sensible lol

Day 28. Any character you’d want to be- mos def Aqualad. the triple C Kal'dur who leads the team, makes a selfless sacrifice to join his dad for the greater good and who has a really cool weapon...yeah deffiently(sp?)  him.  

Day 29. Any changes you’d make to the show-

* make it an hour long. this way we can have more character developent,wont have great characters being useless for no reason, more time to develop  the overall universe maybe take the time to really make the animation unique and distinctive.(even though it looks great).


* honestly i  cant really think of anything else. well maybe more milestone.thats just me.

Day 30. Who you’d add to the show-wow man i could write a moutain about this. i'd only add characters if they actually get used to their potential that being said [heres](http://www.reddit.com/r/youngjustice/comments/ugqmd/if_you_could_add_one_member_to_the_team_who_would/) my answer.

1321304976.0	mc77c	M'gann M'orzz and the state of Mars	Little_Sally_Digby	7	1	13	"So, if you read Teen Titans around 1YL or wiki'd her or anything like that, you know that in pre-Flashpoint New Earth she was a White Martian masquerading as a Green one using her shapeshifting. Same powers, but totally different background: White Martians are an aggressive, warlike race unaffected by Hronmeer's Curse (the plague that wiped out the Greens aside from J'onn) and have menaced Earth on multiple occasions.

In Young Justice so far, however, M'gann has said that she's J'onn's niece (her introduction), she has twelve sisters on Mars (Artemis's introduction), and the White Martians do exist and have a deep racial conflict with the Greens (Targets). On the latter occasion, she explains the conflict between the races first, portrayed the Whites as a persecuted underclass, referred to neither color as ""we"" or ""us"", and then hurriedly tacked on a statement to the effect of ""I'm Green, but it's still terrible."" In the latest episode (Disordered), she was disturbed when Black Canary told her she'd turned white, and relieved to see that she had in fact changed to her usual human-disguised form, which is Caucasian.

In J'onn's appearances, even the one in Failsafe where he discussed M'gann at length, he has never mentioned the two races of Mars, H'ronmeer's Curse, or any other family members.

So... is this a legitimate difference between Earth-16 and New Earth, or a reveal the writers are waiting for later to spring on us (maybe during Invasion)? 

If what she's said about Mars is all true, including referring to her sisters and the widespread conflict in the present tense) that pretty much implies that there hasn't *been* any plague on Mars, and therefore that Earth's next-door neighbor in planetary terms has harbored two different sentient races for the span of human history, which I think is a pretty huge divergence from normal New Earth continuity- not to mention, you know, *human history.* here might actually *be* visible canals on Mars in this universe. 

Also, if we look at what we know about J'onn's family tree from before the plague... his only known sibling is Malefa'ak, notable villain, Martian mutant  and *architect* of Hronmeer's Curse. If the writers don't want M'gann to be someone who lied to her friends, even just to be accepted despite her heritage, then the introduction of her father as a bad guy would still be a similarly-sized bombshell.

On the other hand, if M'gann is a White Martian, then the question of whether Hronmeer's Curse ever happened in this universe is still up in the air. So... two main questions, and one subquestion:

1) Is there a sizable Green Martian population in this universe at present?

**Edit: Yes. Greg Weisman says and tie-in comic issue 6 confirms, M'gann has a happy healthy humongous family tree, and J'onn had a competition for the role when he went back to Mars to recruit a protégé. He's not stealing Superman's last son schtick here; Mars is alive and well. Which brings us to a new question...**

1a) What does human history look like if there's a thriving race of telepaths on the next world over?

2) Is M'gann actually J'onn's niece, a White Martian pretending to be green, or all of the above? She could be adopted, after all, and even if there's some deception here, the fact that he corroborates her story means that either he believes it (he does regard her as family by either adoption or some other bond) or he's decided to help her conduct said deception.

**Edit: According to info from tie-in comic issue 6 on the YJ wiki,**

&gt;  M'gann entered, and was determined to win, though her uncle was not fond of the idea. When she did win, Martian Manhunter kept his word, and brought her to Earth.

**This means that J'onn considered her his niece before she became his protégé. So if there is deception as to their relationship, it runs** *deep,* **and J'onn's not in on it. No word on her race, though.**

2a) If M'gann is J'onn's niece- is Malefa'ak her dad?

Edit: The confirmed lack of Hronmeer's Curse in this universe so far sharply decreases Malefa'ak's importance as a character. Still, it might be coming... and even if not, it'd be very interesting to find out that M'gann's incredible telepathic mind is the offspring of a Martian freak with no telepathy of his own."	t5_2t3l1	True

Now here is the issue we will have to set up a schedule and deadlines to push drafts for chapters out. Writers will create the stories to the approved storyboarded by the mods and editors. There will also be some community involvement in regards to what stories we tell. Now the final big issue, there is no pay, trust me I would love to pay every single one of you but well that aint happening.

Forgive me if they have been gone over before...but I just wanted to do something. 
 
People have mentioned buying the toys which is good, but buying the Young Justice DVDs and buying Young Justice: Legacy when it comes out might also have a good impact. 
If I'm not mistaken, didn't DVD sales help the Firefly fans get the Serenity movie made?

Another thing that's not really ""mainstream"" is visualization.
