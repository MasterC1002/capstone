1360220999.0	181y24	People from AskReddit: Welcome! Now sit the fuck down and pay some attention.	Durchii	346	40	47	"All right, children, let's all gather 'round.

You have stumbled upon a powerful and tremendous force, the likes of which hide deep within the bowels of Reddit for one very simple reason: if you put too much pressure on one side of this lengthy airship of greatness, a modern testament to the sheer will and beauty of all human imagining, then the whole god-damned thing spirals right the fuck out of control and we all fucking die.

The shower beer, as some of you are now coming to realize, is one of the finer pleasures in this life, and one which I firmly believe all men and women worth their salt should indulge in on a daily basis. Multiple times per day, if utilities are cheap in your area. If they're not, feel free to bathe in cheaper beer - none of us will look down on you for it, and that might make for a pretty interesting submission.

From $12 bombers to $1.25 forties, this sub has seen it all, and will continue to do so for a very long time.

*How-the-fuck-ever...* always remember what this place is called. 

This is **SHOWER.** **BEER.**

For the slow of wit, this means that the water should be dispensed from your plumbing at, or above, eye level and the beverage should be a carbonated, alcoholic concoction ranging anywhere from 4% to 18% alcohol by volume and contain any combination of hops, malts, and glorious yeasty byproducts. Styles may vary of course, and I believe we've come to the consensus that Ciders are perfectly all right.

If the bottle in your hand says Chardonnay, Islay, Rose', or Tanqueray, then take it the fuck *a*way.

Also, we're very proud that you have a bath tub and flawless toenails, but /r/bathbeer exists for a reason. They'll love you over there. 

Don't get me wrong, we love you too! But in the same sense that John Wayne Gacy loved his children: beaten, strangled, and buried in a crawl space underneath his house.

Also, we're very happy that you are a regular GoneWild contributor who has a flawlessly bleached asshole, but unless you've managed to find a way to hold the tip of a beer bottle using just your rectum so that the label can still be clearly read, this may not be the place for it. 

Forward your bleached asshole to my inbox and I'll write you a beautiful haiku about it, but post it on this sub and people start to get testy.

All right, beer drinkers, that's your quick primer to /r/showerbeer. 

Men, women, and hermaphroditic party clowns alike: **DRINK, BATHE, AND BE MERRY. THEN COME TELL US ABOUT IT.**"	t5_2t7u5	True

I know a lot of ya'll are reddit-wowed by the concept of a showerbeer. I know you want to share this newfound experience with the world.

That being said: For your first time, just for for it. Forget the picture. There is *plenty* of time to make photographic evidence of your amazing testimony to living the good life.

Your first shower beer man... Just **go for it**.

Oh yeah.

* Do what you feel.

* Steam all heated up, hot water blasting you right in the face, that cold cold beer streaming down your throat...

* Sit down. Let it beat on your head while you booze it up. *Think* about shit.

* Do your shampoo anime hair and sing a rock and roll song.

* Pour some ice cold beer down all over your body!

* Pretend you are in a dubstep video.

* Or whatever you are into.


I love you all.

Recently, as an adult, I got in shape, and even ran my first marathon. As a celebration for getting my masters and getting in shape, I climbed Kilimanjaro, the tallest mountain in Africa, with my dad. It was 7 days of grueling hikes and climbs, drinking shit-inducing water, eating boiled dehydrated vegetables, and smelling like a dead tooth. 

Upon arriving back in Moshi town, all I could think about was a shower. I left all my gear on the floor of my room, ordered two 1.5 pt Tuskers from the bellhop, and took a 45 minute, glorious, ungodly good shower, while getting shitfaced on delicious lager.
