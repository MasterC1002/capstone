Like it or not, one of the major factors in maintaining the importance
of medieval studies to the modern world has been the study of late-
medieval war and research concerning its honored but sometimes
uncontrollable child, chivalry. One of the unfortunate offshoots of
this popularity has been a basic misunderstanding of the medieval
martial ethic by those who unabashedly serve the code of creative
anachronism and by an ill-informed general public that looks on
medieval warfare as a mild game always conducted according to
gentlemanly rules. To offset these misconceptions that have more in
common with the theme park's view of history than any realistic
historical record, Steven Muhlberger sets out in this book to explain
the context of the organized combats that were firmly tied to the
realm of warfare, but eventually found a life of its own within the
orbit of the tournament. To carry out this ambitious project, he
struggles to demonstrate that these bloody exchanges existed within an
evolving code of chivalry that attempted to establish at least a
modicum of order for battlefield and jousting ground alike.

The focus of this work--the late-fourteenth century--is largely
directed toward the era of the Hundred Years War (1337-1453). It is
built on the extensive use of the primary sources of the period (many
of which have been translated into English in the last century). These
include the chronicles of Jean Froissart, Jean Le Bel, Gutierre Diaz
de Gomez, Christine de Pizan, and Thomas Walsingham as well as
document collections associated with great chivalric figures as Edward
the Black Prince, Geoffrey de Charny, and Jean II le Meingre
(Boucicaut the younger). Muhlberger's initial direction with the use
of these sources is to demonstrate that the deeds of arms were firmly
connected to the brutal realities of medieval warfare, but also
personified humanizing theories such as just war that the mediator of
medieval society, the Church, had itself attempted to impose on human
conflict. By a minute study of both individual and group combat
sparking into existence inside and outside organized military
campaigns, Muhlberger shows that such contests were every bit as
dangerous as the melée that inundated the battlefield. He also reviews
the quite meticulous rules set up for fairness and the maintenance of
personal honor that came into being for the regulation of such
combats. From his extensive reading of the sources, Muhlberger
concludes that the evolving codes of martial rules did not come from
the jousting arena, but sprang from the impromptu conflicts carried
out by small groups of combatants serving in campaigns of much larger
armies. From this ever-shifting environment came both the regulations
and the larger-than-life heroes who were judged by them.

Much of the remainder of Muhlbereger's book centers on how the
emerging ""industry"" of individual and group conflicts were carried out
between French, English, Spanish, and Flemish participants. He follows
in great detail the challenge, the conduct of the resulting fight, and
the means by which fair play was supposed to prevent such conflicts
from lapsing into vendettas pure and simple. The highlight of this
discussion is Muhlberger's meticulous review of the Combat of Thirty
Against Thirty, a conflict of French and British knights in Brittany
during 1351. This encounter occurring in a backwater of the Hundred
Years War seemed to stir the imagination of European authors for next
few decades who viewed the small skirmish as a halfway-house of sorts
between the bloodiest aspects of actual warfare and the humane rules
of the tournament. From his discussion of this crucially important
incident of group conflict, Muhlberger moves to trace the influence of
such fighting on fourteenth-century societies. With the great interest
that deeds of arms caused, the chivalric fighter and the painful duty
of honor he swore to uphold became a regular topos in chronicles and
romances down to the sixteenth century. This chivalric imprint on
late-medieval society shaped reality--at least among upper-class
circles--when kings tied tournaments to marriage celebrations and
other episodes of high-level negotiation. The most important of these
public combats occurred in 1390 at St. Inglevert near Calais when
three French knights challenged and bested all comers from the ranks
of the English invaders. Though originally a private enterprise, the
St. Inglevert jousts became a source of French pride and established
the model for ""national tournaments"" down to the sixteenth century.
These popular chivalric norms that eventually became anachronistic in
the face of European warfare increasingly marked by the use of
gunpowder weaponry provided lucrative careers both on the tournament
circuit and in royal service to many a fourteenth-century warrior.
Muhlberger discusses these super-stars in his last chapter.

In all of his chapters, Muhlberger follows the well-trod path of
chivalric authors led by Jean Froissart. The inclusion of large
passages from their works in English translation (a feat which
Muhlberger has already duplicated online) is helpful to the general
reader as well as to the military and social historians whose study
focuses on the later Middle Ages. Muhlberger's greatest contribution
in this work, however, is the skillful inclusion of the realm of
&lt;i&gt;faits d'armes&lt;/i&gt; into a military spectrum that effectively
stretched from the tournament to the battlefield. In some ways, then,
Muhlberger deserves to be placed in the company of the greatest modern
expert on individual and group combat of the later Middle Ages, Sydney

Please keep the books mostly about **Europeans, Vikings, Scots, and the like** because I do not want anything about the more Eastern countries or Japan.

I'm a first year English Graduate student who is focusing her MA and PhD in the area of Medieval literature.  Starting this semester, I realized that I had not hard a comprehensive history course on this time frame of history; in fact, most of it, when in high school, was greatly glossed over.  I was wondering if any history buffs could recommend an easy-to-read, enjoyable, comprehensive book that goes through the history of the Anglo-Saxon period in Europe through, perhaps, the beginning of the Renaissance?  This is a huge portion of history, I know, but I think it might help me formulate a better base for understanding the literature I'm currently reading.

1369316949.0	1ewi34	Looking to recreate medieval warfare for a civ mod based on the ASoIaF series (game of thrones), figured this would be the place to ask	jokul	9	3	4	"Hi, I'm building a mod for civilization 4 that is based on ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" by George R.R. Martin / Game of Thrones t.v. series on HBO.  Warfare in the book/tv show is (to the best of my knowledge) an amalgamation of warfare tactics throughout the middle ages.  The combat system would be fairly simple: units hit each other for damage that is reduced by armor until their health reaches zero.  Units can also have first strikes which should indicate the ability to attack suddenly or to indicate a range advantage.  To recreate this style of warfare (but keeping the game fairly simple), I have limited myself to the following units with these roles; my explanations (no matter how inaccurate) are in parenthesis afterwards:

Infantry
---
* Swordsman - Strong against other infantry and ranged units.  Weak vs. cavalry.  (my research has indicated that the sword is a very flexible and lightweight dueling weapon)
* Axemen - Deals additional damage based on the enemy's health (I have no justification for this, but I need this type of mechanic)
* Maceman - Ignores enemy armor (maces as blunt weapons were more reliant on crushing power and blunt force  trauma, which armor is less effective against)
* Spearman - Higher defense anti-cavalry unit (they can carry a shield in their off-hand)
* Pikeman - Lower defense anti-cavalry unit, more effective than spear but more specialized (virtually every game on the planet has done this to death)
* Halberdier - Medium bonus vs. cavalry, small bonus vs. other infantry (since it combines the spear end with an axe end)

Ranged
---
* Skirmisher - Deals damage to high health units, 2 first strikes, and retreats earlier than normal.  Basically good for softening up healthy units but not much else.  (this is, to the best of my knowledge, the role skirmishers have played historically)
* Archer - 2 first strikes, moderate statistics.  (just a generic ranged unit)
* Crossbow - 1 first strike, bonus vs. heavy units (heavy being explained later)

Cavalry
---
* Raider - Used for pillaging, strong against siege (in the event you had to fight, throw the torch at the enemy's wooden siege weapons)
* Light Cavalry - Bonus vs. ranged and light infantry (just my gut)
* Knight - Heavily armored cavalry unit.  Effectively a juggernaut.  Only truly beaten in efficiency (amount of effort put into making on vs. effort put into killing them).

Siege
---
* Ballista - Bonus vs. heavy units (a ballista generally wouldn't care how well protected you are and heavier targets would be slightly easier to hit)
* Catapult - Deals damage to multiple units (need a generic field weapon)
* Trebuchet - Reduces city defenses faster than other siege, large bonus when attacking cities (this is their purpose)
* Siege Tower - Ignores large portion of wall defense, huge attack bonus  when infantry on same tile.

---

In regards to heavy vs. light, all infantry are divided into heavy/light versions.  Light versions are cheaper to produce but heavy units are stronger.  Light units includes light cavalry and heavy units includes knights.  I know this is only a taste of medieval weaponry (falchions, flails, estocs, etc.) but players will be able to specialize their forces and these weapons would likely have a place in customization.  Now I know that this list is somewhat large, but do these mechanics more or less fit (within reason) the role these weapons played on medieval battlefields?  Thanks for any help with this!"	t5_2sa8g	True

1354545272.0	1478yv	Family ancestry and personal choice of weapon, please share	specieshumanoid	19	19	14	"I spent a few years patching together a genealogical list tracing my family name, and was able to go all the way back to 950a.d. before I couldn't go any further.

 I then sent my findings to the Greenwich Library of England so they could verify what I found AND THEY SAID THAT IT WAS ALL CORRECT!! And it was also verified that a number of our ancestors were Lords, many were Knights, and a crap ton were Military Archers. 

What is also interesting is that my ancestors were famous for being archers, and me and my family YEARS before we knew any of this were into archery. My dad has also won a competition in it. I believe it's in the blood, when a family line has done a certain thing for so long I believe it gets imprinted on the family. My brothers and I were all into archery, swords, and also train in the martial arts, yeah it's in the blood lol

the link to Greenwich library http://www.greenwichlibrary.org/Research%20and%20Resources/LocalHistory.aspx they're one specialty is genealogical research, so they were able to even help me piece some other questions. Our family is mentioned in the Doomsday Book (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book), and is even found in records preceding it.

As for weapons, I practice mastering the European Bastard Sword,

1335319264.0	sr1du	Church Title/Order Clarification - O.S.D. [xpost from r/Christianity]	MalSponseller	2	2	2	"Hey guys. I'm in the process of writing a paper on *Piers Plowman* and am looking into the influence of the Tree of Wisdom and the Tower of Wisdom on Dame Studie and her perception of learning and knowledge. Researching the Tower of Wisdom, I've come across the supposed creator of the diagram in 1272: Franciscus Bonacursus O.S.D.

My question is, what does the O.S.D. stand for? It seems to be a title from the context, but Google and Wikipedia searches have turned up nothing. Does anyone know the meaning behind the title; what it stands for? I'm simply on the fence as to whether I should include it in my paper or not, and as I'm presenting my rough draft in a few days to my class and professor, if I've added it and they question me on it, I don't want to have to respond with a weak, ""I don't know.""

Any clarification would help, thank you!


EDIT: Since my original posting in r/Christianity, it seems the abbreviation may have connections with the Order of Saint Dominic, though during Bonacursus' time it would have gone by a Latin name abbreviated as O.P. not O.S.D.  Does this help at all?"	t5_2sa8g	True

My brother insists it's called a ""battleflick"", but Google says no such thing exists.

It's wooden-handled and two-handed. Blade is, from top to bottom, about the size of an adult male hand (namely mine) and thin. It's on the heavy side, so I'd guess that the blade is iron.

Any medieval weapon experts out there know what this axe thingy is called?"	t5_2sa8g	True
