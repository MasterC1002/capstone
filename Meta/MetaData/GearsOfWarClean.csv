1365728164.0	1c6beo	Judgements Multiplayer sucks. There, I said it.	Corndogmarr	180	68	205	"Let me apologize in advance for typos, I'm typing this on my phone.
Now let me take the time to explain why I absolutely despise this game.

Campaign: While the actual gameplay of the campaign was fun, the story sucked shit through a straw. The character are shallower than a puddle of water in the Sahara desert. By the end of the campaign, I still did not give a flying fuck if Sophia died. I learned more about her reading the little description about her on the character selection screen. Cole probably has maybe 10 lines throughout the entire game. Baird was kind of just there to describe what you were doing. The only character that stood out was Paduk and he still didn't even amount to one tenth of the depth any characters in the original trilogies had. 

Moving on to multiplayer...
Jesus H. Christ I could sit here for hours complaining about this but ill try to keep it as short as possible. 

Weapon Loadouts: I think Epic was doing this to try to diversify the Loadouts and make people collaborate roles. Well that fucking backfired. This addition only narrowed it down even further. In your average game of TDM you will maybe see 1 or 2 people using anything other than the gnasher and about halfway through the game they get fed up and either quit or start using the gnasher because there is almost no way to do good if you don't use it. The sawed off is absolutely useless now. Why use it when it is basically a gnasher with 1/4th of the clip. The hammerburst, originally designed to be a longer ranged rifle, now has more recoil than the fucking Vulcan machine gun. Hell the damn snub is more effective at killing than the hammerburst is.

Melee: Need I say more?

Verticality: This could have been a wonderful addition to the series if they didn't shit the bed in map design. Instead of simply adding in the feature, they based almost every map design on it. Gondola is the most frustrating map I have ever played in my entire life. I'm almost for certain they made it just to showcase the jumping off ledges feature and nothing else. 

Map Design: Simply put. It sucks dick. Spawn points are beyond imbalanced. Lack of symmetry eliminates any tactical gameplay from the game. I swear upon my soul I have not deaths from behind than I have in all the other gear games combined. 

Grenades: ""Well you spawn with grenades in Call of Duty, so why don't we put that in Gears?"" I still have no clue is to why they made this design decision. The LB button has basically turned into a panic switch that you press whenever you so much as get looked at. Stim Grenades are especially annoying. Let me throw my invincibility mist at the ground anytime I so much as get breathed on. Oh you're shooting me with a Vulcan? Nah bro I'm fine I've got my mist. 

No Locust in Multiplayer: Don't know why they didn't include them. Maybe they were afraid COD players would be intimidated by them but who knows.

Lack of Characters: Didn't wanna put any more time and effort to design more for this game I guess. 

Good Points: 
OverRun is fun. 
Declassified missions are fun. However I think thy should just include this in an arcade mode instead. 
That's all I've got. Thanks for reading those of you that did. Please leave your thoughts about the game in the comments.

1363826599.0	1ap9i7	Everything unique about Gears of War competitive multiplayer that made me love these games is gone in Judgment :(	snipe320	140	46	124	"I really wish I had rented the game before I bought it. I cannot understand some of these design decisions they made for the competitive multiplayer. Here's my list:

*  There are only 3 competitive game modes: FFA, Domination, &amp; TDM (at the **bottom** of the list? This is the only game type I ever really played...). Only 3 competitive modes?
* You can only pick one starting gun. This poses a huge problem as you place yourself at a severe disadvantage when using any guns other than the Gnasher or the Retro-Lancer. But then you cannot compete with trolls who are using long-range weapons. It's like you *are forced to choose between sucking close-range or sucking long-range* as opposed to the game being balanced.
* You can no longer plant grenades? What gives?
* There is no more DBNO (down but not out). This was SUCH a unique part of the game that I really enjoyed. What were they thinking? I loved that I could curb-stomp somebody that was chasing me forever, or pick up a DBNO enemy and use them as a shield.
* You can now use the boom shield with any gun. Stupid.
* No more perfect active reloads. (This one isn't so bad. I can see why. Jus' sayin'.)
* The maps are WAY too big for the Gears of War style of play. I played these games competitively to play intense close quarters battles with your team all near you and reviving each other etc. Say bye bye to this. TDM is basically now like Call of Duty where your team just serves as human shields and a basis to know where the enemy is. Teamwork is not necessary and does not help.
* Possibly the biggest beef: no COG vs. Locust??? AND only ~10 COG characters to choose from? Holy hell, what a fuck up. I have no fucking idea what they were thinking with this. Gears 3 had like ~50 COG &amp; Locust characters to choose from.


All of these things made Gears of War extremely unique and adrenaline-inducing to play. I really wish they could just add a section of multiplayer modes labeled ""Classic"" or the-like and add Gears of War 3 style game modes where you can pick two starting weapons. It wouldn't fix all of the things I find putrid about it, but it would certainly help. But for now I guess I'm back to Gears 3, which is sad because I enjoy the new weapons, grenades and grenade mechanics.

1364059543.0	1av84z	Tips on how to enjoy GOWJ	cevo70	89	14	94	"I am not going to say I love all the changes, but this is still Gears and it's still fun.  4 maps is garbage, I miss the visceral executions, and it does feel trimmed down compared to the very full GoW3.   I miss horde, for sure.  The campaign is still great (especially co-op) and I'd like to make a case that all of the MP changes aren't worth getting angry about.  

Here's what I suggest. 

1.  Stop comparing it to other franchises.   It's pointless.   It's still miles away from Halo or CoD.

2.  Accept and enjoy that you'll need to adapt new strategies.  Many of the changes that get ripped on, are actually helping solve previous frustrations and just changing successful play styles.  Active reload and DBNO are cool, and we've enjoyed them, but they also dictated strategies that got stale.   Firing off blank shots to get active, and gnasher-downing people from 15 feet away....eh.   It was def effective, but silly and annoying to be on the receiving end of.   Planting grenades was all sorts of effective, but even though I was very good at it, it's pretty f'n cheap.  I could go on, but the point is that stripping some of the old ""features"" goes a long way towards refining an effective, cleaner strategy. 

3.  Fly around in a fucking helicopter.  Practice with the new weapons, like a one-person vulcan and new grenades.  Wreck shop with the scorcher (it's really good now).  Jump off any/all ledges to get behind the enemy.  Run with the boom shield while holding your lancer!  Aka, enjoy the new stuff - it's good.  It's fast, but it's not that mad rush to the middle either.  It requires new approaches and play styles.   It's refreshing. 

4.  Try beating 10 rounds of Survival.   It's not horde, but it's still fun and requires team coordination in a much different way.

5.  Remember that you can still be elite, but it might not be in your first 10 matches.   I am already learning that, right from the first seconds, you can't do what used to work.  You don't rush the 2-3 power weapons - they aren't centralized as clearly as they used to be.  Get the ones closer to you - grab ammo crates because you'll need it and the extra grenade is key.  I've had more success traveling around perimeters quickly.   

6. Think about picking a role via your primary/grenade - I've seen some very effect hammer-bursters using tactical/support grenades, and then more typical close-ranged fraggers/inkers. 

7.  The maps are very different in design.  Elevation is much more intricate.  They are far less symmetrical overall.   Learning the routes and right places to lurk around solo, or grab control of with your team, are less obvious.   It's not quite as clear as camping/holding the middle power weapon. 

I can understand some of the complaints, I really can.  I've loved this series since day 1 and can be resistant to change.  I do think it's a less robust sequel compared to GoW3, out of the gates.  I don't like the cash-grab with the season pass and 4 maps.  I miss horde.   But I am still a fan and enjoying Judgement quite a bit.    The MP feels much cleaner and harder to exploit so far.

1367565719.0	1dlvuk	GOW:J Massive Update Info	-bam	66	4	84	"Massive updates that should go live soon, possibly as early as of 9AM EST tomorrow. Some of the changes were in response to your feedback over the last couple weeks here on the forums, on twitter, facebook, etc.:

- Dual weapon loadout will be propegated to all playlists with the exception of FFA.
- Stim grenades will be removed from all playlists with the exception of FFA.
- Torquebow charge time reduced back to Gears 3 Active levels (from 2 seconds down to 1.5 seconds).
- Prize boxes updated in the next TU to deliver all content before doling out XP (instead of assigning randomly).

We also went through the community feedback list and looked at everything we could. Here's a rehash of our response from tonight's live stream event:


I. Maps / Content

A. Only 4 traditional multiplayer maps
Map counts increased significantly with current and future DLC. Everyone has had great feedback on what they'd like to see in the future, and we're still working on getting you guys new content. Not sure that we'd be able to pull over a massive content dump from Gears 3, but we’re definitely working on incremental changes that will get you guys what you want. More DLC is coming, stay tuned!

B. Maps are not symmetrical
DLC maps are either symmetrical or much more symmetrical than release maps. Think layouts that are “more Haven, less Gondola”.

C. Maps are too big
Future DLC map designs are smaller and/or flow better so that combat is less segregated. We’re also setting up hard swaps that focus the action along the midline for Execution.

D. Updates are only “Server side”
We have made an effort to get changes up and tested as early as possible so that we can include them in the required title updates. This will ensure that a good number of the changes are actually present in a LAN setting. We’re also posting change notes and trying to be proactive with communication before changes are implemented.

E. No Locusts in standard versus multiplayer
This cannot be changed at this point. We can, however, make some changes to improve sound and visual recognition between teams. More on that to follow.

 
II. Melee

A. Reverse 2 Piece possible
We’ve adjusted melee pretty significantly to address these issues. If melee is in the game, you will always be able to shoot someone, and then finish them with a hit. We’ve adjusted delays a bit to help prevent this tactic from being abused, and adjusting it too much further will create the unnatural delays and obstructions to gameplay that we have previously removed in response to your feedback on this very topic.

B. Speed
See above.

C. Range
We have not seen a range difference, and the code has not changed in that regard. There is a chance that latency is affecting this in some circumstances, and it will require more investigation.


III. Matchmaking / Ranked (Incentive)

A. Too many playlists
We’re still working on solutions to this problem, but it is a highly complicated beast (of our own making, to be sure).

B. Ranked vs. Quick match Experience earned
Ranked XP will be increased. We’re working on some other incentives to draw people into Ranked as well (more “competitive-style settings”, for example).

C. Little incentive to play ranked
Judgment does indeed use skill-based ranking as part of its matchmaking algorithm. In point of fact, it essentially IS the Halo matchmaking system as that was the standard put forth by Microsoft. The main difference is that we do it under the hood. This does mean that we don’t have a ranked league-style system, and adding that at this point would unfortunately be out of scope for Judgment. We’re working on other Ranked incentives, however, that don’t require a full redesign of our matchmaking, UI, and infrastructure.


IV. Weapon Balancing (Spawn / Power)

A. Gnasher
We’re working on a fix to allow players the option to toggle their on-screen reticule. The close range “inconsistency” people report is actually an intentional fix that favors the player to ensure they get a proper kill when the barrel of the gun is touching another player’s cylinder. An ammo count change is highly contentious in public forums, and we feel pretty strongly that the current ammo levels actually favor Judgment’s weapon balance. The best option at this point is to increase ammo to 16 and try it in the Test Server.

B. Lancer
A change to the Lancer may indeed favor competitive players who intend on using it in a support capacity. However, the larger majority of the community does not appear to agree that it needs updating. It is currently performing in its intended role across all gametypes, and changing it could create a cascading effect that requires a rebalance of all starting weapons.

Changing to a two-weapon loadout is unlikely to create a huge imbalance in the weapons. The reality of the game stats is that within a few seconds of spawning, you’re either dead, or you have a secondary weapon anyway, so pulling that back to spawn doesn’t significantly move the needle in terms of game balance.

That said, the best option is to make your suggested changes in the Test Server, along with the Gnasher changes, and see how it plays out. We’ll do that ASAP. We’ll start with the clip size reduction and make further updates if necessary.

C. Booshka
Agreed. Clip size and starting ammo being reduced.

D. Boomshot
Agreed. Starting ammo being reduced.



V. Grenade Balancing

A. Ink Grenade
Internal QA is looking into the reported issues. More info to follow.

B. Stim Grenade
Stim grenade being removed from loadout and moved to a pickup in some playlists.

C. Ammo boxes
We’ll try pulling grenades out of ammo boxes in the Test Server, and propagate globally if there is a good response.


VI. Audio (In-Game)

A. Sound isn’t accurately location based
We can’t realistically change our sound engine at this point, but we can (and will) significantly reduce your (and your team’s) footstep volume. If you hear someone, that’ll pretty much guarantee that they are an enemy. We could also reduce the radius of the footstep sound a bit to make it less apparent when they’re above/below you, but that would require a Title Update to implement, and another to change back if the change isn’t well received. Probably too risky at this point.



VII. Glitches

A. Movement
Not getting into cover is due to a series of complicated factors that are made more apparent by Judgment’s increase in game speed and player density. We’ll look into it, but it may not be fixable.

B. Characters
Kim’s hitbox already fixed in the upcoming TU.

Boomshield already adjusted on female characters in the upcoming TU.

I’m not 100% clear on the characters failing to show visual recognition on successive shots, but if I had to guess, I’d say that is by design to prevent them from spamming the same animation over and over while taking damage. As long as the other visual feedback is registering (blood, etc.) then I don’t see this as a major problem. Will need to investigate further.

C. In Game
If players can join a private game, then that is a bug – unless it is from a player following someone in the game who is NOT set to private (that’s a Microsoft rule). QA is investigating.


VIII. Final Suggestions

A. Domination Gametype
Changed time to break hills from 2 seconds to 1 second.

B. Upgrade spectator mode (mega wish)
Extremely out of scope for Judgment, but excellent feedback for the future.

C. Theater mode (mega wish)
Extremely out of scope for Judgment, but excellent feedback for the future.

Please don't change anything. 

Don't worry about making ”Old School Playlists”, or making the Sawed Off Shotgun a pickup weapon only, or any of that crazy nonsense. Believe it or not, some people are okay with what's new.

My kill/death rate sucks, because I haven't gotten used to the fact that someone may be camping with an SOS. But that's okay too. Some of us are having fun adapting to the new game, instead of crying about it all day.

Thanks for listening.

I got banned for ever off the forums due to putting up a very constructed and detailed post on my pros and cons of this game. 
I didn't swear, spam or bad mouth the game, I put up just what could be tweaked or fixed and the responses were great. Probably over 90% of the replies were positive and agreed. 

Peter Nub says the reason he brought back execution is because the forums were spammed with ""bring back execution"" threads. But to be honest, I've seen more ""patch the 2-piece &amp; melee"" threads.

But see if you put one bad thing on the forum that maybe needs a tweak or fix, they take it down straight away. 
I don't blame people for leaving the online of this game. I loved campaign and overrun. But the online aspect is just ""shoot &gt; miss &gt; melee"" 

I also agree with the top topic on this subreddit about splitting VIP and Standard. They should be one playlist, but if you bought VIP then you obviously still get double Xp.

I know that they should do new stuff when they bring out new titles, but I really wish it was like gears 1 again. Miss those days...I'm getting really put off online shooters now :("	t5_2ruzg	True

Since Judgment hit the shelves, all I have seen on this subreddit is how broken the game is. How much it sucks. How bad the skins are. How bad the maps are. How bad it is that there is only 4 of them. How bad the hit detection is. How bad the weapons are. How unbalanced the game is. Blah blah blah blah blah. 

I am sick of all this complaining. You know what? Epic didn't put a gun to your head or anyone else who bought this game and forced y'all to spend money on it. They didn't hide anything in the videos before the game dropped. Y'all know that there was only going to be 4 maps. Y'all knew that there were load outs now. Y'all knew that there would be new weapons. It is a new game for heavens sake. 

By the way, Gears 1,2, and 3 are still up and running. No one is forcing you to play the game. No one forced you to play it in the first place. It was YOUR decision to walk in, buy it and play it regardless of all the videos and the early access that y'all saw and played. 

Stop the bitching for all that is holy. Stop complaining that the game isn't like Gears 3 or how bad certain things are. Go back to the game that you want Judgment to be like and stay there. 

I love this franchise, been playing since release day of Gears of War. Even played a bit competitively and did very well on Gears of War and Gears of War 3. I have to say, Judgment is my second favorite installment behind Gears of War. 

No game is going to be perfect. No game is going to please everyone. Bitching about every little item on this subreddit or on Twitter is going to do nothing. 

It is sad to see this subreddit be nothing but complaining when it should be filled with discussion, gameplay and things of that nature. Maybe the mods could have one link on the side to a bitching thread or something like that so that everyone who want's to complain could go there instead of clogging the front page up.

I have been on this subreddit for a while and am honestly very close to leaving for good because of how ridiculous the complaining is about every little element of this game. 


Do with this thread whatever y'all want. Downvote it, downvote me, send me hate mail, etc. I know there are more of y'all around who enjoy the game for what it is than those who hate it and if not, that's seriously sad and shows what the games industry has become. 

Either way, I had to get this off my chest. 

Thanks y'all.

Edit: Well, looks like this subreddit has let me down for the last time. Can't have a discussion without the downvotes and shit throwing. Sad to see it go. Here's my last goodbye y'all. Thank to those who tried and acted like adults. Good luck to those.

I loved the tournaments and had a blast and it's where I met most of the guys and gals I play with on Gears now. So for those of you who are new and curious about the tournaments we held. Here's a quick run-down.

First tournament was 1v1's. We had about 8 people show up with the final 3 being Detestify, Simfox3, and yours truly. Detestify won (he's a mod now!) and earned himself that little golden omen flair.

Second tournament was also fun. It was xXManWithAPlanX's team (I believe Mr.R4IN, Savage Cries, and...ummm someone.) against Team Savage which included Detestify, Simfox, MR.Mocca and myself. Manwithaplan's team won earning the red omen skull with the crown as flair.

These are the only two successful Reddit-Gears tournaments held thus far. I tried a wingman tournament and even created a flair for it (a trophy with wings) but we only had 2-3 sign-ups and so I was forced to cancel it. 

But now since we have so many more people and I would simply love to meet more Reddit-Gears players I will organize another competition for us all!

Yes there will be prizes besides flair. xXManWithAPlanXx won a poster that I bought for being MVP of this winning team (because of mailing issues it isn't sent yet, but I'm doing it today after work. I hate my local mail office.)

Edit: **The awesome employee known as Troy Mcklure (has an Epic flair next to his name) has contacted other employees to provide prizes for the tournaments such as exclusive characters. Which is better than my lame flair and posters!**

This thread will be in the sidebar along with additional information about past tournaments. So check it regularly!
*****
*****
Edit: **The other mods and I have decided that no matter what game-type is chosen. You must have had a Reddit account  prior to the announcement of the tournament. AND your account must be verified. Once I open sign-ups you will have to send me a message with your gamertag so I may check your legitimacy. Otherwise we will have MLG players coming in solely to win the great prizes being handed out.**


**Now my friends and fellow gear-heads. What do *you* think?**







**TL;DR: This is a 2v2 tournament with prizes being handed out by Epic themselves.**
*****
*****
*****
*****

*****

After MUCH discussion and planning with the other mods here is everything that is going on! Sign up is being posted now but I urge you to read **EVERYTHING** from here down:

The playtypes will be:

 **2v2 Execution**; 4 rounds; 5 minutes each; hypefestation weapon spawns (everything is the same except there are *no* boltoks or gorgons). This also means there is no Hammerburst/Retro/or Sawed-off allowed at ANY point in this competition.

**2v2 KotH**; First team to 210; 1 round. Same weapon spawns as execution.


The playtypes go in the following order: Execution,Execution, and in the event of a tie: KotH


The prize distribution: As Troy stated he has a character code for each character available. That makes a total of 5 character codes. A season pass code and the secret prize.

Once all teams are eliminated (it's single elimination) the final two teams will face off. The winners of the entire tournament then 1v1 each other (WHAT A TWIST!). The winner of this 1v1 gets first choice from one of ANY of the prizes that have been mentioned. (DLC character, season pass, secret prize). The loser of that 1v1 becomes 2nd pick of all the things available. THEN the 2nd placed team 1v1 each other in the same fashion resulting in a 3rd prize picker and 4th prize picker. This will leave codes remaining, which is what we wanted. All of the remaining codes will be raffled off between all other players that did win. (Using a random number generator corresponding with the seed numbers given to you when you sign up) Rotaz broke it down for us here.

1st pick: Winning team - winner of 1v1


2nd pick: Winning team - loser of 1v1


3rd pick: Losing team - winner of 1v1


4th pick: Losing team - lower of 1v1


Then raffle off the remaining 3 prizes. This way it avoids any kind of unfairness due to the fact that there are teams of 2 and prizes of different value.

As for the matches themselves: **YOU** are responsible for fighting the team that you are assigned to fight. It will be up to you for you guys to get together and fight. Then report the scores (with proof) to me. Once you sign up I will announce the beginning of the tournament on this thread Next Weekend on Saturday (not tomorrow).

I will THEN post what teams need to face off within the next 48 hour period. If you have NOT fought the opposing team within that 48 period both teams will forfeit and I move on to the next team match-up.

I would **LOVE** for someone to record each match with a capture card so I can make a compilation video and get some peeps to commentate it for me. A ""Highlights"" reel if you wish. So if you have a capture card let me know and I'll put your name on this thread. (Include your gamertag) 

If there name is listed under here then before each match PLEASE try to get in contact with one of them through Reddit or Xbox Live before your assigned match:
None

None

None

None

None

Sign-Up: Ok read this **CAREFULLY** I realize that some of you do not have a 2v2 partner. So when you sign up I want you to put your gamertag with an asterisk (Synopsi*) next to it so I know that you are by yourself and I will pair you randomly with one of the other players who are also by themselves. There is a 16 team limit so sign up quickly!

As for teams: You must put this in the CORRECT FORMAT: ""&lt;Team Name&gt;-&lt;Member One&gt;&lt;comma&gt;&lt;Member Two&gt;"". You must USE YOUR ACTUAL gamertag. This way I can contact you in case of a change.

That's it for now guys! Sign Up --**SIGN UP CLOSED**

**REMEMBER TO SEND ME A MESSAGE WITH YOUR REDDIT ACCOUNT CONTAINING YOUR GAMERTAG SO I CAN VERIFY**
*****
**ALSO**: People are confused how this will work. So once again, once all slots are filled for the tournament I will randomize all of your seeds and it will match you with a random team. The first team on my list will appear and I will announce the beginning of the tournament with your team [the entire first bracket] (On Saturday March 3rd). I will send you messages on Reddit AND on Xbox Live to notify you and have it posted on this thread (check it regularly) You will have a 48 hour period to contact the people you are to face and your own teammates, complete the match and report back to me (YOU WILL NEED PROOF, A PICTURE OR VIDEO WILL BE FINE. UNLESS BOTH TEAMS AGREE TO WHO WON/LOST, I EXPECT REPORTS FROM BOTH SIDES.). When I post the teams that are facing off I will post their names and gamertags so you know who to contact. If you have any questions feel free to ask.

GoW3 has a significantly higher population per playlist. I love the coming changes they are adding in the next title update and still want to have faith in this game, but I think it's over. 

The *only* real way they will make me stay for the long run is if they add DBNO, and it can be easily added. That's all. Because of the absent DBNO, you die twice as fast. Fuck that Call of Duty shit. I play Gears because it's *not* Call of Duty. I just really hope EPIC learns from this mistake, because I really do respect them.

http://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/y5hgk/i_like_a_challenge_but_this_is_the_most_insane_yet/

I really did it, r/Gears. I actually was much more successful than I hoped. I started a day later than I said I would, August 15th instead of the 14th. I played Gears 3 with my buddies until they left, then began my journey, approximately 1:15 AM. I beat Gears one in about 7 and a half hours, then began Gears Two. That took me MUCH longer, starting from 9:00 AM to Midnight, although I DID stop for food breaks and a powernap. From there, I worked on Gears 3 until 5 AM, then took another powernap/light sleep. I woke up at 10 AM and resumed it, finishing by 3 PM. The grand total of my time was 1 and a half days. I also kept track of my deaths. I died a total of 405 times, 86 in Gears 1, 184 in Gears 2, and 135 in Gears 3. This doesn't necessarily prove that Gears 2 is the hardest, but it's definitely the one I had the most trouble with. I consumed 4 energy drinks to stay awake and only ate 2 sandwiches and a bowl of cereal to avoid taking too much extra time. It was fun. Hard, but fun. I'd recommend that anyone who loves Gears and a challenge try this over a weekend or such.

Edit: I'm sorry I have no way of providing video of any sort. I do not have a capture card, but if I did, I would have been happy to record it, although streaming seems like a bit more effort than I wanted. I'm not even sure anyone would want to sit through 60 hours of me playing it."	t5_2ruzg	True

1317316611.0	kvgto	On r/Gaming and Gears of War, and consoles in general...	mopecore	37	7	29	"I've seen several threads referring to r/gamings at best lukewarm reception to GOW3, and I wanted to add my two cents, as it were.

I love Gears as a series, and for my $59.99, Gears 3 is one of the best games of this console generation.  Single player, multiplayer, co-op, I'll be playing this for a number of years, I think (I *just* stopped playing BFBC2 religiously when GOW3 came out). I would probably have paid forty bucks for a disk that just had Horde on it.

All that said, I don't care *at all* what r/gaming thinks of it.  I'm having fun with it. I personally can't get into TF2, I've never played WoW, and if halflife three comes out... well, I still have havent finished episode 2.  Or episode 1.  Or HL2.  So, no, the fact that PC centric r/gaming doesn't like Gears as much as me doesn't effect me in the slightest.  People often dislike things I like, and I'm sure the same is true for almost all of us.

What bugs me *a little* is the assumption that anyone who plays console games is a either a slobbering moron, high on MtnDew Halo Jizz, a hyper aggressive frat boy, or 12.  Or some combination of the three.  What *pisses me off* is how often this is true.  In three of my last eight games played, the first thing over the mic was some white kid introducing himself with ""What's up, Niggers?""  Different kids, different modes, same stupid shit over the mic.  I had one kid talk incessantly for 23 waves of Horde, ""Sup, Niggers?  Yo, dawg, you faggots suck.  I'm so baked...""  Meanwhile, he's consistently bottom of the board, and if there is a ""mute player"" feature in Gears, I haven't found it. 

I've been playing primarily on consoles for 24 years.  I play PC games, but I have to admit, if I have to pick a camp, I'm a console gamer.  And like many of you (I'm sure) I **hate the shit out of a lot of other console gamers.**

Gears 3, can not in any way shape or form be played like its predecessors, if anything its like they combined #1's movement, #2's hit detection and weapons and then threw in some call of duty rifles. 

    -The shotguns
 -The sawed off is not op, the sawed off is garbage, do not use the sawed off unless you are an expert bouncer

 -The gnasher is your friend, the gnasher rapes the sawed off, the gnasher reaches past your dick.
   Basically here are your 4 lineups for shotguns, i'll tell you how to best use the two regardless of the fact that i have been neglecting the sawed off and am skeptical of its practicality (g= gnasher, s= sawed off) 

GvG basic shotty battle, utilize cover AVOID rolling as your hitbox will double in size, if your inwards of about 10 feet try and do some bouncing and blind fire, outwards of ten feet use the cover more heavily and use quick ADS shots

GvS back peddle, jump back and laugh as they crumble before you

SvS straight bounce battle, be careful to shoot first but if you do make sure its a gib

SvG I really wouldn't recommend it but if you do want to try it you've got to keep your enemy from using the range advantage, while rushing corners CAN work for you it CAN just as easily fuck you over. For this match up either bounce like a pro or sneak like a ninja.

     -The starting rifles

-Lancer, fire away you have a clip with nearly a hundred shots, ridiculous stopping power and decent damage. Don't underestimate how close you can kill someone with a shotty, don't kill yourself trying to switch if they're closing in , the stopping power can leave them dead in their tracks

-Hammer burst, Insane stopping power and damage, great range. Its a semi auto sniper and is my weapon of choice for rifles. In a 1v1 rifle right it WILL beat the other two rifles so long as the actives are even or on your side. 
 
-Retro lancer, Its an automatic shotgun with a knife, use it as such.

For shotties v rifles wait for them to reload and never ever try and rush them in the open, they will win. Be mindful of their teammates and the deadly crossfire that can exist when you have 2+ people firing on you. Never underestimate their range especially with the horrid cover on some of these maps and the increased ranges of the rifles."	t5_2ruzg	True

Simply, multiplayer is failing.

I used to play Gears so well, all the time. Lately, I have been doing very badly, and my KD is dropping very quickly. Throughout my recent playtime, I have noticed that THE GNASHER DOES NOT WORK LIKE IT USED TO. 

I do a quick dive roll behind an enemy, as usual. He has no idea I am there, shooting at enemies far away in his view. I stop, for a good 1-2 seconds, aim my gnasher directly at his back. There is virtually no room in between us. He doesn't die. He jumps back at me then saws-me-off.

This has happened well over 10 times, in many different games.

My friends and I are constantly badgered on xbox live for using the Lancer as a primary, why? They tell me that I should learn to use ""a real weapon."" What weapon am I using then? When someone is stupid enough to rush out of cover at me with an active reload lancer, and I calmy walk backwards and pepper them, punishing them for their over aggression instead of pulling out my shotgun (which I use alot more than my lancer anyways) to engage in strafing left and right until one of us hits home I dont think thats a fault on my behalf.

The highest rated comments on videos like that really bother me. This is gears of war. ""Take cover or die."" The lancer is the flagship weapon, not a shotgun. The lancer is the primary weapon, not the shotgun. Using the shotgun are a primary does not make you ""pro.""

1368389818.0	1e78fm	I want to make a guide, but not just any old guide, and I need YOUR help.	Edallag	29	7	46	"* **Goal**: 
So here is what I'm looking to do. I want to compile the ULTIMATE guide to everything Gears. Story, how to play, level tips, etc etc, across the entire Gears of War mythos, level tips for EVERY map in the Gears catalogue. I'm talking best places to snipe, how to hold rings in KOTH / Domination, etc, as well as weapon combinations for Judgement. I also want to include a ***very*** brief Achievement how-to list, that targets some of the wackiest (and hardest) 'Chieves to obtain. 


* **Target Audience**: Professionals who are looking to fine-tune their Gears experience, as well as new people who are just getting into Gears, and everyone in between.


* **Execution of Guide**: Obviously, we aren't all made of money, plus I'm missing Gears 2, as well as a bunch of DLC for Gears 1 (and the first paid DLC for Judgement), so it'd be kinda hard to do a map section for those, plus since I'm dealing with personal matters (Father is getting ready to go into Chemo for Lung Cancer, plus I'm devoting a bunch of time to look for work), I won't have a whole lot of time to making the guide.


* **How you can help**: If you have any tips, tricks, etc etc, please feel free to post them in the thread! If you stumble upon overhead maps (preferably with weapon spans included) (you know, the ones you see before EVERY match), upload them to [Imgur](http://imgur.com), and post them in the thread! If you wanna help by donating (though I don't know anyone who WOULD, but it'd be greatly appreciated), you can send me a PM, and I'll send you a reply with my paypal url, so that you can donate that way, OR if you would like to send me a copy of Gears 2, I can give you my address. Every little bit helps, and I'll be keeping a record of everyone who helps with the guide, so I'll know who to thank when we are finished.

* **Guide Status:** Started. If you want to see what I have, [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sjq55fhcyATRVpvP1t-stK5umsipJ9lcupiWwOo8DLA/edit?usp=sharing) is where I'll be working on it. Please use this to track all changes to the guide, as well as additions, etc etc. Message me with an email address if you wish to add and help contribute to the guide. 


If you wanna help me out with certain 'Myths' (Will a Grenade still explode after you die, etc etc), my Gamer tag is FLS Edallag. I'm normally on Noon - 3am EST. I have a busted-ass mic for the moment, so please bear with me while my newish one is on its way.*


This can't be done by a single person, and anyone who helps will be rewarded in some way. I'm looking forward to working hard to make this something that is up-to-date, and able to help out all kinds of Gears players.

If for some reason there is already something like this, then please let me know, so that I'm not left looking like a dork.

Edit 1: Revised the layout a little, and added more contact information

Edit 2: Added guide status, and link to guide.

Edit 3: After the 23rd (of May), there will be a period of time where I will not have Internet access, so I'm messaging those who have helped thus far to see if they would like to help take over process on the guide, until I am able to secure a semi-stable Internet line.

Edit 4: I've updated the Table of Contents, and added a few tips and tricks to start it off, officially. I'll work on it when I can while my connection is down, and update it as soon as possible. Possibly going to try to work on getting the guide added to the sidebar once it is moderately finished, as well as making another thread to link back to this one, to draw more people here, as well as the guide."	t5_2ruzg	True

If you don't have somebody with resupply as their ability you're all pretty much fucked.

Nothing could pull me away from Halo2. For 2 years I played only Halo2. Until Gears came out. It became the go to game for my son and I. We bonded big time over GOW2 and got him his own gold profile. He passed me up in skill no problem even though I've been a gamer since pong. Even though I would drag him down wingman, he would play with me for the fun instead of for the win.

We spent a fortune on the Gears franchise. Owning 3 copies of GOW, 4 copies of GOW2, we bought a second xbox so we could both play full screen, GOW3, map packs, weapon skins, clothes, figures, etc...

Not only were the games fun, but I also enjoyed the interaction at the Epic forums. Getting in on the Beta's, offering suggestions, building a 90% GOW friend list.

And then my son decides he's going to modify a weapon skin. Stupid teenager thing to do. And the ban hammer comes down hard. All 4 xbox live gold accounts on our xbox banned. My 2 other sons and I are devastated. I head to the forums to find out what my son had done. I tried to reason with the forum moderators and Epic games. Just ban HIM I said, why should the rest of us suffer. To teach him a lesson they (they being forum moderator Flak, AKA Stacey Connely, AKA iFlak on XBL) said. One of my sons lives away from home I argued, he's banned because his profile has been on my xbox before. Too bad, they said. 

Now I can see if he was modifying things to have an unfair advantage in online competition. But a weapon skin? I was away on business when it happened. My son was so scared to tell me because it was the only game I played from the day it came out. So I said goodbye to my friends on the Epic forums. Told my tale of woe, AND WAS BANNED from the forums because I said that I thought the moderator told me to fuck off, but in a polite way.

So a few months later my Xbox elite disk drive dies. God forbid my gaming household go without one while I order a new diskdrive. So we get a new one and it comes with a free month of gold. Well I was having some cocktails that night and my son and I bonded one last time over Gears. [Venting our frustration we created a new account just for the beloved Flak over at the Epic forums.](http://imgur.com/a/uZbyA)

Petty and childish I know. But we laughed together so it was worth it. Still deciding if we will pick up Judgment or not. Hard not to, but then again, our loyalty was not even considered before, so who knows. Maybe I'll make the boy buy it. Yea, that will probably work.

Thank you all for the feedback. There are a lot here, and though I would love to do all of them it would take ages. Here are the ones I am going to get done, and will make publicly available to you all.

Marcus Fenix's Perfect Reload: Nice!

Act2 - Marcus says ""Got your number bitch..."" in the cutscene with Myrrah.

Marcus': bring it!

Frag Grenade proximity beeps.

A Locust Laugh, as well as several other locust voices.

Several Kantus Phrases

carmine: ""In the zone!""

Where can I find ""cole train runs on the whole grain""?

I will try like hell for the Omen sound too, I agree that it would be an awesome sound. I haven't got them all, so I have the ability to record one of them.

Thanks again and keep these suggestions coming!

Then, they also held hands together in one spot, allowing the enemy to collect any weapons the want and get any position they want.
Finally, and worst of all, they ignored any possible teamwork. There were literally times when I would spot an enemy, and my teammate (who could have gotten a cross) walks right past him.

I ended up completing the campaign on normal, aftermath, a couple overrun matches, and a bit of the other multiplayer modes, mainly tdm. 
    
 1. The campaign: I actually enjoyed playing it. I didn't care to much for the story, but it was fun to play. i liked the declassified mechanic and seeing the star meter fill up.
 2. Aftermath: I never really cared for Baird in the 3rd game, but the thing he does (no spoiler) was pretty cool, and quite a fun addition to play.
 3. Overrun: I actually like the mode a lot more than I thought i would. the demo of it showed potential, but i wish there were more locusts, and maybe another cog, like an onyx guard. This mode would probably be fun as a moba of some sort.
 4. Multiplayer: I really didn't enjoy it all that much, the levels i played on were chaotic and didn't have the chemistry of 3, except that I found Gondola a lot of fun to play on.

Cons: I miss DBNO in multiplayer, even if it cost me stupid kills sometimes, other times I stood up, like a glorious phoenix from the ashes, right as the first guy rolls into my gnasher barrel. 

The locust in multiplayer wasn't as big of a deal as i thought, mainly because I just saw skins and couldn't tell the characters. the only character I could actually tell from a glance was sophia. 

The new controls were also a bit frustrating for me. I use tac/com all the time to check corners and where my teammates are, so replacing that with a grenade caused a lot of misfire and suicide. 

Final thought: Was pretty fun for 24 hours, but i'm glad I didn't buy it. Back to gears 3. "	t5_2ruzg	True

For the longest time, I've wanted Epic to make a Gears game where every map on Sera can be traveled to in an open world, free roam-style sandbox game (sort of like Red Dead Redemption's free roam mode) instead of just having each mp map as complete seperate mp games. 

https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3287/3019089047_c7b2583e2c_o.jpg

or  http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3287/3019089047_c7b2583e2c_o.jpg

http://gearsofwar.wikia.com/wiki/Sera

Ok, now before you start with all the ""that's not Gears"" and ""if you want free roam, go play Red Dead Redemption"" just hear me out.

Let's say, for example, the entire planet of Sera is one big open world where players can travel to each location (map) at any time, either by foot, land vehicle, or even air vehicle. The goal is of course to capture, secure and defend as many locations as possible against locust hordes. 

Now, imagine that one squad is being overrun at Azura while I and my squad are at some other location that we've already secured. I would love to be able board a King Raven, a Corva, or roll through in a Centaur, or an Armadillo, etc and rush over there to assist them. 

Conversely, enemies could do the same and travel to other areas  inorder to try and overrun other locations on the fly. Locusts would also have the ability to dig their way to other locations, travel on Brumak, Reavers, etc. 

Additionally, weapons, ammo, and supplies would be scattered throughout the open world. So, as you travel between locations you can pick them up.

It would allow for the most epic scale Gears battles ever. Every capture and every lost location would take place in real time and ultimately effect the outcome of the war. 

It would truly be a ""Battle for Sera,"" being waged simultaneously in real time -- not just a game of 'one map only' Horde mode. It could be called Epic mode.

I'm sure not everyone will like my suggestions as some gamers immediate inclination is to fear and resist even the slightest hint at change, but what do YOU think? 

Don't forget to upvote if you like this idea.
And if you do like this idea, we should all flood Epic's official site with requests that they make such a mode or game.

Remember though, this is just a thought, I don't know everything and this thought is still a work in progress. Also sorry that the order of the thoughts is not perfect, but it is a work in progress like I said. 

So you start the game as a stranded. Then the world would be set up like Dragon Age games or like the Fable games. I don't think it would work to well under a completely open game world such as Skyrim. The time period could be debatable but I think that as you complete the main  mission of the game it would progress through time. 

Now there could be an experience system put in place where you level up as you go. Also when you level up you can increase certain statistics such as melee, active reload, damage from weapons, etc. Now also this means you could possibly have different classes to start the game. These classes could be the same classes for the upcoming GOW: Judgment (Scout, Soldier, Engineer, Medic). These classes could obviously have different attributes to them. Such as the Scout has the ability to sneak and is more accurate with the sniper, Soldier has more health and does more damage, Engineer can repair vehicles and weapons, Medic can heal teammates and themselves. 

I think that the game should start before the first game, but should lead up to the lightmass bomb going off. Then the game should keep going progressing through the next two games. The missions would include various things such as working for other stranded or helping out the gears. Also, ammo would be scarce along with weapons. I also think there would have to be some kind of money system put into place. I'm not sure what you could use for that, because in a world that it is set in, it would mostly be trading one item for another. 

Now the weapons I feel you could add a few more for melee since ammo would be scarce. The melee weapons could be anything from a baseball bat to a knife that you add for melee. Also, I think that you should have the option to upgrade them and change the style of them such as the color. Also I think there would be different styles of clothing that would give you different abilities and armor ratings. Obviously setting onyx guard armor at the highest and your basic stranded clothing as the lowest armor. Working for people would give you different awards such as working for the gears would slowly give you better weapons and better armor. 

Maybe you could also set it up like Borderlands where someone can join someone else's game and you can play through it with 2-4 people. 

Now there is obviously plenty more thought that needs to be put into this, mostly with the story line. My idea for the main story would be something revolving around the main character losing his family and his search for them. This story makes sense because everybody in the game has lost someone during the course of the games/books. This could lead the game in many different directions.

Remember though, this idea is not perfect and will probably never happen, but it is just a thought for a game that I feel I would enjoy playing. 


UPDATE: I'm currently working on an actual storyline for it, not a crazy in-depth, down to the last detail storyline, but a more in depth one than what is on here. I will hopefully have it finished within the next few days or hopefully next week depending on how much work I get from my college professors. I will post it on here when finished so please check back in next week and let me see your feedback on the storyline. "	t5_2ruzg	True

The only reason I pick them up is to stay with my friends I made who transitioned over from gears of war, to Halo, to Call of Duty etc. I feel like it is the same thing over and over and over and over. I haven't even looked into what is new with the new Call of Duty, to me it seems like it might as well have been an expansion. 

So because I have been so satisfied with Gears of War 3, and I don't feel the need to drop $60 on another generic FPS, I have cleaned out my friends list and made room for some more Gears friends. 

I'm a competitive person, but I'm not a dick. I try to separate myself from the guys that think they are the best players on this game and have to make excuses as to why they lost, so if this is you, please don't add me. I rarely talk trash and while I communicate with my team, it's no biggie if I lose. I'm currently a level 89 and play at different times of day (I live in California). I'm looking for like minded players, preferably over the age of 18, that want to party up.

I usually play Team Death Match and Warzone... Usually quick matches but if I have a team of four or five (Or if there is nothing in quick matches but bots) I'll play ranked.

After having the game for almost a week now, I'd say I've become fairly proficient at dealing with SOS players and making them look stupid. So instead of hopping on the forums and bitching about it I've been grinding in-game figuring out how to beat this shit. Here are a few things I've learned that might help some of my fellow Gears who are struggling with fighting SOS users.

**1: You're going to die unreasonably from time to time.**

Make no mistake about it, you *will* die to someone hiding around a corner waiting for you to walk by every now and then. You'll get killed when you fucking *swear* that you shot first, etc. This shit is going to happen and it's part of the game. Deal with it.

**2: Be constantly looking for what the enemy is carrying.**

This is something that I'm still working on since I got the game and I'm still not perfect but it's a skill that has helped me a lot versus the SOS. Look at an approaching enemy, really look. Does he have a SOS in his hands? Okay. Roll away from him, do not meet him head on. Roll away, whip out a rifle or popshot his ass. Simple as that.

**3: Is someone roadie running straight at you?**

Guess what? He's not running in for a hug--he's got the SOS. And guess what? You probably won't be able to kill him first with a Gnasher, just accept that. So here's what you do--roll away if he's getting too close and rifle him down. Simple.

**4: Lateral movements = bad versus SOS**

It's no secret that the SOS has a very fucking wide spread. It's my normal reaction when in a shotgun duel to move laterally but I've realized that because of the wide spread, lateral movements versus SOS players are a bad idea. So, I've been working on incorporating less lateral movements and more backrolls in shotgun battles, just anticipating a SOS.

**5: Okay, so he missed. What now?**

So many times have I made a SOS player miss only to have him run away from me. First thing's first: do not try to down him with your Gnasher. It'll rarely work and he will get away. Don't be afraid to pull out the old rifle and try to finish the job.

Giving chase is a good idea as well--just don't get too close. He'll be reloaded before you know it. The better idea is to give chase but keep to mid-range and pressure him with rifle fire."	t5_2ruzg	True

EDIT (July 6th): 

**A little info on Canadian pre-order bonuses:**

I spoke with Amazon.ca today, and it turns out that they are likely not offering the Savage Kantus pre-order bonus. It also appears that the Limited and Epic editions are not going to be sold on Amazon.ca. Those wanting Savage Kantus can pre-order from Amazon.com seeing as they allow shipping to Canada, but there's a fee attached to it ($8.04 for ""import deposit fee"").

Walmart is taking pre-orders in person, but not online (their website sucks, apparently). It is likely that they are offering the Savage Grenadier Elite pre-order bonus, but I haven't confirmed it yet (the electronics department guy I spoke with didn't know what the bonus was).

Best Buy is taking pre-orders for standard edition (http://www.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/product/gears-of-war-3-xbox-360/10144575.aspx) and giving Mechanic Baird as a pre-order bonus. They are also not selling Epic or Limited editions.

And Gamestop (EB Games in Canada) has been offering pre-orders on everything, along with Com. Dom pre-order bonus. The Midnight Madness launch event is a possibility, but as of yet unconfirmed. An EB Games employee told me that he would know if there was a launch event, and what the MM bonus would be, around late August.

*************

EDIT (August 1st):

Added Aaron Griffin unlock. This code, given out by a facebook app, is available after you ""like"" their page. This code is simply early access; presumably Griffin is unlockable in-game at some level tier. This code just lets you play him from day 1.

Also added the Microsoft exclusive Green (sort of liquid-y skin). Rod Fergusson, in his latest stream, confirmed that those will be available in-game, but he didn't say how. Rod also mentioned that the COG Gear, voiced by the Old Spice guy (Isaiah Mustafa) would have a golden helmet, also unlockable in-game.

*************

EDIT: (August 15th):

Added Infected Omen, Golden Weapon info, and Veteran Gear info.


*************

EDIT (August 22nd):

**Canadian pre-order update:**

As mentioned before, Walmart is taking pre-orders in-store. It costs $10 + tax and you get a card with the savage grenadier elite code on it. I already redeemed mine! 

Credit to Plazeor on the EPIC forums for this information:

[Here's the pre-order card.](http://i1129.photobucket.com/albums/m518/fhazeout/Gow3Preorder.jpg)

On the back of the small card is the code, and instructions for pre-order redemption for the retailer.

*************

EDIT (August 31st):

Added info for Liquid Metal, MS-Green, and removed Midnight Madness bonus (since it is unlikely that there will be a midnight madness bonus).

*************
EDIT (September 2nd):

Added chrome, onyx, gold omen info.

My overall goal is 3 days (one for each game), but if it takes less than a week, I'll be satisfied. Starting tomorrow morning, I will start Act 1: Chapter 1 in Gears 1 and play as far as I can (hopefully beating it). Then I'll load up Gears 2 and endure the challenges thrown at me in that installment. Finally, I'll go back to Gears 3, and end the threat to humanity, most likely more battle-scarred than ever before. Wish me luck, and if desired, I'll update the post once I am finished and announce my time and experience.

I've never had so much fun playing a Gears game as I have through that small section of the story. It was engaging, fun, and humorous thanks to Train's classic one-liners.

&gt;What Maps Are We Playing and How Are They Decided?

Usually, I would put the maps that are in the MLG playlist rosters. But, I figure that to keep it fair (because some of us have a LOT more practice and strats on these maps then others) I will include ALL MAPS (except goddamn overpass) in this tournament. When I announce the bracket line-up I will also release the maps you are to play on. I select the maps using a number generator. For future reference the maps go as follows:
*****
1. Trenches

2. Dry Dock 

3. Sandbar

1330322124.0	q7ril	Important Tournament Information	Sinopsis	26	8	21	"Ok so the first thread has kinda become a clusterluck (see what I did there?) of different stuff. So to clarify completely on the rules and how this tournament will be taking place next weekend.

&gt;What are the gametypes and what order are we playing them in?

We will be playing the following with the following rules:

Execution; 4 rounds, 5 minute Hypefestation weapon spawns (everything is normal except no boltok or gorgon pistol), Lancer/gnasher only (No HB, Retro, or Sawed-Off).

KotH; 1 round,Hypefestation weapon spawns (everything is normal except no boltok or gorgon pistol), Lancer/gnasher only (No HB, Retro, or Sawed-Off).

After much discussion between us mods over what gametypes, we came up with the following order: First Game:Execution, Second Game: Execution, and a KotH tiebreaker in the case of a tie.

Yes, it is single elimination. If your team loses, you lose. No arguments, no disputes (unless of course a vital rule as stated above is violated of course). You lose.

&gt; Well how are we going to get the matches together?

This is kinda confusing so follow along: On Saturday, March 3rd I will announce the beginning of the tournament. On announcement day (Lets call it A-Day) I will release the first brackets for the tournament. I will include all players Reddit names AND gamertags so each team can contact each other. You will all be given a 48 period to complete your match and get back to me.

&gt;What about no-shows?

In the event that a team is NOT able to get in contact with its competitor the team that has PROOF (show me a sentbox screenshot on reddit and a picture of you sending a message to them over xbox) will automatically advance to the next round (Lucky you!). If a member of your team doesn't show up then...well...you're screwed. If you can find a last-minute replacement and they are a Redditor and you can verify them I will allow it. You can also try to 1v2 the opposing team. 

&gt;Didn't you say you wanted to record these matches?

Yes! For the love of all that is holy yes! I want people to spectate these matches for me and record using a video capture card of some sort and send me the footage, I want to edit all of the footage and make a Reddit-Gears highlights/montage reel. So contact me if you have the ability (if you are participating in the tournament and have one, let me know and I can set things up so someone else records yours and you can record others) to record. I would GREATLY appreciate it and I'm sure I could whip up some awesome flair for those who help me with this.

&gt;How are prizes being distributed?


Once all teams are eliminated (it's single elimination) the final two teams will face off. The winners of the entire tournament then 1v1 each other (WHAT A TWIST!). The winner of this 1v1 gets first choice from one of ANY of the prizes that have been mentioned. (DLC character, season pass, secret prize). The loser of that 1v1 becomes 2nd pick of all the things available. THEN the 2nd placed team 1v1 each other in the same fashion resulting in a 3rd prize picker and 4th prize picker. This will leave codes remaining, which is what we wanted. All of the remaining codes will be raffled off between all other players that did win. (Using a random number generator corresponding with the seed numbers given to you when you sign up) Rotaz broke it down for us here.

1st pick: Winning team - winner of 1v1


2nd pick: Winning team - loser of 1v1


3rd pick: Losing team - winner of 1v1


4th pick: Losing team - lower of 1v1


Then raffle off the remaining 3 prizes. This way it avoids any kind of unfairness due to the fact that there are teams of 2 and prizes of different value.

This will also give EVERYONE a chance, regardless of skill to earn a prize for participating. (I will be recording myself pressing the randomize number button so in case a mod wins a prize there will be no disputing. I will do all the prizes in one sitting.)

&gt;Well all this is awesome but how do I sign up?!

Sign-Up: Ok read this **CAREFULLY** I realize that some of you do not have a 2v2 partner. So when you sign up I want you to put your gamertag with an asterisk (Synopsi*) next to it so I know that you are by yourself and I will pair you randomly with one of the other players who are also by themselves. There is a 16 team limit so sign up quickly!

As for teams: You must put this in the CORRECT FORMAT: ""&lt;Team Name&gt;-&lt;Member One&gt;&lt;comma&gt;&lt;Member Two&gt;"". You must USE YOUR ACTUAL gamertag. This way I can contact you in case of a change.

That's it for now guys! Sign Up----**TOURNAMENT SIGN-UP CLOSED**----

**REMEMBER TO SEND ME A MESSAGE WITH YOUR REDDIT ACCOUNT CONTAINING YOUR GAMERTAG SO I CAN VERIFY**

&gt;How many teams have signed up so far?

So far: 16 teams. So sign-up while you can!

Ever have that moment where you look up at everything you just typed, and get kinda depressed? Yeah, that's a lot of stuff. Just happened.
*****
KillingEdge brought to my attention the host advantage problem. If anyone besides the video capture card people would be willing to host some of these matches it would be GREATLY appreciated, drop me a line and I'll add you to this page so people can ask you to host for them, teams ARE ALLOWED to get random people not from Reddit to host matches if needed. But they are to host, nothing more. They must spectate.

I would like to organize a tournament but would need help and input from others as to the mechanics and structure of such a tournament. I do not have experience hosting a gaming related tournament but learn quickly and would be happy to organize, advertise and officiate with some help. Ideally I would like to have something small this coming weekend and then something bigger over Thanksgiving break. If there is any others interested in helping and/or have input regarding structure, mechanics and location (days/times) of a tournament I would be happy to hear from you! It would be pretty cool if we could make this something regular. 

edit: What type of tournament do you all have in mind, team based or individual? So far it looks like Sunday early-afternoon is the ideal time, how does that sound as a possible time for a tournament? I'll start adding gamertags of people I'm not yet friends with and try to talk to everyone about their own ideas throughout the week.

edit2: So far we have about 20 people interested in the tournament which may increase as we continue towards making this a reality. As I said I do not have a lot of experience with GoW tourneys and therefore asked for some suggestions as to the format. So far this is what we have from the thread:

1. 5v5, First individual to earn MVP x3 Wins
2. 4v4 w/ Spotter on each team?
3. 4v4 GB swaps

With a suggestion from SuperPancho that the teams be assigned randomly to create a better sense of fairness for players that do not or cannot form their own team, which I agree is a good idea at this time.

Although to encourage ideas we can have multiple tournaments, multiple game types within tournaments (triathlon themed) or some other hybrid to make everything interesting. What do you all think?"	t5_2ruzg	True

""If you're anything like me then you like collecting all of the many weapon and armor skins.
GoW:J gave us so many that I rarely find myself using more than a few.
I'd like to suggest a pretty simple feature: the ""Random"" skin.

It would be a question mark [?] on the Weapon, Character, and Armor skin menus.
If selected, that specific skin would randomly choose one of your unlocked skins every new match.

For example, if you choose random armor skin but not character skin, your character would then stay the same every match but your armor skin would change.
You could do all three randoms if you so desire.
It would make your squads way more diverse and entice people to unlock more skins!

Thanks for reading, hope to get your support!""

Battlefield runs on dedicated servers, and now players have the option to rent their own server, for days, weeks, and even months. I think this is an awesome idea that Epic 
should implement for Gears of war 3. It would be amazing to be able to create servers, quick match of course, and tweak it to your liking. Gears of War has always been a great franchise
but where it always fell short was it's lack of customization. Halo and Battlefield have this down but no Gears. To be honest this really baffles me because Gears is so much fun
on its own that adding customization to it would increase its lifespan tenfold.

I mean who wouldn't want to see a Gnasher match on Thrashball with five Thrashball Coles versus five Thrashball Drones? 


Well this is what I think Epic should implement if they ever give us this awesome oppurtunity. 

First of all I think we should be able to Name our server and give it a description.

For example I would name my server ""Gears of War Classic""

Description: Gears of War 3 tweaked to play like the original. Loadout set to Lancer and Gnasher, No Stopping Power, Hammerburst as power weapon, and Custom Map cycles.

Firstly I would like to pick a map cycle and when choosing a map, I should be able to swap weapons as I see fit.
For example I don't like the digger replacing the sniper rifle on Jacinto so I would swap that out and make the boltok replace the Gorgon indefinetly on this map. 
I should be able to tweak everything map related for my server, weapons, map cycle, etc.

Then I would pick certain gametypes for my server to choose from, Team Deathmatch, Execution, Warzone and Guardian.
I should then be able to tweak certain settings to my liking for each gamemode.
For example, I would make Guardian 3 rounds, disable Leader Tac-Com and remove the Icon above the leaders head. 
For Team Deathmatch i would make it one round but give each team a lifepool of 40 and remove the man-up rule. 
Execution would be 5 second revive and again, no man-up rule.
Warzone I am somehwat unfamiliar with but I would remove the man up rule and make the bleed-out time 20 seconds.

Epic should give us a lot more customization, I wanna be able to tweak respawn times, lives, loadout and even ammo counts for each weapon. 
Personally I think the boomshot only needs two rounds should I should be able to set that so on my server I know that the boomshot is a viable option to rush for but it 
will not decimate a team during an Execution/Warzone match.

Also, Epic just giving us little things like setting weapons skins for each team and picking different leaders would be awesome. Being able to enable mutators for
these kind of matches would be great. I would like a silly match where everyone has pink lancers weating tophats and only being able to chainsaw each other. 
Heck I even love the Gnasher matches but I would remove the pistol completely and disable the active damage for maximum balance. 
Being able to completely control your server would make the game so good, and have it last so much longer. 

Think about it Epic, I would pay for Servers, and I'm sure a lot of other people would too. 

Until next time, peace.

Once again your friendly neighborhood mod is working on a way for people from our subreddit to post on a calendar when they would want to play. And people can comment or message the person saying that they will attend. Or just show up. 

This will increase the amount of Redditors that play together and make our sub-reddit even closer then it already is.


**Edit: Ok so I thought of a clever way to do it:**

I've created a google calendar for our sub-reddit. You will NEED a gmail account to participate in this. It doesn't take long just go to www.gmail.com and create an account then go to the calendars section and add gowreddit@gmail.com: I will accept the request and that will allow you to edit and look at the events available. Make your own events or join in on someone elses! This will make our community much more involved with each other and produce all-around more fun.


Thanks everyone I hope this works!

Hit me up with any ideas you guys have or renditions to my plan.


OOOOK. To answer any questions about the calendar: Yes you do need a gmail account. Yes you do need to sign in, click the calendars tab in the upper left corner. Then go to ""add a friends calendar"" at the bottom left area. Once you do that I get an email and accept it. After you do that you can see the calendar I have by clicking ""Gowreddit@gmail.com"" in the ""My calendars"" section. To have the ability to edit the calendar you are going to have to email me so I can add you to the list of people who can edit it. Your email WILL STAY DISCREET. I would never give it out to anyone.

I will be stopping at JITB tonight after I get off work tonight and again tomorrow before I go to work. How many codes I give away depends on how many I win.

Either way, to make this a little fun:

Tomorrow (10/8/11) at 7:30 pm PST, I will post a trivia thread.  I'll ask questions 1 by 1 and the first correct response wins the code.

I'm also an avid Halo player, and I loved the series, then Halo Reach came along and tried to change the formula that the series had always used, adding sprint, loadouts, etc. For me it looks like GOWJ might be the same thing, No DBNO, No Horde, quick nade toss, nades that see through walls, jumping of buildings. Even the weapons look like bad to me, for example the Markza looks stupid easy to use and over powered. It seems they are trying to make the game more casual to appeal to a wider audience, but are just ruining what we know as GOW multiplayer.	t5_2ruzg	True

and as a bonus at the end of your post for characters, give me and the rest of us one simple yet effective technique you use during multiplayer. 

-Campaign my favorite is Dom, He goes through the most shit out of any character and is the easiest to emotionally connect with and give you motivation to destroy those locust fools!

-COG multiplayer I like to play as Tai, the whole ancient warrior mentality thing is appealing to me, its unique and a strong warrior complex = badasses... ex. Leonidas, Achilles, Maximus from Gladiator. 

Locust multiplayer I play as Savage Kantus, I like the sounds they make is about it...and besides Myrrah they are a little harder to hit. 

TIP: On maps with a boomshot, even when I run out of ammo, I will sometimes hold onto it and when people try to charge, all I have to do is point it at them and they scatter like ants. Nothing thwarts the enemy like looking at those 4 little glowing lights on the front of it."	t5_2ruzg	True

I never did the campaign on insane, so that's what I'll be doing this time.

Wish me luck!"	t5_2ruzg	True
1364406476.0	1b4ep3	What sensitivity settings do you use?	pyrolm	13	0	47	Gears is a bit different since you can choose three different settings (look, target, and zoom). Currently I have them all at 15, which is probably still a bit low, but I was thinking maybe a mixture between the three might be better. What does everyone else use?	t5_2ruzg	True

When we went into the game, the skin isn't really ON the character, there's just a flat plaid texture pasted on where the character is. It doesn't move with him, it just kind of floats on him. I don't really know how else to describe it. Does that seem incredibly weird to anyone else?"	t5_2ruzg	True

I've been away for a while and I was thinking of coming back. Just wondering if the interest in 3 will dwindle when Judgement drops? Personally, I am having mixed feelings on Judgement, hints why my interest in 3 has increased. Thoughts?	t5_2ruzg	True
