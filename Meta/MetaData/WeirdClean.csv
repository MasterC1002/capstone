1372355347.0	1h6wto	Last week someone left a bag full of strange contents in the back of my taxi.	TaxiMan420	221	42	122	"Hi, never posted on reddit before but apparently this is the best place to put this sort of stuff. Here's the deal, I'm a taxi driver, and some guy left a bag in my back seat last week. Nothing weird about that, people leave stuff behind all the time, especially at weekends lol. Phones and bags are common, girls manage to leave their shoes behind somehow, we get the odd set of keys, the usual stuff. Usually they call looking for their stuff pretty quickly, a day later at most... and if not, we try to get in contact with them after a couple of days if it seems important. Or if it was a hot girl. Don't judge me.

OK, so, a bit of background. I picked this guy up from a cafe in town and took him to his hotel. He said he only needed to stop in for a few minutes and asked me to wait outside, which is fine. He left me a tenner and headed inside, which was nice, cos given the circumstances I would've been severely pissed off when he didn't come back out. It's happened before. I waited about 10 minutes, by which point they were starting to give me shit on the radio cos we don't have that many cars and blah blah blah. Not my fault, but that's a rant I'll not go into.

Anyway, got his number from the depot, tried calling him, and got no answer. Thought ""fuck this"", went into reception and told the girl I tried to get hold of him and that if he came down looking for me that I had other calls and had to go.

A bit later in the day I pick up 2 guys from town, and the guy in the back asks about the bag. ""What bag?"" Oh shit, the guy from the hotel was carrying that earlier and I completely forgot that he didn't lift it when he went in... whoops. It's been a good few hours since I left that guy off so I was pretty surprised that nothing came through about it. I tried calling him, and again, got no answer. Left him a message saying it'd be left into the depot and he could pick it up the following day... and now it's been over a week without hearing back from him. This is really strange.

One of our other drivers was telling me about a guy who left a shoe box full of money in a taxi years ago, and called up threatening to kill them if he didn't get it back. He was a drug dealer or something apparently, I don't have any more details on that or if it was a load of bullshit or what but anyway, it got me thinking, holy shit, what if the bag is full of money!! Fat chance, it felt practically empty, but we figured if he hasn't called in so long that it can't really be anything important. But on the off-chance that it might contain something cool, or at least hilarious (a bag with sex toys and bondage gear was left behind once and never claimed), we decided to take a look. We did try calling him again but this time it went straight to voicemail.

Inside the bag was another bag, one of those zip lock things. Which was weird enough by itself. But when we opened the bag up and pulled everything out, we found an assortment of weird/cool/baffling stuff in it. There was NOTHING else in the big bag, just this. What I wanna know is, what the hell was he doing with all this stuff? And if he was gonna put a bunch of stuff in a bag, why would he put it into one of those plastic things first?

Here is the bag before we opened it - [link](http://imgur.com/yGyaju4)

And here's the stuff that was sitting loose in the bag - [link](http://imgur.com/UqMyfU7)

There's a couple of old phone cards (one of which is battered to shit), a folding knife, a hammer-type-thing like the ones you see on buses, a black metal ""thing"" (no idea what else to call it), a compass, a badge holder, a pen and notepad, a key, a torch, and last but not least, a lock picking set. Yes, a fucking lock picking set. The notepad has a shopping list on it, there's nothing else on any of the pages apart from about half way through where there is random stuff written on one page. Can anyone make any sense of this? [link](http://imgur.com/182NnGe)

Also took a closer photo of the lock picks for anyone interested, they look pretty cool. [link](http://imgur.com/rSqj9ip)

There was also a beanie hat and a bandana, each wrapping up an assortment of their own treasures.  [link](http://imgur.com/o23MMUW)

Inside the hat there are 2 pairs of sunglasses, some small screwdrivers, **a fucking hypodermic needle** and a AA battery wrapped in tin foil. Yeah. This is where it crossed the line from ""what the fuck"" into ""what the fucking fuck"".

Inside the bandana...  [link](http://imgur.com/eTmOxWi)

Some disposable gloves, a memory stick, usb drive, old nokia phone and spare battery, and one of those cool radio earpieces like bouncers wear. It doesn't fit the phone though and there's no radio or anything so I have no idea what it's doing in here, then again I could say the same for most of the other shit.

Who the hell carries this sort of stuff? What's it all for? Why was it in a zip lock bag? And what's on the drives? I don't know what the deal with the purple one is, but I plugged the usb stick into my laptop and there's just one folder called ""p4x10"" and it asks for a password so I can't get into it.

Is this guy fucking with us or what? We've been kicking theories around since we opened it, the general consensus is that he's either james bond or some kind of nutcase. What do you guys think? He told me to wait a few minutes, never came back out, and now he's unreachable. What the fuck, reddit?"	t5_2qlia	True

1367255870.0	1dckdg	My Dad just got out of prison where he was on work release. In work release, inmates can't buy commercial energy drinks, so they made this drink. It's called a Sham, and you should try one.	LesliW	147	25	59	"The Sham

In a large tumbler or jar with a securable lid, add:

* 1 scoop of ice (maybe a cup)
* 5-7 scoops of instant coffee
* 1/2 can (or a little more) of Coca-Cola or Dr. Pepper
* About 6-12 oz of some sort of fruit drink. My dad has tried all of the following:

* * A packet of Crystal Light or other instant fruit drink (Adding water is optional.)
* * Sun-Kist
* * Hawaiian Punch (This if my favorite.)
* * Gatorade
* * Any flavor of Kool-aid

Close the lid and shake it until everything is mixed and dissolved. It will make a lot of foam, so be prepared. 

BTW: You may be tempted to leave out the fruit drink based on the fact that it sounds too weird. Don't do it. If you do, the whole thing will be disgustingly bitter. And anyway, you're losing authenticity and all that. If you are sensitive to bitter tastes, add more fruit drink and fewer scoops of coffee. 

A few notes:

1. The first taste will make you grimace. I promise. Be brave and take a second sip. It will be weirdly addictive by sip number three. 

2. This recipe is born out of the creativity of men with limited resources. This being said, you will likely never make two Shams that are exactly alike. Try different combinations for fun.

3. If you're unfamiliar with prison and are wondering where they get the ingredients, it works sort of like this: prison food is bad. If you are lucky and have family that will send you money, or can get on work release and earn a little bit, you can buy packaged junk food and drinks in a store there. As you can imagine, it depends on where you are as to what they have available in the store. 

That's all! Go try it and let me know how it goes. "	t5_2qlia	True

I'm really curious.	rsong965	137	16	35	"Thanks to JabasMyBitch, I sent it to a better category (r/AskReddit) and it received a lot of good and/or funny answers.  Here is the link: [Recliner family](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xpndn/help_ive_seen_an_unusual_family_sleeping/) 

I met this kid in a news broadcasting class that I took in high school.  I was a broadcaster and he was an a/v guy.  He was pretty shy and people made fun of him but he was actually pretty cool and funny.  He asked me if I wanted to chill this one weekend and I said ""cool"" and I went to go sleep over his house.  

Everything was fairly normal.  We played cards for about 3 hours, which I thought was weird.  I usually partied and went places on the weekends but this kid was having a blast just playing cards with me, so I didn't want to be a dick and say, ""let's go somewhere this is boring"".  

At around 10:30pm, his mom came into the friends room and said it was time to go to bed.  I figured she would lead me to a guest bedroom since they had a pretty big house and beds and stuff.  But she led me to this room with about 4 recliners.  They were lined up against the wall to where if the chairs were reclined, it would barely touch the wall.  There was also a small wardrobe with pillows and blankets.  She handed me a pillow and blanket and said I could have the recliner near the window.  
First I was thinking, ""wtf"" but then I just laid down when suddenly the mom, dad and the friend came in and took their spots on the recliner to go to sleep.  I was pretty fucking weirded out at that point and couldn't sleep all night.  I contemplated calling my dad to pick me up but I guess part of me was curious to see if they were serious or not.  

Yes, they were serious.  They slept all the way till about 7:00am.  I waited till they got up first.  I heard the sound of the recliner folding back up as I had my eyes closed.  Then about 10 minutes later I went out into the kitchen.

We ate a good breakfast of sausage and eggs with toast.  I was burning inside with curiosity and I wanted to ask them why they slept in recliners but I didn't want to offend them.  This was a while ago but I totally regret not asking them because every now and then I still wonder why they all slept in recliners.  I mean, they had beds in their bedrooms and everything.  Everything looked normal except for that one room.  Was it a tradition passed down from generation to generation?  If it was a tradition, then the mom had to have convinced the dad that this was acceptable or vice versa.  Did one of the parents have a serious accident that left them sleeping upright and the other family members slept in the same way as a show of unity? Were they afraid I was going to steal something?  

I never told any of my friends or classmates about this because I didn't want this kid to get made fun of or for him to hate me.  I also just didn't want to think about it because it was too weird.  But much time has passed and I actually thought of this randomly and asked some friends about it who indeed thought it was weird.  They have not heard of anyone doing this.  

Does anybody's family out there do this or do you know anybody that does?

What are the reasons why you or they do this?

Thanks.  It would really help close a small chapter in my life"	t5_2qlia	True

Looking west towards the horizon, a large red crescent shaped light sort of just hovered over very low in the horizon. I live on the Oregon coast, and have NEVER seen anything like this. 

It loomed in the sky very low on the horizon for quite some time. IT gave of a steady flouresent glow unlike anything I've seen before. It was in the shape of a nike swoosh almost, that is the shape that best describes it. After a while it looked like it started to 'bleed' light downwards, and eventually turned into a glowing red orb and disappeared. 

Edit: I guess I should mention that I at first thought it was just the moon, so I looked around, and the moon was above me. I thought I had specified the time, since I posted this just after it had happened.
It was about 11:20 PM. It was slightly cloudy, but mostly clear. It occurred low on the horizon. The moon was a sliver, maybe 1/4 of it visible.
Has anyone ever seen/heard of anything like this? Very odd and quite disturbing."	t5_2qlia	True

However at the time of the calls I did some internet searching and could find no clues.  To get to the point last summer around late august I began receiving phone calls from a number that came up on my phone as 'Death'.  It came up as if the contact was saved in my phone already but I had no entry of 'Death"" in my contacts.  When I looked at the number of the missed call from 'Death' it was my own.  However when I would attempt to call it back it just gave me a busy tone, not going to voicemail like it would if i dialed my own number out individually.  These calls, probably 7 or 8 of them in total, came between the hours of Midnight and 4 a.m.  I was never awake during them, or if i was i never saw the calls until they were missed.  I never got a voicemail or anything else.  Has anyone ever heard of something like this our have ideas? "	t5_2qlia	True

1354721684.0	14bqht	Ladies and gentlemen gather round, let me tell you the story of the shitapiller.	withabeard	59	30	10	"Ah - well children, come around the campfire and let me tell you the, sadly true, tale of the shitapiller.

Once upon a time a cleaner was doing their daily rounds, hoovering offices, wiping desks emptying bins and mopping the toilets.

Little did they know, a new client had rented an office in the building. This client had a particularly disgruntled member of staff. Upon entering the toilets the cleaner noticed there was shit smeared all up the wall and down behind the sanitory bin.

Yes children, this is the ladies convenience.

The cleaner thought this most peculiar but decided to be a positive worker and clear it up. Maybe some poor old dear was feeling ill and had an unfortunate accident, the type normally reserved for drug addled festival goers in port-a-loos.

Slightly scarred by this incident, but otherwise unharmed, the cleaner finished their rounds and went home to a strong scotch. Something nice to end a shitty day at work.

The very next day the cleaner, though this whole episode had ended, started doing their usual round. Nothing out of the ordinary in any of the offices, how lovely.

Come the last job of the night the cleaner takes a deep breath and walks into the ladies loo.

Wonderful thought the cleaner, no shit on the walls. While wiping round the cleaner begins to develop a sense of dread, all their senses tingling. It seems today, instead of smearing shit up the wall there were little carefully rolled balls of shit lined up on the windowsill. But the worst is yet to come.

At the end of the carefully arranged row of balls is a little caerfully rolled and carved caterpillar, of shit. The shitapiller. Smiling face and poked out eyes glaring at the cleaner.

""Enough of this, I'm not payed enough to deal with such a terrible monster."" The cleaner hurridly leaves the building.

The next day the cleaner reports their newly discovered creature of the dank to to management. That evening on their rounds they are accompanited. Least the horrid monster come out again. Nothing, no sign of the shitapiller anywhere.

Over the next few days nothing in the toilet changes expect for a sign advising the creator of the shitapiller that this is not acceptable behaviour. Many who witnesses the sign thought it a somewhat redundant statement, smearing shit on the walls is unnaceptable, that's just good manners.

But someone, somewhere, took heed of the signs.

Come friday evening, the last day of the week the cleaner enters the toilet, no longer afraid. 

The walls, floor ceiling, just about everything smothered in shit. Clearly the creator of the shitapiller has been yet again posessed by the demon inside. This time however they have clearly had a remorseful moment and decided to smoosh the shitapiller into oblivion. All over the fucking place.

Yes dear children, this is where I work. In this quiet, friendly and generally lovely office block. Lurks the debodied soul of the shitapiller.

I lost my wallet yesterday after a trip to the store and I have no recollection of putting it anywhere. I couldn't find it this morning before going to set, and I even came home on lunch and tore apart my apartment looking for it. 

When I got home from work I spent another two hours looking. Everywhere I looked I didn't find it. I always put it on my desk so naturally I look there thoroughly. 

I just got up to grab a glass of water and I set it down on my desk before going to bed and wouldn't ya know...my wallet is right there on my desk. 

I woke up my girlfriend (who had also searched for me today) to show her and tell her. She agreed that it was impossible that it was there earlier as we both looked and looked and looked. 

Do I have a magic wallet? Or did I just train it to find it's way home? "	t5_2qlia	True

My aunt, uncle and cousins are visiting me for a few days (they usually do just after Christmas), and they brought their dog, Kevin — a foxhound-beagle mix — with them.

Kevin is extremely dependent on my uncle and bawls pitifully at the front door for a while whenever said uncle leaves the house without him. After answering the doorbell and finding no one there, I realized that Kevin's baying and howling must occasionally be hitting just the right frequency to vibrate a metal contact or activate some sound-sensitive receptor (that's my theory, anyway). It only happens when Kevin's barking at the door, and only affects the upstairs doorbell, not the downstairs.

1328178424.0	p7jpp	Time shift? -actual event	Sieglind	15	3	1	"The event I'm about to describe happened about 25 years ago. I'm not posting this to find the answer, because I don't think there is one. However, I do like to know if other people experienced a similar event.

Right, so what happened?

Me and a large part of my family were travelling from The Netherlands to Antibes in the south of France for our summer holidays. We took the route via Germany and Switzerland, uisng the Gothard Tunnel in the Alps to pass through to the French Rivièra.

We were travelling with 3 cars.
Me and my gf in the first, my brother, his gf and my niece in car #2 and my sister and her kids in the 3rd.

At our last stop in Germany we all decided to refuel at the fuel station that is closest to the tunnel entrance. This fuel station is about 3 kilometers away from said entrance.

Me and my gf were the first to arrive. I started refuelling, went inside, paid, got some snacks and walked back to my car.
As I did, I saw my brother pulling into the station. I walked up to him, said hi, talked a bit and walked back to my car.

When me and my gf drove off I could see him starting to refuel.

After a few minutes we arrived at the tunnel.
A few things you should know about that tunnel:
Cars are only allowed to pass it in batches. Once a batch goes in (20 cars or so) it is not allowed to overtake others and there's a very strict speed limit. In other words: the batch comes out of the tunnel in the same order in went in.

When we arrived at the tunnel we were one of the last few cars to make this (only) batch complete. So only after a few minutes we were allowed in.  As soon as we cleared the tunnel I hit the gas and took a steady pace of 150km/hr.

After a few minutes my girlfriend went totally ape.
At first I had no clue why and then I saw it...we were overtaking my brother's car....

While we did I saw his face and that of my nieces..total awe..

Using gestures (we had no mobiles back then) we decided to pull over.
We stopped and walked over to each other in total shock as we all felt there was something very weird going on.

My brother told me that after I left the fuel station they remained there for at least another 15 minutes. He was still fuelling, had to pay, my niece went of to the bathrooms and my brother refilled his coolant (his radiator had a small leak).

So...
1) there was no way that he could have passed me in the 3 to 4 minutes it took me to get to the tunnel entrance
2) I was last to complete the first and only batch of cars and he wasn't there
3) the tunnel itself does not allow for overtaking, nor did it actually happen

Yet, we overtook him only minutes after clearing the tunnel.

As you understand this story comes up at every family reunion ad nauseum.

We tried to analyse this to death and went over every possible option that could explain this weird event, but with no success.
