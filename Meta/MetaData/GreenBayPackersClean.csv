1355755102.0	14zsxj	I need to get something off my chest.	jobeavs	375	80	52	"Full disclosure.  I used to be a Bears fan, but after this week's game, I have switched my allegiance to the great and mighty Packers because I have fallen in lust with my new favorite player.  With a smooth and calm demeanor, Aaron Rodgers picks apart defense like a mule eating an apple.  Cool under fire and with a charisma that jumps off the tv screen, Aaron Rodgers exemplifies what it means to be a winner, an MVP, nay, THE GREATEST PLAYER IN NFL HISTORY.  When he effortlessly launches a TD pass I have to discount double check my pants to make sure my Packer boner doesn't give me away to my nefarious Bear fan comrades.

Another reason for my switch was my utter disgust with my crybaby quarterback.  If there's anything I can't stand in a football player, it is sulkiness.  It makes me yearn for Tebow madness to descend onto Chicago.  What this city needs is a college style option offense run by a great and selfless human being.  It also needs the kind of accuracy that only a Tim Tebow can bring to the table.  He has everything that Jay Cutler does not, and that is intangibles.  He's just a winner.  He just wins.  Cutler just pouts and complains.  Give me Tebow Time in Chicago and they will finally have a chance to compete against the greatest franchise in sports history.

1367009783.0	1d6f2f	Aaron Rodgers is the Greatest QB in the League and Big Ben is vastly inferior	VCOMAC	211	36	52	"This should be patently obvious to even the untrained eye, but there are fools out there who believe that by virtue of his larger number of superbowl rings, Big Ben is superior. They are flat out wrong. Not even getting into Roethlisberger's various character issues (by which I mean the fact that he is a rapist), Aaron Rodgers is in all ways superior to him.

For starters, Rodgers plays all of the games every season. Roethlisberger hasn't played a full season in years, due to injuries and suspensions for raping women. And it isn't like Rodgers isn't getting hit; last year he got sacked a league leading 51 times (ouch), and he still played every game. He was sacked over 20 times more than Ben and Rodgers just did not give a single fuck. That is why he is a great quarter back.

And I havent even talked about his passing. Although to be fair what is there to say that hasnt already been said. The list of NFL records on his wikipedia page more than speaks for itself, but allow me to rehash a little of the highlights

Single season QB Passer Rating record (122.5)

Highest career passer rating in regular season with a minimum of 1,500 passing attempts (104.9)

Most games with a passer rating of over 110.0 (12) and 100.0 (13) in a season.

Most consecutive games with a passer rating of over 100.0 (12) and 110.0 (11)

Highest career completion percentage in regular season (65.7%)

Most passing yards by a quarterback in their first playoff game (423)

Only quarterback in history post over 400 yards passing, 4 passing touchdowns, and 2 rushing touchdowns in one game.

Best touchdown to interception ratio in NFL history.

Tied NFL record for most consecutive games with at least two touchdown passes (13).

Tied NFL record for most consecutive playoff games with at least 3 touchdown passes (3).

I think that the highest touchdown to interception rating thing is perhaps the best indicator of how amazing a player Rodgers is. On the other hand Big Ben's records? All about how he was really young when he won big. He was the youngest qb to ever reach x wins, or to win a superbowl, or whatever. As if he was the winning factor in the equation, instead of just a decent QB surrounded by amazing talent.

I could go on, but really, this has proved my point. Aaron Rodgers is the greatest current QB, and at only 29 could very feasibly have another good 8-12 years of play in him. Ben Roethlisberger is a decent QB who is nearing the end of his career."	t5_2qqd2	True

1353519916.0	13kq3t	Stat of the week: Last Sunday's victory over the Lions marked Casey Hayward's second game this season where he allowed an NFL rating of 0.0 on passes targeted to his coverage	Danzeru	162	18	33	"**WEEK 11**

I posted a stat about Cobb's rushing last week and am looking to make this a weekly post on this sub if there is interest.

Back to number 29. Our 2nd round pick rookie was on the field for all 75 defensive snaps and was thrown at 7 times which was the most of any Packer defender. The defense was on for a significant portion of the game with GB only having 65 offensive snaps.

He got his hands on 4 of these balls, intercepting one of them and batting down the other 3. That's over 50% of targets where he makes a play for the ball, not content with only using positioning to halt the passing game, this upcoming defender is definitely a playmaker.

Hayward only allowed a single completion all game to Tony Scheffler for 6 yards. 6 total yards over 75 snaps against the offense putting up the most yards/game average in the NFL (307). Let that sink in.

Titus Young and Megatron were both made non factors whenever Casey was involved in the coverage. When you can hold one of the best skill position players in the NFL to zero yards in a game while in your rookie year then you've clearly got something going.

Now on his 5th interception in 11 games, #29 is making a statement and is a key piece in our exciting up tempo defense under Capers. To put perspective on this, I think it took Woodson 15 games to record 4 interceptions which is still a fantastic record. 

Opposing QBs now have an average of 28.5 passer rating when throwing at Hayward, the lowest of *any* NFL CB. This guy is a hard worker and when put on the spot, in a position where he *needs* to make plays, he does his job and significantly more.

All in all, TT delivered once again and it's been exciting watching this kid play.

Submerge25	136	8	2	"&gt;From Elias: Aaron Rodgers threw only one touchdown pass in the Packers' 23-14 win over the Vikings, but it was a record breaker. Rodgers' 32-yard pass to James Jones in the first quarter extended his streak to 35 consecutive games at Lambeau Field with a TD pass. That's the longest such streak at any venue in NFL history, breaking the record that Johnny Unitas set at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore from 1956 to 1962. It's of historical interest that the record, prior to Unitas, was held by Sid Luckman of the Bears, who threw a touchdown pass in 16 straight games at ... wait for it ... Wrigley Field.

Not a Packer fan worried about their team's fate.
Lombardis were stored in their cases with care,
In hopes that St. Rodgers would put one more there. 

The Bears were all nestled in Appleton's beds,
While delusions of victory danced in their heads.
My folks wearing cheeseheads, to them very clear,
Knew Sunday would bring us all one more win near. 

And on Lambeau Field, there awaited a scene.
Soon seats would be shimmering with gold and with green.
With gates open wide, fans ready to cheer,
With plump tasty bratwurst, and six dollar beer.
The Packers would win in the rain, sleet, or snow,
For now the moon shone on calm tundra below. 

From the couch I awoke, to ESPN,
Calling Tebow a miracle, oh man, not again.
A hyped-up QB, it's really quite odd.
We all know the real thing's our dear St. A-Rod. 

We bask in his glory and fill up the stands,
To watch coach McCarthy give sterling commands:
""On Driver, on Matthews, on Jordy, on Woodson,
On Jennings, on Crosby, on Finley, and Clifton!
Throwing and running, not dropping the ball,
Swift interceptions, this team does it all!"" 

And then, in a twinkling, from a man down south,
Mumbling and grumbling with lies from the mouth:
""Your 13 and 1 season is one big fluke,
Your green and gold's ugly, it just makes me puke."" 

But we must feel sorry for the whole Windy City,
We'd be steamed too, if our team were so shameful.
They watch once again as their Bears take a dive,
Left forever living in 1985. 

""U mad bro?"" I shouted, ""just 'cause your team's stodgy?""
""Perhaps you'd pass one more time to our guy Raji?""
""You know, the high-jumper with a big, round belly,
That shook when he danced like a bowl full of jelly?"" 

But St. Rodgers swooped in like Tramon on a pick,
""Never mind him,"" he said, ""He's just being a difficult person.""
""Tomorrow with family, you'll chug beer and see,
Bears thrown to the curb, like brown Christmas trees."" 

""The Niners, the Pats, the Saints, and the 'Boys?
Soon broken and trashed like cheap children's toys.
God's on Tebow's side? That argument's weak,
Five words: Ice Bowl, Starr's quarterback sneak!"" 

As gameday drew near, he left to prepare,
To give touchdown gifts, spiraling through the air.
He exclaimed, after I had wished him good luck:
""Merry Christmas to all! The Bears still suck!""

For years, the Pack has been my second favorite NFL team; the history, the players, and the GB-SF rivalry games we've had have influenced my love of football.

I treasure our rivalry, and while there's no one I love to hate more, I would never want to see you lose other than fair and square. Right now, there's a circlejerk of hatred flying around r/ChiBears, and everyone's saying you ""deserved"" this. I just wanted to pop in and say, no, no you didn't, and that not all Bears fans are ignorant blowhards. Personally, I love (to hate) you guys. There's no better rivalry in the league.

Every sports news analyst last year praised us as unbeatable. Said Rodgers was the best in history. We soaked it in, and it felt amazing.

Then we lost in the playoffs. Then we lost our season opener. Now everyone is acting like we are a broken team. The last 2 real games we've played have been against the team who won the superbowl, and the team who SHOULDA won the superbowl.

Everyone, please take a deep breath, let our boys get into a rhythm, and save the panicking for if we lose to the bears."	t5_2qqd2	True

I'm sure the fact that the Pack can actually *clinch* your at-this-point-pretty-much-guaranteed-anyway playoff berth is enough impetus for them to give it their all against the Lions, but wanted to let you know (since it's a very rare and special thing) that you will have the support of a million screaming Superfans tomorrow afternoon.

That is all. Bear down, Packer fans! Er, 'Go Pack Go'. Whatever it is. Kill those kittens!

&gt; First of all, I want to thank all of you for making the r/GreenBayPackers the best NFL subreddit.  You guys have fueled r/GreenBayPackers, and you have truly driven the subreddit to be something great.  I am surprised we have passed the 4,000 subscriber milestone already.  In just 7 months, [we doubled our subscribers](http://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBayPackers/comments/muvcp/we_just_broke_the_2000_subscriber_barrier/).  Despite being the [largest subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/tat3h/i_made_a_bar_graph_ranking_nfl_subreddits_by_of/), we have experienced few issues or problems in the community, which I believe just goes to show what the attitude and integrity of Packer fans everywhere is.    


**NEW Design**
&gt; As a way to celebrate breaking the 4,000th subscriber barrier, we have completely given the subreddit a much needed facelift.  And by ""we"", I mean [PhoenixAvenger](http://www.reddit.com/user/PhoenixAvenger)!  He is a fellow Packer fan who took over what was a long overdue project that failed to get off the ground and made it all happen by himself.  So to him we owe a big thanks!


**NEW Moderator**
&gt; With the subreddit seemingly adding dozens of new subscribers a day, we are preparing for a big 2012 Packer season.  Two moderators just isn't enough these days. And in order to deliver a much better Packer reddit experience, we've added PhoenixAvenger as a moderator to help us in the graphics/design department of the subreddit.  So please welcome him to the modteam!


**NEW Features**
&gt;New additions to the subreddit includes a full 2012 Packer Schedule and NFC North Standings which will update each week of the season with current scores and standings.  


**NEW Flair**
&gt; One thing worth noting is that I know many of you have messaged me in regards to getting a specific flair.  I apologize for not responding to your requests in a timely fashion, but I am proud to announce that we have every number added to the flair so no one will be left out, past or present!


Once again, thank you. If you guys have any questions or comments, do not hesitate to let TJ11240, PhoenixAvenger, or I know!

1349920812.0	11acc8	Interesting theory on Pack's offensive woes	norseman23	83	12	40	"Was listening to Cowherd at work this morning and thought his theory was pretty spot on.

When a team has a season like the Packers last year, every other team adapts to you during the offseason.  Most offenses try to mimic you, but most importantly defenses work all off season on how to stop you and every other offense that is now trying to be like you.  Unlike other teams like the Patriots, the Packers did nothing to stop teams from adapting to them.

Look at the Patriots.  One year they shred everyone by throwing non-stop cut option routes to welker.  Next year, they start airing it deep non-stop (helps when you have moss).  Then they start jamming TE's down everyone's throat.  Now they no huddle and run n' gun.  Point is, they never let anyone adapt to their play style because they are constantly changing it up every single year.

The Packers didn't do that.  Now teams worked on dropping 6-7 skilled DB's and then pass rush the QB and Rodgers no longer has his wide open WR's 15-30 yards downfield every play nor does he have any time to try to throw them open.  But they are still trying to do that same thing that they were doing last year.  

Not my original theory, it was Cowherd's but I thought it had a lot of merit to it and went at least a little bit deeper other than the usual, ""o-line sucks"", ""lost Philbin"", etc"	t5_2qqd2	True

(save your stat postings. I'm arguing that he's underperforming. When's the last time he played ""lights out""?)

Honestly, I don't care how much potential he has. I'm tired of hearing how he's just immature and young. I'm sick to death of watching him whiff on blocks, drop passes, and stumble and fall all over the field like some uncoordinated clutz when he DOES hang onto the ball.

It's put up or shut up time.

[edit] Please stop with the ""he's not worth anything"" comments. I'm saying try to trade him first vs cutting him outright. I realize he's not performing well, hence the post.

[edit 2] Yep, I agree that defenses need to account for him. But let's not mistake 2012 Finley for 2008 Finley. He created mismatches because he was a TIGHT END being covered by LineBackers and Safeties. We split him out as a wide receiver now, and he's covered by a corner + line backer and/or safety. He was successful against 2-deep coverages because he could attack the middle of the field. When split out he loses the advantage. He's NOT a wide receiver. We'd be better off with an average well-rounded TE that can BLOCK as well as drop balls. 

[edit 3] I've been a defender of Finley this entire time. Nothing changes the fact that he's not playing well.

This year our draft picks Nick Perry (pre-injury), Jerel Worthy, Casey Hayward, Mike Daniels, and Jerron McMillian all received major playing time. During critical parts of critical games.

Our draft picks from 2011, Derek Sherrod, Randall Cobb, Alex Green, Davon House, DJ Williams, and DJ Smith all received the same treatment.

We don't have the tough as nails players or the unintimidated assholes that give a team the edge you need, particularly in the playoffs (I'd put Woodson in that category, but he's getting old).  Look at our top/best draft picks in recent years.  They're talented and athletic, but they're finesse players.  Cobb and Hayward come to mind.

First play, Jordy to the left, Jones to the right, Finley in motion and settles in the backfield, where Lacy waits.  Rodgers fakes the hand-off, Lacy picks up a block, Rodgers lobs the ball to a sprinting Jordy Nelson.  Touchdown on the very first play, on a play-action pass, catching the safety on the fake.

First thing 49ers fans think: ""So much for thinking we'll survive without Dashon Goldson.""

First thing Packers fans think: ""Fuck it!  We *still* don't need a running game!""

1363524870.0	1agmt9	My Prediction:  Packers vs Vikings in Wild Card game.	creamy_afterbirth	93	36	25	"Greg Jennings, obviously, misses most of the regular season due to injury.  He spends a small fortune on doctors while he tries to come back.  None of it works.  The season ends and Jennings still isn’t back.  The Vikings take the division and are slate to play the Packers at home.  Jennings thinks, “I just gotta return for this game.  If only I could touch Purple Jesus’s jock strap… maybe that could heal me.”  As Peterson undresses  from a long practice, Jennings grabs Peterson’s ass before the jock strap is removed.  Peterson whips around and says, “My team mate, because you had faith, you shall play this game.”

Two days before the game expectations are met and the Metrodome collapses for no reason whatsoever.  The NFL scrambles  to find a replacement venue and settles on Lambeau.  Frazier asks Pfeterson, “You can heal Jennings but you won’t fix the Metrodom?”  Peterson responds, “Do you really want to waste a miracle on the fucking Metrodome?” 

The day of the game most of the Vikings players are sick.  Their wives cooked them a big traditional Minnesota dinner.  Since Minnesota cuisine is so awful the players resorted to licking each other’s buttholes to get the taste out of their mouths.  As a result they contacted minor cases of e coli.  Some of the o-line can’t even play because they licked more butthole than most and got sicker than most.

Throughout the game the Packers repeatedly hold the Vikings to field goals.  But like water was turned into wine, Purple Jesus turns 3 points into 7 with a wave of his hand.  The Packers and Vikings are neck and neck the whole game, trading score for score.  In the 3rd quarter as Ponder drops back to pass, Clay crushes the defender and his helmet comes off.  No matter.  He whips his hair around Ponder and cuts him in half like Kabuki Quantum Fighter.

“Can you heal him?” Frazier asks Peterson.  “Do you really want to waste a miracle on Christian fucking Ponder?”  Until this time, Cassel was content to drool on himself while warming the bench.  “Cassel!  We need  you to play!”, the Frazier hollers.  “What are we playing?” Cassel asks.  Pleadingly the Frazier looks at Peterson.  Peterson merely shakes his head no.

Some how some way the Vikings hold off the Packers.  Two minutes are left in the 4th, Packers down by 7.  Rodgers drives down and places the Packers on the goal line.  Rajii and Kuhn are now in.  The ball is snapped, and a huge whole is opened up by our o-line.  Such a thing has never happened before and Raji, Kuhn’s lead blocker is stunned for a moment.  Kuhn runs into Raji and almost butt fumbles.  Almost.  Gaining a head of steam Raji crashes through the hole just as Allen appears.  Raji hits Allen so hard he knocks the inbred redneck out of him.  Kuhn scores with :28 left in the game.  “Even Crosby can make this kick and send us into overtime McCarthy thinks.”  Crosby can’t.  Packers are down by 1 and kick off.

With less than half a minute remaining, and a  1 point lead the Vikings bring the ball out of the end zone.  They’re ecstatic.  They’re about to win this game.  With :24 seconds left Cassel has the ball snapped and kneels down.  Game over.  But wait.  Cassel rushes everyone back to the line to get off another play.  “WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!” Frazier screams.  Such a crazy play causes chaos amongst the players.  Jennings is somehow lined up against Clay.  “Fuck that! I’m not getting hit like that!” Jennings thinks as the ball is snapped.  He dives out of the way and lets Clay hone in on Cassel.  Cassel scrambles east and west trying to find a receiver, daylight, anything.  “Just throw it  away!  Take a tackle!  Anything!” Frazier screams.  Cassel elects for anything.  As he zigs and zags he slowly backs to the endzone.  Cassel makes it to his own endzone, trips and Clay lands on him.  Packers win by 1.

Fans and Packers storm the field in glee.  They hoist Clay, Jennings and Cassel on their shoulders.  Jennings looks down, rips off his Vikings jersey to reveal a Packers jersey .  He was wearing it  the whole time.  Cassel drools down on his carriers and rips off his Vikings jersey to reveal a Potato jersey.  He was retarded the whole time.

1357655783.0	166n89	This would be considered sacrilegious among us Viking fans, but....	cojack777	69	10	62	"IF Adrian Peterson does not get MVP (and he should), 

then Aaron Rodgers should absolutely should get the award.  Rodgers does so much for his team and has outplayed Manning this year.  

Rodgers: 39 TD, 8 INT, 4295 yds, 108 QB rating
Manning: 37 TD, 11 INT, 4659 yds, 105.8 QB rating

Add on a less effective defense and inferior offensive line: it becomes clear that Rodgers has bested Manning this year in terms of statistics and provides just as much (if not more) value than ol' number 18.  

I think that people are all over Manning because he has made such a large comeback from serious neck injury.  This doesn't make him the MVP though; it only merits Comeback Player of the Year.  Manning joined a team that made it to the divisional round of the playoffs last year WITHOUT him!
