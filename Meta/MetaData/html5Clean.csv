1306823982.0	ho1sb	I made a free, Osmos-inspired game in HTML5. Enjoy! (And be cruel in the comments)	BHSPitMonkey	79	10	48	"Here's what you came for:

* [Link to hosted version](http://stepheneisenhauer.com/demos/browsmos/) (works in any modern browser)
* [Google Web Store link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/detail/kmijdbjgikpiadlbldnmldfgfepigkip) (free; game fully installs locally)

The gameplay is inspired heavily (and blatantly!) by [Osmos](http://www.hemispheregames.com/osmos/).

Controls and objective are explained when you open the game. Be sure to take advantage of the scroll wheel to zoom out!

This is my latest foray into HTML5; feel free to check out some of my [others](http://stepheneisenhauer.com/html5).

Please push Google and Apple!	colordrops	46	14	27	"Everyone talks about how native apps will disappear and HTML5 will be the future.  The thing is, there is no technical reason why this couldn't be the case now.  There is a business reason:  It is not in Google or Apple's self-interest to create a viable HTML5 platform for mobile.  This would kill their app stores, and therefor their walled gardens.  Apple is much more against this than Google.

In order for HTML5 to subsume (most) native apps, you need the a minimum of the following:

**Standards Implemention**

* graphics hardware acceleration
* application caching (to run the app offline)
* local data
* web sockets and server-sent events for smooth networking

**Platform Implementation**

* Web apps to be treated as first-class citizens, meaning they get an icon on the mobile app-launcher and/or desktop
* Web apps executing in a frameless browser to have the same feel as a native app
* allowing web apps to be part of the marketplace (iOS App Store and Google Play Marketplace)

These things are not hard to implement at all, and most of the pieces already exist.  But Google and Apple are not going to give this to you all until they have no choice competitively.

Google ChromeOS already implements these things (with some problems, admittedly), because Google has nothing to lose and everything to gain with a strong HTML5 implementation on the desktop.

I can't wait for a REAL HTML5 implementation on mobile.  My goal with this post is awareness of the lack of a real HTML5 solution, which is holding back its adoption.

Perhaps someone could think of a campaign name to bring more awareness to this problem."	t5_2r7u2	True

I made this originally as an easy way to get a voice chat going in video games without built-in voice-chat support. Other methods require exchanging usernames, hosting servers, making accounts, installing programs, etc.

Right now I'm using the excellent and well-documented [WebRTC library made by Muaz Khan](https://webrtc-experiment.appspot.com/) and performance is great. Node.js in the back, deployed on Heroku. Firebase is used as the signaling server, although it wouldn't be difficult to switch to Socket.io via Websockets from what I've read.

Please let me know what you think. It's supposed to by extremely simple and straight-forward.

The two major issues on my mind now are:

* Improving the audio controls. Right now, if you ""unmute"" your own mic you'll hear an echo of yourself. I'd like to disable the mute/unmute altogether with some kind of custom buttons so confusing options aren't available.
* Occasionally there are two people who can't hear each other (although everyone else can hear each other and both of them). This probably has to do with the STUN server being unable to ""punch a hole"" in one firewall/router pair. All of that stuff is a huge mystery to me, though, so I'd appreciate any help or guidance on the issue.

After a few more improvements I'm planning on posting this to /r/leagueoflegends, which is the game that originally inspired the project."	t5_2r7u2	True

We also added in networked multiplayer, so you don't always have to face the AI.

Thanks to HTML5, it'll run in your browser, phone, or tablet -- so you can play others who are on their desktops from your phone.

**Here's the link: http://slime.clay.io**

It's the first game we've developed for our HTML5 game platform: http://clay.io - basically we're trying to develop ""Steam for HTML5"". 

We're writing a few blog posts about the process (and posted our code on GitHub), so if you're curious you can check that out here: http://blog.clay.io/writing-a-multiplayer-game-with-html5s-canvas

We definitely want your feedback too on how we can improve both the game and platform, so shoot."	t5_2r7u2	True

Let me know if you have any problems getting it running.

I'm creating something similar in canvas, which you can see [here](http://ehsankia.com/cjs/18), but as you can see, the top needs to be tucked under right side.

The only way I can think of is using some complex masking, where I mask the entirety of the left side from the right side, but that would probably require using hidden canvases, and I'm not quite sure if it'd work anyway.

Flash developer here that has moved into HTML5, CSS3, and javascript/jquery/other libraries.

While the above toolset can handle a lot of the interactive features flash and actionscript did, I've yet to find a really solid replacement for straight up animation. 

Specifically, I need to be able to animate non-interactive vector graphics for up to a period of 12 minutes while synced to an audio track. The end result could be anything from code to an embedded video using the &lt;video&gt; tag. 

Please examine the below list of what I've found so far, and let me know if I've overlooked any. 

Also, please let me know if you've personally used any of the below, what was good, what was bad, and if you think any are an applicable tool for my needs.

Thanks!

[edit] I forgot to mention that the company I work for would like to find something capable of moving beyond just a movie export in order to maintain the vector graphics integrity (specifically for changing resolutions in the mobile world), as well as possibly adding interactivity to the animations at some point.

**Hype**

* mac only

* $49.99

* audio not supported, but there's a somewhat reliable workaround

* exports code, has own javascript library

**Toon Boom**

* $499.00

* True animation software

* can import .swfs

* exports as flash movie, .swf, or .mov

**KoolMoves**

* $49.00

* flash authoring tool

* HTML5 export

* not a lot of other info

**sencha animator**

* $99

* CSS based, outputs code

**Radi**

* $199

* Mac only

* uses &lt;video&gt; or &lt;canvas&gt;

* vector

* does audio

**Animatable**

* browser based

* free

* not released yet

1345259231.0	yeu53	My WIP HTML5 game lags like hell for Windows users with GPU acceleration - yet runs perfectly without it. Any ideas?	z0w0	12	2	7	"My work in progress game is playable [here](http://z0w0.me/labs/atomica) and the code is [here](https://github.com/z0w0/atomica). 

I've asked about 10 people to test it, only one of them was able to get 60fps without disabling GPU acceleration. I am totally lost for what is going wrong, this appears to be really low-level.

The game runs Box2D on the rendering thread (I may move it to a web worker eventually) - but that is not the issue. For people who can run it fast enough to be able to profile it using the Chrome developer tools, the Box2D part uses 0.1% of CPU at maximum, with 1% for rendering and a **whopping ~98% for the Chrome program itself**. Most people can't even profile it because the game locks up their entire computer. I have optimized the game the best I can - it uses gradients and circles, so I have compiled them into per-object images. It uses requestAnimationFrame, only when the Box2D world has finished ticking. It clips the canvas to ensure no extra effort is done to render objects outside of the viewport.

I'm running Linux using Chromium 21 and not having any issues. Someone suggested it might be driver issues, which would be hilarious if true (working on Linux but not Windows), but I doubt it would be happening to so many people if it were."	t5_2r7u2	True

Since the first html 5 ""oficial"" specs I've been aware that some closing tags could be ommited, personally I don't think it's a good practice, just for reading and mantaining concerns. But today someone shared the Google's [HTML/CSS Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/htmlcssguide.xml)

And the example kind of took me by surprise, recommending [this](http://i.imgur.com/DJxRJ.png).

I know in small projects, the file size optimization is not that important. But for a large/high traffic site, would you follow this recommendation?

One of my friends suggested it would be much more effective remove unnecessary images/design and avoid using libraries like jQuery, and I agree, but that's a real option only for personal projects. I highly doubt one of my clients would buy the idea of not having a desing and a bunch of smooth carousels (sic) in exchange of a faster site.

One requirement that makes it more difficult in canvas (though it seems possible via canvas and absolutely positioned text blocks) is that displayed text should be selectable so it can be copied.

Actually out of ignorance, knowing little about SVG, I assumed canvas was the way to go, but is that right? Would SVG be a better fit and if so, why?

1371087352.0	1g8lo0	When will we have UDP?!	JimmyJamNobody	7	0	16	"I just hit a roadblock developing a fast-twitch html5 game. Websockets only use TCP which are just way too slow for this. I'm aware that webRTC datachannels are coming along but they seem to be soley p2p. We need UDP connections with servers! Why don't we have this already? It's insane.

**Edit:** I'm by no means a master in this subject, but here is why I feel that we need UDP for HTML5 gaming. The use-case for UDP is a situation where you need packets as fast as possible and you don't care if a few get lost. A racing game or a shooting game's state packages are a good example because you need the game to be fast enough to react quickly, and you want those states to arrive asap. But if some packets get lost it's fine; by the time they were resent by the origin they would have been too old by the time they got to you. TCP in the other hand asks for confirmation of every single packet arriving, and if the packet doesn't arrive, it will resend it. This uses more bandwidth than UDP for the packet confirmation and holds all of the other packets up. So one small packet loss has a compounding effect, causing a whole bunch of packets to be sent late.

**tl;dr:** problems with TCP for reaction gaming as opposed to UDP:

* increased bandwidth used per packet
* does not allow packet loss leading to knock-on latency after any amount of packet loss.

**Further edit:** I think our best bet is the [webRTC project](http://blog.chromium.org/2013/06/play-cube-slam-real-time-webrtc-video.html). They already have peer-to-peer UDP via the RTP protocol. If this could be extended to include servers then it would bridge this gap."	t5_2r7u2	True
1370982781.0	1g5alu	I have written an emulator frontend that uses HTML5 for scripting and theeming. The problem is, I don't know how to use HTML5+JS that well. Help please!	pnpbios	11	3	3	"[RomFlow](http://www.romflow.com)

So for the last few months I've been working on a slick little project to manage my emulator and rom collection. I already use it on a daily basis. I have the entire thing working well, except for that I only have 2 themes right now. One is using a simple jqueryUI tabs control, and the other one is written using silverlight.

What I would eventually like to get going is a simple menu system similar in appearance to the x-bar that sony uses with it's ps3 and psp system.

I have an API that acts as a communications layer between the html document and the host application. It already handles things like launching games, and registering input callbacks, pulling out a JSON object, etc.

Javascript is kind of not my thing though. I'm not very good at it. I'm much more used to statically typed languages, such as C#, so this is all very new and very mind blowing for me.

So I guess what I am looking for here is

* a good UI toolkit or that will play well with non-traditional input methods (no mouse)
* mentorship (a js buddy that can push me in the right direction when I go off course)
* and / or somebody who would like to try and create a theme on their own.


Currently romflow uses the IE9 rendering engine, because that is what comes with .NET by default, but I am looking into a Gecko/XUL option that would allow for WebGL.

I recently built a quick demo with raphael.js.
http://labs.bebensiganteng.com/html5/raphaeljs/

*please mind the bugs and if it's not loading at first, try to reload the page (without cleaning the cache).*

my only concern is the frame-rate, is really slow, the biggest impact comes from the images/photos since every time it moves it has to redraw everything again.

i'm planning to create my own engine, since raphael.js has so much code that i don't need, but would it possible to achieve a smooth animation with canvas?

I thought about webGL as well but creating a fallback for non-supported browsers would be a lot of work and CSS3 but i'm not sure whether it can achieve this kind of animation.

1369765869.0	1f7pux	Best way to include data (that will populate IndexedDB) with offline HTML5 app?	donrhummy	7	2	8	"

I'm building an offline HTML5 app (it will be delivered as a zipped up .crx file). It will be installed and used entirely offline. At no point will there be internet access.

AFAIK, there is no way to include a pre-populated sqlite DB (and I know you cannot include an indexedDB), so all the data must be included outside a database, but accessible to the javascript code, and then on the first run, put into the database.

What's the best way to do this? (Both from a development/maintenance standpoint as well as actual deployment)

Do I create a database in development and write additional code to spit that out as one of these:

    JSON objects?
    Arrays?
    Actual JavaScript code for inserting into the IndexedDB?
    CSV files?

How does everyone else handle this?

On my Chrome 24.0.1312.70/Kubuntu 12.10/KDE 4.10 setup, I am unable to hear the audio in [this demo](http://lipsync.at/_demo/index.htm). I've heard that it works fine on Windows, which I do not have access to. The demo appears to work fine otherwise.

Things I've figured out:

* The file is downloaded

* An audio stream appears in my KDE Mixer window

* The audio file plays fine when opening in a new tab or audio tag (so the codec is supported)

* The demo appears to use SoundJS, which is called from lipSync_SW.js. [SoundsJS demos](http://www.createjs.com/#!/SoundJS) do work fine.

Are there any common caveats w.r.t. using audio in this sense? (E. g. having to make sure the file starts playing, or manually unmuting/setting the volume.) Does the volume need to be set? Does it load, but is the play function never actually called?

I have lots of ideas for things I want to add, and things I think need added, but I'd like some advice on things that should be added.

Currently, I have the following implemented:

* Base class ( provides classical inheritance which other classes extend )
* System class ( maintains system clock and 'threads' )
* Game class ( update &amp; render loop )
* Image class ( caching and simple rendering )
* Entity class ( self contained object with update &amp; render methods )
* Input Manager ( simple isdown for mouse &amp; key )

I admit, it's not a lot, but I have a lot more working in rough builds that I need to add to the engine, these include:

* Tile based and entity collisions ( using AABB )
* Multi-channel audio ( with caching - not working 100% )
* Animations ( split images up into frames )
* Timers ( frame based and 'precise' )
* Tilesets and Tile maps ( pre-rendering on the maps for speed! )
* Websockets ( send, receive -&gt; [..,..,..] - very simple )
* Vertex based shape rendering ( uses render types akin to that of Game Makers' primitives )
* Smart redrawing ( using 'dirty' rectangles, not optimized )
* ...

There's a lot more **not** done that done, but this is a hobby project, so I have no issues!  Now, the question remains, what am I missing?  The engine will be geared towards 2D games, but that doesn't mean I have to limit myself to retro capabilities.  Why not particles? :)

1309806365.0	igkvm	My company wants to develop HTML5 games for portability reasons. Is it a good idea?	emZi	9	2	3	"I'm working for a company which develops different educational games, on many platform (web, iPad, iPhone, other proprietary platforms).  We have a strong experience in Flash, that's usually how we develop all our apps and games. Recently we've even started porting our Flash games to iPad, simply by exporting them from Flash to .ipa applications, it works really great.

In the last few weeks we signed a contract with a new client, who ask us to develop their game in HTML5, because they think it will be easier / better to port on the iPad later (as it officially supports it).  

I'm not against the idea, but I'm trying to determine if that's indeed a good idea...  The original version of the game we will develop for them will run on a proprietary platform, which come pre-installed only with Internet Explorer 7 by default.  I guess that would be a major issue to support HTML5?

Thanks everybody, your help will be much appreciated!"	t5_2r7u2	True

What is the best way to make the Menu system along the top of the app in the browser?  How should this be done using HTML 5 canvas?  

Typical headings would be:

 File, Image, Help

I'm trying to build a purely client-side app like this:

http://i.imgur.com/OcpM5.jpg

So it has:

* a file input
* a canvas
* an input 
* three buttons: ""add image"", ""add label"", ""save""

1. You select an image from your desktop (a pic of a rabbit, here), it adds it to the canvas. (File API)
2. You type in a label (like ""rabbit"", in this case), click ""add label"" and the text is rendered into the canvas
3. You click ""save"", and it exports the image to a data-uri, which is save-able within the browser.

It seems to me all this should be doable. Am I correct? 

## UPDATE

I got this working:

https://gist.github.com/2299631

It's pretty close to what I had in mind. Still missing: options for placing the text in the image (so that it fits). I'd also like to have a semi-opaque background rectangle behind the text, which would help to get around color clashes between the image and text colors.

HTML5 audio is a bit buggy which is mainly browser problems at the moment, but it generally works pretty well I think!

It doesn't involve coding (that's the main USP) it's based on events, but it can be extended if people write their own plugins in Javascript.

Each of the target pages that the navigation menu goes to , is the same. The content is different but the background color is the same. Now i have tweak it to display a picture rather than a color.

Heres the code to change -

I am hoping that someone in this community can help me make a case for using HTML5 instead of the C# code that is being put in place currently. 

The goal is to do the following: 
1. Pull images from a database and present them as resized thumbnails in a slider. 

2. Thumbnails from the slider can be dragged and dropped into a ""drop zone"" on the page.

3. Thumbnails can be resized while inside the drop zone and layer order can be adjusted.

4. Entire drop zone can then be captured and saved as an image by clicking a save button.

5. Meta data is stored along with the saved image. Example: If you drag a Carrot and an Apple into the drop zone and save the picture it gets stored in a database along with the original attributes (tags) assigned to the components that were dragged and dropped.

I am wondering if someone out there can point me to any resources that would help me learn how to accomplish the above tasks. 

Currently I have this all set up using c# but it is not ideal as it does not work on smartphone browsers and iOS tablets etc. I am thinking HTML5 might be the better way to go.

What do you think? Am I wrong in my assessment?

Oh yeah - everything is running on .net servers if that makes a difference. Unfortunately this can not be changed. 

Thank you all for any insight you may be able to provide.

my bosses want me (former PhP developer, now Ruby for 4 years, no real frontend experience) to make a hiring decision on a frontend developer. The company needs them to develop an HTML5-based frontend for a web application that runs on Android tablets in kiosk mode (backend in Ruby). We use tablets for ordering.

The three contestants for the job all got through the personal screening process and generally display a good knowledge of the technologies needed to work with us (.json/git/whatever). 

But how do I judge their code? I have seen samples and they all look pretty clean and structured, there's no way I could decide based on what i see. In Ruby, I am used to looking at github profiles/repos and maybe do a code eval on codeeval.com. But what's the equivalent to that on the frontend?

- Are there any code evals for HTML5?
- What kind of sample task should I give them (if at all)?
- Any other good advice on what separates good from excellent frontend developers?

Thank you guys, you are my only hope.

I've got a thread going on over in the JS subreddit at the moment on ""which charting library should I use"":

I found myself wanting to ask a similar - but more general - question and didn't want it to get lost in all of the responses on there.  And the HTML5 subreddit seemed a more suitable choice for this one.


So, **which technology do you see as becoming more dominant in the coming years?**  I appreciate the main difference (no scene-graph, vector versus raster, etc), but I'm not sure how significant they really are, when decent canvas libraries abstract that sort of thing away by having their own object-based approach.

As I understand it canvas tends to take up a lot less cpu/memory than the DOM-intensive SVG too?

1315615420.0	kanvo	Question about clipping, or how to draw outside of canvas dimensions	mx-chronos	5	1	4	"Hello, I am new to HTML5, but got tasked with writing a converter to take FXG commands and translate them into Canvas draw calls.  This has been going well enough, but my overall unfamiliarity with HTML5/CSS has led to some confusion along the way, and I am hoping somewhere here can help me out or otherwise direct me to assistance.

I am creating a canvas for every FXG file to be rendered (please let me know how to correct if this is bad practice, it makes sense from my Flash perspective) and sizing it to the dimensions of the top Group node.  The problem comes in with strokeWidth - for example I am drawing a rounded rectangle (using context.arc) starting at the origin point.  It seems like the line weight is being centered, so if this is a 4px line, there are 2px above the center and 2px below; since I set my canvas size to exactly equal the shape size, the 2px line above the zero point is being clipped out.

I hope I explained that well, but if not please see [this screenshot](http://imgur.com/tw09I), that should show what I mean.

In Flash this would be a simple fix as I could set clipping=false on the container, but I am not aware of an equivalent to this setting in HTML5/CSS.  I tried using the overflow and clipping style attributes, but with no luck.  I know that in this example I could use a larger canvas and offset the draw calls and position values, but I think that will get really messy trying to account for negative values in Path data and other graphical elements which FXG allows to exist outside of the box model.

I am hoping that what I am trying to do is actually very simple, and it is just an issue of my being unfamiliar with the syntax.  So I am asking for anyone who has experience with this sort of thing, please point me in the right diretion.  Is there a way to disable clipping to display graphics beyond the dimensions of the canvas?"	t5_2r7u2	True

From what I read the functionality (not sure what I should call this) is still javascript - but HTML5 now provides tags that allow javascript to create this kind of stuff?

How does that work? Were there any changes to javascript?

Is there any article that explains how HTML5 is able to do what it does?

I guess what is confusing me is that whenever you see shiny stuff like drag &amp; drop it's labeled HTML5 - but isn't it actually javascript that's responsible for that behaviour?

I thought to myself this should be quite an easy task, I think I've seen some HTML before, helped someone put together a simple website for one of their classes, I've got this.

Well I just started to try and put this together for my friend and I realized I don't exactly know what I thought I did. I looked at some tutorial websites to try and find a quick template to drop the video into and I'm not even sure that that is right. I found something like this:

Trying to transition my .jpeg logo to an actual embedded font and I've gotten this far with the text.

Just wondering how I can give it a class using &lt;p&gt; with DIFFERENT fonts but still have it appear next to each other (ie. Rebel Grade) without automatically inserting a paragraph spacing as shown in the link right now.

If you pop open my code, you'll see that ""Rebel"" is supposed to be in Telegrafico font and ""Grade"" is supposed to be in Kravitz. Which they both are, but I just want them to appear right next to each other.

I feel like this is something really easy but I'm completely clueless as of now and don't know how to give it a class without using &lt;p&gt;.

We were just going to just write apps for IOS and android platforms since it seemed simple enough and it was a basic app so not to tough on the coding. got the andorid app running and thats all well, but now our problem is the IOS app, and so i made a post over at [/r/iphone](/r/iphone),  [this was my original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/ncnh1/app_development_questions/), and in there i was recommened to create a web app in html5.

now i was wondering if you would be able to help me with this and point me in the right direction.

my brother is an emt and i was helping him create the apps for him and his coworkers to make it easier for them to search through different ""standing orders"" and procedures depending on different scenarios they face.  and so this is where i ask for your help. i have a basic understanding of html and css, and i dont really know much about html5 besides its potential abilities. I was wondering if you guys could point me in the right direction of the place where i can get  a good tutorial or explanation of basic html5 syntax, and then also the best way to go about programming a way for the web app to have a ""save"" feature for the whole app. Since i don't know exactly how the save feature works, a good place to find a more indepth explanation of how it works would be greatly appreciated as well, because i would need to make sure that all the pages are actually accessible all the time, as internet access is not always available to their phones.

tl;dr: need to create a web app for my brother, which has a link of lists to information placed within it, the app needs to also be available offline as well, and so i was looking for a point in the right direction of a good tutorial"	t5_2r7u2	True

Even with my attempts to minimize Backbone overhead with how it relates to the canvas the performance is noticeable much worse.

Besides the developer's site (there a kind of forum there but it's terrible to find anything there) and the initial reaction on the web when they announced the whole thing the last summer, I couldn't find any opinion from the developers that have used it.

So, if any of you have used it or know more about this, please share your experiences here. I'm also interrested in the pricing of the whole thing, since they will probably charge for using it once it will be complete.

And it seems to work on Firefox and Chrome. I can't get it to work or even show up in Safari and IE.

There is a help file that instructs me to add some video items to the htaccess which I've done, however I can't seem to get it working on all platforms.

I've probably done something dumb.	monkeymad2	3	0	7	"Yesterday I was making a 404 page using Canvases when I checked it out in Chrome and Safari it worked fine - but Firefox and Opera wouldn't show the ""beam"" of the torch. -but everything else worked perfectly. I've checked over and reformated my code a few times - it runs in firefox but just doesn't display anything. So I turn to you, reddit.

There's a copy of the page at:

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1482003/canvasshadow/404y.html

Here's the function that's causing the problems:

function makelight(){
	var bcxt=beamcnv.getContext(""2d"");
	bcxt.clearRect(0,0,document.width,document.height);
	var midx = (beamx+beamx+(130+textpos*4))/2;
	
	bcxt.lineWidth = 5;
    bcxt.strokeStyle = ""rgba(250,250,110,0.3)"";
	bcxt.fillStyle = ""rgba(250,250,110,0.8)"";
	
	beamx+=15;
	bcxt.beginPath();
	bcxt.moveTo(lampx,lampy);
	bcxt.lineTo(beamx,beamy+60);
	
	bcxt.arcTo(midx,beamy+120,(beamx+(130+textpos*4)),beamy+60,(90+(textpos*5)));
	bcxt.lineTo((beamx+(130+textpos*4)),beamy+60);
	bcxt.lineTo(lampx,lampy);
	
	bcxt.closePath();
    
    
    bcxt.fill();
    
    bcxt.stroke();
    beamx-=15;

	
}

I've tried changing the color from rgba to ""yellow"" but that doesn't help anything.
I've fiddled with the z-index to make sure it's not just being rendered behind anything and it doesn't appear to be. 
I've taken out the ""arcTo"" to check if that's what was causing the problem - it wasn't.
I've looked at Mozillia's dev pages for canvas and I can't find anything that says this shouldn't work.

Anyway, thanks for any help - it's probably just some dumb cross-browser thing that I don't know about.

(Also if there's a dedicated subreddit for code checking then sorry for putting this here.)

Specifially what I'm trying to do is show an image that the user can change and what that user can change is the object the color of the object the graphic on the object and the colors of the graphic without changing the back ground. Whew! Did that make sense to anyone? I know I could just have the drop down menus select a different image forf each variation, but the # of pics and item I would need to create is somewhere around 11,088.

1292370186.0	elwn8	New to webpage coding and need help!	dolmaface	4	3	7	"I have been offered by a friend to upgrade his photography website into html5. He doesn't know that I don't know how to code, and doesn't expect me to complete this project for about a month. His request are as follows:

Front Page: Logo centered at the top with links to other pages to either side of it, a live slideshow of his pictures centered in the page, and small tiles underneath the slideshow.

Contact Page: Box to write name, issue or question, etc... and a send button which will foward the message to his email. Some more pictures around the page.

Gallery Pages: For this he wants of course his pictures, but when a picture is clicked on it displays option for what size one could order it, the price, and option to add to cart.

User login Page: Show users name, display the users pictures etc... options for the user to order pictures. 


Other Pages: Basic writing with some more pictures, nothing special.

So my question is, can I learn how to do this stuff within the next month and get it done for him? If I can, what will it take, and how can I learn. I do not know anything about webpage coding at all. Also, the site he uses to edit his photography site is homestead.com, if that changes anything. If you are wondering why I am doing this, its for the large amount of money he will pay me, I am willing to whatever it takes!"	t5_2r7u2	True
