Along the way I found you can reference names other than HEAD in this @{...} way.

`cwsc = commit -m ""whitespace-cleanup""`:  I'll frequently, when starting work on a file, run whitespace-cleanup on it. I like these changes to be separate from the logical changes.

`lg = log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)&lt;%an&gt;%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative`: I found this on somewhere and rather like the density of information it gives-- oneline log format, decorated with refnames, showing the graph as well.

2. Understand how Git works with respect to large files, namely datasets.

3. How can I think of what a ""version"" is in this system? For example, how can I pull up the version that was used to submit the first draft of a paper to a journal?

4. Is Git a specific approach to workflow or is it a framework on which you can apply different workflows?

Honestly, I am just so lost by the volume of information about Git and that most of it is related to technical development that I can't fully grasp where I should start in learning Git for research. 

Also, if this is important. I am not a developer or a heavy command line user, but I have a somewhat decent familiarity with that kind of thing.

**git-ws**

`git-ws` is a command line utility designed to help working with multiple git repositories at once. It's currently intended for personal use only, but quite functional. Before putting a lot of time into its development (for polishing and creating a GUI), I was wondering if there was any interest in a tool like this.

Using `git-ws` in a folder calls git commands (and shell commands) in all folders which are git repositories.

---

**Most useful commands**

* `git-ws ?`: displays auto-generated help for all commands
* `git-ws ? 'cmd name'`: displays auto-generated help for a command
* `git-ws query`: displays all repos detected by git-ws, also detecting what ones are changed(unstaged changes) or ahead of the remote repository
* `git-ws push`: push staged changes
* `git-ws push -a`: push staged changes, only in repos ahead from remote
* `git-ws pull`: pull latest version
* `git-ws pull -s`: pull latest version, stashing all changes before pulling
* `git-ws status`: displays short git status, ignoring dirty submodules
* `git-ws submodule au`: stashes local submodules, pulls the latest submodule versions, commits, and pushes
* `git-ws do 'cmd here'`: runs a subshell in every repo, and executes a bash command in it
* `git-ws do -c 'cmd here'`: runs a subshell in every repo with changes, and executes a command in it
* `git-ws do -a 'cmd here'`: runs a subshell in every ahead repo, and executes a command in it

---

**Why is this useful?**

Real-life situation: I'm working on my game, Open Hexagon, and related libraries. Pretty much every library has submodules (that have submodules of their own, etc).
I create a `OHWorkspace` folder, where I clone all the required git repos.

* `mkdir OHWorkspace; cd OHWorkspace`
* `git clone https://.../SSVUtils`
* `git clone https://.../SSVUtilsJson`
* `git clone https://.../SSVStart`
* `git clone https://.../&lt;etc&gt;`
* `git clone https://.../SSVOpenHexagon`

Now my directory tree looks like this:

     
    OHWorkspace/
        	...
        	SSVUtils/
        		.git/
        		...
        	SSVUtilsJson/
        		.git/
        		...
        	SSVStart/
        		.git/
        		...
        	SSVOpenHexagon/
        		.git/
        		...
    
    
I work on all the repos simultaneously. I constantly need to check what repos I've modified.

* `cd OHWorkspace/; git-ws st` (st == status)
* returns a human-readable list of changes

After I review changes, it's time to commit.

* `git-ws do -c 'gitg'` (this opens gitg in every repo with changes to commit) 

After I use gitg to make my commits:

* `git-ws push -a; git-ws sub au` (all staged commits in ahead repos are pushed to GitHub - then, every submodule is recursively pulled, updated, and pushed, so that the online and local submodules are up-to-date)"	t5_2qhv1	True

* Merge commits from upstream, keep them separate for situations where code was modified both by my fork and upstream (is this worth additional effort?)

1334520176.0	sb76a	Git workflow and releases	sybrandy	15	1	25	"Hello,

I'm hoping for some advice related to the git workflow we're currently using at work.  Here's the current process:

1. ""git pull"" - This should be done on the master branch.
2. ""git checkout -b TASK-ID"" - Create a new branch for the task.  TASK-ID would be something like ""PEGAS-101""
3. Work on the task and commit changes as needed.
4. When done with the task, ""git checkout master""
5. ""git pull"" - Get any changes that have been made since the last pull.
6. Resolve any conflicts and ensure the current version in the master compiles.
7. Checkout the branch you have been working in: ""git checkout TASK-ID""
8. Merge in the changes from the master: ""git merge master""
9. Resolve any conflicts and commit the changes.
10. Check out the master again.
11. ""git merge --squash TASK-ID"" - This treats all of the commits in the branch as one commit when merging.
12. ""git commit"" - Add any additional information, specifically the TASK-ID, to the commit message.
13. ""git push"" - Push the changes back to the server.

This has worked out well for us so far, however we're getting to the point where we need to deal with releases of our software.  Since there's the case where we may have to make fixes to a version in production that's behind what's in our master, I wanted to take a stab at figuring out a way to do it cleanly and easily without accidentally mucking up anything along the way.  I have no idea how many different versions will be in production (depends on how many customers we end up having and how often they're willing to upgrade).  Here are several ideas that have come up via research and discussion:

* All changes go to the master and you cherry-pick the fixes you need.  This is O.K., however I'm concerned that if we've restructured something in the master, such as the model for a RoR project, that we may not even have that issue that needs fixed.  Or, the code has changed enough that to make it work we need to make significant changes to the production version.
* We have a single release branch that hold all of the tags to all of the different versions we have.  The question becomes, how do we apply the same fix to multiple versions?
* We have one branch per release and fixes in one branch get merged/cherry picked into the other branches if possible.  This seems to be the most reasonable as we can update individual versions as needed, but still be able to apply the same fix to other versions that have been release as long as the affected code is similar.

What are your thoughts?  Please keep in mind that I'm not git expert yet, so any suggestions are welcome.  I know this isn't git-specific, but since we are using git for our version control, I figured it's best to ask here in case there are any technical issues/constraints that are git-specific that may affect what we're trying to do.

With windows, managing my products was so easy with the Github UI, I could work on a project for a couple hours, changing files, adding files, deleting files and then at the end of the night go on Github, hit commit. And that's it.

I installed git, and I set up my user info. Nothing is actually confusing, but the problem i'm having is that it seems like I need to stage a file any single time I edit it? This seems so hard to keep track of? Will I basically have to make it a chore that everytime I save a file I stage it? The tutorial i'm reading is here;

This is my workflow (it is circular, but I have to start somewhere, so if it seems weird, read through to the last step so it makes sense):

* Get to computer at work
* Manually delete my old directory
* Clone my up-to-date directory from GitHub
* Manually select the branch I was last working on
* Work on things, commit and sync changes to GitHub
* Go to another computer (home)
* Manually delete my old directory
* Clone my up-to-date directory from GitHub
* Manually select the branch I was last working on
* Work on things, commit and sync changes to GitHub

This has worked for me for months (amazed at myself for not fixing this earlier), but feels very tedious.  **I have a feeling I am unaware of a command that allows me to update my local repository to match what changes have been committed on my GitHub repository.**  Is there such a command?

If it matters, I am using the [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/) gui app instead of using the command prompt.  (command prompt feels ugly to me in Windows so I got used to using GUI versions of Git when using Windows).  However, I am not opposed to switching to using the command prompt to make my life a lot easier.

It was requested that I install Gerrit for the code review and gated check in functionality.  It seems though that to do this correctly I'd be ripping out the Gitolite stuff and redoing authentication to be done through Gerrit.  Alternatively, I can set up a separate Gerrit based repository which the Gitolite maintained repository does occasional clones of (which feels like a kludge to me).  

Searches of the interwebs aren't being terribly helpful thus far; Most seem to just be set up guides for and initial install/setup Gerrit on a bare server.  Are there any other options I am missing?  

EDIT:  
Hadn't found this page before now: http://iridescenturchin.blogspot.com/2009/09/code-review-for-git.html

EDIT II:  
Decided that Gerrit was the way to go.  It seems to be the only one that is going to gate check in's and install isn't that bad (as said below).  I had more trouble finding an openID Server that would work.  To that end, I will save someone else the trouble and just say that [CommunityID](http://www.itadmins.net/blog/category/itadminsprojects/community-id/) seems to be a good way to go if you want your own openID server. Set up was easy, in spite of a lack of decent documentation, and it was the first one I found that played nice with Gerrit.

We are on a pretty terrible source control system now and I would love to try and get the team to move to git.
We don't really use the distributed aspect of git as we would basically maintain a central repo that people would push and pull from, but I wanted something that was far more flexible that what we currently have as well as faster.
So my main questions are: have people here had to try to introduce git to a company and what steps did you do to really sell it? What types of hurdles did you encounter during the transition and what did you do to overcome them? What did you do in the face of opposition to the move? 
I've already set up a git server, but what I want to do is to have all the bells and whistles up and running to that when I present it I can show off the power and flexibility of git.

Any feedback would be awesome.

The alias basically ""owns"" any uppercase alphanumerics at the end of your branch names (which I find that not many people use uppercase at all) and assumes you use dashes as separators.  If you do something different, you should find it fairly easy to modify to your liking.

I share it because I've been finding it useful for ad-hoc notations on branches.  I don't get bothered by extremely long branch names because I have another alias / utility that lets me switch branches using a simple `dialog` / GUI script so I'm never typing the full branch names anyway.

I'd love feedback and for people to make fun of my shell scripting in the form of implementing it in a ~better~ way.

I'm considering just merging them all together into a single repo using **git-subtree** and maintaining them as a single entity (and ceasing development on the original distinct repos).

Another approach that has been suggested is to use **git-submodule** and have the shared code in a separate repo that is added to the other repos as a submodule. However, when I look up submodule-related stuff, I usually see people warning against using them.

I've also looked into [**git-stitch-repo**](https://metacpan.org/module/git-stitch-repo) for combining repos.

I'm getting the hang of basic branching and merging, but do have a couple questions on the best way to approach this, in case I'm missing anything.

I have three repositories.  A central repository (origin), a repository on the test/stage server, and a repository on the production server.

Master is always the current production version.

I do the actual branching and testing on the test server.  The master branch is the starting point when creating testing and stage branches.

Once the test branch is finished, I merge it into stage, and then if there's another branch, repeat until all pending branches are tested then merged into stage.

At this point, I do a checkout of stage, which now contains all pending changes, and do a quick test of each item that was patched to ensure it still works.

So, is it best to then merge stage into master on the test server, push to origin, and then on production, pull master?

Or should I push stage to production, and merge there?

Does it matter?

I'm trying to keep it as simple as possible, but I'm new enough to git, I don't want to make a dumb mistake.

    git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always

After almost five years of using git, I'm ready to leave the simple merge behind and embrace automatic rebasing and pushing among _all_ topic branches. Here are my thoughts.

* I'm now thinking of all branches as tracking branches. Some local branches track remote branches. Other local branches track `master` or other local branches. But everything's tracking something. It's symmetrical--we do the same thing from git's point of view when we push to a remote and when we merge into local master. They can both be done with push.

* The workflow is symmetrical. It's always `git pull` (to rebase) followed by `git push` (to push by fast-forward merge). No need to checkout master, merge in topic branch, then checkout topic branch again.

* I can always fall back on `git fetch` and `git merge` if something smells fishy.

* Topic branches are short-lived (by definition). I don't care about retaining a branchy history with them because there's no useful information I can extract from the branchy history. And, there is a mental cost to parsing and understanding the tree structure and relationships between all those branches that seems too much of a hassle for all the benefits they _don't_ offer.

* I can always set up specific branches to _not_ rebase with `git config branch.&lt;name&gt;.rebase false`.

Hopefully this should eliminate quite a bit of checkout and merge command typing ... not to mention untangling messy branch histories."	t5_2qhv1	True

Local Machine: Do all my coding here

Web Server: Hosting websites, and a couple applications.

There is only one user that can login to the web server via ssh, and it does not have access to pretty much anything. It can however login as root once connected.

So as I make a change on my local repo I want to be able to push it to the server to update the live code. Right now I have to copy the files I need to place on the server with scp, and then login and login as root. Then once logged in as root I copy the files to the webserver vhost folder and chown them to be owned by the http user.

If it matters I am using Nginx, PHP-FPM, MySQL.

Ideally I would like to setup git to host my code on the server so I can access it from multiple machines, but I haven't found out the best way to do that yet. All the articles I have seen are pretty old, and all are geared towards Ubuntu. I am using Arch Linux on all of my machines, server included.

1373330178.0	1hwhfg	Configuring an internal centralized GIT server for multiple unrelated projects and users.	oldcrowmedicinethrow	11	0	19	"**Details and Objective**

Hi everyone, I'm working in web development and I'm currently using git locally for several unrelated projects I'm working on. I have a directory on my computer with several repo's in it and I use source tree.

My goal is to set up a GIT server so that other devs in the organization can collaborate on projects; I should start by saying that we can't use Github because of red tape and a stubborn contracts office but the good new is we have all the resources we need to set everything up internally.

We typically use centOS for everything server related and almost all of our dev's are windows users. 

This is more of a configuration/structure question than a *How do I use GIT?* question

**Questions:**

1. Does anyone have any tips for configuring an Git server using centOS. Shoud I use SAMBA or something so the repos are directly accessible from remote clients?
1. How should I organize my directories, repos, etc? Right now, I have a directory on my computer with a few repos in it for separate projects; in theory I might be collaborating with completely different people on all of them but, right now, it's just local and I'm the only one making commits.
1. Are there any questions that I need to be asking that I'm not?
1. Please let me know if I can provide anymore information that might help.

**Thanks!**"	t5_2qhv1	True

I'm trying to improve the way I use it, so I've been doing some research. The article called [""A successful Git branching model""](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) advocates the use of the ""--no-ff"" flag when merging branches. However, the [""Understanding the Git Workflow""](http://sandofsky.com/blog/git-workflow.html) article advocates *not* using it. Both articles seem well-written and they make sense, but I'm leaning more towards following the advice of the latter. I have a few questions about it. I realize I could contact the author directly, but, according to [his Twitter profile](http://twitter.com/sandofsky), he's the tech lead on Twitter for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. That being the case, I doubt I'd get a response any time soon, if at all!

I think I understand the solutions the author talks about. I mostly just don't understand some parts about the problems he explains. I think in order for me to fully undertand the solutions, I must first fully understand the problems that they solve. So here are my questions:

1. There is a paragraph about *blame*. I don't understand the problem the author is illustrating and how he came to the conclusion that he did about *blame* not working in the way you would expect it to in the given scenario.

2. The author says that there are two reasons why revision control exists: (1) to help the act of writing code (syncing changes and backing up) and (2) configuration management (managing parallel lines of development, figuring out when exactly something changed, etc.). He then goes on to say that traditionally, these two reasons conflict. I don't understand how they conflict.

3. I don't understand the last sentence of this paragraph: ""Feature branches seem like a happy middle ground. They solve the basic problems of parallel development. You’re thinking of integration at the least important time, when you’re writing the code, but it will get you by for some time.""

I've been working on a solution to help with the software development life cycle and I've built some interesting tools that will make working with Git easier.  I've created the site http://gitintel.com and I am positioning the product as providing Git intelligence (insight/code discovery).

It seems like my site is still creating confusion.  For example, some assumed my video implied it only works for a certain workflow/branching strategy.  It doesn't and it really doesn't care.

I'm not sure if it is because they are not familiar with Git or if my site is still not able to show any value, which is why I'm here. I figure most of you know Git well enough that the feedback would at least eliminate that variable.

Thanks  

Edit: 
Thanks to the feedback from beardowner, wolfcore and others, I think I have found a way to better explain what my product does.  I'm also going to stop using http://gitintel.com and have decided to use http://gitsense.com instead.

So far, loving it; I didn't take advantage of many of the social features of github anyway.  But one thing I miss is the github API.  I had it feed info into my blog, and I really liked that ability to create a quick overview of my work.

So, with node.js to provide some simple async requests to bitbucket pages, I cobbled together an API of sorts.  [The project is available on bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/cmoore4/bitbucket-api).  I also have a sample implementation up at [my site](http://bitbucket.csmooreinc.com/user/cmoore4).

The API talks HTML to browsers, but JSON to everything else (based on Accept headers and xhr).  It's not at all complete, and I need to add more additional scraping to have it output more information. However, I figured I'd release the alpha here to get feedback, if anyone has any.

EDIT:  So, as xtagon pointed out, [looks like BB *does* have an API now.](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Using+the+Bitbucket+REST+APIs)  I swear, I looked all over when I started writing this, and all I could find were references to how it didn't have one.

1342185683.0	whx49	What did I do?	apiguy	12	2	14	"I'm a long time mercurial user who just started using git. I feel I may have seriously misunderstood branching in git. So after getting a conflict and then resolving the conflict and committing I noticed there were 2 branches:

    $ git branch
      * (no branch)
      master

And apparently I was on the ""no branch"" branch. I was trying to merge my changes but got:

    $ git merge master
    Already up-to-date.

Which was strange so I did a pull:

    $ git pull
    Username: 
    Password: 
    You are not currently on a branch, so I cannot use any
    'branch.&lt;branchname&gt;.merge' in your configuration file.
    Please specify which branch you want to merge with on the command
    line and try again (e.g. 'git pull &lt;repository&gt; &lt;refspec&gt;').
    See git-pull(1) for details.

Which lead me to do:

    $ git pull origin master
    Username: 
    Password: 
    From https://github.com/xxx/xxx
    * branch            master     -&gt; FETCH_HEAD
    Already up-to-date.

So I thought, OK if its up to date there, I'll just push maybe?

    $ git push
    Username: 
    Password: 
    Everything up-to-date

I then concluded that the merge might have been successful and so I decided to switch to the master branch to check it out - I think this is where I made my fatal mistake:

    $ git branch master
    fatal: A branch named 'master' already exists.

And of course, everything I had done for the entire day vanished, and there seems to be no way to get back to the branch I was on before.

    $ git branch
    * master

Did I just destroy an entire days worth of work? Or is there a way to get back?

1336545786.0	tech8	How do I host Git repos on Windows?	nrogers64	11	1	22	"I've got a desktop computer with Windows Vista installed. It acts as a file server and web server. It also has some scheduled tasks. It works well for everything I want it to do, but I'm not sure how to go about adding the role of being a Git repository server onto it.

I'll explain my goal: I have two Mac laptops that I do most of my web development on. What I'd like to be able to do is code on one laptop, commit, and push my changes to the Windows computer. Then, if I have the one Mac laptop doing something else, I can always go on the other Mac laptop, pull the latest changes down, continue coding, commit, and push the changes back to the Windows computer.

I tried [GitStack](http://gitstack.com/), but I couldn't get it to work. It kept saying ""fatal: bad default revision 'HEAD'"". GitStack feels fairly bloated, too. What should I do? Any help would be appreciated.

**EDIT**: After reading these comments, I did some experimenting and I think I got it working.

Consider the following scenario:

* My Windows Vista computer has a network share called ""Git"". Currently, it's just an empty folder.
* One of my Mac laptops has an existing project called ""awesome-project"". It is *not* currently a Git repository; it's just a normal folder.
* I want to push the project onto the Windows Vista computer and then pull it down on my other Mac laptop.
* The ""Git"" share has been mounted on both Mac laptops.

Commands to run on the first Mac laptop:

    mkdir /Volumes/Git/awesome-project/
    git init --bare !$
    cd /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/awesome-project/
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m ""Initial commit""
    git remote add origin /Volumes/Git/awesome-project/
    git push origin master

Commands to run on the second Mac laptop:

    cd /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/
    git clone /Volumes/Git/awesome-project/

1360991502.0	18mhfu	Friend and I started a new project with Git(first time) we encountered a big mess when trying to commit our code to GitHub.  I would like to see if we are using this correctly for our situation.	kassanu	9	0	12	"My friend and I are working on a project for class and we decided to use git to get into good habits with version control.  He is totally new to version control and I have used git on my own for a personal project but nothing too serious.  We set up a repo on GitHub and we are using the GitHub for Windows Program (http://windows.github.com/) for managing our repos.    
  
We both cloned the repository that was on GitHub and began working on our files(both on the master branch) but when it came time to commit and sync our code it got really messed up.  I committed first and synced fine to the repo on GitHub.  When he went to commit his changes it failed to commit and said something about a detached head and there were problems merging files to the master branch(The GitHub program showed that he had a branch called DETACHEDHEAD).  We ended up having to destroy his repo and transfer his files to my computer and manually merge everything so I could commit them to GitHub myself.
  
I don't really understand what had happened.  Was it a problem that we were working on the same branch and made changes to the same files?  I have never used git with multiple people so I'm unsure if we can edit the same files and then sync them or if we would have to create our own branches and merge them onto the master branch.  Could anyone explain what happened when I committed and synced my local repository to GitHub and after when he tried to do the same git created a detached head and said there were errors with our repository that had to be debugged?
  
Sorry I don't have the actual errors this happened earlier in the day and I've been trying to figure this out on my own for the past couple of hours.  If anyone needs more information about our setup I can provide any info.  Thank you!

*******UPDATE**********

My friend and I met up again over the weekend.  We went over the book Pro Git that forlasanto recommended and it went a lot better.  I read over everyone's comments and started reading the other links on the side bar and stuff and I hope I'm starting to get a good hang of this now.  Thank you all for the help!"	t5_2qhv1	True
1355011346.0	14isxp	What are appropriate uses for git submodules?	peterlundgren	14	5	4	"I'm struggling to grok what problems `git submodule` solves.

At first, it seems like an excellent way to version your dependencies. Put libraries (plugins, modules, gems, third party software, internal software) in submodules, put code shared between projects in submodules, put your whole tool-chain in submodules. Never have problems with reproducibility again!

But what that gains in reproducibility, it loses in duplication. If any two modules share the same submodule, you now need two copies of it. Maybe they're at different versions, maybe they're not. A submodule may be used in multiple different projects entirely. In the best case, that means longer builds. In the worst case, you may not be able to get multiple versions to co-exist.

If `git submodule` isn't suited for tracking dependencies, what is it good for and what are better ways to track dependencies?"	t5_2qhv1	True
1346254983.0	z0vtq	How can I get a more readable (albeit inaccurate) diff output?	0sse	9	1	12	"The other day I was reindenting a shell script to replace eight-space indents
with four-space indents. I decided to do this is one commit since it was one
logical change to a file in the repository. When looking at the output of `git
diff` I noticed something interesting.
[""Pictures""](https://gist.github.com/3497287) say more than a thousand words.

Notice that git says line no. 16 is unchanged, but that when you follow the
flow of the script it is (logically speaking) actually two different lines.
Because of changes in indentation the second-level `then` line now looks
exactly like the first-level one previously did. An equivalent situation arises
with the `fi` line on line 23.

Technically speaking the diff is correct and I have no problem with it. But in
my opinion it would be much easier for a human to see what is going on in the
diff if `git diff` would *show* these several diff hunks as one larger one, i.e.
pretend as if the single context lines in between were part of the diff
itself. 

I already know about the `-w` and `-b` arguments to `git diff` that ignore
changes in whitespace. But in this case the change in whitespace is the whole
point of the commit! After some digging I found the flag `--inter-hunk-context`
which according to the man page seems to be *exactly* what I want, but it
doesn't seem to make a difference no matter if I do `--inter-hunk-context=1` or
`0` or `10`, or `999` for that matter.

Does anyone know how I can achieve what I want? Have I completely misunderstood
the `--inter-hunk-context` option? Have I gone off the rails for wanting a
feature like this?

Thanks! :)

There are only two of us for now but the workgroup is expected to grow soon. We are working over a local network, running Debian Linux and we need the sysadmin's permission to install software.


What we usually do to is to pull/push through an SSH login which envolves someone walking over to the other person's cubicle and insert his own password which is obviously bad.


We know how to set up an SSH key, but then we'd gain access to each other's home directory's contents. We could also create a new user and use it as a sort of hub, but it is my understanding that git is not supposed to be used that way, it is a 'distributed' system.


So maybe my question isn't especific to git, but I'd like to know if there's a way to create a group with read-only privilegies to the git repository in question.

I know about selecting the valid code from 2 panes and pressing Ctrl-1 or 2 to select the right one in the merge result.

I'm planning on just doing ""git svn clone svn://svnserver/ -T Trunk"" (which I assume only downloads Trunk revisions), and then modifying the [svn-remote ""svn""]-branches config to point at *particular* branches/shelves/spikes of interest that I may be working on and switching to often. I assume that I'd be able to add more to that config as time goes on and bozos keep copying the trunk to odd places, right? (With appropriate commands to download from SVN after.)

Running 20 Codeigniter websites from the same codebase, all connecting to different databases and each website containing an individual IPB (Invision Power Board) installation.



While websites all run off the same code, they all have a custom look which is achieved by a mix of global assets (js/css/images) and site based ones.



**Remote server**



**Global codebase (No domain assigned)**

/home/includes/application

/home/includes/system

/home/includes/ipbwi

 


**Global assets (Domain assigned - http://www.globassets.com)**

**Individual site (Domain assigned - http://www.websitea.com)**

Landing on an individual website http://www.websitea.com/index.php will include the common codebase from 

/home/includes/(application/system/ipbwi)

Then will display output which calls on assets

http://www.globassets.com/assets/css/global.css

And then local assets

Local Environment



2 developers working on website

1 - Mac user

1 - Windows user



Development server located locally in office - 192.168.9.10 (dev)



Development server is a WAMP installation - C:\wamp\



**Global codebase**

c:\wamp\global\application

c:\wamp\global\system

c:\wamp\global\ipbwi

 

**Global assets**

c:\wamp\www\assets\



**Individual site**

c:\wamp\www\assets\



Currently the code is edited on the development server and all testing is done by accessing the shared server through 192.168.9.10 address. The servers wamp directory is shared to us using simple windows network share with permissions set to allow only us to write to it. The network share is then loaded into our editors (SublimeText/Textmate) and we work on a file, save, then test.



If one of us write a line which breaks the site, it will go down for us both, and similarly if we edit the same file at the same time, issues occur. 



When we manage to get the development server to a level where we're ready to push to the remote live site, we simply upload the c:\wamp\global\application folder to /home/includes/application and hope for the best. A copy is normally made of the remote folder to ensure we can revert if all goes wrong. 



Slight improvements have been made recently so that instead of pushing code which goes to all websites, its pushed to a /home/includes/application-test/ folder, and the index.php of 1 website is pointed to it and tested remotely.



I want to improve this setup with Git, but not sure how to best set it up because no example seems to mirror how we work (unsurprisingly). My main questions/issues/understandings are:



Local development server

- Should be a 'bare' repository

- Needs to have a 'working directory' added to it pointing to the c:\wamp\www\ folder. Not doing this would mean the server would return no view as technically it would have no files on it. 

- Would be our 'origin'

- 2 branches, master and development



Each developer 

- Needs to have a local repository on their machine and an appropriate WAMP/LAMP installation, no more working off our machines. 



This is as far as I can seem to understand it. I'm not really sure which branch should be checked out on the dev server master/dev. I don't understand if we all locally have the same master/dev branches, work on development branch and always push to the development branch on the dev server. 



I also presume the git repo can sit in c:\wamp\ and be told to ignore everything (using gitignore) except \global\ and \www\ so that it will only monitor



c:\wamp\global\

c:\wamp\www\

and ignore

c:\wamp\bin etc...



I know theres not really a direct question in this but can somebody tell me if I look to be along the right lines and explain the workflow for each day in terms of what is checked out where, and then where the update to the remote server is pushed from. Also not sure if Im right about having a bare repo on the dev server and if any interaction with that ever has to happen from the development machine or do we install and forget in a way?



Any advice or pointers appreciated."	t5_2qhv1	True
1313972561.0	jq2sn	Could I use git to host an audio project? 	Trangatrang	10	3	16	"By day I work for a small tech startup doing QA and frontend stuff for various projects.  90% of our stuff is on git so I am a moderately competent user and understand most of the core concepts.  

By night I compose and record music at my house using Logic and I am interested in sharing a project with another producer who happens to live far away.  The guy on the other end does not have a comp sci background but will most likely be able to install git and clone a repo without too much difficulty.

My main question here is this:
If I use git to host an audio project, created using Logic, and containing numerous audio and midi files, would I be able to clone it on another machine and have it run with minimal effort?  I am thinking similar to cloning an xcode project and opening the .xcodeproj  since logic uses a .logic file in kind of the same way.

There are lots of people saying that git is not a good backup system and that seems to make sense, but I am more interested in sharing  material and I would definitely take advantage of the VC aspects as well."	t5_2qhv1	True

* init a Git repository directly inside my home directory

* have 2 separate branches for private and public files
* use the private branch for checkout and commit, and merge desired changes to the public branch
* regularly push the public branch to GitHub, and the private one to my own server

But I have a few questions about this setup:

* if I ignore everything ('*'), will new files in tracked directories be ignored as well? Is there a way around this without excluding each tracked directory in my .gitignore?
* do I have to manually cherry-pick all the commits from the private branch when merging to the public branch, or can I automatically select all the commits that only apply to files already existing in the public branch?
* are there any problems when tracking nested repositories, i.e. the Git and Mercurial repositories in my ~/.vim folder? Are there any notable advantages of using submodules in this case, except clarity?

I put the archive in my checkout folder (so I could map/alias it on my local test webserver). I now see how that was a bad idea, as I accidentally committed it a few commits ago. So now I have this lean project with a huge obsolete blob in the history.

I would like to remove it from my repos so later when things are public nobody has to download this big commit when they clone my project.

Note: it's still very early in the project (few days) and I'm still only one working on it, all locally/privately, so I can do ugly hacks if need be. I'd prefer to keep the rest of the history (before/after the mistake) but if there is no other way I can just export everything, ditch the file, reset my index and commit everything at once.

1369311053.0	1ewcz6	Is this achievable with Git? (4 Sites / 1 Repository)	IntricateRuin	9	2	20	"Hi all,

I have an interesting problem, that I am sure is manageable with Git with the right knowledge.

We currently run 4 sites (ASP.NET C#) which all share exactly the same server-side code, kept in .cs files. The only difference between the sites are the main view files (.aspx/.ascx) and CSS/Javascript. I'm wondering what the best way is to manage this with Git without creating 4 separate repositories (If even possible).

Currently all the server-side code is kept in Git, and works a treat. However the front-end files in our repository are a mixture of each site, and can't be trusted as the latest source. This unfortunately means if a front-end change needs to made, the file has to be pulled down from the (live) server, modified and put back up.

I'd like to be able to get the benefits of Git with the front-end files too. Suppose foo.aspx and bar.aspx are the same page, but for different sites - we could update foo.aspx, commit changes and leave the other untouched (bad example, but suppose a banner/promotion needs changing on one site only).

Our deployment process at the moment is still very manual (FTP, boo) so I understand that we would have to make sure the correct front-end files go to the correct place.

I have had someone suggest branching to do this, but am wondering if there is a better way - Branching would require us to have a production/staging branch for each of the sites front-end files, as well as a production/staging for the server-side stuff. Any server-side change would need to be merged into each of the 4 others, which is not ideal.

Is what I am trying to do achievable with some fancy Git-magic that i'm not aware of?

Hi,

I'm learning the language Go at the moment. Go allows you to import packages from git repos by writing the command: 

    go get github.com/name/repo

This basically translates into a git clone command.

When I run the go command, I get the following error:

    package github.com/someone/web: exec: ""git"": executable file not found in $PATH 

After looking around the web for an answer, I came to the conclusion that there is an issue with my $PATH variable. But after researching that, I did not find any answers. Some places told me to chmod some dirs, but I'm wary of doing that without knowing the effects it might have.

I am working with a team of developers and we are working with one main repo. In that repo, we have one branch which is the main production branch. We have people working on this code who do not like git (SVN users who will not let go of the dark ways and accept branching) and a couple of cowboys who will commit code straight to the main production branch.

We do not want to use the dictator workflow because we cannot rely on just one person to review changes before they are added in to the production branch. We can use git blame if some one adds bad code but we get the ""I've been chewed out before"" reaction. Or because they do not know how to branch. (We have had a number of discussions on this)

I want to introduce a code review system where you can only commit to the main branch when two people have signed-off on the code. This means that two people will be responsible for saying this code is good to go in to production. It also means that two people have looked at the code.

Thoughts?

I finally thought I had it figured out. After loads of pain, torment and Stack Overflow, I was finally able to get everything that I had been working on in the subversion repo. Just to make sure that I was starting from a clean plate, I mothballed my old git repo and recloned a new subversion repo.

    git svn clone --prefix=svn/ url://fuck.it -s

Dandy. Now I create a new branch and check said branch out locally

    git svn branch svn/devhub
    git checkout -b local/devhub svn/devhub

Great, everything looks great, so I've checked out my branch and start working. A few local commits and its time to push something to our staging site and demo it (I work on a VM day to day).

    git svn rebase

Oh, huh, that worked well. Up to date, moving on:

    git svn dcommit

Stellar, now I can do my thing, demo and get back to work. A couple of iterations later, its time to move back into trunk. Someone has since made changes, so I need to get their code merged with mine.

    git rebase local/trunk

Oh, that's weird, I guess its trying to resolve conflicts for each and every commit. I guess I'd really just rather merge here, but I keep hearing that that's a huge mistake if I'm planning on committing to svn. So, I spend the next 20 minutes resolving conflicts for bullshit commits that I don't want to even be considered. Ok fine, lets just bail and I heard about this interactive thing.

    git rebase local/trunk -i

Pick, squash, squash, ... , edit. Cool, I'm just going to get everything down to two or three commits, and that'll be great. Wait, why is it still trying to resolve these conflicts for squashed commits. All right, fuck it, I need to deploy. `add . --continue` rinse repeat.

Ok, now I'm seriously fucked. All I really wanted was to merge (but I'm not supposed to merge, right?) a branch to trunk, pick my changes and trunk's changes and be done. Instead 3 hours have gone on, and I'm going through every last file manually resolving conflicts.

What gives?

I'm really trying to introduce git to my new company, they want to switch, but have a lot invested in svn. I need to learn this so I can make the transition look smooth. As it is, I'm starting to think that it would just be a lot easier to work in svn because every time I make a change to anything I'm in conflict hell for hours. I've rtfm, I've read blog post and watched videos, and I'm just about to finally get over the hump, but I need help.

My project has two big branches, both under constant development.  I'm always Cherry Picking between the two, as fixes and updates to one branch often apply to the other.  I did my usual thing this morning, added a method to the end of a file in the *version_2* branch, committed just that one addition, and then tried to cp that commit into the *legacy_version* branch.

The cp failed with a conflict.  I open up the conflicted file and see that my cp brought TWO new methods into the *legacy_version* branch, not just the very latest one.

I cancel the cp, and go back for a second look at things:

    git checkout version_2
    git diff HEAD~1..HEAD

which returns:
    
    		def a_method_recently_added_to_VERSION_2_but_not_LEGACY_VERSION
    			return the_result
    		end
    +
    +		def my_new_method
    +			return the_result
    +		end
    	end
    end

Hmm, that looks ok.  I then go back to *legacy_version* and cp again.

    git checkout legacy_version
    git cherry-pick 0d6e7a5

I get the same result as the first time.  Here's what the conflict looked like:

    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
    =======
    		def a_method_recently_added_to_VERSION_2_but_not_LEGACY_VERSION
    			return the_result
    		end
    
    		def my_new_method
    			return the_result
    		end
    	end
    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 0d6e7a5... Added a my_new_method
    end

So, for some reason, the cp took the last two methods from *version_2* and added them into *legacy_version*.  I expected it to just add the *my_new_method* to the *legacy_version*.

This totally goes against my understanding of git - can anyone explain why this happened?  I can give a better description of the relationships between the branches, and the files in those branches, but sadly I cannot give actual history :/

Any help greatly appreciated - I was sure I 'understood' how git works!  It seems I do not.

I've already read that Git doesn't support windows symlinks or hard links... so I realize I'm pretty much out of luck there working on the Windows platform... 

So here's my question: I'm new to git and maybe overlooking it... does git offer any sort of ""reference this file in multiple places"" feature?

Specifically, I have a setup of directories like so:

- Chrome [contains Chrome extension specific files]
- Safari [contains Safari extension specific files]
- XPI [contains Firefox XPI extension specific files]
- Opera [contains Opera extension specific files]
- lib [contains the one big honkin' JS file that handles *most* of Reddit Enhancement Suite

Now, a copy of the js file from /lib needs to live in /Chrome, /Safari, /XPI/data, and /Opera/includes

For my own purposes, I have a windows symlink from each of those 4 directories to /lib/reddit_enhancement_suite.user.js so that I don't have to copy the file to the other directories (or write a build script, which would ultimately be OS specific)...

Minor catch: Safari's extension builder ignores symlinks, so that link is a hard link.

For now, I've just ignored the symlinks in git. If you check RES out of git right now, you've gotta set up the links yourself.

I've been using Dropbox to co-ordinate some Eclipse projects across three machines. However, they're now all producing output into the Dropbox at conflicting times, and I don't want them overwriting each other. So I'm going to start committing this output to a git repo, so I don't lose track of what got created when.

I've just successfully added my existing filesystem to a git repository. However, now I'm faced with getting the other two machines to be able to use the same repository. Given that they have all the .git files in their Dropboxes now too, but do not have git set up on the machine, should there be any complications? If I set git up correctly on all three machines, will they be able to share this shared repository?

I realise this is an absurd situation, a symptom of switching to version control a week before a paper deadline. Can anyone let me know if I'm getting myself into a spot here?"	t5_2qhv1	True

More importantly, I've been sorting through pretty much every song released to sort out ""bad"" songs. 

I really want some way I could share this entire collection in a way that would allow me to frequently update, and ideally allow other people to help me build it. This means that I need to be able to easily add music to the collection, and people should be able to easily check for and get new content. 

Git was my first thought, but I know it wouldn't handle music very well. I heard some good things about Git-annex, but I currently don't have linux on any of my machines, and wanted to get an opinion before I started reformatting and dual booting things. 

Are there any other services that would be able to do this? I've considered paying for a few gigs of dropbox if there was enough interest, but if I wanted to allow other people to change things, it would have to be trust-based.

I'm trying to get the hang of git before my group migrates to it sometime by the end of summer, I'm being proactive so to speak. I've got git installed on my linux box at home as well as various clients (smartgit, sourcetree, msysgit, tortoise - and just native git on another linux box).

Here's the scenario I'm trying to work through:

I have a repo on my ""server"" that I am able to clone from anywhere in my network. It's already a git repo because I ran 'git init &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m ""initial commit""' within it. Git works fine from that directory on that box.

Dealing with it as a remote...not so much luck.

So on my client machine I am able to clone the repo successfully. I can see the changes and files. If I add a new file to the repo, for example ""test.sh"", correctly stage it and then commit that change locally, I try to push the change back to the server and I get this message:

&gt;refusing to update checked out branch: refs/heads/master
 By default, updating the current branch in a non-bare repository
 is denied, because it will make the index and work tree inconsistent
 with what you pushed, and will require 'git reset --hard' to match
 the work tree to HEAD.
 
&gt; You can set 'receive.denyCurrentBranch' configuration variable to
 'ignore' or 'warn' in the remote repository to allow pushing into
 its current branch; however, this is not recommended unless you
 arranged to update its work tree to match what you pushed in some
 other way.
 
&gt; To squelch this message and still keep the default behaviour, set

To ssh://kaosx@haf:/home/kaosx/liquidprompt/
! [remote rejected] master -&gt; master (branch is currently checked out)
error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://kaosx@haf:/home/myuser/liquidprompt/'


essentially what I want to be able to do is
*clone (I'm used to ""checking out"", so please correct me if I'm wrong) a repository
*make my changes or add/delete files
*locally commit those changes
*push those changes to the remote system(server)

1360704339.0	18efmh	Forcing Re-review of submitted patches 	__r99f8f9	6	0	3	"This is a spiritual followup to my earlier post: http://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/176xpu/nongerrit_code_review_options/


Since it is looking like it is the best option, my group is currently trying out Gerrit in a sandbox to see how well we can adjust to changes in workflow.  Most of it is minor adjustments, but I can't figure out access settings to enable the following scenario...


Starting with a somewhat 'git-flow' type set up, we have our 'master' branch for releases, 'dev' for day to day work, and other branches for features or whatever.
  

What I would like to set up in gerrit is:  
  * Only Leads can push to 'master'  
  * Anything going to 'dev' needs to be reviewed  
  * Sandbox branches generally don't need to be reviewed, but can be if desired  


At first blush, that's easy to configure.  Branches prefixed with 'sandbox/*' have direct push and submit for review rights.  Dev only has submit for review rights.  Master has direct push rights for a specific group.


The problem that I've run into with that configuration is that Gerrit treats anything that makes it to the committed side as ""reviewed"" and it can be fed through the system again with out creating a review request.  So a developer can create a commit, push it directly up to 'sandbox/featureBranch', rebase onto 'dev', and then push it up to 'dev' without ever having had the code verified or reviewed by another.


Ideally, I would like anything going to 'dev' to be reviewed regardless of past review status. I cannot find a setting for this so far though.  I'd prefer not to make it required that every submit on every branch gets reviewed for various reasons^1, but that seems to be the only option so far.


Anyone have any other suggestions?



1 - Various reasons including but not limited to of:  
  * Encouraging people to use branches for preliminary work and only merging to dev when done  
  * Allowing exploratory work to not require review  
  * Making collaboration on a feature between multiple developers easier  
  * Backing up code to a central server rather then keeping it all local until done  



EDIT:  
It might be doable if I enable pushing merges to dev for review.  So one can work on a branch, merge it with dev and then push that merge for review (since it can have a new commit ID).  Not sure if I can force only merge commits though.


EDIT 2:  
This appears to be the same issue: http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=1142  
Need to investigate the patch to see if it should be applied. (ninja edit: Nope... it looks like that is a slightly different issue)

EDIT 3:  
I should have read that bug more closely.  This patch linked looks like it might exactly be the situation I've described.  Too bad it hasn't been updated since Oct  
https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/32881/

EDIT 4:  
That patch doesn't merge easily with 2.5.2 code, so I have made everything require review (and a few other controls to project owner only land).  Having just learned about the rule engine, that might be a way to do this in the future if I decide to explore it again:

Now, my question is: can I safely unset the value of HEAD to not point to any particular branch? 

The goal is that any user that clone the repo has to explicitly checkout a branch (whichever branch the user prefers). Of course, it's a mystery to me what would the working directory would like if so (maybe just the .git folder?)

Project Layout:

Codeigniter Application - Frontend Public Website

Codeigniter Application - Backend Local Administrative Website

Mac OSX Git Tower and Github

&lt;br /&gt;

So I have two CI applications, the public website which is accessible to the outside world, and a backend administrative website that is locally saved.  Both of the projects use much of the same codebase helpers, libraries, and models are pretty much identical between the two.  The code that is different are the Views and Controllers which use classes from my libraries and models.

My typical workflow is to work locally and then push to github to keep a remote copy of my code.  I find myself working on one of the applications and then copying and pasting my code changes to the other project, this isn't ideal and I think I could use submodules to keep the code changes the same across both projects.

I use Git in a very limited capacity, push, pull, etc.  But i'd like to learn more.  So my question is if anyone had any good tutorials, tips, or strategies in using submodules in the helping me organize my projects it would be a huge help!  Thank you!

Sometimes I want to store binaries (e.g., photos) on the wiki, but don't care to include the huge binary blob in my repository.  I could store the images elsewhere on my server, and just have references to those URLs in the wiki, or...

So, Git has trees and blobs, right?  And trees contain pointers to blobs by `SHA-1`, and label those hashes with a filename, and mode. (I'm working from the description at &lt;http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Internals-Git-Objects&gt;, by the way.)

Is it possible to ""add"" a file to a tree without actually adding the referred blob to the repository?  Intended behavior:

* Adding the file adds a reference to the blob-that-would-be to the tree.
* Changing the file indicates that the file has changed, but re-adding it only updates the hash in the tree.
* If the file is missing, it is marked as absent / deleted in `git status`, but it can be retrieved from backup by hash if necessary.

So, basically, I want a `.gitignore` that only ignores the binary blob, not the reference in the tree.

As [technoweenie pointed out](http://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/q311w/help_my_github_remote_is_broken_support_isnt_much/c3uh9rg), it seems there was a bad entry seemingly caused by Gerrit(?). I can only assume it got there when I decided to try a trial version of Zend Studio bundled with egit, as looking at it now it does make reference to Gerrit code reviews in the commit dialog. I had ignored it, not knowing what it was. I guess I should have learned more about the tool set before using it.

Thanks for everyone's help, and happy coding!

Hi, /r/git! I apologize if this post somehow violates this reddit's rules or etiquette, but I'm at a total loss, and reddit has always been a huge help to me before.

I have a project hosted at GitHub, and I've been happily working on it for a while now. Nothing too fancy, just the basic add/commit/push with a little branch/merge/tag thrown in. My project is hooked into Travis CI, and the other day I pushed a minor documentation change and got a failing build notification, which was odd since I didn't touch the code. The logs indicated that Travis was unable to clone the repository to even attempt a build. I attempted to make a fresh clone myself, and got this error:

    error: refs/remotes/origin/master does not point to a valid object!
    error: Trying to write ref refs/heads/master with nonexistent object 15dcb6deae4a1850e36a6df8fa66032a35b2d1b0
    fatal: Cannot update the ref 'HEAD'.

I tried to fetch into an out-of date clone on another system and got the same error. I rolled back the commit with a hard reset and forced a push to GitHub (acting on advice from GitHub support). So then I could clone and fetch again, but any new push, no matter what it is, breaks it again.

Deciding to experiment, I created a new project on GitHub and pushed my master branch there. I'm able to work in that project just fine, it doesn't seem to break at all. Following advice from GitHub, I deleted my master branch on the broken project at GitHub and pushed my master from the working project into the broken one. Once again, clones from the broken project fail, while the fork works perfectly even though they have identical masters.

Each time, the object in the error reflects the latest commit. Obviously the hash changes, but it's always the most recent commit.

Does anybody have any idea what's going on? I'd like to salvage my broken project, as it has quite a few followers and logged issues, plus I have links in the wild pointing to it and its related gh-pages site. GitHub support doesn't seem too motivated to help me (I'm not a paying user).

We are building a CMS that is going to be the basis of several different sites my company is producing. So there will be a bunch of code which is the 'core', then different customisations of this which will become the various sites we build.

Every now and then we would add a new feature to core, and then want that feature to be rolled out to certain sites that are using the core.

What is the best way to manage this in git? One way is to create a branch for each site we build, but then every site will live in one giant repository.

Is there a recommended way to handle this? The core CMS is Drupal if that makes a difference.

Obviously it can be extracted if you happen to know its object ID, I'm just wondering if there's an easier way.

with this, you define a second environment variable called GIT_SSH_KEY and use both.

Essentially we have a repo with our entire app, including the theme, hosted at bitbucket. We have cloned that repo and are making changes to the theme to suit the new website. We are still actively developing the ""parent"" theme though to fix bugs, and need to pull those bug fixes in to the cloned repo without screwing up the customizations that we've made to the theme in the cloned repo. Does that make sense? 

Essentially, we went like this:

Master Theme--&gt;Cloned to Child Theme
Customizations made to master theme
Different Customizations made to child theme (IE these two sites look completely different now)
Bug fix made in master theme and committed
Now we want to pull that bug fix in from the master repo WITHOUT pulling in the theme customizations / overwriting the theme customizations that we made in the child repo.

The problem is that in the future the branches will be merged, and I want the commit to be not-reverted in the merged results.

The ways that I found are: 

* revert on both branches, and re-apply from patch

* revert on one branch, merge, and cherry-pick the commit to re-apply it. (but I don't know if I'll be allowed to merge these two yet)

Why I'm doing it? because it is a fix to a bug, but it was decided not to include this fix in this version, (because of QA time) and hop it to the next version.

Edit: the first method doesn't seen to work.

Edit2: I opt to the second method, reverting the changes on branch 1, merging it to branch 2, and then reverting the revert commit on branch 2.

that way when branch 2 will be merged into branch 1 the revert^2 will hold.

However, I frequently find myself working on code that doesn't lend itself easily to small self-contained commits. Normally, I work in a dev branch where the head isn't necessarily usable, but I only merge it back into the master when it's at a stable point. For example, I might be working on some framework code that isn't usable until all the parts are in place, but i'll commit after each one and just merge when they're all done.

This clearly makes it hard to automate `git bisect`. Is there any good way to deal with this case? Rebase/squash commits before merging back with the master? Is there a clean way to keep the full history in one branch and the ""always-OK"" history in the master?

1353922870.0	13t18j	Questions regarding rebasing with a team.	gfixler	3	0	9	"I've become quite adept at `rebase` and `rebase --onto`, but I've only used them in my own personal repo. I don't work with anyone else who uses git, sadly, so I don't have community experience yet. As such, there are some things I don't understand about rebase when used on a team.

1) I know it's frowned upon to push rebased commits to a branch others are working from. I'm not sure if there's something I'm missing, but I do this to myself all the time by pushing heavily-rebased branches from work to home and back again. I do a fetch, and then it's easy to rebase onto the changes. Is there something else I'm missing here that makes this so difficult to deal with, or bad in some other way I don't see?

It's strange to me to work on a branch and not rebase along the entire time to make sure it works entirely with the very latest master, right up until merging back in, at which point you'd never have a merge bubble, and the code would effectively just replay on top of the master branch to get rolled back in, creating a single chain of history. If you don't do this, you're hoping that the code all just works once it's merged back in, no? The only reason I like commit bubbles is for seeing a bunch of work as a separated-out branch, but it feels arbitrary, too. The only reason it branches from a particular point is that's when the person started working on it (or it's the last place onto which they rebased). It seems pointless to me to have parallel branches that effectively keep the feature/fix/whatever from knowing about the latest stuff in master (or wherever) until it's all merged together at the end. The commits the branch skips over in master seem skipped over for no reason, and I don't like it. What's the benefit?

3) As I said, I've only worked alone so far, so I don't understanding rebasing onto master when working with others. How do teams that want to, say, have 3 people break off and work on a feature together, pulling from each other for a week or two before merging back in to master do this? Is there a branch leader who pulls the original, the others pull from that person, and the leader pulls back from them? This would allow that person to keep rebasing onto master to stay in sync, pulling from others, and ultimately merging it all back in, but it means the others would be out of sync. Does each person rebase onto master at will, also pulling back and forth from each other, and then one person pulls all the separate pieces together to merge back in? Does no one rebase onto anything during this process? This is a complex relationship, and I'm wondering how people handle it."	t5_2qhv1	True

So I've been thrown in the deep end by a client, giving me access to a CentOS VM where I need to deploy the site we've built up for them in the past months to go live. Trouble is I normally don't work in an environment like this. I'm not even sure how to use the httpd server properly yet.

Everything is ready to deploy from Github - but I can't 'git clone' my repo. 

**SSH error message:**

&gt;Initialized empty Git repository in /var/www/html/project/.git/

I'll be asking my boss tomorrow what could possibly be going wrong here ... trouble is I'm facing an openly hostile group of system admins. Can anyone familiar with command line deployments point me in a direction where I can at least figure out if it's a problem with my setup, or if I just need to assume the network is locked down and preventing me from deploying. If it's the latter, do I need to request port 22 be opened for this machine for an SSH deployment?

For the record the machine does have internet connectivity. I've deployed a number of applications via Yum and can successfully ping Google. Also running git 1.7.1

1327783771.0	p0utc	Splitting a large SVN repo into several smaller git repos	classicrockielzpfvh	3	0	7	"The SVN repo in question is just under 1GB but it still takes forever to clone it from place to place. On top of that, several of us are sick of dealing with it and it's entirely our responsibility to manage. We came to the consensus that we'd use git, and the responsibility fell to me to transition the repository (since I was the person who argued most for git).

We also agreed that we'd split the repository into about 5 new repositories. This could easily be done in a lazy way just by copying directories and files into the new repositories, running git add . and going on our merry way. I'd like to preserve the history of everything though.

From what I can tell, there should be away to split the repositories into new SVN repos and then run git-svn from there. So the first question I have is this:

1) When I run 'svnadmin dump ./directory &gt; svnrepo.directory.dump' svnadmin provides the error message:
""Can't open file 'directory/format': No such file or directory""
Which begs the question (having never used SVN myself and only being here for a couple weeks and thereby never having to use it) what the hell is the format file? I can't find one anywhere in the repository.

2) Is there a more intelligent way of doing this?

3) If there isn't, is this at least the correct way to resolve it once I resolve the missing 'format' file issue?

* Workflow is clear to any new dev (who may not know how git)

**Idea**

* Master - singular commit for each version (squash all commits in version branch when version complete)

* Develop - main working branch

* 1.0-wip - version/feature branches

* 1.0-squash - when a version is finished create a squash branch, rebase all commits into one, and merge with master. delete branch when done.


**Issues**

* Not sure how to deploy rapid hot fixes to prod

* Unsure if the faff of squashing branches into single commits for master would be worthwhile (would look really neat though!)

i did everything it it, but when i try to push to the remote server i get the following error:

    libexec/git-core/git-receive-pack (line 22) 
    gitster-git-0bb2ee1/git-upload-archive: no such file or directory


now i thought this was an issue with the way my local box connects to remote box via SSH...so i attempted to mimic the local box in the remote box by simply creating a new directory in remote and setting the ""git remote"" origin to point to remote box's git repo locally.

but i still get the same error. (keep in mind when i did the same thing on my local box, i was able to push fine).


anyone have experience with this? thanks alot


**ps: i would like to point out i do NOT have root access in the remote server. git is installed user side (user/bin), but i AM able to run any git command on the remote (like git init --bare, git push pull etc etc)

I chose to use plink.exe as described, and merrily gave it the path to the plink binary. So far, so good. local commits/branching worked well, so I moved on to my goal: setting up a central repository on one of my linux servers here so that I had a better means of shuffling code between different dev boxes floating around here (replacing the old 'stick it on a samba share and copy it down; branch by adding a 1 to the filename' method). 

My problems came when I tried this. Git refused to connect to the box after I set up my keys, verifying that auto login worked with PuTTY (it did). whenever I tried connecting via Git, it told me the server host key had changed. Curious as to why, I fired up wireshark, and discovered it was trying to connect to the IP listed in my PuTTY config under 'Default settings'; which was different to the git server IP. I tried to work around this by modifying the default config to point to the Git server. This worked, but now I received a 'Fatal: Server unexpectedly closed connection', as well as a pair of malformed packets in wireshark. 

Confused, and just wanting it to work, I decided to try the ssh.exe binary that came with Git. I first modified the values in the git.config file I found in the program directory - no love. Then I tried uninstalling Git, and reinstalling, making sure to choose 'Use Openssl' this time rather than plink - same again. Git stubbornly refused to try with anything other than plink. I uninstalled PuTTY entirely, then Git, then reinstalled Git (this time i got no option as to what ssh to use, I asssume it checks for PuTTY during install) - same result.

In frustration, I typed env | grep GIT_SSH:

GIT_SSH=C:\Program Files\PuTTY\plink.exe

Argh. Modified this to point to ssh.exe, and presto. works.

Now that the long windedness is done with, my ultimate query is: Is this a Git bug, or did I do something silly here; does Git pull this environment variable from somewhere nontrivial, and this was a remnant from my initial attempt using plink? I made an attempt at scrubbing my system between installs to try and avoid this, but I'm curious if there was a step that was missed.

I find this extremely annoying so I've created the following script to fix the config easily:

    #!/bin/bash
    remote=${1:?'missing remote'} branch=${2:?'missing branch'}
    if [[ $3 ]]; then
        git_args=(config -f ""$3"")
    else

        echo ""${var#branch.$branch.}=$val""

you use it like this: `script &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt; [&lt;config-file&gt;]` and it'll adjust your repo using the `git config` command to add or change the tracking.

Why do software developers have git and we, mechanical developers, have nothing?

Having followed several open source hardware projects, I have seen document management ranging from poor to truly terrible. As I see it we need a open source product data management system (PDM), designed to support community-based development of physical products. 
 
This leads to my question: “Can Git, being a SCM solution, be reconfigured to function as a PDM solution within reasonable efforts?”

To my knowledge there are many differences in how you handle software and hardware data in software configuration management (SCM) and product data management (PDM) respectively. This relates to the fundamental difference data representation in these two systems.

• PDM manages objects, SCM manages files and directories

PDM uses an object oriented data model where data is represented via a business item connected to a data item, i.e. PDM makes a difference between business items and one or more data items (files). A business item is an entity in a database with metadata describing it, while a data item is the actual file.

The data representation in SCM is more or less a file system with directories and files. Anything represented as a file or directory may be managed and stored in SCM (all kind of file types and objects). The metadata is stored together with the file itself and not in a separate database

Let's just say it isn't an easy problem to deal with, and even harder to explain, so bear with me. If someone knows other good git forums to post this in, let me know! (This isn't exactly git tech support, but not sure where else to post)

Here's the very basics of my particular problem:
I need to setup a hook script on our server (update or post-update) that gives me the full contents of all files changed since previous commit, not compressed. This turns out to be more difficult than it sounds. First step, getting a list of all files changed, is pretty easy (git diff --name-only &lt;rev1&gt; &lt;rev2&gt;)

The challenging part is getting the contents of these files. Getting the diff's is easy enough, but I don't want the diff's. These files have to be uploaded to a remote server. Furthermore, the git server doesn't store a working directory, so I need git to export the files.

The ""easy way"" is to run git checkout-index on the entire repo into a temp dir, and then pull the files I need from the temp directory. 

Problem is for large repos, I am writing 50-100MB to the disk to pull out a single 5KB file change. git checkout-index can supposedly pull out a single file, but it can't run from update or post-update hooks, because the new file data hasn't been written yet! Gah!

Still trying new ideas, but I feel like I'm chasing my tail. Anyone else have experience in this area?

Any insights would be helpful.

I have a project with one branch and one master, the branch being 'beta'. I can successfully add and remove files from the beta branch but when I try to commit+merge any changes from this branch to the master is where the problems come in.

The merge can successfully add the files and also make changes to the files, but when I remove a certain file from the 'beta' branch and commit that change to the master, the file does not get removed.

This is probably an easy fix but I can't seem to find a reason as to why this is happening.

I am the only developer on a small project which I want to safeguard (at this point) with git.

So I created a git repository and added and committed my files. When I make an update, I commit all the files again.

Do I need to do anything more? I may in the future look into using it to handle release, or another developer may join in, but right now I am not worried about that, so I don't think I need to know about push and pull yet, or the branching/merging capabilities of git.

1364102894.0	1awgp3	Is it possible to rebase multiple branches together?	gfixler	3	3	0	"I'm pretty sure the answers is no, but leaving aside all of the ""Why would you ever want to do that?"" and ""That's a terrible idea!"" and the cautionary ""Don't ever rebase commits other people are using!"" replies for a moment, is it possible to rebase branches together?

Let's say I have a tool branch, and then a branch off of that for some tests against that tool with proprietary data that I want to both keep versioned alongside the tool, but also keep out of anything I'm going to push out eventually. The basic idea is that I'm developing the tool for a company need, but making it generic so that it can be used for other things one day.

So, I work on the tool, and after getting something working, I want to test it with the proprietary data, so I switch to the proprietary test branch, merge in the tool branch, do my tests, and all is well. Eventually, maybe a few hours later I've done this a couple of times, and I realize I'd like to interactively rebase the tool branch to fix a stupid mistake 15 granular commits ago. If I do this, however, it changes history and makes a new, single commit outside of the old tool branch, which is expected. However, this orphans the test branch, and all of its merges from the old tool branch.

It seems like it would be possible - and maybe part of git already, though I doubt it - to rebase these things together, in context with each other. This would essentially replay the merge commits as well. It seems fraught with peril, and it goes against the ""don't rebase branches in use by others"" tenet, my test branch being the other user in this case, but it still seems like it should be possible, and not such a terrible thing if I'm staying inside the area I've not pushed anywhere - i.e. staying inside my commits from the last few hours.

I've also considered making the test branch a separate repo that pulls the tool in as a submodule, but similar problems arise, with even less of a chance of things remaining coherent. The commit hashes in the test repo would no longer point to the active branch commits in the tool repo."	t5_2qhv1	True
1363005103.0	1a2u0l	How do you keep your commit history clean in a team environment?	jknecht	1	1	0	"I work on a team with 10 other developers.  We are using git-flow to manage our feature development and a shared github repository to share and back-up our code.  So far, and for the most part, this works amazingly well and we are extremely happy with it.

All the advice I've seen says that 'rebase' is used to keep your commit history clean, but that you should never use it once your branch has been pushed to a remote repository.  I understand the argument that ""rewriting history is a bad thing to do once the code has been published"".

My problem is that we have 10 feature branches going simultaneously.  Each of these features branches lives for anywhere from 2 to 7 days before being merged to 'develop' - that is a LOT of change over the course of a two week sprint.

I merge from develop at least daily just so I can be sure I'm not going to have a huge conflict at the end.  **If I have a feature branch that has been out there for 10 days or more, my commit history becomes an absolute mess.**  I don't want to keep all that code on my local machine for that whole time (paranoid about hard drive failures), so I push to 'origin' frequently; but this means that I can't rebase.

I know you are going to say ""make smaller branches"".  That is not an option in this case.

**How can I keep my commit history clean in this kind of environment?**

For what it's worth, feature branches are generally only worked on by a single person, so collaboration is not necessarily a concern.

The problem seems to be stemming from a config file that FlashDevelop modifies from time to time.

My question is, what do I do with this new change? It seems like it would be ideal to discard it in this case, as I haven't decided on which rollback to merge into master, as I'm still seeking the problem.

I use SVN at work, and for my home use I decided to use Git (after a bit of reading on why it is better). 

It was more than a year ago that I spent days trying to setup git (the command line thing) to work with bitbucket. Been using it for the last year with just 3 simple commands:

1. git add -a

2. git commit

3. git push &lt;repo name&gt;

I just bought a new laptop and am trying to use set up git to use my respositories from bitbucket. It is such a pain with running some commands, modifying files, creating new files with filenames starting with a dot. And even after following everything word for word, I am not able to use the SSH thing to log on to my bitbucket.



Sorry for the rant, but I don't think using a source control should be this difficult really. It should be as simple as pointing to a url for the repository, putting in a username and password and done.

I don't mind using the command line in place of a UI, but the setting up part is crazy. Why is it this tough?

So what can a guy to do remove a string of commits from a particular branch?

Am I right in thinking if I rebase the staging branch and skip over the troublesome commits, pushing that to my origin will fuck things up?  It's not like the origin will have my 'fixed' branch, it'll just be *merged* with my 'fixed' branch.

I resolved my issues by using git-revert, and working through each merge conflict.  I think 4 of the 12 commits conflicted, but they were simple one liners.  My earlier attempts at reverting these commits failed because I didn't revert back far enough, due to my misunderstanding the range rules.

I wanted to remove commits from 028fd0d to 0fc7169 inclusive, so I did a *git revert 028fd0d..0fc7169*, when I should have moved one commit further back and done a *git revert 659f221..0fc7169*.

I've been trying to learn Git and figured the best way to learn it is to use it.  But I can't seem to find what the Git Bash equivalents of the cmd.exe directory navigation commands are, like cd, dir, mkdir, etc.
The only two I know are cd(change dir) and mkdir.

My second question is how does git handle spaces in filenames.  I am trying to navigate to a folder to make it into a repo, but a containing folder has a space in it's name and I can't seem to figure out how git wants to read that name.

Thanks for any advice you can offer me."	t5_2qhv1	True
