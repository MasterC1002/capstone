We never thought we'd have to give this warning but one of our moderators sent his $400 SuperMicro server board back to ""a well known store"" for RMA. Like most of us he's a very experienced builder and has bought from this store on many occasions. To our utter amazement the store now claims he has bent pins on his mainboard socket and we have no reason to assume this is in any way true.

Regardless, we feel we should warn our readers to ALWAYS take pictures and collect whatever other proof you can on the condition of items you send back to an online store.

Apparently being a good customer is not enough to protect you from dishonest stores or store employees so please don't rely on your customer relationship with any store to protect you from this.

We've probably all heard stories like this one before but now that this is happening to people ordering stuff professionally we feel it necessary to post a PSA about this.

Feel free to share any similar stories you may have in the comments.

Thanks for reading!

Please avoid questions that might help identify me. My intentions are to be a non-marketing source of information and internal opinions that do not reflect the opinions of AMD (my employer). I need to preserve my anonymity to keep doing this. Hopefully this won't be too boring :). 

 1) Why are you doing this? 

I love computer hardware and gadgets in general, just like you guys, and I hate it when all that we're given is marketing fluff. Thanks to Twitter and social media in general, we're seeing a lot more personal connection with some companies (Logitech, for instance, has been pretty awesome at this). Still though, we rarely hear from the people who help design and make this stuff. So in a small part, I'd like to help change that. 

 2) Catalyst Drivers

I'm seeing a lot of hate (some of which is pretty nasty) for the Catalyst team, so I figured I'd just address this at the top: 

The Catalyst driver suite used to be a mess... it was hard to use, it was unreliable, and it didn't have the full set of features that it needed to. I hear the ""I love AMD GPUs but their drivers are a mess"" complaint in real life too, and that's usually followed up by them saying they haven't used one of our GPUs for years. 

Our *modern* Catalyst drivers are great, in my opinion. Almost all of us on the design side are gamers too, and nobody screams louder about an end-user driver problem than we do. Compared to NVIDIA, I think we're at parity with them in terms of bug rate, stability (some argue that we're actually *more* stable than NVIDIA), and feature set, especially after the 12.1 release. Does having a driver quality similar to NVIDIA mean that the drivers are where they should be? *ABSOLUTELY NOT*. Both companies have a long way to go before they're where they should be, IMO. A gamer should *never* have to open the control panel, but that same gamer should *always* have the option of going in and tweaking everything their heart desires. And personally knowing some of the driver team, I know how hard they're working to make this a reality.

EDIT: I'm getting more than a few PMs of people asking how to learn more about GPUs and graphics programming. I love this- being motivated to self-teach is a fantastic attribute. 

-I'd suggest learning OpenGL first. It's very easy to find free tutorials online. A good place to start is http://openglbook.com/. There are also lecture series offered by several schools for free. 

-NVIDIA's GPU Gems Series is awesome, and they're [free](http://developer.nvidia.com/content/gpu-gems-part-i-natural-effects) now. 

-AMD did their first Fusion Developer's Summit last year. Many of the keynotes are available [here](http://developer.amd.com/afds/pages/2011_Highlights.aspx). If you want to learn about our latest architecture and the future of heterogenous computing, check these out.

I thought I'd finally get around to share with you my first ever watercooling build, which is a rebuild of my first and only pc build.  [Here is the worklog and pics](http://imgur.com/a/xqeIJ) of my two month process.

The build has been up and running with no problems since the beginning of September. Currently, I've got my GPU's at 1316Mhz core @ 1.175 volts, and my CPU is at 4.7GHz at 1.29 volts.  My temps have been phenomenal since watercooling, hell my GPU's barely reach 40C during intense gaming sessions, and my CPU struggles to hit 65C at full load.

This was an amazing learning experience, from cutting/crimping my own power cables to figuring out how to set up a full loop.  I learned a ton and hope to keep being able to make builds like this once I graduate med school in three years.

Here's the component list:

I RMA'd it to XFX and they warrantied it, due to their lifetime warranty on cards and are sending me back a 6950 (which isn't a huge upgrade) but I mentioned that I was running 2 of their XFX cards in Crossfire and the offered to start another RMA so I could return the other 5870 (that is still working) and they would replace it with another 6950

I must say I'm quite impressed that they offered to do that, I wasn't really sure what I was going to be stuck with after an older GPU bit the dust, but I must say that they have my vote of support :D

**Overclocking is not for laptops! It requires mainboard and BIOS support as well as better cooling, none of which are supported on any laptop. Laptops have slower processors for reasons of heat dissipation and power consumption, both of which would be compromised if you could overclock.**

___________

**A little warning**

First off, I want to tell you that there is always a certain risk involved in overclocking. Especially (but not exclusively) when you start playing with the voltages you run the risk of damaging your system. Be aware this is your risk to take and your warranty  on components may be limited or nonexistent if you run your components outside of factory specifications. In other words, do this at your own risk.

**Base clock (or reference clock)**

Okay, now that the inevitable warning is out of the way, let's get to the basics. Computers have one clock generator we need to be concerned with. This is often referred to as the base clock. This base clock normally runs at a speed of 200MHz. Other components derive their clock speed from this base clock through the use of what we call multipliers. The CPU uses this baseclock and it's multiplier for the CPU clock.

**Edit:** The Sandy Bridge reference clock defaults at 100MHz with higher default multipliers but the basic principles are the same: reference clock x multiplier = frequency. In the BIOS the Sandy Bridge multiplier is often called the *'CPU ratio'*.

**CPU multiplier**

The CPU uses the base clock and the CPU multiplier to get it's clock speed. For a common 3 GHz processor with a base clock of 200MHz the multiplier is set to 15 as 15 x 200MHz = 3000MHz =  3GHz.

**Locked CPU multiplier**

A locked multiplier usually means that the multiplier has a maximum setting that doesn't allow the CPU to be clocked past it's stock speed. In the case of the above mentioned 3GHz processor this means you can't set this multiplier past 15. You can still overclock the CPU but only by changing the base clock. If you would for instance set the base clock to 220MHz (an increase of 20MHz) the CPU clock would go from 3GHz to 220 x 15 = 3300MHz = 3.3GHz. The downside of this is that this method also increases the northbridge chip and the memory because they derive their clockspeeds from the same base clock.

**Unlocked CPU multiplier**

An unlocked CPU multiplier allows the multiplier to be set higher than it's stock value. If we take the earlier example of the 3GHz processor you could simply set the CPU multiplier to 16. That would result in the CPU running at 16 x 200MHz = 3200MHz = 3.2 GHz. All the while the other components (memory and northbridge) will continue to run at their stock values because the base clock remains unchanged at 200MHz!

**Temperatures and voltages**

Contrary to popular belief, the CPU temperature - when using a good aftermarket cooler - is usually not what's preventing you from overclocking. When clock frequencies get very high the circuits inside the CPU can start to have timing issues causing it to crash.

Another thing that can happen is that at high frequencies the CPU starts having trouble distinguishing the high and low parts of the clockcycle (think of a wave form that gets flattened so the difference between the high part and low part of the wave gets smaller). 

This second problem can be combatted by upping the voltages thus making the waveform sharper. This is however not a very good idea in most cases, so be wary of doing this! Higher voltages do result in higher temperatures but more importantly higher voltages can damage the circuits within the CPU!  If you want the least risk of damaging components then stay away from overvolting!

That's it for the first overclocking article on [/r/gamingpc](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc)! More articles on memory, northbridge and videocards will appear later this week and the week after that. (c) 2011: if you want to use this information on other places than this subreddit please contact the poster.

**Any questions, corrections or comments are welcome!**

[Part 2 is here (memory) &gt;&gt;](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/jliya/article_overclocking_basics_part_2_memory_first/)

Edit: a good point was made in the comments. Some mainboards regulate the voltage for you when you start tinkering with the clockspeeds. Personally I don't worry about that much but I don't push my systems to the far outer limits. Overclocking is always a gamble though much safer now than it used to be. Remember, it's always your risk to take though ;-)

just a quick housekeeping message that will hopefully keep us on topic. We are not - and never have been - a build help forum, this role is being filled by /r/buildapc.

If you are new to building PCs, post your help questions in /r/buildapc. The IRC channel was not created for build help questions either so we don't expect to see first time build help in there.

We are about hardware news, troubleshooting if all normal options are exhausted as well as occasional build help for very high-end systems (X79) that don't get any love elsewhere on reddit.

Thanks and happy gaming!

My buddies in the office (also redditors) and I are curious if any of you plan on picking up a 7970 (Tahiti XT) when it officially begins shipping on Monday. We'd also like to hear your honest opinions of them once you get them. Believe it or not, most of us haven't even seen it in action yet (mostly because our schedules are pretty crazy), but those who have gotten the chance to take one home have come back to work the next day with a pretty big smile. It was not an easy chip to make (both new architecture and a new TSMC process), but we're pretty thrilled with what we're seeing from our new baby so far. 

So if you get one, please let us know what you think- good and bad. We can take it :). But from what we've seen, we think you're going to like it. 

EDIT: To those asking if I'd send you one early- I'm still trying to figure out how to get one for myself :). Get in line! Upvotes for you all anyway :)

EDIT2: Some of you are looking for reviews- here's a [convenient list](http://pcper.com/news/Graphics-Cards/More-HD-7970-reviews-you-would-want-shake-stick)

**This subreddit is first and foremost about enthusiast level hardware.**

If you feel the need to point out how stupid people are for buying a $500 graphics card you'll have exactly 1 chance to do so here before we boot your ass back to /r/butthurt.

We are serious about this. If you can't stand to see people spend money on their hobby you are in the wrong place.

**Edit:** Budget questions have always been welcome here. These rules are here because building gaming PCs is a hobby for a great many people. One of the great things about building PCs is that there are many components to choose from that allow you to build your exact dream machine.

Watercooling, case lighting, case modding, cable sleeving and lots other stuff that people spend money on are not done for ""bang for the buck"" and we don't want people made to feel bad about spending money on their hobby. A GTX 590 is cool because it's cool. Not because of 3DMarks per dollar.

*If everybody always bought ""maximum bang for the buck"" we'd all still have a C64. And even though I loved that era, I for one am happy that I can play stuff like Battlefield 3 now.*

Lets see.  The 4 rotational drives are arranged in raid 10.  I bought them before the flooding so they cost about 400 for all 4. 

I use the patriot ssd for the OS and applications.  The OCZ drive is use for scratch space and I use a Steam moving tool to move a couple of games onto it.  I'll eventually use it for intel ssd caching on the raid volume when they finally release an updated driver for the x79 sometime mid 2012.  

I currently have the CPU overclocked to 4.7 ghz with 1.385 volts.  I haven't really played with it yet.  I'm fairly certain I could go higher.  Both gfx cards are overvolted to 1.25v and overclocked to 1ghz core and 1450 memory (1.175v 880 core, 1250 mem stock)  

And of course the rig is fully water cooled.  About $1200-1500 went into just the loop.   The loop requires 3 radiators to dissipate all the heat generated.  a 120 rad, a 360 rad, and a 480 rad have gone into this.  There are 11 exhaust fans and 2 intake fans.  The loop is fully controlled and monitored by the Aqua Computer Aquaero 5 xt controller. The device is fully independent of the OS.  It watches the water temp in 3 points along the loop (after every radiator) and 4 air temps.  It adjusts fan speeds and pump power using a number of conditions and inputs.  It's even wired so that it'll physically shut off power (via mechanical relay) to the system in case of critical error (critical water temp or pump malfunction).  There are too many functions to list them all.  ""Feature-packed"" doesn't even begin to cut it.

I tried to keep as much of the system inside the case as I could, but it's just not possible.  There are 4 fans on the side. But they're only turned on when I'm gaming.  The case is big, but not big enough to house 2x 480 rads, fans, and all the other WC gear.  Honestly, it took me several weeks of measuring and planning to have everything fit as well as it does.  I **do not** recommend this to anyone.  Please, do yourself a massive favor and buy a proper WC case.  

I made *all* of the power cables in this case.  This let me create exact lengths and exact specifications and plug spacing.  That was a massive task and took 3 weeks to do.  I do not recommend it.   It was a time consuming and tedious experiment.  Took me a week and a half to get good at it.  I went though 100 feet of wiring and almost 100 pins to get there.  The results are nice though.  



That's all that comes to my mind.  Let me know if anyone wants more info or a detailed explanation of anything I did.

For my next upgrade I'll be switching out the gfx cards to 4x 7970 or the Nvidia equivalent (no more dual-gpu cards).  But that is 8-10 months down the line.  When all the next-gen cards are released and driver support is mature, I'll pick the top dog and switch to that.


EDIT:  I'm running a 3x1 eyefinity setup using Asus VH222H. They're 21.5 inch screens running at 1920x1080 each.  For a combined desktop area of 5760x1080

It basically allows you to order a mousepad off your very own design, for the silly little price of 0,99$ (And that includes the shipping!)

For anyone interested:

1. Create an account on www.artscow.com (Remeber to disable the news emails, unless you actually want them. I havn't recieved any spam from them yet)

2. Go to this webpage: http://www.artscow.com/photo-gifts/mousepad/large-mousepad-160 and customize your mousepad.
Hint: Don't use a picture that is too dark. It might get a little wierd as the mousepads are a bit dark in colour.

3. Put it in your cart and go to checkout.

4. Fear not when you see the price being around the 10$ + postage!

5. Insert the coupon saying ""MOUSEPADFREE"" and see the price magically [vanish](http://www.vanish.dk/img/content/home/vanishhomeproduct3.png) into nothing!

6. Order :D

And some extras: I think it's only possible to order 1 mousepad per adress/account/IP (Well it won't let me order anymore, that is)

And it takes around 6-20 days before you recieve it. Depending where you live (Took 7 days here in Europe. I'm pretty sure they ship from Hong Kong)

----------------------------------------

_______________________________________

Hey gamingpc people. As usual I was reading through some posts on gaming PCs and as usual I got slightly annoyed by the question: *""how can I make sure I'm not bottlenecking anything""*. I could keep the answer very short by saying *""you can't""* but that won't really help I guess, so here is some info:

**What exactly is 'bottlenecking'?**

_____________________________________________

The bottlenecking **euphemism** *(sorry fishbulbx &amp; storelogix!)* is used to describe components that are mismatched performance-wise to the point that one component is held back by too slow a performance from another component. 
Most of you know this but saying it out loud helps get in to the nitty gritty of things.

Most often in PC building it is used to describe a mismatch between CPU and GPU. In the old days when processors were slow and single core this is something that happened frequently. I just saw the crosspost of the BF3 CPU article in /r/buildapc and people were bashing it to hell for 'not accounting for bottlenecking'. Since I didn't want to join the bashing party (and a comment is too short for explaining this properly) I thought I'd address why this is bullshit in a post instead, knowing that people here actually read before they conclude ;-)

__________________________________________________

Let's start off with 1 very important fact: **EVERY SINGLE GAMING SYSTEM OUT THERE HAS AT LEAST ONE BOTTLENECK AND THIS IS HOW THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE!** Why? Well it's really quite simple actually. One component is always going to be faster than another one. It's either the CPU that has to wait on the GPU to finish rendering or it's the GPU that has to wait on a slow CPU to give it data to render to the screen. In the rare event that there are no bottlenecks (this does not happen in real life!) it would mean that both the CPU and the GPU are at 100% load all of the time!

100% load on a CPU (caused by your game) is something you do not want because if the CPU is 100% busy it won't have any time left to promptly handle user input. In other words, unless you are running a demo that requires no interaction (mouse, keyboard, joystick, network) then 100% CPU load is a very bad thing. 

___________________________________________________________

**Edit:** To make things clear to people: this is a gaming PC subreddit. We're talking about a game taking 100% on all four cores. That is something you do not want. If you're decompressing a large file or transcoding video you want all cores at 100%, _if you are gaming: you don't_.

____________________________________________________________

The reason it does not happen on modern CPUs is that modern CPUs are almost exclusively **NOT** the bottleneck. Unless you're pairing a Core i3 with a 6990 or an X2 with a GTX590 you are not going to run in to serious bottlenecks on a modern system with a modern game like BF3.

In other words, **a game that scales well** over multiple cores (at least 4) will not bottleneck any GPU, dual GPU, triple GPU or quad GPU. All the CPU does in modern games like this is collect user input and network input, determine where the players and the bullets are and who just killed you. 

This data is translated in to how a scene in the game looks at this very instant and transferred to the GPU in the form of rendering instructions. The amount of work the CPU has to do for high resolutions or triple monitors is not significantly higher than the amount of work it needs to do for a single 1920x1080 screen. It mostly amounts to more work for the GPU with bigger screens, not the CPU.

In other words, a modern quad-core processor like the X4 or the i5 is very unlikely to bottleneck one or even multiple graphics cards.

**So what does this mean?**

_______________________________________________________________


The bottom line is simple really. **On a gaming system you want the GPU to be your bottleneck!** An ideal performance scenario for a gaming PC is having the CPU at a maximum of about 80% usage (where lower is better) while having the GPU close to 100%. This allows the CPU all the time in the world to process information from the game server and your keyboard and mouse inputs while the GPU is very busy rendering your sleek looking DirectX11 world. Ideal would be for the GPU to end up between 90% and 100%. This leaves the GPU able to respond to new instructions from the CPU in a timely manner.

Don't be scared off by all the smoke and mirrors regarding bottlenecking. A modern fast quad core is unlikely to bottleneck your videocards in BF3 and newer games. By a modern quad core I mean an i5 2500K or an X4 970. Unless you're running triple 570s, triple 580s, triple 6950s, dual 590s or dual 6990s I find it extremely unlikely that you'll run in to (the wrong) bottlenecks with your CPU. 

_______________________________________________________

**Mind you, this text uses Battlefield 3 Beta as a baseline** because it actually really uses your 4 cores. **Older and more poorly programmed (for multicore) games are quicker on an i5** because they basically use 1 core and maybe schedule some unimportant stuff on another core. For properly programmed modern games like BF3 there is far less of a problem with an X4 because this game is finally using the real potential of a quad core processor. In other words, the i5 is still faster than the X4 but when all cores are used both the i5 and the X4 are 'too fast' for any normal videocard combination.

A small word of caution though. Battlefield 3 is still in the Beta phase and not all of the game's features have been enabled. I've seen destruction turned on and off if I remember correctly so we are bound to see some increase in CPU usage for the release version of the game. If you're designing a new gaming rig it would be wise to wait a little while for the release version. By the time BF3 is released, Bulldozer should also be available. If you're thinking about upgrading your X4 I'd also wait for some more benchmarks.

*If you can't wait, I estimate the X6 or i5 to be a fairly safe bet.*

__________________________________________________________
 TL;DR: start at paragraph 1, line 1, word 1 and read your way to the right and down until you get to this point.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
___________________________________________________________

**Some more clarification is needed, judging by the replies and the questions so please take note of the following! Older games that poorly scale over 4 cores require an i5 or faster to make sure you can feed high-end or multiple high-end graphics cards. Upcoming Bulldozer processors are likely to fit the bill as well, as are the upcoming Sandy Bridge E processors. It makes no sense to me personally to pair a high-end graphics card with a bottom of the barrel CPU but since people seem to be considering that: DON'T. Building a high-end gaming PC means using high-end parts. Skimping on stuff like CPU or buying a cheap 1000W power supply for your setup is not a wise thing to do! This post references Battlefield 3 as a next generation game that scales well over 4 and even 6 cores and makes much better use of an X4 than a lot of other games.**

I'm also still working on the overclock. I'm currently running the 3570K conservatively at 4.5GHz w/ 1.35v and I have both video cards turned up as far as the Catalyst Control Center's overdrive will allow (1125MHz core, 1575MHz memory). I have had it stable at 1.45V and 4.7GHz, but my temps were pushing 90C (&gt;60C above my water temperature) and I even got a boot at 4.8GHz, but that bluescreened after a couple minutes.

**Comments on part choice:**

* Mobo was chosen because it was the only thing with my color scheme that fit all of my needs (thought about the ECS golden, but there wern't enough USB headers and the extreme4's reviews were better)
* PSU was again chosen for colors and the fact that it was available via daily deal
* RAM was chosen because of the overclocking reputation (which held true, I currently have it at 2133, 10-10-10-24 and am certain I can do better)
* SSDs were chosen based on reviews and daily deal showing up at just the right time
* CPU was chosen because the most processor intensive thing I do is game, no video editing or encoding and whatnot"	t5_2sq2y	True

1327442509.0	ov25q	The waiting game....	Markus_Antonius	86	11	44	"Hey /r/gamingpc,

Been wanting to address this for a while now because we regularly get flooded with the same question over and over (and over) again.

* Should I wait for Ivy Bridge?

This is not a valid question. It's like asking ""today is sunny, should I wait for tomorrow because tomorrow might be even sunnier!""

_________________________

There is nothing known yet about the real world performance of Ivy Bridge **because it doesn't exist yet.**

__________________

The only sensible thing to ask yourself is this:

* Do I want a new computer now or do I want a new computer in 3 months?
* Does a new computer with current parts do what I want and does it have room for when I want more?
* Does building a computer now give me what I want for a price I consider to be worth it **NOW?**

Prices of computer components don't drop significantly until they are outdated. Waiting for Ivy Bridge in the hopes that Sandy Bridge will drop in price might sound reasonable but in reality prices of the aging Sandy Bridge will not drop when Ivy Bridge is introduced. 

_______________

If the past 20 years are anything to go by, what normally happens is that something new like Ivy Bridge will be more expensive than an equally performing Sandy Bridge because it is newer. Prices will then start dropping gradually on both the older generation and the newer generation of processors.

_________________

By the time the CPU you want is at a significant low, you'll no longer want it, you'll want the upcoming latest and greatest.

____________________

People have been playing the waiting game throughout the history of computing for as long as I can remember and nobody has ever won this game.

___________________

People that waited for Bulldozer waited a year, only to find out that Bulldozer did not perform as expected. To make matters worse, it had worse performance per dollar than the by then year-old Sandy Bridge!
**After having been on the market for months now, it is still way too expensive to justify buying over a Core i5!!**

_____________________

People with X58 systems have been waiting for Sandy Bridge E for a long time. Now that it has finally hit the market everybody is waiting for..... wait for it..... the next ""stepping"". WTF?!?!

_______________________

People that bought a Phenom II X4 so they could wait for Bulldozer are now waiting for Piledriver.

___________________

People that were waiting for the HD7970 are now waiting for it to drop below the price of a 580. Newsflash: **it never will!**

__________________

**But wait a minute,** I hear you think (pun intended)... the 680 will beat the 7970, right? Why not wait?

________________

Sure thing, wait until the 680. Don't forget to upgrade your mainboard in the meantime because it will be PCIe 3.0. Oh no sorry, you were waiting for the next generation of mainboards, my bad.

____________________

Please, for the love of all you've been waiting for, ask yourselves if you can buy something you want right now for a price you are willing to pay right now! Something better will always be around the corner but if what you have now plays your games at a setting and framerate you want **NOW** there's no bloody use in waiting because by the time you're done waiting on the hardware you'll want to wait for the next big game release.

Hopefully I can gather a little help and start a spreadsheet when the results start coming in. Good luck and happy benchmarking.

I'd like to add that all this is done at your own risk as is any CPU overclock and video card overclock. Any questions can be answered either by me or any of the other more experienced users and make sure you ask those which can achieve the greater performance boosts for advice.

1374150177.0	1ijyzt	I need some troubleshooting help when it comes to using controllers (gamepads) to play games on my PC. (Don't upvote)	winningismylastname	132	59	25	"So my problem is that I recently bought a 360 controller (corded usb) for playing games on my PC. For some reason though whenever I'm using this controller to play games, after about 4 - 5 minutes the frame rate will drop significantly (I'm talking 1-2 fps) unless I move the mouse. This will continue to happen every 4 - 5 minutes and everytime I need to move my mouse to fix it back up. I only have to tap the mouse and just register a movement and the game will then go back to normal.

Anyone know what might be causing this or how I can fix it. If you need information about my PC just ask. Any and all help would be appreciated.

*I hope I've come to the right thread I don't post often.

EDIT: I've gotta go to bed know it's late as it is and I need to get up for work in the morning. Thanks you to everyone for all the help so far, hopefuly this helps in fixing my problems. I'll let you guys know how it goes.

EDIT#2: So I won't be home for another 7.5 hrs, I'll try some of the suggestions you guys have posted then and I'll let you know how they go.

EDIT#3: So I've managed to fix my problem (I think, so far so good). I had to manually remove the old Nvidia software and drivers and delete them from the registry. After that I was able to install the newly downloaded drivers and so far I've had no problems with the controller lag.
Thanks everyone who pointed me in the right direction and gave me help, it was much appreciated."	t5_2sq2y	True

1366338252.0	1cni5g	A brief word on anti aliasing.	Markus_Antonius	87	20	29	"Hi /r/gamingpc :-)

Been a while since I've done a writeup on something but I was just reading some comments on high resolution monitors vs low resolution monitors and Anti Aliasing (AA). The theory of a lot of people is that on a high resolution screen you need less AA in order for your games to look good. While this is theoretically true, here's some math that shows that 27"" 2560x1440 monitors really doesn't have that much more pixels per inch than the the often used 23"" 1920x1080 monitors.

For the example I will use two often seen monitors:

* The Asus V232H (23"", 1920x1080) - all other 23"" 1920x1080 monitors will the same pixel density, unless the 23"" is a lie ;-)

* The Dell U2713HM (27"", 2560x1440) - all other 27"" 2560x1440 monitors, including the popular Korean IPS panels will have the same pixel density unless the 27"" is a lie.

Here are the specs that really matter for needing (wanting) AA:

* The 23"" has a pixel pitch of 0.266mm (translates in to 25.4/0.266  = 95.5 dpi)

* The 27"" has a pixel pitch of 0.230mm (translates in to 25.4/0.230 = 110.4 dpi)

The difference in dpi between the ""high res"" and the ""low res"" monitor is ((110.4/95.5)-1)*100 = 15.6%.

Anti aliasing as you all have probably noticed goes in increments of 2x, 4x, 8x etc. 2xAA basically means that the GPU will render an image that is twice as big on the horizontal axis and twice as big on the vertical (making the image actually 4x bigger, which is why AA is heavy on the GPU). 2xAA thus means a 2x higher pixel density than 0xAA or: twice the dots per inch (theoretical dots per inch because your monitor does not really have them, obviously).

This means that the 23"" monitor with 2xAA will have a theoretical 95.5*2 = 191dpi. If you put that picture next to the 27"" monitor with 0xAA, the 23"" wins in image quality by a HUGE margin (191dpi vs 110.4).

To sum it up, a 27"" catleap is nowhere near as much higher in pixels per inch than a 23"" asus to come even close to warranting turning off the AA. In fact, the monitors are so close in dots per inch that it's not even realistic to run them at different AA settings.

Just something to think about when you buy a 2560x1440 monitor and hope that you can turn off AA. You can obviously turn it off but it won't look better than turning it off on a 23"" 1920x1080 monitor. Not by a lot anyway.

So whenever you think you can save money on something (slower graphics card or one with a narrow memory bus) it's always wise to throw some math at it, it might avoid disappointment.

**Edit 1:** *the purpose of this writeup is not to discourage buying a high res panel, it's to inform people that even on 2560x1440 panels you will still want AA and you will most likely want it at the same levels you would for a 1080p panel.*

**Edit 2:** *There are different forms of anti aliasing, the one I used to get to a 2x pixels per inch is one of the these forms. This was done for simplicity's sake as most others involve an explanation that would probably not fit in the length of a reddit post and would detract from the message the writeup was trying to convey. None of the other forms of AA would invalidate the point the writeup is trying to make though. Even AF (anisotropic filtering) is strictly a form of Anti Aliasing and that one is especially necessary, even on high resolution screens. As for subpixel rendering, AA is not strictly subpixel rendering (as correctly commented on below) but it's closer to subpixel rendering than a blur filter in nature.*

**Edit 3:** /u/NMEMine did an **excellent** writeup on the [various forms of AA and how they work here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/szrwr/anti_aliasing_levels_whats_the_point_of_insanely/c4iotrb), have a read if you're interested!"	t5_2sq2y	True

* There are no ""safe"" overclocks! Overclocking is inherently unsafe. If it weren't, stock clocks would be 5GHz.

* There are no ""safe"" voltages! Overvolting is inherently unsafe and more so than just overclocking.

* If your CPU or GPU does not clock past X GHz it is not broken. CPUs and GPUs are designed only to operate without problems on their stock settings!

* Your CPU or GPU is not guaranteed to work on overclocks and not guaranteed to survive an overclock. If it fails (temporarily or permanently) you cannot blame the manufacturer for this.

The warnings about breaking stuff when overclocking or overvolting are there for a reason! It is because they are true!

The simple fact that bad things don't happen often does not mean they don't happen ever!

Overclocking a CPU or a GPU can cause system-wide instability that manifests itself in various ways. If your system suffers mysterious crashes, freezes, performance degradations, driver crashes, blue screens, artifacts or other problems the number one most likely cause is your overclock. Not your PSU, not your memory, not your mainboard, not your CPU, not your GPU but... **your overclock!**

In the past, to combat this, we have always added more rules to try to reset the focus back onto the path and it has always been fairly successful. However, as our subreddit is becoming larger (we will shortly cross the 10,000 mark), this strategy is becoming less effective.

Lately we've been having to remove a lot of posts. It is necessarily to keep posts and discussion on topic and respectful. However we do realize that all the rules can seem a bit daunting at times, and there's a lot of confusion on what actually is allowed. So I'm here to hopefully clear some things up.

A lot of people seem to think we are simply a high-end version of /r/buildapc. While we do offer build help and give troubleshooting advice for high-end builds, that is not what this subreddit is about. We only allow these posts out of necessity, because they often have no other place to go.

Our real focus is gaming hardware discussion.

We get a lot of posts linking articles on new and upcoming hardware and that's great. We love to read them and the discussion that goes on in the comments is great. 

Another thing I'd like to encourage is user generated content. Things like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/ug9yd/videocard_benchmarking_comparisons/) and all the other links in our Resources &amp; Guides section in the sidebar. We love it when users take the time to add to the community. Reviews of products, guides, and collaborative projects are amazing.

We don't just like talking about them either, we would love to see what you have under the hood. Just make sure to keep the pictures on topic.

We also allow posts asking specific questions regarding high end hardware. However we would be appreciative if you provide the appropriate information regarding the question in the original post, and provide any extra information if it is asked of you. Also regarding questions: please do as much research yourself as possible. We'd prefer not to answer questions that could be solved with a quick Google search, and your post may be removed. Remember, this sub is intended for experienced builders. We respect that you want to learn, but please direct ""what is a CPU"" type questions to /r/buildapc or other appropriate subreddits.

We will be pushing the focus back to hardware discussion in the weeks to come.

This is by no means an exhaustive list of allowed content. But anything else along these lines will most likely be acceptable. If you ever have questions on whether something is acceptable or not, feel free to message the mods. Just keep in mind that the answer could be no, but it's nothing personal. The rules are also a good way to tell if something is acceptable to post or not. Use common sense; just because the rules don't specifically mention something doesn't mean it's always okay to post it.

__________________________________________


Hey builders! I was just reading some build questions over on /r/buildapc and I was once again startled by the number of questions related to CPU idle temperatures, load temperatures, heatsinks and thermal paste. To hopefully alleviate some of the confusion, I've put together a short FAQ .

_________________________________________________

* Please realize that each individual CPU of the same model is unique in the amount of heat it produces. This means that one Core i5 2500K will put out a different amount of heat than another seemingly identical 2500K. This is normal and doesn't mean there is anything wrong. Occasionally, reseating the heatsink may drop temperatures slightly but most of the time the heatsink is not the problem.

* Higher voltages result in higher temperatures and higher clocks also result in higher temperatures. Upping them both obviously results in... higher temperatures. To keep the lifespan of your CPU as long as possible you have to at least try to keep the voltage as low as possible. Below 1.38V is generally considered to be 'safe' (talking Sandy Bridge here) but the reality is that with any overclocking / out of spec running of your CPU it may fail and your warranty will not cover this damage.

* The CPU can request it's preferred voltage from your mainboard voltage regulation circuit. In fact, every single Core i5 has it's own unique optimal voltage setting that is entered into the chip at the factory. This is one of the reasons that your i5 2500K might run hotter or cooler than your neighbors i5 2500K. This is not a problem and does not indicate you or your neighbor did anything wrong! Producing microprocessors is done in such a way that no two same-spec processors are identical. This is a result of the nanoscale manufacturing process. The components are simply too small to get a perfect chip so each and every single processor has minor defects. These defects don't affect operation but they do affect things like needed voltage and temperature gradients. Don't believe me? [**Here's what Intel says about this!**]( http://www.intel.com/content/dam/doc/datasheet/2nd-gen-core-desktop-vol-1-datasheet.pdf) Page 70, paragraph 7.4 - Vcc Voltage Identification (VID)

* A heatsink does not cool your CPU, a heatsink spreads the heat your CPU emits out over a large surface area as quickly as possible. Because a heatsink does not cool it will only ever get your temps closer to the ambient temperature within the computer case. It cannot physically go any lower. This is simple thermodynamics. The lower the temperature in the case, the bigger the difference between the CPU surface temperature and the surrounding temperature will be. This difference is called the **temperature delta**. The higher this delta value the more effective your heatsink will be. Higher temperatures inside the cases make for poorer heatsink performance and it doesn't matter one damn bit how expensive your CPU cooler is.

* Thermal paste is there to fill up microscopic scratches on the surface of your CPU as well as on the surface of the heatsink. Without the thermal paste these scratches would be filled with air and air is a heat *insulator*. Thermal paste conducts heat better than air. This layer of paste is meant to be as thin as possible while being thick enough to fill these scratches. Because heatsinks and processor casings are precision-manufactured this layer need not be thicker than the diameter of a human hair, slightly less would be preferable. Because this layer is so thin there is no noticeable difference between one brand or another of thermal interface material. Unless you apply the paste like you're pooring a concrete foundation (meaning several feet thick) you are not going to measure a difference. Differences that are reported are the result of reseating the heatsink and not the result of your more expensive goo.

* Update 1: [Interesting video that shows how thermal paste spreads under your heatsink!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyXLu1Ms-q4)

AMA	NewAgePhantom	76	23	80	"So I got this dead 8800GT from my cousin who has zero troubleshooting ability whatsoever. He just replaced it with a 7770. And my GTX 580 Matrix killed itself for the second time and was RMA'd yesterday. Going back to a GT520 and only two screens is not fun, so I decided to try and fix the 8800GT. I mean, there was nothing to lose.

The card was being recognized in windows, however I got the following message: ""Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)"". Which means the card is dead and windows is a dick. Anyway, first thought was what they will they say in the gamingpc IRC? Psikeiro started a stream of recommendations all along the lines of ""Bake it in the oven"". So being advice from psikeiro, the obvious reaction is ""he's trolling"". But I googled it, and every result seemed somewhat insane, but they all put their graphics cards in the oven @ 200C for 10 minutes and seemingly all of them were successful with the 8800GT.

So, off came the heatsink on the card. Cleaned the copper plate and GPU with Isopropyl Alcohol. Preheated the oven to 200C. Stuck the card face down and level over a baking tray lined with aluminium foil (which sounded like a terrible idea but I guessed the foil would reflect the heat pretty well and seeming as the card had no current there would not be much chance of short circuiting seeming as the PCB was off of the foil.). Popped that in the oven for ~10 minutes. Took it out, cooled it for 30 min naturally on the bench.

I re-applied TIM (I used Cooler Master TIM as it was all I have around), I re-fitted the cooler. Put the card back in to the PCIe slot and then the moment of truth. It booted. I had three screens again. It was amazing. I cried.

The initial idle temperature of the GPU was 53C which was a bit off putting, but certain TIMs require time after application to ""cure"" and work correctly. So now, after an hour and a half of functioning perfectly the idle temp is down to 43C. Hopefully it will drop to the mid to high 30s by the end of two days curing.

**TL;DR: I removed the heatsink of my dead 8800GT, cleaned the GPU and PCB. Baked it in the oven @ 200C for 10min, reapplied TIM and the cooler and re-seated the card. Booted my rig and voila, a once dead 8800GT has rised again. I have never been so amazed.**

1344709249.0	y21t3	My new $2000 gaming PC! Pics inside.	TeamZebra	73	15	103	"Hey guys. So I've made a few different threads in the last month or two asking for advice and after many hours of trying to put together a rig, I finally got it ordered and built! This is my first ever home-built PC, and the first non-laptop I've owned since I was 14. Needless to say, I'm a PC gaming convert now.

First off, let me preface by saying that I'm extremely happy with the parts I've picked out and don't care to hear any nay-saying on any of my part choices, specifically the GPU. I had the money to burn and made my choices.

Now, here's the parts list. After shipping and things like that, it came out to about $2000 when I ordered it 2 weeks ago.

[Here are the pictures of the build itself.](http://imgur.com/a/jF7s1) 

Sorry for the quality of the pictures. I don't own a decent camera, so I took them with my iPhone. It was hard to make it focus well on the CPU heatsink and not make the rest of the picture dark as as hell. I know the cable management isn't the greatest, but I don't have too many components in there and it's my first build, so I tried as best I knew how.

[Here are some benchmark-related pictures.](http://imgur.com/a/iFUv5)

Sorry for the hi-res screenshots. Basically, I got pretty good scores in Unigine Heaven, I feel. I haven't overclocked the GPU yet, but I plan on it soon. I'm running the CPU at a pretty stable 4.7GHz right now, I've done Prime95 stress tests and Intel XTU stressing, and my temps never really seem to get into the 80s, so I'm pretty pleased with the CPU cooler.

As far as gaming goes, this video card has been absolutely destroying everything I've thrown at it so far. I've even put The Witcher 2 on Ubersampling mode with everything else cranked all the way up, and it's still perfectly playable. I was pretty dumbstruck when I witnessed that.

Anyway, that's my computer. Thought you guys might appreciate it, you've been more than helpful in my learning how to build a computer.

EDIT: Started messing with overclocking the GPU. I haven't been able to get it to run at 1200MHz stably, but I can run it at 1195MHz core clock and +300MHz memory clock before I start running into issues.

[Here's a new benchmark with the GPU overclocked.](http://imgur.com/0ODRn) I'm a little disappointed with the overclocking ability on this card, seeing as I can't hit 1200MHz reliably, but it's the luck of the draw and even the stock settings destroy every game I've played, I just like pretty numbers in benchmarks :)



EDIT 2: [Here is about where I started capping out before I started seeing artifacts.](http://imgur.com/dgUnR) I'm at +90MHz core clock and +450MHz memory clock (1195MHz core clock, 3454MHz memory clock). Definitely better than before, but not as high as a lot of others I've seen. Ah well :P"	t5_2sq2y	True

1329756988.0	pxy9y	Sandy Bridge E recommendations - the why!	Markus_Antonius	67	11	40	"**Why it's a good idea to use Sandy Bridge E as a high-end gaming platform**

There still seems to be a lot of confusion about exactly what Ivy Bridge will bring to the table and what it won't bring. Also, there's still a lot of confusion about PCI Express 3.0 and Gen3 mainboards. I'll try to clear it up once more.

* Sandy Bridge on socket 1155 is CPU (and socket/mainboard) limited to 16 lanes PCI Express total. These are hardwired connections from the CPU, through the socket, to the slots. 16 hardwired connections total. You cannot go beyond 16 lanes total by swapping out your CPU for an Ivy Bridge. Some mainboards employ certain switch chips (like NF200) that emulate 32 lanes but the lanes running to and from the CPU (and through the CPU the main memory) are limited to 16 lanes! Dual graphics cards are hardwired limited to x8/x8 and in the event of a switch chip they will perform somewhere in between a x8/x8 2.0 and x16/x16 2.0 connection. More than 2 graphics cards will mean a sub-optimal configuration. 

* Ivy Bridge on socket 1155 will be limited to 16 lanes total of PCI Express 3.0. For single graphics card setups this means a PCIe 3.0 x16 connection, for dual graphics cards this means PCI 3.0 x8/x8. For more than 2 graphics cards this means a sub-optimal configuration. Ivy Bridge on socket 1155 will only be able to use PCI Express 3.0 transfer speeds on Gen3 mainboards.

* The recommended transfer speed per card for multiple high-end graphics cards is 8GB/s per card. For dual graphics cards this cannot be achieved on Sandy Bridge socket 1155 but it can be achieved on Ivy Bridge socket 1155 with a Gen3 mainboard. For more than 2 graphics cards this speed cannot be achieved with Sandy Bridge socket 1155 and also cannot be achieved with Ivy Bridge socket 1155. 8GB/s for dual cards can be achieved with PCIe 2.0 x16/x16 or PCIe 3.0 x8/x8.

If you build on a Sandy Bridge E platform you can:

* Run 2 high-end graphics cards at PCIe 2.0 x16/x16 (if the cards are PCIe 2.0)

* Run 2 high-end graphics cards at PCIe 3.0 x16/x16 (if the cards are PCIe 3.0)

* Run 3 high-end cards at at PCIe 3.0 (or 2.0) x16/x8/x8

* Run 4 high-end cards at PCIe 3.0 (or 2.0) x8/x8/x8/x8

**None of the above can be achieved with any socket 1155 system!!** High end cards like the HD 7970 and HD 7950 are known to bottleneck slightly in some games and noticeably in other games. No game that exists yet uses these cards at their full potential but given the fact that these are 3GB cards they will be able to run future games with extremely detailed textures and meshes. More detail means more data. More data means more intensive use of the PCI Express connection between the main memory / CPU memory controller and the videocard(s).

When building for 2 high-end cards it is a good idea to build on Sandy Bridge E. Not only is the difference already noticeable in today's games but it's likely to be more noticeable in future games. Unless you are building for last year's games only, my recommendation is to use Sandy Bridge E in the following situations:

* Dual/Triple/Quad HD 7970 

* Dual/Triple/Quad HD 7950

* Dual/Triple/Quad Next-Gen NVidia

And even dual/triple HD6950/6970 GTX 570/580.

This recommendation is not because you need it. **This recommendation is because you can! You don't need dual 7970 either. You get it because you want to and because you can. Why would you want to build a high-end system that is already showing signs of aging because the PCI Express speed is starting to get noticeable??**

Lower cards in my recommendation would do just fine in a socket 1155 system, as will single graphics setups.  It just makes no sense to me to go out and buy $1200 of graphics cards and try to skimp $100 on a CPU. The i7 3820 is only about $100 more expensive than an i5 2500K. 

**This makes just about as much sense as spending $300,000 on a Ferrari and trying to save money by putting in a cassette player instead of a CD player (your reasoning being: ""the CD player won't make the car go faster"").**

Socket 2011 will stay relevant longer than socket 1155. Not because I know what will happen in the future but for the simple reason that it has ample power in every corner and socket 1155 does not.

As for the other benefits of Sandy Bridge E:

* 10MB CPU cache

* Lower latency PCI express (do not confuse this with bandwidth and transfer speeds)

* Quad channel memory

* Possibility of choosing a 6 core

* Overclocking via the base clock instead of just the multiplier

Socket 1155 was never intended to be an enthusiast platform. It only became an enthusiast platform for lack of better options. Socket 2011 was not only intended as an enthusiast platform, it offers everything an enthusiast could possibly want and is a worthy replacement for X58.

**Will you see benefits over Ivy Bridge PCIe 3.0 x8/x8 NOW? &gt;&gt;&gt;NO!&lt;&lt;&lt;**

**Things to consider though:**

* SB-E will allow every single conceivable card setup at the maximum speeds currently available.
* SB-E is a newer architecture than Sandy Bridge and lessons learned by Intel are undoubtedly included in this architecture.
* More PCI express bandwidth is likely to matter sooner than more CPU power. SB-E already has more CPU power than any game needs and it has the reserve bandwidth for future upgrades as well!
* Ivy Bridge is not even here yet but even if it were and it were faster, there is no headroom in the PCI express department. SB-E has headroom in both!

Lots of people get a 1000W power supply for ""future SLI"" (no immediate benefits!) but nobody gets a superior architecture over socket 1155?

***Final thought: there's been a lot of back and forth in the comments over spending extra ""being worth it"". If something is worth ""it"" is a very personal thing. For me it's worth spending extra because I don't like ugly surprises when I find out later that spending some $200 extra would have been a good idea. For me it's worth it knowing that I did not compromise on anything.***

***To me building a high-end gaming system means going high-end all the way. Sometimes this will not pay off big time but one thing is certain: you won't have lower performance if you spend a little more. The worst that can happen is (almost) equal or better performance.***

***For a lot of young people, spending money only makes sense if they see immediate improvement. That's probably the main reason we see dual high-end graphics cards running on cheap 1000W power supplies.***

***I'm not saying: ""you can't"" or ""you shouldn't"" -- I'm saying: ""I wouldn't"".***

Most of the talk is about what is the best fan configuration, and everybody seems to have their own opinion without knowing any of the science behind it.  Central to this is the debate between ""negative pressure"" (more air exhaust than intake) and ""positive pressure"" (more air intake than exhaust) systems, and which configuration provides the best cooling for your PC and its individual components.  Despite the huge number of discussions, there does not seem to be any agreement on which is the best.  I believe this is mostly due to people not quite understanding the science and reasoning behind it all.  Well lucky for you, I am a trained physicist, and I'm going to attempt to straighten it all out in this post.

______________
**A Brief Overview of the Physics of Airflow (for dummies)**

Airflow, or more specifically fluid flow, is governed by the laws of [fluid dynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics), which are simply just restatements of physical principles such as conservation of energy and Newton's laws, applied to fluids.  Air, as you should know, is a fluid, and its movement is therefore governed by the laws of fluid dynamics.  Central to fluid dynamics is [Bernoulli's principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_equation), which simply states that if the pressure (or potential energy) of a fluid decreases, its speed increases, and vice versa (which is simply a restatement of conservation of energy and Newton's second law, the more universal physical laws).  This gives rise to the fact that *air moves from high pressure to low pressure*.  The physics behind all of this is quite fundamental, and worth researching if you are interested, but what is important to know right now is that *air moves from higher to lower pressures*.  Got it?  Good.  Moving on...

______________
**Positive and Negative Pressures - What Are They?**

Basically, a positive pressure system means that you have more air coming into your case than being exhausted out of your case.  If your fans all have the same CFM rating, then you will have a ""positive pressure"" system if you have more intake fans than exhaust fans.  You will have a ""negative pressure"" system if more of those fans are exhaust than intake.  

The theory behind this is that having more fans (or more powerful fans) blowing air in creates a positive [pressure gradient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_gradient) between the inside of the case and its surroundings.  Since there is more air inside the case than outside, the density of particles is greater inside, and therefore the pressure is greater inside.  By the Bernoulli principle and simple physics, the fresh air will tend to push pockets of older air out of the case (through random holes and crevices like the 5.25"" bays and the expansion slots) as they move towards the lower pressure outside.  [This video demonstrates ""positive pressure"" airflow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe-2ZqmSGug), but please take it with a grain of salt, since the pressure gradient is most likely tiny (and ignore the YouTube comments).

Conversely, a negative pressure system does just the opposite as a positive pressure system.  More exhaust fans will create a vacuum like effect in your case.  The air inside will be sucked out, and therefore the air inside will be less dense than outside.  Consequently, since air will want to move towards the lower pressure system, outside air will seep through any nooks and crannies.

[This page has a few good diagrams that will help demonstrate the different setups](http://www.silverstonetek.com/techtalk_cont.php?tid=wh_positive&amp;area=usa).
 
______________
**What Configuration is Better?**

Well, *in theory*, a positive pressure scenario SHOULD (and the keyword here is SHOULD) work better, due to the following reasoning: in this setup, your system should pull cool air inwards through the intake fans and exhaust air out through the exhaust fans and the nooks and crannies in your case (extra vents, expansion slots, etc.).  If you have dust filters on your intake fans, your system should remain virtually dust free, since this scenario only allows air to be brought in through the fan emplacements.  Without dust filters however, you will be blowing all sorts of dust onto your components.  This method will establish a wind tunnel-like effect.

I drew out a [positive pressure flow diagram](http://i.imgur.com/7qxge.jpg) to further demonstrate what is going on.  This setup assumes there is a side panel fan and there are two top fans, in addition to the ones pictured.  The red arrows represent fast, hot air. The blue arrows represent fast, cool air. The pink arrows represent slow, hot air. Finally, the white arrows represent slow, system temperature air.  In the pictured setup, the top left fan is exhaust while the top right fan is intake.  You can see that this creates a convection cell which possibly recirculates warm air into the case.  This can be fixed by removing the left fan, moving the fans further apart, or flipping the direction of the left fan.  In reality, this circulation is probably negligible, and shouldn't affect temperatures negatively.  Depending on the strength of the fans, this configuration may even be beneficial, but circulation cells should be avoided if possible.

As far as negative pressure systems go, you are basically creating a vacuum cleaner.  In the negative pressure [setup pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/k1Y7Z.jpg), assume the top right fan is non-existent, and replaced by a vent or grill.  The positive aspect of this setup is that the system will more quickly cycle out hot air.  The downside is that all the air seeping in through the nooks and crannies will not be dust filtered, and your system is more likely to build up dust.  You will also notice that there is a circulation cell near the graphics cards, which is hard to avoid with this setup.

______________
**Doesn't Heat Rise?**

In a static system, yes.  However, if you have multiple fans directing the direction of airflow, as you do in a PC, then the heat will go in whichever direction you push it.  Therefore, top fans do not always have to be exhaust, and can even be detrimental to airflow in some cases.  Imagine that there is an intake fan in the 5.25"" drive bays in the above picture, and both top fans were exhaust.  In this case, the top right fan would actually suck out the cool air brought in from the fan in the 5.25"" bays, depriving the CPU cooler of fresh, cool air.

Additionally, warm air is easier to move than cool air.  This is because warm air is less dense than cool air, for some fixed volume.  As air heats up, the air particles vibrate and move faster and spread out (the air expands; basic thermodynamics at work here).  For some fixed, permeable volume, there will be less particles present if the air is hot rather than cool.  The resulting air is ""thinner"", and less dense, and therefore requires less energy to move.  Imagine having a cup of water and cup of sludge (and pretend that it isn't sticky).  If you tilt them at an angle, the water will fall out of the cup quite quickly while the syrup will crawl along.  This is because the syrup is more dense!  In the case of a PC, the syrup is the cold air, while the water is the warm air!

______________
**The Cold Hard Reality**

Realistically, the positive pressure and negative pressure systems will be very similar.  This is because most cases are chock full of holes and establishing a large enough pressure gradient in the entire case is difficult without extremely powerful fans.  The local pressure gradients however, will be decently large near each fan.  Because of this, you should configure your system based off how powerful your fans are and also the layout of your case.  For example, if you have a fan that will allow you to avoid recirculation near your graphics cards if it acts as an intake, use it as one.  If you can create a strong flow over your CPU using an exhaust fan, do that.  The most important thing is that your system is constantly supplied with cool, fresh, dust free air.  Whatever configuration will accomplish this for you is what you should use.  In my case, a positive pressure system is the most beneficial.  It will most likely be this way for all systems.

The best bet is to draw out your airflow diagram and see what will provide the most wind-tunnel like effect while minimizing dust intake.  Remember your basic fluid dynamics to determine the direction of the airflow.  Of course, fan dust filters help in this aspect.  Also note that filters only need to be placed on intake fans.  You can make a cheap filter by using women's pantyhose/tights and wrapping them around your fans (stay tuned for this!).

Hopefully this helps when configuring the airflow of your system!

Cheers!

Just finished up the initial build of my next system. In January I'll be ordering all of the water cooling gear (over $2,000 worth of kit) and planning the aesthetics. I'm going for a white, red and gold build. I'll probably be painting the radiators red and using gold fittings with white coolant. The fans will have white frames, red blades and gold accent rings. I have a lot planned for this build. I haven't even really begun.

BTW, initial stability testing looks good and I'm able to hit 4.7-4.8 GHz stable at 1.375V; I think that will be my 24/7 overclock. Any tips you guys have for planning the loop -- I'm all ears. I also need to place an order with Nils because the Corsair braided cables really bother me.

**About**

I play games... lol. Right now I'm playing on 3 monitors at 5760x1080 and it can max out pretty much everything. I was originally going to get the evga classified 680's but with the lower memory bit rate they suck on high resolutions... this is my first time back to the AMD/ATI club since my 1950xtx (old). i must say I'm surprised how awesome these cards are. Before i bought the 7970's i had 2 580 1.5gb cards and they did not run 3 monitor games very well at all. I do a decent amount of benching which is why my components are probably a lot higher end then they need to be. The cpu was chosen because i do a lot of cad design and it really does improve my rendering downtime. 

If you have any questions about the build or for me or want another picture of something I'm willing to help out!

this is my first post in this sub reddit so go easy haha

Thanks!

By request of many: Basic PC architecture - Part 1 :-)	Markus_Antonius	58	3	18	"Okay, a little while ago I asked for input on what guides to write next and thank all of you for a lot of reactions! Most asked for were graphics cards, motherboards, SSDs and a basic overview. I will address all of these (and more) but to be able to understand why one component may be better than another we'll need to do the overview first.

Basic components
-----------------

I think most of us know what the basic components inside the computer are but I'll list them first and then go into detail on each of them in the posts that follow:

* The processor or CPU

* The mainboard with all it's components / chips.

* The memory

* The harddisk and/or SSD

* The graphics card, sometimes incorrectly referred to as the GPU

* The power supply or PSU

And ofcourse when we're done with what's inside the PC we'll move on to the peripherals:

* The monitor

* The keyboard

* The mouse

The CPU, mainboard and memory are closely tied together so for this first few parts we'll be all over these three. Your choice of CPU architecture determines what type of mainboard you'll need and mainboard architectures between the two are different.

The mainboard (AMD)
----------------------

For AMD mainboards we'll mostly be talking about the latest generation of socket AM3+ mainboards. Most of the design however is identical to older AMD mainboards. Please bear in mind that the only *real* AM3+ boards are the ones with an AMD 9xx based chipset. When we talk about the various features of AMD boards here we are referring to 9xx based boards. If you have an older chipset you may not have all of these features.

AMD based mainboards have 2 chips that comprise the mainboard *chipset*: the *northbridge* chip and the *southbridge* chip.

**The Northbridge**

The northbridge on AMD mainboards is mainly home to the PCI express controller. This chip therefore determines how many total PCI express lanes can be used on a particular mainboard. This is why 990FX boards can do x16/x16 dual graphics and 990X and 970 boards can only do x8/x8 or single x16 graphics. The northbridge also houses the IOMMU unit which is a type of memory controller that allows other chips direct access to the computer's main memory in a flexible manner.

**The Southbridge**

The southbridge on AMD mainboards houses the AMD SATA controller, AMD USB2 controller, the controller for the legacy PCI bus and hosts and several single lane PCI express connections.

It also *connects to* the onboard audio chip on the mainboard and the onboard network controller(s) on the mainboard as well as the legacy I/O controller chip which houses things like the old parellel printer port, serial port and PS/2 mouse/keyboard connectors. The way these items are wired up to the southbridge is either via an internal PCI bus connection or an internal PCI express bus connection. To the operating systems these devices appear the same way as when they would be on an expansion card in a PCI or PCI express slot.

To get some idea of the various components on a modern AM3+ mainboard, here is a diagram of the Gigabyte 990FXA-UD3 mainboard: [AMD Mainboard Diagram](http://i.imgur.com/QQsja.png)

As you can see, this mainboard also hosts 2 USB3 controller chips, a Firewire (or 1394) controller chip and an extra SATA controller chip that provides additional SATA ports to the ones that already run directly from the SB850 southbridge chip on this board. These additions can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and mainboard model to mainboard model and are one of the major points in which mainboards can distinguish themselves from other mainboards.

In AMD architecture the CPU houses the memory controller and so the CPU connects directly to the DIMM slots from it's socket. The CPU also connects directly to the northbridge chip but communicates with the southbridge chip and any devices wired to it via the northbridge chip. For reference, here is a schematic overview of how it all ties together: [990FX Architectural Diagram](http://i.imgur.com/7jZkJ.png)

In AMD architecture the connection between the CPU and the northbridge is what is called a HyperTransport link. This name is not unique to this connection, in multiprocessor (multiprocessor, not multicore!) AMD systems the links between the processors is also a HyperTransport link.

The communication link between the northbridge and southbridge chips is called Alink Express (version 3 in the case of the 9 series chipsets). This name is unique to that specific connection.

The mainboard (Intel)
----------------------

As was the case with the AMD mainboard section we will only be talking about the latest generation of Intel socket 1155 mainboards here (Z68 based). Also, like with the AMD section most of what we discuss here will work the same way for older Intel 1155 mainboards although you may not have all the features that come specifically with the Z68 chipset. Also bear in mind that the Intel 1366 enthusiast platform has a very different architecture and 1366 has more resemblance to the AMD AM3+ platform than it does to the 1155 platform.

One of the things you'll immediately notice when looking at the Intel mainboard diagram is the absence of a northbridge chip: [Intel Mainboard Diagram](http://i.imgur.com/Kj5pd.png)

Sandy Bridge socket 1155 systems don't have a northbridge chip and instead the PCI express connections that are used for the graphics card(s) run directly from the CPU to the slots. The southbridge chip connects directly to the CPU and houses the same basic functionality as the southbridge chip in AMD based systems.

Here's an overview of the Z68 based architecture: [Z68 Architectural Diagram](http://i.imgur.com/UgzfW.png)

On the 1155 platform the link between the CPU and the northbridge (Z68) chip is called a DMI link. This same link is used on the X58 platform for communication between the northbridge and southbridge chips.

In general
----------

For both AM3+ and 1155 processors the memory controller resides on the CPU. The CPU therefore determines whether dual channel, triple channel or quad channel memory is supported. Obviously the communication lines from the CPU to the memory need to be on the mainboard as well. This is one of the reasons that socket 1366 with triple channel memory had more pins (1366 pins!) than Sandy Bridge (1155 pins!) which only supports dual channel. **There are no triple channel socket 1155 boards!**


Ok, that's it for part 1. The next part in this series will follow in a few days. As usual, comments or questions are welcome!

Comes with everthing you could ever need to customize your GPU (including paint) and a OutBoard VRM just incase you need to give the card a little extra Voltage whilst overclocking...

Also includes extra heatsinks for your cooling needs but **beware**, this card needs two eight pin connectors and when fully loaded with all the heatsinks will take up considerable space in your case...

Never seen these cards in Europe before so once released you may have to source the card in Korea or China.....

1331863789.0	qyro2	Leaked specs - a word of warning.	Markus_Antonius	63	13	59	"&gt;With all the leaked specs surfacing as of late I've done some digging and calculating to see if what is leaked is possibly accurate and to estimate to what extent it might be nonsense fueled by wishful thinking. As we've taken a stand on rumor-mongering as of late I thought I'd share the findings with you on the up and coming Kepler cards.

&gt;Number of streamprocessors / shaders / CUDA cores
--------------------------------------------------

&gt;The new Kepler cards are being made on the TSMC 28nm process. This is the same process the AMD HD7970 is manufactured with. The previous generation of cards was manufactured on 40nm. In effect, this means that every transistor on the GPU chip will be about 33% smaller, making it possible to fit about 40% more transistors on the same die size chip. AMD managed to fit roughly 33% more shaders on the HD7970 compared to the HD6970 (2048 vs 1536). The missing 7% here can possibly be accounted for by the fact that there was also an architecture change on those shaders themselves and the GPU chip as a whole.

&gt;Assuming NVidia has kept their basic architectural structure used in the current Fermi GPUs it would thus be possible to incorporate about 40% more shaders than on the GF110 (GTX 580). This would bring the core count from 512 to roughly 720. **This is a far cry from 1536!** With some optimizations in the architecture I would expect the flagship card to have 768 shaders or possibly even 1024 **but not 1536**.

&gt;Memory bandwidth
------------------

&gt;The leaked specs are talking about a 256-bit memory bus running at a 6GHz effective datarate. This would bring the memory bandwidth of the GTX 680 to 192GB/s which would be slightly lower than the current GTX 580. This in contrast to the HD7970 which sports a memory bandwidth of 264GB/s. **Not bloody likely to be correct on the leaked specs!**

&gt;TDP (heat output) and power usage
----------------------------------

&gt;A proposed heat output of 195W on the GTX 680 is possible but dual 6-pin connectors would bring the maximum board power to 225W. The power usage is bound to be a little higher than the TDP but this still seems a little unlikely. For a heat output of 195W I would expect the power connectors to be a 6-pin and 8-pin configuration. 6+6 can carry 225W of power to the card, 6+8 could do a theoretical maximum of 300W. Usually cards are more amply within tolerances than 225W of power on a 195W TDP card.

&gt;Multimonitor support
--------------------

&gt;Supporting more than 2 monitors out of the box with a single card is among the easiest changes to make. I fully expect a single Kepler card to be able to run 5 monitors. Like with the 7970 though, for performance reasons you might still want a dual card setup.

&gt;Pricing
------

&gt;I predicted the retail price of the 7970 to within $5 before launch. If leaked benchmarks are correct, a calculation would put the GTX 680 at an MSRP of ***just over $600*** ($615-625).

&gt;This is by no means an accurate prediction of things to come. NVidia may have altered their architecture significantly after Fermi, leading to smaller (less transistors) CUDA cores so until we know what the new tech looks like it's hard to predict. Things like the memory bandwidth however remain extremely hard to argue with because it's simple math, no more and no less. I'd expect to see that bandwidth on a GTX 660 Ti but not on a GTX 680.

&gt;**Disclaimer: this is just a quick summation based on rumors versus experience and in no way to be regarded as fact.**

-------------------------------------------

**EDIT**

According to credible leaked information on a Chinese website that just surfaced, it does seem like NVidia has done away with the previous shader core design in favor of more and smaller cores. This actually puts the design somewhere midway between a 7970 and GTX 580. If the SMX architecture is accurate that may well account for 1536 cores in a total of 8 SMP clusters. Lower products can then be manufactured by disabling 1 or more of these clusters, leading to possibly 1366-core, 1152-core, 960-core and so on down the line.

**Be aware that this means you cannot directly compare shader count between the 5 series and 6 series GPUs the same way you can't compare shader count between NVidia and AMD!**

1372350659.0	1h6qg6	Buying a 780 soon... worth upgrading CPU too?	jaguarphd	62	14	97	"Hey guys -

So I've been dead set on buying a 780 ever since I bought my 480. My plan in PC building has always been to buy the top end card, put a second one in after a year and a half, and upgrade 3 generations later. It's my 3 year plan for sustainability, and it's been great so far.

The question is, now that I'm planning on upgrading from my 2x480 to a 780 in the next few months, how badly am I going to be bottlenecked by my CPU? I haven't heard much great stuff about Haswell, but if it's time to upgrade that's a bit more of a financial burden to plan for, seeing as how I'd need to get a new motherboard and potentially memory too. I currently have an Asus P6X58D Premium with an i7-930 and 6x2gb sticks of DDR3-1600.

So if I threw a 780 in this system, would the upgrade from SLI 480s be not as noticeable given the CPU bottleneck? Or would I be okay holding off another 6 months or so for the CPU/Mobo upgrades come the holidays? "	t5_2sq2y	True

But lets get some discussion going and take a look back at 2012 and all that happened during it. With a lot of new users lately this can be a chance to fill them in on the awesomeness that happens in this subreddit.

So, to anyone and everyone, what was your favorite highlight of 2012, what topics did you enjoy and what topics could you simply not stand?

During 2012 we've seen a lot of spectacular builds and especially the honorable *Build of the Month* builds. Some but not all were:

* [Project Aphrodite by Pedantic_Flops (May 2012 Rig of the Month!)](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/uv5c8/project_aphrodite_build_log_part_iii_the_final/c4ytvvm)

* [Caselabs Watercooled by Scudzey (July 2012 Rig of the Month!)](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/wl0nd/after_months_of_work_my_build_is_complete/)

We've seen the fluctuating war of yet another generation of AMD and Nvidia cards. Including some very heated debates over the 6xx series' choice of bit-bus and Nvidias crazy pricing schemes among other things. 

We've seen a massive increase in 2011 socket builds with the availability and pricing becoming a very easy pill to swallow and everyone getting their hands on a 3820 for their sweet sweet SLI/Crossfire builds.

We've seen water cooling galore and some very awesome case [building](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/12jt0b/water_cooled_wallmounted_computer_it_took_months/)**/**[modifications](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/wl0nd/after_months_of_work_my_build_is_complete/), even including some [3D Printer work](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/14yb8k/was_asked_to_post_my_caselabs_m8_casemod_with_3d/).

We started our own overclock benchmarking threads for this small community and got some very nice results so far (more people should join in on this! Links in the sidebar).

We've also encountered quite a few dramas resulting in some very crazy egos being unleashed and they never cease to entertain. So many that even I have lost track of most, if you remember one of these crazy flame wars and you think it's amusing be sure to link it in the comments ;)

Lastly the sub had some moderator changes but, regardless, I know i'd like to thank the past and present moderators for all their hard work in running this subreddit, the IRC channel, TS3 channel and Battlefield 3 server. Even if they can be literally hitler sometimes.

So people, what were your most memorable moments and favorite builds in here?

It seems ironic that as a community hell bent on milking a system for every drop of performance we face it with such adversity despite the many reviews coming out reporting increased performance. 


However, I have met a few DJs, producers, and power users who swear by the consumer preview. Upon my own examination I found my evaluation a contradiction of theirs. Do you think MS will have to approach Windows 8 similarly to the Vista/7 scenario? Will we be forced by developers into an awkward GUI that shuns the the contemporary performance enthusiast? Or maybe we'll all migrate to Linux distros as Valve is prepping for. What are your thoughts on MS's next release?

However, I'm SUPER paranoid about the weather now. Anytime I see lightning, I'm debating shutting down my comp and unplugging it just because of the risk of lightning striking the house. Beyond that, the power also fluctuates heavily during some storms (it did yesterday). I know that PSUs don't like this kind of fluctuation.

I've seen some APC stuff at Staples for not too much ($50 for 390W), but I'm not sure what is exactly sufficient. Some are rated in Watts, but also share a VA rating.  I know my power supply is rated for 750W, but it will never hit that load anytime soon (possibly in the future with SLI). I'd like to not have to drop $200+ on a UPS if it's going to be extreme overkill.

I started off with a little more knowledge than most just because my mom is a programmer and her long time boyfriend is an IT guru. But in the last few months I went from wanting to buy a nice Dell to play BF3 on, to being convinced to build my own by a co-worker, to learning everything I can about computers and generally showing signs of an addict. I believe this sub-reddit is mostly at fault.

When I picked out the parts for my first build I knew next to nothing and my co-worker babied me through the entire process, and somehow I managed to put it together on my own. The same co-worker also introduced me to reddit. Soon after I stumbled across this sub-reddit, and started learning everything I probably should have known before I built in the first place.

So in the last few months I've been learning everything I can wrap my head around and saving every extra penny I make to spend on upgrades. I'd probably still be sitting with my [original build](http://redd.it/lvgdi) knowing nothing more than I did 6 months ago if it wasn't for [/r/gamingpc](/r/gamingpc) .

Overclocking Basics - Part 2: Memory (first half)
------------------------------------------------------

**A little warning (again)**

There is always a certain risk involved in overclocking. Especially (but not exclusively) when you start playing with the voltages you run the risk of damaging your system. Be aware this is your risk to take and your warranty  on components may be limited or nonexistent if you run your components outside of factory specifications. In other words, do this at your own risk.

**Memory basics**

First off, we need to talk a little about the basic workings of memory for you to understand what we're actually tweaking in order to predict / understand the outcome. Because memory is a little more complicated than the CPU I'll be limiting the information to DDR3 for the most part, assuming most of you gamers have a recent system.

**Clockspeed**

DDR stands for Double Data Rate. Double Data Rate means that the memory chips can serve up data twice per clockcycle. Why is this important? Well, for one: the data rate is what is specified when you talk about DDR3, not the clockspeed. This means that DDR3-1600 runs at a clockspeed of 800MHz! Now don't cry, it's still way faster than DDR2-800 which actually runs at a clockspeed of 400MHz so you didn't upgrade for nothing :-)

**Timings**

Back to why this is important though! As you may have noticed when selecting your RAM, the clockspeed (x2) is not the only thing that distinguishes one RAM stick from another. There's also the timings. You may have noticed specifications like DDR3-1600 8-8-8-24. The latter part are the timings. Because this is overclocking basics we'll concern ourselves only with the first number in the timings for now. The first 8 in the timings series is what is called the CAS latency. A CAS latency of 8 is also sometimes specified as ""CL8"". You might have seen this specified by someone bragging about their memory speed.

**CAS latency**

CAS latency is the number of clockcycles it takes for the memory to retrieve a piece of data from a memory address. So the lower the latency, the faster the RAM. As you may have noticed this is measured in clockcycles. This is why it's important to know that the clockspeed is 800MHz and not 1600MHz.

**Supported speeds**

Here is where it gets a little more interesting and a little more complicated as well. [Here]( http://i.imgur.com/2VBHf.png) is a screenshot of the memory timings on my PC. Both the BIOS and CPU-Z get these timing values from a table that is contained within your DIMM memory module so you can be sure this is accurate. The BIOS uses this information to automatically configure the right timings for your memory. That is: **unless you start overclocking!**. When you do you need to know what the timings mean because you need to calculate new ones if you clock the RAM on a different value than these predefined tables.

**Higher clockspeed is not always faster**

Yup, you read that correctly. Counterintuitive, I know, but true nonetheless. Consider these 2 calculations:

*First off, we take a module of DDR3-1333 CL6:*

* The clockrate of this module is 1333 / 2 = 666.5 MHz

* One clockcycle thus takes 1 / 666.5 millionth of a second. This translates as 1.5 nanoseconds

* The latency of this module is 6 clockcycles at this speed making the latency 6 x 1.5 nanoseconds = **9 nanoseconds**

*Secondly, we take a module of DDR3-1600 CL9*

* The clockrate of this module is 1600 / 2 = 800 MHz

* One clockcycle thus takes 1 / 800 millionth of a second. This translates as 1.25 nanoseconds

* The latency of this higher clocked module is 9 clockcycles, thus 9 x 1.25 nanoseconds = **11.25 nanoseconds!**

**The 1333 memory in this example is thus 25% faster than the 1600!!!**

Confused yet? I hope so, because I need some sleep :-) I'll take questions or lingering doubts about the veracity of this article when I'm a little more awake. It is however very true. Also, I'll continue the story on memory overclocking in a new thread on Friday. Earlier if I find the time :-)

**A sidenote:** *the same risks and reasons for overvolting memory apply that were stated in the first article about CPU overclocking.*

 (c) 2011, if you want to use this information on other places than this subreddit please contact the poster.

Any questions, corrections or comments are welcome!

Edit: as you can see, there's a lot more to know about RAM than there is about the CPU when it comes to overclocking. Story continues on Friday with the rest on memory clocking :-)

**Edit 2: If you're interested in the GPU keep following this, because it will help you to understand graphics overclocking :-)**

I already have a 5760 x 1080 setup but not many games support it but when they do support it I would like to utulize it. 

My idea is to have a 1440p monitor set up as the centre monitor and have a 1080p monitor mounted above it on a mount that can be lowered. That way I can just pull the monitor down and use the 5760x1080 setup. and when im finished i just switch it back to my 1440p monitor as the main display

Is there an easy way to do this? Has anyone done this already? I was thinking about some sort of DVI selector switch - but it would be nice to still utulzie all 4 monitors when I'm not gaming. 

Any suggestions?

Markus_Antonius	53	8	96	"I just tried to answer a question on videocards and what would/wouldn't run it on Ultra settings that got downvoted to death for whatever reason. That was the final drop of me getting tired of reading the same question over and over again. This post will be linked in the sidebar Battlefield 3 section for future reference and ""will this run BF3 on Ultra"" posts will be removed in the future.

System requirements for high
----------------------------

**CPU**

* Phenom II X4 965 or higher (X6, FX-6100, FX81xx)
* Core i5 2400 or higher (Core i5 2500K, any Core i7)

\* Battlefield 3 scales well over more than 4 cores (6 and even 8). We don't consider any dual core processors to be a solid investment for gaming anymore for reasons beyond the scope of this post. Obviously lower hardware will work too but we consider these requirements to be good enough for a fun experience. This info is provided on a best effort basis. If you need some sort of guarantee we suggest you look elsewhere before committing to buying anything.

**Graphics**

* GTX 560 1GB or higher (GTX 570, GTX 580)
* HD6870 1GB or higher (HD 6950, HD 6970)

Higher than the 560 or 6870 will allow for a combination of high/ultra settings and/or higher framerates and so will doubling up on those cards. 1GB cards are memory limited more than they are GPU limited so higher detail textures and high MSAA and AF will not work as well as they will on cards with 1.5GB memory or more. This memory limitation also applies to single monitor 1920x1080 setups!

System Requirements for Ultra
-----------------------------

* Dual GTX 580 1.5GB or higher
* Dual GTX 570 2.5 GB or higher
* Dual GTX 560 2GB or higher
* Dual HD6970 2GB or higher
* Dual HD6950 2GB or higher

The dual GPU cards GTX 590 (~ dual 580) and HD6990 (~ dual 6970) will obviously work as well.

1GB cards are not recommended for Ultra because they run out of memory which causes severe drops in framerate.

The ultra recommendations are based on wanting **a minimum of** 50 frames per second or higher on a 1920x1080 screen. It is assumed that if you want to play ultra you will also want framerates that actually allow you to beat someone else instead of being pwned at 30 frames/sec if the action gets intense.

If you are running very high resolution or multiple monitors questions are still welcome.

**Reminder on the rules: if you think something is wrong, dig up proof from a reliable source and post it. The text will be updated where appropriate and credit will be given. The moderators and many of the contributers here are software and/or hardware engineers so we generally know what we're saying. Unfortunately we don't have time to ""prove"" every single aspect of gaming and system loads.

I will choose the rig I like the most and user who posted it will recieve his key, also I will be taking into consideration how many upvotes it gets ex: if I choose a rig that got no upvotes I most likely will reconsider my choice. 

PLZ no phone photos, aestetics are important so plz take time to make good photos.

EDIT: CONTEST ENDS SATURDAY @ 18:00 !!!!!!!!




**EDIT:RESULTS:** 

* First place: /u/Makirole, reason for that is he have build that he used quite a lot of time on, although it is not fully complete it is very unique - custom side panel windows and separating plate inside the case. Also the cleanest build imo.
* Second Place: /u/squishy44, nice clean build. Didnt quite understend what Y fitting is for, but overall nice looking build

Unfortunatley there were not many good builds submited so there was no real competition for the first place :(

Hey guys, we've grown into a pretty awesome community, so I think it's time to try and set up a gaming/social event for our members (that's YOU!) to take part in!  All the details are marked ""tentative"" for now; I'd appreciate some feedback as to what you think about it. Depending on the turnout, there will be more game nights in the future, so don't worry if you can't' make it to this one (I don't expect all 4000+ subscribers to make it anyways, hehe).  I chose Battlefield 3 just based on the fact that we have a full platoon and an almost half-filled second platoon. Again based on your feedback, we might include some other games.  

I've set up a **Mumble** server for voice chat as well, and I invite you guys in to chat or hang out at any time (assuming I'm not applying updates). The address is:

**174.54.79.180 : 64738** (That's the default port, and there is no password).

Its kind of an awesome feeling getting a card that Windows can't recognize on its because its just that new.

One question: Are all Radeon cards this loud? I mean, holy shit, I thought the ""airline taking off"" joke was just a joke. Coming from a GTX 580, even at 100% the 580 just sounded like someone blowing air as hard as they can. At 40% we're matching that 100% of the 580. At 100%? Holy sweet baby Zeus this thing sounds like its circulating air for the entire PC. 

Or a fucking Dyson.

Besides that, driver needs some work too but I'm guessing they're working on that. I've been getting a weird behavior on its automatic fan profiling that quickly powers up and then powers down just by virtue of pulling down a menu or something.

------------------------------------------------------------

_______________________________________________________________________

Hey everybody. Well, by now we've all heard the news: AMD's new Bulldozer processors are out. Well, at least the retail version of the FX-8150 has finally made it's way to various sites and benchmarks are being published. These benchmarks are fully deserving of a few sidenotes however so let's address that first.

____________________________________________________________________

**A word on benchmarks**

Benchmarks are often taken as the end-all-be-all of CPU performance (as well as GPU performance) but this is not a very realistic picture. How well a CPU performs depends entirely on what you are using it for. Different architectures will perform better or worse than eachother based on the sort of application you are running on it. Different CPU architectures also come with different mainboards and chipsets and this also influences how your computer as a whole performs in different usage scenarios.

To put it bluntly and simply: the users on this subreddit are gamers. We're not calculating Pi to the 1 millionth decimal all day, we play games. Games don't calculate Pi either. 

So what do we do all day? Or, more to the point, what do games need our CPU for? Well, when gaming this boils down to a couple of things:

* The CPU does the game logic. This involves different stuff depending on what sort of game you are playing.

* The CPU calculates the physics of stuff that happens in your game world. I know a lot of you think this is done on the GPU but most of the time it's not. PhysX from NVidia is a wonderful thing but it's platform specific so game studios can't actually afford to depend on it being on a system. As a result all games can do without it and only a limited list actually benefits from PhysX on a GPU. 

* The CPU handles keyboard, mouse and joystick input.

* The CPU handles network input and output to and from a game server.

* The CPU generates rendering instructions and sends those to the GPU for processing.

* The CPU handles sound rendering.

Benchmarks generally don't test the stuff that is needed for game performance (excluding physics which is the only part of the game process that actually involves a lot of calculations).
How well a game performs thus depends on a great many things, most of which are not directly related to the calculation speed of the CPU. In other words, if you want to select the best CPU for your gaming system you need to consider the system as a whole. Looking at CPU benchmarks will tell you almost nothing about how your games will perform.

**So how about the Bulldozer FX chips?**


The reason this post is titled ""both too late and too early"" is because the launch of these processors came too late to compete with Intel processors on single-threaded performance (applications and games using only 1 core or *mostly* 1 core). Had Bulldozer been launched a little earlier it could have competed with the previous generation of Intel Core processors.

The reason it also says ""too early"" is because most games are still lagging far behind the hardware developments. Looking at the past year, Bad Company 2 is one of very few games that actually supported the use of more than 4 cores. Upcoming games might support more cores more efficiently but we won't know that for sure until they are actually released.

Programmers have always been able to rely on hardware getting faster every year so they never really bothered to rewrite their programs to take full advantage of multiple cores in a system. Much to the detriment of AMD only one upcoming game is known to scale flawlessly over any number of cores: Battlefield 3.

If you're building a gaming system specifically for Battlefield 3 an eight-core FX8150 is not a bad choice. Whether it will give you an advantage in other upcoming games remains to be seen. Building a game engine to scale is a complex and costly undertaking. It basically means re-engineering the entire game engine. However if other game studios don't follow suit, DICE will dominate the PC gaming landscape (and billion dollar market) for years to come.

When it comes to Battlefield 3 the Phenom II X6 is more cost effective than the i5. AMD has stated it will phase out the X6 in favor of the new FX processors so where does this leave the gamer?

_______________________________________________________

Unless AMD prices the FX-8150 at the level that the X6 is now it's not going to be a competitive choice for a gaming system. If the price is right I think it will be worth buying it with the knowledge that more games will take the DICE approach and make their games scale over many cores. Buying to future proof however only makes sense if it is also a solid economic choice at this very moment. If the price is between the X6 1100T and the i5 2500K I think the FX-8150 is a viable choice. If the price is upward of a 2500K I don't think it is.


Having said that: bear in mind that unless a quad core Sandy Bridge E is priced very close to where the i5 2500K is now, Sandy Bridge E will not be worth the money either.

________________________________________________

**The bottom line**

Bulldozer FX will only be a dud if it is not priced correctly and the same goes for the upcoming Sandy Bridge E. Your games will only really benefit from either CPU if the game programmers make the effort to really get the maximum out of these chips. When they finally do it will all be down to the pricing of the CPUs and accompanying mainboards which will be best bang for the buck. Both will be more than enough bang though.

A graphics card can ask for quite a bit of amperage from your PSU. Should the graphics card draw too much power from the 12V rail of your PSU the following things can be an indicator:

* The PSU's safety kicks in, it cuts power to your system and your computer turns off immediately and without warning.

* The PSU's safety doesn't kick in but the PSU is not able to retain a stable 12V power output and your computer will crash. This may give you the blue screen of death but it may also cause everything to freeze and your screen may go haywire or black.

* The PSU's safety doesn't kick in and various parts of your computer may start smoking or catch fire.

**What DOES NOT happen:**

* Your performance drops.

I hate to use the words ""Future Proof"", but what do you all see the future of the Titan being? As it is a single GPU card we know that it scales better than 680's or 690's. With the release of Maxwell cards in the (relatively) near future, how do you believe performance will hold up? Do you believe that when the 790's come out, two titans will outperform 790 sli? Is the prospect of running up to quad SLI with the Titans reason enough to go that route? 

I know that this is all speculation, but would it be safe to assume that because single GPU cards scale better than dual CPU cards, 3 TITAN GTX's will outperform SLI 790's, or even he highest tier Volta cards in SLI?

I am curious as to what opinion everyone holds on the GTX titan. Is it a strong and viable competitor for the future, or would one be better of with a 690 or SLI 680, then 790, then Volta-90 (890?).

Thank you for reading, /r/gamingpc !

Note: I do understand that you can get superior performance for the same price by purchasing wo 680's, however, this is considering the possibility for QUAD SLI with the Titan.

TLDR; Is the Single GPU Titan a mountain of possibility for the future, or will it become little more than a collectors item?"	t5_2sq2y	True

1315596135.0	kact9	[FAQ] Watercooling: a Beginner's guide	Helrich	52	11	40	"The following is a collection of common questions that I see beginner water cooling enthusiasts ask, including some questions I had when I was first starting out. Any specific questions you have can be asked in the comments section and I'll add them to the guide (if anyone has any good answers or explanations, I'll add those too!).

**Is installing water cooling in a computer hard?**
It's really not much different than building a PC for the first time. You can become fairly well educated by reading guides, but until you have your parts and start getting your feet ""wet"" so to speak, you'll probably find that you might have forgotten or miscalculated something. When I built my first loop, I got fittings that weren't compatible with the radiator. Nowadays when I'm doing a water build, that's always one of the things I check.

**Is the cost and effort worth justifying adding a water loop?**
There are really two reasons to water cool.  The first, and most obvious is in situations where components are running very hot (overclocking, multi-gpu set-ups).  Water dissipates roughly 4 times the amount of heat that air can, so you can expect better performance out of your hardware while having relatively low temps. The second reason to water cool is for noise issues. At normal usage with a fan controller, the loudest part of my system is the power supply, and even that is pretty quiet.  The nature of water cooling allows for much lower fan speeds.

**What parts are required to water cool?**
This is where reading guides and checking out other people's water cooled systems really helps, but I'll provide some advice and a basic guide here. There are 6 essential parts to every water-cooling system:

 * Pump
 
 * Reservoir

 * Radiator (and fans)

 * The water block(s)
 
 * Tubing and fittings

 * Liquid coolant 

Sure, there are other doodads like pump tops, flow meters, temp sensors, etc. that can be very useful, but these aren't necessary for the basic function of the loop.
As far as what particular parts work best as well as where costs can be cut, consider the following examples. 

 * Pump - You'll need a pump to cycle water through your loop. One of the most popular pumps is the Laing D5. This pump is incorporated into a couple different pump bodies, such as the Swiftech MCP655, which includes a variable flowrate dial for controlling the speed at which the pump operates. There are different pumps with different power levels, but when in doubt, get the more powerful pump.

 * Reservoir - The reservoir is a coolant holding tank, which primarily is used for releasing air bubbles trapped in the loop. There are a few different kinds of reservoirs. A tube reservoir is a cylinder with fittings that you mount to your case. There are also bay reservoirs, which mount in one or more 5.25"" external drive bays. A lot of times, bay reservoirs have a compartment to hold the pump, which allows for more space savings as well as money savings for tubing and fittings. Spend as much as you want on the reservoir, as there generally isn't much difference in functionality, but more expensive reservoirs typically have more flashy LEDs or other custom flair.

 * Radiator (and fans) - The radiator is where the heat exchange takes place. The most common sizes are in multiples of 120mm or 140mm fan sizes (i.e. a 240mm radiator accommodates 2 120mm fans.).  The most common radiator design is the 360mm, which accommodates 3 120mm spaced 15mm apart. The Corsair 800D case as well as some others have a mounting point for this size radiator.  The two factors to look at when choosing a radiator are dissipation efficiency (how much air must flow through the fins to get rid of heat) and flow choking (how much the design of the fins restricts water flow). Most cheap radiators are pretty good at both of these, and I've never had a problem with cheap radiators, but certain radiators allow for very low fan speeds and also don't restrict flow nearly as much.

 * The water block(s) - The water blocks are the interface between the water and the chips you want to cool.  There are blocks for CPUs, GPUs (just the chip or full card coverage), MOSFETs, Chipsets, RAM, and hard drives, ordered from most commonly used to least commonly used.  Even the cheapest blocks (generally speaking) will allow for better heat transfer than an air-cooled heatsink, but blocks made from better materials or with better flow designs will obviously allow for better dissipation.  Pick a price range and read reviews on different blocks in that range when deciding. Popular brands are EK, DangerDen, Koolance.

 * Tubing and fittings - These components obviously are what enables the water to flow between the above listed parts. Tubing is generally pretty cheap, but there are some differences to note. First of all, you can get clear, UV reactive, or solid colored and the only difference here is personal taste. Note though that anti-microbial tubing typically comes in a silver color, and brand-name Tygon tubing typically comes in black. Anti-microbial tubing is a nice feature for avoiding algae growth but as we'll see in the next bullet isn't necessary. Fittings are the metal pieces that attach and seal the tubing to the parts of the loop. There are two main types of fittings: compression fittings and barbs. Barbs are cheaper and the price savings definitely add up, but take the following piece of advice into consideration: *EVERY LEAK I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LOOPS HAS COME FROM BARBS (EVEN WHEN TUBE CLAMPS ARE USED!)* As a result, I highly recommend dishing out for compression fittings. It could save you from a nasty headache.

 * Liquid coolant - You cannot simply use tap water in your loop, or you'll have a science fair project growing in your computer in no time. A lot of coolants that you buy by the bottle include a biocide in them to kill off any organisms in the water. Bottled coolants also can come with colored dyes in them for aesthetics. Some argue that the dyes will over time add to corrosion or plaque buildup in the loop, but I cannot vouch one way or the other. I've always used distilled water with one drop of PT-Nuke per liter. Never had algae. 


**Is there any maintenance involved?**
Yes.  I usually change the coolant in my system twice a year. That means draining the old coolant out, flushing the loop with clean distilled water, and refilling the loop. This is ESPECIALLY important if you use dyed coolant, because it tends to ""gunk up"" over time. Don't wait until you start seeing algae growth in the tubing. If you do see some, then there's a good chance that the blocks/radiator have some too, so you'll need to soak them in a bleach solution to loosen the algae. To deal with mineral deposits and buildup, add a 25% mixture of distilled white vinegar to the coolant and cycle it for at least an hour.

**Where should I buy water cooling parts from?**
Newegg carries a very limited supply of water cooling parts. If they have the part you want, then by all means go for it (assuming they have a good price).  The majority of parts I buy come from [FrozenCPU](http://www.frozencpu.com). Other good places to check are [Sidewinder Computers](http://www.sidewindercomputers.com) and [Performance PCs](http://www.performance-pcs.com). Another decent site is [Xoxide](http://www.xoxide.com), although there prices and selection isn't quite as good.  Also check out hardware stores, sometimes you may find something not necessarily ""for"" PC water cooling, but that will work. For example, I recently found out about [SharkBite](http://www.sharkbite.com), a company that makes fittings for PEX tubing. They make plastic elbow barb fittings for 1/2"" and 3/4"" that cost under $2.00 a piece. This is a really nice alternative considering that 90 degree rotaries cost between $17-20!

just a short housekeeping message here to please be mindful of our rules against speculation. We've set up this forum from the beginning to keep information as accurate as possible to avoid disappointments or even failing components due to overclocking or other tweaking.

Please be aware of the following examples:

* Don't leave the impression that overclocking (and/or overvolting) any component is ""safe"". By extension, also please don't ask for ""safe overclocking"" or ""safe voltage"" settings. The only safe voltage is stock voltage and the only safe clockspeed is stock clockspeed. Chips are set to a specific voltage or voltage range at the factory and these voltages may differ for 2 CPUs/GPUs of the exact same model number. This means that a voltage that does not break someone else's 7970 may well break yours. Announcing safe voltages or asking for them is therefore against our rules. By all means ask people about their ""comfort zone"" but **do not** ask people what is safe. Damage to components does not appear to occur often but exact figures are unknown. Also be aware that the GPU is not the only part of the videocard that can get too hot but it is the only part that will tell you so. If you blow the voltage regulation your card will be just as dead and you have no indication or warnings. This applies to CPUs and a lot of mainboards as well.

* Bottlenecks are not always in the same place. Your computer can bottleneck on the CPU in one game while it bottlenecks on the graphics card in another game. ""Will X bottleneck Y"" can therefore not be generalized easily. Besides the game, this will also depend on the screen resolution you are playing on, whether you are in multiplayer or single player mode and even in some cases on whether your (dual) cards run on PCIe 3.0 x16/x16 or PCIe 3.0 x8/x8. A lot of sites benchmark on single screens with single videocards or on low resolutions. If x8/x8 vs x16/x16 does not make a difference in one particular test does not mean that there is no difference *ever*. Saying that something does not make a difference is therefore risky, even when you quote multiple sources. We have a lot of people gaming on 3 monitors with dual cards and the tests so far seem to show that in that scenario it actually makes a pretty big difference. You'll be hard pressed to find those benchmarks from reviewers but we are in the process of running more of these tests ourselves. Statements like ""you'll never need more than a &lt;insert here&gt;"" are therefore risky because they can earn you a ban if they turn out to be incorrect.

Having read ""xyztech.com"" does not make you an expert so if you don't know, please resist the temptation to speculate. Please help us keep up the quality of information provided in this sub.

Considering how many mice threads are out there I thought it would be a good idea to get some objective opinion on everyone's mice. Someone did one a few years ago, but many new mice have come out since and is long overdue for a update (You can view that one at https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AtxNAmTrTcySdEo0NktYanAwbUhSWFlmMlQ5dWxGQmc&amp;gid=0 in the meantime).

Instead of having seperate threads, multiple upvotes, and things like ""WOW MY MICES IS GRATE IT HAVE BIG DPI"" people will just be able to look at the results of this survey and get a good idea of what kind of mice they might like to buy with a more rounded perspective and compare it to others. 

I'll leave this open for about a week to get a nice number of responses and then start going through results and post a new thread with them in it.

Feel free to leave feedback in the comments and spread the survey link around to your friends.

Thank you :D

Update: Have a little teaser for you guys. So far, 147 people have taken the survey. I did a partial tabulation of 121 of those for your benefit as well as to cut down on data inaccuracy.

_________________________________________

I've been wanting to do an article for a while now that focuses on aspects of performance that a lot of people tend to ignore. A lot of people look at benchmarks to get some idea of the frames-per-second advantage gained by for instance adding a second graphics card. A lot of people also tend to want to 'max out' games. While I certainly understand wanting to have eye-candy I see a lot of people putting the eye-candy ahead of gameplay.
I can imagine some of you thinking ""but my rig does 60 frames per second maxed out so it won't matter right?"" Wrong actually.

**Why 60 frames per second is not really 60 frames per second**

To explain this statement we need to dig a little deeper into how monitors work and how monitors and graphics cards work together.
A monitor has what's called a ""refresh rate"". For most current monitors this refresh rate is at 60Hz. What this means is that a monitor redraws the screen every 1/60th of a second. Saying ""every 1/60th of a second"" rather than ""60 frames per second"" is important for what I'm trying to explain. **A monitor can't draw 60 frames per second, it can draw a new frame every 1/60th of a second!!**

**So what's the difference?**

Well, here's the difference. 1/60th of a second is about 16.7 milliseconds. 3D scenes that are being rendered by your graphics card sometimes takes 9ms and sometimes 18 or maybe even 33 ms some of the time. This is because as you walk around in a game world, look around, encounter an enemy etc. the scene is sometimes just a little more complex than other times. Whenever rendering a scene takes longer than 16.7 ms it shows as stutter, especially (**but not exclusively**) if you have enabled vsync.

What's more, every time a new frame is drawn the latest user input from your keyboard and mouse is taken into account so your game responds faster when the framerate gets higher. This remains true even at well over 60 frames per second. Or in other words: getting a high-dpi fast gaming mouse is a useless expenditure if your frame rate is just about 60. Or to put it differently yet: 60 frames per second on ultra settings or 90 frames per second on high settings can make the difference between getting pwned (60 fps) or getting promoted (90 fps).

**Elusive performance gains**

A better graphics card or maybe an SLI or Crossfire setup may not seem to make much of a difference to the naked eye when looking at benchmarks but while researching smooth gameplay I came across some very interesting measurements in an article that researched Crossfire and Triple Crossfire setups.

Take a look at this graph: [HD6870 vs Dual HD6870 vs Triple HD6870]( http://media.bestofmicro.com/Crossfire-SLI-stuttering,W-K-300548-22.png)

What you see here is that Dual 6870 more or less doubles the framerate. Triple 6870 also more or less doubles the framerate **however**: the triple 6870 setup has very smooth framerates across the board. Looking at the triple 6870 in a frames per second benchmark would prompt most people to yell: ""triple 6870 is bullshit, you're throwing away your money!!!!"". And unfortunately most reviews only include the frames per second counter as a benchmark.
As you can see from the graph, a single 6870 is not throwing away your money and neither is triple 6870. From a gameplay experience point of view, if anything is ""throwing away money"" then the dual 6870 would qualify most of all.

_____________________________________________

**Memory restrictions**

I've been doing a lot of measurements on Battlefield 3 gameplay on what most of us probably have: a single 1920x1080 monitor. When doing measurements something else caught my eye. For running the game on ultra you really need extra headroom in the videomemory department. By now this is well-known but I want to share with you a pretty good way to tune your performance using MSI Afterburner (unfortunately this only works on NVidia based cards).
Instead of using it only to overclock your videocards you can use it for something much more interesting. Dual GTX560 1GB has enough rendering power for ultra settings but unfortunately it does not have enough memory (one of the reasons you see the first 2GB 560s popping up now).

____________________________________________

MSI Afterburner allows you to show the video memory usage in the on-screen display. If you start by setting the game on all high and play for a few minutes you can see how your videoram usage behaves. As long as it stays below 980MB the game stays very playable, however as soon as it regularly gets above this value the game starts what's called ""resource streaming"". What this means is that while rendering a particular frame the driver needs to free up space on the videocard and load new objects to be rendered in that frame from your PC's main memory to the video memory. This takes quite a bit of time (remember, we want to stay below 16.7ms if we can!) and so the game starts to see significant frame drops. When the action is at it's highest (lots of objects on the screen!) it drops even further.

Tuning the settings down so the game doesn't max out the videomemory prevents these performance degradations from happening almost completely!

___________________________________________

That's it for part 1, as usual comments or questions are welcome. I'm still doing some research and measurements for part 2 but I expect to post it a little later this week!

----------------------------------------------------------

_______________________________________________________

Hey all! I've noticed a lot of scepticism surrounding multi-core gaming systems as well as a lot of myths on this subject like the one that ""more than 4 cores will never make a difference"", ""some games don't support SLI"" to name just two.

**Dual core**

_________________________________________________________

This is where all the confusion really started. When the first dual cores hit the market, gamers started buying them like crazy, dreaming of twice the performance. Little did they know that because dual processor systems had never been mainstream that game developers never had the need to support them. 

Dual processor and quad processor systems (x86 based) have existed since the late 90s (I programmed the first of these back in 1998). Programming these isn't any different than today's dual and quad core processors though.

These multiprocessor systems were not in any living room or PC gamer's warroom however, so programming to make use of more than 1 core would have required lots of time with no return on investment for game programmers. 

Dual core did bring a slight advantage to gamers though because part of the operating system (Windows) would always be running on the free core so the operating system would take up a smaller part of the processing power from the core the game was running on.

**Quad core**

________________________________________________________

With the introduction of the quad core processors, dual core started to become mainstream and so part of the development community started to redesign their game engines to make use of 2 cores at least part of the time. Tasks while rendering a frame that could be easily split off to run on a second core were split off. This is however a far cry from true multicore support. 

True multicore support requires that you try to split up as much work as you can. This involves dividing the calculations (game logic) in to parts that you send to different threads (=cores in this case) in order to be processed. While this may sound easy **it requires the entire game engine to be redesigned almost from the ground up.** Not only do the programmers have to split up the work in to smaller tasks but sometimes one task needs another task to be completed first because it needs the data that was produced in the first task.

**More than 4 cores**

__________________________________________________________

By mid 2010 it started to become clear that more than 4 cores was going to be a reality. With advances in process technology (32 nm was in sight) it was becoming easier to stuff more cores on to a processor die. 

At the same time, optimizing the way instructions were processed (so as to speed up single threaded performance) was reaching physical limits. So not only did it become cheaper to put more cores on a die, it started to become necessary as well.

Game developers are now (2010) starting the process of upgrading their game engines to make effective use of more than four cores. The easiest way to do this is to split up the work in as many little pieces as possible. 
Additionally you'll need a task scheduler in the game engine that distributes these pieces over the cores. At the same time this scheduler needs to make sure that tasks that require output from other tasks are run in the correct order **and if necessary wait on eachother.**

Since sometimes tasks wait on other tasks **you will never see a multicore system maxed out by a game! This does not imply at all that the games are not using the extra cores and benefitting from them.** It's simply an unavoidable reality that you will never max out *any* multicore system during gaming. The more cores you have, the smoother a game will run on these new engines. 

____________________________________

*Azurphax raised a valid point below in the comments. While you technically won't max out 4 cores for example, you can get close to doing so. The better an application can chop up the workload the closer you can get. Ofcourse the workload would need to be big enough as well. The jitter in the CPU usage graph at these loads is cores waiting on eachother. His comment however does prove one of the points I'm trying to make with these articles: more than 4 core systems can make a difference in gaming and while it's true that a quad core i5 can still handle any current game it's a bit of a near-sighted assumption that it will stay that way for longer than 12 months. This can go very much both ways in the coming year.*

_______________________________________

Ofcourse there are still limits above which you'll notice no more improvement **but this limit is not at 4 cores.** Where this limit is would depend mostly on the game and game engine driving it.

**Game engine design**

______________________________________________

Bear in mind that quad cores have only recently become mainstream and that re-development of game engines has only recently started. That's why **currently** you don't see many games benefit from more than 4 cores. Remember though that even if a game doesn't max out your quad core this doesn't mean that it won't benefit from more. It's simply impossible to max out multiple cores all the time. 

Here's a [**design slide for Frostbite 2**](http://i.imgur.com/2ib2x.png), the engine created by DICE to power Battlefield 3. You can see that the engine is being designed with 2-16 hardware threads in mind. 

These are **full hardware threads**, not hyperthreads. Hyperthreading requires additional redesign and since this was not discussed in the [DICE presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/repii/parallel-futures-of-a-game-engine-v20) it is doubtful the Frostbite 2.0 engine will benefit from Hyperthreading. Every full core will consume tasks in a specific order and in this design the number of cores present is not limited to 4 cores.

Okay now that we have the mainboard basics down, let's do a basic overview of the CPU. I will answer any questions on the mainboard in the previous post and if we need to I'll revisit the mainboard later on.

The CPU
---------

There are a number of things of importance about the CPU when building a gaming PC:

**The package** 

This is the other side of the socket if you will, a CPU in an 1155 package will fit in a socket 1155, AM3 package will fit in AM3 as well as AM3+, a 1366 package will fit in socket 1366 and so on. Socket 1155 has 1155 pins running from the CPU to the mainboard, 1366 has 1366 pins, AM3 has 941 pins and AM3+ 942 pins. The lower number of pins on AM3 and AM3+ is due to the PCI express lanes not running from the CPU but from the northbridge chip. More or less pins does not mean faster or slower.

The package really is just a package [as you can see in this picture here of a Core i7](http://i.imgur.com/4RLHN.png) :-) The shiny piece of silicon in the middle of the package is the actual processor (or: what you pay your ~$200 for)! The metal casing that usually encloses this is really the first stage of the heatspreader :-)

**Processor cores**

Moving on to what is actually in (or on) that piece of silicon, obviously there will be 1-8 processor cores on there. 

**Cache**

It used to be that cache was not as overlooked as it seems to be lately. The cache memory of a processor is actually **one of the most important factors that determine performance!** The general rule here is that the larger the cache the better the performance. There is a point at which larger cache is going to slow the processor down (we'll talk about why that is later) but the cache sizes on modern processors are obviously not so large that this occurs (who buys a more expensive CPU that is slower?).

That last pun leads us to another factor of how cache size is determined. Cache memory on the CPU is a special and ultra fast kind of memory that takes up a lot of space on the processor die. Making it larger costs money but it also takes up space that is sometimes better used for putting an extra processing core on that same die. So usually the cache size and the number of cores are a compromise that (should) make for the optimal performance.

To give you an idea of how big that cache area is in a real-world example, [here is a closeup picture of the Core i7 die](http://i.imgur.com/29qPM.jpg). This also shows the other components that are on the processor, described below.

Since we're on the subject of cache, the main reason that the Core i7 is faster than the Core i5 is it's larger cache size of 8MB vs 6MB. This is over 30% extra cache on the i7. Contrary to popular belief it is thus the larger cache that makes it faster and not the overhyped hyperthreading! Hyperthreading actually slows down a lot of programs that are not specifically adapted to using it. Turning it off on a gaming PC leads to basically an i5 with 30% more cache and most likely a better overclockable processor than the i5 2500K. Better overclockable is due to the i5 and i7 basically being the same processor with some features disabled at the factory (also called foundry). The dies that come out top-notch become i7s and the ""lesser"" dies get some stuff disabled and become i5s :-)

Now back for a minute to why cache matters. The fact is that **most of the operations that a processor does takes place in the cache**. A processor in the old days read an instruction from memory, performed an operation and then went on to read the next instruction from memory. Modern processors read those instructions from their cache and this cache is intelligent enough to predict what is needed next and fetches this information from the main memory into the cache before it's actually needed. 6MB of cache for instructions is actually huge. It fits the entire text of the Bible at least 1.5 times! A lot of what a computer does is loops in which the same series of instructions is carried out a certain number of times. As a result the CPU does not need to access the main memory very often. **This is the primary reason you don't see any benefits from faster memory!!** Only in tasks like video encoding does main memory usage spike but for the vast majority of stuff that a CPU does the memory speed really doesn't matter all that much! This is also the reason that overclocking your CPU without overclocking the memory gets very good results: with overclocking the CPU you are also overclocking the CPU cache.

**The memory controller**

As was stated in the mainboard post, the memory controller determines how many memory channels a processor can handle. For both AM3+ and 1155 packaged processors this is dual channel. For 1366 processors this is triple channel and for the new LGA 2011 processors (Sandy Bridge E) this is quad channel. 

This memory controller also determines what type of memory can be hooked up to the processor (for AM3+ and 1155 this is DDR3) and the speed of that memory. For AM3 this speed is up to DDR3-1333 but most AM3 mainboards allow you to overclock the memory controller and thus have speeds of DDR3-1600 and higher. For Sandy Bridge and Bulldozer higher speeds are supported out of the box.

(Integrated graphics)

As you can see, with Sandy Bridge processors the integrated graphics is also on the processor die. For AMD chipsets with integrated graphics this GPU part is on the northbridge die. The 9xx series of AMD chipsets however does not have any integrated graphics.

Inside the cores
----------------

One of the main reasons why current Intel processors are faster than current AMD processors has to do with the way things are organized inside the cores themselves. As I explained earlier, basically all a CPU does all day long is fetch an instruction from memory (cache), carry out that instruction and then move on to the next. The reason Intel processors are currently faster is - simply but accurately put - the fact that inside the cores themselves the Intel processors are organized more efficiently. This allows the Intel core to process more instructions in a given amount of time than it's AMD counterpart. 

Manufacturing process
-----------------------

Year after year the transistors (building blocks that chips consist of) get smaller. Current Sandy Bridge processors are manufactured on what's called a 32nm (nanometer) manufacturing process while AMD's Phenom II processors are still manufactured on a 45nm process (Bulldozer is also 32nm). The smaller the transistors on the die are the less excess heat they generate and the cooler a processor will run. Besides running cooler the processor will also use less power. This is the primary reason that older processors run hotter than the current Sandy Bridge processors. I cringed just a few weeks ago when a reviewer was surprised that the ""Hyper 212+ cools an i5 better than a Phenom II"". This is a load of bullcrap. The Phenom II simply produces more heat!

With smaller transistors achievable clockspeeds also get higher. [A brilliant explanation of why this is can be found in ***Dascandy's*** comment below, thanks a bunch for that one!](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/mexd9/basic_pc_architecture_part_2_cpu/c30hwbw) 

Smaller transistors is one of the reasons you can clock your i5 a little higher than your Phenom II. I'm purposely saying ""a little"" here because contrary to popular belief not nearly all i5 processors can reach 4.5GHz. In fact most of them hit a brick wall at around 4.2 - 4.3 GHz while the Phenom II hits this wall at 3.9 - 4.0. Only 100-300MHz difference in most cases. 

While we're on the subject of manufacturing: CPUs (and all other chips) are made using a process called ""lithography"". Basically this means that transistors are etched onto a clean, empty silicon surface in much the same way as photo's were developed before the age of digital cameras. This process is not an exact process, meaning that some processor dies come out better than others in the factory. This makes each and every processor die unique and is the reason why one i5 will produce more heat than another i5 with the exact same model number. It is also the reason that ""stock voltage"" is differerent for each and every single i5 (or any other processor). The stock voltage for a processor is entered into it at the factory. If your processor runs a few degrees hotter than your friends identical processor with identical coolers there is nothing wrong with yours, this is just luck of the draw. It's also the reason that some i5 processors can overclock higher than other ""identical"" i5 processors. There is nothing wrong with yours, just don't forget that even the i5 2500K is only guaranteed to operate successfully on stock clocks!

**Edit:** For those that want to know more, [here is a video that gives you an overview of how a processor is produced](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLGAoGhoOhU). The [packaging process that takes place afterward is nicely covered here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YITsrpOZsL0).

Also, it was suggested in the comments that I add a little on locked and unlocked multipliers. Just be aware of this: if you want to overclock a Sandy Bridge processor you will need a version with what is called an ""unlocked multiplier"". The i5 2500K is one such unlocked processor. AMD processors can also be overclocked fairly well if they have a locked multiplier although this is somewhat more involved. Most high-end AMD processors come only in the unlocked variety however so there's really no reason to buy a locked AMD processor to save money. More information on multipliers can be found in the overclocking guide in the sidebar.

That's it for part 2, sooner than promised :-) Any questions / comments welcome!

Overclocking Basics - Part 3: Memory (second half)
---------------------------------------------------------

**CAS latency revisited**

As you remember from the previous article we only looked at CAS latency combined with the memory clock speed. These two are the easiest factors to determine what speeds you'll be getting from your memory. Keep in mind though that these are ofcourse not the only factors. Once a specific memory address is being accessed, the memory addresses immediately following it can be accessed more quickly. This leads to an advantage is some cases. When not having to access subsequent memory locations however, this advantage disappears.

**CPU cache**

Back to the CPU? Yep, back to the CPU. As many of you know the CPU has what's called a cache. The CPU cache is really a copy of a small part of the main memory. The CPU uses this cache memory to access it's instructions at a much higher speed than your DDR3 DIMMs can provide. 

CPU cache sizes have gotten larger in recent years and you might know already that the larger the CPU cache, the more performance you'll get out of your CPU. This is true up to a point but both AMD and Intel are very good at determining where that point is so in general the rule ""the larger the cache the faster the CPU"" holds true.

It's important to know about the CPU cache because these days it can grow as big as 6 megabytes, sometimes even bigger. **6 megabytes of data doesn't seem like a lot these days but in reality it is. The complete unabridged text of the bible would fit 1.5 times ;-)** Programs you run on your computer may be as large as 20 megabytes or more but the part of that file that is really program code is much smaller. The vast amount of data that's in a program is graphics, text and even sound data. 

If you take today's games that ratio is even more skewed. In today's games well over 99% of the space they take up is pure data. Far less than 1% is actual instructions for the computer.

While most of a program might be loaded into the computer's main memory when that program is started up, in a lot of cases the CPU only needs frequent access to the part that comprises it's instructions. For the most part what the CPU needs will be loaded into it's cache from the main memory and these instructions are often used several thousand times before the CPU is required to load new instructions from the main memory into it's cache.

**This is the reason memory overclocking doesn't give you a real performance edge!**

It's true that for some specific scenarios faster memory might be beneficial but normally the main memory is being accessed at intervals that 1333 memory can easily provide.

Gaming (this is a gaming subreddit after all) hardly benefits at all from increased memory speeds, except when it needs to transfer large amounts of data from the main memory to the video memory. These transfers generally involve a piece of continous memory so that can be accessed and transfered really quickly. With games getting as big as they are graphics wise, you might see a small performance benefit there.

**For the most part however, overclocking memory will give you a very marginal advantage compared to overclocking the CPU. When overclocking the CPU you also overclock the CPU cache and that's the memory that currently really matters performance-wise.**

If you can afford fast memory then by all means do, but as you can see the knowledge required for effectively overclocking slower memory outweighs probably any benefit you may gain, except for insight into a computers inner workings :-)

**GPU memory**

Now there's an entirely different story. As you may have noticed, the memory on a video card is of an entirely different type than the memory that sits on your DIMMS. This is with good reason!

A videocard's main job when (3d) gaming is to take textures (skins for 3D objects in the game) and fold them around 3D objects using mathematical transformations, and putting the resulting picture in what we call a framebuffer. The framebuffer is a piece of memory within the videoram that is sent to your monitor, which then presents it as a picture.

The way a GPU accesses it's videomemory thus severely differs from the way a CPU accesses it's main memory! A GPU accesses the videomemory billions of times per second when it's drawing you a 3D picture. That's why videomemory is way more expensive. It has to be much faster than the main memory that sits on your DIMMS. 

It's also the reason video memory (GDDR5) runs much hotter. As you may have noticed, video memory usually has heatsinks. Normal memory doesn't require this. Manufacturers put heatspreaders on main memory for show but at the speeds they run at it's not really neccesary.

As you may have surmised the memory talk served primarily as a warning not to put too much effort in it (the returns are marginal) and as a way to introduce you to memory that matters more :-)

**Next up: The GPU :-) I will try to get to this tomorrow!**

1. Razethew0rld (tek syndicate) you may remember the host, Logan, from TigerDirectTV back in the day. Since then he has left TigerDirect and has been focusing on Tek Syndicate. He is currently my favorite as he uploads weekly news episodes of general technology news, as well as GPU and other hardware reviews. He manages to break the line between formal and in-formal reviews meaning it is a somewhat laid back approach however all the in-depth information is there. I would highly recommend checking him out if you haven't heard of him before :)
www.youtube.com/Razethew0rld

2. TimeToLiveCustoms (Tiny Tom Logan) A fairly big name in the Hardware reviewing world. His reviews stand out as he exceeds in going into a large amount of detail with each product he reviews, with reviews ranging from 20 minutes - 60 minutes long. If you see him review a piece of hardware you were thinking about picking up, you should definitely watch to learn the ins and outs of the product before buying.
www.youtube.com/user/TimeToLiveCustoms

3. LinusTechTips. Yes, I know what you're thinking... But I however really enjoy his unboxings and the occasional review he puts up. He has the ability to explain things in a very clear and understandable way without dragging on. Due to working for such a large company he also tends to be able to unbox and benchmark products on the due of release or several days before. He may be overly positive about some products (but hey, its his job to advertise these products) but is still informative and does tell you certain limitations of some pieces of hardware.

A graphics card can ask for quite a bit of amperage from your PSU. Should the graphics card draw too much power from the 12V rail of your PSU the following things can be an indicator:

* The PSU's safety kicks in, it cuts power to your system and your computer turns off immediately and without warning.

* The PSU's safety doesn't kick in but the PSU is not able to retain a stable 12V power output and your computer will crash. This may give you the blue screen of death but it may also cause everything to freeze and your screen may go haywire or black.

* The PSU's safety doesn't kick in and various parts of your computer may start smoking or catch fire.

**What DOES NOT happen:**

* Your performance drops.

1322394547.0	mqsq1	Myth vs. Fact: Gen3 Mainboards and PCI express 3.0	Markus_Antonius	40	1	21	"Hey everybody,

just a small post in a series that will address common misconceptions and misuse of buzzwords. Since there seems to be a lot of confusion regarding PCI express 3.0, this post is dedicated to that subject.

What is PCI express 3.0?
------------------------

I will only address the most basic aspect of PCI express 3.0 in this post: transfer speed and related bandwidth. There is more that separates 3.0 from 2.0 but for the purpose of this discussion it's of less importance.

The transfer speed of PCI express 3.0 is double that of PCI express 2.0 (or 2.x for that matter) ***per lane***.

Effectively this means that when using a single graphics card on an x16 (= 16 lane) PCIe 3.0 connection vs. a 16 lane PCIe 2.0 connection, the transfer speed between your main memory and your graphics card will double. **It will however only double if your graphics card supports PCIe 3.0! If you use a PCIe 2.0 card on a 3.0 bus the transfer speed will go down to PCIe 2.0 speeds!**

Gen3 mainboards and Sandy Bridge processors
--------------------------------------------

In Sandy Bridge architecture the PCI express lanes that connect to your graphics card run from the CPU. Sandy Bridge CPUs only support PCI express 2.x connections. **In effect this means that if you are using a Sandy Bridge CPU (ANY Sandy Bridge CPU) you won't be using the Gen3 facilities of your mainboard and your PCI express connections will be 2.x!!!**

Only Gen3 boards with a socket 1155 **Ivy Bridge** processor will be able to use PCI express 3.0 and only **if the graphics card(s) are also PCI express 3.0.** In ever other case you will be using PCI express 2.x!!!

Dual card configurations
-----------------------

As stated earlier the bandwidth per lane doubles. In effect this means that if you are running Crossfire or SLI on a x8/x8 mainboard and you are running at 3.0 speed, this solution will be just as fast as x16/x16 on 2.0 speed. Again, this will only happen if both your graphics cards support PCI express 3.0 as well as your CPU (Ivy Bridge) and your mainboard (Gen3). If ANY of these do not support PCI express 3.0 your speeds will be PCI express 2.0!!!

Given the fact that there is not a lot of performance difference between x8/x8 and x16/x16 right now, it's reasonable to assume there won't be a big difference between 2.0 and 3.0 for the foreseeable future!

""Saturating"" the connection
---------------------------

I always get a headache when people talk about ""saturating"" a PCI express connection because using that word implies that they don't understand what is going on at all. Please let me enlighten you:

* Transfers of information to your graphics card over the PCI express bus happen from your main memory via the PCI express bus to your graphics card memory. How fast this happens depends on the transfer speed of your main memory and the speed of your CPU has absolutely nothing to do with it!!!

* 1333 single channel memory has a bandwidth of 10.6GB/s and a PCIe 2.0 x16 slot has a bandwidth of 8GB/s. A PC with DDR3 1333 memory will thus ""saturate"" a PCI express 2.0 x16 connection for the duration of a transfer.

* 1333 dual channel memory has a bandwidth of 21.2 GB/s and a PCIe 3.0 x16 slot has a bandwidth of 16GB/s. Any PC with DDR3-1333 dual channel memory will thus ""saturate"" a PCI express 3.0 connection for the duration of a transfer.

* Only 1 PCI express device at a time can do a transfer so it doesn't matter if you have 2, 3 or 4 graphics cards at x16 3.0 (if that existed). The bus will always be ""saturated"" with every transfer!

* The faster a transfer is done to one graphics card the sooner another transfer to another graphics card can happen so speed **does matter in the end!** It just doesn't depend on the factors most people think it depends on!

The bottom line
---------------

* There is no point in buying a Gen3 mainboard if you are not planning to buy both an Ivy Bridge processor and Gen3 videocards! Absolutely no point. Ever.

* Speed matters but it will be a while still before we start to notice it in real world gaming scenarios.

Questions welcome as always.

1319173721.0	ljltr	A word on Power Supplies - Part 1	Markus_Antonius	43	2	33	"**A word on Power Supplies - Part 1**

This post has been in the making for a while because there is quite a lot to say about computer PSUs. A lot of people used to consider the PSU one of the least important parts of a PC that they preferred to spend as little money as possible on. Others think that when overclocking and installing dual graphics cards they are in need of a huge power supply and race towards the 1000W models.

__________________

Our demographic - the enthusiasts - have known for a while that the power supply is actually one of the more important parts in a PC but still the parameters by which we choose them aren't always the correct ones. Time to clear up some of the questions on the subject of power supplies.

__________________

To kick off part one I thought I'd start with a list of commonly asked questions. With each answer we'll also dive into related stuff as it comes up.

**Does a 1000W PSU use more electricity than a 500W PSU?**

No. How much a PSU uses depends on how much the components it supplies power to are demanding. In other words, as long as the power demand stays under 500W both power supplies will use roughly the same amount of power. 

***However:*** the two power supplies may have a different *efficiency*. How efficient a power supply is also varies as the load on the power supply varies so the real answer is not as easy. Suffice it to say though that the size of your electrical bill depends mainly on the components inside the computer and hardly on the Wattage of the PSU. 

The reason for not wanting a 1000W power supply when only using 500W is however one of efficiency. The lower the load on a power supply the worse the efficiency gets so it is still important for your electrical bill not to use a PSU with a huge overcapacity.

__________________________________

**Efficiency, Supply and Demand explained**

Until the arrival of the 80 PLUS bronze, silver and gold power supplies most PSUs had an efficiency of around 70%. What this means is that from the power going in to the power supply from your wall socket about 30% is converted in to heat (or: 30% of that energy is lost) and 70% of that power is converted in to power that can be used by the components in your computer.

A 500W power supply can **supply** 500W of power to your components. If this power supply is 70% efficient this means that it would draw about (500 / 70) x 100 = 714W from your wall socket if it's under full load. Even if you are not particularly environmentally conscious it is still a good idea to buy an 80 PLUS power supply because at these power loads your wallet will thank you.

**A word of caution on Power Supply Ratings**

There is no official rating for power supplies. Therefore the Wattage of a PSU is rated by the manufacturer. This is part of the reason you see a lot of people with severe overcapacity on their power supplies. Some power supplies labeled 500W can deliver a peak Wattage of 500W while other power supplies labeled 500W can deliver 500W ***continuously***. The higher tier brands tend to specify the continuous power while some of the lower end power supplies are labeled with their peak Wattage. In addition, some brands have their PSUs made by various OEM factories while other brands manufacture the power supplies themselves. This is the reason that with some brands only certain models are good power supplies while other models have a relatively high fail rate. 

_____________________

**Non OEM brands**

Two top brands that are also manufacturers are SeaSonic and Enermax. These power supplies are made using high-grade components and carry their continuous rated Wattage on the label. Due to the high-grade components and usage of the continuous Wattage these power supplies may **appear** to be less value for money but in reality they are usually among the top value for money offerings. A 650W SeaSonic unit is often a better choice than an 800W unit from a lesser brand. More expensive power supplies usually also have more extensive failsafe measures in place and are thus safer for the expensive components inside your PC.

We'll close of these series of posts with a list of /r/gamingpc recommended PSU brands and models.

There's ***a lot*** more to know about PSUs. In fact, we've only just scratched the surface so the story will continue later this week!

* Spamming (very few). Needless crossposting constitutes spamming.
* Rude behavior, bad language, bickering, or bad manners (most)

There are no people on the list for **any** other reason than the above. Being ""right"" or ""technically skilled"" or ""extremely intelligent"" is not acceptable compensation for lack of social grace. You have been banned for bad manners. 

Banning is not a powertrip. It's purpose is to keep you from poisoning the atmosphere in our little corner of the internet. Nobody wants or needs power over you. We know this is hard to believe, but you are nowhere near interesting enough for us to want anything to do with you.

____
____

**Q:** I don't know why I was banned.

**A:** This is not a question. This statement holds the answer you were probably looking for. If you don't read the rules you won't understand why you were banned.

______

**Q:** Your rules did not exactly match what I did.

**A:** We wrote these rules and we interpret them. You did not bother to ask for clarification.
______

**Q:** I did not mean my comment the way you interpreted it.

**A:** Not a question either. The answer you are most likely looking for is simple though, don't walk the line between acceptable and unacceptable.

______

**Q:** This subreddit should not be the way it is.

**A:** 7,700+ people disagree with you. By the way, that was not a question. Also, the beautiful thing of reddit is that setting up your own subreddit and running it differently is always less than 4 mouseclicks away.
______

**Q:** FU

**A:** Not a question. Have a nice day.
______

**Q:** The OP was throwing away his money.

**A:** Not a question. And probably not the answer that OP was looking for.
______

**Q:** Nobody needs the brutal hardware OP is considering.

**A:** Not a q... ow f... it. Did OP ask you what he needed or tell you what he wanted? Did OP ask you to tell him why he doesn't need a good videocard or did he/she simply asked if the components would work together? If you just want to hear yourself talk, PM yourself and don't bother other people.
______

**Q:** I know more than you do.

**A:** Not a question. If you think your unique skills are essential, set up a subreddit and watch your subscriber count exceed ours in minutes.

_____

**Q:** But I did not understand the rules!

**A:** What we want is an atmosphere where people feel comfortable discussing $100 on case lighting or $800 on a videocard. Where people can discuss $100 on a videocard if they want to. Where people are not made to feel bad about having money and splurging for some sexy hardware but also where people don't need to feel bad if they don't have the money.

**If people insist on making that impossible by requesting that we produce a flowchart, those people are missing the point either willingly (most likely) or because they refuse to take responsibility for what they do here.**

**Neither justification will be accepted.**

______

**Q:** Will I get unbanned?

**A:** [Every year at thanksgiving we will issue a single pardon.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Thanksgiving_Turkey_Presentation)

I was wondering for people running 680 SLI setups, how hot does cards get when they are this close, and does it make them louder? asking this specifically because most numbers in reviews have the cards a bit further apart (on newer mobos that have 2-slot gaps between PCI-Es)

also as an aside, anybody still running 680 SLI on x58? I have my i7 920 @ 3.67Ghz, running on a single 1440p monitor. I hope the cpu is not holding the cards back (a bit hard to find benches with 680 SLI on x58 nowadays... anandtech's recent article skipped the 920 as well)

thanks in advance"	t5_2sq2y	True

Please don't preach to me about the cons of using a wireless keyboard, *I know*. I'm already using an IR wireless keyboard with a very pitiful range, so whatever lag I may encounter, if any, I can adjust. However, my current setup is VERY inconvenienced by having a (essentially) wired keyboard and mouse, and it simply isn't cutting it anymore. Holidays are coming up, and I want to finally upgrade my accessories a bit.

All I want is a pretty much barebones wireless keyboard that has a range of about 5-10 feet, and has anti-ghosting. That's it. I don't need no fancy LED's or macros, I'm fairly casual. All I need is to get rid of these cables that stretch across the room, and for less than $70. I've done research, and I'm having trouble finding much, probably due to the fact that I don't really know a whole lot about keyboards. Any help is extremely appreciated, and I hope I didn't come off as being too dickish.

I ignored a bunch of mediocre reviews for the Thermaltake case because I liked the look of it. That was a mistake. The case isn't bad in any way. It's just not worth the price... 

The mounts for the h100 are not square. It seems to be a common complaint but I didn't see it until after I'd been bitten by it. If I'd known... I dunno. I'd have probably ended up with an air cooler. 

OMFG. It's so fast. I haven't even begun to tune it, and it's ... fast.

I can run The Witcher 2 in Ultra on a 6020x1080 3D Surround desktop at 60fps. I can run Deus Ex HR and Witcher 2 in 1920x1080 windows at the same time at 60+ fps. 

I can detonate 36,616 blocks of TNT on a bukkit 1.1-R6 server with 8g of ram, not drop any clients, and resolve the entire detonation in less than 4 minutes.  

Portal 2 in 3D is insanely good. 

Marvel Super Hero Squad Online in 3D is insanely good, too. (My kid loves it and honestly, I do too.)

I'd pay $49.95 for a utility that let me swap quickly between a multi-desktop display and the surround desktop. This is a long standing request for Nvidia, and it seems silly that they don't. I'll end up writing it myself if I don't find one eventually.

Overclocking Basics - Part 4: Overclocking the GPU
---------------------------------------------------------

**The GPU**

Here's where it gets a little murky unfortunately. We all know there are two major GPU companies out there at the moment. While this is good for everybody because it lowers prices and speeds up performance gains, NVidia and AMD are very different architectures. Different architectures behave differently when you start playing with clockspeeds. To make matters worse, both designs are incredibly complicated. Furthermore, the amount of calculations per second that's being done on a GPU is positively mind-boggling. Take for example one of the most popular cards at the moment: the NVidia GTX 560 Ti. This card is capable of 1263.4 GFLOPS. This means it can perform 1263.4 BILLION calculations per second. Just a few years ago this was only possible on supercomputers.
Please take a moment to try to wrap your head around that before you start torturing your GPU :-)

**The video memory**

Here we run in to a second roadblock for overclockers. While the architecture of GDDR5 memory is not exactly secret, it is quite a bit more complicated than the computer's main memory. As you'll recall I stayed clear of completely explaining how the main memory works. I'll have to do the same here because explaining this won't get you anywhere and it'd take an article that's quite a bit longer than these tutorials allow for ;-) The real roadblock here though is that although you know there's GDDR5 memory on your videocard, you don't know what brand and specifications it has. These can differ from card model to card model. So, not much help there either.

**The bottom line**

First off, the warning (yes, I have to, sorry...) **Overclocking can damage your videocard and possibly other components and you may not be able to get away with using your warranty. Probably even less so than when overclocking the CPU! GPUs run very very hot! Mine went up all the way to 100C on stock clocks when testing! You need to really watch the temperatures when you start doing this and have your heart medicine at the ready. Proceed at your own risk!**

Have I discouraged you yet? If you're still here, below is what I do when overclocking a videocard. Before you proceed, also try to find what the maximum allowed temperature for your GPU is. That's not always easy to find but if you can, do find it.

* Start with the GPU clock. Increase this clock a tiny bit at a time, say 10MHz each step.

* After upping the GPU clock with a small step, start your favorite monitoring application for the temperatures. A free application that can do this is [TechPowerUp GPU-Z]( http://www.techpowerup.com/downloads/2018/TechPowerUp_GPU-Z_v0.5.4.html). You'll find the GPU sensors including the temperature on the second tab once you fire it up.

* When you have your monitor program (GPU-Z) running, start the FurMark benchmarking and testing tool. It can be downloaded for free here:  [Geeks3D FurMark v1.9.1]( http://www.geeks3d.com/20110628/furmark-1-9-1-furmark-1-8-5-download-gpu-stress-test-burn-in-graphics-card-opengl/)

* In Furmark, keep Fullscreen unchecked, select 1280x720 Resolution, 8x MSAA Alti-aliasing, Dynamic Background  &amp; Dynamic camera. This will heat up your GPU considerably!!! Heed the warning that the program gives you and remember you can wreck your GPU if you push it too hard or if you have bad luck.

* With the settings done click [BURN-IN test]. It will start testing in windowed mode so you can keep an eye on your GPU temperatures. My GPU can go up to 100C according to NVidia specs but to be honest I don't feel comfortable with that much heat. Here's where gut-feeling comes in, unfortunately. Personally I only feel slightly comfortable with under 90C and comfortable with under 80C but there's no rules for gut-feeling.

* See how much your temperatures shoot up. If you start to feel uncomfortable with it, stop the test and go no further.

* If it appears stable you can stop the BURN-IN. I usually don't let it run longer than 2 minutes.

* **Extra step for stability testing inserted here! Before proceeding it's wise to at least check your GPU stability (rendering test) with OCCT. OCCT is discussed in [Part 6 here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/jonvr/article_overclocking_basics_part_6_tools_for/).**

* This time in FurMark, click the [Benchmark Preset: 720] Button. A fullscreen benchmark test will run for 1 minute. When it finishes your screen will go black for a second and then you will be returned to your desktop. FurMark will now have opened a pop-up window that shows your FurMark Score. Write this down.
Repeat the above steps (increase clock, run FurMark twice) until you start seeing diminishing returns from overclocking further (your benchmark score won't grow as much with 10MHz clock increase anymore). 

**At any time during BURN-IN or benchmark your computer may freeze!!! When it does, press the reset button quickly and revert to the previous clock setting (after reboot). You'll have found your GPU limit!! If the computer doesn't freeze but you start seeing strange screen artifacts during either BURN-IN or benchmark, stop the test immediately!! In the fullscreen you can press Esc to stop it.**

Once you have found your stable maximum clock setting, start gaming for at least a few hours to see if your system is still stable during prolonged high load. 

**If the game freezes or crashes, also press the Reset button immediately! When rebooted reduce your overclock further and repeat.**

*I realize we've not gotten to the videoram part yet but this story is getting long so I'll put up some pointers on the memory clock in the next post.*

**One more warning, sorry for the repetitive warnings. This can damage your videocard and possibly other components! Do this at your own risk!**

**Questions, suggestions, comments &amp; corrections welcome!**

I have been a big fan of the Lightning series from MSI back when the GTX 480 Lightning was released. Their Twin Frozr coolers helped achieve the massive overclocking potential of the cards, and if you went H20 or LN2, your ceiling suddenly got a lot higher. When the 600 series first arrived on scene I waited patiently for the Lightning to release all the while still chugging along nicely with my 580 Lightnings. I've had the 680 Lightning for over a week and a half, and after constantly tweaking and retweaking, I finally feel I've gotten a good idea what it's capable of. Here's an overview of the card and what you can expect should you buy one.

**Price** - The card comes in at $599 which is pretty steep for a 680, let alone any graphic card. The premium price nets you a plethora of features not found on many other 680. Custom cooler &amp; PCB, voltage control, dual-bios,  backplate, voltage checkpoints and [MSI's unique GPU reactor.](http://imgur.com/Gt4yp) Standard fare is 2GB of VRAM, and a slightly higher than usual factory overclock of 1110 Mhz that boostclocks to 1167. 


**Cooler &amp; Temps** - MSI's Twin Frozr IV cooler is hands down one of the best I've even seen. Dual 100mm fans keeps this card cool, even under serious overclock. As I type this, even with extra voltage to keep the overclock stable, it idles at 28c, with the fan running at 30%. Quiet and cool. Further, its startup fan reversal helps prevent dust from accumulating in the heatsink, though I'll see how effective this truly is in time. When it does this, the fans run in reverse at 100% for 30 seconds on startup, which gets pretty loud. Under load while gaming(not stress testing or benchmarking) I never saw the 680 Lightning exceed 58 celsius. In Battlefield 3, it topped out at 53 celsius.  With Kombustor's GPU burn in, it leveled off at 68c with the fans manually locked in at 60%. The fans were inaudible at 58% and lower, and got noisy at 70% and higher.


**Overclocking &amp; Voltage** - The Lightning take two 8 pin PCI Express power connectors. The biggest trick up the 680 Lightning's sleeve is its ability to deliver more voltage than every other 680 with exception of the EVGA's 680 Classified with EVbot. With the 3 voltage checkpoints, you can monitor GPU, memory, and PLL voltage with a multimeter. From factory the Lightning kicks out a maximum of 1.212v bypassing the nVidia cap of 1.175. This is achieved via the secondary LN2 BIOS. The primary intent of this BIOS is to allow for liquid nitrogen cooling, however is it is also designed for high overclocking on air/water, and as such provides a number of benefits:


* Increases voltage cap

* Removes auto underclocking when card reaches 70c

* Removes software and hardware safeguards for stabile high overclocking

* Removes -0c errors when LN2 cooling.


With the LN2 BIOS I was able to achieve a boostclock of 1305 Mhz. I believe I can get higher. Other users were able to achieve peak boostclock of 1375Mhz. I also found that overclocks that were achievable in the original BIOS were more stable in the LN2 BIOS. MSI has announced that Afterburner 2.2.3 will allow the Lightning to surpass the 1.212v cap which should allow for an even higher boostclock. At the time of this review, the 2.2.3 version has not yet been released.


[The GPU reactor] (http://i.imgur.com/kJ0Ynh.jpg) fits on the back of the card and is supposed to reduce voltage ripple while increasing the overclocking headroom. Personally, I can't vouch for its usage as I've seen no immediate benefit from it, and MSI has stated that it can be removed should it get in the way of SLI(which it will if you're SLIing the cards side by side). On the plus side it glows blue and blends in nicely with my blue fan scheme. :)

[Without reactor board](http://i.imgur.com/bdO03h.jpg)

**Benchmarks** -  I conducted benchmarks with and without 1305 Mhz overclock due to the fluctuating binning on the Lightnings. Not everyone will be able to achieve 1300+ Mhz. 

[Benchmark graphs]( http://imgur.com/3iO6T)


&gt;Settings

Battlefield 3  - 1920x1080/Ultra settings/ 4x MSAA/ Motion blur off

Batman Arkham City - 1920x1080/Details: Very High/8x MSAA/Tessellation: High

Metro 2033 - 1920x1080/Very High Quality/4x MSAA/DOF off

&gt;All testing was conducted with 304.79 drivers

**Conclusion** - I've always been a sucker for the Lightning series so it comes as no surprise that I feel the 680 Lightning is the best one yet. It runs fantastically cool, and its overclocking potential is phenomenal. I have yet to reach what I believe is its max ability. Further, if the 2.2.3 version of Afterburner allows it to surpass 1.212v, then this card has the ability to smash everything in its path.  [Xoleras on Overclock.net was able to get over 24000 SLI GPU score in 3DMark11.]( http://3dmark.com/3dm11/3772300) 
If you want absolutely the best in synthetic benchmarks, and the ability to overclock well past the capability of other cards, all the while keeping the card frosty, quiet, and stable, the GTX 680 Lightning is hands down a great choice. If however, budget is on your top list of priorities, I cannot recommend the 680 Lightning. It is designed for the extreme overclocker in mind, not to be light on your wallet.

**Tl;DR The GTX680 Lightning from MSI is one powerhouse of a card that can produce stunning results but most of its features are too costly for the standard user.**

The mod wasnt too hard at all. The longest part was making sure all the measurements i did were correct. Cutting the case was done with a dremel with a ez-lock cutting circle. Of course the screws that came with the rads were unusable to top mount the 360. Had to purchase some 30mm screws. 
*****
The EK 280 rad barely fits into place. There is absolutely no clearance between the bottom of the cdrom trays and the top of the rad. I have it secured by screwing through the original cases vertical support panels directly in front of the rad. Doing this allowed me to keep the 2 front original 140mm fans and run a push/pull setup on them.
******
Had to go with a low profile rad in the top of the case due to clearance issues with the ram slots. I could have shifted the rad closer to the side but then it wouldnt look good with an off center rad grill up top. I currently run the 120mm pwm fans at 40% to keep them silent. Once my cpu temps reaches 40 degrees under load the fans crank up to compensate. Idle temps are bit higher due to this but it is worth it in my opinion.
******
The tubing looks red in the pictures due to the flash. In person they are very close to the same color as the fans.

*****

Currently overclocked to 4.5ghz@ 1.315 Vcore on a 2500k cpu. Idle temps are around 30-33 celsius. GPU temps idle at 25 C. With GPU and CPU load at 100% running prime95 blend and msi kombuster temps reach 50 celsius(cpu) and 33(gpu). Ambient air temp is 22 C.

Alright, let's continue with the PCI express graphics power connectors as promised in the previous post. These are often called PEG power connectors so I'll refer to them by this abbreviation.

______________

**PEG power connectors**

As was explained in the previous post there is a current limit **per wire** for any leads running from the power supply to the mainboard or other devices. This is the reason that some graphics cards have a single 6 pin power connection, some have dual 6 pin power connections, a few have one 6 pin and one 8 pin and extreme cards like the GTX 590 and HD6990 have dual 8 pin connectors.

The difference between the 6 pin and 8 pin power connectors is easy but also important:

* A 6 pin PEG connector can deliver 75W of 12V power to the graphics card.

* An 8 pin PEG connector can deliver 150W of 12V power to the graphics card.

* There is a [6+2 pin PEG](http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/pcie6plus2index.jpg) hybrid connector as well. Since this allows you to plug it into an 8-pin socket that cable should be able to deliver 150W, otherwise the power supply would not come with this cable!!!

Additionally, the PCI express slot itself can deliver 75W of power to the graphics card.

____________________

**6+2 pin fairytales**

Remember, ratings ultimately determine how much current **can** safely flow through a particular electrical connection. How much it **can take** is not the same as how much current **will actually flow** though that connection. Therefore with the 6+2 wire connecting it to a 6-pin socket won't overload anything. The socket will simply pull a theoretical maximum of 75W from this plug while the plug can provide a theoretical maximum of 150W.

_________________

Knowing what power connectors are on your graphics card makes it easy to determine what kind of Wattage your PSU must be able to deliver to the graphics card alone:

* A GTX 560 with dual 6 pin connectors is allowed to draw a theoretical maximum of 75W (slot) + 75W (6-pin) + 75W (6-pin) = 225W from the power supply. This means you have to allocate 225W for the graphics card alone, on top of all the other stuff that is in your system. For dual cards you thus have to have 450W of power allotted for graphics. It's important however to also look up the specifications of your card. According to NVidia specifications the [GTX 560]( http://www.geforce.com/Hardware/GPUs/geforce-gtx-560/specifications) draws a maximum of 150W, not 225W. This makes sense because maxing out the power lines running to your card (although theoretically allowed) is generally not considered good practice from an engineering point of view. The slightly more powerful [GTX 560 Ti]( http://www.geforce.com/Hardware/GPUs/geforce-gtx-560ti/specifications) draws another 20 Watts (170W) so it also totals well within the 225W the cables and slot can carry.

* A GTX 580 which has one 6 pin and one 8 pin PEG connector can thus draw a theoretical maximum of 75W (slot) + 75W (6-pin) + 150W (8-pin) = 300W from the power supply. A quick look at the [GTX 580 specifications]( http://www.geforce.com/Hardware/GPUs/geforce-gtx-580/specifications) shows that in reality the GTX 580 draws a maximum of 244W total so this is again well within the allotted 300W.

____________

**Custom cards vs. reference cards**

Various graphics card designers have boards of their own design as well as factory overclocked GPUs on these boards. The power your graphics card consumes can therefore differ from the reference power requirements that are mentioned in the examples. The specificied Wattage of the slot, 6-pin and 8-pin power connections does not change however so the theoretical maximum for a card is always easy to determine by which power connections are on the card.

__________

**Native PEG connectors**

If a power supply natively supplies the correct power connections for a graphics card, connecting it is obviously a no-brainer. Remember however that a power supply also has to be able to power the rest of your system! I was able to put my system together on experience and took 300W for mainboard, CPU and other components (Phenom II X6 3.7GHz, some harddisks, fans, lighting, etc.), added the theoretical maximum of 300W for my dual GTX 560s adding up to a total of 600W. 

___________

**Reality check**

My power supply is a Corsair HX650 which is rated to deliver 650W **continuously** up to an ambient temperature of 50C. Measurements during gaming showed it pulled 522W peak from the wall socket. Taking into account the 80% efficiency of my PSU that means the components were actually drawing just 522W * 0.80 = 418W. All in all my system is balanced: it's well within the theoretical maximum power draw and gaming usage still leaves a margin of a pretty massive 650 - 418 = 232W!

________________

**Don't gamble!**

Taking a 300W baseline usage is probably enough for most systems out there although for an overclocked 8-core Bulldozer system you'll probably want to take a considerably higher margin. Be aware though that even these power-hungry systems are only power-hungry if you stress them to full load. Normal webbrowsing, gaming or watching a video will most likely keep them under the 300W baseline as well. You do need to account for the headroom however, you wouldn't want your PSU to shut down if you encode a video ;-)

___________

**Check against multiple sources**

Don't start calculating just yet though, there are more fool-proof ways than taking a default baseline of 300W and even if you do, you should check your outcomes against a PSU calculator. There are more and more of these out there and once we've discussed actual knowledge I'll point you to a few!

____________________

**Rails, limitations and more**

Talk about your PSU shutting your system down brings us to a topic that probably a lot of you have been waiting for: rails, overcurrent and overcurrent protection. I mention these in one sentence because they are intimately tied together. All of them have to do with the maximum current (Amperes) that your components are allowed to pull from your PSU or part of your PSU (rails). I'm sorry to have to disappoint for now but I'm reaching reddit's post size limitation... Rails, currents and safeguards in the next post!! This will also bring us to the molex-to-PEG converter cables and what to watch out for!

Okay, let's move on to the next common considerations when it comes to selecting power supplies.

___________

**Modular vs. non-modular**

A lot of us are concerned with cable management when building a PC. Modular power supplies make for a cleaner looking inside of your computer case and many make the argument for improved airflow. While both are certainly worth consideration, the more important argument when you want to build a stable system is the quality of the power supply! 

If you have the choice within your budget between a high quality non-modular versus a lesser quality modular, the high quality is the superior choice without exception! Even non-modular power supplies allow you to tuck away cables, provided that you have a case with good cable management facilities! Most cases with a bottom mounted PSU make this very easy, you can simply route the cables you are not using behind the motherboard tray and they disappear out of sight after only about 3 or 4 inches. 

This does not impede airflow whatsoever and is almost equally clean looking. When it comes to cable management the case is the deciding factor every time!

___________

**Cable length**

An often overlooked property that is also more important than modular is the length of the cables. If the cables running from your PSU are too short it's going to be impossible to route them in such a way that you end up with a clean look, modular and non-modular alike in this case. 

Additionally, if you're going for a full-tower case with a bottom mounted PSU you run the risk of your cables not being able to reach their destinations at all, regardless of how you route them. 

_____________

**Available connectors**

Much more important than the modular vs. non-modular debate is the availability of certain power connectors on your PSU, whether that be pre-mounted cables or not. 

Your motherboard connector is obviously going to be there. This will either be a [24-pin connector](http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/main24index.jpg) or a [20+4 connector](http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/main20plus4index.jpg). If you are using a really old motherboard you'd need the 20+4 but in most cases either will do just fine.  Expensive power supplies tend to have the 20+4 so they can cater to any eventuality. On to the other variables:

* Main board CPU power. This connector routes additional 12 volt power to your mainboard. Your mainboard will have either a 4-pin ATX12V power socket or  an 8-pin EPS12V socket. Cheaper and older power supplies tend to have the [4-pin ATX12V connector](http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/12v4pinindex.jpg), some will have the [8-pin EPS12V]( http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/eps8pinindex.jpg) connector. Modern power supplies and especially high-quality ones tend to have a [4+4 CPU power connector]( http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/eps4plus4index.jpg) so they can cater to either mainboard power socket. The difference between 4-pin and 8-pin is not as critical as most people think. In fact all the +12V wires usually connect to the same place as do all the ground wires, whether that be 8 x +12V and 8x GND or 4x +12V and 4x GND. The reason for 8 wires is that there is a rating for the Amperage that is allowed to flow *per wire*. 8 wires get less hot on high current than 4. If the PSU has 8 wires for this you can be sure that it can deliver enough Amperage **safely** for 8 pin mainboards.

* The well-known [SATA power connectors](http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/sataindex.jpg) and [Molex power connectors]( http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/peripheralindex.jpg). For the most part, all you need to look for here is if you have enough of either variety. Molex power connectors can be converted into SATA power connectors but there is **one caveat:** officially a SATA power connector also has a 3.3V line. Molex connectors do not provide 3.3V [(the orange wire)](http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/sataindex.jpg) so the Molex to SATA converter cables that come with some harddisks, PSUs and mainboard do not cater to the full SATA power specification! This is generally not a problem though because almost no harddisks that I know of need that 3.3V. Officially however, **they are allowed to require this**.

* [6 pin PCI express graphics power connectors (PEG)](http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/pcie6index.jpg), [8 pin PEG power connectors](http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/pcie8index.jpg) and [6+2 pin PEG power connectors](http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/pcie6plus2index.jpg). Like with the 8 vs 4 pin CPU power connectors the difference here has to do with the Amperage that can be safely delivered that is related to the number of wires. Like with those mainboard connectors, the +12V wires (yellow) generally go to the same place and so do the GND wires (black). Amperages on videocards get way higher than they do on the mainboard CPU +12V though so I'll be going into this in more detail in the next post (sorry, running out of space in this post!).

**To be continued in part 3: PCI express power requirements.**

_________________________________________________________

Okay, now that we've talked a little about multicore, let's move on to multi GPU setups. I'm not going to talk about different rendering modes for now but I want to tackle something that comes up frequently when talking about multi graphics card solutions: the dual cards at x16/x16 or x8/x8 discussion.
There's lots of tests floating around, some of which point to there being no performance difference between the 2 configurations, others measure 3-5% improvement in the faster x16/x16 setup while others yet measure 10-20%. All of these are probably correct. To understand why this is we have to talk about available bandwidth and required bandwidth.
___________________________________________________________

**Bandwidth**

Everybody here has probably heard the magic word 'bandwidth' on a lot of occasions. As a computer and software engineer I've seen it used and most of the time also abused, especially by people in the gaming community.
What is bandwidth exactly? To put it simply it's the amount of **traffic per second** that a connection between 2 components can sustain. The simplest analogy would be to a highway. The amount of cars that can travel over the highway in a specified amount of time depends on 2 things:

* The maximum speed the cars are allowed to travel and;

* The number of lanes the highway provides.

Also take note of the fact that on a highway there's lanes in both directions. For the purpose of this discussion we'll consider a highway with one lane in either direction (2 total) to be a 1-lane connection because we're concerned with the maximum traffic per second from point A to point B. We can't exactly use the other lane to get there as those who tried can no longer tell you ;-)

A PCI slot is basically exactly the same: 

* x16 means that there are 16 traffic lanes running to the graphics card. Coincidentally in PCI express terms these are also called lanes! A single PCI express lane consists of an upstream (toward the graphics card) and a downstream connection. Both are equally fast but the only one that really needs to be is the one that's running toward the graphics card; most of the data that's exchanced between the graphics cards flows toward the card. (Not when you're using the GPU for other things than graphics but this is a gaming subreddit so we'll leave that out for clarity.)

* x8 as you'll have surmised by now means that there are 8 traffic lanes flowing toward the graphics card.

The maximum speed traffic can possibly flow over one of these lanes is determined by the PCI express version number:

* PCI express 1.0 has a speed of 250 MB (Mega **Bytes**) per second (= 0.25 GB/s).

* PCI express 2.0 has a speed of 500 MB/s (= 0.5 GB/s)

* PCI express 3.0 has a speed of 1000 MB/s (= 1GB/s)

This is one of the reasons that test results vary so much between different tests although it's not the only reason by a longshot. It is the cause however for some differences:

* A  single 16 lane PCI express 1.0 graphics card can receive 4GB/s of data,

* A single 8 lane PCI express 2.0 graphics card can receive...... 4GB/s of data!

So when PCI express 2.0 arrived, the need for 16 lanes was temporarily alleviated. With the up and coming PCI express 3.0 this need will again be temporarily alleviated **however** bear in mind that you will need PCI express 3.0 graphics cards to make this work! Your current PCI express 2.0 graphics cards will work in a 3.0 slot but they will do so at 2.0 speeds!

________________________________________________________________

There are **important other factors** in play that determine whether you need (or would want) a 16 lane connection to your graphics card:

* The size of the 3D worlds in a particular game

* The size of your videomemory (per card)

I recently saw a review posted in /r/buildapc that made a comparison with dual GTX 580 cards in a x16 / x16 setup vs. a x8 / x8 setup.

The **stupidity** of this test prompted me to address the PCI express issue today rather than tomorrow (it was planned for tomorrow). [Here is the post I'm referring to so you can check it out.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/kmwdo/difference_between_x16_and_x8_for_sli_explained/)

There are a couple of things wrong with this test:

The test is done with 3DMark 11. The worlds that are rendered in this benchmark easily fit in to the memory of a GTX 580. This means that once the data is transferred to the graphics card it can render a million frames with it without having to do massive amounts of data transfer from the main memory to the graphics card. This uses the x8 (or x16) link only once for a million frames. **3D worlds in upcoming games are much larger and require transfers of data while rendering a frame!**

**In other words, the performance difference between x8 / x8 and x16 / x16 depends ENTIRELY on what you are doing with the cards!!!**

*This is by no means the end of this story but given the post mentioned above I decided to push out the first part ahead of time. Part 4 of the series will follow shortly, continuing on the PCI express discussion.*

LiarInGlass	37	4	28	"I've been a long time reader and member of Overclock.net, and came across [""The Mod""](http://www.overclock.net/t/1203528/official-nvidia-gpu-mod-club-aka-the-mod), a quick and easy mod for using a CLC (Closed Liquid Cooler) like an Antec 620, 920, or Corsair H50/H60/H70 on a GPU instead of CPU like intended. I haven't seen a lot of people doing this around here, but I thought I'd show it off and express how pleased I am with the results. My gaming PC is now much more amazing to me and I love it.

With stock cooling, my GTX 480 at stock voltage and a very small overclock would idle at around 55-60C, and would hit above 85-90C under full load when running OCCT or other benchmarking applications.

After applying the Antec 620, with a decent location for the radiator and the fans, it's now heavily overclocked to 900/1800/2200 at 1.163 volts and idles between 33-35C and hits about 60C under full load. That's a pretty huge difference for me, and I no longer have to hear the extremely loud and annoying fan from the 480. I just keep the fan at 30% at all times to help keep the VRM cooled.

I didn't have much room to work with since my machine is a little old now, and I hate this case, so I try not to mess with it too much. I just have the radiator near the middle/front with a push/pull configuration, and I leave my side panel off.

The mod took a bit of time, but it was definitely worth it. All that was needed was the Antec 920, zip ties, thermal paste, and some patience.

I used four zip ties to connect around the Antec 920 and tightened them a bit, and then fed 4 through the ring of zip ties I made, then looped them and fed them through the holes of the 480 PCB, and then fastened them down tightly.

I hope some more people around here give this a try, as the temperature is pretty awesome. I don't think it's as good as a real water system, but it's definitely better than fan cooling and using stock coolers or it even seems better than the aftermarket coolers that I've seen.

Here's a few shots I took of the process.

[Rad placement in my two year old machine.](http://i.imgur.com/lUnB8.jpg)

All in all, I think it was a really awesome experiment and I'm pleased with a fairly silent GPU now and got to take advantage of a pretty high overclock compared to stock. I wish I could get it higher, but I seem to not be able to get any higher. It's still good enough for me.

Hope some others around here try this out if you haven't seen it. It's pretty awesome and simple.

I bought a Kill-A-Watt unit, which is pretty cool in that it not only displays wattage, but also fun stuff like voltage, current, and frequency so you can see if you're getting good, clean electrons. So, without further ado...  

 **The Setup:**  

 * CPU: i5 2500k @ 4.8 GHz
 * GPU: GTX 580 @ 931 Core, 1862 Shader, 2053 Memory (all in MHz)
 * GPU2: GT 520 @ stock
 * MEMORY: 2 DDR3 1.5v DIMMs @ 1600MHz, 8-8-8-24 (XMP)
 * SOUND: Asus Xonar STX PCI-E x1
 * FANS: 7x AeroCool Shark 120mm 12v (~3A each) at full blast
 * WATER PUMP: Swiftech MP-655 12v (not sure of the amperage)
 * PSU: Corsair HX 850  

 **The Test:**  
Prime95 Blend test, made sure CPU was at 100%.  MSI Kombustor (furmark) full settings, full screen, made sure both GPUs were at 100% (or at least flickering between 98-100). Foobar2000 blasting tunes through the sound card (with onboard headphone amp, requires additional +12V +5V molex).  

 **The Results:**
Let everything run for 5 minutes and observed the wattage (1 Hz refresh).  The maximum wattage observed was 451 watts. Four hundred and fifty one, for those of you counting along at home.  That's with a case full of overclocked (and slightly increased VCore) parts.  I'm not guaranteeing any results, and I can't be 100% sure that my Kill-a-watt unit is calibrated to the stated +/- 1% tolerance, but I think this result speaks volumes in terms of what the general consensus is.  


As a humorous side note, when I was paying for the Kill-a-watt, the Radio Shack guy asked me what I intended to use it for. I told him it was for my computer, and after giving him an overview of my system he said (and I quote) ""Hah, probably gonna be at least 1200W."" Even after I told him I was using an 850W PSU....

Overclocking Basics - Part 10: Overclocking the reference clock (hands-on)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Remember: overclocking / overvolting can damage system components and may limit or even void your warranty. Proceed at your own risk!**

**Intel users**

_____________________________________________________________

Since overclocking newer intel CPUs using the reference clock is severely limited at best and I don't have access to a 1366 system, this article focuses on AMD systems.

**Software!**

_____________________________________________________________

As promised earlier, I have written you a little software program that instantly calculates how clocks and timings change if you change the reference clock. I've named it 'OverCalc' and it can be downloaded here: 

* [**OverCalc v1.4**](http://www.filefactory.com/file/cd63660/n/OverCalc_v1.4.exe) (should be working now!)

* [New Online scan](http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=685e2acaabd6cabce6027b82e01a993a4e188a0298da8cb51078258cc51cbc13-1314948278).

* OverCalc requires Microsoft.NET 4.0 to run. You can download the latest version at Microsoft here: [.NET 4.0](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17851)

This program will calculate the resulting clocks when you change the reference clock or any of the multipliers. It will also attempt to calculate appropriate timings for your RAM.

This program does not change any system settings, it simply calculates viable settings that you can try out by entering them into the BIOS. 

**First off: enter your factory RAM timings**

_____________________________________________________________

To get started you need to fill out your RAM's factory specifications in the top right corner. In the dropdown box you can select the datarate of the RAM that is in your system (DDR3 1333 / 1600 / 1866 / 2000 / 2133). Under the dropdown box you can specify your RAM's timings. They are organized in the usual way: CAS- tRCD - tRP - tRAS (e.g. 9-9-9-24). Once you have specified what RAM is in your system, the program can calculate the actual timings of your RAM in nanoseconds.

As you may remember from the previous articles, your DRAM timings are measured in clockcycles, so in the above example the CAS latency of the RAM is 9 *clockcycles*. Given that the example RAM has a datarate of 1600 and thus a factory clockspeed of 800MHz the program can now calculate how many seconds 1 clockcycle takes (1 / 800millionth of a second) and multiply this by the number of CAS cycles.

The result of this calculation appear to the right of the CAS setting, measured in nanoseconds (1 / 800 millionth of a second in nanoseconds is ((1 / 800 million) x 1 billion) = 1.25 nanoseconds. Multiplied by 9 cycles for CAS this gets us 9 x 1.25 = 11.25ns.

The same calculations are done for tTCD, tRP, and tRAS. Once you have entered the specifications of your RAM you can leave that section alone and start playing with the reference clock and the multipliers.

**Secondly, start adjusting the base clock and multipliers to find a likely stable setting**

_____________________________________________________________

Now that the program knows your factory RAM timings, we can adjust the reference clock and try to find an optimal setting for both the base clock and the multipliers.

Keep in mind that we can get good results by actually lowering some or all of the multipliers!

As an example I will tune down the DRAM multiplier (in the left groupbox, remember, the official specs in the right don't change!) to 1333 and then start upping the reference clock.

As I get to a value of 214MHz we now see something interesting happening in the bottom grid that is filled with possible timings. As a reference, [here is what my screen looks like now](http://i.imgur.com/JldaN.png). 

The fields that are highlighted green are timings that should work with your base clock and DRAM multiplier (*should* means decent chance here, because we are running outside of specification, your RAM might still not like it). 

Also bear in mind that even though it **appears** we are using slower timings on the RAM, in reality we aren't. 10 clockcycles at 890MHz ram clock is almost exactly as long as 9 clockcycles with a RAM clock of 800MHz but the RAM's **datarate** will be significantly higher at 890MHz (1780 datarate vs. 1600 datarate).

Values that are faster than specification but only slightly are marked yellow. So with this DRAM multiplier (1333) and a reference clock of 214MHz we can basically try 2 timing settings for the memory: 9-9-9-22 (using only the green values) or 8-8-8-22 (using the faster yellow values where available).

If values are further out of spec (too fast) they are displayed in red, if the are out of spec on the slow side, the are displayed in blue (no real reason to go slower, but interesting to see how the values play out).

You will also notice that when you up the reference clock that obviously your processor and HT link speeds will go up considerably.

If I increase the reference clock even further, to 240MHz another interesting thing happens!  Here's [what my screen looks like now]( http://i.imgur.com/dnPbk.png).

Now my RAM is totally back at it's reference speed (800MHz DDR3 1600) while the multiplier is set at the value for DDR3-1333. My processor is now obviously clocked higher than before and so is the HT link speed (now 2400MHz). This might be too fast for the HT link, so we can set it's multiplier back from x10 to x9. Now we have RAM on stock 1600 but we have an overclocked HT link! That should speed up some things in our system while most of it actually runs stock :-)

If we want to take things further, we could again up the baseclock now. When I do that and I reach 267MHz something interesting happens yet again! [Now it looks like this]( http://i.imgur.com/GBfo9.png)!

The RAM is now running at nearly 1800 data rate with the multiplier set only to 1333. We now have viable timing options for 10-10-10-27 (yellow) or 11-11-11-27 (green). Realistically this is a steep overclock for memory but then again, it might be worth a try, maybe it will run at a datarate of 1780...

I also notice now that my processor speed is way over 4GHz (4272MHz) so I might want to turn that down a tad. Turning down the CPU multiplier to x14.5 brings it down to a more realistic 3.87GHz. The HT multiplier is once again over the 2.4GHz mark so I tune that down a tad as well. Setting the HT to x8 brings it to 2136MHz, a bit closer to it's rated speed of 2000MHz. Now we have both overclocked RAM and and overclocked HT link! [This is how it looks now :-)]( http://i.imgur.com/HW7h8.png)

As you can see from the examples in the text above, overclocking using the reference clock usually involves setting the multipliers **lower**! Since CPUs with locked multipliers **do allow** us to lower the multipliers this is an overclocking strategy that allows locked CPUs to be overclocked as well! It also allows us to find settings that are in between the multiplier steps so we get a little more flexibility using this approach. 

If you look back at the design schematics for AMD systems that were discussed in the previous posts you'll notice that data transfers from the main memory to the video memory involve both the HT link speed and the memory speed so if these final settings happen to be stable we'll see a performance gain there.

**Stability testing and temperatures**

_____________________________________________________________

Since we now obviously have other stuff besides the processor overclocked, if you do stability testing also take care to observe the other temperatures on your system. By using programs like HWMonitor you can keep an eye on the other temperatures your mainboard is reporting. A faster running HT link will warm up your northbridge chip more so keep an eye on all temperatures during the stability test! 

Other than that, the same stability testing procedures apply that were discussed in earlier posts. The only difficulty now is that we can't know for sure which part is causing a problem when the stability tests report errors. Overclocked RAM can be to blame, but it's also possible that an overclocked HT link is throwing errors. If you've had your processor on the same speed or higher earlier that is ofcourse the least likely cause of any errors. 

I don't personally like going to the very extremes of what is still stable, I usually take a 10%-20% with a thank you and leave it at that. It is however obviously up to you how far you are willing to push your hardware and there is no guarantee you will even reach 10%. Always remember though, any changes to a system are done at your own risk and expense!!

But, I don't know what to cover. I have a lot of experience in general, but the internet's a big place and I'm not alone in my expertise.

So, I present to you, dear reader, topics that I think are worthwhile. You may notice that there's nothing particularly universal, but that's intended. Other people have documented great stuff and there's no need for me to go about repeating them.

Topics that I feel have weak coverage in general:

- Gaming in 3D with AMD. The software, how to configure, what's needed, etc.

- Overclocking the *reference* AMD 7970. Includes upping the voltage, flashing a more aggressive BIOS, and monitoring every little detail.

- IceDragon Nanofluid. Does it work? Is it worth it? (Hint: yes, no) Note: I don't have much data when I was using water; don't expect to leave convinced either way, the difference is very small.

- The Logitech G19. Just what the hell do you get for $200? WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT HAS RUBBER DOME KEYS?!?! WTF IS THIS SCREEN? AND MORE!

- Battery back-ups. Why you could be interested, why you may discover they're not for you.

- Cramming water in a 400r. My case and it's story. (rads: 30mm 2x120, 30mm 1x120, 35mm 2x120) Would include a little bit about fitting rads in general.

Topics that get mentioned a lot here (and I don't like other guides):

- Watercooling radiators in-depth. What are the differences, how much do I need, and wtf is fpi?

- Intel RST. Setting up SSD caching with Intel's high-end controller hubs.

This is limited to what I have hardware on hand to do and what I think is decently covered elsewhere.

So, any interest? If you're tempted to explore something directly related to what I'm willing to cover, do state this, I'll be much more inclined to cover it. (ie: I've always wanted to blow up my 7970! Cover that! I love sparks! VRM smoke? Best smoke!)"	t5_2sq2y	True

Hey everybody,

One of our valued contributors has generously offered to sponsor a game giveaway contest!

Since the subreddit is built around (among other things) the love for being different and original in building / designing you dream rig and making it your own unique creation, we've decided to hold a contest where the aim is to post your creation.

To qualify, use this thread to post the following:

* Pictures of your rig (including a note with your reddit name in the picture)
* The specifications

It doesn't have to be an expensive rig. I know we discuss a lot of high-end gear but the aim for this contest is to be original. Being different doesn't have to cost a lot of money.

We've decided to pick the winner at random because picking the winner on karma led to karma-wars that spoiled the fun for a lot of contestants and led to unfair practices.

May the person with the best real-life karma win! The prize: a game of your choosing from a list we've compiled (because ""within reason"" requires being reasonable and judging by the voting behavior, that does not apply to everybody).

We still love seeing your original builds and we'll be doing random draws from now on in future contests :-)

This has been adjusted with the latest rumors incorporated and memory bandwidth has been recalculated to match the memory frequency and bus width.

Obviously this is still rumor and by no means guaranteed to be accurate but combining all the sources this is my personal take on what it will probably look like.

Prices are based on the relative performance estimate compared to the current 6 series lineup. The new GCN architecture based cards will very likely come at an additional premium which I tried to estimate based on market value and enthusiast level pricing.

Overclocking Basics - Part 9: Overclocking the reference clock (or base clock)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Remember: overclocking / overvolting can damage system components. Proceed at your own risk!**

**Intel users**

Before you start reading it's worth noting that overclocking by using the base clock is nearly impossible on Sandy Bridge systems. Because modern AMD systems still offer an advantage through the base clock I will be discussing AMD only in this article. The article does explain why though, so if you're still interested read on :-)

**Components affected by the base clock **

In case you did not yet know the basic components on your motherboard and how they interconnect, [here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Motherboard_diagram.svg) is a diagram that will clarify how most components in a PC are wired to eachother, although there have been some changes recently. This diagram will however still help to clarify which components are affected by the reference clock and why. It will also serve to illustrate the recent changes discussed below. As you can see in the diagram the clock generator is clearly marked as a separate component. The signal this  clock generator creates is often referred to as the 'reference clock' or 'base clock'. On AMD systems this clock has a default frequency of 200MHz, on Sandy Bridge it defaults to 100MHz.

In older systems all components derived their clockrates from this base clock through the use of what we call clock multipliers and clock dividers , including the frequencies that the PCI and PCI express slots run at (PCI runs at 33MHz, the PCI express bus at 100MHz). Most modern mainboards support what is called 'untied overclocking'. In essence this means that when you change the reference clock the PCI and PCI express bus speeds will be unaffected. This is important because both the PCI and PCI express bus (and the components in the slots!) generally don't respond well to higher clockrates. A lot of modern mainboards offer separate settings for the PCI and PCI express bus which are 'untied' from the base clock. I would advise you not to change these!

**Classic architecture**

As you can see in the schematic linked above the basic components are:

* The CPU

* The Northbridge chip, connected to the CPU. In the classic design the Northbridge houses the PCI express lanes and the memory controller. The connection between the CPU and the Northbridge goes by several names: HT-link (HyperTransport Link; AMD), QPI-link (QuickPath Interconnect; Intel X58) and FSB (Front Side Bus; older Intel systems)

* The Southbridge chip, this houses 'slower' components like the old PCI slots and on some systems the slower PCI express slots (x1 slots), disk controllers, network and other stuff where speed is less critical. The connection between the Southbridge chip and the Northbridge chip also goes by different names:  A-link express (AMD) and DMI (Direct Media Interface; Intel).

* Memory and PCI express bus. The rest is of little interest in overclocking so I won't discuss them in this article.

**Recent differences in architecture**

A couple of changes have been made to the basic architecture described in the schematic above. Some changes were recent, others slightly older. To get a general picture per platform of how things now work, here's a summary:

* On AMD systems the memory controller now resides on the CPU. This means that the memory now connects directly to the CPU as opposed to being connected through the Northbridge chip. The CPU on AMD systems connects to the Northbridge chip via an interface called the HT link (HT stands for HyperTransport). The PCI express lanes still run from the Northbridge chip. This is why different chipsets on AMD systems can offer a different total number of PCI express lanes. The more lanes the more PCI express slots a mainboard can support.

* On some Intel systems (X58 chipset, LGA 1366 Xeon and Core i7 9xx) The memory controller is also on the CPU so like AMD systems the memory connects directly to the CPU and not through the Northbridge chip. Like the AMD systems the PCI express lanes are on the Northbridge chip. The connection from the CPU to the Northbridge chip is called the QPI link. QPI stands for QuickPath Interconnect and is similar to the HT link that is used in AMD systems.

* On Intel Sandy Bridge systems there is no more Northbridge chip. This means that besides the memory the PCI express lanes also connect directly to the CPU. There is still a Southbridge chip that is now also directly connected to the CPU via the DMI interface described earlier.

**Why is this important?**

The architecture changes are important because it changes the way that changes to the reference clock affect your system (any base clock change obviously also affects the CPU):

* On Sandy Bridge any change to the reference clock will change the PCI express clock. This is why an increase of as little as 3MHz will often lead to instability across the board. This more or less disqualifies Sandy Bridge from this form of overclocking. The base clock also affects other components but since we're stuck with the PCI express limits this doesn't do us any good.

* On LGA 1366 systems changes to the base clock will affect the memory clock, the speed of the QPI link and the Northbridge clock (also called Uncore Clock or UCLK). These systems can be overclocked via the base clock but since they are previous generation and I don't have access to one I won't be discussing them here.

* On AMD systems changes to the base clock affect the memory clock and the speed of the HT link between the CPU and Northbridge chip.

**Changing the base clock (AMD from here on down)**

Changing the base clock is a little more involved than simply changing the CPU multiplier because we have to consider all the other clocks that depend on it's speed. Consider this system example:

* Base clock is set at 200MHz (default)

* CPU clock is set at 3GHz through a multiplier of 15

* Memory clock is 800MHz (DDR3-1600). This basically means that the memory multiplier is set at 4 (it's not called a multiplier in most BIOSes but it really is just that).

* The HT link speed is 2000MHz through a multiplier of 10.

What happens when we up the base clock to 211MHz is this:

* CPU now runs at 3165MHz (3.165GHz) as 15 x 211 = 3165

* Memory now runs at 844MHz as 4 x 211 = 844. You could call this DDR3-1688 (DDR = Dual Data Rate so the 'effective clock' is 2 x 844 = 1688).

* The HT link speed is now 2110 MHz as 10 x 211 = 2110
While the CPU will probably run just fine at 3165MHz the memory might not. The HT link speed will probably be okay also but it might not be. Here is where the fun starts:

* Your memory might run fine if you alter the settings for your memory timings (remember the first articles about latency and timings?)

* Your HT link will be fine if you set it's multiplier from 10 to 9. It will then run at 9 x 211 = 1899MHz.
The trick when playing with the base clock is trying to find settings that will please all 3 components (CPU, memory and HT) while also improving the general performance of (preferably) all 3! You can do a lot by knowing how to calculate values that have a good chance of working.

*Since the article is getting quite long and it's getting a bit late (3.26 AM in Europe) I'll continue this in the next post.*

As part of an upcoming build I've been looking into getting a new desk/chair setup and am seriously considering getting something that supports both standard keyboard mouse gaming as well as hard mounting of wheel/pedals. Now I could just stick to my current Ikea something-a-rather desk which I don't like. But screw that, whats the point of getting tax returns if you don't use it.

The best looking reasonably priced setup I can find is the [Obutto R3volution](http://www.mainperformancepc.com/product/obutto-gaming-cockpits/obutto-r3volution-gaming-cockpit) which is a decent looking piece of kit (~900USD shipped). They also make a cheaper setup called the [Ozone](http://www.mainperformancepc.com/product/gaming-sim-cockpits/obutto-ozone-gaming-cockpit/) (~450USD Shipped) but the wheel and pedal mounts on that look average. Both have a tray for K/M and both come with monitor stands.

Anyone here own or have used either of the above Obutto's or any other kind of cockpit setup?

Thanks for the help."	t5_2sq2y	True

Built for school, programming and battling. 

Yes I could have saved some money but I really love amazon, and don't live near a microcenter. 

Fans and fan controllers are coming soon, I will update if anyone is interested. 

Also, I'm looking for a new CPU cooler, the EVO is just a place holder for now. I was looking at the some of the high end air coolers (phantek, noctua, exc) but the new H220 by swifttech is starting to look very appealing. Also, looking for sleeved cable extensions if you have any advise. 

And yes a second 7970 is in the works!

My CPU temperatures were fine but my GPU is around 100C whilst gaming. Recently, I moved which required a full drain and re-fill and for the life of me I have bled the hell out of the loop and I believe I have no more air left. The CPU temps stay fine like I mentioned before.

All the tubing and everything feels cool to the touch except the exhaust port and resevoir which have some really warm/hot water going on; thus the heat is coming after the GPU.

What should I try next? I've already bled and re-filled the loop and there cannot be any more air in there however I'm willing to try any tricks anyones got. 

Is it possible somehow the GPU has died and any load on it will cause it to constantly overheat? I'm at a loss here. 

Previous temps were in the high 40's low 50's, ambient temps have stayed the same. Now it IDLES at 52C at the desktop(used to idle around 35-37)

That was a cool thread, but frankly every desk mentioned was $200 and up, some of them were like $1000.

So I'm looking for sub $200 desks that will support at least 3 monitors and the tower itself (because fuck my carpet).

I already have a few ideas and here's what I'm thinking.

-[This](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Mainstays-Corner-Workstation-Cherry-with-Black-Accents/17479997) cheap piece of shit from Walmart. if I remove the top two shelves, I suspect the surface would be just enough for at least 3 monitors. Not to sure about the tower itself. May be too much weight, however the entire desktop has 6 points of support (the shelves themself and the two legs in the front).

-[This](http://www.amazon.com/Walker-Edison-Soreno-3-Piece-Corner/dp/B001FB5LE8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329145271&amp;sr=8-1) looks good but I'm more of corner guy, and need to sit facing the corner, not the wall. As you can see from the keyboard tray, you're supposed to face the wall and then have all that other space for whatever, maybe a printer. Fuck this, I want to sit in the middle. But I can't because the shitty wire-esque legs are going to be in my delicate legs' way.

-I hear a lot about Ikea. Someone posted [this](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50106773/) badass, and with he legs he suggested, the total price would be $130. Not bad, this seems to be the best choice so far, because fuck shitty particle board from Walmart.

___________________________________________________________

Since I frequently see questions here and on other subreddits about choosing a videocard or comparing 2 or more videocards I decided to write a short article outlining what to look for.  Also, judging by the popularity of the overclocking articles, most people here seem to like knowing a bit more about the technical details so I'll be going in-depth on this :-)

**AMD or NVidia**

___________________________________________________________

Choosing to go with AMD or NVidia is more or less a question of personal preference these days. Both offer similar price / performance ratios. They have to because reviewers will call them out on it almost instantly if they don't. To get rid of a myth while we're at it, AMD videocards don't perform better or worse on AMD mainboards.

**SLI or CrossfireX**

___________________________________________________________

 The only reason to consider your mainboard is if you want to use 2 or more videocards in an AMD CrossfireX or NVidia SLI configuration. Not all mainboards support CrossfireX and not all of them support SLI. The other aspect where your mainboard comes in to play is the number of graphics card slots a mainboard has and at what PCI express speeds they can run. The word 'speed' is not really the correct word though. PCI express x8 means that there are 8 'lanes' running from your chipset (AMD) or processor (Sandy Bridge) to a specific slot. PCI express x16 means that number of lanes is 16. 

Every solution with a single graphics card features 16 lanes on the primary graphics slot. Most solutions with 2 graphics cards have the ability to run 1 card at a 16 lane connection (x16) or 2 cards at an 8 lane connection each (x8 / x8). There are other configurations though, some are faster and some are slower but this article is about the graphics cards and not the mainboards so I won't discuss them in this article.

If you're buying a second card you'll ofcourse need to make sure that both cards support either CrossfireX or SLI as well. Not all of them do. This gets even more important when you want more than 2 cards because not all cards support  three-way scaling (or more for that matter). I'm concentrating on single card configurations in this article because there's a lot to know about a single card before considering multiple cards and all the pitfalls that a multiple card configuration brings with it. If there's a lot of interest in multiple card setups I will write about that later.

**What determines performance**

___________________________________________________________

There are several characteristics of a graphics card that determine how fast it will be. We're considering midrange graphics cards and faster that feature GDDR5 memory only:

* GPU clock speed. Like in the rest of your PC, clockspeed is an obvious indicator but in graphics cards it's not nearly as dominant a predictor as will become clear in the next few points.

* Number of stream processors. These are also called 'shaders' (generic name) or in case of current NVidia architecture 'Cuda cores'. This is the first reason clockspeed is not as important as most people think. 200 shaders running at 600MHz clock will be faster than 100 shaders running at a 1000MHz clock! Shader processor design is significantly different between NVidia and AMD GPUs so the shader count can't be directly compared between these different brands. NVidia shader cores number fewer but run at twice the GPU frequency. Shaders can be compared between the same brand but keep in mind that shader design can evolve between generations of cards of the same brand. In general though, more shader processors will be faster.

* Memory frequency. Like the GPU frequency, this too is a deceptive indicator. Why will also become clear in the next point.

* Memory bus width. Nearly all current graphics card memory run at around the same frequency of 1000MHz. GDDR5 is what they call 'quad pumped' meaning that the data rate of this memory is around 4000MHz. The memory bus width determines how many bytes of memory can be read simulteneously in one such a cycle. A single chip of memory on your videocard usually holds 128Mb of data that can be read at a rate of 64 bits (= 8 bytes) per cycle. Those 64 bits are what we call a bus width of 64. The graphics processor reads from multiple chips simultaneously giving the GPU a memory bus width of a multiple of 64. There are graphics cards with memory bus widths of 64 bits, 128 bits, 192 bits, 256 bits, 320 bits and even 384 bits. Making the bus width larger thus requires more memory chips of 64 bits each. This is the reason that some graphics cards with more memory are faster. Not because of the **amount** of memory that is on the card but because of the **bus width** that can be achieved with more physical memory chips. A 1 GB card with a 256 bit bus won't be faster than a 2GB card with a 256 bit bus! But a graphics card with 4000MHz memory and a 256 bit bus will be faster than a card with 4400MHz memory and a 192 bit bus because the 64 extra bits in the memory bus of the first card would make it comparable to a 192 bit bus with 5333MHz speed!

**Memory bandwidth**

___________________________________________________________

The memory frequency together with the memory bus width can be used to calculate the memory bandwidth of a videocard. Let's consider 2 videocards:

* GTX 460 1GB has a stock memory frequency of 900MHz and a 256 bit wide memory bus. GDDR5 has a datarate of 4 times the frequency: 4 x 900 = 3600MHz. A 256 bit memory bus equals 256 / 8 = 32 bytes of data per memory transaction at 3600 million transactions per second. 3600 million x 32 = 115200 million bytes per second. To go from megabytes per second to gigabytes per second we need to divide this number by 1 billion. The memory bandwidth of a GTX460 1GB is thus 115.2 GB/S. If you look up the specs at GeForce.com you'll see that this is exactly right.

* GTX 460 768Mb has the same memory frequency but only a 192 bit memory bus. So for the 768Mb version we get 192 / 8 = 24 bytes per memory transaction. 24*3600 = 86400, or 86.4 GB/S which again happens to be exactly what the specification on the GeForce.com site says.

**Why to calculate the bandwidth yourself**

___________________________________________________________

The reason to calculate these yourself is twofold. For one, memory clocks may differ between different brands and models of graphics cards. Also, the memory bandwidth might not be specified but it remains the easiest indicator of graphics memory performance.

A more compelling reason to do the calculation yourself is that there are 2 different numbers that are referred to as a Gigabyte. For computer engineers working with binary numbers, a Gigabyte consists of 2^30 bytes = 1,073,741,824 bytes. However for a marketing executive a Gigabyte is 10^9 = 1,000,000,000 bytes. If we would have subsituted the engineering number in the calculations above it would account for an 8GB/S difference on the GTX 460 1GB. Not exactly small change. Since it is impossible to know beforehand which number a graphics card vendor uses for calculating the bandwidth the only way to get numbers that can be compared is to do the calculations yourself!

More information about these discrepancies can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte#Consumer_confusion) on Wikipedia.

**In short**

___________________________________________________________

To recap the above, we can discern 3 major factors in determine how a graphics card will perform:

* The shader clock (same as the GPU clock in AMD Radeon but twice the GPU clock in NVidia 400 and 500 series)

* The number of shaders (also called stream processors or cuda cores) the count of which cannot be compared across AMD / NVidia platforms

* The memory bandwidth determined by the memory data rate multiplied by the memory bus width.

And as a bonus we've learned that more memory only results in more speed if it is configured in such a way that it results in a higher bus width and so a higher memory bandwidth. That you need more memory for higher than 1920x1200 resolutions is also a myth. You can check [this test at Hard|OCP]( http://www.hardocp.com/article/2011/02/24/amd_radeon_hd_6950_1gb_performance_review/3) if you need confirmation. A fully rendered frame of 2560x1600 takes up 11.7 megabytes of video memory. That is **less than 1%** of the total memory available on a 1GB videocard!!! 

The memory on a videocard is mostly used to hold textures that are wrapped around the 3d objects in a game. So more memory will start to matter when maps get bigger with more diverse graphics. For current games however the difference is mostly nonexistent!

While more memory bandwidth is a good performance indicator it is important to note that the GPU also needs to have an adequate number of stream processors working in parallel to actually make use of this extra bandwidth. That's why lower end card usually feature less bandwidth as well as less stream processors. It's also important to know that more memory bandwidth requires a more expensive circuit board design because it becomes increasingly difficult to route the higher number of connections required between the GPU and the memory chips. This is one of the reasons that ultra high-end videocards feature 2 GPUs that both have their own discrete memory (HD 6990 and GTX 590).

Since this has become quite a lengthy article so far, I'll leave it to be continued. The second part will appear in the next few days!

Overclocking Basics - Part 8: Steps for overclocking the CPU (unlocked)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Remember: overclocking / overvolting can damage system components. Proceed at your own risk!**

**Unlocked multiplier **

Since this is still 'Basics' we're going to concern ourselves with CPUs that have an unlocked multiplier for now. CPUs with a locked multiplier require additional knowledge which we will get to once we move on to the more advanced stuff. The advanced stuff will also be interesting to those with an unlocked multiplier CPU because it allows for more fine tuning of the CPU as well as getting extra performance from components other than the CPU.

**Turbo modes**

For CPUs with turbo modes I choose to disable the turbo mode and set the multiplier to the turbo setting as a default. Turbo modes are designed to increase the clock on part of the CPUs cores to increase the performance of single-threaded applications (as well as some multithreaded apps as it usually increases the frequency of more than one core). The reason for not increasing all cores to a higher setting is usually to limit the TDP so as to stay within the specified limits, meaning that for instance an i5 Sandy Bridge keeps within it's specified 95W TDP for all cores at stock speeds as well as part of it's cores at the turbo speeds. I'm assuming here that you have a processor cooler with a TDP that is better than what your processor needs at stock clocks! TDP (thermal design profile) is a measurement that applies to both processors and heatsinks as it specifies how much heat the processor produces at stock settings but for the heatsink it specifies how much heat it is capable of dissipating.

**TDP and Temperature Delta**

TPD of a heatsink is not a static value. How much a heatsink is able to dissipate from your processor casing's surface depends on the ambient temperature (the surrounding temperature of the heatsink in your PC case). This is why case airflow is also important as is the room temperature of the room your computer is in. Keep this in mind when you form expectations of how your heatsink will perform. This is also the main reason heatsinks perform differently in different surroundings and PC cases. It's the most likely reason you are getting different temperatures than other overclockers (as opposed to the quality of the thermal paste you are using). 

Thermal paste performance is a myth for the most part. I'm not advocating the use of cheap thermal paste here, but it makes less difference than it's often given credit for and I don't like myths as they lead to uninformed decisions.

**Setting the multiplier initial value for a processor with a Turbo Mode**

This is easy, I usually start with setting the multiplier to the Turbo value while disabling the turbo mode. This is likely to be stable (if the TDP of the cooling solution is adequate).

**Setting the multiplier initial value for a processor without a Turbo Mode**

Usually I start with upping the multiplier value by 2 before starting stability testing.

**The procedure**

As with the GPU it's really a simple iteration:

* Set the multiplier value to the desired level

* Do stability testing with both Prime95 and IntelBurnTest for 8 hours or until either programs detects an error. Stop the stability testing if the processor reaches 65 degrees Celsius. While this is an arbitrary number for the most part, it's the value at which most overclockers start to get concerned. Also keep an eye on the other temperatures that are reported from your mainboard. These are usually measured on the northbridge chip among other places. Personally I don't like these to be higher than 65 degrees Celsius either, but both values are just estimates. Oftentimes official information on this is hard to come by and there are a lot of different chipsets out there. This is one of the reasons any overclocking is always at your own risk!

* If errors were detected or temperatures get too high decrease the multiplier by 1 and start again from the testing phase.

* If no errors were detected and temperatures stayed within limits, you can up the multiplier by one and loop back to the stability testing :-)

* Once you are reasonably certain you have a stable overclock it's wise to run 2 more tests: a test for 24 hours with Prime95 and a test for 24 hours with IntelBurnTest. If this doesn't produce any errors you can be pretty sure you have a stable system!

Remember, for all testing  applications 1 simple rule applies: if the stability test finds ***ANY*** errors your clocks are set too high!

Overclocking Basics - Part 6: Tools to test your videocard
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**More reliable testing**

As was pointed out to me in the previous article's comments, FurMark is a benchmarking tool and not really a stability test. I put FurMark in the basic steps because it is used frequently to quickly and easily test how high your temperatures shoot up. FurMark is known for the impressive amount of heat it can produce in your GPU :-) GPUs can get extremely hot and so temperatures are a bigger enemy in videocards than they are with the CPU. On recent intel systems people have actually gotten quite high overclocks (4GHz and up) on the intel stock cooler. With videocards this is a different story.

The stress testing in the previous article was meant to be done by a few hours of gaming. This is also what most people consider to be the best test for stability. GPU stability testing tools do exist but oftentimes they are not really being maintained by the authors. Overclocking GPUs remains a bit of a niche and hobbyist domain. With all the factory overclockable cards that have hit the market recently though, this will probably change :-)

**Tools for error checking**

Here are two tools for testing your GPU which scan for errors in the memory or rendering calculations:

* [OCCT v3.1.0](http://www.ocbase.com/perestroika_en/index.php?Download) (Overclock Checking Tool). This is a very nice looking tool that also produces interesting graphs of the temperatures, voltages and other stuff going on in your graphics card while testing. It's been around for a while (I used it for **C**PU stability testing in my previous build). The programmer states that it's development has not stopped but it looks like it has slowed down for a bit ;-) OCCT offers videomemory testing and GPU rendering testing. Have a look, it will allow for better stability testing of your overclock before you start gaming and so might spare you a crash while you're on an FPS killing spree ;-)

* [VMT v1.7]( http://mikelab.kiev.ua/PROGRAMS/vmt.zip) (Video Memory Stress Test) A tool for testing your video memory. The OCCT author states that he's not happy with the videomemory test in that application so I've put this up as a tool for additional testing. The site is in Russian so the link points to the file directly. If your Russian is better than mine, the site is [here](http://mikelab.kiev.ua/) ;-)
For stress testing an overclocked **C**PU there are even better tools than OCCT but I'll swing back around to the **C**PU after the weekend.

For both these applications 1 simple rule applies: if the stability test finds ***ANY*** errors your clocks are set to high and it would be wise to cut back on the overclock. The longer you run the tests the more sure you can be that things are running OK. Sometimes an error will present in a matter of minutes, sometimes after an hour. Overclockers working on the **C**PU usually test for 24 hours on 100% load before declaring a system ""stable"". I would not advise you to do this on a graphics card though :-) I'd run for up to an hour while you stay behind your desk so you can intervene if something awkward happens.

**Request** If you know of any additional tools for stability testing a GPU and/or videoram, please post a reply in this post, I'd be happy to learn about any new tools!

Hey Reddit, I'm the designer and one-half of the team behind the NCASE M1 project - an attempt to design and produce a compact performance-oriented Mini-ITX case with the help of the community. We're currently into the third day of our crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo and well on track to hitting our (admittedly modest) goal, with over 2/3rds funded already.

This initial fundraising campaign is *only* to get the prototypes manufactured and tested.  If everything goes according to plan, we will then be moving on to a second campaign (likely on Kickstarter) for a **full, limited production run** of 300-500 units.

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer as best as I can.

Our current Indiegogo campaign is [here](http://igg.me/at/ncase-m1-prototype/x/2412477), if you'd like to support our effort.

Articles on our project have been published by [MaximumPC](http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/ncase_m1_ambitious_attempt_mold_mini_itx_case_enthusiasts2013), as well as [Techspot](http://www.techspot.com/news/51650-crowdfunded-ncase-m1-mini-itx-enthusiast-chassis-inches-toward-reality.html).

1336409140.0	tbdg7	Some things to consider before buying a Surround setup, My personal pros and cons of the technology.	TheSnooter	32	3	60	"Please be aware I wanted to wait a little longer to proof read this thread and make it a bit more coherent however, there seems to be ~~many~~ some people who want to know what my issues are with surround so I went ahead and posted this as is until I have to time to go back and fix any mistakes. 

Every so often there is a post asking whether or not Surround/Eyefinity is worth all the hype, I myself basically asked this question not a month ago and now I want to share my experience. My only goal with this post is to help others decided whether this would be worth it or not by giving some of my personal experience with the technology; I am just going to list what I think are the pros and cons from my limited use. As a disclaimer of sorts some of these problems might have an easy fix, if this is the case and you have a solution I would really love to hear it and, remember these are problems **I MYSELF** am experiencing so everyone is going to have a different opinion and experience. 

I’ll start with the pros first because when Surround works, man does it really work, it immerses you in your game unlike any other gaming medium right now can do. Maybe 3D surround would be more immersive but I don’t like 3D so I’ll probably never know. 

* Brand new games that are built with Surround support are really great, especially first person games. You almost feel like you’re the player character because you have your normal field of vision and also peripheral vision like you do irl. BF3 looks great across three screens especially on the wide open maps on multiplayer. This is where Surround really shines because it doesn’t distort what you would normally view but only adds to it.

* WoW is also pretty fun to play like this but if you were going to pay seriously you would need to do some serious UI tweaks to get everything on your main screen. Not a big deal since most people play with addons anyway but worth mentioning. 

* Dead Space is where I have been having the most fun lately. Both 1 and 2 were on sale for 5 bucks each on steam last week so I grabbed them. Playing dead space in a dark room, with the volume turned up and spanning across three displays is quite an experience. It isn’t an FPS but I feel like it works really well with surround especially for being an older game relative to games that are truly optimized for Surround. 


With the good out of the way I’ll get into the cons. I’ll say right off the bat that most of these issues I am having is probably some kind of driver issue or because surround doesn’t work well with non-gaming programs but it’s annoying and jarring nonetheless. 

* Nvidia adverties the GTX 680 as being able to handle 3 monitors for surround and, 1 extra display for whatever you wanted, cool right? Overall this is a huge step up since to my knowledge you had to have an SLI setup if you wanted surround in the past, whereas AMD has offered single card Eyefinity support for some time now. When setting up surround on with my 2 680s the screen told me I had to have 2 monitors plugged into GPU 1 and 1 monitor in GPU 2. Ok not a big deal I thought at the time, a little weird to me but whatever. This really isn’t a con until later on down the road. 

* Google Chrome was one of the first programs I opened after setting up surround and I immediately noticed something weird. There is a border all around the window as if it isn’t full screened, even when it appears to be at full screen. Meaning I hit the maximize button or drag and flick the window on top of the screen in W7. Also if I full screen the window sometimes the top bar glitches out and almost duplicates itself [Picture]( http://i.imgur.com/h91MG.png). You’ll see the glitch I’m talking about and also if you look to the right side you can kind of see the usual windows border has also bugged out and is white and blue. The dark blue is the start of my other screen to ignore that. I discovered that I could eliminate the glitch part if I used the default chrome skin. The border is still there and is stupid looking and bugs me every time I use it I have not figured out how to fix it if it is possible. I think the problem stems from the fact that Surround treats all monitors as one big one, duh. Chrome thinks it is never fully maximized because of this and thus has a window border around it. Not really sure if this is a problem on the chrome or Nvidia side but it annoys me to no end. 

* Along the same I have yet to find a way to keep Netflix maximized on one screen while doing anything else on another. I have turned off surround and just had the multiple monitors on at once and could full screen Netflix and still do whatever on the other screens. Once again it is probably some kind of weird issue with how Surround treats all three screens as one but I can’t figure out how to fix it if there is one. 

* By far the worst of all these inconveniences is the issues that arise when trying to play many older, and not so old games. Just as a point of reference when you use a surround resolution in BF3 the game obviously the game spans across all 3 screens, when you want to just use a single screen without turning surround off in the control panel you just change the res to a single screen res. Simple right? If only all games worked this way.

In all honesty some issues with older games should be expected but I didn’t think there would be this many issues simply trying to play on a single screen. What I mean is an example like these. 

* I tried to load up Bastion but the game would not visually appear on any screen. I could hear the title screen music but all my screens were black. I eventually figured out how to auto launch the game in windowed mode via steam but, why should I have to go through all this. I am not really sure why some games won’t load at all when surround is on, even when the resolution is set to a single screen resolution. There are many other games that either don’t load at all or load across three screens very poorly to the point of not being able to play. 

* Dawn of War 2 will constantly crash on a single screen resolution and, when I turn surround on it’s a mess to look at and doesn’t add anything to the experience. The expansion Chaos Rising doesn’t have the single screen res issue.  I downloaded the demo for Warlock and that game loads across 3 screens but I can’t click anything cause the screen is so messed up and zoomed in I can’t see any buttons. I could go on and on but basically if you play a game that came out before Surround/Eyefinity was a thing you’re probably gonna have some kind of issue. 


* Probably my most infuriating game to date is Crysis. I bought the extreme edition on sale from Amazon and really wanted to see how my PC stood up to this game. Even though its 5 years old it is still one of the most demanding games so like any aspiring enthusiast I wanted to see how my rig held up. Long story short: even though this game launch fine in a single screen display and had a single screen res, it was utterly unplayable. I turned everything to the lowest settings and the res down as low as it would go and I was still getting &lt;20FPS while stationary, even less when I actually moved. I turned surround off and booted the game up and the game was flawless on ultra-settings with AA on. Don’t really know what the problem was but obviously it was cause by surround being on. 
The last little weird thing I’ve noticed is when some games have Surround support but are just being played on a single monitor are alt tabbed they automatically switch to windowed mode. Crysis 2 does this a bunch. 

This is pretty much why I wish you could have all the monitors hooked up to GPU one with surround on. That way I could just surround on and off while still activating SLI on all 3 monitors. TBH I’m not sure how/If this would work as a solution I have not had time to fiddle around with switching back and forth.I really need to play around with plugging in my monitors to try and optimize it in a way where I can switch back and forth without hassle but I doubt I’ll ever find a happy medium. 

I know it sounds like I am bashing Surround but when it comes down to it I do think this is a really neat technology. When it works it works really well and as I said before offers a gaming experience unique to PC. I just want others to be aware that for everyday use it’s a big PITA. I am sure over the years as drivers and software are optimized with the thought of multiple monitor displays a lot of these issues will go away, I can only hope.

Soon I'll be adding another 7970, a 200mm radiator for the front fan, and adding the graphics cards to the loop.

Now there's a couple of things I want to say about some of these parts.

First, the 600T. This case is perfect. And by perfect I don't mean it was a joy to work with. It was hell and I expected nothing more. For as big as this case is, it gets small very quickly. I barely had enough space to squeeze in the radiator over top of the over sized motherboard. Forget anything thicker and to hell with push pull. Put it is the perfect size as far as there being nearly no space wasted (except for behind the front fan, but I'm going to fill that up soon enough. The only real bad things about this case are very minimal. It lacks good water cooling support, bigger PSUs will have trouble with space if you have the hard-drive cage placed like mine, and it doesn't have a 20 pin header for the front panel USB 3.0. Other than that, this case is awesome and I enjoyed wrestling with it.

The Rampage IV Extreme. This thing has a ton of features. More than I care to list at this time. If you can afford it, and have the space, it's an amazing board. I could only find a few things wrong with it, and I had to nitpick. It requires a ton of plugs. Normally it wouldn't be too much of a problem, but since I had minimal space to route cables behind the radiator and in between the PSU and HDD cage it was a VERY tight fit to get everything in. I fear that many PSUs will also lack the required amount of the correct cables to plug into it as well. That and the fan on the southbridge is absolutely the loudest thing in my rig. It's not a ""true"" EATX board either, it's only slightly larger and will fit most ATX size cases.

A few people seem to have some problems with OCZ's SSDs. Most of the bad blood was from firmware issues that caused crashes early in their life. However OCZ has updated firmware available that completely eliminates any problems. Other than that, there's not much I can say other than it's wicked fast.

The PSU is awesome. It came with a TON of cables and being fully modular there is a lot of flexibility. [Here's an unboxing album for those of you that would like to see it.](http://imgur.com/a/5MrFl) One of the nifty things about the hybrid series is that when there is low power draw the fan will actually shut off to stay quieter, and will gradually spin up as the power draw increases. You can also switch it back to normal mode to have the fan on all the time.

The CPU is great, I haven't done much benchmarking, and I haven't done a full Prime 95 workout on it yet either. But it's cool to see 8 cores on my desktop monitor. So far it's living up to its reputation as the low end high end.

As for the 7970, I did an [unboxing and review](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/pt2v3/7970_unboxing_and_benchmarking/) on it a while back when I got it.

Now on to the Raystorm kit. I absolutely love it. The pump is dead silent on the lower settings and still quiet on the highest setting. It pushes a huge amount of water as well. The only qualm I have with it, is the return ports almost directly back into the pump making bubbles just go around and around in circles. On another post of mine I read that someone put a piece of tubing they had cut in half in between the return and the intake. I tried that after a few minutes of frustration and it worked like a charm. I just cranked the pump up to full and the bubbles were all cleared in minutes. Not a single leak on the first run through. I'm sure it's due to the awesome compression fittings that come with the kit. My fingers are a bit bruised and battered from tightening the hell out of them though. The LEDs are also a very nice touch to the block. Again I haven't really done much testing yet, but here are the temps so far. Ambiant: 23  Idle: 25-27  1Hr of Prime95: 44-46

If there's anything else you would like to know just ask and I'll try and answer the best I can."	t5_2sq2y	True

* Ran Memtest for over 12 hours and after 6 full passes, there were no errors.  **Is it safe to say the RAM is not the problem and is OK?**
* Updated BIOS to latest firmware.
* Since updating BIOS firmware: 
* * SSD: benchmarks are all normal EXCEPT **4K Writes** which have improved but are still underperforming by about 33%.  This is definitely progress, but any ideas why that specific benchmark could be underperforming while everything else is now normal?
* * Sleep issue:  Put computer to Sleep, and it stayed asleep (remember, before it would wake up automatically after about 30 seconds).  Woke it up after 15 minutes, and several minutes later, noticed Q-Code was at “AA” (remember, it used to remain at ""30"", which was the Sleep cycle).  This is the first time I’ve witnessed  the Motherboard report a normal Q-Code of “AA” after waking up from a Sleep.  Again, this is definitely progress.
* * Have been running Prime95 Torture Test for over 2 hours now after waking the computer up, while looping TWO Youtube clips on EndlessYoutube.com (remember, my PC had frozen twice while on Youtube previously), with no errors so far.  During this time, I decided to push my computer to the limit, and also ran 3dMarks11 benchmark.  System did not crash, and got a 3DMarks score of P4385.  **How long should I run Prime95 for?**
* * CPU &amp; Fan Info after 2+ hours of Prime95:  http://i.imgur.com/UqSFG.png  (I have no idea how to read this, **is it all looking normal?**)
* Graphics Card:  **Can someone please confirm if a 3DMarks score of around *7200* is indeed low for my specs?**  I’m not yet clear on that, but have not benchmarked the card since after the BIOS update (other than during Prime95 as above), so I'll have to wait until I complete the Prime95 testing before benchmarking it again.

So it seems the BIOS firmware update has helped in at least a few areas, so I'm glad to see some progress.  Thanks for everyone's help so far, I know that last thing you guys want to be doing on the weekend is helping someone with their PC troubles.  Hopefully I can get this all resolved and running smoothly by tomorrow, or at least pin-point the cause and get it exchanged.  Thanks again and I'll continue to answer all the posts and keep everyone updated until this is 100% resolved.

**Notes:**

* No major issues during build.
* All latest Drivers and Windows Updates have been installed

**Turning On First Time:**

First time I turned it on, got a green flashing screen.  Turned it off.  Waited a few minutes, turned it back on, worked OK (never had the green screen problem since).  Got CPU Fan errors.  Read on forum that’s normal for Noctua NH-D14 fan due to efficient RPM, so I lowered CPU Fan Alarm threshold and never got the CPU fan error again.

**Main Issues:**

* When it wakes up from from a short sleep, the Q-Code stays at “30” (which refers to the sleep cycle).  A couple of times I saw it stay at “30” and then it changed to “80” (DXE Initialization) while still working, but I never saw it go back to “AA” after waking up.  Shouldn’t the Q-Code change to normal “AA” status once the computer wakes up and has been used for over 30 minutes?  In case it helps, when I put it to sleeps, it goes from “AA”, to “03” (System Agent initialization before microcode loading), and then goes off.
* At first, computer would wake up immediately from a short (few hours or less) sleep.  But it did not seem to respond to an overnight sleep.  After leaving it asleep overnight, pressing the keyboard or moving the mouse did nothing.  I had to shut it off.
* Now, after installing the last 36 Windows updates, it only sleeps for about 30 seconds and then wakes up by itself but the screen is still blank. If I move the mouse, Windows then appears normally on the screen.
* Computer has frozen at least four times so far.  Once when editing the Windows Hosts file in Notepad, second time while opening a Youtube Video, third time when running 3dMark11, fourth time while opening a Youtube video again.  I checked the Q-Code of the MB when the second freeze and fourth freeze happened and it showed a Q-Code of “30” on both occasions, so it might have to do with the Sleep.  When it freezes, the screen stays on whatever it was on, but nothing moves or reacts or changes (neither on the screen nor on the computer itself).  It simply stops responding and reacting.  When it froze on 3dMark11, the screen was just dark and stayed that way (I ran 3dMark 11 4 times, it only froze on one of those four times).

______________________________

Based on all of the above, it is clear to me that something is very wrong with my build, which is quite disheartening after all the time and money I invested in it.  

**Please help me figure out all these issues as I’m way in over my head and have no idea how to diagnose or resolve them.**

Building a PC was far more complicated than I anticipated (especially due to the poor instructions in the manuals regarding so many cables), but I thought it was still worth it when I finally finished the build and saw what I had created with my own two hands.  Now, with all these problems that my old Dell never gave me (it pains me to say that), I’m starting to have regrets and second-thoughts, especially since I saved up a lot of money to buy top-of-the-line components to avoid precisely these kinds of issues.  To be honest, after this experience, I probably won’t be building a PC ever again, but I want to at least salvage this one so that it lasts me at least 3 years.

**I’m willing to test, diagnose, and try anything, so I’m all ears.**

Please help.  Thank you."	t5_2sq2y	True

I'll try and spend as close to $60 as I can. So if I consider the most worthy of you to be someone that only wants a $30 game, I'll pick someone else as well who also wants a game for $30. But don't let that discourage you from going all out with your requests.

I'll announce the winner sometime on Friday the 30th, so those of you away from home for the holidays might have enough time to snap a picture. If you really can't get back home in time, I'll make an exception if you post a link to a thread were you have previously shown off your computer.

If you win I'll contact you through PM's and arrange the gift.

P.S. Specs are always nice too. Try and make sure you're not requesting a game your computer won't be able to run. I don't want to give Skyrim away to someone who won't even be able to run it. Sorry I can't also offer BF3, but I don't want to have any hiccups caused by Origin.


EDIT: If you're wondering. [This](http://i.imgur.com/PXVSJ.png) is probably why I'm feeling so generous.

**EDIT: Remember not to leave out what game you would like.**

_________________________________________

In the post yesterday about PCI express connections I already wrote that the story would continue, so here it is! There's a couple of things that will determine if you will benefit from x16/x16 graphics cards. To recoup the previous issues:

* What particular game you are running will determine how much the performance will benefit from a full x16/x16 connection. Large open world games will likely benefit more, especially upcoming (really large) ones.

* How much memory is available in the graphics cards will determine how much the PCI express connection will need to be used. The PCI express connection is likely to be of less importance if there is more than 1GB per card of videomemory.
It is important to remember that the PCI bus connection to your graphics card is primarily used to transfer data from your main memory to your graphics memory. This data we're talking about are the [textures]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping) and [meshes]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh) that make up a scene in your 3D game environment. 

Please realize that both the textures and the meshes that make up a game world are bigger when you are playing on high settings. More detailed textures and meshes will thus run you out of video memory sooner. 

The rendering process itself is only dependent on the speed of the GPU and not on the speed of the PCI express link. **This is why running a benchmark to compare render speeds will tell you absolutely nothing about any x16 advantage over x8.**

The problem only shows when a scene doesn't completely fit in the video memory. When that happens the GPU will need new data halfway through the rendering process and will thus have to wait on that data to arrive over the PCI express bus. If it has to wait on data during every frame rendering a x8 link will cost dearly: if you consider a framerate of 60fps you'd have at least 120 data transfers per second. One transfer to each card and these have to wait for eachother to finish because only one card at a time can read from main memory!! This effectively means that with 2 cards it's even more important they run at x16 than with 1 card.
With dual x16 slots every wait would be cut in half. 

Truth be told for current games and with 1GB videocards this doesn't happen often. However games never stay 'current' for very long. Especially with the 4th quarter releases fast approaching. How much you will gain from x16 / x16 remains to be seen but the gain is going to be more than it is now.

To illustrate what I mean, here are some [figures and design stragegies on Battlefield 3]( http://i.imgur.com/lErkR.png). Resource streaming is the sending of data to the videocard while in the middle of rendering a frame. As you can also see, Battlefield 3 maps are much larger than 1GB. DICE can't require larger than 1GB video memory but I think this slide makes pretty clear that they really would have wanted to.

Intel is going to include PCI express 3.0 support in Ivy Bridge. The main reason for going PCI express 3.0 is to double the bandwidth. The upcoming Radeon HD 7000 series will very likely also support PCI express 3.0. It always strikes me as odd that the people stating they don't need x16 / x16 are often the same people that are looking forward to Ivy Bridge and HD 7000. Upcoming PCI express 3.0 at x8 / x8 will be exactly as fast as PCI express 2.0 at x16 / x16 on current mainboards is.

If AMD (which currently has the only real x16 / x16 boards) is giving people something they don't need then why is Intel scrambling to make up for the difference in Ivy Bridge?

Edit: Intel X58 based boards (LGA 1366) also had the capacity for x16/x16 graphics (thanks icono). For AMD you'll need the FX chipsets if you want x16/x16 graphics.

Sandy Bridge currently only supports x8 / x8 PCI express graphics. At the moment this can only be solved by designing mainboards that have the NVidia NF200 chip. On these boards both cards talk to the NF200 at x16/x16 but the NF200 talks to the mainboard memory via a single PCI express x16 link. So while your cards register as x16/x16 on these boards in reality they are somewhere in between true x16/x16 and x8/x8.

**Closing thoughts**

* If intel didn't see the need for higher PCI express bandwidth coming they wouldn't put any effort towards including it in Ivy Bridge

* If consumers or gamers can never use more than 4 cores then why does Sandy Bridge E even have them? And before you scream 'video encoding' think about how many people you know that do video encoding vs the number of people you know that do gaming.

_______________________________________________

As a final remark, bear this in mind:

Having x8/x8 graphics cards is fine and having 1GB is fine too. I just hate that people state that it doesn't make a difference. The correct thing to say would be that it doesn't ***always*** make a difference.

Having no bottlenecks in your system is always a good thing as games tend to grow heavier on the CPU and GPU as they evolve in to bigger and better games. The same goes for multi-core systems. A system with 6 cores on half load will be more responsive than a system with 4 cores on full load. You don't need the 6 cores but saying that it doesn't make a difference is an opinion, not a fact. If you want opinions go to Yahoo ask, if you want facts, read a book ;-)

1375895572.0	1jw7tw	Sticky: Welcome (basic rules inside, please read before contributing)	Markus_Antonius	44	21	17	"Hey newcomer!

/r/gamingpc is a community of people that love building their own custom gaming rigs and talking about the latest and greatest hardware that PC gaming has to offer. It was founded as a place where people are allowed to splurge on their hobby, even though some of the things we do are **not necessary** in order to play games on a PC. We all know you don't need multiple videocards, watercooling and all the other things we add to our systems. That said, we don't need to hear that we're spending too much money, we know this.

This is the place to build and share your own creation and to discuss newly released hardware. If you've never built a PC before you're welcome to lurk here and see what others are doing. If you want to learn how to build a computer you need to post in /r/buildapc. The same goes for upgrading it (questions like 'what videocard should I upgrade to' or 'will this max out Crysis 5').

In order to keep this place fun for the more advanced builders and gaming veterans we do not allow posting of technical comments or 'facts' unless you have a professional background in IT. There is a huge difference between citing a medical book and being a doctor. Computer architecture is no different. Also keep in mind that many hardware review websites are run by hobbyists. Don't quote their findings unless you have the background that allows you to explain these findings. The gaming world is full of myths regarding hardware and performance and we don't need the myths in here. Do feel free to share your own benchmarks and reviews on hardware that you own and play on yourself :-)

* If you're looking for a laptop, /r/suggestalaptop is the place to be.

* If you have issues with your computer you can find help in /r/techsupport.

* Prebuilt gaming computers are for the most part not very good computers. Nothing below $2000 usually holds a candle to building your own. We are not a shopping forum for prebuilt computers however so questions about them are removed. This also applies to questions like 'where can I find the cheapest [insert anything here]'.

Because of the volume of posts, those that don't fit here will be quietly removed.

We often get reasons for posting questions in here that state ""but all the experts are here"". Remember that these people are here because they just want to enjoy their hobby. Most of us have demanding jobs and we don't want to spend our evenings doing free techsupport. Those of us that don't mind doing this will also be in /r/buildapc and /r/techsupport. Do not post questions that belong in those subreddits in here.

For questions that do belong here: **do your own research before posting a question and share what you have found by yourself.** If you don't do this, your post will be removed. And no, we don't believe that you did not find anything.

If you need the mods for anything you can [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgamingpc). You can usually also find some of us in the [IRC channel (chat)](http://www.dal.net:9090/?channels=reddit-gamingpc&amp;uio=MTE9MA4c). Most people in the channel lurk while doing other things so you might not get an immediate reply. Feel free to hang around with us, interesting things do happen, just not every 30 seconds ;-)

The build went pretty great for a first time. It took me about 5 hours but I made sure everything is in place and working. A few hiccups though: Installing Windows in 32-bit, I tried cable management but it went 'Meh' and I was terrified to connect the front panel power/reset switch and LEDs.

I am writing this here for a few simple reasons.

* a) I think this constitues as a high end build

* b) After weeks and months of lurking I trust you guys more than BaPC

* c) and lastly because after hearing my story I think you will understand my plight

TLDR at the bottom

For a ~~really~~ fairly short background I discovered r/BaPC a few months ago and read over all the guides, posts, and FAQs and decided it was time to build another PC. I am 23 years old and the last time I ""built"" was when I was
15. I say ""built"" because my cousin did most of the work but I watched with extreme interest and I always wanted to build again. After feeling confident that I had all the information I needed I started out pretty modest. The cookie cutter 2500k build
and reserved my GPU to the upcoming 7850s. I was just going to get one. After impatientely buying all of the parts sans the GPU I put my PC together and was hooked. I quickly upgraded my ram from ""you only need 8gb"" 
to 16gb just because, why not? When the 7850s and 7870s lauched I was foaming at the mouth. I decided well hell I might as well get the 7870, pfft lets make it two. This next part I am really ashamed to admit but 
I am going to tell it anyway. I ordered two MSI 7870s the day they came out. A few days later I ordered two more Saphhire 7870s because I didnt know if I would like the MSI brand. I made a post about this on BaPC and
gamingpc but I claimed to only have one of each because it was stupid to buy the two(four) of them. So sitting in my room were 4 7870s just tempting me to open them, then the GTX 680 specs and benchs started to get leaked.
To wrap up this long and sad story I returned all 4 of my 7870s (sorry online vendor) and bought two EVGA 680s, I was lucky to catch the second wave of them.


* So on to my questions and point. Here I am sitting with a pretty sick rig but I feel like my 2500k is already 
holding me back. Thanks to psikeiro and his comparisons for PCIe 2.0 and 3.0 I feel like I need to have a 
SB-e CPU to unlock the full potential of my rig. Especially since I have two more Dell U2412Ms on the way. My questions are this.


* Will upgrading my Mobo and CPU cause a lot of problems on my SSD(OS drive). I have read some posts on how 
to make this a no hassle ordeal but I would still like more reassurance. For the CPU I plan on getting the i7-3930K, I am open to suggestions on why the 3820 will do me just fine however. 


* For the Mobo I have chosen the [ASrock X79 Extreme7](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?
Item=N82E16813157284), upgrading from my current extreme4 gen3, almost out of necessity. You see I have a PCI network card that I like and the extreme7 seems to be the only X79 board that will allow me to have SLI and also use a PCI  slot. I am really open to suggestions here because I don't really know much about other networks cards or what my other possibilites are. I currently have [this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833127219) network card and am very pleased with it. So if I got lets say a USB network card or a PCIe network card (if that exists) that was comparable to my current one then I would be open to suggestions for a different Mobo if you feel this one isnt good enough. 


* Another thing that makes me apprehensive to buy this mobo is my current [16gb of ram](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231429) is not on the supported list. It is quad channel and by all means should work but I just don't know how seriosuly I should take the memory supported list. 


A bonus question is this, after reading all of Markus' post on PCIe 3.0 among other resources I dont understand how SB-e supports PCIe actually supports PCIe 3.0. The intel website says it only supports 2.0 and so does the mobo website. So how is it that people are running PCIe 3.0 with SB-e chips?

I know this may sound to some like whining or just being stupid but I feel like I can always make my PC better and hope at least some of you understand. I am paying the price literally and figurativly for not doing as
much  research as I should have and being hasty. I originally started with a budget of 1500 but I have well exceeded 3k and I think I can afford a little more.

Like I said at the begining I feel like this subreddit is an appropriate place for this kind of question but if not I will gladly take it down and post it to BaPC in 24 hours. 
To those of you who read my full story I thank you, and to those of you who somewhat understand my plight I thank you even more. 

TLDR

* How hard is it to upgrade from a Asrock extrem4 gen3 and 2500k to a SB-e and ASrock X79 extreme7. 

* What would upgrading entail? Could I keep all the info on my current SSD without much issue?

* Will this ram work in the extreme7 even though it isnt on the supported memory list. 

Edited for format

Edit: Thank you all for the sound advice and reassurance. I tried to respond to everyone and I want you to know I will take all advice and points into consideration. The overwhelming opinion is to hey why not try to keep your data but clean install is best. I will have to think on this some more. 

Also whether it is proper rediquette or not I went and upvoted everyone's comment because I felt like they were all helpful in their own way and I do appreciate the fact that you took time to respond at all. I will be sure yo keep you all updated on what I decide to do. "	t5_2sq2y	True

[First off here's the unboxing album.](http://imgur.com/a/wriUk)

The first comment I would like to make is: This thing is MASSIVE. It's not much longer than my 6950 but it weighs about twice as much. It's hard to respect the mass of this thing until you actually have it in your hands. Giggity &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;.

Now on to the benchmarks.

My rig is as fallows:

* i5-2500k @ 4.5ghz
 
* ASUS Z68 DELUXE
 
* OCZ Agility 3 120GB
 
* 8GB Corsair Vengeance
 
* And obviously the 7970.

[First things first. Here's the default specs using GPU-Z.](http://i.imgur.com/cIG5a.png)

[On 3D Mark 11 I received a graphics score of 7799.](http://i.imgur.com/EUeFx.png)

On Unigine Heaven I ran it on full setting at both [4xAA](http://i.imgur.com/Lj3Ai.png) and [8xAA](http://i.imgur.com/fak7t.png), receiving scores of 1119 and 974.

I also ran BF3 on completely maxed out setting. It played at a steady 50-65 FPS with a low of 45 and a High of 90 FPS.

After [overclocking](http://i.imgur.com/fUYoB.png) I ran the the benchmarks again.

[With the overclock, I recieved a significantly increased graphics score of 9162 on 3D Mark 11.](http://i.imgur.com/VLozv.png)

With 4xAA i received a score of [1306](http://i.imgur.com/XoRe5.png) on Unigine Heaven and a score of [1141](http://i.imgur.com/gtDNi.png) with 8xAA.

After running BF3 again I noticed only a very marginal difference. It played at a steady 55-70 FPS with a low of 45 and a high of 95 FPS.

This is definitely the best card I've ever had and I regret nothing.

Now that we've touched on the subject of the CPU, let's move on to memory. It's important to have read the part on CPU cache because that's a major influence that can conceal the performance of your system memory and render memory speed inconsequential for a lot of tasks!

DDR Memory
-------------

The current generation of memory that is used in PCs is DDR3 memory. DDR is an abbreviation of ""Double Data Rate"". The 3 in the name means that we're currently on the third generation of DDR memory.

Double Data Rate means that the speed on which DDR memory can be read is twice the clockspeed. In effect this means that DDR3-1600 runs on a clockspeed of 800MHz, DDR3-1333 runs on a clockspeed of 667MHz. Notice the absence of the MHz unit after 1600 and 1333. This is the correct notation!

Memory Timings
----------------

Aside from the clockspeed the memory is running on there is another major factor that determines memory performance: timings. You might have read specifications like ""DDR3 1600 CL9"" or ""DDR3 1600 9-9-9-25"" or something similar. The latter part of the memory specification are the timings. The most important memory timing is what is called the ""CAS Latency"". CAS is shorthand for ""Column Access Strobe"". We'll get back later to what this means exactly. The CAS Latency is the first number in a row of timings, so given the example, ""9-9-9-25"" would mean a CAS Latency of 9. The number behind the CL notation also specifies the CAS Latency so for the example ""CL9"" means a CAS Latency of 9.

Timings and Clockspeed
-----------------------

For memory timings there is a simple rule but with a caveat: the lower the timing value the faster the memory reacts to a read or write request from the processor or other components in your system. **However** memory timings are not measured in milliseconds or nanoseconds, memory timings are measured in ***clockcycles!***

As a consequence memory timings can only be directly compared if the clockspeed of both DIMMS is the same. A value of 9 for CAS Latency means that it takes 9 clockcycles before data can be read from a DIMM module from the time this data was requested until such time that the data is ready to be read. This is where clockspeed comes into play. In order to compare the memory reaction speed of memory that runs on different clockspeeds we need to know how long a clockcycle takes.

Let's consider 2 examples:

**1. DDR3 1600 CL9**

As stated earlier the clockspeed of DDR3 1600 is 800MHz. 800MHz means 800 Million clockcycles per second. 1 clockcycles thus takes 1 / 800,000,000 seconds = 0.00000000125 seconds. Not a very long wait ;-) To make this number somewhat easier to read we'll convert it to nanoseconds (1 nanosecond is 1 billionth of a second). 0.00000000125 seconds x 1 billion = 1.25 ns (nanoseconds).

Now that we know how long a clockcycle takes we can calculate the real CAS Latency of our RAM in nanoseconds: CL9 in our case is 9 x 1.25 = 11.25 nanoseconds!

**2. DDR3 1333 CL7**

Now that we have calculated the CAS Latency for our DDR3 1600 CL9 we get to why CAS Latency can be so deceptive. DDR3 1333 runs at a clockspeed of 1333 / 2 = 666.5MHz. One clockcycle for this memory thus takes 1 / 666,500,000 seconds = 1.5 nanoseconds. A CAS Latency of 7 clockcycles for this RAM thus means a real CAS Latency of 7 x 1.5 = 10.5 ns!

So which RAM is fastest? You might be tempted to think that DDR3 1600 is faster than DDR3 1333 but this is not always the case! Every time the memory receives a read request for a specific memory location it takes the amount of time specified by the CAS Latency before actual data begins streaming from the DIMM module. In our example the 1333 memory does this significantly faster! Once a specific memory location is opened and data starts streaming, the datarate is what determines how fast all subsequent data from that location is sent. This obviously goes faster with the 1600 memory as opposed to the 1333 memory!

**The bottom line**

So again, which is fastest? The answer to this is: it depends. If an application reads a lot of different memory locations in a short amount of time the 1333 memory in the example will allow the application to run faster than the 1600 example. If an application needs to read a lot of subsequent memory locations starting from a specific location, the 1600 will be faster. In reality however, not many applications will benefit from the 1600 speed. Most will benefit from the lower CAS Latency on the 1333 memory. How applications behave is notoriously difficult to predict however.

In any case, like with all things hardware, there are no free rides. A lot of 1600 memory might seem cheaper than some 1333 memory but if you dive down to the real issues you are likely to find that the lower the actual CAS Latency, the higher the price will be :-)

**CPU Cache revisited**

Remember the previous article in which CPU cache size was mentioned? If not, flip back to the previous article and read up on that.

In essence, the previous post states that the larger the CPU cache, the less your CPU will need to access the main memory. Given what we have just learned on memory this means that the larger your CPU cache is, the less your memory data rate will matter. However, every time the CPU cache needs to read from your main memory, chances are good that it will need to read from a new memory location. CAS Latency is thus as important as it ever was!

**The breakdown**

* CAS Latency is the most important factor in memory performance a lot of the time.
* Memory datarate is important but CPU cache is even more important!

This is one of the reasons this subreddit agrees with people buying a Core i7 over a Core i5: The Core i7 has 30% more CPU cache and will perform better than the i5, even with hyperthreading turned off. Sometimes especially with hyperthreading turned off. There is more than 1 reason to buy an i7 over an i5 though, these reasons were detailed in the CPU part of the series, better die quality being one of them.


That's it for part 3 :-) Any questions / comments welcome!

Oh boy.... I'm gonna get my ass handed to me for posting this :-/ Nevertheless, I'm not one to shy away from the occasional beating ;-)
With the storm of negativity surround the launch of the Bulldozer CPUs I thought it only fair to highlight some areas in which these processors will offer advantages. 

__________________________________________

**A short list:**

* The memory controller on the FX processors is better than the one on the Phenom II processors. While it doesn't outrun Sandy Bridge it's not bad at all.

* The memory controller on the FX processors offers support for ECC memory (thanks *lazor*).

* The FX processors support a new set of instructions that will significantly speed up some types of calculations. Modifying game engines to make use of these instructions when available is 
***significantly easier*** than modifying the engine architecture to use multiple cores.

* You don't have to overclock the FX CPU to get great performance in Battlefield 3 (talking 8120 and 8150 here for the most part)

* The FX processors sacrifice some floating point performance in favor of performance in other areas. A lot of benchmarks use floating point calculations to determine speed and while floating point performance used to be an indicator, most of the real intensive floating point calculations in games are done on the GPU. If you take a look at the [Dhrystone and Whetstone benchmarks](http://www.guru3d.com/article/amd-fx-8150--8120-6100-and-4100-performance-review/3) you see that in these areas the FX81xx processors beat the i5 2500K by a significant margin.

* While using up a scary amount of power, they overclock higher and easier than current Phenom II processors.

* Most AMD 990X and 990FX based AM3+ boards offer very good value for money. Both are capable of both SLI and Crossfire and the 990FX supports dual x16/x16 graphics cards for an additional performance boost in games.

* 9 series chipsets offer IOMMU support (thanks again *lazor*)

__________________________________________

In the weeks preceding the Bulldozer launch I predicted the processors to have a better balance of performance where it's needed (for gaming). For the most part this turned out to be the case and - even though some of the figures were disappointing to me as well - I do think that as soon as prices drop a little particularly the FX 8120 is going to be a potentially very interesting choice in favor of either the X6 or the i5 processors.

Overclocking Basics - Part 5: Overclocking the video memory
--------------------------------------------------------------------

**The video memory revisited**

As mentioned in the previous article, it's hard to know exactly what specification of GDDR5 memory is on your videocard. A die-hard fanatic might take of the videocard's heatsink to find out but that goes a little beyond the scope of 'Overclocking Basics'. 

Also, because of the very different GPU architectures between Radeon and GeForce cards and the differences between the various GPUs of the same brand it's not possible to know exactly how much a higher memory clock will affect performance.

Also bear in mind that you are likely to hit a wall on the memory clocks far more quickly than you did with the GPU. In fact, there's a real possibility you won't get beyond stock frequencies. 

There is something more going on there though: unlike the DDR3 that comprises your PC's main memory (remember Dual Data Rate?) GDDR5 actually pumps through 4 bits of data in one clockcycle as opposed to 2. In other words, what seems like a small increase is actually a bigger increase than people give it credit for.

**The bottom line (again)**

First off, the warning (yes, I have to, sorry...) **Overclocking can damage your videocard and possibly other components. Proceed at your own risk!!**

The process I use for the videomemory is nearly identical to the GPU clock process:

* Start the temperature monitoring program and start watching the GPU temperatures again (yes, the GPU, it can possibly work harder now that the memory is running faster, also there is no temperature sensor on the memory but it will likely crash before it gets too warm anyway).

* Start the benchmarking program (Furmark).

* Increase the clocks, albeit in smaller steps this time. Let's say about 5MHz at a time.

* In Furmark, keep Fullscreen unchecked, select 1280x720 Resolution, 8x MSAA Alti-aliasing, Dynamic Background  &amp; Dynamic camera. This will heat up your GPU considerably!!! Heed the warning that the program gives you and remember you can wreck your GPU if you push it too hard or if you have bad luck.

* With the settings done click [BURN-IN test]. It will start testing in windowed mode so you can keep an eye on your GPU temperatures. My GPU can go up to 100C according to NVidia specs but to be honest I don't feel comfortable with that much heat. Here's where gut-feeling comes in, unfortunately. Personally I only feel slightly comfortable with under 90C and comfortable with under 80C but there's no rules for gut-feeling.

* See how much your temperatures shoot up. If you start to feel uncomfortable with it, stop the test and go no further.

* If it appears stable you can stop the BURN-IN. I usually don't let it run longer than 2 minutes.

* **Extra step for stability testing inserted here! Before proceeding it's wise to at least check your GPU stability with OCCT. OCCT is discussed in [Part 6 here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/jonvr/article_overclocking_basics_part_6_tools_for/). If you want to be thorough (always a good idea) run a VMT memory test as well, also discussed in part 6!**

* This time in FurMark, click the [Benchmark Preset: 720] Button. A fullscreen benchmark test will run for 1 minute. When it finishes your screen will go black for a second and then you will be returned to your desktop. FurMark will now have opened a pop-up window that shows your FurMark Score. Write this down.

Repeat the above steps (increase memory clock, run FurMark twice) until you start seeing diminishing returns from overclocking further (your benchmark score won't grow as much with 5MHz memory clock increase anymore). 

**At any time during BURN-IN or benchmark your computer may freeze!!! When it does, press the reset button quickly and revert to the previous clock setting (after reboot). You'll have found your memory clock limit!! If the computer doesn't freeze but you start seeing strange screen artifacts during either BURN-IN or benchmark, stop the test immediately!! In the fullscreen you can press Esc to stop it.**

Once you have found your stable maximum clock setting, start gaming for at least a few hours to see if your system is still stable during prolonged high load. 

**If the game freezes or crashes, also press the Reset button immediately! When rebooted reduce your overclock further and repeat.**

**One more warning, sorry for the repetitive warnings. This can damage your videocard and possibly other components! Do this at your own risk!**

**Questions, suggestions, comments &amp; corrections welcome!**

 (c) 2011, if you want to use this information on other places than this subreddit please contact the poster.

**Edit:** *a good point was made in the comments that FurMark isn't the end-all be-all of stress testing. Though I disagree with the alternative choice of stress test in that comment it did push me to scour the web once more for some additional tools. I've found 2 that I will discuss in the next post!*

----------------------------

This was a small budget system I built in 2011 for school and moderate gaming. It still works fine with most games today, but I recently added the GTX 660 because they were so well priced. 

I'm running both GPUs in the computer right now at the lane speed of PCI-e 2.0 8x/8x. If and only if I remove one of the cards will the other run at 16x speeds. This is to be expected. I've searched for information regarding the use of a 660 on PCI-e 2.0 8x and it bottlenecking, but the information I found was inconclusive. So, my first question is whether or not it's worth keeping the 560 in for PhysX based on the loss of lane speed incurred by having it attached. 

The main reason I'm keeping the 560 in there is for PhysX, as it makes some common sense that utilizing it for that might lessen the load on the 660. I haven't been able to prove this empirically. 

----------------------------------------------
So the question becomes... Which configuration is better? :

1) 1x GPU - GTX 660 @ PCI-e 2.0 16x w/ auto-select PhysX

2) 2x GPU - GTX 660/560 @ PCI-e 2.0 8x/8x w/ 560 dedicated PhysX

1358015076.0	16g2lg	Some warnings about Primochill coolant and pics of results. And also the EK SPIN reservoir.	Eschmacher	32	9	21	"Hey all,

After much research into my parts, I decided to use primochill LRT tubing and  primochill PC ICE coolant (UV blue). I heard many people say it would cause build-up and also many people that claimed they had been running it for a year with no problems.

I was optimistic when I bought it, hoping that mine would be fine. Nope.

[Here is an album of the results of using the PC ICE coolant for 2 months.](http://imgur.com/a/iErzk) As a side note, the tubing was the only thing affected. My water block, reservoir, pump and rads were fine.

I'm not saying that it is necessarily a bad coolant, my temps were such a vast improvement over my antec kuhler 620 that I didn't complain. I am warning you that it seems a majority of the people who have used this coolant end up with similar experiences. Which is quite disappointing especially since I used the same company's tubing; you would expect them to work well together.

I also want to warn you about the EK SPIN reservoir I had... I bought it because it looked cool. With the spinning wheel to show flow and such. Such a waste, looking cool is not everything when it comes to water cooling. The coolant enters through the bottom, up a tube that flows past the spinning disk, and shoots out the top, back into the reservoir chamber.

The problem with this is bubbles. My pump (mcp35x) was so fast even at low speeds, that the cascading water caused bubbles, which got sucked right back into the loop. When ever I started folding, the pump went to 100% and the problem was even worse.

I ended up replacing both the coolant and reservoir yesterday, with EKoolant (Blue) and an XSPC dual-bay res. 

Moral of the story is don't ignore the bad stuff you hear on forums, and cool-looking parts aren't everything. My new res was $30 cheaper and works way better. Temps are down 5 degrees Celsius with the new res and coolant.

Parts if anyone wants a list:

Pump: MCP35x

Rads: Black Ice 240 GT stealth and XSPC EX120

Res: XSPC Dual 5.25""

Waterblock: XSPC Raystorm


I'll post system specs if anyone asks.

**Edit: As quite a few people have pointed out, it appears that mostly the tubing is to blame. I knew I might get plasticizer issues, but I didn't expect them to appear within a week. The dye in my coolant ended up dyeing the plasticizer blue.**

**TL;DR: Just stay away from primochill in general.**"	t5_2sq2y	True

1347470937.0	zrwxu	So I'm trying my hand at overclocking. I started with my GPU yesterday; how's this so far?	Skyline969	31	7	30	"So I noticed that HIS (my Radeon HD7850 manufacturer) has their own application called iTurbo for overclocking their cards. I decided to give it a shot and see what I could do with it. I read on a forum that someone got their 7850 to like 1150 on the core and about 1250 on the memory, so I tried that right off the bat. Yeah... not gonna do that again. I heard a **POP** but nothing seemed to be affected, and as of yet I'm unsure of whether or not it was my PC that actually made that sound.

Anyway, I decided to just go in 50Mhz increments on the core (memory proved to be unstable even with a slight overclock). After messing around with it for a good hour or two, I managed to get the core clock from 860MHz to 1024MHz, leaving the memory clock at 1200MHz. Is this good for that card, and will it cause any damage to leave it at that 24/7? At high load (ran the Furmark burn-in twice, so 30 minutes at max load) the temp only got to around 72C. I noticed a ~5FPS increase in Guild Wars 2, and I no longer get random FPS drops.

I understand that MSI Afterburner seems to be the go-to for overclocking AMD cards, but iTurbo seems to do the trick. I'm not sure if Afterburner does this, but iTurbo will automatically reload my config and apply the overclock to my GPU when my computer starts up again. Would there be any benefit to using Afterburner as opposed to iTurbo?"	t5_2sq2y	True

1333035622.0	rjcnq	r/gamingpc, let's talk air cooling; fan placement, fan control, best fan and fan brands, etc		31	5	15	"I was wondering what people's opinions were on topics related to air cooling a system.

**Fan Placement**  
While they were using a much older case and neglected to try out various other fan configurations, [this article](http://icrontic.com/article/pc_airflow_heat_cooling_guide) is very interesting because it suggests that running a system purely with exhausting fans at negative pressure will be superior to any other fan configuration. Thoughts? The case used in the experiment didn't have a bottom fan slot and the top-mounted PSU made the top fan and rear fan slots be in a funky position, but they are more or less close to what they would be in modern cases. It also seems like the side fan position is pretty useless as it disrupts flow within the case. Granted, you're better cooling the GPU but at the cost of disrupting flow cooling the rest of the components.
  
  
**Fan Control**  
Some of you just run fans at 100% off the PSU, some at 100% off the motherboard, some of your motherboards might allow for a more intelligent speed control and there is the option of using an external fan control. Finally there are options like [this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=11-995-075) that let you automatically run case fans off the CPU_FAN PWM signal on the motherboard. Personally, I'd prefer a solution that is as thoughless and automatic as possible in order to cut down on unnecessary noise, but this isn't always possible depending on number of fans and the motherboard involved. Thoughts?
  
  
**Fan Brands/Fans Themselves**  
What fans offer the best combination of CFM and noise levels for each price range (&lt;$10, $10-25, &gt;$25)? Anyone have positive experiences using fans that are not normally regarded as a quality brand?

1331163950.0	qmhfm	Why I will never order any high-end PC gaming products from BenQ ever again. An angry warning.	pahncrd	31	6	22	"Well, I won't be using the benq store ever again. After being told by a representative that my order was in stock (a 3d vision monitor xl2420tx ,the version that comes with 3dvision 2 glasses), it turns out that days later I am told it is not and will not be in stock until ""maybe"" mid April. 

In addition, now that I know that, the other sku that was in stock (xl2420tx with the 3dvision 1 glasses) is now out of stock. So now I am double-dip screwed by them. The customer service is awful and I was basically called a liar by the last representative I spoke to.

When I originally made my order, there were two skus for the monitor I wanted.  

It seemed strange that one of the skus would be in stock and the other was on per-order, so I checked with their customer service to see if the product I wanted was in stock.  It was verified to me that it was and I should have it shipped within a couple of days.  If I had known that was a lie, I would have switched to the other sku.  

In addition the the original confusion, my order was under review for for several days.  The first time I checked with customer service, they said everything was fine.  After another day went by without change, I contacted them again only to be told that my address needed to be verified.  I was then told that my order would be processed and shipped within a day or two.  

So after two days of merely processing, I checked back with customer service again, just to be finally told my order wouldn't be in stock for at least a month and a half, and furthermore was all but called a liar by the snarky representative.

I won't ever be using BenQ's online store again, and I urge others to weigh my experiences before ordering from them.  I know many of you would hate to be in my shoes, having to wait a month and a half for a high-end monitor that should have been delivered in a day or two.  So hopefully this causes people to be cautious so that they don't go trusting customer service at the BenQ Qshop.

I'm thinking of RMAing my GPU, but I wanted a little insight first. First off, I'm NOT overclocking or adjusting the voltage at the moment. Everything is at stock in EVGA Precision X, including the fan curve just for testing's sake. For the past few weeks I've been getting random game crashes, both on graphically intensive games (ex. Far Cry 3) and not-so-intense games (ex. Chivalry: Medieval Warfare). Earlier I ran FC3 and it was going at 20FPS for some reason. I restarted the game and it was fine after that, but I'm worried. I haven't noticed any artifacting, but I do get game crashes, although it's not the display driver crashing, just the game itself. 

Also, my idle temps seem really high for a 680. With the stock fan curve, I'm idling at 50-55C, which seems high to me. At load, I'm usually like 75-80C, which doesn't seem too bad to me, but the idle temps seem really high to me. I can get them lower with a more aggressive fan curve, but does that seem high to you guys? I've seen posts online about others' idle temps being 25-35C.  I have removed the GPU from my case completely and gone at it with air duster pretty thoroughly, so I don't think dust is my issue, here. Also, my house stays fairly cool. The room it's in never gets above 70F/21C.

Edit: I'm running the latest drivers as well, forgot to mention. 314.07

Prices are a but off since I live in Aus and my monitors were much cheaper than that. 

**Watercooling Gear -**

XSPC Raystorm CPU Block

2x XSPC Rasa GPU Block

Bitspower Fittings

XSPC EX240 Radiator

Phobya Xtreme 200 Radiator

XSPC Dual Bay DDC Reservoir

Laing DDC Pump

Primochill LRT white tubing.

The watercooling gear all up cost me just over $900 :/ but it was great fun putting it all together so that makes up for it.

The temperature differences are amazing. Playing BF3 with my old 212 Evo put my CPU at about 70C and GPUs between 70 and 80C. I increased the CPU to 4.8GHz and battlefield never gets it above 50 and the GPUs never go above 40. Everything Idles around 28C.

And a big thanks goes out to Canarka who was very patient with my hundred and one questions about his set up which is similar to mine, couldn't have done it without him ;)

Thanks too to my brother who helped with the metalwork and name suggestion."	t5_2sq2y	True

I am keeping it clocked at 3.9GHz right now because I really haven't had a lot of time to play with it this week. I ran it all the way up to 4.4GHz and it started to get buggy and I ran out of time to fiddle with it...  It does run completely stable at 3.9GHz (using AMD Overdrive...how sweet is that application? Awesome...)  and the H60 keeps it nice and cool. Haven't seen a temp above 50C yet. The H60 works pretty well for how inexpensive it is and how easy it is to install.

This is the first gaming build I have done in a few years and it was a lot of fun. I actually got the CPU and motherboard for free from work. We had to test some encryption/recording software on the Bulldozer. I picked out the motherboard and the CPU with the idea that I would take them home and put together a PC after the project was completed. I know there are a lot of Intel fans here on r/gamingpc, but this new AMD chip is very very impressive. And for the price it is really kind of amazing. I am running Windows 7 right now but I am going to put Ubuntu on to play with eventually. 

This has just been a ton of fun. I got a lot of help from [/r/gamingpc](/r/gamingpc) and [/r/buildapc](/r/buildapc). Thanks so much.
