Then a louder knock follows. ""Aren't you going to answer that?"" says his wife. So he drags himself out of bed and goes downstairs. He opens the door and there is a man standing on the porch. It didn't take the homeowner long to realize the man was drunk. 

""Hi there,"" slurs the stranger. ""Can you give me a push??"" 

""No, get lost! It's half past three. I was in bed,"" says the man and he slams the door. He goes back up to bed and tells his wife what happened and she says, ""That wasn't very nice of you. Remember that night we broke down in the pouring rain on the way to pick the kids up from the babysitter and you had to knock on that man's house to get us started again? What would have happened if he'd told us to get lost?"" 

""But the guy was drunk,"" says the husband. ""It doesn't matter,"" says the wife. ""He needs our help and it would be the Christian thing to help him.""

So the husband gets out of bed again, gets dressed, and goes downstairs. He opens the front door, and not being able to see the stranger anywhere he shouts, ""Hey, do you still want a push?"" And he hears a voice cry out, ""Yeah, please."" So, still being unable to see the stranger he shouts, ""Where are you?""

Sometime in the middle of the night Holmes woke Watson up and said: ""Watson, look up at the stars, and tell me what you see."" Watson replied: ""I see millions and millions of stars."" Holmes said: ""And what do you deduce from that?"" Watson replied: ""Well, if there are millions of stars, and if even a few of those have planets, it's quite likely there are some planets like Earth out there. And if there are a few planets like Earth out there, there might also be life."" And Holmes said: ""Watson, you idiot, it means that somebody stole our tent."" "" by DevastatorIIC.

Number 4: ""A man is in bed with his wife when there is a knock at the door. He rolls over and looks at his clock, and it's 3:30 in the morning. ""I'm not getting out of bed at this time,"" he thinks, and rolls over.

Then a louder knock follows. ""Aren't you going to answer that?"" says his wife. So he drags himself out of bed and goes downstairs. He opens the door and there is a man standing on the porch. It didn't take the homeowner long to realize the man was drunk.

""Hi there,"" slurs the stranger. ""Can you give me a push??""

""No, get lost! It's half past three. I was in bed,"" says the man and he slams the door. He goes back up to bed and tells his wife what happened and she says, ""That wasn't very nice of you. Remember that night we broke down in the pouring rain on the way to pick the kids up from the babysitter and you had to knock on that man's house to get us started again? What would have happened if he'd told us to get lost?""

""But the guy was drunk,"" says the husband. ""It doesn't matter,"" says the wife. ""He needs our help and it would be the Christian thing to help him.""

So the husband gets out of bed again, gets dressed, and goes downstairs. He opens the front door, and not being able to see the stranger anywhere he shouts, ""Hey, do you still want a push?"" And he hears a voice cry out, ""Yeah, please."" So, still being unable to see the stranger he shouts, ""Where are you?""

And the drunk replies, ""Over here, on the swing."" "" by kreimerd, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cleanjokes/comments/zvztv/late_night_visitor/)

Number 3: "" What's in a name? Do you remember the famous Olympic skier Picabo Street (pronounced Pee-Ka-Boo) Well, Picabo is not just an athlete. She is now a nurse currently working at an Intensive Care Unit of a large metropolitan hospital. She is not permitted to answer the hospital telephones any longer. It caused too much confusion when she would answer the phone and say, Picabo, I.C.U."" by cancercankissourass, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cleanjokes/comments/12m5zn/my_dad_emailed_me_this_one_i_got_a_good_chuckle/)

He starts putting the pedal down as he gets out into the rural areas, just having a blast. His fuel starts running a bit low so he pulls into an old gas station. An older fellow wearing faded jeans and a blue shirt with the gas station logo comes over to the side of the car.

""What'll it be?"" he says, hooking his fingers into his suspenders.

""Premium, and fill 'er up,"" says the young man.

The gas station attendant, himself a petrol-head, admires the car and as he begins filling up the tank, he says ""This sure does look fast, but I'll bet ole Bessie's faster."" He jerks a thumb toward a bright blue Charger. ""I'll tell you what,"" he continues, ""I'll let you have this tank of gas on the house if you can beat me to the county line.""

The kid mulls the offer over a bit. ""A race? What if I lose?""

""You pay double the cost of the tank of gas. And tell you what, I'll even give you a head start. Soon as I finish pumping, you take off. First one to the county line wins, if you get there first, just keep going.""

""OK!"" The kid was excited at the prospect of not only getting to put his car through its paces, but getting a freebie out of the bargain as well.

The old fellow drew the nozzle out, replaced the gas cap and slapped the fuel cover closed. The kid floored it out of the gas station. At first he didn't see anything behind him because of the dust. But as the dust cleared, he saw this tiny blue dot way back in the distance in his rear view mirror. The tiny dot began growing and growing and rapidly blurred past him. It was unbeliveably quick. He squinted and looked forward and could see way off ahead of him a tiny blue dot. It began growing and growing and again blurred past him at amazing speed until it was a tiny dot in the rearview mirror again. Once more the blue blur overtook him, but the kid realized he was approaching the county line and began to hit the brakes. Incredibly as he came to a stop at the county line, he saw the older fellow from the gas station laying in the middle of the road just ahead. He was covered in dirt and cuts and bruises.

The kid was stunned. The old guy had beat him. ""That was amazing! But what happened to you? Where's your car?""

The old fellow stared up in horror at the kid, ""Car nothing! My suspenders got hooked to your bumper!""

At the end of their final song, there is a large cymbal crash, and the percussionists always miss it.  Angered, the director asks why.  ""There simply aren't enough percussionists to cover all of these parts.  No one can get to it in time.""  Frustrated, the director walks out of the hall and finds a homeless man.  He offers the man some money in return for playing this one cymbal crash at the end of the concert.  The homeless man agrees and follows the director back into the hall.  They run the tune one more time, and the homeless man does great!  Satisfied, the director lets everyone go home for the night.  

On the night of the concert, the director is anxiously directing his orchestra, and he gives the cue for the big cymbal crash at the end.  The homeless man misses it.  The director, who is now furious, rages through the orchestra and kills the man.  The police come and take the director to prison, and he is sentenced to death.

On his final night in prison, the guard asks the man what he wants as his last meal.  He replies, ""I would love 10,000 pounds of bananas.""  The guard, though puzzled, complies and brings him 10,000 pounds of bananas.

On the day of his execution, the man is lead to the electric chair.  After the first shock, he does not die.  After the second shock, he still doesn't die.  After the third shock, he still doesn't die!  So the guards release him.  The guard, puzzled by this asks the man if he knew something they didn't about having so many bananas in your system.  The man replies, ""No, I guess I'm just a bad conductor.""

He soon meets the native inhabitants, short blue people, called Trids. As he explores the island he becomes aware of Trids flying through the air overhead, landing on the far beach, and migrating back towards the direction they had come from. The curious rabbi follows them, and finds a hill on the opposite shore. Atop the hill there is a giant, who the Trids line up in front of to be kicked across the island. They seem to be doing this all day every day, and actually seem to be enjoying it. The rabbi, not wanting to miss out on the fun, gets in line with them. When its his turn, however, the Trid behind him steps forward and is kicked instead. After this happens a few times, the rabbi begins to be upset, and asks the giant why he won't kick him, to which the giant responds, ""Silly rabbi, kicks are for Trids."""	t5_2ucq2	True

Seeing he has got the librarians attention, he says 'Book! Book! Book!'
The librarian complies and puts a few books down. The chicken takes them and leaves.
The next day, the librarian looks up to find the same chicken handing back the pile of books. 'Book! Book! Book!' says the chicken. The librarian takes the books and hands the chicken a few more. The chicken takes them and leaves.
The next day, the librarian looks up once again to find the chicken handing back the second pile of books. 'Book! Book! Book!' says the chicken. The librarian shakes his head and hands him yet another pile of books. The chicken takes them and leaves.
Wondering what the chicken could possibly want so many books for, the librarian decides to follow the chicken home. Through the carpark, down several roads, and finally into a large park; the chicken disappears into a small grove of trees, and the librarian follows.
On the other side of the trees is a small pond. The chicken stops at the side of the pond, and there he hands the books to a frog.
The frog picks each book up in turn, looking at the titles, saying 'reddit... reddit... reddit....'

For 12 years I didn't know why. For 12 years I didn't know what was there. But not long after my 12th birthday, my parents weren't around. They weren't in the kitchen. Not in their bedroom. Couldn't find them in living room. I walked to the cellar door. If they weren't anywhere else, they must be here. And if they're one the other side of the door, I'm going there too.

I reached for the doorknob. 12 years of warnings flowed through my mind as I turned and pulled.

I saw things. Wonderful things.

I also like to milk jokes (drag them out a little longer than you would expect) so prepare for the cheese. There's a little flexibility in how you tell these jokes, and if you have any other jokes about jungle animals you can mix them in, but some of the order is very important (especially the first and las jokes).

Here is my preferred order:

Q. How do you put an elephant in the refrigerator?  
A. Open the door, put the elephant in, and close the door. 


Q. How do you put a tiger in the refrigerator?  
A. Open the door, take the elephant out, put the tiger in, and close the door. 


Q. Why did the monkey fall out of the tree?  
A. It was dead. 


Q. Why did a second monkey fall out of the tree?  
A. It was stapled to the first monkey. 


Q. Why did a third monkey fall out of the tree?  
A. It was taped to the second monkey. 


Q. Why did ANOTHER monkey fall out of the tree?  
A. Peer pressure. 


Q. What do an apple and an elephant have in common?  
A. They're both red... except for the elephant. (I like to say the first part, then wait a beat before the second part) 


Q. What's the difference between an elephant and a plum?  
A. Their color! 


Q. What did Tarzan say when he saw the elephants coming through the jungle?  
A. Look! Here come the elephants! 


Q. What did Jane say when she saw the elephants coming through the jungle?  
A. Look! Here come the plums. ... She's colorblind! 


Q. There's a big meeting in the jungle and all the animals come, except for one. Which one and why?  
A. The tiger! You left him in the refrigerator! 


One last note - you can mix it up if people guess an answer that's a little too close. So for the monkey joke, if somebody guesses tape or something stupid after the stapler comment, go deadpan and say ""No, peer pressure."" Just one example. Enjoy and have fun!"	t5_2ucq2	True

Our teacher asked what my favorite animal was, and I said, ""Fried chicken.""
 
She said I wasn't funny, but she couldn't have been right, because everyone else laughed.
 
My parents told me to always tell the truth. I did. Fried chicken is my favorite animal.
 
I told my dad what happened, and he said my teacher was probably a member of PETA. He said they love animals very much.
 
I do, too. Especially chicken, pork and beef. Anyway, my teacher sent me to the principal's office. . . . I told him what happened, and he laughed, too. Then he told me not to do it again.
 The next day in class my teacher asked me what my favorite live animal was. 

I told her it was chicken. She asked me why, so I told her it was because you could make them into fried chicken.
 
She sent me back to the principal's office. He laughed, and told me not to do it again.
 
I don't understand. My parents taught me to be honest, but my teacher doesn't like it when I am.
 Today, my teacher asked me to tell her what famous person I admired most. 

I told her, ""Colonel Sanders."" Guess where I am now?

Its called the cheerio joke.  
-------------------------------------  
So there is this land called cheerio land and in cheerio land there are 7 classes of cheerio, 0-5 and the frosted cheerios. Now there is this level 0 cheerio. Hes homeless, living out on the street, probaly an alchoholic. But he falls in love with a frosted cheerio princess. So one day he sneaks into the royal gala and goes up to the princess and asks her ""will you marry me?"" Now she says ""I like your style, youre a good looking guy, a bit scruffy but I like you. Tell you what I will marry you if you can become a frosted cheerio"" So our guy goes back with a determination and gets a job and starts to pay off his debts. Now by having a job and his debts paid he becomes a level 1 cheerio. So he works, and he works, and he works, and he WORKS and he finally becomes a level 2 cheerio. Now he goes back to the princess and askes her again, ""will you marry me?"" she says ""no honey you really do have to become a frosted cheerio first."" So he goes back and he works and works, hes a fryboy at McGrubers or something, I dont care. So he works and he works and he gets promoted at the restraunt and is making more money. And he works and he works and he works and by having that income raise he finally becomes a level 3 cheerio. He feels sucessful for the first time in his life but he is starting to fall back on his old ways. One day he goes to the casino and he loses and he loses and he loses and he gambled all his money away and he gets fired to boot because gambling is against company policy. So he is back down to a level 1 cheerio. He gets a job on a production line at a nearby factory and determines himself not to fall back ever again. So he works and he works and he works and he works and he WORKS, level 2, level 3, and he is doing great again. He is promoted to Floor manager of the factory and he is doing great and becomes a level 4 cheerio. But then one day a rival company sabotages their operation by putting poison in their toothpaste or whatever the hell they were making. They have to pay out damages and PR and the like and they declare bankruptcy. He is knocked back down to level 2 for the lack in income. But he is hired almost straight away by a branch of a huge conglomerate because they recognized how hard of a worker he is. So he works, level 3, works, level 4, and he works and works and WORKS. So he is promoted to CEO of the branch that he works in. A few months pass and he is approaching level 5 status when the Head of the entire conglomerate decides to retire. He weighs his options for his replacement and sees our guy and what a hard worker he is and chooses him as his replacement. So our guy is now the CEO of a huge company, a level 5 cheerio and making Bill Gates level money and he finally becomes a Frosted Cheerio. So he goes to the princess and asks her again, ""will you marry me?"" and she says ""Yes I will marry you now."" So a few months pass and theyre at the wedding recption, they allready said their vows and the party is winding down. The newlywed wife tells her husband ""Hey I'm thirsty, can you go over to the bar and get me a Gin and Tonic or something?"" So the dutiful guy he is he went over to the bar and low and behold the bartender wasnt there. So he waits and he waits and he waits and he waits 15 minutes and the bartender still hadnt shown up so he decided he must have gone home since the party was winding down. So he went back to his wife and tells her the bartender wasnt there, can I get you something else? she replies: ""Ok, its fine. Here take this dollar and go buy me a Diet Coke at the vending machine in the lobby. So he goes to get it and theres a line for the machine. It was the princesses wedding so obviously a lot of people would show up. So he waits and he waits and he waits in line and he finally gets up to the machine only to find that the prices were hiked because they knew they could gouge them. So he goes back to his wife gets another dollar and waits and waits and WAITS in lineonly to find once he finally reached the front that they were out of Diet Coke. So he buys a regular Coke instead and takes it to his wife. She throws it away saying she needs to keep her figure yadda, yadda, yadda. So she tells him to get a cup off the table and get her some water from the cooler. So he goes over there and there is a line there too so he waits and he waits and he waits in line and the cooler runs out of water 5 people ahead of him. So exasperated he goes back to his wife and tells her, look there out of water is there any other source of liquid in this damn place. So she tells him ""screw it, just to go get some punch from the punch bowl."" So he leaves, gets the punch, and comes back within a minute. She says ""wow, that was fast. What happened? How did you get it so fast?"" and he replies ""Well it was a short wait because there was no punchline."""	t5_2ucq2	True
