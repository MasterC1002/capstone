1362116458.0	19g4us	Free Milk on Amazon Prime	HopwoodInternational	57	16	26	"Yes... this one is a little bit different.

But some of you who have seen my posts before know I like testing out different products and r/primefreebies is a great way to do it. You get something free and I get honest feedback. 

So here is what I'm throwing up as a test product now. Believe it or not... milk. This is shelf stable milk and to the average American it seems a little odd. We are so used to getting our milk from the local dairy any other option seems weird but believe it or not half the world buys their milk this way. It's ultra-pasteurized which means it actually uses a process that is more intense than the standard pasteurization we are used to in most of the US.  

I won't lie to you. It does taste a little different when you first try it. I've been drinking for about a month to see what I think and now I don't notice anything different about it. I don't know if this is a product Americans would ever adopt but I'm going to try it out. 

So, if you'd like to try this out go to** [this product](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B7UXX9W)** and add the milk to your cart. Use the promo code **FREEMILK** and it will reduce the cost to $0.0. All I ask of you is to write an honest review on the milk after you've given it a try. This is not a bribe for 5 star reviews. I want real feedback so if I do start selling this as a regular product I know what customers think.

BTW... the price of $9.99 is not what I'd actually sell a quart for. These are small test batches. You'd probably get a half gallon for $8.99 and a full gallon for 13.99. I'm still playing with the prices as well as a subscription option. If you have any thoughts on those two things please let me know as well. Would you buy this as a subscription product and what would you pay for regular delivery of a gallon or a half gallon?

I'll be monitoring how quickly the stock moves and I will end this promo after a bunch of people have redeemed it. 

EDIT: The free promo will be ending in the next couple of hours as a lot of people have taken advantage and we are quickly running out of stock. I'm actually pretty surprised how many people wanted it. I mean I know it's free and all so why not but the milk is going fast. Grab it before all the stock is gone."	t5_2t9yp	True

1359386451.0	17fjfi	The #1 Bestselling Educator Memoir 'Schooled: How the System Breaks Teachers' is Free for Prime Members who own Kindles.  I'm also doing an AMAA in /r/books on February 7th.	Deradius	33	6	6	"The book is about my two year experience teaching high school in the rural southern US.  Through a series of short vignettes, it covers the stratospheric highs and abysmal depths experienced by one early career high school teacher.  In my (biased) opinion, it also lends insight into why 50% of new teachers quit.

The book covers everything from threats of false sexual harassment allegations to threats of physical harm, and hits some high points in between.

[Here's a direct link to the Amazon page for the book.](http://www.amazon.com/Schooled-ebook/dp/B007TPZ7XO)

As mentioned in the title, I'll be doing an AMAA in /r/books at 11AM on February 7th, 2013.

You guys are probably all up to speed, but just in case, [here's how to sign up for a free trial through Prime](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200444170) and [here's how to borrow books from the Kindle Owners' Lending Library](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_200757120_borrow?nodeId=200757120#borrow).

I'm super excited because just this morning I found out it hit [#1 best selling education memoir](http://imgur.com/OSCd77B).  That's a pretty specific subcategory, but I'm still thrilled.

I've also priced it at 99 cents, so in the event that anyone's Prime membership has recently lapsed or you want to recommend it to friends who don't have Prime, it hopefully won't break the bank.

1359434722.0	17h8t8	Free Page by Page Lamp With Code (Limited to 10)	HopwoodInternational	30	8	32	"**PROMO LIMIT REACHED (OVER)**

Recently I gave away a bunch of [iPhone 5 cases](http://www.reddit.com/r/PrimeFreebies/comments/178o96/free_iphone_5_case_with_code/) here on Prime Freebies to help launch my new business. This time I will be giving away 10 [Page by Page Lamps](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B0PA59U) to the first takers. 

I will hand out the codes on a first come first serve basis. Just post your desire to have one. I will be monitoring this thread for the next couple of hours and will stop when the codes run out or when I have to go to bed. The only thing I ask in return is that once you receive the lamp you write an honest review of it. This is not a bribe for 5 star feedback. I only want honest reviews so if you think it's a 3 star product say why you think it is, etc. Amazon does this themselves with their Vine program and in a sense my product reviewers. 

I'm doing this as a way to jump-start certain products I'll be selling more of in the future and I also like to make people happy with free giveaways. I pasted a description of the lamp below which was a response to a question about it. 

--- ---
The lamp is basically a notebook with each page being fairly thick. There are a number of pages you can flip through which each have a different printed image and in the top center is a pop out LED which gives it a 3D feeling rather than just paper. You plug it in and it gives off a nice soft light. In addition to the pre-printed pages there are blank pages so you can draw your own image in there if you want. It's USB so it's low voltage and can plug into anything or you can plug it into a wall with an adapter. I used the same adapter from my iPhone charger and then bought one with my prime membership (from Best Deals USA I think) for 1.50 to try that as well. Both worked fine. That's about all I can think of. I just put these up for a sale a few days ago but I've had them for a few weeks. I like it because I have my hanging on the wall and it's the first thing people go look at. It always makes people smile as they flip through the pages.

The first two are the Novellas:

[The Alchemist and the Wizard](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Alchemist-Wizard-ebook/dp/B009V30304/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358203824&amp;sr=1-1) A story of two men, one as stubborn as the other, whose egos land them in serious trouble.

[Love and Lycanthrope](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Love-and-Lycanthrope-ebook/dp/B008L2V6UM/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358204725&amp;sr=8-1-spell) A classic romcom: boy and his friends travel to a strange new town, boy meets girl, boy falls for girl, boy's friend slaughtered by werewolf, boy not so sure anymore...

The others are short stories, designed to be read in one sitting:

[The Battlemage](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Battlemage-ebook/dp/B00AXBMN2O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358205019&amp;sr=8-1) A battlemage investigates the disappearance of a powerful wizard. He senses dark forces at work, but is the wizard he is looking for a victim, or the perpetrator?

[Manic Snake Venom](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Manic-Snake-Venom-ebook/dp/B00AXCJSPS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358205099&amp;sr=8-1) A young accountant, leading a life which bores him to tears, finds himself in possession of enough narcotics to send him to prison for life.

[The Head Vampire](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Head-Vampire-ebook/dp/B006KER1MK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358205396&amp;sr=8-1) Roland Erhoff, a human journalist at a newspaper for vampires finds himself getting some attention from the higher-ups in the vampire community, attention he REALLY doesn't want.

I hope you all enjoy these, and I'd be eternally grateful to anyone who takes the time to write a review.
