1359414192.0	17ghyu	The Difference between Reishi, Reiryoku and Reiatsu	Andygoesrawr	171	17	26	"Hi everyone :)

I've noticed recently that a LOT of people have been confusing Reishi, Reiryoku and Reiatsu, and sometimes using Reiatsu as a catchall term for all three. I thought that I better make a post about the difference between the three, and provide examples for them.

---

##Reishi
Reishi means ""spirit particles"". Reishi is the thing which objects are made of inside Soul Society and Hueco Mundo. There's also Reishi in the World of the Living, but concentrations are much lower than in the two spiritual worlds.

Reishi is essentially the same as Kishi, which is what objects in the World of the Living are made of. Kishi is a catchall term for atoms in reality. As a result, Reishi most likely has a wide array of elements which make up the term ""Reishi"" (as in hydrogen, oxygen, sodium, etc).

**Who Uses Reishi**

Reishi is what Quincies use for all of their techniques. They tear the Reishi out of the environment and combine them with their own Reiryoku to shape it in a certain way. They use their cross as a sort of focal point for the Reishi to easily combine with their Reiryoku, and then be shaped into a weapon. They then shape Reishi with their Reiryoku to create arrows (Heilig Pfeil).
######Quincies can also combine Reishi with their Reiryoku inside their veins to boost their natural abilities (Blut Vene/Arterie).

**Examples of Reishi**
Buildings in Soul Society, sand in Hueco Mundo, Hollow bodies, Plus bodies, Shinigami bodies, Zanpakuto, Quincy weapons (not crosses - they are made of Kishi), etc.

---

##Reiryoku

Reiryoku means ""spiritual power"" but also relates to ""spiritual energy"". Reiryoku is the thing which Quincies combine with Reishi to create things, and also the thing which Shinigami channel though their Zanpakuto in Shikai to create attacks. All Spiritual beings have a certain amount of Reiryoku, but also a certain amount of ""potential"" Reiryoku. Every race (Hollows, Shinigami, and their subraces) has a maximum amount of Reiryoku possible. That amount is more than three times the level of a Captain-class Shinigami, and is most likely the same for all races. This is the reason why Aizen and Urahara wanted to break the barrier between Hollow and Shinigami, as doing so allows for a potential maximum of four times the regular limit.

This is the reason why Ichigo absorbed all of Rukia's Reiryoku when she stabbed him. Her potential maximum is MUCH lower than Ichigo's potential maximum (which is possibly the overall maximum). This is also why he was much weaker when he originally became a Shinigami, and why he was able to have a sealed sword, as opposed to when he gained his powers naturally. Zaraki also has Reiryoku near the Shinigami limit.

It's worth noting that Reiryoku and Reiatsu are closely related. If somebody has a huge Reiryoku pool, they generally have higher Reiatsu. However, Reiatsu (which is essentially Reiryoku output) can be controlled (read: lowered) by somebody with skill.

**Who Uses Reiryoku**

Pretty much everybody. All spiritual beings anyway.

* Quincies use it to shape the Reishi that they tear from the environment
* Shinigami channel it through their Zanpakuto in Shikai to create attacks. They also shape it in a certain way to use Kido.
* Hollows/Arrancar condense it to create Cero.
* Don Kanonji uses it to create his Kan'onball.

**Examples of Reiryoku**

Heilig Pfeil (partially), Cero, Kido, Getsuga Tensho, Santen Kesshun, etc.

---

##Reiatsu

Reiatsu means ""spiritual pressure"". Reiatsu, like Reiryoku, is slightly ambiguous. While it directly translates as pressure, it's often used interchangeably with the concept of ""spiritual energy"", and as a result, Reiryoku. Like I said in the Reiryoku section, Reiatsu and Reiryoku are closely related, but not quite the same.

EDIT: /u/WaterISThirsty explains it best:

&gt; I'm pretty sure that Reiatsu is created through the pressure difference between two bodies with spiritual energy.

&gt; Meaning that by manipulating and/or cutting off your reiryoku emission you can effectively lower your reiatsu because less flow of energy is coming from you body, this can also have the opposite effect, letting more flow out creates a higher pressure difference between you and other bodies of spiritual pressure. This is also why people can ""sense"" reiatsu, they are literally feeling the pressure of someone else's reiryoku output.

&gt;**TL:DR** Think air pressure in the atmosphere!

1371375107.0	1gg47o	Why Bankai can't 'heal'	Deserak	164	16	45	"Just occurred to me, and I'm sure I'm not the only one to realize this but I thought I'd share because it's interesting.

We know that Asauchi can ""become anything"" but after they become a true Zanpaktou they stay as they are for ever - they might evolve, but a zanpaktou never becomes a different zanpaktou, etc. So picture it this way - the Asauchi is the core, and the shikai + sealed state are just extra layers that form on top of that. Those layers shield the Asauchi from being damaged in battle, at the cost of restricting how much of it's power can get out.

So, releasing to Shikai opens up the zanpaktou enough to use it's powers without risking permanent damage - the seal is still up protecting the Asauchi but a partial reflection of the shinigami's power is being let through. Then going bankai removes the shell entirely, and allows the zanpaktou to be used uninhibited as a perfect reflection of the shinigami's power, as the cost of risking permanent damage.

Damage to the shell in shikai or sealed state can be easily mended, damage to the Asauchi core is permanent, and can only be repaired by taking a new Asauchi and reforging it from scratch - even when regressing from bankai to shikai, the damage is still there it's just no longer visible. 

So thats why Bankai usually takes decades to achieve - the zanpaktou spirit has to trust the shinigami utterly, in order to be willing to expose themselves to injury like that - meanwhile the urahara method allows the shinigami to just beat the spirit into submission so they'll do it anyway. Also explains why the older captains are often less quick to resort to bankai, they have a strong bond with their zanpaktou spirits and understand the risk bankai involves, so they save it for when they need it. Meanwhile the younger captains generally regard bankai as just a powerup/ultimate attack and don't really think much about using it beyond that (Even if they know the risk involved to their zanpaktou, they probably don't really understand it).

Komamura's 'exception' to the rule also fits - a unique trait of his bankai is that the damage it takes is reflected on his own body and vice versa. So technically the bankai itself never takes damage, it just continues to accurately mimic Komamura's body, and that loophole allows it to seemingly heal itself where most bankai would be down permanently."	t5_2rk7q	True

1350533382.0	11o8f2	My theory on Isshin, Masaki &amp; the Royal Guard	JustForLinks	158	19	81	"We know that at some point in time, Isshin was a soul reaper and at least captain class. When we compare the fights against Aizen, we see Isshin could deal with Aizen a lot better than most other captains (no bankai, was not getting throw around as much). We also know that he is essentially banished from Soul Society (not being able to go back, not being able to show himself to the other captains), but was not banished under the Kurosaki name. We know this because none of the captains have any reaction to the name Kurosaki. 



This leads me to believe that Kurosaki is an alias (Possibly a mix between Isshin's previous name and Masaki's name. Also possible that its a mix between Kuro (Japanese for black) and Masaki, remember this one it's important.)



What if Isshin was a royal guard, assigned to protect Masaki, a member of the Royal family and they eloped together to the human world. Obviously without the blessing of the spirit king, they took a new name (Kurosaki, black masaki, as in Masaki is a black mark on the royal families bloodline, bringing shame and dishonor for running off.)



Now, with the new information that has come out recently (on the front page of this sub reddit, i believe its called ""tons of info in this blog"" or something like that, Kubo hints that Masaki was maybe not killed by the Grand Fisher. The Grand Fisher might of just finished her off when she was injured and the Royal Family sent an Assassin to kill her, trying to redeem their honor. 

However, that makes Ichigo, Karin and Yuzu royal as well. I think that there has a Royal Guard watching Ichigo since he was a child and that person is Mizurio Kojima. 



Kojima has always been the one friend that we have never really explored to deeply. He is also the only friend that we have never seen in trouble or fight along side someone else. This is because he is 
a) Strong
b) Not interested in anything other than Ichigo / Karin and Yuzu's saftey. 



Some other reasons i can see him as a royal guard sent to watch over Ichigo, he is frequently shown on his phone. We constantly see an association between mobile phones and Soul Society. It's how they communicate and gather intel on hollows in the area. We even get an explanation by Urahara that they use phones as tools to communicate. 



It's said that the only person Kojima ever really opened up to was Ichigo, this is because he has no interest in Ichigo's other friends. 



It's made clear that he is only interested in ""older"" women. This is mentioned throughout the series several times by Ichigo's friends. We can assume that when asked about love, Kojima simply replied ""I'm into older women"". Not as in 40/50 year old women, but 4000/5000 year old women, humans offer him little interest in terms of love. 



When Aizen came to Karakura, he was able to maintain his consciousness and not only that, but he could keep a clear head and find ways to distract Aizen, especially by throwing the fire bomb. (Did not draw his sword as it could blow his cover possibly.)  



In the character book, Kojima's profile has this mysterious line, 'He has a cute face, but he's actually a ????'. He's actually a what? A Royal Guard? I think so. 



This brings us to the latest chapter with the mystery sword. Since Ichigo was born, it was Kojima's job to protect him and be a silent knight, ensuring that nothing were to happen to him and was told only to intervene if he was in trouble. When Ichigo's reiatsu suddenly vanished and was trapped by Kirge's prison, Ichigo completly dropped off Kojima's radar. Quickly springing into action, he killed Kirge and points his sword towards Urahara. 



Kojima does not see Urahara as an ally, just a source of information. Urahara is so surprised because in the past he has felt Kojima's presence. (When Kojima watched Ichigo, Uryuu and Chad go into the portal to Hueco Mundo). But, because he could only feel it faintly, he assumed it was on the low end of the spectrum, but in actuality, Urahara was grasping at the coat tails of his power. His reitsu was so high Urahara could only feel the very edge of it. 



I believe Juha Bach sent Kirge to Hueco Mundo, knowing Ichigo would go there and he had Kirge trap him, because he knew that Ichigo was Royal and that Juha Bach was strong enough to provoke a response from the Royal Guard should the royal bloodline be attacked or put infront of someone as dangerous as Bach.



TLDR: Ichigo is Royal, Kojima is a Royal Guard, next chapter is going to be sweeeeeeeeeeeeeet



That's my theory, hope you enjoyed reading, i know its a bit farfetched, kind of like Tobi = Ramen Guy, but hey, anythings possible with Kubo. Sorry for any bad English. 


EDIT: Real bad spacing, i tried putting spaces in but it just saves as a wall of text. Anyone know how to fix that?

At least, that it how I have interpreted it. This brings me to the point of this post. 

We have not actually seen Ichigo's bankai. We've been led to believe that he has achieved Bankai because he constantly says ""Bankai"" and transforms and has increased capabilities, but we now know that Whitey is his true Zanpakuto. And to achieve Bankai, one must have some sort of relationship with his/her Zanpakuto, and we know that Ichigo has constantly been rejecting Whitey and trying to suppress him from taking over, no doubt due to Ichigo's belief that Bachgetsu is his true Zanpakuto.

This is why the Quincy could not steal his Bankai. He does not have a Bankai, at least not a true one. Not yet. He may not even have a true Shikai either.

Or maybe I am wrong. Maybe he has been using his true Bankai and it couldn't be stolen because he is also Quincy. Whitey has always been there, but he has always rejected him. Now, maybe he will become vastly stronger because he finally accepts Whitey as his Zanpakuto.

I could be completely wrong or this may have already been brought up and I admit that I am not the most educated in all things Bleach, so I may have missed something.  I just thought of it and decided to share it and would love your feedback. "	t5_2rk7q	True

1362348637.0	19lkog	Symbolism of this Arc (spoilers!)	Andygoesrawr	120	17	21	"I've made a post about this a while ago, but since the last time I've been thinking more about it and I thought I would post an updated version.

With most arcs of Bleach so far, each one has come with symbolism for at least one character in each arc, and so far it seems as though Kubo is leading up to some really big symbolism with the current arc. By building up I mean ever since he first started writing it, back at the end of the Soul Society arc.

This arc seems to revolve around the concept of Heaven and Earth. When you think of the heavens, however (as in the sky, not the concept of heaven), you'd realise that it has two sides to it: day and night. During the daytime, Heaven is ruled by the Sun, and during the nighttime it is ruled by the Moon.

##The Sun &amp; the Moon

The Sun in this arc has definitely been represented by Yamamoto, with the Gotei 13 representing the daytime half of Heaven. While in his Bankai, he referred to himself as having the power of the Sun, and it's not too much of a stretch of the imagination. We know he has the strongest fire-type Zanpakuto in Soul Society, and when you think of what represents fire the most, you have the sun.

The Moon, however, is represented by Juha Bach, with the Vandenreich representing the nighttime half of Heaven. The moon is well known to not have any light of its own, instead needing to ""steal"" the light of the sun to be visible. Juha Bach literally stole the ""light of the sun"" (read: Yama's Bankai). After doing so, he was immediately ""eclipsed"" by the Earth (Ichigo showed up). In other words, the Schattenbereich (literally Shadow Area or Shadow Region) represents the dark side of the moon; to represent Bach being eclipsed, the Schattenbereich restrained him and forced him to retreat. Furthermore, the Sternritter represent the stars in the sky (Sternritter literally means ""star knight""), which since the beginning of time have been associated with the moon (the moon being the greater light, and the stars being the lesser lights).

##Earth

Earth in this arc is being represented by Ichigo. Ichigo has, since the beginning of the series, represented humanity as being the only human to gain not only Shinigami powers, but also Hollow powers (Kugo aside). For a long time there has been a representation of Hollows and Shinigami as opposites with humans in the middle, but if you think about how the worlds and powers are connected to one another, you'd see that Shinigami relate to Hollows in the same way as they relate to humans. Hueco Mundo (literally ""Hollow world"") exists on a plane alongside Earth, representing Earth as it is if it was void of humanity or ""heart"" (basically a ""hollow"" Earth). As such, Earth and Hueco Mundo are on the same level. Then, above the two, we have Soul Society which represents Heaven. Below them we have Hell, which represents Hell (no mystery there).

Ichigo ascended Heaven at the climax of the last arc, becoming a being which represents pure humanity as a combination of Heaven and Earth (reason and instinct), which to me mirrors Nietzschean philosophy's concept of the Ubermensch perfectly, which is basically the idea that humans have two sides to them (reason and instinct), and by finding a perfect balance to them a person can become the Ubermensch (literally meaning ""superman"" (the comic book character was based loosely on this philosophy, not the other way around :P)). And then of course, after Ichigo became the Ubermensch he lost his powers, becoming entirely human.

The reason Nimaiya and Isshin have told Ichigo that he isn't a real Shinigami is because he is still the Ubermensch, meaning Tensa Zangetsu and Hollow Ichigo are still fused within him. However, since this arc also has the Quincies which represent the night side of Heaven, Ichigo has discovered (and will continue to discover) his Quincy powers, which link him to both sides of Heaven.

Ichigo, as we have long known, represents the ""Moon-slayer"". The kanji for Zangetsu (斬月) is made up of the kanji for kill - ""zan (斬)"" - and the kanji for the moon - ""getsu (月)"". So, Zangetsu quite literally means ""kill the moon"". Ever since the first time Zangetsu's name was revealed, it's been a bit of a mystery as to why it's called ""moon-slayer"", and I feel as though Kubo has been working up to the climax of the series where Ichigo will finally slay the moon.

**TL;DR: Yamamoto is the Sun, Juha Bach is the Moon, and Ichigo is Earth. Ichigo will slay the Moon**

The trio that rushed Yamamoto are definitely alive. So, why did they rush Yamamoto if it apparently achieved nothing (from both their end and Yamamoto's)? I'm more convinced than ever there's something about Yamamoto's final fight (with both Juhabach and Royd) we haven't been told.

There's clearly more to the letters than simply the unique ability it might name. As theorised by the fandom, it does appear to also denote hierarchy, and hierarchy tends to represent something else: a prioritising of value. Now, what that value seems to go beyond the power - at least that's the subtext I'm getting from both Manga Panda and Mangastream. What it is, however... well, I suspect that would reveal too much at this point, so I'm not expecting clarification for a while.

There's something I've been theorising from the start and it's part of my theory that I'm not convinced the quincies (as a group) are the final enemy, even if Juhabach was the final enemy. In fact, it's something I wanted to see for my theory to continue to be viable for any length of time: that the quincies following Juhabach do not fully know what Juhabach is up to. In this chapter, for the first time, we get a very strong indication that these quincies - even the top ranking ones - are not privvy to their emperor's motives and goals. And they apparently don't know everything there is to know about quincies.

There's a stark contrast at work in this chapter when comparing it to the quincy assault on Seireitei. They had data on the shinigami. It's questionable how much they knew about appearances, but they knew about names, ranks, powers (or at least those who bothered to read the reports did).

Nobody recognises Uryuu. Even when they're told he's the last quincy survivor in the world, that is not a source of recognition for them. That doesn't automatically reveal Uryuu's identity to them. More importantly, Juhabach outright states Uryuu's full name... and it still means nothing to the Stern Ritters. Even more importantly, they didn't even know Juhabach was planning something like this - given the shock, it looks like even Uryuu's recruitment was a secret until his 'reveal' to the troops. He's a bolt out of the blue, a complete unknown, something that have precisely no information on.

And that is downright bizarre. In fact, it's utterly suspicious.

Quick aside: last quincy alive in the world/lone quincy survivor in the world. This is either support for the theory that the Vandenreich quincies are dead (leaving the Ishida duo the last living quincies) or it means the quincies withdrew from the World of the Living to a secret location beyond the World of the Living and the Ishida duo are the last quincies left outside the Vandenreich.

So, for now, this statement does not tell us whether the Vandenreich quincies are living or dead (or even a mixture); it does, however, given the question even more intrigue than it originally had. I'm therefore going to move on from that.

Now, Juhabach's announcement. How much more suspicious can this announcement get?

Not only is it strange that there's so little knowledge on Uryuu within the Stern Ritter given that the arc has built them up as a very efficient data collectors, but Kirge knew things about the Ishida family (things he both was and was not willing to discuss) and, given the way the Stern Ritter have reacted, the Ishida name means nothing to them. So, who was Kirge? Why did he seem to know more than the Stern Ritters do? What was his place in the hierarchy (and, no, pointing out he was the letter 'J' doesn't answer the question)?

And yet Juhabach clearly knows all about Uryuu. He knew about his existence, he knows his name, he knows the status of how many quincies are alive in the World of the Living (ignoring the fact that we don't know what definition of 'alive' we're using here). He even knows the truth about Uryuu's power... which apparently will be revealed now that Juhabach has awakened that power.

And this brings us to the big meaty crunch... the subject I've been banging on about ever since Kirge's fight with Ichigo: Kirge knew about Souken. He knew about Uryuu. He was willing to talk about Souken, and he was willing to talk about Uryuu. To a point anyway. And it was like Ryuuken never existed. Not even a whisper. Why? Why was Ryuuken blanked so completely?

It's just happened again, clear as day in this chapter and even less subtletly than in the Kirge/Ichigo conversation. Ryuuken does not exist to the Stern Ritter. Juhabach said Uryuu was the last quincy left in the world. Either there's a giant hole in Juhabach's knowledge or he just lied through his teeth. Given that it shouldn't be possible for Juhabach to know about Uryuu's existence without knowing at least something about the lineage he's come from, and especially since he seems so knowledgeable about Uryuu's great power, he has to know Uryuu's parentage.

And that means the most likely possibility is that he's just lied through his teeth to the Stern Ritter and, apparently, the Stern Ritter aren't allowed to know Ryuuken exists. Now, a week or so ago, I posted that there seems to be a deliberate contrast going on between Juhabach and Ryuuken. I even concluded with the comment that the contrast leaves me feeling like there isn't one quincy king, but there's actually two (or, perhaps more accurately, there isn't one person with the power of the quincy king, there's two people with the power of the quincy king). And now Uryuu is Juhabach's successor?

This brings us to an important question: what is really meant by 'successor'? What's meant by 'emperor' for that matter. What is the Quincy King? I have theories on that, theories that connect to the idea that perhaps there's more than one quincy with the power of a Quincy King and which therefore make Ryuuken's flashback desire to protect the future of the quincies very important and Souken's absence during the flashback arc also very important.

The other important question is... why. Why does Juhabach need a successor? What's the limitation on his future that makes him feel he needs to have one. And why the hell is he putting on such a display with a quincy that the story has indicated to the reader is a mixed-blood after the story has also told us that he's engaged in purges of mixed blood quincies and even impure pure-bloods? As red flags go, that's a huge one. The kind you can see planted on the moon. With the naked eye.

In short, to go back to my original question... what on earth is this 'successor' business?

I don't want to run off into a tangent at this point, but since I'm only discussing Juhabach's announcement right now, I have to make this observation: when Juhabach comments on Uryuu's true power, there's a big panel of Uryuu's face. And you know what his expression looks like to me? Sad. That does not automatically mean he's not brainwashed, but I think he's there of his own free will. I don't know whether it's the end goal he's hoping to achieve that makes him sad, or the path he's taking to achieve it that makes him sad. But, for someone who longed for so long to be a powerful quincy, who vowed to become powerful to change his father's mind about the quincies, the expression (during a conversation about him achieving his true power) should not be so sad. Yet it is. Solely because of Uryuu's expression, the entire page reads like an unfolding tragedy.

At this point, I'm beginning to come around to the idea that Uryuu has indeed learned the truth about his father's heart (I had it on the table from the flashback arc, but I wasn't sure I was entirely thrilled with the thought). Souken always said the truth would lead to him make an important decision about what he'd do with his quincy power, and Isshin's version of the tale isn't enough for that. It leaves questions. In fact, it raises questions. So I think Uryuu's been told something Ichigo has not been and, as Souken said, what we're seeing unfold is his decision.... what and why, remains a mystery. But suddenly, Uryuu doesn't look so happy to be a quincy anymore.

And then we have Buzby. He and Ikkaku were separated at birth, I'm sure of it. Except that Ikkaku isn't so nasty to his subordinates as this guy. That scene with the quincies is interesting for a lot of reasons. Not only because it reveals how in the dark they are about their leader, but also the kind of mistrust they're living under. There are quincies spying on the quincies? Juhabach does not trust his own men? Again, this raises the flag of the quincies as a group not necessarily being the final enemy, even if the leadership turns out to be. And there's not the indication they serve their leader out of the kind of loyalty that comes from love or respect or worship. They follow out of fear. That's the implication coming across... or at least, a lot of them do. That interesting fellow with the eye-on-a-stick might have genuine loyalty, or he might be the kind to have extreme loyalty from the 'subordinate bully' (remain in the bully's favour so other kids get bullied instead). That's fear, too. The pathetic kind. On top of that, he's spying openly... so not only is there the implication that Juhabach doesn't trust his men, but he wants them to know he doesn't trust them. That breeds mistrust and a culture of informing on each other. Familiar story, no? Considering the themes, it's hardly surprising, but it does keep an army fractured from uniting to oppose the leader (more on this in a moment).

And then we have Haschwalth, and even his first name, and a nickname! Boy, are we going to be dealing with him a bit in the future!

First thing to note with Haschwalth - the men assumed Haschwalth would be the Emperor's successor. So, nothing that's been explicitly announced, just an assumption. More importantly, we don't see any claim that Haschwalth himself believed he would be - what we're seeing is that the men assumed that Haschwalth assumed he would be the successor. Haschwalth himself is carefully not letting on what he might or might not have assumed and certainly not how he personally feels about Uryuu. Aren't politics fun?

More important than this, however, is the attitude of the men towards Haschwalth. There are two main types of general in a story - the kind that's abusing their power and trying to take over from the shadows, and the kind that's the loyal soldier, who has the respect and loyalty of the men, rather than the fear of them. And this is one of the things that makes this chapter so interesting: we see a the implication that Juhabach has taken Uryuu as his own and is personally grooming him, surrounded by an army that fear, rather love, the emperor and whose first impressions of Uryuu are very, very bad. And this is contrasted against the second-in-command who clearly has the personal respect, support and loyalty of the men who are getting angry with Uryuu because of their loyalty to Haschwalth. They feel Haschwalth has been insulted, and are reacting on that basis.

So, Juhabach's army follows Juhabach.... because Haschwalth does. And this again raises a flag with me that perhaps the quincies are not the final enemy. More importantly, the fate of the quincy army may rest on the decisions and beliefs of Haschwalth. I've already felt there's something going on with Haschwalth given his reactions to Ichigo's appearance in front of Juhabach at Soul Society. He seemed to care a great deal about how Juhabach treated Ichigo, and Juhabach did seem to notice. Even then, I felt we needed to know a lot more about who Haschwalth is and what role he's set up to play in this arc. I believe it's even more important now if this chapter's implication is right and that it's truly Haschwalth who commands the respect of the army, not Juhabach.

This is also important for another point: Kubo, in this chapter, is setting up Haschwalth as being a threat to Uryuu in terms of rivalry. And I'm not convinced by it at all. Haschwalth's men clearly want this to be the case and even are expecting this to be the case. They feel Haschwalth has been snubbed and that this cannot be ignored. With that other fellow spying on them (and so openly, too, see my earlier paragraph about the idea of Juhabach wanting a fractured army), Juhabach may even be expecting this. Perhaps he's even counting on it. We'll have to see.

However, appearances can be deceiving and, if Haschwalth is being set up from the start to look like Uryuu's rival and biggest threat, either Kubo's lost the ability to be subtle or Haschwalth is going to turn out to be Uryuu's ally. It already seems like Haschwalth has some kind of empathy for Ichigo and if Haschwalth is the key to the army's support for Juhabach, then what Haschwalth truly feels and what his true motives are for supporting Juhabach become very important. Especially for Uryuu. Especially if Uryuu is there of his own free will rather than through 're-education'.

So, we have names, we have letters, and I don't think we're going to learn what 'A' or 'B' represents for quite a while, since there's a lot of mystery surrounding the motives and behaviour of all three men involved with those two letters.

God, it feels good to have a chapter that's focused on plot in a political way instead of a fighting way.

But most of all, of the questions this chapter makes me ask, my biggest question has to be this: who the hell is Ryuuken Ishida? Why is it so important that the quincies don't know he exists? Because that's what I'm getting from this chapter: Juhabach absolutely does not want to admit to the other quincies that Ryuuken exists. And that has to beg the question, why?"	t5_2rk7q	True

Urahara is a COP OUT if his motivations and desires don't come to be revealed to be quite grand in scale.

I'm pretty sure, in the end, this is all the story of Urahara Kisuke. Go watch ep. 309 again, in which Aizen is defeated. He has a very INTRIGUING conversation with Urahara which reveals that majorly significant plot points... involvingUrahara and the Soul King... have never been revealed.

There seems to be a lot of misinformation and misconceptions flying around, so I figured I would centralise the information.

1. Bleach is on hiatus until the 9th of September, however **we will most likely be getting that chapter on the 4th of September**, the Wednesday before the Monday. We always get chapters the Wednesday before they are actually released. We might even get it on the 3rd.
2. This hiatus does **not** mean that Bleach doesn't have long to go. The ""final chapter"" of the Arrancar arc went for 4 years, and the majority of that took place over a single day which went on for over a year. In Naruto, the current war has taken place over a few days (if that), and has been going on for about 2 years. 9 days can mean anywhere between 1 year and 5. Don't fret!
3. **(Big news!) Every week during the break, we will be getting an arc review and interview with never-before-seen information**, much like the Repeat &amp; Reboot review we got during the break between the Fullbring arc and this one. These most likely will not be posted in English, but myself and Czeliate on Bleach Asylum will be translating the important parts from Chinese, and I'll share them here. Here is this [week's in Chinese](http://i.imgur.com/wdNOJ7m.png). This one is basically just a recap of everything which has happened in the arc, with no new information.
4. We will be doing fun stuff on the sub during the break. The tournament will be continuing, and I'm looking into hosting a trivia night on the IRC on what would normally be chapter day. If anybody has some ideas for fun stuff we can do as a community, please share them!

Hey /r/bleach! 

After a little bit of research, I discovered that one of the Bleach novels goes over the events in Soul Society, five months after the defeat of Aizen and leading up to Ichigo regaining his powers. [The Death Save the Strawberry](http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Bleach:_The_Death_Save_The_Strawberry) was co-authored by Makoto Matsubara and Tite Kubo, and there are a lot of interesting tidbits that I thought you guys would want to know, since it hasn’t been translated yet.  So, here we go (and sorry about the wall of text; can’t help it):

**Character Relations** [**[Source]**]( http://www.bleachanime.org/forums/showthread.php?t=90538)

&gt; Shinji and Momo

* Shinji met with Hinamori in the 4th division's infirmary. They introduced each other and get to know each other through their dealings with Aizen. Hinamori said she is useless and how everyone is forgetting her but Shinji retorted back by saying everyone cared for her, that's why she is resting and they're working outside there. Hinamori still referred Aizen as 'Aizen-taichou' during the conversation and Shinji noticed this. She is hopeless so he wanted to try his best to snap her out of it. He then asked her to be his subordinate, much to Hinamori's surprise, he said they should work together to bring prosper to the 5th division. Days went by, Hinamori made an excellent recovery and she worked hard as Shinji's newest vice-captain. The way she worked though, reminded Shinji of Aizen. Hinamori felt emotional with that statement. They guessed, perhaps, there was sincerity in Aizen than they would have thought. They thought it was partly their mistake not to know Aizen for who he is. Long story short, at the end of their story, Hinamori finally uttered the phrase, 'Yes, Captain Hirako' and finally replaced 'Yes, Captain Aizen' as they walked out of the scene. That page ended with a simple phrase yet the impact is huge as my friend said. He said the impact would be bigger if you read it in Japanese.

&gt; Hisagi and Kensei

* As many would have thought, Hisagi is very happy. He never smiled this much during his time as a vice-captain. They talked and their chemistry together is high earning jealousy from Mashiro. Kensei did notice his tattoo silently. He also isn't bothered with the Seireitei News so Hisagi still remained as the head editor of that organization. 9th division still leads the editorial in Seireitei. At the ending though, as Hisagi watched his new captain from his back, he silently reminded himself: ""Those who do not fear their own strength, can never hold their weapons"". His story ended with him visiting Tousen's grave or to be precise, Tousen's friend's grave where Suzumushi is placed.

&gt; Kira and Rose

* Kira was reluctant at first with this newly appointed captain. Rose corrected him that he simply gained his former position in the Gotei 13. Kira had a monologue on how the Captain-commander has changed. He is glad. They had a good talk and Kira was surprised, to see a hidden spot in the captain's office where Rose had hidden his violin. He said that his former vice-captain, Iba Chikane, hated his music so he had to hide his musical instrument. He smiled sadly and wondered where she is right now. She is the one that gave him the push to go on being the captain for the 3rd division back then. He took his hidden violin and melody chimed from his violin. Rose said that, even though he might be a new face to Kira and most of his subordinates, he will try his best to be their captain. Kira then asked Rose to join the 3rd division's inner festival, where they gather the persimmons to make dried persimmons from a single persimmon tree at the backyard and he said yes. Kira is delighted, for he and the 3rd division's only memory of Gin is of that single persimmon tree. He thanked Rose for that. Rose can only smile in the end and concluded Kira is his new muse.

&gt; Urahara, Vizards, Yamamoto, and Central 46

* This novel ties in how the Fullbring Arc is about Chad. Now he's attending boxing class just to protect Ichigo and the town. In a sense since he knows he's not worth to protect him with that kind of strength he had.

* Urahara, Yoruichi, and Tessai's ban has been lifted along with the Vizards. They're now accepted back into their homeland. Most of the characters rejoiced except Hiyori who is always hot-tempered.

* Yamamoto has the word/power within the new C46 because in between finding new members to replace the dead and old corrupted ones, Yamamoto held the authority over the whole of Soul Society for a while since it took some time to find the suitable members. He was the one that gave the word to lift the Exiled including the Vizards' bans. He said it was Aizen's doings that made them guilty.

* Urahara felt emotional, seriously emotional when Yamamoto recognized him when he came bringing the Spirit Sword. He also said something along the lines of finally being able to breath after forgetting it for so long from being drowned within the word 'exiled'.

* Hacchi stayed in Karakura to control or 'clean' the huge residual barrier left after FKT battle.

* Lisa and Mashiro often went in and out of Soul Society. Mashiro became Soul Society's prominent reporter after rejecting her position as the vice-captain from Hisagi. Hisagi is a try-hard to impress his idol. It was noted by Mashiro.

* Love simply couldn't care less about going back to Soul Society but mostly it was because he couldn't read JUMP anymore in that dusty old place.

* Lisa has a house in Rukongai after her business selling porn magazine boomed. It was called 'Palace of Porn' or something. But she rarely stays in it and opt to live in the Living World.

* Hiyori didn't want to go back simply because she hates Shinigami.

**Additional Information** [(Source; Scroll to Buzz Killington’s update posts)]( http://www.bleachanime.org/forums/showthread.php?t=90538&amp;page=2)

* Komamura is the one that persuaded Yama-jii after Rukia, to help Kurosaki Ichigo regain his former powers.

* Nanao did meet with Lisa. She asked if Nanao wanted her to read for her but she thought Nanao is big enough for that. Cue Nanao hugging her senpai. She's showing a different side of her than when she is with Kyouraku.

* In Rukia's flashback, she was in shock when she first saw the picture of Hisana because of their similarities (at this point, she was unaware of having a sister). She thought Byakuya really loved Hisana, otherwise he wouldn't have adopted a Rukongai citizen like her, who looked similar to his wife. Rukia decided to become Hisana herself in order to repay him for his kindness until decades later, when she finally learns the truth behind her adoption.

* Therefore, on the day of her Vice Captain promotion, Rukia cuts her hair, because she knows she has built a deep bond with Byakuya and her appearance no longer mattered, so there is no need to keep the same hairstyle that Hisana has. When Rukia became Vice Captain, Byakuya calls her to his room and presents her a samite box. Rukia then opens the box to reveal a pair of white gloves made with silk, with the Kuchiki clan symbol sewn inside the glove. Rukia soon realized it was custom-made for her. Byakuya tells Rukia that after becoming a Vice Captain, chances of using zanpakuto will be frequent. Her zanpakuto is an ice type so wearing the gloves will prevent her from catching cold or frostbite very easily. Rukia can't help but to take a deep bow to express her gratitude towards Byakuya while holding her gloves.

* The story also mentions that the reason Rukia is able to promoted to be a Vice captain is because of a recommendation from Byakuya. Also in one other part when Rukia finally found a way to regain Ichigo's power and went on to ask for help from all the team, she falls down carelessly, causing her nose to turn red. When she returns to the Kuchiki house, Byakuya noticed her red nose, yet he did not ask what happen. However, when Rukia returns to her room, Byakuya went straight to Hisana's altar, facing the portrait of Hisana and spoke softly: ""should I ask what happened...?"" 

* There is a mention of a scene where Rangiku visits Gin’s grave.

""I wasn't trying to hide it or anything. It's just that 'she' wasn't in the mood for it. This is why I don't like playing with her. My Katenkyokotsu has the power to turn children's games into reality. She decides the rules and everyone who enters the domain of her spiritual pressure must play, myself included.""

**He then explains her games**

""She's a self centered one. Even though she's my favorite sword, it's quite draining always doing what she wants.""

**I noticed that the whole time he is only talking about one sword, the one shown on the screen. And he always refers to her in a singular manner. Even though it's filler: in the Zanpakuto Rebellion each of his swords had an identity. So maybe the Bankai has to do with the other side of his Zanpakuto**

**I know it's a long shot in the dark, but what turned me is how he said:** *She's my favorite sword* **When he clearly has two.**

 How would you play favorites with only one of something anyways ? And I doubt when he says that, that he's comparing his Zanpakuto to every other Zapakuto.

1367532695.0	1dkwa1	"The true nature of ""Soul King"" and Aizen's plan"	Leviathanus	92	12	81	"Hello.

I have been thinking about this lately so I came up with a theory.

Let's see the conversation between Aizen and Urahara:

Aizen: ""Urahara Kusike! I despise you! You possess such a great intellect, why do you not act!? How are you able to let yourself be ruled by a thing like that!?""
Urahara: ""A thing like that? You mean the Spirit King? I see. So you've seen it. Without the Spirit King's existence, soul society would be rent asunder. The Spirit King is the lynchpin. If that lynchpin is lost, then things would simply crumble away. That is the way the world is.”

Aizen: ""That is the theory of the vanquished! Victors must always speak of the way the world should be, not the way the world is!""

What does this mean? It means that Aizen saw this ""Spirit King"" and he learned something about it. Something so repellent that Aizen betrayed SS, killed his underlings and decided to kill this Spirit King. 
During Urahara's line the manga and anime showed Aizen's face and to be honest he has not the eyes of a crazy maniac who just wants to become god. I mean it's friggin Aizen we are talking about. It would be too simple.
There has to be some reason. 
And by the way. I totally agree with Aizen:""That is the theory of the vanquished! Victors must always speak of the way the world should be, not the way the world is!"" I could just sign this right now.

My theory is that this Spirit King needs Souls to survive. But it would be too much of a bother to do it himself. So he created SS and told the Shinigami to bring souls to SS. But part of these souls are being send to Soul King. Maybe that's what Aizen learned about and that's why he hated Soul King so much.

And my theory who this Soul King really is: At the beginning of time there were just one type of souls. The ""origin"" of all souls. Due to some ""fluctuations"" some souls merged together and created a much stronger combined soul. This soul separated the rest of the souls into four weaker souls: shinigami, human, quincy and hollow. 
He chose this 4 types because he feared that someday these separated souls merged again into one strong soul and that soul could be a danger to his existence.
Now look at those 4 types. The Shinigami hate Quincy (they were told that because of some conflict Shinigami and Quincy are at war, but that was obviously a big fat lie). Shinigami and Quincy kill Hollows. And basically everthing kills a normal weak Human. The plan is perfect. Everyone is killed each other. 
BUT Aizen saw through this and maybe he even speculated that there was this original ""perfect"" soul. That's why he wanted to break the border between Shinigami and Hollow to create this perfect soul or become this perfect being himself hoping that he will be strong enough to bring this Spirit King down.

I think that Aizen has a second plan. This plan is called Ichigo Kurosaki. He is this perfect soul he wanted to create. The only question is how does Aizen want to convince Ichigo to fight by his site. There comes plan C which i don't know. But Aizen does for sure.

What do you think about all that?"	t5_2rk7q	True

I've seen some other people complaining about since ""He's stronger than Renji"" and crap, but I'm strongly pro Ichigo failing the Asauchi test. He's the hero of the manga. And a hero isn't supposed to be someone who is the strongest and is... awesome. He's supposed to be someone that isn't the strongest but that overcomes odds. Best arc of Bleach? Invasion of Soul Society. Ichigo was the underdog, learning basic shit. Shikai, bankai, flash step. I love seeing him one shot people and I like it when his getsuga tenshou's get stronger, but the manga was heading in a direction where Ichigo outstripped everyone by such a ridiculous degree, the upcoming arc would've been everyone getting one shot while Ichigo took on all the baddies. *That's what happened at the end of the Invasion of Karakura Town*. So I strongly support Ichigo failing the Asauchi test and having to start from ground zero.

1351681921.0	12e5zv	A pretty radical theory regarding Juha Bach.	besterthanyouare	82	9	36	"Some things that Juha has said have made me wonder about his powers and origin. In chapter 510, when we learn about the Sternritters Loyd and Royd, the twin that Yamamoto fought was Royd, the twin who can copy memories and personality but NOT powers. So, by that fact, it's safe to assume that every move we see Bach(Royd) using before the real Bach appears are Royd's own moves. After Royd's death and the appearance of the real Juha Bach, we see him use the energy sword to kill Yama. Other than that, he demonstrates no other power besides his physical sword and combat effectiveness when he stabs Ichigo in the neck. 

-pause-

Juha Bach is quotable in both major translations(panda, stream) as saying that the Gotei 13 ""died 1000 years ago... along with us."" He also states that Yama ""may not be aware of this until now,"" which means the 'death' of the gotei 13 holds more of a metaphorical meaning than a literal one, as in the ideologies of the 13 had shifted. This is further supported by Bach stating that Yama had grown soft after the extermination of the Quincies, and that he used to be a 'demon with the sword'. He talks about how cruel Yama could be to his own men if it meant victory in battle. This cruelty is a quality that Bach has demonstrated with his own subordinates on several occasions. Also, when we see the flashback to Shunsui as a young Shinigami, he is in Yama's room looking at a painting of a man wrapped in flames. Yamamoto says it was a monster that appeared in soul society long ago, when soul society was already in a mess, and made things worse. This is a painting of Yamamoto as he was then. In the next panel, Yama has his back turned saying that the monster will never appear again, symbolic of Yama turning his back on that side of himself. 

-pause-

The ability of these Quincy invaders to steal bankai is still shrouded in mystery. In order to develop such an ability, it would take someone of Mayori or Urahara's scientific skill. Or, someone who has a very intricate knowledge of bankai and how it works. This would mean someone who has been training with bankai for a very long time.

-pause, into conclusion-

The real Juha Bach has only used an energy sword in battle, and they made a specific point to tell the readers that the Sternritter impersonating Bach could copy only his personality and memories, not powers. Juha Bach and Yamamoto's conversation exchanges suggest some familiarity between the two. It's as if Juha Bach knew him back when he made he had his 'change of heart'. Juha also seems to have a fairly intricate knowledge of Yama's bankai as it was 1000 years ago. In my opinion, a bit too intricate for someone who had presumably fought against him. Reasoning being, I don't think an *enemy* would have said knowledge because they would probably have died to his bankai in battle, especially if Yama was as ruthless as Bach suggests. How else then might Bach know about his bankai?

.

.

.

Juha Bach is a Shinigami.

He founded the Gotei 13 along with Yamamoto. 

Their differing ideologies(cruelty vs. tolerance, extermination vs. cleansing) eventually led to the 'death' of the Gotei 13 when Bach left soul society to either join or form the Quincies. Yamamoto didn't kill Bach 1000 years ago because he knew him, and took mercy on him. This could also explain Haschwald's tremendous display of power when he effortlessly sliced Tensa Zangetsu in half, the same sword that was so sturdy it felt like your own sword was going to break just by striking it. Juha Bach and Haschwald probably joined forces around the time Bach left the Shinigami ranks.

Juha Bach has had 1000 years to develop a way to steal Shinigami's bankai, probably because he was able to study his own bankai.

**The subreddit:** /r/ShingekiNoKyojin

**The mangaka:** Hajime Isayama

**Original run:** 2011 - ongoing

***

**Summary:** The story of SNK takes place in a world dominated by giant humanoid creatures known as ""titans."" These titans generally range from 3 to 15 meters tall, and they eat humans for seemingly no reason. More than 100 years have passed since the last time titans actually attacked humanity; however, that is only because the remaining human population has imprisoned itself within three massive 50-meter walls. These walls protect and separate the territory of humans from that of the titans, and they create an illusion of peace for humanity. This illusion unfortunately only lasts until the sudden appearance of an unprecedented 60-meter tall titan, who breaks the outermost wall and causes hordes of titans to enter human territory and devour everyone they could get their hands on.

One of the few people who experienced and survived this tragedy was a boy by the name of Eren Jaeger, who as a result grows up believing in one important goal: ""slaughter every titan in the world.""

The story then follows Eren’s journey as he enters the military and joins the ongoing effort to reclaim what humanity has lost.

1364591162.0	1b9jyq	Possible mechanism for Ichigo's hollow and zanpakto inheritance. [531 spoilers]	NauticalInsanity	75	3	42	"The events of the recent chapter have raised a lot of questions about how Ichigo obtained his powers. There's been speculation about zanpaktos being hereditary, Isshin passing Engetsu onto Ichigo, the black hollow being implanted in Isshin, etc...

Perhaps however, we already have the answer. In the fight with Juha Bach, Bach explains to Haschwald and Ichigo that Ichigo must have learned blut from his fight with Kirge Opie. What we were told is that Ichigo, being part quincy, has the ability to subconsciously learn from the reishi around him and assimilate that to his own use. We saw this a bit in how his hollow mask matured between every espada fight he engaged in. By fighting hollows, he was absorbing their reishi and subconsciously learning to use their powers.

We've also known that hollows leave imprints on people. This hollow fight is clearly extremely important and would have left a very strong mark on Isshin. Likewise, a zanpakto is the most important element of the shinigami's power and would certainly have a ""memory.""

So when Ichigo was in training with Urahara, perhaps he didn't have Zangetsu and his hollow already in him, but forged them, imitating two of the most powerful reishi memories he had been exposed to. That would explain why Zangetsu is not quite Engetsu and why Ichigo's early hollow transformations were mishappen creatures rather than the fully-formed vasto lorde that Isshin fought."	t5_2rk7q	True

1351125917.0	121eq3	On the relationship between shinigami, hollows, quincies, and fullbringers (513 spoilers)	NauticalInsanity	76	9	17	"So there has been some complaining from people that Ichigo is now a Shinigami, a Hollow, a Fullbringer AND a Quincy. This seems to paint Ichigo as manbearpig rather than a believable character. I wanted to offer my interpretation of these aspects that in my opinion paints a simpler picture of Ichigo.

Let's start with Hollows and Shinigami. On the surface Vizoreds and Arrancar seem like some sort of handwavey BS conjured up to produce a new threat to soul society. However, what we learn from Tensa Zangetsu in Ichigo's final voyage into the inner world is that Zangetsu and Hichigo are one and the same, manifestations of Ichigo's power. The conclusion I draw from this is that Shinigami and Hollows are actually identical creatures. They both are souls that draw from an inner energy reservoir to manifest a unique power.

Where they differ is the nature they use to materialize their power. In Ichigo's fight with Hichigo, his hollow half spoke about fighting with instinct and tapping into the primal need to fight. In the confrontations with Zangetsu, Ichigo's zanpakto spoke about the will to fight and heart. So where Hollows are creatures of instinct and use their instinct to focus their power, the Shinigami are creatures of heart and use their will to protect to focus their power. However, at their core, both are still souls with riatsu. Therefore, the vizard and arrancar were not transformed so much as they had opened to them the other half of their nature. The analogy would be hooking up a second faucet to the same pipe and turning it on and off at will. The arrancar adopt the zanpakto as the symbol of their adoption of will as a channel and the vizard adopt the mask as a symbol of their adoption of instinct. In a sense, every Shinigami is already half hollow, and every hollow part shinigami, but they remain distinct because each of them only uses one half of their nature to condense their power. Thus Ichigo being half hollow is a natural extension of his shinigami heritage.

As for his quincy background, it shouldn't be viewed as ""suddenly Ichigo is a quincy,"" but ""Ichigo is the product of a long line of events that resulted in Isshin marrying a quincy woman."" As for why he suddenly learned Blut Vene, is anyone's guess, but I would posit that Ichigo has always been using his quincy powers, if subconsciously. As we know, the quincy collect ambient Reshi and condense it into weapons. Ichigo tends to use his abilities intuitively, so forming this into a weapon would be hard for him. Rather, it's possible that as his riatsu manifested, he began to subconsciously absorb reshi to fuel his riatsu. This would explain how especially in Hueco Mundo and Soul Society, he fundamentally became more powerful for every fight and why Urahara and Aizen expected him to develop so quickly. 

For the Fullbring, I wouldn't necessarily say that Ichigo having a fullbring means Misaki was attacked by a Hollow during pregnancy. Fullbring is a technique used by humans with almost no well of spiritual pressure to channel the riatsu of objects as weapons. This is pretty close to quincy techniques. Because quincies use artifacts to boost their power, it's possible that this is a holdover from early quincies who were in fact fullbringers. As the quincies discovered more about their abilities, they learned how to apply their abilities directly to reishi rather than relying purely on objects. If this is the case, Ginjo likely realized that Ichigo's heritage lent him the ability to master a fullbring, rather than some chance circumstance of his prenatal care.

**In summary Ichigo isn't some 200% creation, but purely a Shinigami and Quincy. Everything else is merely an alternate manifestation of his heritage.**"	t5_2rk7q	True

So…let me get this straight~ 

Ichigo is half shinigami(Isshin half)/half quincy(Misaki half).

His actual shinigami zanpakuto is a hollow (Hichigo/Shirosaki).

Which means old man Zangetsu is not really Zangetsu (making Hichigo the one and true Zangetsu).

So old man Zangetsu is actually the manifestation of Ichigo’s quincy powers (who just happens to look like Juha Bach/Yhwach from a 1000 years ago) and has been lying about what/who he/it truly is to Ichigo all this time.

Ichigo has basic quincy powers because of his mother (which have been somewhat dormant since he didn’t know about them, but have recently awoken/been acknowledged).

Hichigo was telling the truth the whole time about him actually being Zangetsu.

Tensa Zangetsu and Shika Zangetsu are both hichigo, but this whole time they seemed to be Old Man Zangetsu because he was deceiving Ichigo.

And now for my assumptions…

I assume that the reason Tensa Zangetsu was a younger looking Old Man Zangetsu is because that form is somewhat of a mix of both Hichigo and 1000 years younger Yhwach because Yhwach’s deception over what Ichigo’s power truly looked liked was weakened and started to look somewhat closer to Hichigo’s since the real Zangetsu’s power was becoming more prominent looks wise.

SIMPLY PUT: Pretty much the reason Old Man Zangetsu looked younger in Tensa Zangetsu Bankai mode was because Hichigo (The REAL Zangetsu) was manifesting more making the deception’s of Yhwach weaker and making him appear younger just like Hichigo’s looks (which is basically Ichigo’s looks).

So to finish this I assume that the reason Ichigo’s final Zanpakuto form looks like young Yhwach and Hichigo combined is because it is pretty much that. His final form is still truly his final ultimate form because it is both his quincy and shinigami powers together at its peak which made him pretty much just a god in his own right for that short period of time with both of those super powers together at their fullest and Ichigo becoming one with both of them.

THAT IS WHY ICHIGO’S FINAL FORM DIDN’T HAVE AN ACTUAL SWORD BUT RATHER HIS RIATSU TOOK FORM OF A SWORD COMING OUT OF HIS HAND JUST LIKE HOW A QUINCY MAKES A BOW WITH THEIR RIATSU MAKING IT TRULY THE SUPER COMBINATION OF QUINCY’S RIATSU BASED WEAPON AND A SHINIGAMI’S ZANPAKUTO!!!!!

I really hope I got this all right and this is actually how it works out. Do you agree with me?"	t5_2rk7q	True

1362044109.0	19e0af	There was some interesting Ichigo character reveal in this chapter.	NauticalInsanity	75	7	18	"While big reveals are fun and exciting, and in that regard, it didn't do much, I thought it was fantastic in showing Ichigo's character.

Back in the Fullbring arc when Ishida was attacked, Ichigo felt powerless and isolated. He clearly wanted to find who attacked his friend, but without his powers he couldn't. Ichigo had a huge support network of friends and family whom he could turn to to talk about it, but he isolated himself, and turned to the fullbringers to regain his powers. That of course was disastrous.

Since gaining his powers, Ichigo's friends and companions turned to him for help every time. He expects himself to save the day and fight for everyone, and being powerless shames him. So rather than facing his shame of being powerless in the form of facing his friends, he ran, and turned to strangers for help.

What this chapter showed us is that Ichigo is in much the same position again. His friends are in danger, his bankai broken, and he is placed at the doorstep of the one man who can help him fix it. Through his head runs the prospect of having to face the people he feels he must protect, and again, he runs. He runs to Ikumi, who knows nothing of Soul Reapers and Quincies. Going to her, he doesn't have to face the shame. Then Isshin shows up, and Ichigo realizes he's at the risk of repeating the same mistakes again, and goes with his father. "	t5_2rk7q	True

We know that Shinigami purify the souls of Hollows and Quincies exterminate them. It seems like the Quincies are committing genocide, but maybe they're actually humanity's best hope. 

Soul Society is broken. The warrior and noble classes live in comfort while the commoners live in squalor. Rukongai is divided into districts and the vast majority of these districts are slums. Why is there a Hell if SS isn't Heaven? Why does Hueco Mundo exist at all? Most importantly what the fuck is the Soul King? We know Urahara and Aizen have seen ""it"" and understand that whatever it is that SS's existence depends on it. 

We've been invested in SS from the beginning and have come to accept that it is necessary. I believe that Ywhach believes that there is an alternative, that Heaven can exist. For Heaven to exist SS needs to be destroyed and rebuilt. To destroy SS you need to usurp the SK. Aizen thought he had the power necessary to achieve this, but we all know he was wrong. He went about it the wrong way. You can't beat the SK when you are playing by his rules. 

We know that there is a Hell, Soul Society, the human world and the Ice Palace. This seems superfluous. Why allow so many humans to turn into Hollows in the first place? It doesn't make sense, unless Hollows exist because the SK wants them too. The very existence of such a high amount of hollows is a byproduct of his reign. By allowing human souls to digress into hollows it creates a cycle. This cycle keeps the king on his throne. 

There's a reason that Shinigami lack a presence in the human world. The SK wants you to become a Hollow. He wants Hollows to devour as many souls as possible. He needs strong Shinigami to purify strong Hollows. When a Hollow is purified it passes through the SK granting him power before crossing over to become a second class citizen in SS. This is what Urahara meant when he called the SK the lynch pin.

The majority of souls in SS live in a complete shit hole. When they get there they arrive in a place where they can't be with loved ones, where they don't know anyone, where they have little chance to advance in society, but in the small chance they manage, they are rewarded with power beyond anything a human could imagine. Power they are told is essential to protecting the weaker souls. This is bullshit. Shinigami are necessary only because strong hollows are allowed to manifest. How much power does it take to guide a ghost to the afterlife? Why is it so hard to enter the human world? I believe that this process used to be simple and fundamental. The SK created an imbalance in reality by taking the ""throne"" by force and subjecting the rest of the soul's to his will. The SK created the walls between worlds. Aizen couldn't beat him because he was playing into his hand. Aizen created the most powerful Hollows ever. All this did was perpetuate the cycle. To usurp the Soul King you must remove his source of power. You have to exterminate Hollows.  

Hollows devour souls to become stronger. To become stronger they need a place to thrive. Since the rebirth of the Quincy we know that creating pocket dimensions is entirely possible. The Vandereich exists in a separate plane. I propose that the SK created Hueco Mundo to breed strong hollows. When a hollow is purified it is reduced to one soul. The rest of that power is absorbed by the King. Ywhach understood this and created techniques to exterminate Hollows effectively turning off the faucet for the SK. The Soul King reacted to this by granting his Shinigami far greater powers and position. 

Under the leadership of Yamamoto the Shinigami became more powerful than ever. They then declared war on the Qunicies and defeated them, but allowed them to exist. This instilled a sense of morality into the Shinigami. They believed they were fighting the good fight. They were preserving the human race by purifying Hollows and defending the worlds against the genocidal Quincy army. They are just defending what they know. Who wouldn't strive to become a Shinigami? However Yamamoto most certainly understood what he was building. He was a blood thirsty and extremely competent military commander. He was not ""just following orders"", he agreed with the status quo that afforded him his power and position. He hates Ywhach and summarily destroyed his movement when given the chance. He had no regrets about exterminating the Quincy. It afforded the SS hundreds of years of peace. Then Ichigo arrived.

That's as far as I'm taking this. Thanks for reading!


**TL;DR: Hollows are the source of the SK's power therefore the quincy are right to eliminate them because the SK is an evil fuck and SS needs rebuilt from the ground up.**

2. Approx. 20 years before Bleach starts, Isshin gets in trouble with Soul Society for helping out the Ishida family escape soul society's grip. He escapes with Uryuu's father (forgot his name atm) and goes to the real world. He gets help from Urahara to hide. Somewhere along the lines he uses Final Getsuga, possibly to willingly lose all his shinigami powers and hide. 

3. There he falls in love with Ichigo's mother and Ichigo is born. Aizen has kept tabs on where Isshin is the whole time and realizes what Ichigo is and can be.

They are essentially the shinigami's will to fight focused into physical form (As zangetsu puts it, the ""Real"" zangetsu is the portion of Ichigo's soul that exists purely for the purpose of defeating his enemies).

Ichigo's true power comes from his resolve - he just says ""This is what needs to happen"" and goes out and makes it happen whether it's meant to be possible or not (he loses focus a bit over the later arcs, but the soul society arc is the best example of his attitude).

Put the two together and it's fitting that Zangetsu is permanently in shikai. Sealing it's power again would be taking a step back, and Ichigo is all about moving forward. Zangetsu even SAYS to ichigo when he first releases him: ""Retreat and you will age, hesitate and you will die."" 

Also notice that although bankai can't be maintained permanently, Ichigo can hold his bankai for a ridiculously long time compared to other characters. Zangetsu moves forwards, not backwards unless given absolutely no choice. The fact that Zangetsu's shikai (before the time skip at least) is really nothing but the sword blade with a bit of cloth wrapped around the metal that would normally be sealed inside a grip also comes to mind.

Well, as you all know there is a 5 week hiatus. Usually this would mean we'd be manga-less until somewhere around September. But, thanks to the idea of /u/t0lk, we've come up with a way to keep manga coming out on chapter days!

Over the next 5 weeks we'll be featuring a new manga each week. Some of which have their own subreddits, and we'll have the mods from the subreddits come over and talk about what it is. And if ya like it you can have something new to talk about! Even if it's not Bleach, it'll help us interact as a community. 

We'll still be having the tournaments and regular posts as well, so it's not gonna completely die here!

Without further adieu, let's get the first post out to give you a feel for how it'll work!

The first week's manga is **[Witch Hunter!](http://www.mangapanda.com/333-22810-1/witch-hunter/chapter-1.html)**

Witch Hunter is kiiiinda like Bleach. Kinda. Basically, witches and humans coexist until one day the witches randomly declare war on humans. Witches summon supporters (kinda like zanpakutos, but more like aeons from Final Fantasy) to wreak havoc and kill people. The humans form a group called Witch Hunters to try and kill the witches. The story is about one particular Witch Hunter who happens to have a supporter as well. And 2 guns. Like Starrk. Except Starrk would spank this guy. Hard.

I read the first couple chapters, and it's not bad! It has a Soul Eater-y kinda vibe too.

Seeing as I've only read the first couple chapters, I can't really go into detail about it. Nor is there a subreddit for Witch Hunter. So this one's entirely on us. Let's talk about it!

1351774449.0	12ge1n	[Theory] I'm starting to get the feeling that...		67	10	72	"I was thinking today about how much I actually like Bach and his cohorts as villains. I like how absolutely sure they are that they are in the right. How they aren't caricatures of villains, evil for evil's sake, but rather seem to think they're the heroes of their own story. I like the moral ambiguity of it, and it's really rather excellent writing. Which got me to thinking...

***What if the Soul Society are the bad guys?***

Think about their society. They have a rigid social class system, the only way to break free of which is to become a warrior. There is extreme poverty in the lower districts of the Rokkungai, and for what? There is an army of powerful warrior-magicians in the Seireitei: why would there be extreme wealth and poverty in the spirit world?



And then there's their no-nonsense *annihilation* of the Quincies, and all the recent details that have been brought into the history of the Gotei 13 by Bach's little monologue. Man, the Shinigami really sound like bastards....

Now, I know we're all anime/manga fans and we all have the attention of span of cats, but remember, until the end of the ""Invading Soul Society"" arc, the Shinigami were the *bad-guys*. During the ""save Rukia"" arc, we repeatedly see the dark side of the Shinigami. Don't you remember how terrible they were when they were the antagonists? The shinigami are arrogant, political, and extremely destructive beings. They allow beings like Mayuri Kurotsuchi to be *captains* (he straight-up slaughtered hundreds of citizens in the Rokkungai to keep the worlds at balance). Yes, there are plenty of good Shinigami too, but taken as a whole, it's a seriously mixed bag, and a good lot of them are straight terrible.

And then Aizen talked about the ""Spirit King"" as a monster. He and Urahara discuss how it's a necessary compromise, and Aizen says something about how he thinks of the world not in terms of how it is, but how it should be. Everything Aizen was doing, as far as Aizen was concerned, was for the greater good. He believed he had the moral authority and imperative to take down the Spirit King. And the Shinigami did everything they could to protect the status quo. Hell, the only Shinigami Aizen  killed during the entire arc was Gin, even though he easily could have destroyed pretty much everyone. We chalked that up to bad writing, but in the current arc, they're dying one after the next....

Which brings us to the current arc. Once again, the Shinigami are under attack. This time it's by a force that could just be seeking retribution for the cruelty of the Shinigami in the past, but that doesn't seem to be all they're after.

Originally, the Shinigami were villains. They did bad things and we saw them as bad-guys. The only reason we forgot that was because, for a while, there were the Arrancar to worry about. Now the Arrancar have been taken out, and the Shinigami are getting their comeuppance for their destruction of the Quincies a thousand years ago, but there also seems to be something deeper.

Could we all be rooting for the wrong side?

1363183385.0	1a7r6b	Origins of Ichigo's Powers (Bleach 530 Spoilers)	pandaclawz	60	7	79	"Okay, we're introduced to a new hollow creature that has a mask incredibly similar to Ichigo's full-on hollow mode, and it's probably the first Vasto Lorde Soul Society encountered. In fact, it looks like the first incarnation of the mask, plus horns, sans the red markings. This would explain the explanation we got earlier in the series that a Vasto Lorde can outpower a Captain (in this case it's Isshin). It helps that it's Ice Boy who's explaining it, since he was one of Isshin's seated officers. It would also explain why the silhouette we saw has this hollow's mask type. Then you have the blade arms. Look familiar? Looks exactly like Ichigo's 2nd and most recent bankai form.

Now let's get started with Ichigo's powers.

1. Masaki, his mother, is a Quincy. Ichigo's Quincy powers came from her.

2. Masaki was most likely attacked by a hollow some time during her Quincy training. There's Ichigo's Fullbring powers.

3. Shinigami powers. Now here's where things get a little complicated in my hypothesis. I don't think it's just a matter of being a child of Shinigami and Quincy blood...in fact, I'll even go as far to say that the powers are incompatible with one another; you're either one or the other. In any case, Masaki chooses Isshin over Ryuu, Ryuu wants her to be happy, and he lets her go with him. After all, in 530, he does have that concern about her happiness.

In any case, in Chapter 241, Ryuken tells Isshin that he restored Uruyu's Quincy powers. Isshin remarks that Ryuken is a shitty dad, to which the Quincy responds ""Just trying to one-up you"". Isshin's response: ""Yeah...I get it"". (Earlier in the conversation, Ryuken calls Isshin ""Kurosaki"" and he's surprised, saying that it's first time he's addressed by that name. So 188 chapters later, Kubo reveals the foreshadowing of Isshin taking on Masaki's name D:!!!) 

Anyway, what does this tell us? Isshin probably passed his powers on to Ichigo when he was just a young boy, or he passed them to Masaki because of some future injury or complicated pregnancy that can threaten both her and her child's life. I'm guessing it's a transfer to Ichigo. This would explain why Isshin lost his powers and was in hiding. Rukia was going to be executed for doing that. But what does this have to do with the new hollow? Other than the fact that it shares a blade form and mask form with Ichigo, there's the factor of...

**The rain**

It rains whenever this hollow attacks, and we all know that hollows are created out of despair. When Ichigo's in a state of despair, it rains in his mind-universe thing. It's probably bound to his soul, or at least was imprinted there, and Isshin passed his powers on to Ichigo in order to suppress the hollow from manifesting again. Zangetsu hates the rain, remember? And he'd do anything to stop the rain from falling in Ichigo's soul.

Then Byakuya stabs him through the soul where the Shinigami powers are kept. Shit. Urahara probably figured that it's only a matter of time before that crazy hollow creature returns, so he formulates a plan to stop this from happening. Because he's Urahara. And he's a mad scientist. And he's only better than Mayori in the fact that he's not an outward psychopath. He figures by this time Ichigo's old enough to draw on the Shinigami powers given to him by Isshin (since he lost the powers given to him by Rukia, whose powers eventually returned. So did Isshin's but it took much longer because the process was probably very different). So Urahara expedites the process by severing Ichigo's soul chain and forcing him to go Shinigami or go Hollow. That's also why they had to use such crazy hardcore spells to completely annihilate Ichigo in case he went full-on hollow. If he was just a regular person and soul with no reiatsu left, he would've just become a regular hollow. No. They treated him as an incredibly powerful and terrible threat. This would very much so suggest that Ichigo IS that hollow we're introduced to. And most likely one of Aizen's experiments.

**TL;DR**

Ichigo gets Fullbring and Quincy powers from his mom, Shinigami powers from his dad (explains Isshin's loss of power), and maaaaybe is the crazy hollow we're just introduced to on the account of the blade arms being similar to Tensa Zangetsu^2 and same mask form.

1365000552.0	1bl8o6	(SPOILERS) Theory on Masaki	Monory	62	4	61	"After this week's chapter we see that Masaki is extremely strong as a quincy. This makes her death against Grand Fisher extremely questionable. After all, if she can throw on blut vein and take a hit from the hollow in chapter 532 (does it have a name yet?), how can she possibly die to grand fisher?

After reading [this interview](http://www.animenation.net/forums/showthread.php?t=246152) by Kubo I think it is pretty obvious what happened. In chapter 19 we see Ichigo chases Grand Fisher's lure, possibly falls into the river, then blacks out and wakes up with Masaki dead on top of him. We know that when Ichigo gets in trouble (maybe he was drowning in the river, maybe Grand Fisher injured him), his inner hollow comes out in full force. We also know that Grand Fisher is no where to be seen when Ichigo wakes up, which makes no sense. If Masaki died Grand Fisher would have then killed Ichigo as well. I think it is more likely that Ichigo went berserk, scared off/injured Grand Fisher, and killed his own mother. I expect a flashback soon just before [this scene](http://i6.mangapanda.com/bleach/19/bleach-1586027.jpg) with Masaki hugging hollow Ichigo similar to [this scene](http://i997.mangapanda.com/bleach/532/bleach-4026467.jpg), except this time she doesn't have the heart to kill her own son so he kills her and they collapse together."	t5_2rk7q	True

Isshin, as far as anybody should be concerned, was a Captain (most likely during the *Divisions* period).

Let's examine a few facts here, for a second.

* He is retardedly (not a real word, mind you) strong, everyone should know this.

* Cut down the Grand Fisher in half lengthwise with **one slash**

* Kept up with Aizen **without even using Engetsu's Shikai** form

* [Finger flick against Aizen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdaLYvF6jTY)

* Held back the Kōtotsu inside the Dangai with **sheer reiatsu for THREE MONTHS**

* Has extensive knowledge of Shinigami powers and their Bankai 

    Remember, just the ability to unleash a Zanpakuto's Bankai takes an immense amount of skill, experience, and training; let alone master it (supported by the fact that he has attempted to learn **Engetsu's supreme power, Final Getsuga Tenshō**, whether he succeeded or not is still unknown)

A quote from chapter 162:
&gt; Only the strongest Shinigami can use it. It is also the ultimate technique of a Zanpakutō. Even the Four noble families, whose members are always exceptionally talented, have a member capable of Bankai only every few generations. Those who achieve Bankai always have remarkable roles in the history of Soul Society.

[source](http://www.mangareader.net/94-616-8/bleach/chapter-162.html)

* The Gotei 13 respects him. Remember how he and Urahara convinced ALL the Captains (Including Yamamoto, nonetheless) of the Gotei-13 to give some of their power so that Ichigo can regain his Shinigami abilities back?

* He wears a tattered **Captain's Haori**

Now, that last bullet is the most controversial. Yeah sure, it could just be some white cloth resembling a Captain's Haori, but let's think outside of the box for a second here.

Let's say that it IS just some sort of Haori replica, wouldn't this be a crime (Impersonating an Officer)? Remember, Captains are a VERY significant part of Soul Society, that's why they are chosen VERY carefully. And for an ordinary Shinigami to impersonate one would be a great offense (This is traditional Japanese culture, people).

Also, let's not forget that he got exiled.

**He got exiled.**

Now, why do people get exiled? Because they probably committed an act against their nation (Which in this case, is Soul Society).

Okay, so why did he get exiled then (Exact reason is still unknown)?

If he did something against Soul Society, why didn't they just execute him? Like what Soul Society planned to do with Rukia (A non-Captain, an ordinary Shinigami, albeit of royal blood).

Now then.....

Let's say you run a big group, and some random asshole rebels against your government, wouldn't you just kill him then-and-there?

But what if we replaced that random asshole with someone significant, like a close friend of yours or one of your most loyal guards. You wouldn't kill them now, would you? You would send them away in hope that they would some day come back to you, am I correct?

I want more flairs, for starters, it amazes me that we have yet to recieve Espada flairs (Which could simply be their numbers in that special text font that is used, so extremely easy! ( ---  http://imgur.com/3maym ---).


And flairs for all the main characters we all love!

.


Aizen, he's one of the biggest characters in the bleach universe, even after his defeat by Ichigo (which I'm sure he staged, because he's Aizen).

.


Gin; Originally thought to be the bad guy, only to be ""revealed"" to simply be a simple follower of Aizen (&lt;3), and then REALLY revealed to be one of the good guy by betraying Aizen (trying to kill him and whatnot) only to die in his failed attempt to revenge Rankigu, almost everyone loves him (me included).

.


Urahara, almost all people love him, a lot of fans have swords from the different captains or an Urahara hat, a flair consisting of his hat can't really be that hard to achieve?

.


Yoruchi, a cat flair, so simple and easy to fix and everyone would know who the flair is for.

.


Adding 11 flairs for the Arrancar (0-10) - or at LEAST 0-9 - and one for Urahara and Yoruchi does not seem like it can be that hard.

.


Addionally, I believe a flair for varying organizations would be fitting aswell;

A flair for Visored, Xcution, Hollows in general, Vandenreich, Bount (not many likes the fillers, but still) and Quincy (gotta seperate the good-guys Quincy from Vandenreich).



I believe that the flairs for the Espada is mandatory, a lot of people love characters like Starrk, Grimmjow, Ulquiorra and Harribel and a lot have had bigger influence so far than most Captains of the Gotei 13 (My second favorite guy in Bleach is Starrk). And I'm sure there's a few fans out there for people like Nnoitra and Baraggan.


I know we're not that big of a community, but I really hope there's enough people rooting for this to happen.

In this case, however, Minazuki's bankai has nothing except torrents of acid/illusion(?) blood going for it. And then we have Unohana saying [''My entire legacy I leave in your hands''](http://mangafox.me/manga/bleach/v58/c527/10.html) to Kenpachi, and in the background we see her letting go of Minazuki.

The question is this: Is her letting go of her zanpaktou symbolic of her letting go of the title, or does she actually mean ''Here, have Minazuki and wield it and show all the fans the power of its bankai''? 

It's also interesting that Kenny's zanpaktou woke up at that *specific* moment.

Also, maybe only a true Kenpachi is allowed to wield Minazuki, and the the literal transfer is what makes the next person a Kenpachi?

Ichigo is the son of a otherworldly being with a sword that fires spiritual energy blasts, and (allegedy) a human woman that is part of a group of ""priests"" that are archers firing holy arrows. This plus the fact that Ichigo has an inner demon lead me to realize, Bleach probably started with Kubo asking himself ""what would it be like if [these two](http://loadpaper.com/large/Inuyasha_wallpapers_122.jpg) had a son?""

We already know Kubo was inspired to create the Idea of zanpakuto by tessaiga and tenseiga. 


It seems like [this](http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/H%C5%8Dgyoku) and [this](http://inuyasha.wikia.com/wiki/Shikon_no_Tama) aren't too far off from each other.

Call me crazy, maybe its just the lack of sleep and/or that Inuyasha just aired on toonami like 20 minutes ago.

But I think bleach abstractly started as Kubo writing an Inuyasha fan fic, then built his own world on top of it. 

I know its crazy and I expect a wave of downvotes for daring to suggest the manliest of shonen could be inspired by a bishonen anime, but if I'm so crazy, explain this! [Meidō ***Zangetsu***ha](http://inuyasha.wikia.com/wiki/Meid%C5%8D_Zangetsuha)"	t5_2rk7q	True

And even if it's hilariously bad, submit it! Most of you are Photoshop Swamis though so they'll probably all be great. But don't think this has to be ""the best of the best."" Anything's cool here! Just for fun, ya know?

What if Ichigo doesn't have all these powers because he's the main character, but instead he's the main character ***because*** of these powers. He's quite possibly the only entity to exist in the Bleach universe to transcend so many power boundaries.

Lets look at what we know about the different races involved:

* **Quincy** and **Fullbringers** are subclasses of **Humans**. The only thing special about Quincies is their inherent reiatsu manipulation skills while Fullbringers can simply bring out the 'souls' that reside in inanimate objects. They're still mere humans.

* **Vizards** are a subclass of **Shinigami** who have transcended the boundary between Shinigami and Hollow, obtaining immense power(Shinigami/Hollow hybrids) and now stand in a plane that exists between the two. One has to be a Shinigami originally to be a Vizard.

* **Arrancar** are a subclass of **Hollows** who have transcended the boundary between Hollow and Shinigami, obtaining immense power(Hollow/Shinigami hybrids) and now stand in a plane that exists parallel to the Vizards. One has to be a Hollow originally to be an Arrancar.

\* A note about Ichigo's Vasto Lorde status: Vasto Lorde refers not to another subclass of Hollows but instead to a Menos' power. As their power increases (by consuming more and more of their fellow Menos) they assume more humanoid shapes (reason for this is unknown). The ones that look almost completely human in form are the strongest and classified as Vasto Lorde. Ichigo's Hollow powers meet or even exceed this criterion. When his Inner Hollow takes full control of his body he transforms into a Menos. During his training with the Vizards his form is that of an extremely high-class Adjucas. It's humanoid in form but it's still much more akin to a beast or monster. When his Hollow assumes control in the fight against Ulquiorra we see that this form is completely different. It is literally Ichigo's body with more violent features (claws and those tufts of fur) as well as a mask. It is about as human as it can get allowing us to assume that Ichigo has reached the same level of power as the Vasto Lordes.

With all this being said, Ichigo is simply a **Human** and a **Shinigami**.

He can access the powers of the three different kinds of souls: Human, Hollow, and Shinigami. Perhaps this is the reason he is at the center of everything. Being linked to both sides of a war will almost always pull you into it. It makes sense that Ichigo, a transcendental being, would be at the center of fundamental conflicts between the elements that comprise his very soul. That's my opinion."	t5_2rk7q	True

The first one we have all known is the caring, super-healer that is in charge of the 4th division. She has been shown to avoid conflict when possible (When she was in Hueco Mundo vs the tree-army guy).  Even when she was present at critical event that she could have helped stop if she as fierce as we know she is now (when Aizen's true intentions were revealed).  

Yet this new side, this darker side, shows nothing but a lust for death that rivals Zaraki's. She is renowned as the fiercest criminal that soul society has ever seen. She was compared to near Yammamoto levels of strength. So why wouldn't she act? Simple, because she either:

* Made a pledge that she wouldn't kill another soul until she had saved as many as she had already slain.

or 

* She has such an insatiable need to fight and kill that if she were to reveal that side she wouldn't be able to stop herself from slaying her comrades as well.  Which is why she had to go to the vast empty basement of the prison in the latest chapter

My theory is that she was taken down by the Zero Squad member with the hot springs and Old Man Yamma and converted to a healer when she was forced to face the damages she had enacted. Her guilt is what led her to become such a phenomenal healer, pledging that she couldn't cleanse herself of her guilt until she had saved as many lives as she had taken. This is why she didn't use her powers in those previous incidences, so she wouldn't kill Chad or her Lt. or other comrades. 

Kubo has said in interviews that her ""true powers will be revealed"" in this chapter, and that the manta ray thing from the rescue Rukia arc was not its true form.  I believe that she is doing something similar to Yumichika's strategy to hide the true nature of his Zanpakto.  She is referring to it in a different way, bringing about a different, less deadly form. I don't know what the other form will look like, but I'm sure it will be horrifyingly powerful.

Hi, /r/bleach.

SO!

The average /r/bleach user is:

* Male (Only 15% of you are female)

* Between the ages of 18 and 24 (majority of females were the same age)

* Whose favorite color is blue (then green, then red.)

* Whose favorite posts are (good) theories, tournament posts, and chapter discussions.

* Whose least favorite posts are (shitty) fan art, cosplay, and AMV's.

* Whose favorite captain is [**this gentleman.**](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090414053734/bleach/en/images/b/be/Shunsui1.jpg)

* And whose favorite espada is [**this awesome guy.**](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100407103525/bleach/en/images/0/00/Ulquiorra_Cifer_Number_Revealed.png)

**Now let's talk about some changes I saw suggested.**

* A good majority of you (probably 60-70% or so) requested more tournaments. So I've begun putting together a roster for a Low-Tier Tournament. Fraccions, Vice Captains, More Fullbringers, etc. Look forward to a post from that, kinda unsure about a few people, gonna run some by ya.

* Someone else suggested we add spoiler tags like /r/naruto has. We already have them, Xyphious implemented them a little while ago, just mark your post NSFW and it'll show up as spoilers on here.

* Somebody else answered ""Rape"" for every question. Please seek help.

* One person did option up something I thought was interesting. I noticed a good spike in Novelty Accounts recently, and somebody suggested we open up a weekly role-playing thread. Any interest in that?

* Another cool idea was a weekly discussion thread with a random topic. Could be ""what if"" scenarios (What if Ichigo never used Mugetsu? etc.) Just a what do you think would happen sorta thing. Just tell me what you're interested in, typing ""Any interest?"" over and over seems repetitive.

* Also got requests to recruit more users. Now I have no idea where to even begin on that. I don't think a community of 5,600 members could be considered a ""new"" community, so I have no idea how to advertise ourselves. If you guys have any ideas I'm all ears.

* Also got a request to stop the same questions re-appearing over and over. So in light of that, I will start making a FAQ. It'll have power levels, links to the wiki, misconceptions, general lore, and manga chapters/anime filler episodes. Anything else you want added? Lemme know.

* People suggested rotating banners. I personally like the banner, but if you guys want a new banner, if you make it I'll put it up there. Right now we have a Starrk v Nel, but if somebody makes one I'll implement it. Unless you want me to make it. In which case, don't expect a lot, but I've gotten a little bit better at photoshop. And when I say ""a little bit better"" what I mean is, I've figured out how to work the layers aspect of it. Huzzah for small successes!

* To the person who askd us to take down the banner and side bar image so it doesn't look like he/she's browsing at work: go to Preferences &gt; Display Options &gt; and then unclick ""allow reddits to show me custom styles."" That should give everything the default reddit look. I'm pretty sure anyways.

That's all the ones that stuck out to me. If I missed yours and you thought it was good comment here or PM me and we'll talk it over!

1375813116.0	1jtrr0	Manga Tuesday #3!! Which means we're half way through the hiatus! (Break for applause)	SynysterScene	59	11	35	"Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

Today's manga is kinda well known and old, but it may be something you've over looked.

Today's manga of the week is **Samurai Champloo!**

Now you may be thinking to yourself ""Synyster, you're an idiot. Everyone's already seen Samurai Champloo."" And yes, it's very popular, but for good reason. It's an awesome show, and if ya haven't watched it already: **DO IT.** It's on Netflix for those of you that have it.

***BUT!***

Did you know the manga has an alternate story line? They go do different things. It's like an extended adventure for those of you who watched the anime! For those who didn't I'd recommend watching the anime first.

So for a quick overview:

Written by Shinichirō Watanabe in 2004, this manga follows the story of [Mugen](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120619055156/champloo/images/a/a1/Mugen_fighting_style.jpg), [Jin](http://azureanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/jin_2.jpg), and [Fuu](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120621040933/champloo/images/b/ba/Fuu.jpg) as they traverse Edo Japan to find a Samurai who smells of sunflowers. Mugen and Jin meet by trying to kill one another in the restaurant Fuu works at. After being locked up and tortured, Fuu helps them escape from their execution. And after a long talk and a coin flip, they reluctantly leave with her to help her find this samurai who smells of sunflowers and decide to put their fight to the death on hold.

And there's an episode where they all get really high. A couple, actually. 

Also please be sure to be nice and say hi to the mods of /r/SamuraiChamploo while they're here hanging out, answering questions, just doin' stuff. And while you're at it, why dontcha go over and check out their subreddit too! :D

http://www.mangapanda.com/94-609-6/bleach/chapter-155.html  
And it reminded me of someone saying about how that Zero squad seamstress may have made the captain's pretty pink cloak, and had a thought. We did find out that he has a pretty OP/dangerous bankai in the SS arc, and we know Kubo has said we'll learn it's secret in the 100YBW too. This shot sorta made me think that the clothes have some form of reiatsu compression/stabilisation aspect.  
Think about it, each member of the RG developed something right?  
So far we have Zan, Gigai, healing techniques/springs, and now possibly something to do with the Shinigami Uniform (and ""exceedingly expensive"" Captain haoris?).  
  
Any thoughts?  
I mean it makes sense that she invented something to do with the uniforms, and that they have some special property. After all, we know she's been to the R&amp;D labs in the past (which means RG have been to SS in the past 100 years... interesting), and they did make Kenpachi's eyepatch.. The way he appears to be sheilding Nanao (though it may just be stylized), and the fact he has moved on to becoming the CC... Well, I like to speculate.

Shunpo Edit:  
Anomalies that support/link with this:  
Yama always threw his off  
Isshin kept his  
Soifon/Yoruichi and Shunko  
Arrancar wearing similar clothing (Yes it's obviously just stylistic/so they can be humanoid, but Aizen was trying to create his own Royal Guard - so to speak - to gain access to the kings domain, does it seem farfetched that he would attempt to mirror their creations? Zan? Clothing? They have regen, so no need to heal.)"	t5_2rk7q	True
1372684220.0	1hf9nd	Things you know, yet don't always think about... Bleach thoughts... [Spoilers]	Kasztan	56	7	35	"@FIXED THE LINKS.

Few things, that crossed my mind while re-reading the chapters. We all know that Kubo has to make up some things to fit along the way, but aren't they maybe something deeper? Like [this moment.](http://i33.mangapanda.com/bleach/404/bleach-2400195.jpg)

* If Aizen knew all along who Isshin Shiba was, why call him Kurosaki Isshin? Did Kubo just ""didn't want to spoil""? It wouldn't really change anything, or more likely - it would be a thought-maker for more and more chapters. Or did he just came up with the decent family on the way?

Ichigo was a test subject, FROM THE BEGINNING. It was Aizen's master plan, him. 

* What if the whole final fight was a test? Why was there no anger, no desire to be free along the Vandenreich, or even place them under hypnosis and run? **That's because ""he"" created something, that even Hogyoku couldn't. Maybe and maybe not, Hogyoku was in the godly dimension.** And if even Hogyoku couldn't beat something he created, something that right now is at peace and at the peak of his powers - he's never going to lose. Maybe it's not the Quincy, that'll be his final opponent...

* There is something serious going on at the backstage, with the people who ""know."" Yhwach probably knows about the Soul King, so did Yamamoto and Urahara. Urahara probably even seen him personally, as he ""analyzed the water in the Blood Pond Hell"" That's how he probably also created Hogyoku. Or was he send there, because he created it?

Zangetsu contacted Ichigo already. And I mean the sword, the inner power. Not Yhwach, not Hollow Ichigo. The sword itself, the ""inner Shinigami""

* As Zanpaktous are essentialy ""hollows"" (Heh, the pun.) that Shinigami fill with their own souls, they basically are the personification of themselves. So when did Ichigo basically talk with himself? 

* [I think this is the moment he's talking with the true, yet supressed Zangetsu.](http://i33.mangapanda.com/bleach/221/bleach-13693.jpg)
Look at the last panel, ""Kenpachi? Who is that?"" - and [most importantly, something that Yhwach despised, and desired Ichigo to protect from.](http://i25.mangapanda.com/bleach/221/bleach-13695.jpg) ""Did i say you need a reason, for battle?""


Hollow also tried to teach Ichigo something. He played the role of Asauchi. It's the same basis, that Nimaiya tried to teach both Ichigo and Renji.

* [Doesn't that remind you of something?](http://i21.mangapanda.com/bleach/523/bleach-3846763.jpg) Like let's just say, [this?](http://i6.mangapanda.com/bleach/220/bleach-1589277.jpg) It was the hollow, that became the one which cornered Ichigo, making him the one which pushed his evolution even further. (And since he was a soul from the depths of Ichigo himself, he ""mastered"" Zangetsu earlier because there were no shackles. The real power of Zangetsu at that time, [can be seen here, as it's just a single ""Getsuga Tenshou""](http://i8.mangapanda.com/bleach/219/bleach-1589281.jpg) And now compare it [to Ichigo's Getsuga](http://i35.mangapanda.com/bleach/219/bleach-1589274.jpg). Another reason why i believe that is true, it's the color of Getsuga. Whenever Hollow powers were involved, the texture of the reiatsu was black. Why was this Getsuga white then?

Some of them are quite weird, so I figured I'd do a list of all of the Sternritter and how to pronounce their names!

| Name | Pronunciation | Notes |
| :- | :- | :- |
| Yhwach / Juhabach | Yuh-VAHK / YUU-hah-bahk | Pronunciation of ""Yhwach"" is debatable since it's so unrelated to the Japanese name. Yuh-vahk is the closest to the Japanese pronunciation while matching the spelling of the English name. ""Bahk"" like Bach, the composer. |
| Jugram Haschwald / Haschwalth | YUU-gram HUSH-vuhlt | German pronunciation. Both are pronounced the same. |
| Äs Nödt | Ays Noet | German pronunciation. Ö is a bit like ear in ""earl"". |
| Cang Du | Tsahng DO | Chinese. ""Du"" is half-way between ""du"" and ""do"". Chuck 蒼都 (his Chinese name) into Google Translate and listen from Chinese. |
| Quilge Opie | KILL-gay OH-pi | Dunno. Kubo being weird. |
| BG9 | Bay-gay-noyn | German pronunciation. Not sure why Kubo decided to use German pronunciation for two letters and a number, but he did. |
| Driscoll Berci | DRIHS-kol BUR-chi | Italian...? I have no idea. |
| Meninas McAllon | Mi-NEEN-ya Mac-AL-on | McAllon comes from ""macaroon"" but is pronounced with different emphasis. |
| Berenice Gabrielli | Beh-reh-NI-kuh Gah-bri-EH-li |  |
| Jerome Guizbatt | Je-ROAM GHIZ-bat |  |
| Mask De Masculine | Mahsk Duh Mah-skew-LEEN | French or maybe English imitation of Spanish. Not Spanish anyway, for some reason. |
| NaNaNa Najahkoop | Nah-nah-nah NAH-ja-koop | Very descriptive. |
| Giselle Gewelle | Juh-ZELL Juh-WELL | Gewelle comes from ""jewel"" but is pronounced with different emphasis. |

1372165911.0	1h19ug	Ukitake's zanpakuto and neuron cells	IllusiveMan21	61	14	24	"The shikai of Ukitake reminds me of a neuron cell. The right hand sword absorbs energy which spreads out all over the sword, travels along the chain with the tags (not sure what they're called) which light up in sequence to the other sword which fires the energy along with some of Ukitake's.

The neuron cell (when it receives a signal) has the signal spread out passively over the cell until it reaches the axon hillock, where the axons pass on the signal one by one. Also, just like his shikai, the axons (or tags) are not attached directly to each other. The part about Ukitake adding his own energy is related to the intake of potassium ions into the axon in order to continue the signal. 

Personally, I think this is related to his sickness, with him having some sort of illness of the brain, however this is just speculation.

On a final note, the command of his zanpakuto is All Waves, Rise now and Become my Shield, Lightning, Strike now and Become my Blade, which would be related to the electrical signals between neurons."	t5_2rk7q	True

Also Unohana refers to her ""sin"" as leaving her son in district 80. I don't know, this might just be a aluminum foil hat theory.

But here's my take.

**I think her Zanpakuto's weak.**

I think her power, the thing that drives every other captain in Soul Society bat-crap scared of her, is just herself.

Yeah, that's right; I'm calling it right now. She doesn't use super flashy, flame breathing, lightning conjuring, earth shaking abilities; she just has monstrous strength and fighting prowess.


It makes total sense. If you come to think of it, the 11th squad is known for their brute force and brutality; it just wouldn't fit in if she had some sort of flashy Zanpakuto.


Zaraki Kenpachi stated that she was the only one he admired, at least something like that; we know that Zaraki kind of hates kidou type stuff (as the flower hair guy from 11th stated in the past), why? Because his idol, Unohana, never used stupid, pretty, flashy kidou shit; she just owned.


Unohana, in my opinion, was changed by Tenjirō Kirinji. We all know that Tenjirō is a powerful healer. My theory is, that during the past, our lovely but crazy Unohana Retsu would go on a rampage; sometimes hurting a lot of people that were not meant to be hurt. This in turn angered (or at least affected) Tenjirō, leading him to heal the innocent people that Unohana hurt. Finally getting to the point where he, himself, forced Unohana to learn how to heal by teaching her; so that Unohana may heal those she hurt.


Also, Kyouraku asked Unohana to teach Zaraki Kenpachi ""The art of killing""; now that's saying something.



Remember; Unohana is no magic-conjuring flower child, she is a barbarian.

But you guys can still look forward to the low tier tournament I'm putting together, I'll put the list out of fighters in a few days so you guys can look it over and decide who you want put in/taken out.

Also, good afternoon, /r/bleach.

Without any further adieu, let's get going!

[**Coyote Starrk**](http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Coyote_Starrk)

**Pros:**

* Has an infinite number of self-repairing, homing nuke wolves that don't stop until they get their target.

* Can fire ceros from anywhere on his body, has the fastest cero charge time of all espada.

* Speed rivals teleportation

* Intelligent enough to figure out Kyoraku's games and Ukitake's zanpakuto without any help from them.

***VS***

[**Gin Ichimaru**](http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Gin_Ichimaru) 

**Pros:**

* Has an extremely long range with his zanpakuto

* Bankai is a poison that destroys cells

* Kept Ichigo at bay with little effort

* Can use techniques such as Buto: Renjin to attack a wide area

Good luck on all your finals!

Have a good one, guys. :)

**EDIT:** New rule. If either Starrk or Gin hits 50 downvotes (both are around 35-40) **every 5 downvotes counts as 1 upvote.** It's really messing up people without RES, they can't see it. Right now Starrk is leading, but you'd never know because you guys downvoted both fighters way too much. This is the solution. 9 more for Starrk and we go to 5:1. 21 more for Gin and we do the same thing."	t5_2rk7q	True

http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zoGT8QmSbIg/UbFXCEm0ehI/AAAAAAAASSk/pYcK8abgUgY/011.png?imgmax=2000

It always seemed like such a discrepancy that Ichigo beat Kenpachi before achieving Bankai when later, Kenpachi defeats Nnoitra, the latter being easily able to beat up a tired Ichigo in Bankai.  In the link above, there is an aura surrounding Ichigo resembling a hollow that appears after Ichigo asks for more power from Old Man Zangetsu.  

OMZ mentioned in the current arc that he had been suppressing real Zangetsu's influence on Ichigo's power the whole time.  My theory is OMZ gave Ichigo more power by temporarily weakening his suppression of real Zangetsu, and the hollow in Ichigo's spiritual aura is actually the real Zangetsu.  Another thing I'd like to mention is that I'm not aware of any situation besides this fight where a Zanpakuto gave more power to its Shinigami besides its base Shikai/Bankai abilities (correct me if I'm wrong).

Also, I am aware that Unohana said Kenpachi got stronger after being on the brink of death (like a Saiyan) which also helped him defeat Nnoitra.  I'm just trying to resolve a large difference in power between Shikai Ichigo and the 5th Espada.

tl;dr Ichigo got enough power to defeat Kenpachi when OMZ stopped suppressing the real Zangetsu (to an extent)."	t5_2rk7q	True

So shes going to need constant protection which is why I don't understand the argument thats she's useless.  She has a purpose and she generally fulfills it.  

That's why I liked the Hueco mundo arc more than the Soul Society arc.  Rukia is a decent fighter and I know she was weak at the time because of her gigai and aizen and yeah yeah.  Story-wise and in terms of plot it makes sense.  But to me it just never felt natural.

However orihime seems like someone who could believably get kidnapped. and I don't see that as a positive or negative thing it just fits her character role.

And to be quite Honest I love the scene where she's standing over Ichigo before she leaves for Hueco Mundo for one defend-able  reason. Kubo actually made a decision for a love interest for ichigo instead of the generic ""which person will the main character pick? could be any of these girls am I right audience?"" animes and other stories tend to use.

The fullbringer arc is part of the story, and you can't just cut it out and expect to understand everything in the end. Kubo wouldn't have spent 50 chapters on it if it was completely useless. Bleach is now returning back to it's high flying self, but every story has to have a break and a bridge to connect the plot points. The fullbringer does exactly that. 

I'd bet money the fullbringer arc will play a major plot part in the story sometime in the future. It's a necessary part of the story. So yes, it's worth reading and continuing on from there. There are still dozens of unanswered questions and material left to cover. Leaving now would mean you miss half the fun.

1351167570.0	1228rz	The Bleach Theory of Everything - a theory on the relationship between all Bleach characters (SPOILERS)	Andygoesrawr	59	13	41	"**Forewarning:** This post references a lot of stuff from throughout Bleach including the most recent chapter, and as such contains spoilers. It's also very long and I apologise.

.

**Introduction:**

Hello! I've been reading people's theories about Bleach recently, especially with the latest chapter having Ichigo use Blut Vene, and I thought I should express my theories about WHY Ichigo always seems to gain everyone's powers magically and HOW this is possible.

The majority of my theorycrafting has gone into trying to explain how the powers of various characters relate to each other, and how these characters got these powers.

.

**The Model:**

First of all: I've decided to create [a little diagram showing my theory of  the categories of all powers and their relationships to one another](http://i.imgur.com/W8bfo.png).

Also, for the purposes of this theory, assume that ""Hollow powers"" refers to the Hollow body powers, such as Ichigo's Hollow form, and also assume that Orihime is a Fullbringer (very likely).

.

**The Relationship Between Resurreccion and Fullbring:**

The only particularly radical aspect of my diagram it is the fact that I've grouped Resurreccion and Fullbring together. A lot of people don't seem to particularly share this view with me, but I feel it's quite obvious: Characters throughout the series have continuously referenced the fact that Fullbring powers are Hollow powers manifested inside a physical object, and that a Resurreccion is an Arrancar's Hollow powers manifested inside a physical object (a sword, in most cases - Aaroniero and Starrk are the only exceptions seen). Therefore, I feel it's only natural to assume that these powers are one in the same. HOWEVER, a Resurreccion clearly includes Hollow body powers, which explains why Fullbrings are not Hollow-like in appearance, and why Arrancars are only Hollow-like once in their Ressurreccion - they've simply combined their ""Fullbring"" with their Hollow powers inside their spiritual object (their ""Zanpakuto"").

.

**The Relationship Between Zanpakuto and Fullbring:**

Another aspect of the Fullbring which I've semi-explained in the diagram is the fact that both the Fullbring and a Zanpakuto are the same type of powers (being spiritual object powers), and therefore they can be combined to work together. A great example of this is the fact that Kugo was able to combine his Fullbring with his Zanpakuto, and achieve a perfect working combination of them. While it's not entirely clear what his Zanpakuto's abilities are and what his Fullbring's abilities are as they've always been combined as far as we have seen, we can see that his Bankai is able to flow perfectly through his Fullbring, through the appearance of the ""X"" shape on his back in his Bankai which is pink rather than green, meaning it's most likely his Shinigami reiatsu. Another example of the combination of a Zanpakuto and Fullbring is Ichigo once his Shinigami powers are restored. Note: I know that it's not quite his entire Fullbring which has combined with his Zanpakuto, but in the latest chapter it appears as though he can still use his Fullbring, through the way that his Reiatsu flairs off him like it did in his Fullbring's second version.

.

**Just a bit of fun:**

As such, a Quincy/Fullbringer/Shinigami/Hollow hybrid could exist, combining their Hollow powers with their Fullbring and their Fullbring with their spirit weapon and their Zanpakuto, effectively gaining a weapon with one sealed state and possibly two Quincy releases (generally one, the second one being Vollstandig), two Hollow releases (Mask/Fullbring, Full Hollow form/Fullbring - similar to Resurreccion and Segunda Etapa but don't shoot me) and two Shinigami releases (Shikai, Bankai).

.

**Ichigo Post-Dangai and the Final Getsuga Tensho:**

Ichigo's evolution is pretty easily explainable using this model as well: Aizen praised his post-Dangai form as his body having fused with his Zanpakuto, which is explained by the fact that once his Hollow and Shinigami powers had combined, his Bankai was able to flow through his body because of the Hollow body powers, and it was able to flow through his Zanpakuto and the world around him because of his Shinigami object powers.

This ALSO explains why both Ichigo and Isshin were able to achieve the Final Getsuga Tensho, despite Isshin (presumably) not having Hollow powers: the presence of Hollow powers is irrelevent. The Final Getsuga Tensho is simply a Shinigami's Zanpakuto's soul becoming one with the Shinigami's soul, giving a Shinigami access to Zanpakuto powers without being limited by simple ""abilities"". The fact that Tensa Zangetsu decided to combine with Hichigo is irrelevant and unnecessary, but a happy coincidence.

.

**The Fucking Hogyoku:**

Currently the only powers which defy this model are the Hogyoku and its related ""gifts"" (Aizen, the Vizards, Tosen, etc). Fuck the Hogyoku.

.

**TL;DR: All of the powers in Bleach are related, the Fullbring arc was extremely necessary, and Kubo isn't just trolling us.**"	t5_2rk7q	True

Hope you're all doing well!

It's week 4 of the hiatus, and we're all still alive. This is a good sign.

But let's get to this week's manga!

This week's manga is [**Deadman Wonderland.**](http://www.mangapanda.com/666-33035-1/deadman-wonderland/chapter-1.html) Some pretty graphic shit goes down. Don't read fi you're not cool with gore. 

So, pretty much here's what happens:

There's this kid (middle schooler) named Ganta. And Ganta is one unlucky dude, but I'll get to that in a minute. So this kid's just hanging out, watching some commercial for the world's only publicly operated prison called Deadman Wonderland on his iPad or something before class starts, when his friend Mimi comes up and starts talking about god knows what. Just normal conversation stuff. Then his other friends start getting involved, and everyone's having a good time. But shit gets real when class starts. Ganta sees this guy floating in mid air outside the classroom window, in an all red suit...thing. And then he blacks out. When he comes to, everybody's dead. All his friends, everyone. Dead. Deader than any dead thing that has ever died. And standing there smiling is the man in red. He throws a red crystal at Ganta, and he blacks out again and wakes up in the hospital. Seeing as he's the only survivor, he's accused of the crime. And he's then sent to Deadman Wonderland (see what they did there), and eventually learns he's gonna die there. Then he meets this magical girl named Shiro, he's got some magic powers too. It's a long story. BUT REALLY COOL.


So that's this week's manga. And due to popular demand, next week we'll be featuring Beelzebub! :D

Haaaaaaaaaaave a good one!

Isshin Shiba- [Engetsu, a Fire Based Zanpaktou.](http://dailyanimeart.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/isshins-engetsu-burn-shikai.jpg)

Kaien Shiba - [Nejibana, a water based Zanpaktou.](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090905073526/bleachwiki/de/images/f/fe/Bleach_-_155_-_Large_07.jpg)

Kukaku Shiba - the [Reishukaku](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110812183559/bleach/en/images/thumb/1/1c/E24_Kukaku_Ganju_demostrate_orb.jpg/190px-E24_Kukaku_Ganju_demostrate_orb.jpg) and the [Kakaku Ho/Flower Crane Cannon.](http://thumbnails.hulu.com/11/626/44232_145x80_generated__osSvS8f0iUOIKN3ivelhWg.jpg) which are possibly air based inventions? we havn't seen her powers yet though.

Looking at this we can see that elemental based powers/zanpaktou seem to trend within the Shiba clan, and as we saw in the new chapter [ichigos sword seems to be wraped in flames](http://i995.mangareader.net/bleach/541/bleach-4226523.jpg) so looks like its probably a fire based zanpaktou like his fathers, but I was wondering if he would almost be like an ""avatar"" of the shiba clan? once every 5 generations of the clan someones born who's powers hold all the elements? I dunno that sounds a little bit ridiculous and a too much of a rip off of Avatar: The Last Airbender. I also wanted to mention if Yuzu and karin got powers (probably wont) they would possibly be elemental based as well? Or do you guys think think this whole thing  is just a big coincidence?

Also wanted to say you know how all zanpaktou have a phrase said before their names called out, eg: Roar, Zabimaru! Maybe the reason Ichigo didnt do this was because it wasnt his true zanpaktou?

EDIT: This just came to me aswell perhaps the reason ichigo is permanently in Shikai is to do with Juha? So maybe he wont always be in shikai from now on?

Let's start with Byakuya.  He appears to take Ichigo's somewhat-girlfriend (Rukia) back to his realm (SS) on the orders of his superior (Yamamoto), along with a subordinate officer (Renji), who gets his ass kicked by Ichigo.  Then Ichigo, along with his friends (Uryū, Chad, and Orihime), travels through a portal (Senkaimon) to said realm to get her back.  Once there, he infiltrates Byakuya's HQ (Seireitei) with the help of a local (Ganju a/o Hanatarō).  Inside, he fights a 3rd seat (Ikkaku), a lieutenant (Renji), and a captain (Kenpachi). Finally, he battles Byakuya and unleashes a new hidden power (bankai/hollow transformation) in which he wins. SS then gets intercepted by a more powerful character (Aizen).

Ulquiorra makes his first appearance in the living world along with his subordinate (Yammy), who gets his arm cut off. He then returns to his realm (Hueco Mundo) and comes back to capture Ichigo's somewhat-girlfriend (Orihime) on the orders of his superior (Aizen). Ichigo, along with his friends (Uryū, Chad, Renji, and Rukia), use a portal (Garganta) to enter said realm and infiltrate Ulquiorra's base (Las Noches) with the help of locals (Nel, Pesche, and Dondochakka).  Once inside, he fights a bunch of arrancar, a privaron espada (Dordoni), and another espada (Grimmjow). [I'm leaving out Ichigo's first battle with Ulquiorra in which he actually died] Grimmjow then gets intercepted by another Espada (Nnoitra). Then, Ichigo fights Ulquiorra for a second time, and unleashes a hidden power (all-out Vasto Lorde holy shit transformation) and defeats Ulquiorra."	t5_2rk7q	True
1364479230.0	1b6de2	About Engetsu (SPOILERS)	Andygoesrawr	50	10	55	"So, since we saw Isshin's Shikai in the latest chapter, an old discussion has been brought up. How exactly did he use Getsuga Tensho against Aizen with his Zanpakuto (seemingly) sealed?

Well, now that we know his Shikai doesn't actually change in appearance from his normal sword, it's highly likely that we've actually seen his Shikai.

In [this](http://i4.mangapanda.com/bleach/405/bleach-2400183.jpg) page from chapter 405, his sword bears a striking resemblance to his [Shikai](http://i995.mangapanda.com/bleach/531/bleach-4007213.jpg), complete with the strings at the end of his sword being encased in the energy (it's hard to tell in the first picture, but the strings aren't visible through the energy in either). Prior to this attack by Isshin, Aizen was being beaten down by Yoruichi and Urahara, with Isshin nowhere to be seen. It's highly likely that during this time, Isshin was off to the side releasing his Shikai, and after he fired a full-powered Getsuga Tensho, he sealed his sword.

So following this, a few questions have been answered. Isshin was able to use Getsuga Tensho because his sword was in Shikai, and it's his sword's special ability which Ichigo inherited. Isshin learned (or attempted to learn) the Final Getsuga Tensho from Engetsu, because his Zanpakuto revolves around the Getsuga in the same way Ichigo's does.

And finally, Isshin's Zanpakuto is not a fire type. The energy from the Getsuga he used against Aizen looks exactly the same as the energy covering Engetsu in the latest chapter, and fire generally looks a little bit different when Kubo draws it (has more flaring and dark areas).

But it stands to reason that Isshin's Getsuga Tensho would be different to Ichigo's. The ""zan"" in Zangetsu refers to a slicing or chopping action, which describes the way his Getsuga Tensho functions. The ""en"" in Engetsu can be broken down into ""blazing"" and ""sword"", which also describes the way Isshin's Getsuga Tensho functions (from what we've seen).

TL;DR: Isshin used his Shikai against Aizen, hence why he was able to use Getsuga Tensho."	t5_2rk7q	True

She was one of the first people to actually see hollows, she was attacked at the same time as orihime, in fact has been friends with Ichigo so much longer than Orihime, yet why has his spirit power never been leaked to her like it did for chad/inoue? 

It's evident she has 'some' spirit power as she can see them in the first place... but she's never been involved in any of the fighting as Chad/Inoue have. 

I think that if ANYONE had potential more than anyone else, it was her. She is a badass who people don't mess with at all, she got second in japan for nationals (i forget what martial art [and if she eventually won at a later date]) - Why is she not part of the 'crew' which Ichigo has formed around himself? I understand the other classmates who have comical side appearances etc. but it really annoys me that she hasn't been developed as the character i'd hoped for. Does anyone else feel this way?

I have a few (although they could be incorrect, forgive my lack of sources). Some of this may be basic knowledge for you all, but I thought it was cool.

- In the anime, Kon is voiced by Kubo himself!
- Hisagi supposedly has a Bankai, it is yet to be revealed.
- The first Shinigami Ichigo ever meets besides Rukia in the anime (I'm afraid I can't remember his name) does not appear in the manga.
- Near the start of the Heuco Mundo arc, in the anime, the Shinigami trapped under the surface of Hueco Mundo who meets Rukia does not appear in the manga. However, Kubo wanted to include him in the manga but did not have time to, hence why he is in the anime.
- In the filler Zanpakuto arc (anime), the new characters were designed by Kubo himself, so although they are not canon, they can safely be thought of as precise characterisations.
- The first draft of issue 1 of the manga was vastly different, with Rukia appearing as a tiny sprite-like-fairy-thing.

1353825983.0	13r1tl	The measure of 'Speed' in the Bleach universe is nigh impossible, and is making things extremely difficult to judge in this whole tournament thing.	NobleV	49	8	55	"EDIT: been told Gin's sword is around a little less than 500x the speed of sound, not light. Which makes him a considerably weaker character. 

EDIT 2: IDEA!!!! Let's have a giant discussion thread where we post the pros and cons of each fighter left before we begin voting. That way we can get facts, myths, and all that stuff debunked before we actually place an upvote on somebody. 

The entire measurement of speed in Bleach is skewed. You've got Byakuya, who is supposed to be the fastest Shunpo in all of the current Gotei 13, who ends up outmatched by Ichigo's Bankai, which is entirely about focusing all reiatsu inwards and consolidating it into his small frame. But then, Ichigo gets outmaneuvered by almost everybody he fights afterwards. We know Yoruichi is extremely fast, as well. Everybody keeps talking about Shinji being fast but I don't think it's every been mentioned that he was particularly fast. 

And this whole ""Ishida is fast"" thing is pretty ridiculous. People actually think he's faster than Captain level shunpo and Espada Sonido. The only two people he fought were Yammy (extremely slow) and Grantz (also never moves hardly at all). When he fights a faster opponent, he gets half his body ripped off. And yet he's made it to this far in a tournament because of his speed?

And Ichimaru's bankai is supposed to be like ~~ten times the speed of light~~. If that were the case, then he shouldn't be allowed in the tournament at all because he'd beat everybody who couldn't dodge (other than Aizen, apparently). He'd just shred somebody within a second. But that's obviously not the case at all. Ichigo was blocking his attacks (though I'm sure they weren't 'full speed', but still). 

We have all these people who are being called 'fast', and they are winning for it only, but we've given no credit to the strong, and they are losing. I just really feel like the idea of 'speed' in the bleach universe needs to be re-looked at and re-examined when you guys make your choices, because it's obviously not the only factor here.

1362768633.0	19xche	[SPOILER] Theory on Ichigo's zanpakuto.	Monory	44	2	28	"This is a little bit of a conspiracy theory, but one of my personal favorite theories is that Urahara is behind everything. We know that Urahara seems to have created his own version of every technology from the Soul King's realm. What if he created his own version of asauchi and gave it to Ichigo? 

We know that in the first part of the manga Ichigo had his boring longsword after being stabbed by Rukia, and after confronting Byakuya he had that purged from within him. I think that up to that point his powers were just a manifestation of Rukia's powers. However, during training with Urahara he seems to acquire a new sword. I think it is possible that Urahara slipped in his own form of asauchi with Ichigo in his little hole while forcing him to go hollow form. The restraints that bound Ichigo's arms appear to be a type of kido, but could very well be Urahara's asauchi. [Looking at them](http://i20.mangapanda.com/bleach/61/bleach-1586680.jpg) they even resemble the criss-cross armguards Ichigo has in the more recent chapters. The encroachment process was pretty intense and would have allowed Ichigo to quickly imprint upon the asauchi. This is also the first time Ichigo ever experiences his inner world with Zangetsu, consistent with this being the first time he is in contact with an asauchi. If Urahara is in fact manufacturing his own asauchi, he may have even been able to create versions that can be imprinted upon by humans, leading to the fulbringers and people like Orihime. 

It is also unlikely that Ichigo's sword comes from his quincy side. We know that quincy powered weapons purge hollows completely, but Ichigo has been purifying hollows not purging them. This is pretty clear evidence that his sword derives from either within himself or an asauchi.

Edit: Further evidence that Urahara could have created asauchi. The two kids at Urahara's shop seem to have come from nowhere, and the girl seems very much like a robot. They could easily be his early experiments into making asauchi that he kept around, similar to all the girls with afro-dude up in the soul king's realm. On top of that, Urahara seems to have uncanny control over his own Zanpakuto, which could be explained by it being his own creation.

Second edit: It is also possible the ""chain of fate"" that ichigo sees in the hole while training is not actually his chain of fate, but the asauchi that Urahara created. Mouths are covering it, similar to the mouths of the asauchi in the soul king's realm. We never actually see those mouths present on other human souls when their chain of fate is present, even in the hospital guy who's chain is eroding. His struggle with the chain could be analogous to Renji's fighting in the soul king's realm to prove himself worthy to the asauchi. Either he proves himself worthy of the asauchi, or he dies.

http://www.mangapanda.com/94-632-17/bleach/chapter-178.html

&gt; ""The unbearable vacancy of the throne in the sky""

At the time it seemed like he was just talking about becoming a god. But later we learned that his goal involved trying to get to the soul kings palace, which we now know is located ""Above"" soul society with very limited means of getting there. Urahara and Aizen spoke about the soul king as ""It"" as well... So perhaps there is no soul king at present, just a placeholder of sorts? Which Aizen planned on destroying and replacing?

A secondary theory to build on that, what if the soul king is meant to be a being that isn't limited to being a shinigami, but is able to master the powers of all forms of the soul Avatar style; which would mean that the reason the throne is vacant is because such a versatile soul such a rare thing that nobody has risen up able to replace the old king - it can't be a promoted shinigami, because the soul king isn't a shinigami. Squad Zero didn't interfere with Aizen, because he had the potential to be such a replacement, and S0 has already established that protecting the king and the overall balance was their only concern (They'd have stopped Aizen if SS failed, after the monster he turned into, but prior to his breakdown they probably wanted to wait and see).

If it's assumed that the king became absent a thousand to two thousand years ago, then it would also explain a few minor plot holes. Right now we know that only a zanpaktou can purify a hollow soul, and hollows killed by a Quincy (and, assumably, other non zanpaktou means - Kido kills anyone?) are destroyed entirely. The whole quincy genocide happened because those destroyed souls where threatening the balance of the worlds. So how was the balance maintained before zanpaktou where invented? Why doesn't sending souls to hell, and thus out of circulation, cause problems?

The soul king is able to take destroyed souls and re-form them as purified beings. Souls wouldn't need someone to send them to soul society, because the soul king maintains the path they naturally take, with the help of powerful souls (early shinigami) working for him. That makes hollows rare and powerful monsters but on a whole easily managed, while hell isn't indefinite torture forever it's just somewhere the soul king puts particularly cruel souls to punish them before purifying them and returning them to the cycle. Then one day the soul king stops doing his job. The path for souls grows twisted and dark, and hollows become more and more common, while destroyed souls aren't being restored to the balance. Zanpaktou are invented to pick up the slack, the Quincy get wiped out because their methods of fighting have suddenly gone from fine to risking reality, and the shinigami acadamy gets set up because suddenly they need as many shinigami on the job as possible. Additionally, most of the characters don't know that far back into history - the only characters shown to be older than the Acadamy or educated enough like Yamamoto or Urahara aren't the type to go telling stories about how the world used to be - so it makes sense that most souls would believe this is just the way it's always been.

Which, if all this is true, points to Ichigo being a soul with the potential to take the soul kings place...

I don't know if much has been said on this, but bear in mind these are all just random jumbled thoughts btw.  
So you have all these names linked. The ""slaying moon"" destroy's Aizen's illusion by transcending (connecting to heaven's domain, ""heaven chain"") creating a ""moonless sky"".  Apart from obviously foreshadowing he'd take down Aizen, it is interesting that he had to go through HM as well to do so. However, there's still the ""Mirror Flower"" part of Aizen's zan, and his ability to affect Bach in the Muken, plus we've never seen his bankai, so to me that tells me there's still a big reveal on his part. That said, I think it also reflects Aizen's ""it's never what it seems"" personality. The whole looking for the kings key (And the fact it wasn't something that could be grasped in hand), combined with it NOT actually being possible for him to ""get"" in the first place. It was all a dream for him so he would have to MAKE his own for it to be reality.  
Also, consider that all of the Quincy attacks translate as ""holy"" this/that, and you have ""hueco mundo"" as being under a permanent moon, and he activates both his hollow powers and his quincy powers in his bankai. Add that to Zangetsu needing to be rebuilt, Ichigo getting Quincy powers, and their star/solar theme, and I'm seeing Ichigo finally getting new powers/a zan rename or something. Call it farfetched, but I've always been interested in the nomenclature in Bleach, and I don't think it's going to be empty and abandoned.
  Anyways, these are all random musings, there was more to it but it's all slipped my mind, something about how the fact that Engetsu was scathing is going to link in to this whole Quincygo/Bach story (See the nearby thread on his family as it has some good ideas), injuring but not slaying them... But I'll remember shortly I hope.

It seemed like the ideal existance for me as I tried to fight down these emotions and feelings I couldn't understand or control. I  idealized him and subconciouslly based my actions and interactions on his. After about six months in this downward spiral I realized flaw in this idealization. Ulquiorra was a Nihilist and believes in nothing that he can't see. At first I empathized with this; bonds of friendship couldn't be seen and my friends had all let me down. It was comfortable building this shell of no emotion and dampening my own reaction, but it was getting me nowhere. Then I had the moment where it all came crashing down on me. 

My world collapsed. I realized that why I was so miserable was because I had built this shell and cut everyone off. There were people who cared for me but I had willingly cut them out of my life in order to feel comfortable and safe. It was easier to be like Ulquiorra and be cold, unfeeling and logical instead of put my feelings out there for anyone to walk all over. But I had done it to myself. Many tears were shed when I realized how much of an ass I had been to those that cared about me.

Now that my world had collapsed and I was starting over, I felt I needed something else to emulate. Enter Ichigo. Oh. My. God. Ichigo was the perfect idol for someone struggeling with depression.  His Hollow is a perfect analogy for how it felt when I was getting depressed. I didn't feel like myself - it was like someone else was controlling my body, actions and reactions and I was watching from the background. The trick was breaking the mask before turning into a hollow. After that the hollow has to be subjugated so it doesn't keep resurfacing. 

Turns out I followed a good ichigo timeline, too. Initial surfacing of my ""hollow"", living in fear of it until it took over my life. Through intensive ""training"" I subjugated my hollow and gained control of my life again. This struggle had left me stronger emotionally and with greater awareness of what was going on both in my emotional states and with others. But it was still there in the background. ""Don't you ever forget. Either of us could become the king or the horse. If you ever give me the chance, I'll drag you down into the mud and crush your skull!"" Unlke Ichigo, I was aware that I wasn't completely in control of my hollow. Last fall I moved to a very rainy area of the state, and that fall and winter brought with it the re-emergance of my hollow. My grades plummited and I became anti-social. Luckily for me I had a very understanding room mate and the self awareness to get into counciling right away. It was short, but I had certainly been face down in the mud with a weight on my skull. Now I feel like I have Hollow Mask 2.0. It's a shaky control, and there will have to be some violent and long-lasting battle before I am completely at peace once again. I will never reach Mugetsu and be one with it, though. I've accepted that I will have to live with this my entire life.

Interestingly enough, what got me through durring the winter was Zangetsu's advice to Ichigo: "" Why do you run Ichigo? You still have not called me. Face forward, Ichigo. You should be able to hear it now. That whichs blocks your ears is worthless fear. The enemy is one, you are one. What is there to fear? Cast off your fear. Look forward! Go forward! Never stand still. Retreat and you will age. Hesitate and you will die!"" I listened to that walking to class. I had it on my alarm notification to get up. ""FACE FORWARD"".  Now that I'm out of my depression, I still have this mantra. But today I noticed something interesting. I put my tablet down to answer a phone call. I absently pushed the power button to wake it up and the camera turned on for my Face Recognition screen lock. I looked at it and it was an interesting view of the leafless tree I was walking by. By continually ""Facing Forward"" I had been blind to the things around me. Maybe it's  time to loosen up on these words I've been living by and open myself up to other directions besides Forward. No offense to Zangetsu. It was great advice and got me through a tough time. 

I feel like this whole analogy isn't too far off the mark, since it's aimed at teenage males. Overcome your own internal ""hollows"" and you can go far, but let them dominate you and you will fall. Or maybe I'm reading way too much into it. 

Sorry for the wall of text, this isn't meant to be a pity post. I just wanted to share what I've gotten from Bleach and why it's  semi-spiritual to me, and unfortunately I don't see a way to do that without sharing it.

So, /r/bleach, subjugate your hollows, permanent or temporary, and live life to the fullest (age to the fullest, go bald to the fullest)! Retreat and you will age! Hesitate and you will die!

**Edit:** As I said in a post down below - here is not the place to vent or talk about troubles in your life unless one of those troubles happens to be a Hollow, in which case please find the closest Shinigami or Shinigami representative and get off of Reddit. 

That being said, my door is always open.

1350321064.0	11ipcz	Kira's Shikai		44	8	30	"Hi!

When my friends and I used to hold hour-long conversations about Bleach, power and skill comparisons were an unavoidable topic. In the countless discussions we had concerning relative strengths and power, I always held Kira's abilities in very, very high regard.

He obviously isn't one of the most widely recognized characters in Bleach, nor does he hold much respect in the manga itself. But, in terms of his shikai, does anyone else feel that Kira deserves the status of ""absolutely-not-to-be-fucked-with-unless-your-ability-happens-to-involve-disintegrating-into-a-million-pieces""?

Of course, Kubo didn't write him in as a powerful character. But I can't help but wonder what the manga would be like if Kira, as a person, had the spirit pressure/skill potential of Hitsugaya, Yama, Ichigo, Kenpachi, etc. The ability to double the weight of anything you slice? Are you shitting me? And it stacks infinitely? If his speed and strength were up to par with the main characters, I seriously couldn't conceive of anyone successfully fucking with him, including those shinigami with swords that dissolve (he would just need to be able to power through/outsmart them).

IMO, Kira's shikai could've been an amazing tool for a powerful villain, central protagonist, or mysterious badass everyone avoids making eye contact with.

EDIT: I'd go so far as to say that if Kira were anywhere near someone's power level, but not quite there, he'd still have complete advantage, esp. in a world such as Bleach where people land hits all day long. Also, I forgot he got decimated by a Quincy. I'm kind of sad now. Again, though, his sword didn't even come into play. He's just too weak."	t5_2rk7q	True

Also he's left it a mystery for a reason.  If he really had lost them then when he regained his powers he would have mentioned something explaining fullbring eliminates it or he couldn't recover them after he lost his powers anything.

So I'm convinced his hollow powers will comeback soon maybe even next chapter based on the last page.

I was contemplating a possible theory as to how Isshin could viably have a family with Masaki. What could have the potential to outcast Isshin from the Gotei 13, but tie in with the other characters? It can't be a mere coincidence that Isshin and Urahara are so very familiar with each other.

Then something came to me. What if Urahara found a way that could allow for a Shinigami hybrid, much as to what Aizen's intent was, to a degree? What if Urahara was able to find a way to allow Isshin to have a family with Masaki, thereby providing the potential for a Shinigami-Quincy hybrid.

Urahara providing a Shinigami, a captain no less, the means to have a family with a Quincy would certainly provide a strong enough catalyst to reason why they were exiled. It could also provide some credibility to the theory that Masaki's death wasn't an accident or even the attempt on Ichigo's life as a child.

1371716460.0	1gpsq8	NSFW Pretty far fetched theory. Don't read if not caught up to manga.	AMagicRake	38	5	41	"So I was thinking on the way to work this morning that it looks like the short sword is OMZ and the right sword is Hichigo. I thought this was pretty obvious from the bottom of [this panel](http://mangastream.com/read/bleach/91292762/14).

Then I started to think about how most of OMZ powers have been to protect Ichigo from harm. So I started to think like this:

* Hichigo is his power his sword, OMZ always said it was his power that helped him defeat his foes.
* And OMZ is his shield, prtecting him, stopping his bleeding, his Blut Vein when Ywach stabbed him

So this is where my theory gets far fetched. What if, and i stress the if, his Bankai becomes a sword and shield combo? His Short sword becomes a Shield and his Big Sword Becomes like Tensa Zangetsu again? I think that would be pretty cool, and probably give him a big fighting advantage against most.

Well thats what I think anyway, What do you guys think?"	t5_2rk7q	True
1369904253.0	1fbrqt	Sajin Komamura is the greatest swordsman	mr-nobe	55	20	34	"I have deduced that Sajin Komamura is the greatest swordsman ever after three very compelling pieces of evidence. 

One)  although set in China the movie Hero introduced the concept of the three stages of swordplay, the last being the swordsman and the sword becoming one. Mayuri stated Sajin was the only shinigami close enough to his zanpakuto to  repair it when his bankai is damaged. This represents his oneness with his sword. 

Two) sajin's bankai represents the second stage in which the swordsman becomes so skilled he can use a blade of grass. Now if I recall correctly sajin's Bandai summons a giant demon samurai that he controls with his katana. I feel this is an interpretation of the stage

Three) sajin's is one chill fucker that looks like he could be the best.

Then in one of the more recent chapters Isshin talks about how Hitsugaya will be the next captain and Rangiku says that she is the Lieutenant and she should be the next captain. Then as I wwas watching Gin reminisce about Rangiku and him and how Aizen took some of soul. I thought maybe that part of her soul was the part that would help mold her Zan to have bankai and the reason she wasn't able to become a captain or even have a bankai is because Aizen took a part of her soul.

Happy today! Whatever today is to you. Could be your birthday. Happy birthday, person whose birthday it is. I hope you don't get shitty cake.

NOW! Onto the results.

Well, I was wrong. The results counted out to be:

Gin - 146

Byakuya - 103

So, while I thought Byakuya would win, Gin has won. That's not completely bad though!

Which means it will be Gin v Starrk in the finals! Which will be on Tuesday. 

Some of you called this from the beginning, well done. But while I have your attention: Which would you rather see next: a team tournament (teams of 2 or 3, haven't decided yet), a low-tier tournament (Vice captains/Fraccion), or an OP tournament (Aizen, Urahara, Ichigo)? Personally, I kinda wanna see the team tournament. But the low tier tournament sounds awesome too. Because Hisagi.

Hightech_Lowlife	47	10	29	"Everyone that's read [this](http://manga-access.com/manga/B/Bleach/chapter/397/18) should have already known that Ichigo's mom was special. There would have been absolutely no need for Isshin to interrupt Aizen otherwise. 

Even before this current arc began, people had been theorizing that Isshin was a member of the noble Shiba clan, but disgraced himself and his entire house by turning against Soul Society and choosing to protect innocent Quincies, explaining his relationship with Ryuuken. Don't forget that Soul Society once advocated Genocide to solve the Quincy problem. I for one definitely see Captain Isshin having a problem with orders like that.

A high ranking member(possibly head) of a noble house fighting against Soul Society in defense of Quincies  is exactly the kind of disgrace that would provoke old authoritarian Byakuya to [this](http://manga-access.com/manga/B/Bleach/chapter/116/34)

1342073278.0	wfgy1	[THEORY] Ichigo and the Hollow Mask	FLAjakub	45	10	18	So many of us are wondering if Ichigo still has the ability to go hollow after Aizen's defeat and the subsequent loss of his spiritual power. My theory is that he can no longer create his hollow mask. Going back to the Lost Agent arc, we are told that Fullbring powers are the result of residual Hollow reiatsu. The Xcution members got their hollow reiatsu while they were still in their mother's womb and attacked by hollows. Ichigo, however, has residual reiatsu from another source. After fighting Tensa Zangetsu and learning the secrets of the Final Getsugatensho, at that point we can assume his shinigami and hollow powers became one. After using this attack he lost all of his shinigami powers, but because they were merged with his hollow powers, he lost those as well. So the source of his fullbring was the residual hollow reiatsu after using Mugetsu. After losing his fullbring to Ginjo, any residual fullbring power was his original hollow power. Therefore, his altered look after gaining back his shinigami powers is pretty much his new hollow mask.	t5_2rk7q	True

1376534431.0	1ke7fp	Theory in Aizen's favor. Wall of text.	DreDayDrizzy	42	9	18	"First I want to say that I always believed the reason Aizen lost was because his will was to meet someone as strong as him, and after Ichigo surpassed him the hogyoku abandoned Aizen.

But my theory is Aizen still has the hogyoku within him it never left and it still chooses him as the master. Why? Because once Aizen met Ichigo after dangai training Aizen was curious as why he couldn't feel Ichigos spiritual pressure. Aizen then concluded that Ichigo had another ""dimension"" of power where shinigami, hollow, Quincy, full bringer are one dimensional, Aizen who had transcended was 2 dimensional but Ichigo was 3 dimensional. That was my understanding.
This is where my theory begins, Aizens will changed to reach a 3rd dimension of power and thus hogyoku grants Aizens his will after he's struck with mugetsu. Aizen witnessed Ichigos full 3rd dimensional power (which I believe was fusing with zanpakuto) and the hogyoku began reconstructing Aizen.

One of the first things to happen after Aizen recovers from mugetsu is his zanpakuto begins to disappear, yet he admits Ichigo and himself evolved with their zanpakutos becoming one with sword but Ichigo progressed further than Aizen becoming zangetsu itself.

So Aizens zanpakuto was not deteriorating but fusing with him to achieve something similar to Ichigos FGT without losing his power afterwards. And thus the hogyoku begins reverting Aizen to its former self in order to reconstruct becoming a newer improved transcendent being.

Aizen mentions himself when fighting with gin you can't evolve without fear, and he did evolve after gin stabbed him and again after Ichigo beat the shit out of him, same goes for Ichigo he was scared he would lose the whole time until training in dangai. So after mugetsu Aizen begins evolving again.

Now flashback to Aizen vs Urahara, Isshin, Yoruichi fight and Aizen admits during his cocoon stage he is most vulnerable but he still had his overwhelming power to cancel all attacks. So after mugetsu the hogyoku reverts Aizen to rebuild and goes into another cocoon stage but him being weaker Uraharas kido takes effect sealing him. But who is to say Aizen stopped evolving? It was clear Aizens zanpakuto is disappearing yet he didn't die so it has to still exist! And he still had the appearances of a hollow in his eyes and partial mask on jaw so we can assume he still has hollow power.

I think his time in solitary confinement is essential for evolving into a stronger transcendent being becoming one with zanpakuto (this is basically his dangai training)  Aizen has been able to train for 17 months compared to Ichigos 3 months. Keep in mind when Ichigo was training he just sat still.

Aizens progression is apparent when Juha Bach invites Aizen to join but declines and later Haschwald says Aizen altered the time how long they have been in soul society. I had another theory before where Aizen met Bach before and used his zanpakuto on him. Similar to Aizens encounter with Barragan which is how he could alter Bachs time. Yet he was completely bound to the chair! No sword in sight.
So I think he finished evolving into one with his zanpakuto and still has his hollow power and he will soon break free to fight in the final days.

The rest of my theory really only can happen if the Soul King is a bad guy. Which is an idea in not to fond of but...

After Ichigo beats up every Quincy and somehow squad 0 is gone Ichigo fights Uryu and he is told what the soul king does and blah blah he's evil. Ichigo and Uryu team up to defeat Soul King but Urahara shows up to stop them, then Aizen shows up to get his rematch with Urahara while Ichigo and Uryu proceed to fight Soul King.

TL;DR Aizen evolved into another transcendent being similar to FGT without loosing his powers and will have a rematch with Urahara."	t5_2rk7q	True

1368246047.0	1e42zn	Is it possible that a Zanpakuto actually limits a Shinigami's power?	aversion25	38	5	76	"Before I start discussing my tinfoil theory, I'd like to throw out that it's only borderline thought through and hopefully will foster some discussion (aka someone else connects the dots!) If not, hey - we have some conversation mid week when this place is dead ;)

You join the Gotei 13 and are given a Zanpakuto. It never leaves your side, and eventually you imprint your soul on the sword. At some point the Asauchi calls out your name in a form that fits your personality. It was stated that Asauchi are the most powerful when they are blank. They also look like Gigai's when they're blank. You now have a sword that can transform.

You train more, and the special few learn bankai which is a full release physical manifestation of your sword. This is a Shinigami at his max power, and he can literally lose power if he's injured in this state.

So my entire theory is predicated on a somewhat weak, but warranted question/assumption: Why did Ichigo become so powerful when he merged with his sword? How was he able to stop Aizen? It could be a) plotkai b) Ichigo is a clusterfuck of everything, aka the one OR c) merging with his sword put his soul back together

What if the sword fragments your soul, thus creating that ""upper limit"" Aizen talked about that is inherent in every Shinigami? It would be genius in creation in terms of controlling the Soul Reapers. 

Look at the espada. Breaking the boundary between hollows/shinigami gave them great power by giving them intellect/strength. Their swords limited their power - a release brought them back to their original state. So once again, the swords were used as a form of control. I swore in the anime one of the fallen espada (fodder that the team fought when they initially entered HM) claimed that an arrancar could never return to some form if they did something in their released state? (the girl uryu fought). This sounds similar to breaking in bankai mode.

Most hollows lost the ability to regenerate when they became arrancars. However, zanpaktuo can regenerate themselves. It could be a shift of the soul's powers? 

This theory is fucking nuts I admit. It's like a worst case scenario assuming everyone in Squad 0/SK is evil. But I don't understand how come all these great thinkers and creators made these inventions that don't seem to allowed in the Gotei. 

Squad 4 heals with kido, not hot springs. Transferring powers is a crime, but they can literally transfer reiatsu with food. No one else is allowed to create a zanpaktau, and the other method of fighting (using Quincy techniques) is outlawed and the clan was destroyed. Why did the creator of the sword keep saying you got your basis wrong for the zanpaktau? How come only Shinigami could master an Asauchi? 

What do you guys think! any other conspiracy tidbits we can add?

First off, when Ichigo first fights his inner hollow, it attacks him by grabbing him by the face and slamming him into the ground - when Ichigo fights aizen later, after accepting his hollow half as part of himself, he pulls the same move on aizen. Could be coincidence, or maybe Kubo dropping a subtle hint about whats changed with Ichigo?

The other thing I just remembered is that when Ichigo fought the grand fisher, his mums spirit was able to gain enough free will to talk to him and encourage him. Both Rukia, the other shinigami that had shown up, and the grand fisher himself had nothing more than guesses about why that happened, because it took them all by surprise. Now we find out Masaki was actually a Quincy... So again, coincidence, or has Kubo been planning Ichigo's Quincy bloodline for a lot longer than we think?

1363345863.0	1acels	Bleach ### [My Theories and Speculation from the Past to Present events, it's VERY LONG, be warned.]	masterx25	41	5	25	"PART I:  



This theory is what I've gathered about the main characters, Quincy and Vandenreich and my opinion on what's happening and going to happen from spending the whole day thinking while at work to reading other’s theory and trying to figure out which one makes most sense.   
NOTE: Bach = Yhwach, I don’t know why Bleach wiki calls him by that but I chose to use it.  

First we have to go the beginning, 1000 years ago to when Yamato fought Yhwach. At this point of time, Gotei 13 was formed at an unknown point of time, likely only consisted of 13 members even though Shin'o Academy has existed for 2100 years training Souls, because when Yhwach was talking about the first Gotei 13, it showed only 13 individuals.  
The original Gotei 13 acted as ""ruthless killers"" guardians of Soul Society, mentioned by Yhwach who says it was when Gote 13 was at its' peak power. The only two official identified members of Gotei 13 at that time are Yamato and Unohana. Though judging from the conversation between Yamato and Yhwach, Yamato at that time only revealed his Shikai in their fight, and with this knowledge, we can assume Zero Division member Oetsu Nimaiya was also in Gotei 13 at that time, since he is the creator of the Asauchi and in the process created the Zanpakuto. Oetsu has stated all Shinigami Zanpakuto originates from him, as he created every Asauchi for each Shinigami, and for any Shinigami to unlock Shikai and Bankai, they must train with a Zanpakuto containing a Asauchi, therefore it's heavily implied he was part of the original 13 members Gotei 13.  
Since there were only 13 members, I doubted they could actively defend Soul Society and Living World from Hollow attacks, and send Souls to Soul Society.  
This can explain why the original Gotei 13 were ruthless killers, as they constantly spent their time killing Hollows without mercy, as they weren't sending souls to Soul Society, people that die in the Living World were all becoming Hollows in mass numbers, than being cleansed when once killed.  

We know that Yhwach is over 1000 years old, we do not know whether he's a human or not, but we do know his current status is a Quincy. We can't confirm that he was a Quincy at the time of 1000 years ago, but we will assume that for now.   
What happened in the fight between Yamato and Yhwach?   
My theory is that 1000 years ago, the Quincy were major group with powers rivalling those of the Gotei 13, lead by Yhwach himself. For some reason, the Quincy decided to pick a fight with Gotei 13, for what reason we aren’t told.  
I believe that the Quincy of that time were angry at the Gotei 13 for not using their power to defend the living world from Hollows, taking that task onto themselves to actively stop attacks. As time goes by, they grew resentful of Gotei 13, and decided to attack them so they can take the responsibility of defending Souls all together (Soul Society and Living World), something that the Gotei 13 wasn't doing as 13 members weren't enough to defend Soul Society and the Living World from Hollows and sending Souls to Soul Society.  
I think what happened after the Yhwachs' defeat was that Yamato realised Gotei 13 cannot contain only 13 members, as their fight with the Quincy must have reduced their numbers, and the Quincy must have had a sizable army.  
Yamato realised that they cannot just defend Soul Society with 13 members, so he reorganised the Gotei 13 to have each individual become Captains and each have their own division consisting of several hundred Shinigami graduates from Shin'o Academy in each division, with the Captain as their leader.   
Now they have an army, numbers to actively defend Soul Society, defending humans in the living world from Hollow attacks, and sending souls from the Living World to Soul Society, becoming what they are now, proper guardians of Soul Society and the Living World.  
Over time, as Hollow attack becomes less frequent, the now-Captains has become less ruthless as they spend less time fighting, and more time maintaining peace in Soul Society.   

Now with this gets interesting. Since there are now Shinigami actively defending Soul Society and Living World, and less souls becoming Hollows, the Hollows are afraid.  
They chose to spend their existing time in Hueco Mundo, with most Hollows devouring each other to satisfy their hunger. This results in the birth of Gillian-class Menos, far stronger than ordinary Hollows.   
Even with the new found powers, the Gillians still won't dare to freely walk the Living World, as Captain, Vice-Captains, and Royal Guards are still easily capable of defeating a Gillian-class Menos.   
The Gillians continue their devouring of fellow Hollows as they now realise they can become more powerful with more Hollow they consume, thus also giving birth to the Adjuchas-class and then the Vasto Lorde-class Menos.   
The Menos that reach Adjuchas-class become more intellectual, and eventually created their own rules for living in Hueco Mundo.   
The Hollows that roam the Living World either cannot control their hunger for souls, or is simply afraid of staying in Hueco Mundo, feared of being killed by another Hollow and their thirst for power.   

Now to approximately 200 years ago just before the Quincy Purge. Since the defeat of Quincy 800 years prior to this point, the Quincy has changed a lot. They concentrate their time, spending it on defending themselves from Hollows, who has found a food that has high Reiryoku, but not as powerful as Shinigami, therefore they take the risk to actively attack them. Because of the more frequent attacks against them and those around them, the Quincy spread the teaching of Quincy techniques and at the same time become more hostile towards the Hollow, no longer treating them as fallen souls, but more like criminals that does not deserve to be sent to Soul Society by Shinigami.
