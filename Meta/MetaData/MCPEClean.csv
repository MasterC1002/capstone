Happy holiday season. I hope everyone is just fine and dandy. (If you could just take a sec to upvote this so it'll be read, that'd be great [I don't get karma, sillies. :D] Awesome, thank you.)

You guys don't see me around here much, because this is pretty much self-running. Ya'll have been really great most of the time. However, today I'm here to talk about some things. Unrelated posts, bad reporting and removal, and how you guys can help.

**The first major problem we're having are unrelated posts.** Some of you may forget that even though this is an awesome, very close community, it's still a community for MCPE related posts. Sorry guys, this may not be what you want to hear, but it needs to be said. No more IRL photos, iPhone backgrounds, or anything of the sort. You can feel free to share your creations of that sort in [the regular minecraft subreddit](/r/minecraft) or through personal PMs. Yes, they are fun, and yes, it's fun to have user related posts, but this subreddit simply isn't for it. And I feel some of you may have forgotten that.

**The second thing I'd like to talk about is some problems with removal, downvoting, and reporting.** All I ask of you guys is to please follow the reddiquitte when it comes to downvotes. This relates to everything else. **Do** downvote things that don't relate to MCPE (IRL pictures, iphone backgrounds not pertaining to MCPE, stuff that doesn't contribute). **Don't** downvote posts you don't agree with, but that do follow the posting guide. Things like calls to action like this one, or helpful guides on farms that *you* may have seen. Don't write things off as a repost, because we're getting new people every day. They may not have seen it. Guys, a background picture of chickens shouldn't be on the front page, however cool it is.

**The last thing is what you can do about it.** Basically, the report button is your friend. Spammy post? Report. Post not related to MCPE? Report. Report, report, report. Often we miss it. Also, feel free to message us, the mods, at any time. Often we can do something about it.

So yup, that's pretty much it from me. Disagree? Agree? Comments? Tell me in a comment or a PM. Feel free to tag me with RES as ""Evil mod"" or ""does crappy job with MCPE"" or whatever you feel you want to call me if you disagree with this. Especially now that Jeb will be looking at this subreddit sometimes, we need a cleanup. I'm just trying to get this subreddit back to what it's all about: **Minecraft: Pocket Edition.**

See ya'll later.

-EitanWolf

**TLDR: Post MCPE related things only, follow reddiquitte more with up/downvotes, and use that report button.**"	t5_2tu23	True

Whatever Bubbles is telling is slightly over-exaggerated. The blade was nowhere near my spine. The blade was maybe 2-3 inches in when I did it. The reason the doctors didn't let her see me is because she was hysterical. They told her to go home and just relax. Banana, Ass, Eitan I'm sorry for how crazy this got. It was not meant to go this far as to have subreddit chaos. b00o Im kinda hurt you though I was lying. Bubbles please clam down if you this. I'm fine and will be returning to school tomorrow.

1361396630.0	18wt8w	Yes, you can edit iOS MCPE files without Jailbreaking	SoySauceSyringe	73	6	34	"So I've posted this in reply to a few comments recently, but it seems like there are a lot of people who aren't aware that you don't need to jailbreak your iDevice to mess with MCPE.  I've confirmed this on my non-jailbroken iPhone 5 running iOS 6.1 and MCPE 0.6.1, but it should work for any iDevice and any version of iOS and MCPE.

1. Get iExplorer from here: http://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/
2. Get MCPEedit from here: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1205921-pocket-edition-inventory-editor-for-desktop-computers-macwin/
2b. Update Java.  You can maybe skip this if you're up-to-date and/or just lazy, but if MCPEedit.jar won't open then install the latest version of JRE from here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1880261.html
3. Connect your device to your computer via USB and open up iExplorer.  Look in Apps/MinecraftPE/Documents/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds and you should see a folder for each world you have.  Copy these folders to your computer (make a MCPE Backup folder on your desktop or something - leave these files alone in case you mess something up and need to restore a backup, maybe even zip and datestamp them).  Then copy them again to another folder (MCPE Temp or somesuch).
4. Open MCPEedit.  Go to the file menu and you'll see you can open level, chunk and entity .DAT files for whatever world you want (from MCPE Temp, leave your backups alone!).  Entity files are pretty useless as you can't do a whole lot with them and they don't give you a lot of info, though if you want you can adjust your health or location.  Chunk files are only really worth opening if you want to generate a map of your world or move the player location (or mess with it with MCedit or WorldPainter or whatever, but I won't be covering that).  The level file has the good stuff - open that up and you can mess with your inventory, time of day, game mode, and view the seed that generated your world.  I'm guessing 90% of what people will want to do is switch between survival and creative mode and edit their inventories.
5. Edit the file to your heart's content, and then use the File menu to save it.  This will generate a new .DAT file, most likely in the same folder as MCPEedit.jar, though that can be changed.  Use iExplorer to replace the old file on your device with the new one you edited with MCPEedit.

A couple of notes: the inventory editor cannot add items, it can only change them.  I'd recommend emptying your inventory and picking up a few full stacks of cobblestone, sticks, or something else easily obtainable.  Make sure these are in the first few slots of your inventory (no blank spots before them).  Also, the amount and damage numbers don't seem to make any sense, so I leave them alone and just change the block/item type.  MCPEedit also doesn't support some recent items - for instance, it can't figure out what melons are, and you can't turn your items into Glowstone blocks, only Glowstone Dust (so just get dust and assemble the stones in-game).  You can also give yourself stacks of tools, which conserves inventory space nicely (though if you un-stack them you can't re-stack them).  Also, I always quit to title, hit the home key and quit MCPE when editing files, but I'm not sure if that's all necessary.  I would at least quit to title, though, so the world isn't loaded when you're trying to replace the files.

Also note that you can't actually mess with the .app package via iExplorer, which means you can't install texture packs.  I think this is a result of system protections implemented in iOS 6 - if someone can figure out a way to get around this or try it on iOS 5, I'd be interested to know.

Anyway.  Hope this is at least news to someone, I'm going to feel pretty dumb if you all knew this already!  And if you have any trouble, comment here and I'll do my best to help."	t5_2tu23	True

* **Mob Grinders** - There are many different versions of mob grinders. [Here's a great video tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kclXjsNDzeY) for a very effective model using a body of water to direct the mobs to a drop hole in the middle of the mob spawning room. (very low light levels are key for spawning hostile mobs.) [Here's](http://imgur.com/a/mEvd2) an album of my version of this method.

* **Sugarcane farming** - [Sugarcane]( http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Sugar_Cane) can be planted on [sand, dirt and grassblocks]( http://i.imgur.com/C4VuLgF.png) that are directly adjacent to water. It will grow over time (up to 3 blocks from the water source) and can be farmed efficiently by breaking the upper portion of the plant, avoiding the need to replant the sugar cane. Once placed, you can remove the water next to the sugarcane. When the sugarcane is supposed to grow, it will instead break apart, allowing [(semi-) automated sugarcane farms.]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xWpt8do238).

* **Mushroom farming** - Mushrooms can grow on almost [every block]( http://i.imgur.com/Z59IgxU.png), but only on [light level]( http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Light) 12 and below. Mushroom can be used to craft mushroom stew. Yum.

* **Nether Reactor** - Because of some stability issues, it’s not possible to implement [The Nether](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/The_Nether) in MinecraftPE. As a replacement, [JBernhardsson](https://twitter.com/jbernhardsson) came up with The Nether Reactor. [Here’s a video on how to build it, what it does, and what you get from it.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO3nG4tJnS4) Prior to 0.6.0, The Nether Spire was made of obsidian. After this update the obsidian was replaced with netherack.

* **Shearing sheep and regrowing wool** - Shearing a sheep will produce 1-3 wool blocks. Hold down on the sheep while you have the shears on your main inventory highlighted to shave the wool. After shearing, the sheep will lose his wool and become naked. Sheep will regrow their wool by eating grass: the grassblock will turn into a dirt block. [Here is a random video showing how it works.]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOovCpBbuz0) You can also use different color dyes to permanently dye the sheep that color, giving you wool of that color.


* **How to back up your worlds iOS/Android** -

**Android** - Get the app ‘PocketInvEditor’, When you open the app it will have you choose your map, Once you choose your map there is a button that reads ‘Create Backup’ this will store a backup copy on your SD card.

**iOS** - Get iExplorer on your computer, and connect your device to it. You can access your app files by going to Documents&gt;Games&gt;com.mojang&gt;minecraftWorlds. From there, find the folder with the name of your desired world, and drag it into a folder from your library, to your desktop, creating a backup folder. Then, if you wish to send it to someone via email or through a file-sharing site, compress (zip) the folder and upload it to a file sharing website such as www.dropbox.com.

* **How to get or create a custom skin** - http://www.minecraftskins.com/ is a great place to find a new skin or create your own. 

* **Installing mods/skins/maps/texture packs** - 

**Android** – Download the app ‘UTK’ (UltimateToolKit) and download the desired mods/skins/maps/texture packs that you would like. Get out of UTK and open the app ‘PocketTool’ and follow the step by step instructions to install the downloads you have on your device. (if you are still having problems try watching [this tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2grWwpKUZqQ) that I found online.

**iOS** - At this time installing these may require a [Jailbreak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking). Please make sure you fully understand what a Jailbreak is before you do it. After you have Jailbroken your iDevice, follow these steps:

1) Backup your worlds using Ifile. [Video tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vgzdA1PNeE) 

2) Decrypt MCPE. [Video tutorial]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj0tg9Zlris) 

3) Get MCPE patch. [Add this source in cydia](http://cydia.myrepospace.com/siris/) 

4) Copy-paste the link for the mod you want from [here.](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1394066-ios-mods/) 

5) Add mod to MCPE patch, hit patch. 

6) Open MCPE and BOOM! You have your mod! 


**Check out [this thread](http://redd.it/18wt8w) from /u/SoySauceSyringe on what you can edit without Jailbreaking your iDevice.** (This method requires iExplorer and MCPEedit on a computer.)

* **Branch mining** - If you’re in need of some diamonds, Branch Mining in y=11 is your best bet. But since MCPE doesn’t have the [debug](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Debug_screen) screen, I recommend you to dig straight down until you find the first layer of bedrock, make a little base with chests and furnaces, and start mining 2x1 holes horizontally, [Like this.](http://i.imgur.com/L6UUzAM.png) 

* **Animal/Mob regeneration/degeneration**- I put [this guy](http://www.imgur.com/TR9l2q6.png) in here and walked away..I counted right about 100 blocks and came back to [this.](http://www.imgur.com/xjpXrk3.png) So, hostile mobs degenerate when you get around 100 blocks away from them. Animals will not despawn. The only way to get animals to respawn in your world without unlocks would be to kill the existing animals. If your animals are in the water, your best option is to kill them so that they will respawn elsewhere. (this option is a lot easier than trying to push them out of the water yourself.)

* **How to create an album or upload photos on imgur** - 

**Android**: Download the app called [Imgur for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mitchbarry.imgur&amp;hl=nl) from the Play Store. Some users are able to create albums using your mobile browser, Try this method and if it does not work for you, refer to the **Albums** section below.

**iOS**: iOS doesn’t have an app which is capable of making albums at this time. [ImgurApp](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imgurapp/id501416446?mt=8) will allow you to upload single pictures. Some users are able to create albums using your mobile browser, Try this method and if it does not work for you, refer to the **Albums** section below.


**Albums:** If you want to upload an album, the best option at this time is to either e-mail yourself the pictures or connect your device to your computer and transfer the pictures that you would like to use and create an album on your computer from www.imgur.com.




*(If you see a frequently asked question that should be included in this thread, try to type step by step pictures/instructions when available for people like myself that are more 'visual learners'. Try to be as thorough as possible and keep in mind that the person you are trying to explain it to may have little to no experience. If your question and answer are fitting I will add it to this post.)*

r/MCPEquestions (This is the only one we actually need, kind of.)

r/MinecraftPE

r/MCPEvideos

r/MCPEbuildings

r/MinecraftPocketEdition

r/MCPEseeds, or r/PEseeds

r/MCPEservers (This is the second one we need. r/MCPE can't have people spamming servers here, but like r/Minecraft people will probably post ""looking for a good server"" or such. *sigh*)

**EDIT**: Maybe some of those subreddits don't exist. They are examples. Thanks to /u/matchesmalone10 for pointing that out.

JUST POST IT HERE. We only have about 2800 subscribers. If you post something here, we'll answer it, don't make a subreddit *for* it. We're one subreddit, not a group of even smaller subreddits that get less than one post a day. People are actually active in this subreddit.

**EDIT 2:** Seriously, no offense but if you post something in a subreddit with less than a post a day nobody's really going to answer it. Post it in a subreddit with nearly three thousand people inhabiting it, and it will surely get answered, because, quoting from r/Minecraft ""Thanks for being cool and hanging out in 'new!"" encourages people to look at new questions and buildings people have. Oh, and if a mod of this subreddit sees this, we should have something in the 'new' section like that. Also, thanks for the new up/downvote flairs.

**EDIT 3:** Thanks for front page! I hope more people see this so we can get them to come here for help instead."	t5_2tu23	True

""As of 0.6.0 the sky in Pocket Edition only has clouds and is a lush blue color. The sun, moon, and stars will be added in later updates.""

**Yay!**

""Online (LAN) mode only allows 5 players to be on a single server.""

**Woah. Didn't know that.**

The world size is 256x256 blocks.

**Nice little tidbid for newcomers.**

The Nether is not present, but it is replaced by the Nether Reactor. The Reactor is planned to eventually be replaced.

**This could mean we'll get an *actually* Nether.**

*Helpful tips for newcomers.*

* Make sure your battery is charged, and/or plugged in (3D gaming drains the battery quickly).

* Get used to the controls before playing on servers (it is easy to mine the block under a torch by mistake).

* Tap and hold an item in the hotbar to drop it.

* Know the difference between Hostile and non-hostile mobs.

* Know how to craft and cook

The terrain.png file in the APK file found on Android devices is nearly identical to that in the PC version, containing textures for items unimplemented in the Pocket Edition (e.g., cauldron, End Portal).

**WOAH! The definitely gives some hints to some awesome stuff to be added in the future. (Lucky Android users!)**

If you have any kind of modifier or command to give yourself any item in the Minecraft entity folder (e.g. iron door) the background of the non-existing entity will appear red meaning it does not exist or was never meant to.

**That makes sense now.**

^This ^is ^an ^prediction ^by ^me, ^not ^a ^fact!

**The Indev wall (the invisible bedrock at the edges of worlds) is INFINITE! Meaning if you go up there and keeping walking, you'll never stop. (Although you'll lose the location of your world.) This gives true potential for infinite worlds. To try this, go to the edge of a world (creative preferably) and change to 3rd person. Keeping flying up until you turn invisible, then go in the direction *away* from the world! It's infinite!** *Whew...*

Baby animals are in Pocket Edition, but spawn naturally; animals cannot be actually bred yet.

**Yet... ;)**

Skeletons are significantly less accurate in Pocket Edition than PC or Xbox, making them easier to fight.

**This BETTER not be fixed. For those who haven't played the PC version, this is a GOOD thing! It's almost impossible to kill skeletons with a sword in the PC because of how accurate and strong they are!**

In PE Lite, the fact that crafting, smelting and eating is impossible gives several positive features.

Tools last forever.

You have indefinite amounts of anything excluding raw materials.

**So?**

[Here is a link to Upcoming features.](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Pocket_Edition_upcoming_features)

**Enderman**: Johan mentioned in the Live Stream Minecraft MCO Beta that Enderman will be added soon.

**Enchanting**: Johan said in the Live Stream Minecraft MCO Beta ""I think we will get that in the future"", it is planned but he isn't sure if he can implement Enchanting.

**Breeding**: Johan answered a question that Breeding will be added in a no-distant future (possibly this year)

**Redstone**: At the Minecraft Pocket Edition panel at MineCon 2012, it was stated that future plans include implementing redstone.

**Foods**: Johan mentioned on the Live Stream ""Minecraft Pocket Edition MCO Beta"" that in a future it will be added more foods. For 0.6.2 the Cake recipe will be added

**Sky Additions**: Jbernhardsson tweeted that the changes to the sky in 0.6.0 were only the first iteration, and he has plans to implement more features like sunrise/sunset and stars (to bring it closer to the PC version).

**Caves**: Jeb stated that caves may be available as an option the user can toggle in later updates.

**Skins**: Jbernhardsson tweeted, in response to a question, that customizable skins may be available in the distant future.

**In-Game music**: Johan (Livestream) answered in a question that In-Game Music will be added for the next 4-5 updates more.

These are all the things I found interesting. Don't tell me ""oh I could've just gone to the wiki and checked this out myself."" No. Shut up. This shows off some cool facts and helpful tips. Thanks for reading.

We had our infinite bricks, infinite glass and free unbreaking shears. The only mob we had were zombies and nothing else. This subreddit was small and at that time the subreddit was flooded with ""Ready for the Update"" posts which were pictures of basements full of iron ore. We had no ""b00o is crazy for chickens."" MCPE Master Builder wasn't even a mod yet. Then came 0.3.2 which added furnaces and all tools of iron, gold and diamond. It was a giant step in survival but it was hard to notice that this was only a minor update. 0.3.3 was next which added skellies and spiders. Trees now dropped saplings which was very useful as much of our world was mountains and flatlands with no trees because we chopped most of it down. Mob grinders were starting to be built because of skellies and spiders dropping string, bones and arrows. I hated getting zombies because they didn't drop any feathers yet. 0.4.0 came and was a HUGE step in survival chests, food, CREEPERS!!!!  Here was when the subreddit was starting to get bigger and bigger. 0.5.0 soon came and was what made MCPE different from PC and XBox. The nether reactor, something unavailable in PC nor XBox without mods.
   We seem to forget how long MCPE has come and just keep asking and asking for stuff. What are we getting now... Signs? Online Multiplayer? Who knows? Maybe even squids? 
   I think we should remember that even though this is PE it's still Minecraft and in Minecraft there is endless possibilities."	t5_2tu23	True

I understand that you want to see awesome content and not paragraphs of text, but I just wanted to say something before it's too late. :) I just checked in after a 3 week hiatus from the internet to see that I have been removed as a moderator from /r/MCPE. I'd like you to know that there are no hard feelings. I've been finding lately that schoolwork has been piling on hard and I have no more time left for some of my other favorite things, like Reddit. :') This final period of my education (I won't give away too many details) is a crucial one, and I believe that I should really dig in so I can have a great future.

I believe that you guys are really going places with the community, and I am no longer able to pull my weight around here. You've made some strong and great choices for us.

My time has passed! Someday, I'll enjoy looking back on the legacy I left here. I'll laugh a lot, cry a little, and be amazed again at how far we have come. I truly love you guys, but it's like the age old quote:

*""If you love it, let it go. If it returns, it's yours. If it doesn't, it never was.""*

I let the community go, and it's clear you can fly on and away without me.

If I could have one last wish, it would be for /u/ASSinAssassin to take over as the WBC coordinator. I am confident that he will do a great job of it.

To all the friends I made here: I'll never forget you. I'm not going to do anything drastic like delete my account. I may not sign on that often, but if you ever want to shoot me a PM feel free. You can count on me to reply if it gets sent to my personal inbox! Souperlizard gets lonely too sometimes!

Maybe in the summer I can return for a longer period of time. If I can find it within me, I'd love to run the WBC again! If you'd have me. :P

There's more words than I can possibly fit in here. All I can say is, so long and thanks for all of the [sandwiches!](http://i.imgur.com/eUlBwom.jpg)

I actually love you guys. Purely platonic, of course!

See you around,

**You can find the original FAQ [here,](http://www.reddit.com/r/MCPE/comments/192zh6/official_rmcpe_frequently_asked_questions/) as well as on the [/r/MCPE wiki.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MCPE/wiki/index)**

##**Mob Traps/Grinders and related builds**

Many people ask how to make a mob grinder, or which one is best, or which one is easiest to build. I have no good answer to all these questions. 
**A good thing to do is to build your mob grinder in a large body of water, or wait for the next update with buckets to come. An example video on the grinder is [here,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kclXjsNDzeY) and in action, [here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYNLMtuccNo)**

You can also build [BananaPotion](http://www.reddit.com/user/BananaPotion)'s [mob sorter idea.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MCPE/comments/1awzf3/mob_sorter_in_mcpe/) It sorts your mobs nice and neat. Also, [here is the mob sorter in action](http://i.imgur.com/OTdwUOj.png) and [here is the creeper tactic](http://i.imgur.com/a7Zy0VF.png). 

##**Mushroom Farms**

Mushrooms will grow onto other blocks, but in order for this to happen, the growing mushroom must be in a dark area. They *can* grow outside of the darkness if another block is nearby, even if it is lit. [It happened to me.](http://i.imgur.com/vQpoIjq.png) No, I did not place that mushroom in the light.
Mushroom farms can basically be anywhere as long as that area is dark.

##**Sugar Cane**

Sugar cane (commonly called bamboo, or reeds) can be placed on sand, dirt, or grass blocks that are right next to water. It will eventually grow, up to three blocks above ground. Sugar cane farms cane be made by efficiently removing the water block that sugar cane requires. [Here is a good video example of a sugar cane farm.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xWpt8do238) 

##**The Nether Reactor**

The Nether Reactor is the MCPE version of the Nether dimension that is present on Minecraft PC. It is made from four gold blocks, fourteen cobblestone, and requires three diamonds and six iron to craft the Nether Reactor Core. ParalyzedFire made a [tutorial on how to build the reactor.](http://imgur.com/a/KEcyR)

##**Animal farms and Sheep**

On the PC Minecraft, underground rooms stuffed with animals actually serves a purpose, as you can breed them. On the Pocket Edition, there is nothing you can do with animals except kill them, or shear them, if they are sheep. Sheep can be sheared by crafting shears (two iron), and when the player presses and holds down on the screen on a sheep when carrying shears, the sheep will become sheared, and drop 1 to 3 wool blocks. Sheep cannot be sheared any other way, or sheared when they are ""naked"". Sheep with regrow their wool after eating a grass block, converting it into a dirt block. Sheep can also be dyed different colors by using the normal Minecraft dyes. The dyes can be applied to them by pressing and holding on a sheep while carrying a dye. When dyed sheep are sheared, they will drop dyed wool blocks corresponding to their color.

It is much easier to create farms when the world is freshly made, because animals are highly attracted to water, and will mostly end up floating in the middle of your lake, or pond. 

[How to collect animals.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os43UGz19QU)

##**Mob spawnage/despawnage**

Hostile mobs, such as Zombies, Creepers, Spiders, Zombie Pigmen, and Skeletons will despawn when the player is about 100 blocks away. Animals, such as Pigs, Chickens, Cows, and Sheep, will not despawn. The animals not caught in pens or farms will usually end up in water so your best option, if you want to create a farm, is to kill all the animals in your world and wait for the to respawn.

##**Mining**

Digging down to bedrock level, then going about three to six layers above, and mining out in a branch-like fashion is a good way to collect diamonds. Branch mining looks like [this.](http://i.imgur.com/L6UUzAM.png) 

You could also attempt [strip mining,](http://i.imgur.com/TDqOloJ.png) which is mining out a large area of diamonds.

If you like digging large holes down to bedrock level, [quarry mining](http://i.imgur.com/IZP5yIA.jpg) is for you.

###**Mods, map editing, or ""Hax""**


##**Backing up Android MCPE worlds, and Android Mods and Textures (no root required)**

The app [PocketInvEditor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.zhuoweizhang.pocketinveditor&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDNd) can be used to backup Android maps. Simply open up the application, click on the world you wish to back up, and tap Create backup. The backup file will be saved to sdcard&gt;games&gt;com.mojang&gt;minecraftWorlds_backup. This also works on PocketInvEditor Pro.

Another method for backup is the application [Ultimate Toolkit for MCPE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.chrismcmine.mcpemods&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDNd), most commonly known as the UTK. Once you have installed it, you can simply press the MAPbackup button, and from there, you can backup all your maps, delete all backups, or choose individual maps to backup and restore.

To install mods on BlockLauncher, download the mods you want and then open BlockLauncher. Press Options, then scroll down to Manage Patches. From there you can choose the patches you want.

You can also apply textures by using the Use Texture Pack option in the Options menu for BlockLauncher, and then select the .zip file that contains the texture you would like to use. You can also change the char.png file in the Mob folder for mob textures with your own skin file. Just rename your skin file char.png, and the game will run your skin.

##**Backing up iOS MCPE worlds**

Download [iExplorer](http://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/) or [iFunBox](http://www.i-funbox.com/) and navigate to something like this: &gt;Applications&gt;Minecraft PE&gt;Documents&gt;com.mojang&gt;minecraftWorlds. Then you can simply copy the worlds you wish onto your computer, or save them to Mediafire, Dropbox, or Box, or other online file storage systems. 

##**Skins**

You can get great skins on [The Skindex](http://www.minecraftskins.com/), or you can make your own at [Miners Need Cool Shoes](http://www.minershoes.com/) or [Skincraft.](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/571250)

 * **Android:** *No root:* Download the application [BlockLauncher Pro.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.zhuoweizhang.mcpelauncher.pro) It costs $1.71 USD, and is well worth it. Once you have opened the application, you can press the Options button on the main menu screen. Scroll down to Enable skin override and check it. The select the .png file you want to be your skin somewhere on your device. (You must have downloaded the skin file for this to work.)

Also, this works with BlockLauncher Free as well. 

* **iOS** *Jailbreak required* Admittedly, I have never done this, so I will have to take [/u/ASSinAssassin](http://www.reddit.com/user/ASSinAssassin)'s word for this process.

Backup your worlds using iFile or iFunBox.

Decrypt MCPE (this is mandatory for mods, texture, or other changes to the game) [How to](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-VsR9hBJuQ)

Get [MCPE Patcher.](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1391739-ios-mcpe-patcher/)

Paste in the link for the download of an iOS mod/skin into the application.

Add the mod to the MCPE patch, press patch.

Open Minecraft Pocket Edition.

###**Uploading images for Reddit**

* **Android:** Download [Imgur for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mitchbarry.imgur&amp;hl=nl) from the Play Store. From there, you can create albums, and upload pictures. The UI is very poor, though.

* **iOS:** iOS has several applications, I believe, which allow for uploading images to Imgur, like [this one.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imgurapp/id501416446?mt=8) However, that application is not capable of creating Albums. Also, you can use [Imgupr.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imgupr-photo-uploader-for/id498636755?mt=8)

* **Paralyzed Way** A while back, ParalyzedFire made a tutorial for iOS peoples, but this could work using a web browser on Android.

1362426862.0	19nmrp	The Apple Challenge! 	ParalyzedFire	53	13	50	"*For all you people who want to do something difficult or just for the hell of it!*

The Apple Challenge is a challenge that I made up. It's basically you have to survive in a world without touching most of the precious items. 

**RULES**

1)Can only eat apples

2)Every single tool that you use most involve a tree (That means you can't make anything else.)

3)Cobble is allowed, but no stone tools. (Stone tools would only be for armor though. So you only need a stone pickaxe.)

4) HAVE to have a tree and wheat farm. (Meaning no meat.)

5) Obviously no nether reactors

6) House must be underwater! (Making it difficult ;) This means that you have to find a way to make a farm underwater. Also you have to manage to make a waterfall decoration in their house!

7) Only animal you can kill is sheep! (Wool purposes)

8) I actually decided to allow iron (**SOLELY FOR ARMOR PURPOSES THOUGH**)

9)Hard part: The final part of this challenge is that you have to be one layer above bedrock and completely mine all of it. From one side of the world to all the others. &gt;:D

10) You can have someone help you, but only **one** person!

That is all the rules and I am still unsure whether or not to put a deadline. I'm going to participate as well. So yeah. Give it a shot guys!

**TL;DR** Go back and read the rules.

I'm no moderator, but if you guys could please upvote so everybody can see it! I won't get karma anyways. Thanks! :)

Have fun.

MCPE_Master_Builder was in charge of the whole new mod thang. Obviously, things didn't work out as expected and he wasn't on top of it. Like, at all. 

For those worrying about the activity of mods, we're working on it. I'm personally usually inactive due to situations not under my control, and SEA_TURTLES does fantastic things behind the scenes. This is another reason we're adding a new mod.

Me and SEA_TURTLES_BITCH will be taking lead and selecting a few of you that we've deemed mod quality and conducting interviews over a private IRC chat. If you don't get messaged by us, good luck in the future. :]

We're still deciding what to do with MCPE_Master_Builder. I've asked him to at the very least write an apology.

Please, don't take his comments as all of the mod's opinions. We don't support what he was saying and we were frankly quite shocked by them. It was unfortunate and unfair for you guys to be waiting. I'm very sorry, and I know the others are too. We do respect you, we do care, and we don't think we're better than you.

So, please, continue doing everything you guys do. We appreciate every single one of you and all you have to offer.

EitanWolf and the other mods

**TLDR: MCPE_Master_Builder was silly, we love you guys.**

(Also, if ya would, please upvote for visibility. No karma for me! :])

1358627748.0	16w4sd	Review Times - Explanation	ezekielelin	42	3	15	"I wanted to explain why the app has to get reviewed, why Android users have to wait, and how long it will take to get reviewed.

**1.** Review times for the iOS app store average to about 6 days. Source: [Shiny Development Review Times](http://reviewtimes.shinydevelopment.com)

**2.** Android users needing to wait is primarily a matter of fairness. When Android users didn't have to wait, Apple users complained just as much as you guys are complaining now. If you guys had to wait, and we didn't have review times, it would be the same, but reversed.

**3.** Apps need to be reviewed to ensure they will run. Believe it or not, companies make mistakes a lot, and apps would be updated with huge problems if Apple didn't review them. Mojang has, in the past, needed to resubmit Minecraft for review, therefor the 6 day estimate is relying on a successful submission.

My favorite world is a survival island that was ported from the PC.  It is FULL OF CAVES, has a lava layer, and everything, and DOES NOT LAG or run slow in the slightest.  I have noticed that the hostile mobs tend to spawn in caves that I haven't explored yet, and then not despawn at all, so it can be a little less challenging, but the game runs smoothly and the caves are in the ground.  Caving for ore is more fun than mining and that's that.

I don't understand why they can't add caves.  I don't think it's true that a phone can't run the game with caves.  I've played this PC port on an iPhone 3GS (old crap phone) and it ran fine.

1371356558.0	1gfs9d	Why Redstone isn't in MCPE yet	corbindavenport	41	9	17	"I see the question, ""When will redstone be added"" all the time on MCPE app reviews or sometimes here, so I wanted to try my best to explain why Redstone probably isn't coming anytime soon. Hopefully this will clear up any confusion :)

Redstone on the PC, if you have played it, has several different components. You have the wire, then the repeater as the basics. More recently you have things like comparators for more advanced Redstone-based machines. If you've played PC, you probably know how bad Redstone can make the game lag. When I have Redstone lamps flashing from a Redstone blinker, it can easily turn my game from a smooth 50 FPS to 16 FPS.

Now, imagine that on mobile devices. While some of us may have top-of-the-line smartphones and tablets (e.g. - iPhone 5, Galaxy S4, HTC One, etc), a majority of MCPE users don't. They have the older phones that came cheap or even free on their service plan (e.g. - iPhone 3GS, Droid 2, etc), the ones that can barely manage short rendering distance. Imagine trying to make Redstone machines on those. *shudder*

While the higher-end devices could most likely pull of basic, and possibly even advanced redstone machines, cheap and old phones couldn't. And if one device has it, all of them have to have it. Let's say Mojang did add in support for Redstone, can you guess what would happen? Most likely a flood of 1-star reviews saying Minecraft is terrible/laggy/crap, which would bring down the score of the app driving away new buyers.

So more than likely, Mojang is going to continue PE without Redstone until most of their user base is running devices capable of it. This might take a year or two, who knows? At least our favorite mobile game will be lag-free in the meantime, and there's already too many games with it (Dead Trigger I'm looking at you)."	t5_2tu23	True

I have a problem with the MCPE subreddit, and I'd like to address these problems. (This is a message that I want the community to see, so I'm not giving it to the mods first.)

1. The content on this subreddit is lacking. Its died down a bit, but I see a post about someones quarry every other post. I get it, quarries are cool and stuff. But seeing these pictures are boring and aren't very relevant at all.

2. The WBC, PRC, and MC are great! I like competing in them and have no problems with the posts for it, so there you go.

3. Update info. I understand that you guys are wanting the community to know about new updates and such, but 10 posts in rapid succession about some update being delayed is silly.

4. Updates for a build. There has been so many times when a user has 5-10 updates for a build. I think I'm speaking for everyone when I say WE DON'T CARE. We don't need to know when you found diamonds when building something, (its happened before) and we don't need a terrible WIP that looks nothing like the finished project. 

This is just by 2 cents on the subreddit. I want this subreddit to be fun and entertaining, but the content is lacking. I am in no way insulting the moderators or the community, I just want to see more!

Thanks
