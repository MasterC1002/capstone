1368143535.0	1e1aty	If architects had to work like programmers	whjms	211	37	17	"Dear Mr. Architect:

Please design and build me a house. I am not quite sure of what I need, so you should use your discretion.

My house should have between two and forty-five bedrooms. Just make sure the plans are such that the bedrooms can be easily added or deleted. When you bring the blueprints to me, I will make the final decision of what I want. Also, bring me the cost breakdown for each configuration so that I can arbitrarily pick one.

Keep in mind that the house I ultimately choose must cost less than the one I am currently living in. Make sure, however, that you correct all the deficiencies that exist in my current house (the floor of my kitchen vibrates when I walk across it, and the walls don't have nearly enough insulation in them).

As you design, also keep in mind that I want to keep yearly maintenance costs as low as possible. This should mean the incorporation of extra-cost features like aluminum, vinyl, or composite siding. (If you choose not to specify aluminum, be prepared to explain your decision in detail.)

Please take care that modern design practices and the latest materials are used in construction of the house, as I want it to be a showplace for the most up-to-date ideas and methods. Be alerted, however, that kitchen should be designed to accommodate, among other things, my 1952 Gibson refrigerator.

To insure that you are building the correct house for our entire family, make certain that you contact each of our children, and also our in-laws. My mother-in-law will have very strong feelings about how the house should be designed, since she visits us at least once a year. Make sure that you weigh all of thses options carefully and come to the right decision. I, however, retain the right to overrule any choices that you make.

Please don't bother me with small details right now. Your job is to develop the overall plans for the house: get the big picture. At this time, for example, it is not appropriate to be choosing the color of the carpet. However, keep in mind that my wife likes blue.

Also, do not worry at this time about acquiring the resources to build the house itself. Your first priority is to develop detailed plans and specifications. Once I approve these plans, however, I would expect the house to be under roof within 48 hours.

While you are designing this house specifically for me, keep in mind that sooner or later I will have to sell it to someone else. It therefore should have appeal to a wide variety of potential buyers. Please make sure before you finalize the plans that there is a consensus of the population in my area that they like the features this house has.

I advise you to run up and look at my neighbor's house he constructed last year. We like it a great deal. It has many features that we would also like in our new home, particularily the 75-foot swimming pool. With careful engineering, I believe that you can design this into our new house without impacting the final cost.

Please prepare a complete set of blueprints. It is not necessary at this time to do the real design, since they will be used only for construction bids. Be advised, however, that you will be held accountable for any increase of construction costs as a result of later design changes.

You must be thrilled to be working on as an interesting project as this! To be able to use the latest techniques and materials and to be given such freedom in your designs is something that can't happen very often. Contact me as soon as possible with your complete ideas and plans.

PS: My wife has just told me that she disagrees with many of the instructions I've given you in this letter. As architect, it is your responsibility to resolve these differences. I have tried in the past and have been unable to accomplish this. If you can't handle this responsibility, I will have to find another architect.

PPS: Perhaps what I need is not a house at all, but a travel trailer. Please advise me as soon as possible if this is the case. "	t5_2tex6	True

Hi Sysadmins,

I’ve got a real doozie for you guys today. There is a bug in my machine. Specifically in my LCD monitor somewhere between the polarizing filter and the reflective backplane. It’s about a millimeter across. It was crawling around and running away from my mouse cursor, but is now completely smashed between some of the substrates of the screen. 

Here’s the list of actions I’ve taken so far to try to fix the situation.

1)	Called my boss in to laugh about the fact that I’ve got a bug in my machine

2)	Tried turning it off and on again

3)	Tried restoring to factory settings

4)	Tried selecting and dragging him to the trash can

5)	Tried replacing that section of screen with dark background (this worked, but only briefly, until it crawled off that section)

6)	Tried naming him Colin in an effort to befriend him and coax him out through reasoned discussion.

7)	Tried turning up brightness level of display to roast him out

8)	Tried tapping area of screen near him to scare him off. Unfortunately at this point he stopped moving and I got worried, tapped a little harder, and noticed that he started to smear. Oops.

So I’m out of ideas. 

Compressed air has been suggested, but I don’t have any cans.

Help me sysadministrators, You’re my only hope!

-Me

Pictures (screenshots?) to come later once I get back to work.

Intelligent design sort is a sorting algorithm based on the theory of intelligent design.

**Algorithm Description**

The probability of the original input list being in the exact order it's in is 1/(n!). There is such a small likelihood of this that it's clearly absurd to say that this happened by chance, so it must have been consciously put in that order by an intelligent Sorter. Therefore it's safe to assume that it's already optimally Sorted in some way that transcends our naïve mortal understanding of ""ascending order"". Any attempt to change that order to conform to our own preconceptions would actually make it less sorted.

**Analysis**

This algorithm is constant in time, and sorts the list in-place, requiring no additional memory at all. In fact, it doesn't even require any of that suspicious technological computer stuff. Praise the Sorter!

***

**Feedback**

Gary Rogers writes:
Making the sort constant in time denies the power of The Sorter. The Sorter exists outside of time, thus the sort is timeless. To require time to validate the sort dimishes the role of the Sorter. Thus... this particular sort is flawed, and can not be attributed to 'The Sorter'.
Heresy!

Oh, and [here's a pastebin link](http://pastebin.com/buCDXqP5) if you prefer that over a self-post here.

--------------------

A programmer goes to the shop to buy some milk. His wife calls and says ""While you're out, get some eggs."" 
and he never returns ...

--------------------

A man flying in a hot air balloon suddenly realizes he’s lost. He reduces height and spots a man down below. 
He lowers the balloon further and shouts to get directions, ""Excuse me, can you tell me where I am?""

The man below says: ""Yes, you're in a hot air balloon, hovering 30 feet above this field.""

""You must work in Information Technology,"" says the balloonist.

""I do"" replies the man. ""How did you know?""

""Well,"" says the balloonist, ""everything you have told me is technically correct, but it's of no use to anyone.""

The man below replies, ""You must work in management.""

""I do"" replies the balloonist, ""But how'd you know?""

""Well"", says the man, ""you don’t know where you are, or where you’re going, you expect me to be able to help. 
You’re in the same position you were before we met, but now it’s my fault.""

--------------------

Programmer's girlfriend: ""Are you going to sit and type in front of that thing all day or are you going out with me?""     
Programmer: ""Yes.""

--------------------

A young man was walking along in the forest, when he heard a muffled voice crying for help from behind a log.  
He leaned over to see a frog sitting in the mud.

The frog looked up at him and said, ""I'm actually a beautiful princess, and if you kiss me, I'll transform back into my true self, and be yours for eternity.""

Silently, the man scooped up the frog and continued on his walk.

A minute or two later, the frog piped up again, ""Hey, buddy, maybe you didn't hear me -- I said, if you kiss me, I'll turn into a princess. What are you waiting for?""

Annoyed, the man stuffed the frog into his coat pocket.

Shocked, the frog yelled from inside the man's pocket, ""What the hell?  I'm a princess!  All you have to do is kiss me!""

Opening his pocket and peering in, the man said, ""Listen -- I'm a software engineer.  I don't have time for a girlfriend.  But a talking frog is kind of cool.""

--------------------

Q. How many software engineers does it take to change a light bulb?    
A. None. It's a hardware problem.

--------------------

Q. How did the programmer die in the shower?    
A. He read the shampoo bottle instructions: Lather. Rinse. Repeat.

(meta-joke: Eventually the bottle would be empty and an exception would be raised.)

--------------------

A computer engineer, a systems analyst, and a programmer were driving down a mountain when the brakes gave out.     
They screamed down the mountain, gaining speed, and finally managed to grind to a halt, more by luck than anything else, 
just inches from a thousand foot drop to jagged rocks. They all got out of the car.    

The computer engineer said, ""I think I can fix it.""

The systems analyst said, ""No, I think we should take it into town and have a specialist look at it.""

The programmer said, ""I think we should push it back up the hill and see if it does it again.""

--------------------

My wife said:
""Honey, please go to the market and buy 1 bottle of milk. If they have eggs, bring 6.""

I came back with 6 bottles of milk.

She said, ""Why the hell did you buy 6 bottles of milk?""

I said, ""Because they had eggs!!""

--------------------

What did the suicidal function say? ""GOODBYE WORLD""

How do functions break up? ""They stop calling each other!""

When is a function a bad investment? ""When there's no return""

What happened to the function that ran away? ""It never returned""

When do two functions fight? ""When they have arguments""

In what unit do you measure a function's length? ""In Para meters...""

What did the flirtatious function say? ""Call me ;)""

What happened to all the illegal exceptions? ""They were all caught!""

What do threads do after they make love? ""They go to sleep""

Why do we rarely see a program with crooked teeth? ""Because most of them have braces""

--------------------

There are 2 hard problems in computer science: caching, naming, and off-by-1 errors.

--------------------

Q. What's the difference between an enterprise software salesperson and a used car dealer?    
A. The used car dealer knows when he's lying.

--------------------

Javascript : Java :: Carpet : Car

--------------------

Four engineers are driving to a conference when their car breaks down.  
A civil engineer in the front seat suggests that the slope of the road will allow them to pick up speed quickly if they push the car, at which point they can pop the clutch.
The other three engineers laugh.
A chemical engineer theorizes that there was something bad in the gasoline that caused the engine to fail, so a simple trip to a gas station would fix the problem.
The other two engineers laugh.
A mechanical engineer offers to look under the hood and identify the part of the engine that is broken, allowing them to go to an auto parts store and fix the problem.
The remaining engineer laughs.
The software engineer says ""You folks are making this too complicated, just turn it off and turn it on again.

--------------------

I wrote this function. Its name is meMaybe()    
so that you can call meMaybe()

--------------------

A guy is standing on the corner of the street smoking one cigarette after another. 
A lady walking by notices him and says ""Hey, don't you know that those things can kill you? I mean, didn't you see the giant warning on the box?!"" 
""That's OK"" says the guy, puffing casually, ""I'm a computer programmer"" 
""So? What's that got to do with anything?"" 
""We don't care about warnings. We only care about errors.""

--------------------

Rule of Software Programming: Any sufficiently advanced bug is an alpha feature.

--------------------
 
Man:  ""Make me a sandwich""    
Woman:  ""No""    
Man:  ""sudo Make me a sandwich""    
Woman:  ""Okay""    

--------------------

Man:  ""Make me a sandwich""
Woman:  ""No""
Man:  ""sudo Make me a sandwich""
Woman:  ""You are not in sudoers list. The incident will be reported.""

Q. What did the programmer say when his friend didn't know how to use a for statement?
A. ""You're out of the loop!""

--------------------

I have a joke about UDP.    
But you might not get it.

Your mother is so fat,    
the recursive function computing her mass causes a stack overflow.

I called the janitor the other day to see what he could do about my dingy linoleum floor. He said he would have been happy to loan me a polisher, but that he hadn't the slightest idea what he had done with it. I told him not to worry about it - that as a programmer it wasn't the first time I had experienced a buffer allocation failure due to a memory error.

A group of ten top software engineers is sent to a class for aspiring managers. The teacher walks in and asks this question:

""You work for a software company which develops avionics (software that controls the instruments of an airplane). One day you are taking a business trip. As you get on the plane you see a plaque that says this plane is using a beta of the software your team developed. Who would get off?""

Nine developers raised their hands. The teacher looked at the tenth and asked, ""Why would you stay on?""

The tenth said, ""if my team wrote the software, the plane would not get off the ground, much less crash.""

--------------------

Once upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on the side of a deserted road. Suddenly a brand new Porsche screeches to a halt. The driver, a man dressed in an Armani suit, Cerutti shoes, Ray-Ban sunglasses, TAG-Heuer wrist-watch, and a Versace tie, gets out and asks the Shepherd:

Man: “If I can tell you how many sheep you have, will you give me one of them?”

The shepherd looks at the young man, and then looks at the large flock of grazing sheep and replies: 

Shepherd: “Okay.”

The young man parks the car, connects his laptop to the mobile-fax, enters a NASA Webster, scans the ground using his GPS, opens a database and 60 Excel tables filled with logarithms and pivot tables, then prints out a 150 page report on his high-tech mini-printer. He turns to the shepherd and says,

Man: “You have exactly 1,586 sheep here.”

The shepherd cheers, 

Shepherd: “That’s correct, you can have your sheep.”

The young man makes his pick and puts it in the back of his Porsche. The shepherd looks at him and asks,

Shepherd: “If I guess your profession, will you return my animal to me?”

The young man answers; 

Man: “Yes, why not?”

Shepherd: ""You are an IT consultant.""

Man: “How did you know?”

Shepherd: “Very simple. First, you came here without being called. Second, you charged me a fee to tell me something I already knew, and third, you don’t understand anything about my business…Now can I have my DOG back?""

Unix is user friendly. It's just very particular about who its friends are.

Hunting elephants:

MATHEMATICIANS hunt elephants by going to Africa, throwing out everything that is not an elephant, and catching one of whatever is left.

EXPERIENCED MATHEMATICIANS will attempt to prove the existence of at least one unique elephant before proceeding to step 1 as a subordinate exercise.

PROFESSORS OF MATHEMATICS will prove the existence of at least one unique elephant and then leave the detection and capture of an actual elephant as an exercise for their graduate students.

COMPUTER SCIENTISTS hunt elephants by exercising Algorithm A: 
-Go to Africa.
-Start at the Cape of Good Hope.
-Work northward in an orderly manner, traversing the continent alternately east and west.
-During each traverse pass, 
--Catch each animal seen.
--Compare each animal caught to a known elephant.
--Stop when a match is detected. 
EXPERIENCED COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS modify Algorithm A by placing a known elephant in Cairo to ensure that the algorithm will terminate.

ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE PROGRAMMERS prefer to execute Algorithm A on their hands and knees.

ENGINEERS hunt elephants by going to Africa, catching gray animals at random, and stopping when any one of them weighs within plus or minus 15 percent of any previously observed elephant.

ECONOMISTS don't hunt elephants, but they believe that if elephants are paid enough, they will hunt themselves.

STATISTICIANS hunt the first animal they see N times and call it an elephant.

CONSULTANTS don't hunt elephants, and many have never hunted anything at all, but they can be hired by the hour to advise those people who do.

OPERATIONS RESEARCH CONSULTANTS can also measure the correlation of hat size and bullet color to the efficiency of elephant-hunting strategies, if someone else will only identify the elephants.

POLITICIANS don't hunt elephants, but they will share the elephants you catch with the people who voted for them.

LAWYERS don't hunt elephants, but they do follow the herds around arguing about who owns the droppings.

SOFTWARE LAWYERS will claim that they own an entire herd based on the look and feel of one dropping.

VICE PRESIDENTS OF ENGINEERING, RESEARCH, AND DEVELOPMENT try hard to hunt elephants, but their staffs are designed to prevent it. When the vice president does get to hunt elephants, the staff will try to ensure that all possible elephants are completely prehunted before the vice president sees them. If the vice president does happen to see a elephant, the staff will: 
-compliment the vice president's keen eyesight and
-enlarge itself to prevent any recurrence.

SENIOR MANAGERS set broad elephant-hunting policy based on the assumption that elephants are just like field mice, but with deeper voices.

QUALITY ASSURANCE INSPECTORS ignore the elephants and look for mistakes the other hunters made when they were packing the jeep.

SALES PEOPLE don't hunt elephants but spend their time selling elephants they haven't caught, for delivery two days before the season opens.

SOFTWARE SALES PEOPLE ship the first thing they catch and write up an invoice for an elephant.

HARDWARE SALES PEOPLE catch rabbits, paint them gray, and sell them as desktop elephants.

A programmer puts two glasses on his bedside table before going to sleep. A full one, in case he gets thirsty, and an empty one, in case he doesn't.

The code line being reviewed:

    if (currentQueryType.name().equalsIgnoreCase(""ALL_THE_WORDS"")) { 
        ...
    }


Where currentQueryType is enum defined elsewhere as:

    public enum QueryType { 
        BOOLEAN, DOCUMENT_IDS , ALL_THE_WORDS, ANY_OF_THE_WORDS, LITERAL_PHRASES; 
    }


**Reviewer:**

(Inwardly: WTF?) Please refactor with switch-case statement

**Offshore tech-lead:**

this does not work:

    switch (type.ordinal()){
        case 0:
        ...
        case 1:
        ...
    }


**Reviewer:**

???
Do something like this:

    switch (type) {
        case DOCUMENT_IDS:
        ...
        case ALL_THE_WORDS 
        ...
    }


**Offshore tech-lead:**

this does not work neither:

 
**Reviewer:**

Of course it does, mind to show me compiler output

**Offshore tech-lead:**

i think this may be due to switch case using === idnetity operator where as if then else we were doing a direct == comparison: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2573145/switch-case-for-strings-in-javascript-not-working-as-expected 


**Reviewer:**

we are not writing javascript, it is java!


**Offshore tech-lead:**

but what i see with my switch case is this : it evaluates all cases as true, instead of one 
when I use the ordinal instead of the type it evaluates the matching ordinal as true, but then goes on to evaluate the bigger values as true as well. 
so if the ordinal matching is 2, then both case 2 and case 3 are executed 
can i send you the code? so you can try on your machine? 


**Reviewer:**


did u forget to put break; after each case?

 
**Offshore tech-lead:**

um. i put a break before and after the switch case. so i can traverse through using f6

 
**Reviewer:**

i am not talking about breakpoints, but the break statement!  google java switch case

 
**Offshore tech-lead:**

The car was getting faster and faster, they were struggling to get round the corners and once or twice only the feeble crash barrier saved them from crashing down the side of the mountain. They were sure they were all going to die, when suddenly they spotted an escape lane. They pulled into the escape lane, and came safely to a halt.

The physicist said ""We need to model the friction in the brake pads and the resultant temperature rise, see if we can work out why they failed"".

The engineer said ""I think I've got a few spanners in the back. I'll take a look and see if I can work out what's wrong"".

If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port,  
and the bus is interrupted at a very last resort,  
and the access of memory the makes your floppy disk abort,  
then the socket packet pocket has an error to report.  


If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash,  
and the double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash,  
and your data is corrupted cause the index doesn't hash,  
then the situation's hopeless and your system's gonna crash.  

If the label on the cable on the table at your house,  
says the network is connected to the button on the mouse,  
but your packets want to tunnul to another protocol,  
that's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall.  

Your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss,  
so your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse,  
then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang,  
coz sure as i'm a poet, the sucker's gonnan hang.  

When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy in the disk,  
and the macrocode instructions cause unnecessary risk.  
Then you'll have to flash the memory and you'll want to RAM your ROM,  
Quickly turn off the computer and be sure to tell your Mom!

1341664196.0	w6c9j	Loading a database in various languages	sfsdfd	29	5	2	"A flash of inspiration / frustration prompted this summary of the experience of loading a database in various programming languages.

**Assembly:**

Memory address A contains a filename. Invoke the Load function at address X, specifying address A. From register M, retrieve address C containing the database metadata. Make an empty buffer at address D. Invoke the Load function at address Y, specifying address C and address D. Read register N, specifying the number of loaded records, and read the N records from address D.

**C/C++:**

Open the file. The file is a database. Create a read query string. Issue the metadata query string. Get the query result. The query result is database metadata. From the database metadata, read the tables. For each table, create a table query string. Issue the table query string. Get the query result. The query result is a record. Read the data from the record. The data is a record field. Store the record field in a data structure.

**C#/Java:**

Please ask the DatabaseManager to ask the FileManager to read the database use the DatabaseFileReader. Then please ask the DatabaseTableIterator to parse the DatabaseMemoryRepresentation object formatted with this DatabaseStructureDeserializer and put the results into a DatabaseTableRecordIterator class. If something goes wrong, please stop and say, ""Something Went Wrong.""

**Perl:**

Database load do tables from file into with attributes records ready go.

**Lisp:**

A ""file"" is an object stored in a file system. A ""record"" is a collection of data. A ""table"" is a collection of ""records"". A ""database"" has objects including ""tables."" ""Load"" means ""retrieve"" the ""records"" of the ""tables"" of a ""database."" Please ""load"" the ""database"" in the ""file.""

**Web Programming:**

If the database is version 1.0 or you're wearing blue socks, please load the tables of the database from the file system. If the database is version 1.1, and if you're wearing either red socks or white socks, please read in the database from the memory system that may be a file system, and store it as a set of tables; but if you're wearing PURPLE socks, please ask the file system to examine the database, and then store it locally as a set of records in a table. However, if you *were* wearing red socks but have switched to white or blue, please ignore all of that and instead read in the database as a set of objects and parse those objects as records. If the database is version 1.2...

**Flash:**

Please update your Database to Database version 2.0 and try again.

**Objective-C:**

Harken! And kindly turn thine Eye unto yon File in thy Filesystem, wherefor such File (which is a Database) contains Tables. Further, underftand that said Database (which is a File) in turn presenteth upon thy memory Records (which are Data Structures) which, like the petals within the Tulip, harbor a set of Fields (which are Data). Prithee, upon thy first Convenience, endeavour to retrieve faid File (which is still a Database) and render unto thy Memory Buffer the Fields (which are ftill Data); and at length, I entreateth thee to release the Database, the File, the Tables, the Records, the Attributes, and, upon concluding thy Purpose, the Memory Buffers from thy bondage thenceforth.

(I kind of imagine the LISPing toad to be the cousin of Hypnotoad from Futurama.)


That LISPing toad! That LISPing toad!

I do not like that LISPing toad!

Would you write recursive code?

I do not like it, LISPing Toad

I do not write recursive code


Would you write me one base case?

I would not write you one base case.

In my while loop it has no place.

I do not like recursive code.

I do not like it, LISPing toad.


Would you like to cons a list?

Cons list to list to list to list?

I would not like to cons a list.

In C this word does not exist!

I will not write you one base case.

In my while loop It has no place.

I do not write recursive code.

I do not like it, LISPing toad!


Would you, could you, cdr, car?

I would not, could not cdr, car.

The way you code is just bizarre!

I would not like to cons a list.

In C this word does not exist.

I will not write you one base case.

In my while loop it has no place.

I do not write recursive code.

I do not like it, LISPing toad.


Then, if I may be so bold

How ‘bout trying map or fold?

No map or fold; it’s a mistake—

A function can’t a function take!

I do not like this cdr, car.

These commands won’t take me far.

I do not want to cons a list,

And your base cases won’t be missed.

I do not like recursive code.

I do not like it, LISPing toad.


Try lambda! Lambda!

Lambda calc!

Could you, would you,

Lambda calc?

No Lambda calc! No map or fold!

And car and cdr leave me cold.

I will not write you one base case,

In my while loop it has no place.

I would not, could not, cons a list.

I would not, could not, I resist!

I do not like recursive code,

I WILL NOT WRITE IT, LISPing toad!!!


You do not like it,

So you say

Try it! Try it!

And you may.


Toad!

If you will let me be

I will try it,

You will see.


[ narrator takes comp 105 ]

Say!

Toad!

I like recursive code!

I do! I like it, LISPing toad!

This lambda calc—it’s pretty neat!

And map and fold work like a treat!

And now I know, make no mistake,

A function CAN a function take!

Car and cdr, cadr, caar

How useful these new functions are!

I’m consing list on list on list

I can’t believe all that I’ve missed!

And I will write you one base case

And then recurse 'til outer space!

Now I love recursive code.

Thank you, thank you,

Once, towards the end of an 80 hour week, some of the guys in the office were discussing whether or not their wives cook. Unconsciously, I started iterating through the guys in the office:

    Kevin.wife.cooks == true; 
    Ed.wife.cooks == true;

As the only single guy in the office, I visibly flinched when my brain got to neurohero.wife.cooks and threw a null pointer exception.

It had a boolean named ""**trigger**"" (no additional information, just trigger)

But there were some cases that would trigger the said trigger if some events would occur twice in a row. For that occasion they had a variable called **triggerTrigger**

Last thing this code needs is a method to activate the whole mess. I'd suggest a method named **triggerTriggerTrigger()**    "	t5_2tex6	True

Think of it as a TheDailyWTF, but on reddit and with content that is directly submitted and presented by users. I'm sure we all have ridiculous stories from our workplaces that have to do with software-engineering or programming; this is the place to share them! 

For example:

 - Recall any horrible code you worked on recently?
 - Is your workplace dysfunctional?
 - Has management come down with any brain-dead decisions lately?
 - Are you working with any ""rockstars"" or ""ninjas""?
 - Was the CEO's nephew hired to write the company's flagship product?
 - Did you have a horrible interviewing experience?
