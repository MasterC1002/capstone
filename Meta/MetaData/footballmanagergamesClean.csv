**Real Name and German National Team Fix**
This file is CRUCIAL and needs to be installed before you start a new FM Career. It fixes various things such as real club and competition names that the game doesn't have licences for. But most importantly it makes the German National team work. Without this fix the German national team will appear with greyed out fake players rather than real German players. I think there's also problems with the Japanese national team as well, but i'm not 100% sure.

* [FM 13 Real Name and German National Team Fix](http://sortitoutsi.net/downloads/view/932/fm13-real-names-fixes-file-beta)

**Football Manager Skins**
FM Skins completely change the look and layout of the game. I only know of 4 that have been released so far, which is a bit of a shame. But check them out anyway:

* [Steklo X3](http://sortitoutsi.net/downloads/view/1422/steklo-x3) (my recommendation it's awesome)
* [Carbon Skin](http://sortitoutsi.net/downloads/view/2325/carbon-skin-2013) - Also available from [FM Scout](http://www.fmscout.com/a-fm13-skin-carbon-2013.html)
* [OPZ Beam Skin](http://www.fmscout.com/a-fm13-skin-opz-beam-v5.html)
* [Alavanja Darkness](http://sortitoutsi.net/downloads/view/2316/alavanja-13-darkness)

**FM Editors and Tools**
FM Genie Scout lets you.... well cheat basically. You can use it without cheating, but lets be honest it really is a cheat tool. Basically it lets you search the FM Database for all the best players instantly, including hidden attributes and things like potential ability. So you know for sure if your young players are wonderkids or not.

* [FM Genie Scout](http://www.fmscout.com/a-fm-genie-scout-13.html)

**Football Manager Facepacks**
Facepacks basically add thousands of new player faces to the game that aren't included by default. The biggest one is the cut out faces pack, which has been going for years and has over 100,000 (I think?) new faces in the original cut out format, but there are others which have various graphical backgrounds, pick whichever you likely (obviously).

* [Cut Out Megapack](http://sortitoutsi.net/graphics/style/1/cut-out-player-faces)
* [DF11 Megapack](http://sortitoutsi.net/graphics/style/9/df11-player-faces) - also available via a [dutch site](http://forum.manutd.nl/showthread.php?47337-DF11-Megapacks-amp-Updates) who I think originally made it
* [Scope Megapack](http://www.fmscout.com/a-scope-faces-megapack-for-fm13.html)
* [Panini Faces Megapack](http://www.fmscout.com/a-fm13-panini-faces-megapack.html)

**Football Manager Logos**
Same as above really except these packs add new and improved logos to the game

* [Metallic Logos](http://sortitoutsi.net/graphics/style/3/metallic-logos) (126,000 new logos)
* [FM View Megapack](http://forum.fm-view.net/files/view/2-fmv13-megapack) (10,000 new logos)
* [SPS Logos](http://www.fmscout.com/a-sps-logos-megapack-for-fm13.html) (3,500 new logos)

**Football Manager Kits**
Guess what? yeah same as above except this adds new and improved kits in various styles

* [SS Kits](http://sortitoutsi.net/graphics/style/2/ss10-13-kits) - (Awesome my favourite)
* [LS Kits](http://sortitoutsi.net/graphics/style/6/ls11-13-kits) - These are the same as above but long sleeved I think
* [Standard Kits](http://sortitoutsi.net/graphics/style/7/standard-kits) - Standard kits same as default

**In Game Kits**
I thought i'd list these separately. These update the kits in the pitch view of the match engine so are separate to the above kits.

* [3D Kits](http://sortitoutsi.net/graphics/style/8/3d10-13-kits)

**Paying for downloads from sortitoutsi**
I know sometimes i've recommended sortitoutsi to people and they think they're being scammed for money. If you scroll to the bottom there are always free links to download the stuff as well. I've been downloading stuff from there for years and they're legitimate. The site nearly closed last year due to bills I think so if you do have the cash to donate to them i'm sure they'd appreciate it :)"	t5_2s0w5	True

1369581014.0	1f30ff	New Manager Guide - Part 1: Setting up	_sicksense	139	16	24	"As promised, I've put together a bit of a guide for beginners to FM. Now, I initially started it as a way to just put together some tips &amp; tricks but it’s become far more comprehensive than that so I’m going to split this into a few separate posts that should be a full walkthrough for new players.

With Football Manager becoming increasingly more complicated year by year it’s understandable that new managers get a bit lost when starting out. I’ve loaded up a new team to run through transfers, tactics, developing talent, etc.

I’ve picked a 3rd tier side since I could give out a broader range of advice for fans of lower league management which still applies to bigger clubs. Hopefully it’s enough to help out beginners. And if more experienced players have anything to add to this feel free, I’ll edit it in.

**Part 1: Setting up**

*Staff*

After you’ve picked a team, it’s tempting to jump straight into the transfers and tactics but we need to take care of a few things first. 

Once you start getting deep into the game you’re almost definitely going to rely on your assistant manager to take care of various things, so that’s the first thing you should sort out. I personally rely on him very heavily to take care of my press conferences and opposition instructions and [mine simply isn’t good enough](http://i.imgur.com/xRCi07j.png) to do either.

If you need to then mutually terminate the contract and head straight for the Staff Search. Your Assistant Manager should be the go-to guy. He can be your tactics expert, your voice in the media, a coach and a scout.

* For the attributes, Tactical Knowledge is the big one. It helps with your opposition instructions prior to matches and also dictates his tactical feedback during a match. You should be looking for someone with at least a 15 in that area.

* The Motivating attribute helps in team talks and I believe it does have some impact on press conferences as well (Media Handling Style impacts that more).

* Judging Ability/Potential is a good option as he'll provide more accurate team reports and you can also have him recruiting young players to the club.

* If you don’t have too many coaches you might want someone with good Determination, Working With Youngsters, Man Management, Level of Discipline and some coaching attributes so he can help with training players.

Unfortunately at my level, I can’t be too specific or I won’t have any realistic targets. [I’ve only picked Motivating and Tactical knowledge](http://i.imgur.com/Y7EKd7h.png) since they will be most important for my uses and [I’ve still found a good assistant](http://i.imgur.com/lFgNz3C.png). 

If you’re at a bigger club and have the funds you should look to fill out your quota of staff which you can find on your [Boardroom Overview page](http://i.imgur.com/2V57Bwy.png). My budget is far too low and I’d rather use it on signing players so I’m going to leave my coaching staff as is.

When looking for coaches you should look for the same attributes as the final point in the search for a good Assistant Manager.

* Every one of your coaches should have good Determination, Working With Youngsters, Man Management, Level of Discipline attributes. Then you need to find variety of coaches who specialise in attack, defence or tactics to cover all bases.

Once you have your backroom staff set, [let’s go to the training section and assign the coaches to their individual tasks](http://i.imgur.com/W5orZH4.png). You can ask your assistant to deal with it but do a quick check to make sure you don’t have any of your coaches doing the wrong job.

*Staff Responsibilities*

The last thing to take care of before we get into the squad is one of the new features in this year’s FM. Delegating through the [Staff Responsibilities](http://i.imgur.com/XkHpwmR.png) is vital in making sure your club runs smoothly. Generally the only people who are going to be involved here are the Director of Football, Head of Youth Development, Chief Scout and yourself i.e. your best judges of ability and potential.

I have my Director of Football deal with first team transfers and the Head of Youth Dev take care of youth transfers. You want both of them to have good Judging Player Ability and Potential attributes though through this year’s game I’ve found that the stats haven’t made much of a difference in the way your DoF performs. The HoYD, on the other hand, really needs those attributes to bring the best possible youngsters into your club. 

*Of course, it’s not necessary that you use your Head of Youth for this, you should assign the best judge of potential as the one to bring youth players into the club at the bottom of the screen.*

**Trick:** You can assign your Chairman to take care of your first team transfers if you’re a poorer club as he’ll ignore the budget sometimes to sign a player.

*Squad*

The first thing to do would be to look at the [Team Report](http://i.imgur.com/Sg62HXW.png) and with a quick glance you can already see where your weaknesses lie. The star system can be misleading when it comes to Current Ability but it’s a good way to spot potential weaknesses in a squad you don’t know.

The Team Report was spot on about my weakest player, Danilo Zini. But the 2nd best right back in the team is young and has potential. 

The next weak area of my team is up front. None of the strikers on the team are good enough so I'm going to let these players go and find replacements. My midfield is strong and I am leaning towards a 4-3-3 with just one striker up front so I’ll be looking for one starter and a backup.

Jump into the reserves and youth teams to see if there’s a suitable replacement who was ignored by the previous manager. You find some real gems sometimes. Unfortunately, I didn’t find anyone in my ranks so we’ll have to sign some strikers.

Before I head to the Player Search though I’m going to go onto my squad page, hit the View at the top left and look at my [Assistant Report](http://i.imgur.com/Npndr4P.png). Just by sorting the squad by Potential you can figure out where the deadwood is.

The younger players at the bottom of that list should be released because they won’t be of much use once you get promoted. Have a look through the older players at the bottom and if their wages don’t match their ability, let them go as well. It's vital you get rid of players you don't need when you don't have much money to spend.

*Player Search*

Before signing anyone, it’s a good idea to think of what kind of formation you want to play and build the team around that. If you’re in the lower leagues I’d advise you take your time with your team. People usually want to play attractive football that requires more of your players than they’re capable of. Keep it simple until you have a squad capable of playing a more complex passing game. 

And now we get to the fun part.

There’s a lot you can do in the Player Search to find exactly what you’re looking for. Since I don’t have much money to spend, I adjusted the budget to give me more wages in my Boardroom Overview and I’m going to go right to the Free Transfers. Whether you’re looking for transfer listed players, ones to be loaned out or just doing a general player search the following will still apply.

There’s many different things you can do with the filters once you know what you’re looking for. 

* Since I’m out for a striker [I’m going to use the Pick Attributes filter to pick a striker with good pace, finishing and composure](http://i.imgur.com/Wyvqnj5.png) - you don’t really need to go much further when looking for lower league forwards. However, you will want to get more elaborate the higher up your team is. Using [guidetofootballmanager’s list of key attributes](http://www.guidetofootballmanager.com/players/player-attributes/key-attributes) comes in handy when looking for specific types of players using the filters.

* You can also look through your scout reports in their entirety by using the Scouted Current/Potential Ability filter which is one of the easier ways to find players since they already have a verdict from your scouts and you can sort them by their ability. [I’ve narrowed it down further](http://i.imgur.com/PRVPMmc.png) to the role I want my striker playing. Like I said earlier, I want to play a 4-3-3 in which the lone striker will probably have to do a lot of work on his own so an Advanced or Complete Forward would be a good option here.

* If you have an especially good player, right click his name and hit the Find Similar Players option. This will pick their strongest attributes and find you a player in a similar mould. This is great for rotational purposes when you have an elaborate tactic that is specific to certain players.

**Trick:** The [International Caps filter is a hidden gem](http://i.imgur.com/fZZOmsD.png) when it comes to finding some great older players. You can use the Youth Caps filter as well. **EDIT:** You'll probably get a lot of players from obscure places but you can use the Nationality filter to find players from bigger countries.

* Loaning from bigger clubs is another common practice at lower leagues. It’s a great way to get players you otherwise wouldn’t be able to without having to pay wages but don’t get carried away. I approach my team with the idea that you need to have a squad capable of surviving comfortably in the league above you before you get there and a squad made up of too many loaned in players doesn’t ensure that. Once they're gone you’ll have too many spaces to fill without the resources to do so. *Don’t be afraid to lose a few games on purpose and stay in a lower league if you feel your team isn’t ready.*

**EDIT:** As /u/Ajinho points out, getting a good parent club can be very useful in the lower leagues for getting better players in on loan for no wages as well as giving you a small financial boost at the start of the season.

At the end of this you ideally want around 22-24 players in your first team squad. This would mean a starting eleven with one backup for most positions. I say most because you shouldn’t have too many backups in central positions. For example, if I have three starting central midfielders, I only have two players for cover since it’s easier to rotate them and give them all fair playing time. In addition to that you’ll want some versatile players who can fill in at multiple positions in case of an injury crisis. 


**Now that you have your team set up, we can get into the meat of the game. [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/1fasld/new_manager_guide_part_2_preseason/)covers tactics and how to tweak them during preseason to get ready for the start of the season [Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/1fjnrl/new_manager_guide_part_3_developing_talent/) covers how to develop talent.**

1348247959.0	1098vb	"The rise of Paganese: ""Corruption, Blasphemy, Revenge and Glory"""	santoscrew	91	7	27	"This all started when I got the Atalanta job. I already posted about my [first season](http://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/wdwgu/one_of_the_best_1st_seasons_ive_played/) in which I had to battle against relegation but ended up securing a 4th place in the Serie A which through some luck got converted into a Champions League Qualifyer spot. 

The season that followed really tested my patience as I lost in the CL Qualifyers against Dinamo Kiev. Seven matches into the new season [the Atalanta chairman even fired me!](http://i.imgur.com/UD2om.png) 

Usually, a normal person would reload the game or even start a new one. But no, not this time. I now felt something that I can only describe as furious anger and I only had revenge in my mind. How could they possibly fire their star manager after his first bad run in over 40 matches???

I decided to plot my revenge. The first big team that would hire me would be used to exact my revenge. A few Serie A managers got sacked, but they only laughed at my interest. Even Serie B teams weren't interested in hiring the manager that took a team from relegation battlers to European stardom in just one season.

After a year I got the message. I wasn't worth any decent team's time despite [santoscrew becoming the Serie A Manager of the Year, succeeding José Mourinho as the best manager in the whole of Italy](http://i.imgur.com/J0RHo.png). It surely had something to do with the corrupt ways of the Italian football in which I refused to partake and this was how they were letting me know.

I decided that I really needed to get back in the game. All teams are good enough for me now. Yes, [even Cynthia](http://i.imgur.com/WnIpZ.png). 

Cynthia isn't your regular Football Manager team. For instance, when I started out at Cynthia there were just [the chairman and me.](http://i.imgur.com/QL2Mt.png) As the newly promoted team in the [Serie C2/B](http://i.imgur.com/hbnnR.png), Cynthia's objective was to battle brave against relegation. Hardworking players like [Angelo Fratini](http://i.imgur.com/wRrTf.png) were asked to achieve this almost impossible goal. Enter santoscrew. ""He will help us not relegate to the Serie D!!"", one of the fans in The Communale 'A' said. Sadly, santoscrew, the once so succesful manager, [failed to deliver.](http://i.imgur.com/O8Mho.png) 

(In this game you get sacked when you relegate to a lower division that isn't loaded/isn't available in the game)

After becoming a raging alcoholic I got into rehab and pulled myself together. Revenge on Atalanta must be had somehow. But now, I'm even deeper then when I started at Cynthia. With the help of some close friends I finally found a way in. On December 15th 2104 [Paganese](http://i.imgur.com/e46XV.png) offered me a job. Paganese were at the time [hiding somewhere in the Serie C2/B midtable](http://i.imgur.com/gv07F.png), the same league in which santoscrew's Cynthia just got relegated from. 

After assessing my squad I noticed morale was low. So I arranged a friendly match with reserves to get that much needed morale boost. [Ouch...](http://i.imgur.com/niCkh.png) That didn't help much. At least I knew now which players I had to sell and where I needed better players. The season ended [pretty much the same as I started](http://i.imgur.com/2rrcm.png). 

On the other side of the galaxy a true miracle happened. [Atalanta won the Serie A](http://i.imgur.com/ElOmg.png). This was, of course, in no way related to the [foundation](http://i.imgur.com/XrJla.png) one santoscrew once put in place. 

The new season started [really well](http://i.imgur.com/l0PTA.png), with new signings like [Francesco Vivaqua](http://i.imgur.com/1gS1C.png) being the star of the team so far. Here is a screenshot of this Italian Stallion scoring a [hat-trick](http://i.imgur.com/uS5LP.png) in under 20 minutes.

Back to Atalanta for a moment, where some guy named Gasperini was named Italian Serie A [Manager of the Year](http://i.imgur.com/7HQeB.png). (this shit makes me sick...)

In that same season Paganese [won the Serie C2/B](http://i.imgur.com/SqBNX.png). Now on to bigger things. Things like the prestigious [Serie C2 Super Cup](http://i.imgur.com/G14ma.png).

Here are a few of the Paganese Stars this season: [Francesco Vivacqua](http://i.imgur.com/GQXOI.png), [Fabrizio Foresta](http://i.imgur.com/4mFoo.png), [Mehdi Joachim](http://i.imgur.com/e4DxA.png) and [Robert Stillo](http://i.imgur.com/qxRr1.png). And here [the winning formula](http://i.imgur.com/JLcPN.png). And, once again, [santoscrew winning a Manager of the year award](http://i.imgur.com/PFcmF.png). 

The Serie C1/B starts, with new signings like [Ralph van Campenhout](http://i.imgur.com/UpbJa.png) and stupid crazy matches that went like [this one](http://i.imgur.com/eRlyJ.png). Paganese were [doing good](http://i.imgur.com/Cf7RS.png), trying to go for a back-to back promotion. The feared [mid-season](http://i.imgur.com/5tPzX.png) crisis [started](http://i.imgur.com/5NUQ6.png), but a good manager always knows [what to do](http://i.imgur.com/P5T2y.png). Yes!!! And after that a friendly against the U20's... [Oh God not again!!!!](http://i.imgur.com/zjbUd.png). No back-to-back [this year](http://i.imgur.com/m632f.png).

At least Atalanta [is doing well](http://i.imgur.com/fBFWj.png) (wtf!!!)

The new season (2016/2017) [started well](http://i.imgur.com/POViE.png), with some big wins ([notice the 1-0 vs Deportivo!!!](http://i.imgur.com/orqhy.png)).

(In the meanwhile, a Novara striker pulls a [Torres](http://i.imgur.com/iFcFE.png))

My superstriker [Fabinho](http://i.imgur.com/wOlJ8.png) couldn't be kept and signs with a Serie B team. Same goes for [van Campenhout](http://i.imgur.com/c6nAX.png).

We finish in a [playoff place](http://i.imgur.com/O40ih.png). After winning the semi-finals [against Ascoli](http://i.imgur.com/31Yh2.png) we [beat Taranto](http://i.imgur.com/2VRo8.png) 2-1 for promotion. Paganese get promoted, Taranto manager [gets the sack](http://i.imgur.com/mn5mC.png), and santoscrew wins [the Serie C1/B Manager of the Year](http://i.imgur.com/EDohQ.png). Everything is going according to plan.

[The new season starts](http://i.imgur.com/yZmwe.png). Notice Juve Stabia relegating from the Serie A, I will get to them later. 

[The generous board is giving me lots of options](http://i.imgur.com/QCEsX.png). I am supposed to defend my team against [this](http://i.imgur.com/QH0At.png). 

(Here is the [Cynthia crest](http://i.imgur.com/giDr6.png). I just downloaded a crest patch.)

My assistent manager, since a few days after I joined the club, Cristiano Zanetti, [sarcastically points out that our youth development is shit](http://i.imgur.com/AbCzE.png).

Atalanta arranged a friendly match, [just to show me how far I still am](http://i.imgur.com/PQKh5.png). This [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/CnTIc.png) also hurts a bit.

The season doesn't start [too well](http://i.imgur.com/8rTfG.png), but new signings like [Paolo Cavalleri](http://i.imgur.com/Ty52Z.png) and [Olegs Riherts](http://i.imgur.com/KxEa3.png) really turn things [around](http://i.imgur.com/syEEX.png). 

([Thanks Mladenov!](http://i.imgur.com/0gB1g.png))

[My new formation](http://i.imgur.com/SS5hT.png).

OK. Back to Juve Stabia now. I noticed in the [Club Information page](http://i.imgur.com/Wr7xr.png) that we are fierce rivals with Juve Stabia, the club who just got relegated from the Serie A. My research on the internet proved to be really enjoyable! Juve Stabia is a club from [Castellammare di Stabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castellammare_di_Stabia). Not very far from Pagani. That must be the reason we are fierce rivals, right? WRONG!!! Check out this [piece](http://i.imgur.com/46NX2.png) from the Castellammare di Stabia wiki page.

That's right, the Stabia Mayor banned miniskirts, sunbathing and Football in public places. That's everything we here at Pagani stand for!!! And as a finishing touch, he went on and banned blasphemy (wtf!) and [clogs](http://i.imgur.com/sBQRe.png)(Probably because I'm a manager from the Netherlands). It was only right that we [beat](http://i.imgur.com/WTkh8.png) them, we do represent all that is fun in this world, [and we did it for the fans](http://i.imgur.com/fWOoF.png).

[Marcelo Torre only has places for 4602 fans](http://i.imgur.com/QVsjO.png). 

Paganese had a great run a the end of the season and [finished 3rd](http://i.imgur.com/rC22R.png). Time for playoffs. Semi-finals ended in a [2-2 win](http://i.imgur.com/0uJ1S.png). In the Serie B if both matches end with the same result, the higher seeded team goes through (lucky me!). 

The final 2 matches. Up against Cesena and [most of my players are on international duty](http://i.imgur.com/iaoHQ.png) (lots of U21). Compare that to [Cesena's squad](http://i.imgur.com/zflq8.png). Unfair! First match ends [2-1](http://i.imgur.com/L24Gi.png) in my opponents favor. 

The return ended in [2-1](http://i.imgur.com/QD70l.png) in my favor. Extra time (the seeded rule didn't apply here!). It was an extra time which showed Atalanta's hidden powers as Cesena scored a questionable goal and [I got denied a penalty](http://i.imgur.com/TEB9w.png): [3-4](http://i.imgur.com/9tp9A.png).

Failing to secure promotion due to a goal in the 115th minute hurts, but it was a succesful season still. [I'm gonna miss our captain](http://i.imgur.com/BJZdt.png) next season. 

(Real Madrid's [Alpha Peeters](http://i.imgur.com/XifLX.png).)

Made it back to the Serie A. The year is 2020. The time for revenge has come. The first match against [Atalanta didn't go that well](http://i.imgur.com/XC1MT.png) altough I'm [ahead of them.](http://i.imgur.com/zXBpk.png). Didn't make it [in the end](http://i.imgur.com/Rq7VJ.png).

Here is where it turns.

It all starts with [me stating our ambitions](http://i.imgur.com/Y8YbT.png). This was quickly followed by Paganese beating Atalanta [8-1](http://i.imgur.com/tqhmU.png) in the glorious Paganese Stadium, [Angel Di Maria getting sacked](http://i.imgur.com/iLpJm.png) and
Paganese [making a streak](http://i.imgur.com/M5B00.png) which ends with [Paganese winning the Serie A](http://i.imgur.com/Lfln4.png). 

Past winners show how [powerful](http://i.imgur.com/vd3aS.png) Atalanta was in the previous years. [This screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/WdYQz.png) shows Paganese's rise through the divisions and the capacity of the new stadium. It would be cool if it was called Stadio Paganese or Paganese Colosseum or something else instead of the English 'Stadium'.

Here are Paganese's [previous encounters](http://i.imgur.com/1pp8o.png) with Atalanta.

My star players were Goalkeeper [Dan Hulls](http://i.imgur.com/FJkSF.png) and Attacking Midfielder [Enrico Ricci](http://i.imgur.com/qjBYG.png). Captain [Emanuele Fontanarosa](http://i.imgur.com/ySRoL.png) and Vice Captain [Dmytro Kolesov](http://i.imgur.com/IH206.png). Wonderkid strikers [Fubá](http://i.imgur.com/yorb5.png) and [Paulinho](http://i.imgur.com/eDeKc.png) and my best Defensive Midfielder [Drazen Dzaya](http://i.imgur.com/U7r0V.png). Can't ofcourse forget my [longest serving](http://i.imgur.com/CPPxj.png) player [Lennard Inia](http://i.imgur.com/RZRc8.png). [The formation](http://i.imgur.com/9d3Ct.png).

It took [legendary manager santoscrew](http://i.imgur.com/sOCOL.png) 12 years, 6 months and 9 days ([from November 8th 2012 to May 17th 2025](http://i.imgur.com/sf3A5.png)) to get his revenge!"	t5_2s0w5	True

There are a few types of threads that keep popping up that just aren’t that interesting, IMO. Many of those threads have about 1-4 comments, so it seems I’m not alone in thinking this way. For example, I understand that you’re proud of winning the Champions League, or of finally beating that big club, but you have to keep in mind that those kind of threads are of limited interest to others. Therefore I’ve written up some suggestions on how we can improve things, by going through a few common topics. Of course I’m hoping to hear what you think about all this in the comments.

- Match results.

You can make these threads interesting for others if you include some more information. It’s great that you hammered Barcelona, but how did it happen? Did you (brilliantly) make a tactical change before/during the match, or were you just ‘lucky’ that your usual tactic worked? What kind of team-talk did you use? What enabled the goals to happen, or why did you concede?

- Competition results.

More or less as above. You should describe how the competition went, and go into some detail about the key games. Did you make any key signings? What tactic(s) did you use?

- Showing your regen/player/signing.

Just showing an attribute screen or news item is completely uninteresting, in my opinion. Tell us a bit more about the player! How are you planning to use him in your system? What do you think he will add to your team? Will you be changing your tactics to fit him in? What is his history like? (For young players) how will you make sure he develops fully?

- Help with tactics.

I’ve recently seen some threads like “I can’t score enough”, “I keep conceding” or “my away form is terrible”; without much more information. I’m sure most of us here like to help out with these sort of things, but you have to give us something to work with! Show the formation and the tactics screen! You’re the only one who watches the matches, so you have to tell us where the problem originates, so we can suggest solutions. E.g. are the players making individual mistakes? Is someone constantly being outpaced/outjumped? Are your defenders being outnumbered? Do your forwards keep trying ridiculous long shots? Do you find it impossible to keep possession?

- Tactics.

I’m not seeing many threads about tactics, and I’d like to see a lot more! I think it would be interesting to have discussions on topics like: playing without a striker, using a sweeper, using inverted wingers, maximizing possession, using playmakers, replicating Man City’s IRL tactics, playing ‘anti-football’, etc. etc.

- Funny pictures or videos. 

I think there's often too many of them, and they aren't always good. Correct me if I’m wrong here, but I’ve got the impression that the reddit system doesn’t really allow for long-term threads that we can keep coming back to (as it'll slip down the pages); therefore I can’t think of a realistic solution. I do occasionally enjoy those threads, so I don’t really want to suggest that we ban them. 

TL;DR I'd like to see more effort put into threads."	t5_2s0w5	True

I'm pretty excited today as I just finished up my third English hero, from Blue Square North/South up to the premier league and I don't know anyone who plays so I thought I'd share with you guys.

[About a year ago I asked for my next team](http://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/ynz27/help_me_choose_my_next_english_hero_team_in_the). I didn't end up taking any of the listed, but one who was just as bad size/finance/squad. I chose [Cambridge C](http://i.imgur.com/Vwr9EK1.png). They were promoted into BSN sixes years prior with the highest finish in those six years being 14th place. The year prior to my take over they finished 18th.

I started very slow... *very slow*. Given my budget, legacy players and trying to get a feel of the team. I struggled and clawed my way through that year trying not to get relegated. Hoping for draws rather than wins, knowing I could at least do that. On my final game in the season I needed two teams to lose and for me to win my game (having only won seven prior.) Somehow [they both lost](http://i.imgur.com/OkArRJi.png) and I rallied for the win to [finished 19th in the league](http://i.imgur.com/UB1gxTy.png), one above relegation. 

Some how, like a women with low standards, Cambridge C kept me despite my poor finish. The next year I was able to cut some of fat and start build my own squad with my tiny budget finishing 7th. After my second year, I was able to have a team made up virtually all of my own players, and use more of my attacking tactics.

I finished an agonizing 2nd in consecutive years, in [2074 losing by goal difference](http://i.imgur.com/WVSJwEv.png) and [2075 losing by one point](http://i.imgur.com/iNE5G8D.png). In each year I did my best [Cowboys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys) impression losing in the playoffs and not being promoted. (Am I allow to make American Football jokes here?)

Finally, and decisively we were [promoted to BSP in 2076](http://i.imgur.com/lKYL4Hk.png) with having nineteen points over the closest team. Won the [BSP first year in](http://i.imgur.com/Y8dg7DQ.png) and kept moving forward. League 2 continued the tradition as [I won that league](http://i.imgur.com/PHemrtk.png) as well in the first year I was in it.

The next year (2079), the momentum carried my team in [League1 finishing in 3rd](http://i.imgur.com/bzEe23S.png) (only 4 points back from 1st). Fortunately this time around we did not choke in the playoffs and were promoted into the Championship league. The following year (2080) in the Championship league we had a crazy hot start and thought we were going to win the league, but crumbled late in the season to [falling to a 5th placed finish](http://i.imgur.com/zHYfahc.png). Luckily we won promotion into the Premier league through the playoffs. 

Now late 2080, nine years after I took over Cambridge C... eight years after finishing 19th in BSN. I've made it to the premier league. Though I don't count it a true English Hero until I win the premier league. Full of gusto, ready to win the premier league first year with my spirited squad.... *I previously [won the premier league first year in](http://i.imgur.com/wyvXGzo.png) (somehow) with my previous english hero team Chester.*

Season starts and season ends and my first year in premier... [we are relegated finishing in 18th](http://i.imgur.com/L2CY1sq.png) place. Fortunately I was not fired, but told if I didn't get promoted back into the premier league the next year I would be fired. Back in championship league we dominate with the money influx that happened from the previous season and back we [go back to the premier league](http://i.imgur.com/C0Va0S9.png).  

First year back, have a better game plan, better players and [finish 9th](http://i.imgur.com/PquvdEd.png). Second season we [finished 2nd](http://i.imgur.com/IOBz7rh.png) (though I was in first, but lost my second to last game of the season... was so brutal). My third season we [finished a close 3rd](http://i.imgur.com/BgNdO6P.png).

Finally in 2086, fifteen years after taking control of this team we [won the Premier league](http://i.imgur.com/fClA574.png). Started off terrible, was in 15th place a quarter of the way in the season. Knew I had to finish strong, revised my tactics and over the second half of the season 15-1-3 to win the Premier league by one point! Also won the FA Cup this year as well.

**Possibly Interesting Facts/Lore from my Game World**


&gt;*Arsenal v Sutton Utd History*

* Arsenal dominated the Premier League until my first EH team (Sutton Utd) rivaled it. The value of Arsenal was well over [1,000,000,000,000 (1 billion dollars)](http://i.imgur.com/h7X7U6C.png) with the closest team Barcelona being about half that. 
* Arsenal was usually the closest competition we had when I coached sutton in the premier league and I considered to be our biggest rival.
* When I resigned in 2047 after twelve premier league championships, I left behind a great youth core and my play style caused my team to have high skill in DC/MC/S
* Despite this, the coach hired after my retirement went 8-5-3 before being fired in December. 
* Maxx Neumann was an wingback with Sutton over most his career, was a very good player, but never won any major awards. Neumann took over mid-season after the firing and took advantage at the strange depth of my team running a 4-2-4. Yes.... 4-2-4 all the time. 
* He had great, great success with this. In his seventeen years coaching Sutton he won the premier league eight times, Champions Cup 3 times, Euro cup once and FA cup four times. About ten years into his head coaching career they decide to build a new stadium with a capacity of 92,369. They call it Neumann Park... that’s right they named the park after him while he was coaching the team at the park.
* Seven years later, while under contract with Sutton Utd... and a park named after him (two years still on his contract) his contract is bought out he moves to Arsenal with about two million dollars being paid to Sutton for the transfer of staff. 
* When coaching for Arsenal he did not find nearly the same success with his 4-2-4 formation finishing 7th in both years he coached for them. He was fired after the second season. For context, in the previous 14 seasons Arsenal finished *out* of top five spots only once. Usually finishing in the top three.
* He coached against his former team at the field named after him twice and lost both times. Apparently having the naming advantages is not as good as home field advantage.
* After Neumann was fired from coaching Arsenal, Arsenal could never get back to it’s former glory despite being the wealthiest club in the world. Finishing in the top 3 only once in the last eighteen seasons. 
* It got so bad that Arsenal was relegated in 2079, but was promoted back into the premier league the next year. They are still a very rich club, being the second richest club in England and 4th in the world. Though they are now only valued at 453,000,000 (453 million) down over half from where they once were and the quality of the club has gone down as well. In the last five years the highest they’ve gotten on the table is 8th.
* Neumann’s [ranking](http://i.imgur.com/nVBrWgh.png) on the World Head Coaches

&gt;*Chester*

* Found success nine times under my second coach (Derek Sutton Jr.) but has struggled to achieve anything since my departure. They did tie for 1st two years after my departure  (losing by goal difference), but since this has been a mid-table team since and has increasingly been sinking closer to relegation finishing the last year seasons: 15th - 2086, 15th - 2085, 13 - 2084.
* Similar to Sutton, there was an attempted to get former world class player, Elliot Hunt, but he lasted for only 1.5 seasons and finishing 11th - 2083, and 13th 2084.
* They’re currently on their 18th head coach in the last fifteen years.

&gt;*Cambridge C*

* My top Goal scorer this year was one of my Wonderkid DC who’s 20. Most of his goals were scored on corners and about 5 or 6 from free kicks.

&gt;*Computer English Heroes*

* I’m going to stretch the use of English Hero to be any Semi-Pro english team to get into the premier league. There have been four.
* York City - Started in BSP - Was in the Premier League (81/82 - 82/83)
* Thurrock - Started in  BSS - Was in the Premier League  (81/82)
* AFC Wimbledon - Started in BSP - Was in the Premier League (46/47) (51/52) (54/55 - 55/56) (57/58 - 60/61) (62/63 - 66/67) (68/69 - 73/74)
* Luton - BSP - (43/44)

&gt;*Reverse Heroes*

These are teams who started in the Premier league in the 09/10 season who are now not in Premier (for the sake of ease, I’m going to exclude teams currently in CH)

* Birmingham - League 1 (low mid)
* Aston Villa - CH (low)
* Burnley - L1 (mid)
* Wigan - BSP (low)
* Portsmouth - L2 (low)

&gt;*Cups*

* FA cup has been won once by a Non-Premier team in 2040 - Newcastle
* League Cup has been won once by a  Non-Premier team in 2076 - Leicester City - 2076

1376682575.0	1kiaho	Morgan Schneiderlin is a cunt. [Rant] (Southampton 2017)	Hazelarc	73	7	27	"I'm taking a break from my 2045 Leverkusen save so I decided to start a new career with Inter. Unfortunately, they quickly decided I wasn't the right manager for the job, and sacked me in March 2013. Two weeks later, a struggling Southampton side languishing in 20th hired me to drag them out of trouble. Here's where the drama starts. 

I managed to drag Southampton to a 13th placed finish that first season (and an FA cup) and immediately went about transforming my squad. I got rid of the dead weight, signed a few promising regens, and started giving my young players spots in my starting 11 since my second season expectation was just to avoid relegation. After peaking at 5th, I finished the 13/14 season in 9th and got a big cut of prize and tv money. I used that money to sign Younes Belhanda, Dani Carvajal, and Sokratis Papastathapolous. I skimmed Nathaniel Clyne and both my keepers from my books and used that money to buy Sergio Romero from Sampdoria.

In the 14/15 season I massively overachieved, finishing an impressive 3rd and qualifying for the Champions League ahead of Chelsea, Tottenham, and Arsenal. This is when I heard my first complaint from the previously mentioned French cunt. He felt he needed to move to a club more fitting of his quality, so I promised him that we would qualify for the Europa league the next season and he seemed satisfied enough. That offseason, using the massive influx of cash and boost in my reputation (cash reserves made larger by the sales of James Ward-Prowse for 30 million and Gaston Ramirez for 32 million), I scored a massive coup and signed Erik Lamela from Roma and Kyriakos Papadapolous from Inter (where I had already previously signed him in my first window at Inter). I also saw four of my signed regens blossom into starters and two of them into world superstars. 

With my overhauled squad and some clever tactics I achieved the impossible in 15/16, winning both the Premier League and Champions League. I was hailed as a hero at St Mary's but Le Cunt was far from satisfied. He demanded a transfer just three weeks after our triumph over Manchester United in the Champions League Final. I rejected his demand as he was the lynchpin of my midfield and my captain. I figured with another impressive season he would be sated.

But it was not to be. Despite my signings of Marc-Andre Ter Stegen, Mesut Ozil, and Marouane Fellaini, and a third placed standing at the New Year, on January 12th, 2017, Mad Morgan demanded a transfer and went to the press to slate my ambition as a manager. I gave into his request and immediately stripped him of his captaincy, which caused him to again go to the press about my incompetencies as a manager. Two days later I sold him to Barcelona for 25 million. 

In short, Morgan Schneiderlin is a massive, massive cunt"	t5_2s0w5	True

Salary was a bit high, but right back was a huge problem for me last year, and he's available for only $80,000.

Signed.  Great coupe for the club.  Can't register him.  Keeps saying he is unavailable for the next match.  No idea why.  Finally notice, under suspensions, says he cannot play club football until  2/3/2013.  Think that's odd.

Go on google.  Google Mr. Thomson.  MFW I find out he is suspended for sending dick pics and asking for sex from a 12 and 14 year old girl, and placed on the national sex offender register.

Now I have $175,000 per year sitting in my reserves (big chuck of change for MLS) and no one to take him off my hands.

_____________________________________________________________

All the players submitted to this thread will be tracked and observed over the next 20 years in game, or until all of you retire. You'll start of as a budding, spirited 16 year old free agent hoping to make it big in the world of football. Some of you will make it big and go on to be the next Lionel Messi, Gianluigi Buffon or Rio Ferdinand however some of you won't. I'm sure you'll all secure a place footballing history whether that scoring a late winner in the 2022 World Cup Final or making the save that keeps your club from relegation!

_____________________________________________________________

Now that's over with let me basically tell you about some things that will happen in the project and provide you with the template.

.1.  Updates will be every July with updates as who moved where, who scored the most etc.

.2. I've also decided to change to the potential to be anywhere in the range of 120-200 (with one person definitely being 200 potential) to add more diversity. I will be using Random.org to determine peoples potential and I'll be choosing one lucky person to have 200 potential. (So look your prettiest)

.3. With every update we will be looking at:

* Who is the most valuable 

* Who is the biggest earner

* Who as the best average rating 

* (any more suggestions for what we can track would be appreciated)

.4. At the end of the project we will look at:

* Who had the biggest singular transfer fee

* Who had the biggest overall transfer fees

* Who scored the most goals in all competitions

* Who made the most assists in all competitions

* Who made the most appearances

* Who stayed at one club for the longest time

* Who played for the most clubs

* Best XI

* Who won the most trophies

If you have any questions or anything else don't be afraid to ask...good luck.

_____________________________________________________________

EDIT: Holy crap this blew up. It takes me about 3-5 minutes to create each player and I've got about 20 done so far. I'll probably be able to get them all finished by tomorrow and the first update probably won't be until tomorrow, BST/GMT that is.

EDIT 2: Jesus H. Christ there are tons of you hah. I guess this idea was pretty good one hehe. It might not be a day or two until I get the first update up because there is that many of you...sorry if things are slow at first, it's hard creating 50+ players haha wow.

EDIT 3: I still can't believe how many of you want to take part...hopefully I don't wake up to 500 more submissions. Anyway I'm going to set a dead line of:

Thursday 1st August at 12:00 (noon) BST

Thursday 1st August at 07:00 EDT

Now that the deadline has passed for getting your submissions in I just wanted to say that we got an absolutely enormous response (I'm still in disbelief at how well it went down). The thread itself has 200+ comments and a quick count up (not 100% sure yet) has revealed that we have 164 players...which is quite a lot.

Now because of the amount of submission that we've got, I've had to recruit a helper in /u/haxorjimduggan but it's still going to take us awhile to get all the players inputted into the database so I just wanted to tell you all that the first update might not be for a couple of days.

Another thing is that I've took the decision to do yearly updates only now due to the sheer amount of people wanting to take part as it would take too much time to do an update every couple of months so instead there will be updates every July.

Other than that, I can thank you all enough for the response that we got, I was expecting to get 5 maybe 10 submissions but we managed to get more than ten times that.

Thanks everybody"	t5_2s0w5	True

Thanks for the support you guys have given me. I hope to keep going with this database possibly throughout the summer. I don't know how long I'll be working on it this week with Finals coming up, but I'll try to get as much fine tuned stuff for the America Premier League done before I venture into the lower leagues.

Edit: 

So there seems to be a problem. Once you hit June 20th, the game crashes. I don't know what the issue is currently and if it is just me, but I will be working on it. Expect the v0.6 to not come out on Friday as scheduled. I will be making the next release v0.51 because of the issues currently revolving around the game. Sorry for the inconvenience.

I started off as my local club, AFC Stoneham, in the Hampshire Premier Football League Senior Division (level 12) and inherited pretty much nothing. I think I had £400 in the bank and this was my [best player](http://imgur.com/gJ1bV). Subsequently, after signing all of the new players, his coach/scout report went from 5 stars to half a blue star.

Straight away I was shocked at the relative high quality of players that would sign for me on an amateur contract (I think this is actually a bug in the English down to level 12 database as they just can't put reputation any lower) and so I signed a lot of players to fit with the 4-5-1 formation I usually play with a heavy emphasis on controlling possession and therefore the game. In the first few months I was able to bring in players like ex-Chelsea defender Billy Joe King, ex-Leicester striker Trevor Benjamin, ex-Celtic keeper James Gilpin, ex-Sunderland &amp; Hibs striker Fergus Bell and a brilliant Canadian left winger called Jake Ingis who previously played for Elgin City. The problem being with amateur contracts is that at any time these players can be signed by anyone who offers them a contract, so during the first season my players who were able to string any kind of form together were snapped up. [This was Fergus Bell's first season for me before being signed up](http://i.imgur.com/spDGa.png)

Despite these set backs I was easily able to win the league and get promoted as all the other teams in the league were signing players with attributes of around 5. I was even able to snap up an Australian under-21's winger called Joe Wright in the closing stages of the season who would become essential in the following seasons for me. All in all I think I signed 37 players that season.

Key players for the 2011-12 season:
*Fergus Bell (ST) - 23 apps, 24 goals, 11 assists
*Jake Inglis (AML/MC/DL) - 32 apps, 11 goals, 6 assists
*Charles Samushonga (MC) - 25 apps, 2 goals, 6 assists

Achievements:
*Champions of the Hampshire Premier Football League Senior Division and promotion from it.

I was offered a 1 year semi-professional contract at the start of the next season as AFC Stoneham became a semi-professional team after their promotion to Sydenhams Wessex Football League Division One and were finally able to offer contracts. I was able to tie down players who had rejected contracts elsewhere during the last season and sign a few big players including a 40 year old ex-Birmingham goalkeeper Ian Bennett and a fantastic striker called Graeme Eaglesham. Also, as trialists were able to play in league games I would keep signing players on 4 week trials and keep them for the whole season if their contract demands were too high, I did this with ex-Chelsea and Reading left back Thomas Lyskov.

The addition of contracts threw a spanner in the works early on because every month I would be losing a lot of money because attendances were still only in the 2 figures and each home game cost more than we got in return because of the groundskeeping cost etc. This made cup games essential because I was now entered into the FA Vase cup for the first time and the prize money would keep the club afloat. It was so important that I regularly rested my best players during league matches so they could play in the cup. It didn't seem to affect the league too much as I was comfortably top as I had a vastly superior squad to everyone else (a bug as I mentioned earlier I think).

With fresh players I was able to beat far better teams than me during an amazing cup run which eventually lead to winning the [FA Vase Final](http://i.imgur.com/EIilW.png). I also won the league comfortably and gained another promotion.

Key players for 2012-13 season:
*Joe Wright (AMR/L) - 42 apps, 16 goals, 27 assists
*Graeme Eaglesham (ST) - 38 apps, 40 goals, 11 assists
*Jake Inglis (AML/MC/DL) - 41 apps, 14 goals, 19 assists

Achievements:
*Club turned semi-pro.
*Sydenhams Wessex Football League Division One champions and promotion from it.
*FA Vase winners.

I started off the 2013-14 season by signing a 2 year contract with Stoneham and in the Sydenhams Wessex Football League Premier Division. The season started well yet again as I was able to strengthen my squad even more with the main additions being ex-West Ham centre back Sergio Sánchez, Thomas Lyskov signed permanently and ex-Middlesbrough attacking midfielder Jarrett Rivers.

This season did prove to be slightly challenging as we were entered into not only the league but the FA Trophy from the very beginning, the FA Cup from the very beginning and the FA Vase from the second round as defending champions. Games came very thick and fast during the whole season, at one point having [16 games in 2 months](http://i.imgur.com/1QTZL.png).

Unfortunately, finances were once again tight and I had to focus on cup games quite a lot. In the FA Trophy I was quite disappointing, I won the preliminary round but crashed out in the first round qualifying. In the FA cup I had a better time by winning my first 5 games in it and eventually being knocked out in the fourth round qualifying (when Blue Square Prem teams join and one stage away from the actual FA Cup). With the FA Vase, which started later, I made it a key priority seeing as I'd been knocked out of the other cups and was able to win it for the second time. Focusing on the FA Vase did affect my league form as I yo-yo'd between 1st and 2nd during the latter stages of the league but was able to pull away with a nice gap and win the league and yet another promotion.

Key players for the 2013-2014 season:
*Joe Wright (AMR/L) - 58 apps, 24 goals, 32 assists
*Graeme Eaglesham (ST) - 39 apps, 28 goals, 9 assists
*Connor Fitzpatrick (a young centre back signed in my first season who finally solidified his place in the first team because of injuries and huge amount of games) - 38 apps, 12 goals, 1 assist

Achievements:
*Champions of Sydenhams Wessex Football League Premier Division and yet another promotion.
*FA Trophy first round qualifying.
*FA Cup fourth round qualifying.
*FA Vase winners for the second year in a row.

The start of the 2014-15 season had me thinking whether or not I wanted to carry on with another season at Stoneham as I had become bored of always having the best squad and not too much of a challenge in the league and it would be too time consuming to make my way to a league which would be competitive to my team and by that time my squad would probably have become even stronger. Therefore, on the 5/6/2014 I resigned as Stoneham manager. I had gained them 3 league wins, 3 promotions and 2 FA Vase's in the 3 seasons I had been there and left them in a very good financial position and with a squad which could (and did) easily win the next league.

In my time at Stoneham I had been linked to many Blue Square North/South and Premier jobs and sure enough my search for a job only took a few months as I took over the reigns at a 20th place Mansfield in the Blue Square Premier on the 10th of October 2014 on a 1 year contract."	t5_2s0w5	True

**Part 3: Developing talent**

As in real life, no FM player can be guaranteed to reach their full potential. It can come down to a lack of work ethic, a personality problem, a mistake on your part, competition within your team or a slew of other things. This process takes several seasons so it’s important to remain patient as you develop your young players.

*****

*Infrastructure*

The foundation for a good academy is.. a good academy. Many things are a factor when it comes to your club’s youth intake.

* Staff: You should sort out your staff as soon as possible. Having good scouts and coaches goes a long way in finding and developing talent. In the Staff Responsibilities, have your best judge of potential be in charge of youth recruitment. As /u/thecrazymunchkin points out you should also your scouts having good Discipline and Determination helps as well as Adaptability to help scouts working in areas they're not familiar with.

And regarding match reports from scouts: 

&gt; Another thing that people might not realise; getting a standard scout report will get you the same hard data as making your scout watch a player. What scouting a player's match does is improve his understanding / opinion i.e. his CA/PA rating, his personality, and info on how receptive he and the club would be to a transfer. The knowledge on fees and wages that he might demand are sometimes a bit off, but they're generally pretty good guidelines, and are quite helpful when planning out a budget

* Youth Recruitment Network: The better your youth recruitment network, the bigger your talent pool and the better chance of a good young player coming through the ranks at your club. The reputation of your club plays a part in whether or not you attract the best talent in the area. I'm not sure if this is an actual phenomenon in the game but going by my intakes vs one of my friends' you may need to account for competition when it comes to your talent pool. For example, the chances of you getting a good intake as a club in London is probably lower than it is for a club in the north. At Hull, I have [no other Premier League clubs within a 100 mile radius apart from Huddersfield and the Manchester clubs](http://i.imgur.com/bYE1SC5.png) and got a few good players whereas my buddy at Leyton Orient never seemed to get good intakes, possibly from having to fight off Arsenal, Chelsea, West Ham, Tottenham and tens of other clubs. 

* Junior Coaching: A good junior coaching level will dictate how good the current ability (CA) of the players coming through in your intake are.

* Youth Facilities: Once you’ve sifted through the candidates and have offered them youth contracts, this will be important in how quickly your youth players fulfill their potential ability (PA).

Having all this in place gives you the best chance of getting a good intake.

*****
*Scouting*

Of course, even with all of that the chances of a truly exceptional player coming through your intake is still quite low unless you’re a club like Ajax or Barcelona who have such established academies. And like Ajax or Barcelona your own academy can get there but it will take time so if you’re impatient there is the far easier approach of scouting for young talent.

[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/1f30ff/new_manager_guide_part_1_setting_up/) covers a fair bit of your player search but I’ll add a few things that are specific to youth players.

* One thing that’s turned into a habit for me now is when your scouts give you their recommendations, quickly glance at it and if you see a player 20 years old or younger, have a look. Most of the time, they may not be anything special but once in a while you come across some amazing young players. 

If you aren’t sure of what kind of assignments to set for your scouting team the following can help:

* Send them to [areas that have been proven to produce great players](http://i.imgur.com/BkZGUOv.png) (i.e. Brazil, Argentina). *In Brazil, every young player gets a basic contract with a release clause under £1m so if you can wait until they’re 18, it’s a terrific source of talent. If you’re an up and coming club this may not be the best approach as by the time they join you, they may not suit your needs anymore.*

* [Scout youth competitions](http://i.imgur.com/FX0k20t.png) (i.e. NextGen Series, U18s leagues, U20s European/World/South American Championships). If you really want to immerse yourself into the game, you can attend these tournaments yourself and find players on your own. That way you can judge what kind of style they play and how they’d fit into your system.

* They say the cream rises to the top; look through [youth competition awards](http://i.imgur.com/EusvMgi.png) and you’ll always find some of the best youngsters in the world there.

* There’s a lot of smaller European clubs that produce great players on a regular basis like Sochaux or West Ham so go through their youth sides every once in a while.

*****
*Training*

As you start developing your young players you’ll need to focus on individual training to see the quickest improvement before a player is ready for first team football.

You’ll have to figure out where their weaknesses lie and what role you eventually want them to play. Should a player not be quick enough to fit into your system for example, it would be best to focus on that first. If he’s maybe only a little bit off the pace you could train him to an Individual Role if it also covers Quickness. 

A good way to find out what a player needs to work on is to decide what role you want him to play in the team. Once you pick an Individual Role to train a player the [attributes that are worked on in training will immediately be highlighted](http://i.imgur.com/6ZZ8TU7.png). You’ll need to use your judgement again and see what needs the most work. 

If you look at my player in the previous screenshot, you’ll see that his Technical and Physical Attributes are perfect for the role of Complete Forward. There’s no other areas where he has any glaring weakness so I can leave him on this training regime.

Looking at [one of my other young strikers](http://i.imgur.com/yzhjAIl.png) however, you can see many areas (I’ve left the important weaknesses highlighted) that need to be improved. I play with just one striker up front, so he needs to have the strength to hold up the ball and as his worst attribute I would work on that first. Once it’s at an acceptable level I’d figure out where he was with the rest of his attributes and train him on the next most important one for his role. You need to keep on top of it and move onto the next attribute as soon as you're happy with what you've worked on up to that point.

*Your players may be unhappy with a heavy workload but you shouldn’t change it unless they’re struggling for fitness. An intensive training regimen is the quickest way to improve their attributes.*

*Even though I haven’t really noticed it myself, a lot of people say that training a player to play a new position uses up PA. But if you feel he’s good enough for it to not have much of an effect then it can only help to have him play in a position best suited to his attributes.*

*****
*Tutoring*

A player might have great technical or physical abilities but it rarely comes to anything without the player also having the right mental attributes and personality. They come with experience and playing time but of course you want them to be at least somewhat ready for the rigours of the first team. 

Having your more experienced players tutor your youngsters is the best way to improve these mental attributes. The tutor’s personality could also rub off on your youth player resulting in him possibly working harder to improve in training and on the pitch.

Picking the right tutor is important though so once your players turn 23 (the age at which a player can start tutoring) keep a note of which of them would be ideal to help bring along your future stars. Here’s a few things to look out for:

* Personality: You want your tutor to have one of a Professional, Determined or Ambitious personality. There’s also lesser seen ones i.e. Model Citizen, Resolute, etc. that are [good personality traits](http://www.guidetofootballmanager.com/players/player-personalities#positive-personalities). 

* Mental Attributes: You want your tutor to have good Determination, ~~Work Rate and Teamwork attributes. In addition to that, you also want good attributes relative to their positions (eg. Concentration, Decisions, Anticipation, etc. for defenders).~~ You don’t want a defender that constantly makes mistakes tutoring a young player regardless of whether or not he has the ideal personality. ~~You also want to make sure that the tutor has higher attributes than your tutee in the important areas. The older player could have an adverse effect on the younger one if his stats are worse.~~ As /u/MisterMonacle points out and according to a lot of guides online, the tutor only affects the tutee's determination, personality and other hidden attributes, including loyalty, professionalism, etc. As per personal experience though I've often seen other stats affected positively and negatively during the tutoring period so, if possible, try to follow that if you're at a top team and have the resources to have the best players possible.

* Preferred Moves: You can also have your young player learn his tutor’s preferred moves. That can be done via the interaction that sets up the two players.

I’ll use my first team striker, [Maicol Musetti](http://i.imgur.com/f67jyPq.png), as a tutor here. He has a Spirited personality and his preferred move will come in handy (Runs With Ball Often). He also has the key mental attributes (Determination, Work Rate and Team Work) plus the right attributes for his position (Composure, Anticipation, Decisions, Off The Ball). He’s good Positioning away from being perfect to tutor a poacher. 

I’m going to pair him up with our U18s striker, [Augusto Sciutti](http://i.imgur.com/b9iLY8E.png), who will be playing in a similar role when he’s ready for the first team. He has an Ambitious personality and being a good dribbler I know that Musetti’s preferred move would work well. His mental attributes are in the right mould but need a fair bit of work anyway.

Once you think you have a good pair, interact with the tutor and under Development, choose Tutoring. You’ll get the option to pick the Tutee and usually the best match will show up at the top of the list. This is a good way to make sure that the two players won’t have a personality clash.

Asking the tutor to “improve [the tutee’s] game” could result in the youngster learning his preferred move. Asking him to “mentor [the tutee] off the pitch” will only work on mental attributes. Since I want Sciutti to learn to run with the ball often [I’ll choose the first option](http://i.imgur.com/UoAlyNq.png) and hope that he learns it.

*This is also a good way to improve squad harmony because if the tutoring process goes well the two players will have each other on their Favoured Personnel lists*

*****
*Playing time*

Even though you’ve spent all this time on training and tutoring, nothing can help a young player reach that next level more than first team experience. 

If you have nothing left to play for in the league then it’s a good opportunity to test out some of your brighter youngsters in low pressure matches. The league cup or early rounds of the domestic cups are also good chances to do it. Remember that pressure doesn’t help most young players so be encouraging in your team talks.

**Tip:** Use the [U18s filter on your Team Selection screen](http://i.imgur.com/41DjbSA.png) to select some of your youth players for first team games.

If you don’t think a player could get much time in the first team with you then offer him out on loan. When you have enough clubs in for him then you want to make sure you send him to a team that has good facilities. If that's not possible though, it’s ok. The playing time is what’s most important so if you get an offer from a club with poor facilities that are ready to offer him regular first team football in a league where he will be challenged, that’s fine.

**Tip:** If you’ve been at a club long enough, you get an option to select who you want as your feeder club. Choose a club with a established youth academy. I chose Southampton as mine knowing that they have the infrastructure to help me in developing my own players.

The whole process might end up in the player making his breakthrough at the club between two to four years, depending on the potential of the player. Players with a lot of potential get Wonderkid status and grow incredibly fast with first team football so keep an eye on that.

All in all, there's nothing more enjoyable than watching players you've had a direct hand in developing succeed whether at your club or somewhere else. Put all these things together and you'll have all of that."	t5_2s0w5	True

It would take a series of posts just to cover all there is to with FM tactics. And admittedly, I’m no expert with them so this will be more geared towards my preferred counter attacking football. For more in-depth stuff on tactics, there’s the [Official SI forums](http://community.sigames.com/forumdisplay.php/18-Tactics-amp-Training-Discussion) and tons of other forums and blogs online that cover it in great detail.

**Part 2: Preseason**

*****
*Team Instructions*

Now that I have my players, I’m going to work on the 4-3-3 I wanted to implement. As in real life, each league has a distinct playing style on FM so plan your tactics accordingly. I personally enjoy a direct, counter attacking approach and Italy is a great place to play such a style of football.

The Team Instructions look fairly basic but each change offers a lot on the pitch. I’d urge you to have a look at [Llama3’s Teams &amp; Tactics](http://www.theawaystand.co.uk/community/topic/6991-team-tactics-guide-released/) which covers a wide range of systems that have been used by real teams.

Also have a quick look at each instruction’s information window because I never really understood their true potential until I did. I’ll quickly run through [my own setup](http://i.imgur.com/PG1EZpL.png) to show you the complexity of these instructions.

Right away you’ll notice that I have two contradicting instructions: a rigid playing style with a lot of creative freedom. What this does is make my players drop deeper and hold their shape when defending. Then they have the freedom to exploit space as they see fit when exploding forward on the counter. This is why I have two defensive midfielders in central midfield. With the rigid style - and their own individual instructions which we’ll touch on soon - they’ll sit back but give us two extra players on the counter to overload the opposition defence.

The core of my tactic depends on the deep line. That along with the lack of closing down without an offside trap means that we’ll draw the opposition in. With the direct passing, quick tempo and low time wasting we’ll be able to transition into an attacking move with real pace and catch our opponents off guard.

Remember that everything ties in together. So for example, if you wanted to play Barcelona-esque football, you’ll want a more fluid style, with more pressure higher up with pitch with a high line, offside trap and more aggressive closing down. Without the latter two working in tandem with the high line you’d allow too much time and space to the opposition. And even though it only seems logical to give them creative freedom you may need to play with more discipline because there's a lot less room for error with such an adventurous tactic.

*****
*Player Instructions*

Having your players each have their own roles within the system is how you get the best out of them and the best out of your system. I’ll use my ball winner in midfield and one of my wingers to explain some of the intricacies of it.

With the [ball winner](http://i.imgur.com/yCRRbIp.png), the ultra defensive Mentality will mean that he’ll drop in front of the defence when the opposition are attacking. *You can use this for your forwards to make them move into an attacking midfield role and then get into the box late when going forward.* The way his Creative Freedom, Run With Ball, Hold Up Ball and Passing Style are set up ensures that once he does win the ball, he gets it out to the playmakers as soon as possible, setting us off on the counter without over-complicating it.

I could have put him in the DM slot and achieved a similar result but putting him in the central midfield role along with the Run From Deep instruction means that he moves further up the pitch when attacking. 

The options set for the [winger](http://i.imgur.com/OhXB6mW.png) are a little more straightforward. The setup of the Creative Freedom, Run With Ball, Wide Play and Roam From Position options means that when attacking he runs straight into the box. This benefits my wingbacks the most who will have open space to run into once the wingers draw the opposition fullbacks infield.

The default roles you can choose are great starting points but you should try and tweak them to suit your players. For example, I worked off the default DLP and DLF roles to create [Pirlo](http://i.imgur.com/LICz5Qp.png) and [Rooney](http://i.imgur.com/G3WFNlJ.png) style moulds which would undoubtedly bring out the best of both of them on the game.

*****
*Training*

Training in preseason doesn’t need to be as complex as it is during the rest of the year. At this stage, you need to focus your General Training to work mostly on Fitness, Team Cohesion and Tactics. Regardless of which one you choose, leave the intensity on Very High.

Fitness usually sorts itself out as you start playing games but if you notice your players struggling with it this should be first priority especially in places like England or France where fixture pileups can really stretch your squad thin.

If you don’t have to work on Fitness, you should spend most of preseason training Tactics when you get started. As you can see, [my squad is awkward with the formation](http://i.imgur.com/X5DOMRe.png) so we’ll need to get comfortable with it. 

As you start getting along in the game, you won’t really need to work on Tactics unless you’re implementing a new system. You'll have to work on Team Cohesion to help summer signings gel with the rest of the squad instead.

*Remember to bring the intensity down to High once your season starts. In the second half of the season, when your players start to get jaded you may need to bring it lower.*

*****
*Friendlies*

At the end of every season you’ll get a message in your inbox asking you how long you want your preseason to be. Five weeks is the best option here.

This should allow you to get in about 8-10 friendlies at three day intervals. Always leave a week between your last friendly and your first league match so that the squad can have a rest and go into the season fresh.

In your first season with a club, try to play teams at your level, preferably in your league so that you can see how your new tactic matches up to those around you. Once you have a system in place though, play local sides at the start of the season to get some easy wins while working on your players’ fitness. Then start ramping it up as you go along; you want to be playing similar or slightly bigger sides as you get towards the end of it.

**Trick:** If you’re in the lower leagues, you can get a decent amount of money if you play friendlies away at big clubs.

*****
*Fine Tuning*

It’s important to remember that early in preseason, results don’t matter. In fact, losses are better since you can spot and correct mistakes when the stakes are low. I highly suggest watching comprehensive highlights of your games in 2D mode so you can see how your team moves around the pitch.

Start your first friendly with the tactics you set out with and just watch. Don’t use any Shouts and don’t make any tactical changes or substitutions until later in preseason when you’re happy with your team’s shape. This way when you do make the changes in the next friendly, you can really see what kind of effect it has had. *If your team is struggling for fitness i.e. 70% and lower, then just focus on that for the first few matches until they’re fit enough to play a full 90 before you start working on your tactics.*

If your screen resolution is big enough, use the split screen with your 2D match and your Assistant Manager’s tactical feedback. If it isn't then just check on the feedback at halftime or if your team is struggling. Take a note of anything advice your assistant might have but remember not to make any changes. 

I lost my first friendly 2-1 but I did find an area of weakness in my team. We were getting bombarded down the wings because [my fullbacks weren’t coming out of defence](http://i.imgur.com/x0znmbD.png) and my wingers weren’t tracking back. 

For the next game, I moved my fullbacks’ Closing Down slider to towards the middle and changed my wingers’ mentality to something more defensive. I also saw my team being forced into [making far too many interceptions in the box](http://i.imgur.com/2WN82pp.png) so I moved my back line up. With us playing a higher line I brought down the aggressiveness of our tacking to keep players from over-committing too high up the pitch, leaving us exposed at the back.

Adjust your tactics as you see fit and again, no changes or substitutions for the second match.

This one ended 2-2 for me, with one of the opposition goals coming from a corner so I’m disregarding that while sorting out the tactic. 

The Analysis page is your best friend in preseason. Now that I have my two matches, one with the original and one with the changes, I can compare them to see just what an effect it’s had. [With the two pitches side by side](http://i.imgur.com/f6qqZ5D.png) you can see we played two columns higher in the second match leading us to spend more time in the final third. The higher line also meant [we missed fewer interceptions](http://i.imgur.com/iAAugCp.png) and more importantly, made more of them further up the pitch.

I’m not happy with how high up the pitch we’re winning the ball though because it doesn’t expose the opposition enough on the counter so I’m going to have to find some middle ground.

*It’s vital at this stage not to get frustrated. Despite using the same instructions for counter attacking football I’ve used throughout a very successful save, my team isn’t playing it as effectively on this one. Changing tactics halfway through preseason only means you have to start over with the tactical tweaking and you may not be ready for the start of the season so stick with your tactical philosophy.*

With my second set of changes - the “middle ground” - in place, I managed to win the next game, which was actually a cup fixture. We played better but using the Analysis page I can see over the course of the three games that we’ve misplaced far too many passes because of this direct approach. I'll bring the passing style back to Default for my next match and allow certain players to play more directly. And it goes on.

Now that you have the idea, continue this process until you’re happy with the way your team is playing. 

Your preseason might be a mixed bag but if you've been constantly tweaking you should see consistently good performances as you get closer to your first league fixture. By then you’ll have everything tuned to your liking and have your squad fully fit and raring to go for the long season ahead. 

**Tips:**

* Pitch size can be used to your advantage. The standard one is fine but I decided to go with a narrower pitch since I was struggling with my wide players not defending well enough. This means that things get much more congested and hopefully give me a better chance of keeping matches close. A wider pitch would give you more space to support a more calculated passing system. **EDIT:** Also a great point by /u/thecrazymunchkin 
&gt; Pitch size; one thing to note is that generally, the rule is that the better your team is, the larger you make the pitch. Even if you're playing a narrow formation, the larger pitch generally makes the AI spread out just a little more; your extra creative freedom here also means that your players might go for the gaps rather than sticking to formation. More space always benefits better players.

* When you get the message for your bonuses always go with the highest bonuses for all competitions. It cuts into your prize money, sure, but your team will be more motivated to get further in the league and cup meaning you get more of it anyway. You have to spend money to make money.

* People rely on Touchline Shouts a lot and sometimes it does really give your system a little more edge. I personally prefer to get my tactics to a point where I don't have to use them unless I'm in trouble. Whether you use them or not though, [it’s useful to know what each shout does](http://www.guidetofootballmanager.com/match-day/adapting-tactics/touchline-instructions).

During the exodus of manager from clubs that goes on at the end of every season, I thought of how it might be a better idea to have an actual interview for the jobs applied for.

It could be implemented in a vaguely similar format to the press conferences, but you'd also state your intentions(eg, philosophy, youth development, etc..) during the interview. You wouldnt be privy to any budgets until after the successful application. 

You could actually sit with the chairman(or managing director, director of football, whatever) and go through an interview of sorts, and hammer out various clauses in your own contract similar to those of a player.

Thoughts? Anyone? Bueller?

Just wanted to share another story to why I love this game series.

Meet Adriano Bracci: http://imgur.com/SCj6Z

Joined the club as a 16 year old, when we were in Serie C2, from an unknown amateur club: http://i.imgur.com/mcFdD.jpg

After helping the team to two straight promotions, he felt he could play at a higher level, and when a bid came in from a Serie A team, we couldn't say no - the money wiped out the clubs debts and helped buy the nucleus of a team that would get promoted to Serie A after two seasons.

After a successful first season in Serie A for my team, I was rewarded with a 12m budget and in the January window, Bracci returned to his beloved club. After a slow start, his 12 goals helped us secure 2nd place in Serie A. He was promptly made club captain for his efforts.

With a settled squad worthy of his level, Bracci went to work the next season, scoring goals like never before. His haul included five 4 goal games and 5 hat tricks.

With 6 games to go, we were 2 points ahead of Inter - they had at one point been 7 points ahead of us, but the combination of European games took it's toll (we got knocked out in the first round by eventual winners Man City) and we caught up. 

So, 6 must win games left and when the going gets tough... - Bracci scored 11 goals in those games, including the opening goal in 5 of them: http://i.imgur.com/mqw0z.jpg - the only game he didn't score was when we were playing bottom of the league Modena and he was rested.

In addition, why bother doing something if you don't do it in style:

Penultimate game, after we got a player sent off in the 30th minute (for diving of all things), we are playing 10 v 11. First Bracci earns and scores a penalty to make it 1-0, sets up 2-0 and finally, to finish it off: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZsDeqLueB8

Final game - after scoring 1-0 early on, he continues with this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU-f-iWRvlk - He went on to score 3 in an 8-0 win.

Funnily enough, he doesn't have 'lob keeper' preferred move, only 'likes to round keeper' (which he never does).

Final table: http://i.imgur.com/kVJWP.jpg

Bracci broke some records along the way: http://i.imgur.com/AwWoM.jpg - he is also the club record scorer, with his final goal of the season being the 100th league goal he scored for the club.

It's players and stories like this that make me love this game. Just wanted to share it with someone that understands!"	t5_2s0w5	True

______________________________________________
Hey everyone, welcome to next update of the TGPP, before we start I just thought I'd answer a couple of questions that I've been getting frequently since the first update.

* What skin do you use?

I use the [Scorpio Skin Ultimate by Dazs8](http://www.mypassion4footballmanager.com/2013/06/fm13-download-best-dark-skin-scorpio-ultimate-by-dazs8.html)

* Why doesn't my player have the stats that I wanted?

When we started, everybody's CA was set to 100 so your player may not have achieved that stat yet.

* How do you get the picture of the kit with the player's name behind their head?

Again it's my skin

* How long till the next update?

The May updates only take about 5 minutes to screenshot after simming so they will probably be a day after each September update. Whereas the September updates will probably be a day or two after each May update...if that makes sense.

* Can you link to the previous posts when you make a post?

I could but instead I'm going to create an Index thread where you can just click to any update from that one thread. The link will be here...once I create it.

Foreword: Before I start the first ever update of the TGPP I just wanted to firstly apologise if it's taken longer than everybody has expected as there was a lot of fiddling about to do with making sure every player was showing up and all that plus I'd also like to say a special thanks to /u/haxorjimduggan without whom this project would not be possible as he created more than half of the players to a superb standard whilst I was sorting out other things and also created and sent the game to me as I could only manage to load up half the players whereas he could load up all of them, so thank you.

Also, I will see if I can edit some Reddit regens at the end of the season to include some new intake!** 

*NOTE - This game is being played on Football Manager 2012, and therefore the database is a bit old. All accompanying pictures will be numbered in order. E.g. (1)*

**REDDIT FC**

After a sabbatical from the Premiership, I decided that now was the time for me to return to the game I love. There was a brand new team which had just won promotion to the Premier League. The club began to climb through the leagues from the lower divisions, and somewhere along the way, the club appointed a new chairman to oversee the development of the club. This man was David Parkinson, a successful businessman from the local area. 

It was common knowledge in the newspapers that I was on the look-out for a new role, with clubs such as West Ham and Fulham being thrown around. I was still undecided, but I wanted to make a decision within the next few weeks. 

Late one night, I received a call from Mr Parkinson. The club had a lot of potential, they had no debts, a modern stadium, and plenty of money from their recent promotion. However, their old manager had surprisingly quit the game in order to do media work for the BBC. He offered me a two-year contract worth £28,500 per week, and gave me until the next day to sleep on it. 

It wasn't the hardest decision in the world. 


**5 JULY 2011 - MORNING**

I arrived at Reddit FC in my battered old motor. I had been running low on money lately (I wasn't on the most lucrative contract at my previous club), but this bumper windfall was just what I needed. I made my way up to the Chairman's office, excited and nervous about the opportunity I had just been given. 

David welcomed me into his office, and we sat down to discuss business. He didn't waste any time, and stated that he felt we had the squad and the facilities to challenge for the Premiership title in a few years. I tried hard to disguise my shock, as there is surely a difference between ambition and insanity. 

I tried to manage his expectations, and I calmly stated that surely our first aim would be to secure our status as a Premier League club. 

He gave out a quiet chuckle, and laid out his minimum expectations for the season. My eyes nearly popped out of my head. ""I believe in the potential of this club, and I think we should at least be qualifying for the Europa League this season.""

With that, I agreed that I will do my best to achieve his objectives, shook his hand, and walked out of the boardroom calmly. I had an immense task on my hands. ([1](http://i.imgur.com/55QMxlA.png))


**5 JULY 2011 - AFTERNOON**

Unfortunately, the majority of the club's former staff left when the old manager retired. Therefore, I completely cleared out what was left of the backroom staff, and set about finding a new Assistant Manager, along with other crucial staff members. I needed all the help I could get if I was to meet the chairman's expectations. 

I knew that Brian McClair, a youth coach at Manchester United, had eyes on climbing the managerial ladder. He had been instrumental in moulding and coaching United's young players, and we had some very promising youth prospects. We had enough money to better the contract he had with the Red Devils, so I picked up the phone, and discussed terms. Brian informed me that he would let me know his decision soon. 

**6 JULY 2011 - MORNING**

I still hadn't heard from Brian, but I couldn't blame him for taking his time. He was one of Alex Ferguson's most valued staff, and I'm sure that it would be a very difficult decision for him to make. However, I couldn't spend the morning waiting for that call, as I had to attend my very first press conference as manager of Reddit FC. I took a quick glance in the mirror, and made my way to the press box. 

It was very much a paint-by-numbers conference. Not many questions, and none of them were too taxing. I'm sure it would get more difficult as the season went on. 

I made it clear that I would aim to entertain the fans, and underlined the fact that we had some great technicians at the club. I didn't explicitly say so, but I felt that we could play in a similar way to Barcelona or Arsenal. ([2](http://i.imgur.com/OlA0NZj.png))


**7 JULY 2011 - MORNING**

I was getting nervous. I still hadn't heard from Brian McClair, and I needed an objective report on my squad as soon as possible. I also had a superstition of getting an assistant in place before hiring any other staff. 

However, as I was sitting in my office browsing Reddit at 6:45am, my phone started to ring. ""Hi Dazzorifik"". It was Brian. I slumped back in my chair expecting the worst. ""Sorry I've taken so long to get back to you, but I was chatting it over with Alex. I'm sure you understand.""

If I knew Sir Alex, and I thought I did, he would be furious that I was trying to poach one of his key staff members. 

""Alex doesn't want to lose me, but he accepted that I was a good enough coach to become an assistant."" I sat up in my seat. ""I'd be delighted to accept your offer, I'm on my way to your club now.""

Although it would have been a bitter pill for Sir Alex to swallow, I was sure that the £1.4m compensation package for Brian's services would make things easier. 


**7 JULY 2011 - MORNING**

In just a mere two hours, Brian arrived at the club grounds. I decided to give him a couple of days to build a team report for me. In the meantime, I would set about building a top-quality backroom staff-base. 


**10 JULY 2011**

Before I could finalise my backroom staff, I glanced at the calendar and realised that we had a friendly with Dundee United. So, we bundled into the bus and headed to Scotland. I informed Brian McClair that I would be requesting a team report from him after the match. 

I still had no idea what my best team was, so I asked Brian to pick the team for this match. ([3](http://i.imgur.com/3OzfcC8.jpg))

I revealed the first XI in the away dressing room, but I made it clear that anyone who was not picked today would get their chance. 

I stated that people were playing for places, so the sole purpose of this match was to impress me. The squad didn't seem to react.....at all. I wasn't sure if that was a good or a bad sign. ([4](http://i.imgur.com/AEGrCBN.png))

We kicked off, and I could see straight away that we were a class apart. Leftyboy87 calmly slotted home after just 3 minutes. Then it goes from bad to worse after 5 minutes, when Dundee score an own goal. I'm sure they didn't need to make it any worse for themselves. 

After 12 minutes, things got even worse. Dundee conceded a dubious penalty. I had a policy of never choosing penalty-takers, instead prefering the most confident player to take the duties at the time. Our most experienced player, TehRhino grabbed the ball with intent. He placed it down, and calmly placed it in the bottom left corner of the net. 3-0, and Dundee were beginning to look like an amateur team. 

After Leftyboy87 scored his second after 15 minutes, I decided that I would nip off for an early pie, as it looked like we were having no trouble at all, with or without my help. 

I arrived back at the bench just before half-time, and we were 6-0 up. We weren't even breaking a sweat, so I decided to completely change the teams around. 

It was at this point that I discovered our second-choice GK Ariff, Malaysian No 1, was only 5""5. Cruel fate had pointed its cold finger, and Ariff had lost. He was an amazing shot-stopper, but I'm not sure if he could hold down a place if we were going to compete. He still had a chance to impress me though, I hadn't made my mind up yet. 

The second half passed by without incident....almost. We had scored three more goals, but Kevin was stationary on the touchline after 87 minutes. I didn't take any chances, and ordered him to be carried off the pitch. Andrew came on in his place. I hoped that the injury wasn't too serious, as I patted him on the back as he was stretchered into the tunnel. 

The match ended without further incident, and we had won the game 9-0. To say I was shocked would be an understatement. I expressed my delight to the team, and waited to hear from the physio. ([5](http://i.imgur.com/8NvKgSA.png))

Luckily, Kevin was just extremely tired after the match. I was quite concerned that he was so exhausted after just one half of football, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt. It was the first match of pre-season after all. 


**10 JULY 2011 - EVENING**

Soon after the match, the final piece of my backroom puzzle fell into place. I had always been a big fan of Martin Keown, and I managed to convince him to join our club as a first-team coach. After Keown signed on the dotted line, we finally had a decent set of staff to take on the Premier League. ([6](http://i.imgur.com/Uzhjx0D.png))

I walked into the chairman's office, and he congratulated me on a great win. I told him that the work was far from over, and we would face far tougher opposition when the season started for real. Before I left, I expressed concern that we had such a large squad, and I was concerned that we would not be able to develop them all to the best of our ability. The chairman agreed, and stated that he would work to find a top-quality feeder club for us to send players on loan. The chairman may be ambitious, but at least he's supporting me. 

I had a chat with Brian McClair, and I informed him that I would let him take control of our remaining friendly matches, as I felt that I had learnt enough about my players in the previous match. I also decided that I would call a team meeting just before the start of the season, as we had an intimidating maiden match in the best league in the world: Arsenal.

**TEAM CONTEXT**

Season 2019/20.

I've always managed a Romanian team on long-term in every Manager played, this game it's Rapid Bucharest. League champions since 2013, my European high was a Champions League semifinal in 2017/18, [played and lost against Arsenal on penalties](http://i.imgur.com/uWdsV.png), after knocking out Barcelona and United (an epic which I'll reference later on). As usual I forged my little army of young'uns season after season, had the satisfaction of seeing them play for strong national teams, seen some players close to my heart leave for greater fortunes ([this particular guy](http://i.imgur.com/aSXzw.png) was for two consecutive seasons the only regen nominated for the Golden Ball, and possibly my most cared for player in my recent years of Managers. [History](http://i.imgur.com/aj6S6.png)). 

A personal objective (apart from continental domination, of course) is to beat Steaua's 104-match unbeaten run in the domestic league, standing from the '80s. Before the start of the season the team was unbeaten for 19 domestic matches, and had 42 league matches with one loss, an away match against Dinamo (referenced [here](http://imgur.com/9ppV8). Dinamo is my personal nightmare, with more than one loss despite total domination. I fucking hate them.)

I'm also the manager of Romania since November 2015. Without any World Cup participation since 1998 and European Championship participation since 2008, game included, I was determined to make a mediocre team into a considerable adversary. First two years were decent, [finishing third in the World Cup qualifiers](http://i.imgur.com/siQHj.png) (despite drawing in Turkey and winning home. Why third? Because you're a better team only if you win with Kazakhstan 9-0 as opposed to 3-0. Fucking stupid.)

Since a qualification for the Euros is ridiculously easy from 2016 onwards, my satisfaction for 2020 would be limited, but I still had to guide a fledgling squad through matches with England, Greece and Hungary. With matches remaining against Liechtenstein, Greece and Hungary, I was one point above Hungary and two above the hellenes , who still had one match each against England. So far so good.

Standings: 19th place in coefficient rankings with Rapid, 12th place in coefficient rankings for Romania, 39th in world rankings with the Romanian team (rising from 60th in March 2019).

Ambitions for this season are high, determination is strong, the players are willing and the fans are yearning for succes. Let's get started.



**SEASON SUMMARY: FIRST HALF**

First challenge of the season: get [this bastard](http://i.imgur.com/PkiTg.png) to stay with the team. He ultimately went to the press to demand a move to a bigger club, but calmed him down for the moment by prosising the moon and stars with Rapid. Another reason to perform, since I'm not keen yet on selling the best keeper I've had (and cheap as well. Bought him three summers ago for 2M).

In Europe, drawn into a Champions League group with Lyon, Napoli and Vitesse. This will be tricky. Won the away match agains Vitesse before drawing home with Napoli. This was acceptable and cemented my place in the European spring. Then came the double against Lyon, 1-0 home and 1-1 away, which left me ecstatic. The last two matches, wins against Vitesse and Napoli, left me with my best performance and my first [top finish in the Champions League first stage](http://i.imgur.com/HIftq.png) since taking over Rapid. The last time this happened, in 2008 with Steaua, I won the tournament. At this point, I'm really looking forward to the knockout stages.

Inbetween the Champions League, a 2-0 win against Liechtenstein and a 0-0 draw in Greece (despite numerous shots and chances) left me only one point ahead of Hungary (who, in the meantime, had drawn 1-1 in England. Seriously..?) before going against them head-to-head at home. Since I had won in Hungary 4-2, I say that a celebratory thrasing is in order. 

This is the first point in the season where the game straight out says ""Fuck you, here's a challenge"". Hungary go 2-0 up before half-time, one of my former strikers scores his first two goals for the team. Luckily [I do manage to draw level](http://i.imgur.com/Ko2dM.png) in the 87th minute from a corner kick, and although celebrations were a bit spoiled, [I got through to the Euros!](http://i.imgur.com/DrM9m.png) Rejoyce!

How about the domestic league? [Won all 18 matches in the first half of the season](http://imgur.com/ZJokR.png), first time I've done this with Rapid. At that point I say ""Why not try and win all 34? Got one over Dinamo away, so there's less worry"". New objective.

After all, what can go wrong? The team's at its best since I'm in charge and the national team is finally shaping into a strong, united and competitive bunch. This is the time to achieve everything.

**SEASON SUMMARY: SECOND HALF**

So the Champions League. First place means a decent opponent up ahead, right? ""[LOL NOPE.](http://i.imgur.com/3YhaH.jpg) Here's Manchester City"". They were the holders and, before the first match, were twenty points ahead in the Premiership. [Well FUCK YOU GAME](http://i.imgur.com/KZZ7v.png). Here's the best win I've ever pulled with Rapid. I couldn't believe it.

Moreso when the game decides to still attempt to make me its bitch. I've taken all possible measures to avoid complacency - strongest starting eleven, press conferences and team talks - and by the 60th minute I trail 4-1. Horrible, horrible and unnatural defending. I tremble until the end, but [luckily the team pulls through.](http://i.imgur.com/lBMWP.png) First defeat in all official competitions after 47 matches. Damn you game, I will get the upper hand!

In the quarter-finals I'm drawn against Chelsea, and [lose the away match 2-0](http://i.imgur.com/K30bk.png). Now where have I seen this before?

Backtrack two years, I was facing Manchester United in the quarter-finals. I lose the away match 2-0. After some private talks and spot-on team talks, I get an [incredible 3-0 win](http://i.imgur.com/ljm9R.png). Now that's one of those unbelievable moments you can experience in a FM game. 

How about this year? Can I pull the same thing against Chelsea?

Well, half-time back home was 0-0, so not really. But that's not the end! Three goals in one half, and Hulk hitting the crossbar in the dying seconds. [The team has done it again!](http://i.imgur.com/hKq49.png) I'm completely elated!

And I'm drawn against Bayern Munchen. First match away [was lost 1-0](http://i.imgur.com/KSDbF.png). Well, I've done this before, let's try again. BUT WAIT! The game is still not through with me. It keeps its greatest tricks just before the end.

Inbetween the two Bayern matches, I play Steaua away. 6v24 shots, 3v12 shots on target, [2-2 final score](http://i.imgur.com/my7Ng.png). Outplayed them as never before, a draw as always. The first draw of the season in the domestic league and my 34-victory objective goes to waste. At least I'm still undefeated, it's now 48 matches unbeaten domestically, no need to fret. Almost halfway to 104.

In comes the return leg against Bayern. [Also lost 0-1](http://i.imgur.com/E9fHm.png). A ridiculous match, one to forget, since the team didn't play well at all. The fairytale ends here for this season.

And right then I'm back in the league, playing Dinamo at home. Half-time is 2-0, no worries. In the second half my defender is red-carded, then [this happens](http://i.imgur.com/qeMcU.png). The game pulls its greatest trick ever. I was boiling with rage on the inside. I was refraining myself from actually smashing something. I raged at my team in the press conference before storming out for the first time ever.

Four matches brought me from paradise to decent, then to rock-bottom, then to the Mariana Trench.



**EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP**

Going on holiday for the rest of the season with Rapid I make an effort to at least play the Euros with Romania and try to do my best with them. I was drawn against Italy (World Champions), Serbia and Montenegro. A fair chance at the eighth-finals. Romania was on a 12 match unbeaten run and 5 matches without conceding (both records for the game).

My first match is a [1-0 win over Serbia](http://i.imgur.com/tfYGZ.png). The second against Italy is quite an incredible one [and I win it 3-1](http://i.imgur.com/jr62r.png), I would have never expected that! Rounded up with a [2-0 over Montenegro](http://i.imgur.com/xDFOH.png) and Romania finished the group on first place. Considering that I was expecting to get 4 points or even 2 (Montenegro is not an easy team), this was just beautiful.

Of course, I'm not given a break and from all the possible teams that I could face after finishing top of the group with 9 points, I get England. For the record, the matches in the qualifying rounds ended in a 2-0 loss in England and a 2-2 draw home. After 90 minutes the score is 0-0. In just 15 minutes, Bus and Chipciu put me in front. Wilshere pulls one back, [but I get yet another superb victory.](http://i.imgur.com/PIGGL.png)

And I was not alone; France, Spain and Italy were also [knocked out in the second round](http://i.imgur.com/nhZVH.png). This is getting better and better. Next encounter in the quarterfinals is Turkey, France's executioner. I get my payback over them as well [with a 2-0 victory](http://i.imgur.com/Xk7KK.png), and wouldn't you know it! I'm in the semifinals! I'm drawn against Germany, the only team from the top five of Europe left in the tournament, but I don't intend to stop here, the side is playing superbly.

I've chipped in over the past couple weeks, but I haven't had time to construct a full post covering my thought processes behind how I design my tactics and plan for the future. I'll also go into a tiny bit of detail about squad building as well, seeing as tactics and player recruitment go hand in hand. Sit back; this is going to be long-winded and messy, but hopefully you'll find something interesting inside.

_____________________________________________________________________________________




**Setup**



My most recent save game is with Valencia, so I'll start there. As much as I love lower league management, it can be a bit of a break to give yourself a decent team with some options occasionally. I'm currently 3 seasons in, but I'll start a new game right now just so I can run through the squad as it was when I started. Playing on FM 12 (DB 12.2), but this'll be applicable to any FM post-2005.



_____________________________________________________________________________________



**The Squad**



First up, [here's](http://i.imgur.com/d5A8jcl.png) the assistant reports on the team, just so we get a vague idea of strengths / weaknesses. Things to note:

1. Far too many keepers. I tend to run 2 keepers in the first team rather than 3. Alves is my first choice, Guaita's my second, and the other 2 can be sent to Valencia Mestalla (effectively the reserves).

2. Defence: Victor Ruiz and Adil Rami are my clear starters; they're much better than anyone else. One thing to note is that 'recommendation' can be a bit misleading; it outputs the assistant's PA report. Handy for tracking youngsters; less useful for determining starters. Note that we're a tiny bit short at full back; Bruno in particular is a very average player, and I'd prefer to bring in a specialist right back to replace the aging Miguel.

3. Midfield: We're somewhat well stocked here. Ever Banega will be the player I base the whole team around, whereas Canales will be the main creator. (I'll explain all these decisions in a bit more detail later).

4. Up front, we're also slightly lacking for a team chasing 3rd. Soldado is clearly out best striker, and we'll have to hope he stays fit.

We've got a transfer budget of £5m, and a wage budget excess of ~£100k to work with.

**Tactics time**



The meat of the piece is here!
First things first; if you're new-ish to the series, you'll want to check your staff reports. Go to your inbox, click on [this](http://i.imgur.com/RDNwoiU.png). You'll get taken to [this](http://i.imgur.com/lV1xwIs.png), which gives us loads of info / suggestions. Feel free to use those as a base to experiment a bit with so it's a little less daunting.

On the tactics page, the easiest thing to do is to slot in the keeper. If we're sticking to the presets, we now have a choice to make; do we want a 'sweeper keeper', or a standard one? Essentially, this just determines how far they're prepared to come off their line, and how often they offer themselves as an option to pass back to when the defence is under pressure. The vast majority should be kept as standard, but if they've got high acceleration (to get off their line), concentration and composure, and are possibly two footed with a decent first touch, then you could give it a go. I'm just leaving him as standard here.



_____________________________________________________________________________________





**Next up, the defence**



 Here's a link to an [album](http://imgur.com/a/hUJ9T#0). Now, we can confirm that Ruiz / Rami is definitely our first choice pairing. Dealbert is a slow but competent 4th choice, while Ricardo Costa can come in and offer a more experienced option if Ruiz has a bad couple games. In general, I like to play players with as much passing ability in defence as possible, so Ruiz clearly gets the nod.

On to full backs: on the right, Miguel is still a great option. Pace / acceleration / stamina are some of the vital stats you need on the flanks, and I'll often sacrifice a bit of defensive ability for a player who's just physically better. On the other hand, Bruno is pretty much the definition of average full back at this level.

On the left, we have Mathieu and Alba. Mathieu's solid all round, whereas Jordi Alba's a bit more offensively minded. His tackling and marking is a little low, although again, I think that having the pace to stay with your man on the flanks and slow the play down is sometimes more important.

For a team chasing 3rd, we'll ignore the comedy 5 at the back option, so we need to choose between a back 3 and a back 4. Both have their advantages, but the problem with playing a back 3 (+ wingbacks) as our 1st choice formation for the whole season is that Miguel remains our only competent option on the right. So here, I've gone for a standard back 4, although the back 3 is a good option for a secondary tactic to bring out when the whole team is fresh.

As for roles / individual tweaks: I'd love to play a ball playing defender alongside a standard CB, but I don't feel that Ruiz's 13 in passing is good enough to justify this. Besides, as we'll get on to later, I tend to play at least one deep lying passing midfielder anyway, so this role is a bit redundant. As for the full backs, I've left both on support. I've left both of those on the default setting; I'll do the majority of my tweaking there with team instructions.



_____________________________________________________________________________________


**Strikers**



I know, I've skipped ahead a little. We'll go back to midfield later, as that's the most complicated section, but the choices up front are pretty easy. [Album](http://imgur.com/a/TnUGc)

They actually seem a bit better than what I remember, but to me, Soldado's the clear stand-out still. With only 3 strikers total, a 1-striker formation's my personal choice. I'll keep him as an advanced forward - I want him somewhat involved in the build-up rather than being a pure poacher. I'd be tempted to tweak him to shoot from range a bit more often, but the formation's going to be based around ball retention at this point, so we'll keep it standard again.





_____________________________________________________________________________________



**Midfield**



[Album link](http://imgur.com/a/Tlro5)

First things first; I always start by trying to maximise my best players. Banega is an obvious standout, as are Parejo and Canales. Personally, I prefer Canales to Parejo - he develops a bit better over time, but they're pretty similar players in how I intend to use them.

As I've said a few times now, I really like playing at least one defensive mid rather than a flat 4 in midfield. Also, seeing as we now know we're playing a back 4 and 1 up top, we can start to think about the formation as a whole. I really want Banega to be controlling the game from deep, while Canales offers a more incisive playmaking role linking with the striker. This suggests a 4-2-3-1 of some sort.

However, we notice that we've got an imbalance here. Hernandez is a pretty decent right winger, while Feghouli's not that bad either (he develops pretty nicely as well). However, on the left, our options are a bit limited. Armiche is terrible and should be binned off immediately, Bernat is way too raw (and doesn't develop that well), and Piatti is decent, but is way too easily shut out of games. To fix this, we need either a signing (though one that'll perform out of the gate is going to be difficult to find for ~5m...) or an idea. This is the first thing that I'll say which I've hardly ever seen anyone else comment on - formations don't *have* to be symmetrical. This is something that happens so much in actual football, but everybody in FM seems to prefer neat shapes (not that there's anything wrong with that most of the time). To give an obvious example, look at Barcelona ~2009 - 2011, where Dani Alves was a much more attacking option than Abidal on the left.

So to fix this, we can look back to our defence, and find Jordi Alba. He offers quite a lot of what Piatti offers - great pace, but he trades a little technical control for being better all round the pitch, and is, IMO, the much better option. However, instead of making him a pure winger, we'll drop him back to the 'LM' position and make him a defensive winger. Then, we can exploit Mathieu's decent attacking ability by going into player instructions and telling them to swap positions.

To combat this, we'll make a couple tweaks. We'll move Canales left a bit so he can hopefully utilise some of the space, while making Hernandez an inside forward rather than a pure winger. The thinking behind this is to hopefully draw the opposition defence towards our left, before playing in Hernandez behind the defence as he cuts in from the right.

The final position is a bit of a toss up. Against better teams, I tended to play Topal as an anchor man, with his purely defensive qualities, whereas against worse teams, I could play Maduro, whose better passing helped keep the ball. As an extra aggressive strategy, playing Costa in CM as a box to box midfielder running up the channel with Hernandez gives more threat from range, as well as the best set pieces in the squad.


_____________________________________________________________________________________




**Team Instructions**



Onto the home straight now!
4-2-3-1 in general suits a more fluid playstyle, especially in our case where we want players drifting in and out of position. Similarly, a possession based style means that we should choose control as our main strategy.

Normally, I'd expect to recommend a shorter passing style with a possession based game, but with Banega / Canales's accuracy, giving up that more direct option isn't necessarily the best thing to do. I've kept it on default for now, but bear in mind that one of the shouts in-game (retain possession iirc) directly changes this to short passing. This can be helpful if you're struggling to keep the ball, or just trying to see the game out.

Similarly with creative freedom, it's often better to tweak it on an individual basis rather than in the team menu. Default will do. Next is closing down; similarly, I've left it on default. If you want to, and if your offensive players have the stamina for it, it's sometimes useful to set it to that individually, but in particular, I like my DMs to stand off as much as possible. It reduces the possibility that a striker will beat him and then have a clear run at the defence; and IMO the idea behind playing a DM is to mop up loose balls and slow down an attack until the midfield can regroup.

The rest I've left on default, with the exception of more roaming (similar to creative freedom, although this is something we want to encourage throughout the team).

And we're [done](http://i.imgur.com/OxHi1Xl.jpg)! 

Bear in mind that Alba and Banega aren't naturals in their positions, so a bit of positional training won't go amiss. One final thing to note - this is by no means a definitive guide to 'how you should set up Valencia / any other team'. It's intended as a counter to the proliferation of tactics offered up for download as a general win button for the game. None of this is particularly difficult - this post has taken me an hour or so to blast out including all the fiddly screenshotting; it just boils down choices to their essences and takes things one step at a time.

This isn't even my final tactic - this is my best approximation to the very first iteration I started with on my save. The team / player instructions in particular changed a bit over the course of the season, as well as the one change that I did put in this post just because I found it quite interesting (dropping Piatti for Alba).

Hopefully this has helped some of you in terms of thinking exactly how to break things down when you first load into a save, and hasn't bored the rest of you too much. If anyone's got any tips that I should use for reddit formatting, I'd love any pointers (again, this is my very first post)."	t5_2s0w5	True

**The Tactics**

&gt;In Inverting The Pyramid, Jonathan Wilson explains how Arrigo Sacchi once demonstrated in a training session how five organised players could hold out against ten disorganised ones – taking his Milan back five of Galli, Tassotti, Costacurta, Baresi and Maldini and pitching them against the club’s best ten attacking players. The 15-minute game finished scoreless, despite the attacking talents of the likes of Gullit, van Basten, Rijkaard, Ancelotti and Donadoni. ([Michael Cox, 2010](http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/04/28/barcelona-inter-mourinho-tactics/))

Mourinho's tactics have changed and evolved with every club he has been to, however for this edition of the tactical discussion I've decided to contrast the attacking philosophies of Marcelo Bielsea with the defensive masterclass of Internazionale under Mourinho.

Now admittedly I'm not paricularly familiar with Serie A at all, so I cannot draw anecdotes from Internazionale's domestic campaign within this. Like many others I know, Inter impressed predominately on the European stage, in particular the way they overcame an unstoppable-at-the-time Barcelona in their semifinal encounter during the 2009-2010 Champions League (although Bayern Munich definitely 1-uped that feat in stunning style this previous season and Pep Guardiola was stung with criticism for starting an obviously-muted Ibrahimovic in both legs).

Moving on, at Inter Mourinho rotated between starting with a 4-2-3-1 and a 4-3-3 (4-1-2-2-1 for you FM13 users) formation in addition to utilising a 5-4-1 formation in the later stages of a match which seemed impossible to break down. For this I am interested in the [4-2-3-1](http://imgur.com/SjoMbLz) that Mourinho employed against Barcelona and Bayern Munich in their Champions League winning season. 

Yes it's a very common formation but you cannot deny its effectiveness. So let's break it down somewhat: a back 4 protected by 2 deep midfielders (or a double pivot as some people demand on calling it) with a band of 3 players playing behind the opposition's central midfield in addition to a lone striker. It's a beloved formation for many reasons - 2 wide-men on each flank prevents the opposition from exploiting their width, 2 midfielders close to the back 4 make it hard for the opposition to play a short passing game in the final third and 4 players in forward positions ahead of them means they are never short of an attacking option.

There is however the small details which turns a good formation into an effective one. Between 2001-2004 Rafael Benitez's Valencia grafted many narrow victories with a solid back 4 because he knew his 3 central midfielders would overwhelm the opposition and counter with 2 wingers and 1 striker. When Vincenzo Montella took on Roma as their caretaker manager following Claudio Ranieri's exit in 2011, he recognised that the 4-2-3-1 formation gave him the flexibility to [play Francesco Totti as a false #9 with Simone Perrotta just behind him](http://imgur.com/Yr9lSe9) in a formation which mimicked Luciano Spalletti's famous 4-6-0 formation with a better structure to their defensive play, contributing to an impressive [2-0 victory](http://www.zonalmarking.net/2011/03/13/roma-2-0-lazio-tactics/) over rivals Lazio.

What Mourinho often employed was a [lop-sided 4-2-1-3](http://imgur.com/32DoYhW), where the leftback (most often the 36-year old Javier Zanetti) rarely looked to venture forward whilst his counterpart on the right flank (i.e. Maicon) frequently ran into the opposition's final third. This was aided by Samuel Eto'o on the right flank who drifted towards the box as oppose to hugging the touchline (although he has been known to remain wide and utilise his pace), he also aided Maicon with his his willingness to drop back in behind Maicon when he was overlapped. Maicon also needn't worry about his defensive duties as one of the deep midfielders often roamed towards the right flank to pick up any free runners or intercept attempts to clear the ball there.

However most of the plaudits do not direct their praise towards their attacking threat, instead Mourinho's strictly organised zonal marking which effectively negates the opposition's offenses is the star of the show. In the second leg 0-1 defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League semis Barcelona completed 555 passes, Inter completed 67. Even with an extra man advantage (Motta was sent off in the game) Barca could not capitalise on the 86% possession they accomplished on the night, even when Guardiola took of Ibrahimovic and shuffled his formation into a fluid, short-passing 4-2-4.

Referring back to that quote at the beginning of this section, it could only be suggested that Mourinho spent an enormous amount of time training his players in defensive positioning and defending as a unit as oppose to relying on his players to press high or win individual battles through man-marking. In a way Inter were more comfortable without the ball than they were with it, but that's not to say they lacked an attacking threat. Sneijder and Milito were constant thorns in the opposition's side, whilst Pandev and Eto'o literally were thorns at the side, contributing both width and a dangerous presence in the opposition's penalty area. I've read that Milito possessed an unique ability to occupying and disrupt both centrebacks which would have no doubt benefited Sneijder who made intelligent runs through the defense along with the assistance of one of the deep midfielders surging forwards behind him.

I'm not entirely sure where to start with creating a tactic such as this in FM. Firstly I don't know if the lop-sided nature of the tactic was intentional or just Mourinho shaping the tactic to suit the players at his disposal. Then again when Mourinho first arrived at Inter he tried using a 4-3-1-2 formation which employed 3 central midfielders and Sneijder behind a striker partnership of Milito and Eto'o/Pandev. Things only really took off for Mourinho when he utilised Eto'o and Pandev's in wide areas in what was more of a 4-2-1-3 tactic that also saw Sneijder play slightly deeper than he previously did.

I presume the success is in the defense, get your team defensively sound through disciplined zonal marking without starving yourself of a focal point and options upfront. It should be downright unacceptable to concede goals against smaller reputation clubs (although I'm sure FM13's match engine will find a way) but at the same time don't be concerned about a possible lack of goals, we're here to try and experiment with defending as a team.

**The Discussion**

* Do we do managers such as Mourinho a great disservice by branding these tactics as 'defensive'?

* Does the allure for attacking and/or possession-based football undermine a manager's attempt to succeed with defensive tactics?

* What more could Mourinho have done at Inter? If he had stayed for longer would he have been tempted to build a more attacking squad or would he have kept defense and discipline at the heart of the team?

* Are there more recent examples of teams basing their strategy around negating stronger opposition with intelligent defensive positioning as oppose to high pressing?

* Which formation in your opinion offers the best flexibility between offensive and defensive mentalities? The 4-2-3-1 seems the popular choice, but there's still life in the classic 4-4-2 as well as the 4-5-1 which can become a 4-3-3 in seconds. Are there any more?

* What tactics do you see Mourinho employing at Chelsea in his second stint at the club?

1325449282.0	nyuz5	A few general tips that are usefull especially when managing a team with low reputation.	gyfkoy	46	1	10	"My first thread. Fingers crossed I don't screw this up. :)

Anyway here are some things I've noticed while playing FM12, that might be usefull to know. All following should work on the latest patch.

**1. Set players' value to 0.**
Players or their agents will not become upset when you reject a bid of 0. Also, no one will bid higher than 0, and thus will not meet possible release clause fees as long as the clause fees are higher than 0.

**2. You actually can reject bids that meet a release clause fee.**
At least when there are multiple bids not all of them triggering a release clause (actually this is the only scenario I've had the chance to test this so far). To reject any bid, click ""reject all unresponded offers"" in transfer center.

**3. Try to sign players on bosman transfer.**
Players are usually more interested in negotiating a contract with you when they still have not left their clubs at the end of their contracts, than when they have just become unattached.

**4. Monitor recently released unattached players.**
Unattached players will continuously lower their demands. After a few months they will accept contracts with much lower wage from clubs with considerably lower reputation than right after they were released.

**5. Do not shortlist players.**
This is usefull with previous tip. If you shortlist a player, other clubs are more likely to become interested in signing him. Instead of shortlisting a player, bookmark him, and then click the star icon on the top right to subscribe to him so you still get news if someone offers him a cntr.

**6. Use trials.**
Players on trial with you will usually be more interested in joining you/have lower contract demands.

**7. Scout all regens.**
Well, maybe not all but many anyways. The point is to scout them immediately after they have appeared before others have them under contract. In most European leagues new players will appear during March.

If you are a lower league club, use player search to filter all unattached players who are 16 or younger and send your scouts to look at them. If you have large/huge db, there could be loads of free youngsters to scout, but if you are using smaller db there might be just a few. Anyway, this way you could be able sign a real gem even if your club is in BSR (or equivalent). If you manage a club with high rep, use player search to filter all players 16 or younger who are at clubs in Premier Division and Championship (or equivalent), and scout them. You might be able to sign a talented youngster on very short notice - youth players who have not yet signed any kind of contract with their current club are more likely to be interested in joining other clubs. The key again is to quickly identify the most talented players and have them sign a contract with you rather than the club where they came through the youth system.

Looking back this morning, I found a heartbreaker of a World Cup, especially for a smaller team like the United States.

Some background. I played a very anti football style with 4-5-1 set to defensive and rigid. I would try to hold teams to no goals and poach one or two a game.

I was drawn into a group with Ecuador, Greece, and Germany, which was still a difficult group, but manageable compared to some others. I began my campaign against Germany and my tactics worked perfectly, getting me a 2-1 victory.  Next up was Greece, where I held my ground and countered for a 2-0 victory. All I had to do now was hold on for one point in order to avoid playing Spain in the round of 16. I again played my style of smash and grab football and came away with a 1-0 victory and the Group C title. However, the next day, Spain lost to Poland 3-1 out of nowhere and Poland leapfrogged Spain to win Group D. That meant That even though I won to avoid playing Spain, I was to play Spain in the Round of 16 anyways. I played even more defensive in my match, switching to a 5-4-1 which was more like a 6-3-1 and playing a contain mentality. David Villa was awarded a penalty in the 14th, and I feared for the worst. He took it, only to be denied by an amazing save from Howard. I felt as though my time was now. Halftime, still tied and I was being dominated in all categories but still playing amazing defense. 

87th minute still 0-0. Alba plays a low ball across the six. It hits my center back in the leg and deflects into my net for an own goal. I lose 1-0.

Spain then goes on to beat GERMANY in the final on penalties and my news media criticizes me for the ""disappointing 1-0 loss"" to Spain. I hate this game, but at the same time, I can't wait to be back at the next World Cup. Just wanted to share that story with you, I don't know why, but felt I needed to tell someone."	t5_2s0w5	True

***
Preface:

I decided to start off '13 local (American) and randomed into the San Jose Earthquakes. After some brief reading (and no real help on setting a formation/tactics) I just sort of made things work. I have no clue how to really play this game.

We were mid season and doing much better than expected considering my noobish blunders in figuring out the game. My biggest mistake being the purchase of a player for first team who didn't fit with my tactics (4-4-2 Fluid), and he just bitched up a storm. So I worked him in every once in awhile to keep him from talking.


***
The Game:

We face off against LA Galaxy (A superior rival team that WILL beat us) and they run my defense ragged + score a goal in the latter bit of the first half. I sub out two dry heaving/heavily fouled midfielders and cycle in the complaining transfer blunder of a player into his wing back position. I give them the helpful, and paraphrased words: Do it for the fans, because you're effed either way!

 Second half starts and, five minutes in, lose my goalkeeper via injury in a set piece. I figure it'll get ugly when I realize there are only 3 subs allowed and I'm stuck without a GK for ~40 minutes. So I do what I think anyone would do. I move the badly purchased/whiny defender into the position as a Sweeper Keeper (support) and pop everyone on attack with ""Get ball downfield"". Not sure if it would work, but it sounded like a plan.

I swear the players understood what was at stake, because we end up keeping the ball in the opponent's half the rest of the match, and score 3 fantastic goals for a 3-1 game. I couldn't believe it. I went from ""Calm"" to ""Calm, but frequently passionate"" in an instant! I was hoping for a safe loss, but instead they deliver a freakishly strong win off some really chaotic/bad kicks from the new sweeper keeper. Then the injured GK publicly states it was my words at halftime that spurred the team to perform. Then, the defender comes to me and tells me he's not happy with his new (one time emergency!) position, and I just start laughing hysterically. 

No clue what I'm doing, but apparently my team thrives on chaos."	t5_2s0w5	True

______________________________________________
Another update for you lucky people! I'd just thought I'd let you know that whilst I'm making these updates I'm putting all the information (screenshots, saves etc.) into one big file that you'll all be able to download at the end of the project, it'll include stuff such as the spreadsheet that I use to record my data and the preset I use for creating posts as well as all the screenshots and saves. Also, I've added a sort of 'news' section to the post, I also wanted to say that in the Loans and Transfers, any transfer in bold is to be consider a major transfer, this can be for a substantial fee or just a big move in general.

It can be found [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/1cj69c/reddit_fc_part_one/)!!! Unfortunately, as the game has started, I am not accepting any more submissions. However, I may post another submission request thread at the end of the season, for some new player intake!**

About a year and a half ago, I posted on /r/soccergaming about creating Reddit FC on Football Manager, comprised of actual Redditors ([Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccergaming/comments/jgo73/reddit_fc_the_beginning/))

This was quite a lot of fun, and we had at least 20 people in our team. Unfortunately, I started a new job just after making it, so it was cut tragically short. 

I have recently left that same job, so I have a lot more time on my hands at the moment. A recent private message out of the blue from /u/greg19735 (One of the old Reddit FC players) reminded me of just how much potential it had to be a lot of fun. 

So, I am resurrecting Reddit FC and am currently taking applications! The games will be played on Football Manager 2012, and until further notice, I will aim to post at least one update per day with screenshots. However, I'll post as often as I can with updates. 

The cut-off for applications will be 12pm BST/GMT tomorrow. If there are more than 50 applications, I will choose the first 50 posted.

If you want to be a player, just post in this thread with the following:

* Name (I'll just use random names with your Reddit tag as a nick-name. However, if you want another name such as your real name, put that here) 

* Age (If you are younger than 16, I'll edit the birth year to bring you to 16 years old)

* Nationality/s

* Position/s (Please put your natural position first, and then any others)

* Favourite/Least Favourite Clubs, Staff and Players

* Top 5 attributes (I will randomise them between 15-20)

* Bottom 5 attributes (I will randomise them between 5-10)

* Preferred Moves

However, there will be some minor amendments from the previous game I created. Instead of starting in English League Two, we will start right away in the Premiership (More of a challenge). As we'll be in the Premiership, I'll give all of our players a very high potential, and a current ability between 125-175 depending on age. 

I will do my best not to sign any 'normal' players unless absolutely necessary. I can also make the database available for download if anyone shows interest.

1343617551.0	xdew0	Easily the most talented midfield I've managed, and they're all so young...	ksanch	39	3	7	"So I'm very strong about developing my own players through my youth system, partly to meet the Champions League requirements but also to give the finger to the likes of Man City, Tottenham (who in my save get taken over by big spending owners), Chelsea and the like, all of who spend in excess of 30-40 million pounds every summer. At the start of the 2017-2018 season I sent my scouts to South America and Europe to trawl for young talents, I came across [this 20 year old winger](http://i.imgur.com/UBFQB.png) playing for Colo-Colo in Argentina and rushed to buy him for a cool 10 million pounds, followed by [this 17 year old youngster](http://i.imgur.com/RLQeU.png) playing for Anderlecht in Belgium at the time for 3 million pounds, a lot for someone his age but he was in their first team so I had to accept the high price.

Little did I know though that my youth recruitment network would discover some incredible gems. First I got [this good DM prospect](http://i.imgur.com/og9RC.png), then the next year (that's the 2018-2019 season) I got an amazing [AMC](http://i.imgur.com/qfilQ.png) along with [this incredible right winger](http://i.imgur.com/kxNQI.png), who despite being 15 had such incredible stats that I put him into rotation in the first team squad straight away. After just two seasons he broke the record for most assists in a season, with 32 assists in 34 league appearances, and he just keeps getting better.

After retirements and forced sales to help with finances, these guys would come together to form my first choice midfield in 2020-2021 in a 4-2-3-1 combination. We would go on to win the Premier League and FA cup. And the season after it was the Quadruple! Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, and my first ever Champions League! Not to mention, this incredible midfield came together to create 149 team goals in the league, a Premier League record! For 2022-23 I've already won the European Super Cup and Club World Championship, and am already a comfortable 11 points ahead at the halfway point of the season. I'm hoping to emulate Barcelona and win 6 trophies in a single season. And with the youngest player only being 26, I could see this combination going on for at least 6-7 more years! Provided they don't complain about wanting a new challenge...

Edit: One other player I should mention is [my left back](http://i.imgur.com/wwZe5.png), who moved to Man Utd from Ajax in 2013, when he was just 16 years old (yup, he's been at the club for 10 years now). I didn't have anything to do with his purchase because I didn't manage Man Utd at the time (SAF bought him), I only became Man Utd's manager in 2016 after a successful spell as manager of Borussia Dortmund, and after Man Utd fell by the wayside following SAF's retirement and a few bad managers coming and going. Still, when I arrived he was only 19, but because of his potential I thought the best policy to manage Man Utd would be to breed wonderkids - so I threw Evra and every dinosaur in the team out, started fresh with loans and new young players (with this guy being the best of the lot), revamped my scouting network, and the rest is history."	t5_2s0w5	True

**13 AUGUST 2011 - MORNING (PRE-MATCH)**

Zero hour. Crunch time. Erm.......High noon. I sit in my office looking over the morning's newspapers. The Sun's back page went with ""Inexperience may cost Reddit"", while The Star annoyingly ran a comedy piece about my old car. They interviewed the person I sold it to, and he claimed that he found something quite rude in the glove compartment. I rolled my eyes. I guess I would have to get used to this in such a high profile job. 

Instead, I started flicking through the TV channels. Sky Sports News were showing a piece on me, asking if I could handle the pressure. Ugh. Sky had moved the kick-off time to 12:45, and we were going to be shown on Sky Sports in the UK. My first competitive game, and it was going to be broadcasted to every corner of the world. As I got dressed in my pre-match tracksuit for training and warm-ups, I wondered whether the media had a point. It seemed like everyone was expecting me to fail. 

**13 AUGUST 2011 - MATCH (REDDIT FC v ARSENAL)**

I had finally decided on a team to face the Gunners. Leftyboy, Total Extreme Panda and Jay Swooshington would miss out due to injury, but other than that, I had a full quota to choose from. Scott would be my goalie, our captain Sir Lladz would partner Zoah in defence, and I showed faith in Douglas McTavish up front. I hoped we would also get a world-class performance from our most senior player, midfield stalwart TehRhino. 

Arsenal had still managed to keep hold of their star player, Robin Van Persie, so I expected him to feature on the team-sheet. I was not disappointed. Handed the Arsenal team-sheet by Brian McClair, it looked like Wenger was cautious of our technical ability. He was playing a defensive midfielder, in addition to Alex Song in the middle of the park. They would be difficult to break down, but I trusted that we would be able to score. [\(1\)](http://i.imgur.com/sKqNMHx.jpg)

Sir Lladz silenced the dressing-room, as I spoke to my squad. ""Well, this is it lads. This is our time to shine. The stadium is absolutely packed, and these fans will scream their hearts out for us. They have shown us support by sticking with us through the dark times, so now make sure you go out there and win for those fans!""

Sir Lladz looked inspired, and gave a motivational roar to the team. Tom Whocares, the vice-captain, encouraged the rest of the squad to join in. The whole squad looked eager to get onto the field, although I noticed that Sporkology was the last one out of the dressing-room. He looked to have something on his mind, so I expressed to him that I had the utmost faith in him to perform as I know he can. [\(2\)](http://i.imgur.com/jcoDHyR.png) He just shrugged his shoulders and skulked into the tunnel. 

As the teams were led out onto the field, I made my way to the dugout. I shook hands with Arsene Wenger, and wished him a good match. Wenger seemed to mumble something in French as he walked away. I asked Brian what he said, but he just gave me a blank look. No matter, I'll do my talking in the game. 

20 minutes gone, and Sporkology was being torn apart by Perotti, Arsenal's new signing on the left wing. If he didn't buck his ideas up, I'd have to sub him. Van Persie was through on goal, but luckily was called offside. 

22 minutes in, and TehRhino scores with a magnificent strike just outside the box. He had been dictating the tempo of the match perfectly so far, and he fully deserved his goal. The crowd cheered so loud I thought my eardrums were going to burst. 

It was nearly the end of the first half, but Arsenal were starting to feel their way back into the match. Their passing and movement was fantastic, and I had a feeling that they were going to find a way through. I hoped I could hold on until half-time. We hold on, and our players walk to the tunnel amid passionate screams from the crowd. 

In the dressing room, I tell the players that although we're playing well, I think we can play even better. ""Well played lads, great goal from TehRhino. We've got them on the ropes, so now we need to go in for the kill!""

Strangely enough, Sir Lladz and Deceived looked a bit nervous. I certainly wouldn't expect that from our club captain, but I supposed that it was his first Premiership match too. It must be tough to lead a group of players against a team like Arsenal. We got a call from the referees, and it was time to start the second half. 

TehRhino looked exhausted, so I decided to take him off before the 60 minute mark. He was replaced by Dazz. 

After 53 minutes, McTavish repaid my faith in him by expertly fainting past Scszesny, and passing the ball into an open net. I knew my squad had technical ability, but that was such a cool finish considering the opposition. We were now 2-0 up against the former Premiership champions. 

After 60 minutes, Valderamos caught Vermaelen in possession on the half-way line, and was through one-on-one. He had McTavish waiting in space to his left, but he inexplicably cut to his right, and blasted over. I could have strangled him there and then. 

I tell NewDanger and Andrew to warm up after 75 minutes, as Tom Whocares and Deceived look tired. However, just as I am preparing the substitutes to come on, Whocares goes down in the centre circle. Gary Lewin makes the substitute sign, and I know that he's been injured. Damn, just my luck. I make the subs that I planned to anyway, and hope that the injury isn't too serious. He's one of our key players. 

After 87 minutes, Arsenal manage to peg one back through Aaron Ramsey. I thought our fitness would be a problem, and it looks like I was right. It was certainly 'squeaky bum time' now. 

I glance nervously at the clock. 4 added minutes. With 94 minutes gone, we clear the ball to Valderamos. He sprints down the right wing, but pulls up awkwardly. ""Oh no..."", I moan. Arsenal don't kick the ball out. I wait eagerly for the referee's whistle. Vermaelen boots the ball up the field, and their right winger is in space. ""TACKLE HIM! GET IT OUT!"" I scream, while also harassing the fourth official: ""The four minutes are up! Why isn't he ending it?""

96:00 blinks onto the stadium display, just as the ball is crossed into Van Persie who blasts the ball under Scott. Furious, I berate the fourth official: ""We had a player out injured, and the four minutes had gone! This is ridiculous!"". And with that, the referee blows the whistle, to a chorus of boos from the crowd. [\(3\)](http://i.imgur.com/aWXPMC3.png)

My players swarm around the referee. I march towards the ref, with fire in my eyes. I'm not a bad loser, but the whistle should have been blown before that last Arsenal attack. The referee shot down my protests: ""I played the correct amount of time! Control your players!""

Reluctantly, I tell my players to give the referee some space, while I follow him down the tunnel. In the dressing-room again, the players look deflated. Brian McClair advises me that I should say how disappointed I am in the performance. I refuse his advice though, as I feel that we were robbed of a victory by poor refereeing. Also, we had the better of the play. 

I addressed the players: ""Good effort boys, we would have won that match if it wasn't for that idiot of a ref out there. You were unlucky, and we'll just have to make sure we beat them next time!"" The whole squad let out a defiant cheer, and I had managed to turn a negative into a positive for our next match. [\(4\)](http://i.imgur.com/KYpHwgz.png)

What the hellfire tits has happened to my squad?! 

My strikers are blind, my defenders are stupid and my wingers are drunk.

We were a competent Euro Cup challenging Premier League side last year, but this season we've all caught the stupid and I don't fucking know why.

God, I am so excited. I never thought that I would be able to do this entire thing and have it done so quickly, but thanks to a brilliant few of you, this is really solid. All three tiers have been completed and as far as I can tell after simming 7 years into the save, this is a pretty solid set-up. Logos are all set-up, Kits have been created for the APL and are in the works for AL1 and AL2, and there is promotion and relegation.  

Here is how the league is going to be set up. 

1. 3 automatic relegation spots in the APL.
2. 3 automatic promotion/relegation spots in AL1.
3. 3 Automatic promotion spots in the AL2. 

I will probably work on having playoff promotions for the AL1 and AL2, but right now, I want to use this as a way of having a solid framework. The playoffs may add more to scheduling confusion, so this is just simpler. 

The people that I really want to thank are /u/getextinct who made all but one of the APL kits and /u/notaquarterback who commented late on my last America League post and gave me a working database. He really was in the creative mood and he inspired me to finish this project. Finally, I want to thank Lami23 from the FM-Base.co.uk forums for giving me a database with a couple of teams finished. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to use that database, but the thought and effort was not forgotten. 

***

**CHANGES FROM v0.5.3**

* America League 1 is now created
* America League 2 is now created
* All Logos have now been added to their teams and made into a logo pack.
* All Kits, including imagined Third Style kits have been made by /u/getextinct and made into a logo pack. 
* Promotion and Relegation instituted.
* Finances/Reputation has been semi-appropriately generated for AL1 and AL2.
* Virgin Galatic League has been created. It's a Competition that pits Bundesliga, La Liga, EPL, AFCCL, CCL, and APL teams against each other in a 4 cup round competition. I did not create this, /u/notaquarterback did, so all credit to him. This may be a temporary thing as it seemed to have issues in gameplay. 
* Reputations have been increased for the APL and CCL. 

***

**CHANGES TO COME**

* Kits need to be created for AL1 and AL2
* Reputations/Finances need to be altered for AL1 and AL2
* Club Colors need to be put for each respective team. 
* Club details need to be added for each team. Ex. Founding Year, Stadium, Nicknames, etc...
* Playoffs should be created for AL1 and AL2

In /r/mw3, someone boosted and posted a screenshot of their accomplishments they'd be hounded out of it and possibly get their stats reset, here they'll get karma and pats on the back.

For example, a mediocre striker getting 95 goals in 56 games. The reason given by his manager that he got so many was because it was in the football league championship; IRL no player since it's inception has managed 30 goals in a season. (http://i.imgur.com/dTjUC.jpg). Lionel Messi in his most prolific season got 73 goals in 60 games by way of comparison. 

You're either using an exploit such as the grid formation and/or corner exploit, FMRTE, or managing the opposition or saving and reloading games. Whether you're doing this knowingly or unknowingly is irrelevant, you're cheating and you're just denying yourself the full range of emotions that you get playing football manager and destroying any realism the game provides. Posting it on the internet for praise just shows how shameless you are. 

I can't say if the following used one of these exploits or if they're fluke results but my gut is telling me they're not all legitimate.

EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION. I was asked by Kugrian, why I feel so strongly on this.

People post pictures here of them basically cheating and people will usually complement them and mention how well they cheat and get a nice circlejerk of up votes. Others post pictures and stories of bad beats, shitty late goals etc. and people will slag them off saying that they had worse and downvote it to bits. New arrivals will see the high upvoted posts and they'll mimic them and it get's worse and worse.

It's frustrating as fuck seeing posts about meagre gains made slowly over time, hard fought wins, a newb asking for advice, someone asking about tactics and the like being overshadowed by someone posting a pic of how they broke all realism within the game. I hoped that other redditors who frequent the subreddit would feel the same and play within the spirit of the game.

The best parts of FM, the ones that stay with you are the ones where you've trudged through all the shit that the game can throw at you, past the constant stream of injuries, through all those late equalisers, wrongly disallowed goals and you come through in spite of it all to get a little victory. One of the lines from shawshank redemption sums it up for me:

&gt;YOUR NAME HERE ...... who crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side.

**15 JULY 2011**

It was time for another friendly match. As I told my assistant earlier in the week, he would be in charge for the remaining friendlies we had. This time, we were playing away at Wrexham. I decided to just watch on the sidelines, leaving the managerial duties to Brian. This time, the match didn't go as smoothly, as we clawed a 3-1 win. Jollisk received the Man of the Match award, and as he was only 19, I would be keeping a close eye on his development under my management. 

**18 JULY 2011**

The fixtures were coming thick and fast now, in an attempt to adequately prepare us for the start of competitive fixtures. In our first match of the season at Reddit Park, we were playing Portuguese powerhouses Benfica. If we could hold our own against a team of this calibur, we could actually challenge for European places this season. It wasn't easy going, but we managed a 2-1 win to please the 25,000 fans that turned up for the match. Jollisk was on the scoresheet again, and I was sure that he would be an Estonian regular for many years to come. 

**20 JULY 2011**

I was sitting in my office puzzling over my best team, when reserve player Sir Sheepington III knocked on my door. ""Come in, Sheepy"", I said. ""What's the issue?"". 

""I'm concerned that I don't seem to feature in your plans. I may have to seek first-team football elsewhere as I feel I'm good enough.""

I knew this was going to be a problem, as we had a multitude of talented players in our ranks. However, I was disappointed that he was raising this issue so soon into the season. I take some pages from Alex Ferguson's book: A happy team is a winning team. I didn't like having unhappy players in my squad. 

""Well, I understand your concerns, Sheepy. We have more experienced players in our first team, but you're definitely in my plans for the future. Why don't you go out on loan for a season, and we'll see where we are?""

""That'll be great boss, I'll see you at training"", Sheepington exclaimed. I didn't want to lose him as he was a useful utility player, and I think that some first-team football would do him some good. [\(1\)](http://i.imgur.com/tRX9PbH.png)

**21 JULY 2011**

Just in time, the chairman came to me with details of clubs that were interested in being our feeder club. After perusing the options, I finally settled on Coventry City. They were a decent Championship side, and it would be a great opportunity for some of my young players to play first-team football. I decided that I would offer Sir Sheepington III for loan to any clubs, and if there was no interest, I would ask how he would feel about going to Coventry for a spell. [\(2\)](http://i.imgur.com/2R7H5e7.png)

**22 JULY 2011**

Another day, another friendly. Today we were away to FC Sochaux. After an unbeaten start to the season, we crashed to a 3-2 loss. However, Renegade scored a brace, so there was something to be taken from the loss at least. I didn't see the loss as a huge problem, as our squad was still trying to gain match fitness. 

**24 JULY 2011**

Another day, another unhappy player. This time, it was greg19735 who was disappointed to be in the reserves. Again, I couldn't offer first-team football for the near future. So, I offered him the same option as Sir Sheepington, to go out on loan for a season. Greg accepted my offer, and I would try to find a club for him. I was becoming very concerned about managing to keep my squad happy. Not even one month into the season, and two players are unhappy. 

**25 JULY 2011**

Sir Sheepington III becomes a Tottenham player for the rest of the season. I felt that it would be a good move for the young player, and hopefully he would come back a stronger prospect as a result. I also made sure to include a recall clause, so that if we need him, he can return. 

**26 JULY 2011**

This is going to be a problem. Jollisk, one of our brightest prospects, is unhappy that he isn't getting first-team football. I offer him out on loan as well. 

Brian McClair informed me of a very impressive friendly win today, we managed to beat Malaga 5-1. This was a Champions League quality side, and we had humiliated them in their own backyard. My hopes for the new season started to improve. 

**28 JULY 2011**

Bad news. No clubs were interested in taking Jollisk on loan, and Jollisk flat-out refused to go to Coventry for a season. I had to hope that I could find a suitable club for Jollisk to go on loan to, or I will be facing problems. 

In other news, greg19735 completed his loan move to Manchester City. However, I was shocked to learn that Greg had taken a parting shot at me through the media. He stated that he saw the move as an opportunity to be placed in the shop window, for prospective buyers. He was a talented player, but I was not one to stand for unprofessionalism. I would keep a close eye on Greg during his tenure at Man City. [\(3\)](http://i.imgur.com/X6aKIb4.png)

**4 AUGUST 2011**

For the upcoming International friendlies, we had a massive 26 players called up to their national senior team. In order to minimise any potential injuries, I gave half-game instructions for every player. I did not want them to be burnt out for the upcoming Premiership matches. [\(4\)](http://i.imgur.com/RRk3j1g.png)

**8 AUGUST 2011**

Time for the annual task of choosing my captain and vice-captain for the season. I had given it a lot of thought over the past few weeks, but I had come to the decision that our experienced right-back Sir Lladz should be our captain, supported by Tom Whocares as our vice. Most of the players were very happy with my choice, so hopefully this would give us a springboard for the start of the season. 

**10 AUGUST 2011**

Carling Cup Second Round draw. I wasn't too worried, as this would be a good opportunity for me to play some fringe squad members. After waiting for what seemed like an age, we were drawn away to League One's Oldham Athletic. Easy. 

**12 AUGUST 2011**

The day before the big Arsenal match, our debut in the English top-tier. Amazingly, we were considered as favourites to win the match! No pressure then!

In an interview, Arsene Wenger stated that he was really looking forward to playing us, that it should be a great match. When asked for a response by a Sky Sports reporter, I played it cool and attempted to divert attention away from the match. I spoke about my respect for Wenger, and that he is a manager that everyone can learn from. Ferguson isn't the only one who can play mind-games. [\(5\)](http://i.imgur.com/thAZNTK.png) 

I went to sleep that night with squad combinations, statistics and the friendly performances scrambling around in my head. Tomorrow, I was facing one of the most successful managers in recent memory, in my first ever competitive match as manager of Reddit FC.

But I recently found out about the Youth Academy Challenge. I normally don't do these kinds of challenges. But it seemed extremely interesting, so I decided to take the plunge with Oxford City.

For those of you who don't know, the Youth Academy Challenge is a challenge where you edit the database so that the club you've chosen (for the challenge it's supposed to be BSN/S or lower) and give them 20 youth facilities, training, etc. You can't make any transfers in, whatsoever (other than those that your parent club force upon you). You can make transfers out though. This is my first attempt at doing something like this (both the write up and the challenge itself) so if you have any criticism or anything I'm all ears. And if this is something you don't want to see then feel free to downvote.


We're predicted to finish 20th, of 22 and the first relegation spot. Of course my goal is to avoid this at all costs. Oxford City starts out with a fairly thin and small [squad](http://imgur.com/ha9i0vb) as a result of having just won promotion. There's only one [keeper](http://imgur.com/AlvCln6) in the entire squad and he's on loan from Wycombe. Hopefully our first intake includes a couple of keepers. I'll be doing my best to keep all of my current players just because we need the depth. And at the moment, any staff I sign would be a minimal improvement over my current backroom staff, so I'm going to leave backroom staff dealings for when we go Professional. The [Team Report](http://imgur.com/5IvVp00) reveals our depth situation as being even worse than I first thought, not a single right back in the entire team. Will be an interesting bit of finangling with the tactics to make this team work.

Speaking of tactics, my first set of tactics will be a [3-4-3 Counter](http://imgur.com/c2VZgYr)that I threw together real quick. If you guys have any suggestions on tactics to work with my squad, I'm willing to take any and all suggestions.

Our first of 6 friendlies for the preseason was the traditional Reserves match. This was a good opportunity for us to try out our tactics against an opponent that we should have no difficulty beating (given that they were all grey names). But at [full time](http://imgur.com/0U1nOVo) we were a man and a goal down to our reserves. This is going to be a long season if we keep playing like that. Three days later was our second friendly against Oxford City Nomads, things started off much brighter when after 10 minutes we were already 2-0 up. The [game finished 5-0](http://imgur.com/6kW8Klo) and gave me signs of hope that I didn't think were there after our first match. The [rest of our friendlies](http://imgur.com/dy8h8TJ) began to show that we weren't lacking in attacking options or opportunity and that as long as we can keep the mistakes at the back to a minimum we may be able to make a real push for promotion. My only real fear is an injury crisis at any point in the season. 

Apparently the [bookies](http://imgur.com/IxfKAph) have been watching our friendlies and agree full-heartedly that if we make our chances count and keep our mistakes down, we have a decent shot at going up in our first season.

Aside from a couple of contract renewals, that has been our Pre-Season. No transfers due to the challenge. If there's anything you'd like to see, or suggestions to make, please let me know. And again, if this isn't something you'd like to see in /r/footballmanagergames, downvote it.
