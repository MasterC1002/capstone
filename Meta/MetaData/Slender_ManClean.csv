If you came here expecting a rant, you're mistaken. This is a good thing. A very good thing. But only if we pull it off properly. If you've gone and whipped up a convincing Slenderman costume, try and wriggle yourself into the background of every photograph you can this Halloween. I don't mean photobomb. I mean nigh unnoticeable, at a window, behind a tree. This could extend beyond Halloween even. There are plenty of parks, with plenty of tourists. Let's drag Slenderman's infamy away from that game and back towards his polaroid roots.	t5_2s4md	True

1. 4 people pay $10

2. You are in the woods

3. You must collect 8 pages

4. Every page makes a sound when you collect (to build suspense, and to also let the Selnder people know to stalk/attack)

5. If he grabs you, you die. You cannot scream your location, and your friends must grab your pages if you had any

6. If you die, you get nothing.

7. If any (or all) of you survive and get all 8 pages, you get a t-shirt, hoodie, ring, poster, necklace ETC. that says ""I got 8 pages and survived the Slenderman!""

8. If any (or all) of you survive and get all 8 pages in less then an hour, you get merch, and get to watch the next ppl get scared!

9. If any (or all) survive and get all 8 pages, you get merch, get to watch the next ppl get scared, and get to BE a Slenderman!

What does /r/Slender_Man think of this?

EDIT: To the questions:
1. Every 2 minutes, the flashlights will be off for exactly 10 seconds.

2. There will be 3 Slenderman per person

3. The cycle goes,  2 pages, 3 Slenderman, 4 Pages, 5 Slenderman, ETC. until all 12 Slenderman are attacking.

4. If a Slenderman gets a person, the Slenderman and the other Slendermen who followed that person are both out, so it's not unfair to the players."	t5_2s4md	True

My cousin plays it and he calls the Slender Man ""Slender"" all the time and it annoys me. I miss when Raekay and BiohazzardBunny were here.

One night I was driving home through the woods when I slammed into a tree. My face smashed into the steering wheel and my vision turned crimson. 

I could barely move, the seatbelt kept me restricted and the car started to catch aflame. The fire brigade cut me out but I was badly burned all over my body. 

After being treated with bandages over most of my body I received word my daughter had gone for a walk in the woods and had not come home, I was devastated. I go home to my wife and she just sits there looking at my daughters school photos. 

I felt useless at the time, I was constantly covered in bandages and my Doctor and Dermatologist said my face would be badly scarred. 
Over the next few years I became very shy and withdrawn, I usually wore a mask on my face to cover it and keep it cool. The scars were too much to bear.  

Then I received word, my baby girls body had been found, her personal effects of a torch and note pad were still in good condition. 

I broke down, she was alone, noone to watch over her, thats when I took a vow. 


No little girl or boy would ever be alone in the woods again. 

And no father will ever be alone in his pain..."	t5_2s4md	True

I don't post here often at all, but I lurk. I've been a fan of Slenderman for a few years, first discovering him on /x/ (a bit after his initial creation on the SA forums). I enjoyed the creepypasta immensely. When MarbleHornets came around, I was ecstatic. Here was some quality amateur film-making featuring one of my favorite cryptids. Then, I found EverymanHYBRID and was once again highly impressed with not only their ability to weave a rich backstory involving many monsters from pasta but also the scope of their fan involvement. I haven't gotten into Tribe Twelve or any others yet, but I plan on it sooner or later. 

When Slender came out, I actually thought it was pretty cool. It didn't have fancy graphics or any origin or background stories. No sprawling, picturesque scenery. Just you, a flashlight, a forest, and Slenderman. And that's all it needed. It was scary in its simplicity. Translating the Slenderman phenomenon into a game brought Slenderman to a wider audience and gave new and old fans a fresh experience in a different form of media. 

Some of the memes suck. Some of the memes are good. That fails to ruin Slenderman for me in the slightest. I still find him terrifying, after all of these years, memes, and different exposures. 

Joel Schumacher made ""Batman and Robin"" and it turned out to be the WORST Batman movie ever. It didn't ruin the Dark Knight trilogy for diehard fans OR casual movie goers. Nobody avoided seeing the Dark Knight or any other Batman films because ""Batman and Robin"" sucked. That's how I approach Slenderman. 

Some bozo on Kickstarter may make a horrible Slenderman movie. If I think it, or anything else Slenderman related, is bad I can choose to ignore it and continue to enjoy the things I love about Slenderman. 

I liked this subreddit because it featured more immersion than the others, but lately I'm seeing entirely too many Slenderhipster posts about how the new fans are making him lame. No, the people complaining about how they knew about Slenderman back when he was still fat and all of these young teenyboppers are ruining it with their memes and their vidyagames and their internet boxes and whatnot are making Slenderman and this subreddit lamer and lamer by the day. Give it a rest. Let's just sit back and enjoy it all together. 

Each new piece of media about Slenderman is an opportunity for Slendy to evolve, or artists and filmmakers and game developers and writers to explore and create, or fans to enjoy and wee their knickers. So let us all wee our knickers in peace and stop complaining about Slenderhipster's honor being corrupted by the masses.  "	t5_2s4md	True

I've always appreciated that he has a great feel of mystery and unworldyness to him.  But then the game Slender came out, and I'm not mad at the developers, but that game seems to be ruining the entire thing.

I don't mean to be a total hipster here, but the game is making him WAY too mainstream.  I think its a neat game and all, but now you have a bunch of 13 year old kids who think they know all about Slendy from watching a PewDiePie video.  I mean, half of them think his name is ""Slender"" or that the game invented him.  And now he's becoming a part of the mainstream internet, and they've totally ruined him and his image. 

A few weeks ago a guy made a Slender facecam video for my schools morning show, it was pretty good actually.  But now everyone in my school think they're just the bee's knees for knowing about the game.  Ofcourse they all think his name is Slender, know Jack shit about him and think they know everything, ect.

I come to you as a fan of good horror.  I have a fascination with the Slender Man, as do we all.  However, at the risk of sounding overly hipster, I believe my fascination is a bit more meta than some.  I am not intrigued because I am delving into some mystery, or that I may find something.  I am intrigued because I am helping to create a mystery.  I am a part of a growing mythos that has the potential to be something truly enduring, and it taps into a true human source for its horror.

Independent film makers have, as did creepypasta photoshoppers before them, stumbled onto an enduring horror phenomenon in the form of the Slender Man.  This phenomenon is known as The Uncanny.  I have referenced it many times, here.  The Uncanny is best known from the concept of the Uncanny Valley.  It is a concept that describes the feeling we get when we are faced with something of increasing realism.  It was a term coined in robotics, and we can also directly see it in gaming.  I would definitely love it if each of you watched [this video](http://www.penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/the-uncanny-valley).

Essentially, it describes how, if we give a non-human thing certain basic human characteristics, it becomes more adorable, more approachable.  Think Wall-E.  He has big eyes and expressive eyebrows.  This creates a character with a lot of emotional depth that never says a word besides ""EVA!""  We can empathize with Wall-E because of these subtle cues.  We can tell what he is feeling and feel it, ourselves.  It's how we're tuned as social creatures.

However, when you keep adding human characteristics, you reach a point where it doesn't look like something obviously non-human with some relatable human characteristics, it begins to look more like a human with some very disturbing non-human characteristics.  Our senses of relatability and comfort drop off exponentially, even though it looks more realistic.  It really just looks disturbing.  It unsettles us because our brains are trying to interpret the thing in front of and compare it with how a human looks, versus when you look at Wall-E and it compares it to how a trash can looks.  When the equality in our brain doesn't match up, it freaks us out.  This is why people with deformities were paraded around in Freak Shows.  They gave people a little touch of horrific fascination by looking at something that was like them but very alien, at the same time.

The Slender Man touches on that point, as well.  He is something that is close to human-looking, but still retains some very definite alien elements.  There is something off about this human-ish …thing, and it unsettles us on an instinctual level.  The higher brain functions kick in and we try to reason why it is off-looking.  We hypothesize that it is something trying to camouflage itself; trying to look human, but failing in key areas.  This implies a predator and the baser brain functions again take hold.  We reason that it's trying to hide itself, a wolf in sheep's clothing, and that sends us right back to fight-or-flight.  This is the real horror reaction at work.

This is why Slender Man is cool to me.  It's not something real, or even possibly real.  But it hits on a key aspect of horror: raising those unsettling emotions.  This is why gore isn't scary but watching someone fall into a pit of needles is, or a picture of Jeff The Killer, or Smile.jpg.

Here we come to the point of this:

There seems to be a childish aspect of this subreddit that can never face the fact that the Slender Man is an entirely made up work of fiction.  To them, this is all pointless and silly if it’s not real, so they try to believe that it’s real.  However, there is no historical evidence to defend his existence.  The wood carvings were long ago exposed as photoshops, as well as every single picture of him.  There is literally no evidence to back up the existence of the Slender Man.

What you people describe as Slender Sickness, mainly feelings of paranoia, are completely normal for someone who has just watched a horror movie.  Try watching other horror movies that actually scare you, you'll feel the same effect.  This isn't because those things are real, but because your brain is aroused (not sexually) to the concept of danger and your instincts begin to kick in.  If we weren't paranoid when we felt danger cues, we'd be pretty easy hunting for predators.  Mankind would've been eaten before they left Africa, if it weren't for being on-guard.  Problem is that it's a mostly irrelevant system in modern times, so we seek that thrill from artificial sources: enter horror movies.

I love the SlenderMythos, but people here are really messing it up.  The One Rule To Rule Them All, don't be a skeptical twat, is really ridiculous.  It prevents people from examining the mythos publicly in a meaningful way.  If we can't be adults, for a second, and break from the game, then we can foster a really odd community of people who start to think it's real.  The concept of the real versus the unreal starts to break down and people get these weird paranoid delusions.  Also, if we don't have the power to shoot down people that are obviously just karma-whoring, then this subreddit will devolve quickly.

I'm more worried about people who think it's real and then make life choices based on that information.  That's my problem with religions.  If you turn down medicine at risk to your life because it's against your religious beliefs, then you are fucking stupid.  That is dangerous, suicidal behavior and it only serves to hurt you and hold you back.  I will **NOT** be a member of a community that actively fucks up the lives of people based on a paranoid delusion just because you couldn't drop the fucking game for a second.  Grow up, child.  Pretending that you disappeared or trying to scare your parents that you're being stalked is sick, sociopathic behavior.  If you want attention, there are better ways to get it.  Don't manipulate people.  The problem is the delusional will run to the aid of the liars when their beliefs are challenged.  This is some serious Stockholm Syndrome bullshit, here, and it creates a downward spiral of delusion and shit content.

Post a picture.  Make a video.  If you put in honest artistic effort, I will post an honest critique and I will not shit on your parade by saying it's not real.  That's what the One Rule really means:  don't be an asshole to other people's art with an obviously fake subject.  Judge the content, not the universe.  But, if you come in here with some shit personal story, looking for attention, I will shoot you down as hard as I can.  I do not come here to be manipulated, I come here for good art.  Let's get that straight.  This isn't a support group for Slender victims, because there are none.  If you believe that you are really being stalked, seek help.  Now.  You are delusional and you need to see that.

This is a subreddit about Slender Man horror in art, whether it be the written word, a picture, or a video.  Put some effort into it or don't come to the fucking party.  I will honestly critique real effort, and be good-natured about it, but I will not brook this paranoid, delusional karma-whoring.

Thank you for your time.

EDIT:  Upon reflection, I want to clarify something.

&gt;To them, this is all pointless and silly if it’s not real, so they try to believe that it’s real.

I believe I run the risk of being misconstrued, so I will word it another way:

Certain people can't willingly suspend their disbelief.  They are either very gullible, and believe it, or they get so wrapped up in the story, that they can't stop suspending disbelief.  They get obsessed with it and they start to believe that it is really real, as opposed to just choosing for a moment to pretend.  This is the Danger Zone. 

Then there are people who are attention whores.  There are way too many of these ""EHRMAHGERD SLERNDERMERN TERCHED MER"" posts for me to believe that all of these people actually believe.  Some people are just dicking around, trying to get attention.  You can usually tell these posts because they don't bother to proofread.  They can't spell, their use of grammar is terrible, etc.  If this were an honest attempt, it would be heavily criticized because of its poor presentation.  But since these tend to have a personal bent (""THIS happened to ME""), I am inclined to believe it is just an attention grab.  Because of this, my vitriol is much more than it would have been.

Then there are those who can suspend their disbelief, have fun with the story, pretend for a while, and then come back to the real world and sleep easy.  These people are the type of people this subreddit is for.

1345051500.0	y9qz7	State of the Subreddit and Moving Forward	Mynameisgonz	90	22	50	"Good Afternoon Fellow Slender Fans,

It is time that the issue that has been plauging this subreddit be addressed. Ever since ""Slender"" made the mainstream, we have received an influx of readers. While we are gracious for them, we believe that it has caused a massive decline in the quality of content that is being posted on this subreddit.

The reality is that Slenderman is supposed to be creepy. He is unnerving because of his inaction. The fact that he is always probably behind you, or maybe he isn't. The mystery that surrounds slenderman is one that keeps us, the fans, wanting more and more. We want to know the secrets behind this being.

Slenderman isn't about jump scares, and it definitly isn't about stupid jokes about money.

From here on out, the following rules and changes will be put into effect:

**The following are banned from this subreddit**

* Meme Images

* Let's Play Videos

* Attempts to pretend to be slenderman. Slenderman does not use the internet.

* ARG's - You can post videos, if your content is deemed to be irrelevant to slenderman, it will be removed.

* Self Posts - Write your stories from third person or from past events. Don't pretend you are being stalked, no one believes you.

**All names have been redacted**
This is a measure put in place to prevent the ego stroking that has been occuring. This subreddit is about slenderman, it isn't about you or the karma you seek to gain.

I assure you these measures have been put in place to increase the quality of content that is posted here. Even if that means there is LESS content, it is a fair trade for quality, truly scary stuff.

If you have any issues, please feel free to contact me via moderator mail. If you have any doubts about what you are posting, feel free to continue doing so, as we will actively be monitoring submissions and will remove anything that breaks the rules.

Thank you for your time and as always,

Look Behind You.

dream nor a vision or whatever. I personally 
thought it was cool so I want to know what you 
guys think.

  My dream starts off as I'm sitting in my room 
when the power goes out. When the power 
comes back on i find a note on my dresser 
with all sorts of slendy like drawings in it. As 
soon as i'm done reading it the power goes 
out again but when it comes back on hes 
standing in the corner of my room... I'm 
terrified but then he starts ""talking "" but 
its almost like his voice is telepathic and 
sounds of a child, middle aged man, and an 
elderly man mixed. weird. After an unusually 
friendly conversation with the slender man I 
find that he is extremely nice and that he 
himself isnt the monster  but yet he watches
 over and attempts to help against another being
... Anyway long story short we end up playing
 xbox and he rage quit his tenticals lifted my 
tv and through it out the window... the dream
 was quite interesting "	t5_2s4md	True

1342711275.0	wtjha	Experiencing the Slender Man's presence - the tricks of the mind	0v0Nevermore	60	7	7	"I've heard of the unbound paranoia that people fear with the Slender Man, and I've understood rationally that Slender Man would be quite a creepy figure down an alley. However, I never fully understood such fear until last December. I haven't told this experience to many people, but I feel this would be most appreciated here.

In December I was asked to be a part of a Messiah performance in a small town called Shelton. You may have heard of Handel's Messiah; it's the piece where the choir is singing ""Hallelujah,"" though there are many other songs in Handel's composition. Anyways, I played as a violist in the performance.

There were about five rehearsals before the actual concerts, and there were two concerts located at Shelton High School. On the first concert, my friend and I carpooled (my friend was in the orchestra, too), and we heard it was going to be very foggy tonight. But I had no idea. 

My friend and I were pretty good fans of Marble Hornets, and we joked every time there was technology problems that Slender Man was around. Of course, we joked about how tonight Slender Man would be lurking in the fog. I laughed it off, but I was pretty spooked at how thick the fog was during intermission. At that point in the day it was evening, and it was completely foggy out. I couldn't see past more than a hundred feet or so, possibly less, unless there was a street light or something, but even then the lights didn't reveal much. It was a cool effect.

I was walking to my car to grab some snacks my friend and I bought at the local Fred Meyer. I was walking alone. No one else was outside with me...or so I thought. When I get to my car, I look a little ahead towards the high school and what I saw froze me in my tracks.

It was Him. The Slender Man.

He was standing on top of some steps in the furthest visible reaches of the fog. And he was staring right at me. Arms out to his side. Blank face. He was a good distance away but I felt like it was the end for me. In any moment I would begin to black out and then....well, who knows?

I closed my car door and locked it, with my eyes strictly watching Him to make sure he couldn't sneak up on me. I was strafing out of the parking lot with my eyes locked on him. My heart was pounding, and my adrenaline was so intense that I almost collapsed from the fear. I figured that as long as I see him, he can't get me, cause he only gets close to people who aren't looking at him.

But then he moved. His arm lifted up. His hand went to his face. And then...

A puff of smoke came from his mouth.

I realized then that this was not actually Slender Man. It was a tall, older gentleman in a tux who was having a smoke break just outside the Performing Arts Building, but the fog concealed his facial features. Another person even came around the building to start up a conversation with the guy. I took a big deep breath and relaxed, knowing that I was fine... But I still sprinted to safety back inside the building. That experience was even scarier than having to drive back home seeing only the first 20 feet in front of me!

I feel this was the closest I ever could have experienced Slender Man. The paranoia of what he might do to you is almost unbearable, you want Him to end it for you before you drive yourself insane. And I never truly comprehended this fear until that night."	t5_2s4md	True

1331912448.0	qzhgn	History of Slender Man	BagaProductions	64	14	49	"For those who don't know who Slender Man is, he's just what you would think. A slender man. People say he's been around since the beginning of time, others just say he's been around since the 80's. 

Slender Man was created by a young man named Victor Surge to the Something Awful forums. There was a contest going on trying to create a new myth, or a monster. When Victor uploaded his monster, people took his creation and went wild with it. 

A lot of people claim to have seen him, but a lot of people strive to see him but can't. The theory is that those who fear him most are the ones who deal with him most. 
Slender Man is a very abnormally tall man, a body as thin as can be and limbs that seem to stretch on forever. He wears a sharp black suit and a blood red tie. When people look at his face, they lose it. They can't deal with it, because there is no face! It's the shallow outline of where the face should be. 
People have been obsessed with this man-like creature. It's a disturbing myth that people have loved since he was created. 

You may be thinking, 'Hey, why is this thing so scary? A tall thin man with no face? The boogy man scared me more than this guy!'
Well, I'll explain it to you.

Slender Mans prey is very particular. He only goes for very young children or very old men and women. 

in the 1920's there was some sort of dementia patients home. I'm not certain of the name or the patients, but it's around that illness. 
The nurses who worked there complained of one women who lost her mind years ago. She usually just sat there in her little chair and slept. This person was VERY old and was on the brink of death, I should add. 
The lady, before her disappearance, would now run everywhere and complain of 'the man.'
""The man! he's here!"" She would scream and throw books, cutlery, and tables. A women who used to be so obedient is now a menace!
One week later, the women was found missing, but in her room on the wall, there was a large circle with an X crossed through it. The circle appeared to be drawn out in blood.

1341798327.0	w8xoa	A Slenderman [Face] Theory	TearDrop13	60	8	35	"I was out today filming for a student film and my thoughts eventually lead to Slendy, as often they do. Somehow my train of thought decided to focus upon his face; why it's blank, why he has no face/features, ETC.

Now, I've always been very interested in psychology and amnesia's and such and such, so I was wondering...

...What if the Slenderman DOES have a face, but it is a face of such horrific characteristics that the brain refuses to acknowledge that such a gruesome sight could really exists???

The psychological side of this is, in short, when the brain sees something or experiences something that is particularly displeasing (such as your rapists face or the appearance of the person that killed your dog, whatever) the brain disposes of, or deletes, that memory, believing that it had never happened/been seen. This creates a type of amnesia, a lapse in memory.

Some remember more that others,  which to me explains why some people draw him with more distinct features, like eye sockets, although they are always humanoid.

I know this doesn't completely explain why cameras and such don't pick it up, and I'm debating on if it might be because 1.)Paranormal abilities OR 2.)Camera distortion that makes his face appear to be a blank white surface.

I'm not sure... Just some random thoughts I had. :)


-Ⓧ


EDIT: After some comments, I have also added to my theory about the cameras ""not catching his face"". If a person is looking at the picture or video, what if our minds STILL block it, even though we are not seeing it in person. With my theory above, the mind would still find it psychologically harmful and erase it, causing the blank face we know today.

When he's just THERE, it's not as scary, but this is like the PERFECT distance for him to be scary. He's far enough away that you can't really make him out, but it's VERY clear he's stalking the cameraman.

This video is the one that freaks me out the most:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQGvn82NNQw&amp;feature=plcp

Again, the quick glimpses of him are what does it, but I've NEVER seen a video where Slenderman looked so convincing. The way the light gives a brief flash of his inhuman features, his elongated form, his lack of a face, and the fact that Alex is basically trapped in his darkened house, unable to venture outside. It's Slenderman stalking brought to it's very root. What made it so scary, I think, is that this is before there is any plot to distract you from what's happening on screen. "	t5_2s4md	True

I've transferred everything here to [a blog](http://verisimilitudeproject.blogspot.com). 







I'm currently filming a dramatic web series (thus the username). I was taking photographs of potential shooting locations three days ago when I took [this photograph](http://i.imgur.com/Onf5w.jpg). I didn't see anything odd at the time, but I did have the feeling that something was around at the time of the photo. The feeling continued throughout the entire day.

Last night was when the weird stuff started.

I posted the picture on facebook, then decided to research what exactly was in the photo.
That's all I remember until this morning, when I woke up with a pen in my hand and a [drawing](http://i.imgur.com/bNE9k.jpg) next to me. My family said that I was awake the entire night, moving around constantly.

I don't recall any of it.

Checking on facebook a few hours ago, I saw that some friends of mine had identified the thing in the picture as ""Slenderman."" 

It seems you all know about this ""Slenderman"" and that it has appeared elsewhere. So, my question is: **What does this mean?**







**UPDATE:**
I've discovered a picture on my camera that I don't recall taking. It was taken at 2:55AM this morning at my back door. 

This is bad.

[It's found me](http://i.imgur.com/ZJ0PP.jpg).


**Update #2**

Hllblzr310 gave me an odd, but logical suggestion. I'll be following their advice tonight, setting a motion-sensitive camera in my room to take a few seconds of video if something moves. If anything happens, I'll let you all know.


**Update: Morning #1**

The camera hasn't caught anything yet. All the videos have been of an empty room, and a few of my overly-curious cat. 

I had surprisingly normal dreams. I dreamt I was walking around the base of a massive ash tree, with nature surrounding me. It was quite relaxing.

We'll see what happens today and tomorrow night.







**UPDATE: NIGHT 2**

The camera caught something last night.

I can think back to those early days and remember how genuinely creepy (but in a fun way) it all was. I would watch the Entries late at night, on the edge of my chair and constantly looking over my shoulder. Slender Man would be on my mind all day and the chilly fall nights had an extra edge, a thrill to them. The more I read and watched, the more this feeling grew.

But only to a point. After two years of this, the thrill is gone. The raw, primal excitement the mythos instilled in me in those early days is dead, I've grown too used to it all. I still love Slender Man and all the stories about him, but I'll never be able to recapture that feeling. And it's a little sad. Anyone else having a similar experience?"	t5_2s4md	True

Gotta bare with me while I explain some of this to you, I got a lot to explain from when this all started out.

A few months ago I got a few friends of mine into Slenderman, I figured it would be a pretty cool thing to show them. I showed them the basics, the original story and plus I gave them links to the youtubes. It didn't take long before they all said it would be cool to do our own little series.

Summer was around and we all had free time, why the hell not? 

I had no real high-end equipment but I knew enough about editing videos to do it and we had tall friends that could pass for Slenderman from a distance. I got a new SD card for my camera and we started thinking up ideas.

Living in an area that had little to no forest was the issue. Finally we decided we could use some nature preserves and one of them specifically was the best. Its by the water and its pretty damn big, not to mention it had no need for us to really ask permission to film.

We were goofing around at first, had a few time where our friends would dress up as Slendy and pop out while I tested out how the light was gonna work out. We even had times where we would set up his symbol around for others to find as a prank.

Then we started to film. It was going well, we basically treated it like a home movie. We did one whole 'episode' and I went home to edit it up. I saw some glitches, you know, small shit. Figured it was pretty cool to keep it in and added my own to it. 

The more the video went on the more I saw there were problems and finally I figured my camera was probably just old. That or it was broken from water damage. Told my friends what happened and we re-did it all the following day with a friend's camera.

We were doing good, we figured it'd be easier to film a few episodes and then start setting up a schedule when we would post it all and such. 

I had to start signing up for my new school year and noticed a lot of odd shit. I couldn't use the radio in my car and my phone was useless. I kept feeling like I was being watched. 

I would get back to my car and I'd see scuff marks. There was one right on the back that looked like something just skid against it up and down. I blamed shitty drivers around and shrugged it off. 

My friends started talking about weird shit going on too.

We figured it was all in our heads. We went on to keep hanging out at the preserve to find new areas to film and one of our friends fell. We all figured he fell from being an idiot, but he swore something pulled him back to make him fall.

The more we went on with the jokes, the more it would happen. Finally one of our friends vanished. All I got was a letter on my car from her. I'll post a photo of it tomorrow, but this is what it said:

**Don't look for it. Stop it. We have to stop this project. I'll be back after I know its all done. Don't think about it. Don't go back to the preserve. I'll try to call you in a week.**

I honestly had no idea what we meant and figured it was another joke, something to add to the whole project, right? 

I put the letter away and drove to the preserve thinking she'd be there laughing. Instead I found her backpack there with another letter and her things inside. It looked like she packed for a trip.

This one looked more like it was aimed at another friend, or her family:

**Thanks for the help, I'm going to stay at a hotel. I'll explain later.**

Everything on the bottom was crossed out. She never left that letter for them to see.

I saw some drag marks on the ground and just packed her bag up and took it with me. I was going towards the rocks, but when I walked towards the rocks I saw someone running away from me.

No idea why but I thought it was her. I followed them and ended up sliding down one of the hills. I passed out from hitting my head pretty damn hard and woke up in my living room at 4am.

It wasn't even the same damn day, it was three days later. My leg had small cuts on it and the bag was packed with more letters. Some were burnt. Some looked like they were rushed. Others were long as fuck. I have to go through those still. They're all from her.

Going through it I realized I was feeling light headed. 

Then I woke up back at the preserve a day later. I had about twenty missed calls and another letter. This one ended short, it looked like she was shoved away from the paper.

Every ten minutes I felt light headed, then it got longer before it happened. That's when I was at my college. I used a computer and logged on here and made an account. I logged on and figured it had been 25 minutes, I was safe.

Then I blacked out again. It was a few minutes before I made the account and I was at the local park. A few parents stared at me and I panicked. I checked for how much battery my phone had and I managed to type out to you all just in case and I ran home. I ran and locked the doors and emptied the letters out.

No light headed feeling at all. Nothing. I'm taking photos of everything including my car, I'll just keep figuring this all out. 

One of the odd things that made me know it was him wasn't that I saw him myself, I never 'saw' him. At least I don't remember seeing him.

The video is wiped and all I got was a few photos. One of them is her and another friend and someone in the back, just part of them. It looks like him."	t5_2s4md	True

* Slenderman is not real, you're not being stalked, and there is no such thing as a proxy. If you disagree with this statement (remember, this is a meta post), then you need mental help. Seek a psychiatrist immediately.

* We all suspend disbelief for the sake of the subreddit. If we didn't, there'd be almost nothing to talk about. When someone posts fiction, they are basically assured that people will play along.

Now, if you're going to post that you're being stalked, please put some damn effort in. These days, this kind of post is always the same basic thing. ""I saw this thing and that thing, I think I'm being stalked, what do you think?"" The ""evidence"" concocted for the tale is always designed to be leading, and for anyone to even suggest that the poster ISN'T being stalked wouldn't even make sense given the ""evidence"".

I really want to see this subreddit get back to good stories that aren't just half-paragraph ""Oh no, what do?"" posts with no plot and flimsy circumstances. If you're gonna put the effort into some new creepypasta, post it; first person is fine, too. If not, don't bother posting that same, tired paragraph or two."	t5_2s4md	True

 **1.**   Don't be a **Skeptical Twat**.   There is a lot of content that requires us to suspend disbelief.  While it's okay to be skeptical if it's done poorly, the key thing to remember is to not be a twat about it.   

**2**    Reddit is a content aggregator. For submissions, upvote things you like, and downvote things you don’t. This ensures the best content gets pushed to the front page. Never downvoting worked great when we had less than 5,000 members, but times have changed. For comments, avoid downvoting because you disagree with someone. Downvote comments if they either attack someone, or are not following the guidelines outlined here (namely rule 1).

    
 **3.**   Try not to flood the new queue with content. If you have a lot of submissions you would like to post at once, spread them out over several minutes. Alternatively, consider posting a self-post with several links.

 **4.**   Before submitting something that you believe could already have been posted, please check with the search bar.  Re-posted content is subject to removal.

    

**5.**    If possible, link directly to the source (deviantart, etc) when submitting posts. The artist will appreciate the credit. For deviantart, post using the “post to reddit” button, located on the right column of the deviantArt page. Alternatively, use the fav.me link.


**6.**    Please keep all content Slender Man related. A song on youtube that reminded you of Slendy does not really count, for example



**8.**    Please use the report button if you believe a post is not appropriate for /r/slender_man. This lets the mods know very clearly that you would like someone to verify the post is appropriate. If a comment or post links something that’s extremely NSFW, notify the moderators via modmail immediately. For comments, report when someone is being attacked personally, or NSFW links are being posted. Report blank posts if they are derailing threads, or being disruptive.



**9.**    Encourage new members to read the sidebar and guidelines, and guide them in the right direction if they make a mistake. Ensure you do so in a respectful and kind way.

**10.**    Memes are a ""sometimes food"". sometimes, they're pretty amusing and should be shared.  Other times, not so much.  Please use your good judgement if you plan on submitting a meme.  And don't get too upset if it's removed.  

Note: These rules will adapt over time to suit our needs. If you have a new rule suggestion, or have a suggestion for making a rule better, please leave a comment below with your suggestion.

His arms were long, his head was small
I've never seen a man so tall
His arms reached out and grabbed me tight
I went along without a fight
I looked and saw he had no face
And then my heart began to race
He spoke to me without a sound
And picked me up right off the ground

**March 4**

Today's case really gave me the willies. A warehouse on 194th caught fire and burned three people. Standard stuff, but when we got to the warehouse and looked inside, there were no bodies. Anywhere. We checked the closets and storage spaces, even the trunks of every car in the parking lot. Which begs the question: Where are they? What happened to them? We don't know. There was something, though. On the back of the door, the main door, somebody had definitely painted a circle with an x through it, in blood. And it had to have been painted there *after* the fire. Oh, one more thing: None of our cell phones worked inside the warehouse. Radios, too. Communications went dark in there the whole time we were snooping around. Weird.

**March 7**

Im currently in the national park outside town, investigating a missing persons. This time it was five teenagers vacationing at their folks summer home. Probably got lost in the woods, is all. We started snapping pictures of the cabin, the surrounds, the trees, anything we thought was relevant. I just finished looking through the images and every one looks shaky. Like two pictures were taken and they were just out of sync with each other. Our cell phones went out again, too. We were dark all day, nothing would work. Not radio, satellite, or our phones. 

**March 8**

Day two in the forest, and i gotta say, i didn't sleep a wink. I was picturing the five teens running through the woods, but not just jogging for exercise, they were *sprinting*. Running from something. Anyway, my growing paranoia aside, we found the first body this morning. It was impaled on a tree branch, about thirty feet up. We had to wait until after lunch for a truck to get here with a ladder tall enough. Tellya what, the boys did not like waiting around all morning looking at that thing. It was Mike, the eldest of the group and the boy who's parents owned the cabin. He looked intact, except for the chest wound. There were no broken bones, but there were stitches. About two hundred fine wire stitches riddled his body. We're going back to base first thing tomorrow morning before the men go insane.

**March 10**

My encounters over the weekend and on the 4th have led to my case being escalated. I now refer to this abductor/killer as 'The Operator'. Some joke about the comms going dark or something. Giving him a name doesn't make it easier to deal with, though. Mike's autopsy results came back earlier today. His internal organs were all severed from one another, and heres the fucked up part, they were all *wrapped in god damn plastic*. Like butcher meat, but it was his *organs*. I don't know what to make of a killer who does that sort of thing. I guess i don't sleep tonight, either.

**March 21**

We somehow got the town involved in the search for the 'Forest Four' as the media puts it. Fucking vultures for a good story. There was another circle-and-cross found at the cabin, etched into a nearby tree. The search of the forest wasn't going well until yesterday, when one of the guys found a digital camera. One of the nice, expensive ones. We had one of the grossly overpaid government techies turn over the footage and screen it for clues and boy, did he find a big one. Several times in the clip, when the holder (a girl named Julie, one of the four) waves it past the trees, or over to the side, the screen jolts hard with static, like someone dropped it on a rock or something. We looked more closely at those times, because it seemed like there was no trauma happening to the camera, and saw something. A man, in the forest. He was dressed in an evening suit, of all things and… tall. So tall. By estimations, he could be a good nine feet! He was too far off to make out facial features, but his build should limit the searches.

**May 19**

The McGregor house was all the way across town, but Loccy offered to drive, so thats something. Trusting guy, that Loccy McGregor. He explained how he'd heard of the circle-and-cross symbol at the warehouse downtown and said one had appeared on his house earlier in the week and how, only yesterday, his daughter hadn't come home from work. He said it was in chalk, right on his front door. There'd been a lot of pranks like this since The Operator had grown to public notoriety. When we got to his house, i did my usual 'Operator Check' and tried to call the landline of his house. When i lifted my phone to my ear and heard only static, i knew this one was real. Loccy, I said, this isn't a prank, you need to get out of your house right now. I guess i looked kinda pale on the phone there, he didn't even argue. Hell, he didn't even go in to get some stuff. Always trusting, that Loccy.

**June 30**

Local news did a live broadcast from the taped-off McGregor house today. I watched it more to gauge the public opinion than anything else, but it was damn lucky i did. About four minutes into the report i noticed a frame or two of static on top of the feed. I stopped the recorder right there and took a look at it. First time, the attractive blond with the mic is talking, then she gestures to the house and turns towards it. The cameraman adjusts his shot, and theres the frame of static. I slowed it down, then. The cameraman adjusts his shot, theres the static, and then a very slight readjustment of the shot. I slowed it again, careful to pause on that frame of static and what i saw sent me cold all over. There he was, The Operator, in the furthest inch of my TV set, in the space where the cameraman's adjustment overshoots its mark. I called the station and told them to hold the footage.

**July 9**

I was coming home after another prank in town. Fucking teenagers tagging the circle-and-cross on doors and in the dust on cars. I decided to walk. I took up smoking again. 

**July 14**

There was one on my door, today. A circle-and-cross. Every time i see them i check my phone for a connection. I decided to call work, then, just to be sure The Operator wasn't fucking with me. Jamie answered the phone, greeting me with his usual ""Sup, boss?"". I hung up immediately. He was pretty familiar with me doing that lately.

**July 22**

Another one of the 'Forest Four' was found today. Julie wasn't in a tree, though. Her body had rotted off the tree and she fell into a creek. Her organs? Same deal. Each was vacuum wrapped in butcher's film and almost perfectly preserved. I had a call open with base the whole time i was over there, and didn't hear a peep of static. Ive begun feeling unsafe without my phone near me, or the CB in my truck.

**August 8**

There was another circle-and-cross on my door. This time, The Operator definitely was nearby. My phone was dead, the CB was dead, but i didn't wait for more evidence. I just drove straight back to work and decided to hunker in here for the night. Theres a kitchen and showers, and i can fashion a bed on a cot we use for stakeouts.

**August 13**

Okay, I've stayed here at the station for longer than i thought. He's definitely tagged me. Im sitting in the bathroom right now with the door locked. The phones in the building went dead while i was taking a shower, and when i went to leave the room, there was a large, red, circle-and-cross on the bathroom door. Loccy and Jamie were sharing a nightcap when i came in here, but i couldn't hear them when i opened the door. I think he's right outside. I think i can hear him scratching.

Well. 

This has gotten a wee bit out of hand. I apologize for not being more involved in this community and for letting it get this way. I want ARGs and self posts to be allowed. If we took that away from you guys, that's completely shitty and censorship (I think) and I don't want to be that cunt. Not today, not ever. 

HOWEVER. 
On the issues of Slender, Memes, and ""Slendermans"". 

* Slender: There's /r/gaming for Slender. Take it there. It was fun when we started, but now it's a little loco. There's also an r/slender subbreddit waiting to be filled. 

* Memes: I like em, I want them to stick around, but the quality can't get overly fucking stupid. Y'all have to do your job as a community. Upvote the good shit and downvote the bullshit. HELP US HELP YOU. 

* Slender Impersonators: Can we just stick to the one? And  make it a good one? The user totheark was a great example while he lasted. But if you're just a troll, expect a ban from someone. 

As I said, help us help you. If y'all want this to be a great awesome community, do your part to report stuff and downvote like crazy. If it's shitty, let us know or downvote it. We want to make this great. Hopefully we can redact these damn redacteds. 

Until next time,

I live with my partner but my mum always visits us with my pa, sometimes they stay with us. Their room faces out onto a back yard that then leads onto an ''urban forest'' if that makes sense, trees planted in suburban areas to try and preserve the green belt etc. All that jazz.

Well last night was a usual night, we all went to bed at about 10pm, nothing out of the ordinary as I was working today.

At about 1am in the morning I was woken up by what sounded like stones being ''pinged'' against my window. I was instantly freaked out; my bedroom overlooks a church that has no gravel driveway or indeed anything that could be thrown at the window. 

It went on for about three minutes, a steady tapping that kept shattering the silence that I sat in. Bricks were shat, my friends, bricks were shat.

I managed to muster up the courage to peek out the curtains. As I moved across the bed I woke my partner up, he sleepily says ''that tapping was there last night too...'' 

As I pull back the curtains, I see a streak of... I don't even know what it was. Shadow, I suppose. I see a dark shadow kid of 'blend in' to the darkness. The road outside is lit by dull lights on the church, but this darkness seemed heavy, almost like I was trying to look through deep murky water. This shadow just dissipates into the darkness, I can't compare it to anything because it is unlike anything I've ever seen.

I sat on the edge of my bed looking through the curtains for what seemed like ages. I felt guilty, an unusual feeling like I had intruded on something. I felt cold and isolated...

I manged to settle back into a fitful sleep, punctuated by images of long, thin fingers entwining around my neck, my back, cradling me. I knew what I was experiencing. I knew what it was.

Morning came and fuck... I was scared. I felt afraid. My fear must have hung in the air like a bad smell because everyone seemed to be avoiding me today, tiptoeing around me. 

My mother called me today. Says she had a fucked up dream of a tall, faceless... thing... stood at the end of the bed. Just watching, silently, calculating it's next move. She laughed, says ''he was supremely terrifying, but he was dressed impeccably, in a suit that would not look out of place on a King.''

I know... I have nothing to fear, I know that he's just a fucking figment of over active imagination, but that doesn't stop me from seeing Him stood in the corner, yet when I turn he isn't there. Fuck knows what will happen to me."	t5_2s4md	True

They would say they had no idea what I was talking about. It was a cool story fro me to tell at campfires and sleepovers, and something that I liked that was all to myself and I sort of liked it.

Now everyone, even the jerk jocks at my school know about Slenderman because of the game. Now, I'm not gonna lie, the game is pretty cool and all, but the kids at my school flip out over it, calling it ""terrifying"" and ""nightmare-inducing"".

So here's my question too all of you... Ever since Slender, have any kids around you become a little TO crazy about it??? I mean, I love Slenderman and all that, but it's one thing to have fun with the idea of Slenderman, but another thing entirely to full on believe he exists and pretend you're a total expert even though they've only ever played the game.

I don't mean to sound judgmental or anything, but just because you played the game once or twice, doesn't mean you have to talk about Slenderman and ""Gimme 20 Dollars"" every second of every school day.

Something very strange happened to me last night... Something I still can't quite understand... It was about nine fifty-five last night when it happened. It was about time for me to be getting to bed, so I took my ten-year-old mutt, Daisy out for her last bathroom break for the night. I've been having problems with mild Slender Sickness lately (namely nausea, severe headaches and extreme paranoia), so I knew he'd been following me again. As I stood in the strip between the fence of the next-door neighbor's fence and my own font door, I watched Daisy trot off into the dark. Then the weight set in... I knew he was watching me, but i couldn't tell from where. I had my back to the street for a few seconds as I tried to pin-point my observer's position, then I remembered where I saw him last time. He had stood beneath the street lamap across from my home, which was directly behind me. I turned around to see him there, watching me. I froze, just as I had last time and bit the inside of my cheek from screaming. My mother was still inside and awake, so I couldn't call out and draw her from safety. I felt my eyes go wide as panic shot through me like a lightning bolt. My muscles coiled and my heart began racing... I stood like this for maybe five or ten seconds before I blinked. What happened next was a little too much for me to comprehend. In the split-second it took me to open my eyes, he had suddenly crossed the street, came into the tiny strip I was standing in and stood only inches from me. In my coiled state, I was mildly surprised after turning this over that I didn't jump backward. Still, there he was, hunched over, face level with mine. The weight of his eyeless gaze had me locked in place it seemed. I was so scared that I could feel a lump of vomit rising in my throat... I think I tried to move, but I'm not entirely sure. Then it happened. My eyes were drawn to a bit of motion near the lower right of my vision. A pale, thin hand drew up... His icy fingers grazed downward across my face... The feeling was one I could only describe as ""cold'. Mind you, it's April in Tampa Florida. What I felt was definatly his fingers, for it was too warm out to be anything else... I closed my eyes tight, expecting to wake up to the sight of the Pearly Gates, but when I opened them all I saw was the light across the street. Daisy trotted up behind me and gave a small yip, then jumped up on m legs as though hugging me. She did that whenever she was ready to go inside... It was over... Just like that...

My question now is: Why? Why would he want to touch me? He had a perfect oppernunity to take me, but he didn't. Why not? Does this touch mean anything? Please, I'm really scared and I have no clue what's going to happen to me, or worse, those around me...


EDIT: Thank you, everyone for the advice. If anything happens, i'll be sure to let you guys know. Thanks so much for the support as well."	t5_2s4md	True

Leviathan666	33	7	18	"I've noticed Slenderman's methods for killing, when looked at as if he were a normal serial killer, point to some sort of thirst for power. He stalks his prey for years and years, tormenting them until they are at the point of begging for it to stop. He always appears wearing what you would expect him to wear if he were in charge (army uniform in early German lore, business suit in modern day america) he kills his victims in the most invasive way possible; by ripping them open and taking out all their vital organs. (this would fit the bill if they were alive at the time).

All signs point to a need to make his victims feel powerless, therefore making himself feel more powerful. Any thoughts on this theory, guys?"	t5_2s4md	True

1352257197.0	12rq3r	He's Coming.	MySonsdram	39	16	5	"About a month back I got a text message from my best friend Ryan.  It was strange to say the least.  All it said was ""#x*h3re#x.  I didn't pay much attention to it, assuming he was drunk or something.  I got to my class the next day, which he was also in.  He wasn't there.  I little concerned, I called him after class just to make sure he got home safely.  No answer.  After two more calls, I got another text.  ""@$h31p#x#.""  At that point I got worried, so I decided to go visit his place after my other class. 

When I arrived, I saw he wasn't home.  However, the door was unlocked.  This really worried me.  He always made sure to lock it.  He'd even berated me a few times when I'd forgotten.  Tentatively I stepped inside.  The place was a mess, but that surprisingly I didn't care about.  He wasn't the neatest person.  I looked around, and eventually found that the bed was made, meaning he didn't make it home.  It's at this point that I heard the door slam.  Startled I looked behind me.  

And that's when I knew.  The door was covered with pages.  Drawings of a tall, thin man.  Writing saying ""help me"" and ""he's here"".  And pages with a symbol.  HIS symbol.

I already knew who HE was.  I'd even watched some of the videos.  I just didn't want to believe.

I ran.  I ran harder then I ever had in my entire life.  I knew what had happened to him, and that there was nothing I could do to save him from his fate.  I just prayed I could save myself from mine.  

That night I didn't sleep.  Every little noise was HIM.  Every passing light was HIM.  I cried and prayed that I'd make the night without being taken.  I did.  The sun rose, and I smiled thinking that I was going to be ok.  I even laughed while pouring my cereal.  What was I thinking?  HE wasn't real.  Ryan had obviously just been messing with me.  He'd probably even filmed it and was planning to laugh it up with my other friends.

It was when I went back to my room that I saw it.  Sitting dead in the middle of my floor.  A single white piece of paper.  With HIS symbol on it.  

I searched my apartment, looking for any trace of someone.  There's no way that anyone could have gotten in.  There's only one window, and I live in an aparmtent pretty high up.  I even double lock my door.  

Every morning since, a new page has been waiting for me.  Some with HIS picture. Some with HIS victims last words.  And some just with that symbol on it.  I've tried to see how they get there.  I even pulled a Marble Hornets and taped my place with a few cameras.  Every night, they go black from 10PM to about five minutes before I wake up.  Every time.

I haven't heard from Ryan.  I don't expect to.  I know he's gone.  And all I can do is wait. 

Wait for the Slenderman to finally take me."	t5_2s4md	True

At first, I thought he was flaunting something.

His chest was puffed out and his arms were back behind his torso, almost curving so that the hands pointed in front of him. His head was tilted back and to the right, and he was pure white.

Something about this guy gave me the heebie jeebies, like he could've been a zombie. So when we passed him, we circled around the block to get a look at him from the front and, well...

He was gone.

There were only 3 establishments that he could've gone into.
There was a McDonalds, which was across the street, a High Life Lounge, which was only about 15 feet away from where we last saw him, and a Kroger.

When we drove past he was walking in front of the entrance to Kroger, so he most likely wasn't going inside there, and, if this was a human, he was dressed too nice to be going somewhere like McDonalds or High Life lounge.

One more thing.

When we drove past him, I tried to get a glimpse of his face.
His head was cocked back, so I didn't see much, but I got the impression his eyes were closed. Even though I didn't see his eyes. Or a nose. Or a mouth.

I originally titled the piece ""Sleep Away Camp"", but it was retitled ""The Trees"" for print. The printed version is essentially a first draft, I submitted it simply because I wanted to show a few of my friends what I'd been working on. It was written as part of an ongoing anthology of Slender Man oneshots -- transcripts of news reports, first hand encounters, declassified government reports, etc. compiled by the fictional character James Alexander. Even though Slender Man is a public domain character, he will never be mentioned by name. 

The piece was printed in Teen Ink magazine, which goes to schools all across the US and has a readerbase of approximately 500,000. Teen Ink features written pieces and artwork from teenagers.

1374974016.0	1j6xdn	Concerning EMH...	RichardTanner4	29	5	7	"So  the ARG's have been a fun ride.  Specifically, Marble Hornets, EverymanHybrid and Tribe Twelve.  When I first got into them, Marble Hornets was by far the best, but something happened.  There were too many filler episodes and just too much no action that seemed like they had no idea where to go with the story (that being said, they are back on a good trek again).

So I turned to Tribe Twelve and it grew and grew.  It never stopped getting better.  I still think this is the best done one.  The dude is a genius filmaker.

  But Alas, I caught up and needed more to watch and I went to EMH.  To be honest is just a piece of shit for the first 30 episodes.  Some laughs, but its a  bunch of kids making jokes about Slenderman... but something happened that I can't figure out.  I wanna say it happened about the time *Spoiler*  Jeff dies.  I realized that Evan was a great actor.  Like hes passionate about it.  It became a focus of acting which no other ARG does.  

Tribe Twelve like playing with the special effects and subtleties while Marble Hornets is working the story line conspiracy stuff.  They work, but EverymanHybrid is the only one that I want to hear every line and quote it.  Its clever, funny and emotional.  I care less about the action and more about the moment.

Before you flame the comments calling me a fucking hipster, think of it this way: how would you feel if a lot of people took a beloved book, skimmed the back cover, and then started spouting about how they knew the entire story inside and out, started writing fanfiction, making movies and fanart based off the back cover, and then recommended reading the back cover of the book to everyone? Essentially, that's what happened when the game cropped up all over the internet. When multitudes of people learn about something new, there's always an influx of people that degrade the quality. 


However, I said I didn't like *much*. I didn't say all of it. The resultant popularity did spawn a few gems, such as Proxy. That's really what I wanted to say. Proxy is actually pretty good.

Once. 

 Bored, up late, looking for a good horror story. And wasn't our friend Slendy always the best? Even after stupid fucking 13 year-old kids ruined the best of places with their never-ending “OMG, they're's a guy in a suit following me, wut do i do?” bullshit, you kept coming back here and to places like it. Because of what Slendy was. Unstoppable. Faceless. Mysterious. Made-Up. 


Even though Slendy would make my pulse race like no other, I could always close my laptop, or look at some kittens to know I was safe. He was just another fucking story I could pull out to entertain myself. I pulled a couple of my friends in too, scaring the shit out of them with Marble Hornets and all the old creepypasta one night; apart from a few of the more gullible ones, it was just a story for them too. And I suppose because of that it's my fault for what happened to them. I'm not going to keep you in suspense here, they're dead. Or at the very least, taken. Which probably amounts to the same thing.

Stop. You're probably thinking to yourself, “Great, finally a proper story, I knew there was a reason I still came here!” and you're probably glad that this isn't just another picture of a circle with a fucking x through it showing up in another meaningless nowhere. Stop. This is not a goddamned ghost story. And now, you're probably annoyed with me for trying to scare you with that old trick. I want to remind you that I was like you. Once. That Slendy was just a story for me. Now take a moment and ask yourself, What would you think if you actually found yourself being attacked by a creature, who, before that point, you believed to be a work of fiction? How would you ever tell someone without it being labeled another ghost story? 

Back in high school, I had a pair of good female friends who lived pretty close to a graveyard. Teenagers being teenagers, they received dares all the time to spend the night there; dares which were always denied. Anyway, one night, towards graduation, a mutual friend finally convinces these two to spend the night in there, provided he kept them safe. If you're wondering how he managed to swing that deal, I have been assured by credible members of the fairer sex that the gentleman in question was “Really fucking hot.” I also found out later that the pair had been frightened by recent sightings of a strange man, and were genuinely counting on this gentleman to make them feel safer. This mutual friend of theirs, also happened to be my best friend, and chose to share these plans with me, on the understanding that I would do something clever. Unfortunately for the trio, I am tall, thin, and a massive asshole. 

You can see where this is going. 

After using some liquid latex applied across my face to deaden my features and give me a ghostly pale complexion, I donned my suit and drove to the graveyard in question. I arrived shortly before 2 am, on a cold, moonless Colorado night. I parked a short walk away to hide my approach, and made my way to their campsite. As I approached the tent, they were still up, laughing and sharing some stolen booze to lighten the mood. From the sound of things, the mood had needed quite a bit of lightening. It wasn't long before one of them exited the tent to relieve herself in some bushes. Moving quietly, I got myself between her and the tent before turning my back to her to watch the tent and wait. It was so dark out, she couldn't see me until she was only a few feet away. Hearing her gasp, I quickly turned around, and raised my arms over my head, moving them with as much aberration as I could muster. Judging by her scream, the effect was quite terrifying. Cruel as I am, she was my friend, and I knew to remove the latex-made mask and  end the joke. Being tackled to the ground by my friend also made an explanation seem like the right course of action. 

Several dozen apologies and a few too many drinks later, I was forgiven and spent the night there with them. We didn't really sleep that night. What we did is really none of your damned business, but one of the girls mentioned that she thought she'd gone insane when she saw me earlier that night. I didn't tell her I'd been there less than ten minutes before I'd scared them. And I chalked it up to my imagine every time I felt watched that night.

I am so fucking scared right now.
I was walking home from tafe listening to my iPod
When it starts to get all fucked up, skipping songs, jumping etc....
When I look up I'm in a little clearing in the woods about 5 km from my house( this is my normal route btw) anyway... I see him across from no more than 10 meters away... I'm not talking about a glimpse... I fucking saw him!!!!! We stood there for what seemed like an hour, he slowly tilted his head whilst ""staring"" at me, and started to reach for me...I don't think I have ever moved quicker in my life! Because next thing I know I'm home locking the door and panting.
I won't be able to sleep tonight at all. 

Just some background I have had dreams about our tall friend since about 14 I'm now eighteen. 

Can someone please help me
PLEASE 

Update

Last night I didn't even sleep... Felt like I was being watched.... Anyway I have heard that people film themselves at night and stuff... Think I might do that, maybe take some photos of where it occurred.

I will keep reddit updated though, maybe my experiences may help someone else.
Everything that has occurred is real and not some feeble attempt at a new series.

Here's some photos of what occurred over night... I have no memory of this at all....

MattTrobinson	30	7	3	"Okay so I don't think this was the slenderman and I know he's not real, but I still am left with no explanation. Okay so yesterday a r/slenderart subreddit was created as a place for people to dump all their slenderman drawings instead of here or r/slenderman, I thought it was a good idea so i asked to be a moderater and was made one. I of course was happy to put some time and effort into this much needed subreddit, so I wanted to promote it. I started out just redirecting people to the page whenever they posted any drawings and I also wanted to get some posts up there so that it didnt look so empty. So I opened up the procreate app on my iPad and began to draw away, I cranked out a few drawings pretty quickly (they can be seen on r/slenderart) and then I began to work on another, a drawing of slenderman leaning back in a recliner with  his feet up on a desk, I hadnt exactly thought out where I was going to go from there but at the time it seemed like it wouldn't be too difficult to make something humorous out of it with some clever captions. I use the procreate app quite often and have never had any problems, I quickly sketched up an outline of the photo in about 8 minutes. Satisfied with my work so far I took a picture of the screen and sent it to my friend to show him what I was working on (pic I sent him: http://i.imgur.com/LKlXs.jpg ). I instantly started to feel incredibly drowsy out of seemingly nowhere shortly after sending the text, which I perceived as strange because I Was on twenty milligrams of focalin at the time, which generally makes me unable to sleep. I just assumed that the fact that it was so late was making me too tired for my medication to counteract and I dosed off shortly after coloring in slendermans suit and shoes. With the iPad sitting on my bed turned on and left on the drawing. When I awoke less then four hours later to go to school, my ipad out of batteries as I do not have a backlight timer so it stays lit all night. (which I should probably change), at the time I didnt notice it but I now think it was unusual for my iPad to run out of batteries being on for four hours as I remembered the battery was on roughly 85% percent before I crashed, and I usually never have problems with battery life. So I went to school and had I fairly normal day (for me at least) and I took the bus home to my dads house (well actually I missed the bus because i was buying a soda and my mom drove me to my dads house instead. I just got there about an hour and forty five minutes ago and plugged in my iPad about an hour ago. When the iPad was charged enough to turn on I decided that it would be a good idea to try to finish the drawing I had been working on last night ( which I had almost completely forgot about ) so I opened up the app and selected the drawing, much to my surprise the drawing had some white scribbles and dots sparatically covering it. I thought it was strange that there would be that much scribbles and dots because I fall asleep drawing on procreate all the time and the most that I've ever seen scribbled on it when I awoke was one or two lines and never dots. ( pic of drawing at this time http://i.imgur.com/k1csB.jpg ) but I figured that drawing in my sleep was the only solution ( not actually drawing but like rolling around and hitting the screen by accident ) so I disregarded it and started re-blacking out slendermans jacket and then I went to color the desk in so I selected the brown water color brush and made a new layer behind the original drawing and started to color in the desk. and then I realized that there where more white dots and scribbles there I just didn't notice them because they blend so perfectly with the background but could be seen when they were over top of the brown watercolor brush. So I was like ""fuck there is more of this shit and I colored the brown all over the page to see how much erasing I was dealing with. The result was quite impressive, I was met with hundreds of scribbles and thousands of white dots covering the page. At this point I was far skeptical that I could've done this while sleeping and I know for a fact I don't sleepwalk (pic of the scribbles http://i.imgur.com/X9G2w.jpg )
I have tested out drawing on the screen like this by rolling my hand/ body/ etc. around on the screen and was not able to create more than one line and no dots, the only way I was able to recreate anything similar to this was by intentionally scribbling and poking the screen and it would take me at least a good 20 minutes at least if I tried to put that many dots and Scribbles on the screen, I also considered that one of my family did it but I towel the bottom of my door so that if anybody entered my room I would be able to see that the towel had Been pushed aside, and the towel was definitely exactly the way I left It when I woke up. I've been scanning the scribbles for messages for a while now but I cant seem to find anything other than what seems to resemble letters that could be created by random scribblings, If you guys see anything or if you have any theories please tell me. 
                                   PS: I'm typically a logical guy and assume there has to be a logical explanation but nothing seems to make sense

1346283946.0	z1qmk	So I thought I'd try and write a Slender Man story in 350 words or under. This is my attempt. This is 'Thin'	DaddysThreeWay	26	5	3	"The forest creaked in the silent darkness. Lights from a far away house flickered as he moved through the trees. The objective was simple; getting out of there as quickly as possible. There were rumours and myths that flew around with forests like these. Big, tall trunks that appeared out of the darkness, as the torch he was carrying cast it's less than comforting light upon them. 

He didn't often believe rumours but he had felt he had to find out. For hours he had walked, quite calmly, over gnarled roots, and between caves of bark. The hours stretched on and his calmness dwindled. The myths had begun to creep inside his mind, and everywhere he looked he thought of seeing a strange silhouette staring at him. 

He kept walking for 10 minutes, and then stopped. Blood drained as he looked towards the house, now barely 100 metres away, and saw a figure at the window, standing perfectly still. The torch flickered and a chill flowed through his veins as he saw that the figure had disappeared. Unsure of where to go, or how to get out of the forest completely, he turned around. 

A sharp pain hit his lungs as he swung around, and his throat seemed to tighten. He grasped at his shirt collar and felt thin fingers wrapped  around his neck. He pulled the fingers back and ran, dropping the torch in the process and was instantly plunged into darkness. He was feeling his way along trees, catching his ankles in roots. He kept this way up for 20 minutes crawling and creeping when suddenly he hit something hard and there was nothing. 

Barely minutes passed, and he opened his eyes. He looked to his left, and there was his torch, lying inches from his outstretched hand. He picked it up and clicked it on. Straight in front of him was a tall, thin man dressed in a pinstripe suit. Where his face should have been there was nothing except pale, white skin. His arms hung loosely by the side of his body. 

And then the torch went out.

1309478630.0	idqqf	This actually happened today. (long story)	OhJayEee	26	2	7	"I live out in the country where there's few people and a lot of trees.  Every morning I walk through the woods behind my house to get to the vineyard where I work.  The woods are already a bit foreboding, and at 6:15 in the morning, before they are properly lit, it becomes extra creepy.  I recently worked my way through the Marble Hornets series and now, whenever I walk through the woods, I'm half expecting to see Slender Man staring me from behind a tree every time I turn around.

Now, this morning as I was on my way to work, I found myself thinking of Slender Man even more than usual.  I began thinking of just how perfect the woods would be for a sighting.  I contemplated snapping a few pics to see if maybe someone on r/Slender Man could photoshop them into something particularly eerie.  I began thinking of a story I could post online about being stalked by Slendy on my morning walk.  And of course, I found myself replaying Entry 43 in my head, just to add to the creep factor.

It was at that point that I reached the creepiest part of the woods.  A long, straight trail through a thick mess of dead fir trees.  Their branches hung ominously over the trail and several had fallen into the path.  The woods stopped about 100 meters further and daylight shone out from the end of the trail, creating a tunnel like effect in the dead trees.  I trudged along the trail, still thinking about Slender Man and Marble Hornets, when I looked up and saw it.

In the light at the end of the trail was a tall, human silhouette.

My jaw literally dropped in shock and fear.  My legs froze and my heart pounded faster than I'd ever felt it pound before.  My brain was screaming at me to get the fuck out of there as fast as my leg muscles would allow.  I wasn't just scared, I was terrified.  

Then the silhouette split in half and ran away in opposite directions.  Recovering from the small coronary I had just experienced, I realized that the silhouette had not been Slender Man coming to disembowel me, but was in fact two wild deer that my overactive brain had mistakingly interpreted as an internet monster.  I caught my breath, laughed at my own jumpiness, and continued on my way.

So yeah, I thought you guys might find my little story amusing.  This was honestly the scariest thing that ever happened to me, but it's also kind of funny.  I really got into the Slender Man mythos online, but I never expected to see him in real life.

TLDR: While walking through the woods, thinking about Slender Man, I saw his silhouette and nearly pissed myself."	t5_2s4md	True

1372559875.0	1hcex4	I'm really hoping I'm just jumping to conclusions.	Confused_afraid	31	11	14	"I've been on reddit for a while, but never needed to get an account until now.

I recently saw a post from this subreddit in /r/all and it rattled me. I didn't know what I was looking at or what you were all talking about. Photos of trees in mist, some darkened road, I couldn't see anything untoward with most of them. So I looked closer and saw Him in them. I didn't realise He was this prolific and well known, I thought this was something I was only going through.  I did some research quickly online. I didn't know He was also dangerous.  

Let me explain. I'm 19, first year of college. I moved from a large city to a campus out in the country, and ever since I felt like I was being watched. Nothing too serious but had a constant chill down my neck and felt uneasy. I thought I was always seeing things in the corners of my eyes, but being a logical and rational person put it off to dust or insects. 

Then I saw Him.

 Just outside my window, about 100 yards away. Just standing there. In a black suit, red tie. Limbs that looked impossibly long but it could have just been the shadows playing tricks on my eyes. He was staring straight at me. Well, I think He was. No eyes, you see. Not that I could see. 

I stared at Him for a good few seconds before I lost sight of Him behind a bus and He was gone. It was weird. I don't remember being scared.

 I'm not sure it was Him or not and I feel I'm jumping to conclusions by asking you people for help or advice bit I just want it in case it happens to be Him. "	t5_2s4md	True

Walking by yourself 

as the world starts to grow thin

Forced to play a game 

that you know you'll never win

You know this isn't right

You can feel it in your bones

You haven't recently felt

Like you are truly alone

It won't get out of mind

You can't leave it's sight

It's watching you by day

And hunting you by night

Keep your sanity with you

It is now your only hope

In getting out alive

And getting safely home

The stars up above 

can no longer be seen

As the mist takes you in

You hold back your scream

You know he's getting closer

As your flashlight slowly dies

Darkness all around you 

Now you're clinging to your life

What is this thing that hunts you

This thing that drains your life

When will you wake up

From this terror in the night?

All you want is to go back home

But how did you lose your way?

This road you've tread 

many times before

Has now lead you to disarray 

You feel your life receding now 

On the verge of giving up 

When a kind voice behind you whispers

 ""There's no need to run""

You turn using your last strength

And don't believe your eyes

A sharply dressed man with no face

As you receive a sweet surprise

His arms extend towards you

And pick you up off the ground

Your energy coming back now

And you feel safe and sound

The sun begins to show

And the daylight hits this man

He comes up to your side

And takes you by the hand

He leads you through the woods

To the place you hold so dear

You see your house up on the hill

And away goes all your fear

You run to it quickly

Away from your new friend 

And as you approach your home

You know you are at a safe end

You turn to wave goodbye

But it seems you are too late

The man seems to have left

With no small amount of haste

You remember the night's terror 

You remember what he said

And so you enter your house

And feel a sudden dread

Everything in disorder

Everything out of place

Drawings cover the walls

Of the man without a face"	t5_2s4md	True

These two things are, quite frankly, stupid. 

- *Slender* adds nothing to the Slenderman mythos, nor does anything about the game. Please stop with it. If you would like to make posts about *Slender*, go to /r/Slender.

- We get it, Slenderman makes you shit yourself in fear at the mere thought of our favorite faceless giant, but come on,
###""*oh this stick looks like slendy I'm so scared*""
Just no, no.
Same goes for any mannequin pictures.

And just a couple of things that I wanted to say about people who make Slenderman costumes: a suit and mask does not make you look like Slenderman.    
The thing that makes Slenderman look like him is a suit and a mask, but, most importantly, height and disproportional (to the torso) limbs. So make some [DIY stilts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjcF9jKarc4) and make some fake hands/arms and make your costume look good.

##TL;DR: When you click submit, make sure you're adding something to the mythos or your creation has creative value."	t5_2s4md	True

I would have dreams, and no matter what the dream was about, he was there. The tall man, in the suit. I always felt so safe in my dreams, like nothing could hurt me. I thought he was my guardian angel. For a little bit, he came out of my dreams too. He protected me in reality. He was there when I fell off the top of the jungle gym, but no one knew how I came out without even a scrape, and no one believed me about the tall man fixing me. He was there when the guy came up and offered me candy. I wanted to say yes, but the for some reason the man ran away, yelling something about ""hes here"".  But one day, that all changed. When I was about 7, I was asleep, cuddled up with my 4 year old yellow lab, pit bull mix. I woke up at 3 am to him growling. Now I had had this dog for as long as I can remember, and I never heard him growl like this. It was menacing, and scary. I now know it was also a warning. I walked across my house, towards my parents room, which was on the other side of the kitchen. As I entered the living room, I saw him in the doorway. I could tell though, that he no longer wanted to protect me. He wanted me hurt. He wanted me gone. I screamed.



Its been almost 9 years since that night, and I still cant remember a thing after that point. According to my mom, nothing was there. She just ran in on me at 3 in the morning screaming my head off for no reason. I dont believe her though. Because I still see him, in my nightmares. I know hes still following me. And I know he'll get what he wants, because Im going to give it to him. "	t5_2s4md	True

I must have been here for a while because I can see the room around me. I am not sure how I got here but I know I am waiting, waiting for Him. The bed I am sitting on is shabby, like the room around me. Strangely, there is no inclination in my mind for sleep. I’m not tired. When I think about it though, I don’t remember ever being tired. It is just a word in my head and I wonder what it means. If it matters He will tell me. He is here. I can feel his presence on the outside of my mind, scratching and whispering.

I am in a different room now. I don’t remember coming here either. This room is nicer than the last. It looks lived in and homey. There is a photo on the nightstand of a smiling family. They look happy and I try to remember what happy felt like. I look at the bed, the couple lying there breathe quietly in their sleep. They cannot feel His presence like I can. The house groans around me, to the family it is probably a familiar noise but I recognize it for what it really is. This isn’t just a house but rather a home, a place of happiness, love, and security. That groan is it crying out in revulsion as my Master enters the door I opened. That is why I am needed, that is how I serve. He cannot enter unless the door has already been opened, those are the rules. I wonder who opened the door in my house, while I lay sleeping and my Master came. The female rolls over in the bed, she seems restless. Maybe she can feel Him, the creeping horror in the dark. The living shadow which peeled Himself from the ground or pulled Himself from whichever godforsaken pit He once resided. Actually, I think He came from the forest but I can’t remember why. She stirs again and throws the blanket back. She is starting to get up it looks like, in my mind I call for Him. He answers.

I am in a cave now. It is cool, damp, and very dark. I cannot see around me at all but I can smell the musty air and I think of caves. I wonder why that is; maybe I spent time in caves before him. A rock is digging into my back but strangely it doesn’t hurt. Hurt… This is another word that comes into my mind unbidden and I do not know what it means. The fingers on my hands are stuck together like something dried on them, hardening and gluing my fingers together. That must be the metallic scent in the air which corrupts the earthy musk of the cave. I settle my mind in to wait for him, I live to serve. I serve to live.

I am in the woods now. Leaves are crunching under my feet as I make my way along an unseen path. I wonder what I am doing. I can’t seem to control my body. In fact, I can’t remember the last time I could. There is something draped over my shoulder, it feels thin. I think it is rope. My feet come to a halt before a large, dead oak tree. I draw the rope off my shoulder and start tying a knot in it. I loop and coil and realize it is becoming a noose. I toss it over a branch some fifteen feet above me and tie off the end around the trunk. I can’t possible reach it and that branch is the lowest so I can’t climb to it. Again I wonder what I am doing, what does He want me to do? I pull a folded piece of paper from my pocket and open it. It says that someone kidnapped children and killed people. They cannot bear to live with the guilt any longer. Whose letter is this and how did I get it? This writing is familiar, did I write this letter? I pull a pin out of my pocket and stick it through the letter and then into my chest. Wait, I feel Him. He is here. I turn around as he approaches. Everything about him is… Wrong. He is too tall to be human and his edges seem to fade. There is only a blank patch of skin where his face should be. His long, thin fingers wrap around my body and effortlessly lift me into the noose. A branch of darkness from his back come around and tightens the knot. 

And then I drop.
