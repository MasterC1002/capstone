they converted him last week.        
I think my horse is mormon,        
that really makes me think.        

He doesn't drink his coffee,        
He has 27 wives.        
He wants to go to Ghana        
And save their people's lives.     

He clacks out bible verses        
With his cheery morman gait,        
And when someone tries to ride him,        
He cites Leviticus right straight.

I see him in the ghetto,        
Forgiving all the blacks,        
and though he always gives to charity,        
He never pays a tax.        

Though I cannot fully prove it,        
I know it must be true.        
I think my horse is mormon,        
and my turtle is a jew.        "	t5_2sx0d	True

When well-endowed sailors  
Gave his anal-cunt a plough

With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuus.*

~~~~~

*The Turd Not Flushed*

Two turds fell out of my ass,  
And sorry I could not flush both  
Without the plunger, long I stood  
And looked at one as long as I could  
As it floated in that noisome broth;  


Then took the other, a pubic hair  
Stuck tight against its fecal rind;  
It was like a stone, I must admit,  
As though the act of shitting it  
Had unearthed it from some anal mine,  


And both that morning equally lay  
Last night's booze had stained them black.  
Oh, I struggled to keep my gorge at bay!  
Yet as I inhaled that ripe bouquet  
I vomited forth my late-night snack.

    be slow and sensual, watching bestiality
    and make sure to eat your nut.

    Whip yourself in the back with a belt
    and pretend that Satan's your voyeur
    get naked and grind the presents under the tree
    with a dead-locked stare towards your mother.

1364266530.0	1b0opl	I found a hat.	ishatbrx	31	5	3	"    I found a hat 
    at the laundromat.
    I picked it up off of
    the hook where it sat.

    I put it right on,
    and out with a splat,
    fell a rat.

    A man came from out back
    with a flat crickett bat
    ""Gimme back that hat!""
    so I gave that shit back.

    But I kept that rat and
    found him a nice home
    with a folding couch bed
    and a cellular phone,
    set him right up
    with a rat education
    so he could break free
    from smalltime infestation.

    He learned from his peers there's security in numbers
    and now he enjoys his endeavors unencumbered.
    To protect himself from cats and dogs and all predatory things
    he tied tails with his rat friends and grew into the rat king.

    And now the rat king has learned to evolve
    and it leaves telltale signs of its presence above
    because every time you hear thunder in the clouds
    that's just the rat king while he's moving his bowels.

    So the next time you find a hat at the laundromat,
    it's best you leave it just at that,
    cause now whenever it rains,
    it's from the dick of a rat."	t5_2sx0d	True

and he threw away 

his old corn cob pipe

and he smoked a cigarette.

He began to run 

while he was dripping cum

and the cops picked up his trail.

Down to the village,
 
his cock melting in his hand,

running here and there

all around the square

yelling ""Catch me if you can!""

*

They chased him down the streets of town

right to a riot cop

who shoved a night stick right up his ass

and Frosty screamed ""Don’t stop!!!

was locked up that very day.

as he waved good bye
 
knowing he'd be back someday.

Rocking on the shitter

Then I try to shoo it away

As a low rumble begins...

It strikes a chord 

unholy this batch!

Dear god 

did something die?

QUICK I NEED A MATCH!



But its only just beginning 

this record breaking fart

Now a biblical poo	

as I make the toilet water part



Feeling like moses

And then that moment passes

As my butt trumpet chortles

with the force of a million asses



My dog begins to bark

The neighbors begin to stir

Right before I pass out

My life becomes a blur

made of porcelain,

cold as stone,

I gave my bowels a mighty heave,

as my colon filled with holes, just like a sieve.

Blood came out,

and babies too,

as I tried,

to release my poo.

I began to scream,

calling for mommy,

as there began to emerge,

last night's pastrami.

Nails in my anus,

just like a potato,

the water is red,

just like a tomato.

As I was in pain,

I shed a tear,

and the climax of my pooping,

began to come near.

It was like childbirth,

but through the way of my butt,

definitely got cut.

I cried long and hard,

as blood started to flow,

quicker than plants,

that use Miracle Gro.

My rectum yelled out,

hoping for help,

but all it could muster,

was one single yelp.

It exloded with force,

like a billion Pop Rocks,

and filled the toilet,

like gold fills Fort Knox.

I ate nails for breakfast,

just to seem tough,

but know I know,

that enough is enough.

But little did I know,

that I regenerate,

unlike you,

you stupid degenerate.

My butthole healed,

and I felt okay,

thanks to my powers,

    'One message recieved', it says with a shake,
    And a familiar ringtone.
    
    I read the text, and soon, bold-faced,
    My goals for the evening are set.
    She says 'O Lover! You must come with haste,
    If you want to get your dick wet.'
    
    I throw a shirt on, some clean pants too,
    And leave the house with a grin.
    A booty call, 'tis true, but when i'm with you,
    I have little care for the sin.
    
    With traffic on road, I start with a chode,
    But I'm at your place in an hour.
    And as thoughts of you load, I almost explode,
    My dick stands tall as a tower.
    
    As you answer the door, tired look in your face,
    And words I hoped would never be said,
    'I'm struck with a headache - I can't bang today,
    And I must retire to bed.'
    
    'What the fuck,' I think, my brow furrows,
    'Why must I respond to her calls?'
    She says I can probably come back tomorrow,
    But now I must deal with blue balls.

Who met an old pimp named Larry

Who came in his ass 

And left him on the grass 

To be fucked by his pals Tom and Harry.

__

Barry had stolen some money from a ho

And to another dumb whore did he go

Who informed in due course

Larry via code Morse

Barry's ass was due for some woe.

__

Turns out Larry pimped out both those bitches

Both of which were excruciating snitches

Larry gathered his friends

Who were real godsends

As they punished poor Barry with their switches.

__

Young Barry was ashamed in his defeat

And desired fast a good doctor to meet

But the old men were lewd

And despicably crude

Barry's ass could do nought but be beat.

Tom, Harry, and Barry finished up

And forced Larry to drink piss from a cup

The moral of this being

If old pimps are peeing

You best hurry and quickly lap it all up."	t5_2sx0d	True

Bet you didn’t know they have tails

Narwhal, blue, killer

No other fish is iller

Whales are mammals, that’s right

But unlike us, they haven’t mastered flight

Happy, sappy, crappy--all things a whale can’t be

Because man, they live in the sea

Ahab hunted one in Moby Dick

But it had no feet, so it couldn’t kick

Whales aren’t our best friends--those are dogs

Some have baleen for teeth so they can’t eat logs

We can’t tell if whales have emotions

But I can say they cause commotions

Whenever a whale washes ashore

They become part of local lore

Because it had algae on top    
And you thought it was grass.    
You apparently had a sense of smell    
Over 5,000 times as acute as mine    
And even I could smell the fucking stream        
But then you always were kind of stupid    
Even for a dog.

And bit the fuck out of my hand

I would live in a hotel, isolated at last.

I am Kubrick's nightmare brought to life. 

Crap.

The Shining exists in the one who is black.
Niggers. Hit him with axe.
Then I shall retreat and berger his ass.

My wife. She annoys me.
My son. He's so noisy.

""Redrum! Redrum!""
What the fuck does that mean?
I shall retreat and berger his bum.

""All work and no play makes me berger the ass.""

Alas, the ass could never last.
That old lady was frightening, though a randy lass.

Berger. Berger. Let me berger the ass.
Give me the bat Wendy. I must berger the ass.

Stay away from me Jack.

Ass bergers. Ass bergers. I will berger the ass.
I'm not gonna hurt ya... I will berger the ass.

    While you're out with friends at the bar

    I sit alone at the booth in the back

    Pounding drinks to make up for the courage I lack



    You are so beautiful, it pains me to see

    Your auburn hair and precious eyes

    Only remind me of things that cannot be

    Yet I watch all the same, even if you do not realize


    I may not be handsome or valiant

    Or pure of heart, yet I am somewhat gallant

    If you knew me, you may think me strange

    But I'll seem even weirder when I flash my wang


    Tables turn and women scream

    But your eyes are locked on my fuck machine

    I close my overcoat, stumbling into the night, drunk

    Finally you have seen my junk

1375942098.0	1jxuxs	Your Handy Dandy Guide to Shitty Poetry (Updated 2013-08-08)	sirsquidness	15	3	6	"Welcome to /r/ShittyPoetry! The home of the largest public toilet for poets, since 2011.

/r/ShittyPoetry is part of the [ShittyNetwork](http://www.reddit.com/r/shittyhub). All hail our overlords! You can find us in the ""Life, Culture &amp; The Arts"" section of the ShittyMenu at the top of any ShittyNetwork sub. Hah! Us? Arts? Can you believe that?

**Rules of this subreddit:**

* Standard reddiquette applies.
* No links to external content. The exception is pictures, such as a screencap of a poetic conversation on facebook. Linking to a blog post/similar is not okay. You'll have to put the image in a self post if you do post an image. 
* Be poetic. This does not mean you have to rhyme, just that you are poetic. 
* Format your poem properly. See below. 

We get a *lot* of poetry and focuses on excremental matter. You get bonus internet points if you are creative enough to beat your own path in the creative jungle. What is the story of that old guy you just walked past? How did you come to be a supermodel astronaut? What's the story behind the scar on your shoulder? 

**Moderators**
As per the side bar, we have:

* SirSquidness (me)
* anonymous123421 (We're still awaiting identity validation on this one. Apparently no one can validate the identity of 'anonymous')
* AutoModerator (Have you ever seen I, Robot? Yeah, this is the AI that got away)
* Hansafan (Fan of Hansa, resident CSS-breaker)
* raelmozo (New guy on the block, submits a lot)

No one can remember the name of the guy who started the subreddit; his account is deleted. May he rest in peace. 

**Formatting**

There are two ways to properly format your text. 

**Method 1**

*Put two spaces at the end of each line of text. This will result in a paragraph that looks like this:*

There once was a man from Melbourne  
Who had quite a nasty coldburn  
He cried and he wailed  
Until someone did impale  
That cranky bastard from Melbourne

*(I wrote that one myself!)*

**Method 2**

*Put a four spaces at the start of each line. It looks a little something like this:*

*Input:*

    I was in a band
    Got a gig at a pub
    Free beer
    It was thrown at me

*(I wrote that one too. Maybe I have a career in this?)*


**How not to do it**

Do not just put two line breaks at the end of each line

It looks horrible

And makes it harder to read

Please do it properly &lt;3

(We wont delete posts or ban users if you don't format correctly, fear not. We'd just like everyone to make the effort to make their poems look the best that they can!)"	t5_2sx0d	True
1375062230.0	1j8z67	I could stop by...	ASD_Sinfonian	15	2	4	"I could stop by that Subway,

In that Exxon station on the highway.

I could pop in, even though I know you work there.

It’s been 12 hours on the road today.

And I’m hungry.


I could walk in, cool and collected,

And order the 6-inch cold-cut combo on wheat—

No wait, uh…chicken teriyaki on flatbread.

Flatbread is the starch of champions.

I could watch you make my sandwich,

And pretend not to notice that you’re still working

In the same Subway you were working in 

Four summers ago, when we dated from early June to mid-July.


I could ask for spinach and hope you knew that

My request really meant I graduated college a year early,

And that my Chipotle Southwest sauce represents my

Master’s degree I’m pursuing.


You could tell me the price, and I could be all like, 

“$5.42? Damn, what am I, made of money?”

And you could laugh uneasily while we both stare at each other,

Knowing that the other knows what they know.


I could walk out, posture erect,

And the world you knew could crumble underneath your feet

For less than 470 calories of pure revenge perfection,

Unless I decided to get some salt and pepper.

Then it’d be over 500 calories.


Well, I could stop by, if I turn around

At this next intersection when the light changes.


But there’s that one chicken place too, just up the street.

And they have that buy-one-get-one-free deal on Tuesdays.

But it’s a Sunday. So I guess that’s not happening.

The bits zip to and fro.  
What do they mean?  
Where do they need to go?  

The processor crunches data.  
The hard drive is full of porn.  
Running programs as administrator?!?  
I think you should be warned.  

Why is it that you insist on double clicking stuff?  
Downloading free programs, screensavers, and fluff.  
Download only from reputable sites,  
And don't click on any banners.  
Remembering this is often what really matters.  

If your friend gives you software,  
And you load it on your box,  
Scan it before you run.  
Your computer will thank you a lot.  

Admin privledges give a virus power,  
To spread itself,  
and do bad stuff to your tower,  

Shift+Right-click, on installers.  
Run As... is your friend.  
Limited user for everything else,  
On this your computer depends.  

Open source programs are a safe bet,  
And won't require your money.  
Most of them are better than ones you buy,  
Which is really kind of funny.  

Computers are simple things,  
If only you could see.  
Defragmenting is like an oil change,  
This kind of speed-up is free.  

The innards can get very hot,  
And you can help them stay colder.  
Blow out your fans and motherboard,  
And your computer will live to be a lot older.  

I'm sure you clean up temporary files,  
Not doing so is a crime,  
Filling up your harddrive,  
One megabyte at a time.  

Not all the programs,  
Installed by the O-E-M,  
Are something that you might use,  
Why not get rid of them?  

Why do you insist on four gigs of RAM,  
On that 32-bit single-core?  
It just seems a bit silly,  
It can address about 3.5 of it,  
And no more.  

I'm pretty sure the savvy might notice,  
That three gigs would be mismatched.  
Upgrade to a 64-bit chip,  
If you really need all that.  

Backup your important data.  
Doing daily is not a must,  
But do you really think you'll be happy,  
When all that pirated music is suddenly lost?  

Read the dialogs that pop up,  
It's something you may need to know.  
But don't click on every one you see,  
In your browser window.  

Don't click on links in e-mail.  
It may look like it's from your bank,  
But someone's trying to phish you.  
Really? Yes, I think.  

Browse to the site the normal way,  
Type it into your browser window,  
Was it from them really?  
Now, you can surely know.  

Why do you lock down your music,  
With needless DRM?  
Be sure to check your rip settings,  
Or your music belongs to them.  

The problem is not computers,  
Or the software that's on the disk.  
The problem is ignorant users,  
Who just don't know the risk,  
Of staying ignorant of technology,  
Yet using it every day.  
User's create the problems,

Post an insulting poem and wait for an opponent. Once a challenger appears let words flow like poetic daggers until a victor becomes clear.  

Once 2 people are locked in a battle of words, refrain from joining in with poetry.  However, mocking said people is encouraged

Me and two other monks walked through the first mile.

We had 165 hats each and a cup of tea.

The melody of existence streamed gently through us,

as we realised that our mind was free.

We floated down with the balcony to our good old earth,

and met our brothers/our bad trip birth.

Flaming tricycle and a random group fight,

created a vibe that just wasn't right.

Scared we walked up the concrete rainbow lake,

thinking about the past and our personal mistake.

Horrifying absurd visions then we began to see,

scared to death, one of us finally said:

""Let's get calm by playing Tekken 3""

After that, our life was finally in peace,

for Tekken 3 slayed the fear that freeze."	t5_2sx0d	True

You’re impractical, fairly useless

But the one socket that you can always use is

Mine. It will always be there


You’re tiny and over engineered

Your beeps and whoops make my heart jump through hoops

And you’re sexy as hell, I’m aware


In real life you’re a dwarf in a bucket

But if you had a robot dick I would suck it

And if you had an exhaust port, I’d fuck it

If you’re a robot, does that make it queer?


R2D2, the robot that came from Naboo

George Lucas spent three films trying to ruin you

But he couldn’t compare - you’re my beau

And also I’d really love to be held in your strong, stubby robotic limbs

    merely unload a single tear,
    a shameful habit,

    I hope my self-destruction
    Does not continue to bore me so,
    for nobody loves me, 
    not even mother, and I asked,

    lying to myself that after this binge
    i will succeed, ever day is day 1
    until you scrap that and 
    day 1 continues tomorrow

    every single day i promise to myself
    that i will improve tomorrow

    the appearerance of diapers,
    or the trousers to lower down;
    and reveal the ugly truth, 
    a mirror no longer reveals;
    or an awful ugly crack,
    i am a 10 minute comic relief every single hour 
    of every single day, a joke to crack; 
    i do not even have the self discipline to kill myself

    into everyday situations,

    of every single defect;
    appearences are not all,
    there is my other deformities too,
    i am even more ugly than sartre 
    when She asked him what passion was,
    he tried to kiss her and she only made  her gag
    and vomit, (that is how the world shall be when I am witty)
    and poor sartre, the gold-fish
    went bumping against that world, 
    pressed his goldfish eyes against the window 
    and attempted to write literature and philosophy,
    because there might be something beautiful there, 
    and Noble gave the pity fucks of pity fucks
    and tried not to gag in nausea
    and I have measured out my wit;
    beforhand, I have mastered my defense 
    a defense of my mind at the cost of my
    body, yet no one comes to taunt; 
    so that I can affirm that my life is more than appearance
    that I am cultured, intellectually sophisticated, spirit;  
    have dreamt of places, where no mediocre talents dream,
    that I live through my thoughts, not merely exist as a body,
    yet I only dream of a single girl, not to hate me
    not to laugh in my face or turn around, to turn around  
    to the pack of hyenas who snicker and laugh,
    and will not even have me as a joke a week from now on;
    I do not even incite laughter,
    just an empty silence, 
    even silence is eager to get away,
    they watch and pity me
    soon there will not even be pity
    i will be among the daffodils,
    and dander petals across an empty grave
    as the nightingale calls,
    and my heart will not flutter,
    so do not speak, I do not hear,
    because I am not here, 
    there will be a better world,

by the heated breath

of a loving lass

or angry words from a stuttering ass




Yea oh Testes two in one, 

rocked slow, 

rocked fast

Swing set on blow

Shoots not, gold 

no auerate glow

on the curtains, woman or upon the floor




Better silver tailed ghost gasp there 

than the mud quarry well

That feeling, doesn't sit to well




The closest thing to impregnating one self

I'd say. 




Oh if my ass had ovary gloves...

I would but know the pain of my mother's love




The testes, so close, yet so far

speaking only in thumps and code

half of a whole, two of a kind

Jewels in the familial eye

The fornicator's factory of fantastic facial cream

Because you're worth it baby

Across the oceans, and across the seas

Beneath an island, nobody believes

Their eyes when they encounter a world of cheese.
 
Although some mortals have seen it, they freeze 

To death seconds later, and cease

To be. 

It’s a world that’s zero degrees

And a place full of disease, 

Because of the slowly rotting cheese. 

The sight is repulsing, the smell makes you sneeze. 

And although the world is under water, they’re still fleas

Covering the rotting corpses. There are no guarantees
 
That your brain will freeze, 

When you see the world of cheese. 

So you might be cognizant of your body being slowly eaten by fleas.



I know not of anyone that won’t agree 

That being eaten by fleas is terrible destiny. 

So if you want to avoid that fate for all eternity, 

You must not wander towards the world of cheese, 

Or else the fortune I’ll soon foresee, 

Is that of you being eaten by fleas. "	t5_2sx0d	True

your chance will come

To secretly instill awareness of tentacle freedom's dearth

Grave robbing set to BROKENCYDE's *'FreaXXX'*,

A modern-day beaut in a skin suit.

Blade skills like a Spartan,  
Jackets and skirts in psychedelic tartan.  
Cutting out a heart, and,

Going out to pick up some Doc Martins.  

Nine vulvae, in a shoebox, you say?  
A procedure so ambitious, so gynoscopic.

Isn't that kind of a Hot Topic?

And shimmied out a wallet, from which she began to shell
