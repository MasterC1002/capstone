I'm working on a project for work and need your help!

I need to find a vintage photo (something like this http://imgur.com/vmz9qbv), maybe of your grandfather (has to be a guy, sorry grandmas), showing off an awesome item of clothing from back in the day.

Here's the catch: you have to know where that item of clothing (be it a hat, jacket, army coat, whatever) is now. You also have to be able to send me both the photo and the item of clothing so we can borrow it for a promo shoot we're doing (don't worry, someone is just wearing it for a shot and it will be returned unscathed). 

In return, I will send you a bunch of our swag for your enjoyment (hint: it's awesome men's underwear)!

If you fit the bill, pm me a scan / pic of the vintage photo. I'll fill you in on all the details.

Thank you!"	t5_2ut96	True
