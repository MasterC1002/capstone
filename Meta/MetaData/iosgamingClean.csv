1371040787.0	1g6wze	Working GBA emulator, just download from site (No jailbreak required)	SplashIsOverrated	550	42	324	"https://sites.google.com/site/emu4ios/
From your phone's/ipod's browser, click on downloads and click view GBA4IOS, let it download. Now download roms (try coolrom) and click Open With GBA4IOS.
I'm running this on an iPhone 4S, 6.1.3. I'm not sure on the requirements needed.
I haven't been able to run Pokemon Yellow, possibly because it's gameboy color. I've been playing FireRed with no problems though. No lag/crashes yet, very smooth gameplay. 
I take no credit for this, just thought I'd share.





EDIT: So apparently, there are some sound issues and speed issues now and then. Still, working emulator. 







EDIT2: June 18th, 2013. It has come to my attention that this is no longer working for some. This is due to Apple revoking MacBuildServer's Enterprise certificate.

1372659586.0	1heueo	Hundreds of iOS games that don't suck	xx99	185	14	97	"Spurred by a comment in the ""let's better the subreddit"" post, I challenged myself to come up with hundreds of good iOS games.

[Here's my list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AtXD0HaWjNnCdGY1cnRnSGREem9MS2JDMDVTN2VnbEE&amp;single=true&amp;gid=0&amp;output=html). I was putting in pricing and platform data, but it was taking too much time for not being the main point of the list. I'll fill in the data later, but I wanted to get the list to you now!

In its current state, there are 217 games.

Feel free to PM me or comment below with questions about any of the games on the list or with recommendations for me to add to the list.

I don't have an iPad yet and I don't typically like racing games or first-person shooters, so iPad-exclusives and those genres are certainly underrepresented on the list. Your recommendations can rectify that!

---

Some additional comments if you feel like reading further:

* I think the massive amount of Puzzle and Strategy games is representative of both the kinds of games that work best on touchscreen and the kind of games I personally enjoy most. I also really like Platformers, but they aren't typically great on touchscreens, so I think they're probably over-represented.
* The genres are really not fair. Some of these games are extremely hard to classify and two games in the same genre are often wildly different. ""Strategy"" for OLO and ""Puzzle"" for Little Inferno feel particularly misleading, though accurate. Again, feel free to ask *any* questions.
* I'm always looking for games for my 19-month-old so if there are any great ones that your young ones enjoy, please share! There's a slew of games aimed at them and most of them, well, suck.

I've played about 600 iOS games over the past two years. If you want a recommendation, I'd be happy to give you one. Please provide the type of game you're looking for and/or a few of the iOS games you already enjoy.

---

**Edit:** The list now includes 18 suggestions from you fine folks. Keep 'em coming. I will be heavily organizing the list over the next few days so it can become even more useful.

**Edit 2:** I've added about half of your suggestions, keep them coming. It's a bit of a slow process because I'm in the middle of a move and I'm now adding content in the other columns as I add games. I have now unhidden the other columns, but you'll see they are still vastly blank.

I'm going to release this soon as a shared Google spreadsheet instead of a published one so that you guys can copy, sort, and edit it.

Will continue adding games and updating current ones. I think I'll also be adding an iTunes link for each game."	t5_2sc2s	True

I know a pretty comprehensive list exists, done by a single member, which is great, but I feel like we need something that reflects the community as a whole.

To that end, I'd like to get the ball rolling on such a list. We'll use this thread to discuss the selection process, and then in the next couple of days, I'll start a new thread where we actually choose the games.

*(For what it's worth, I reckon it'd be a good idea to use a system where each top level reply to the OP is the name of ONE game, and you upvote if you like it. Highest number of upvotes is first, and so on.)*

So, what do you think?

I could spend 4 hours playing one match on Age of Empires 2 **demo** alone. I absolutely loved it when I borrowed Starcraft from my friend and spent countless hours playing it.

Now that iOS games are so cheap and I can afford them, I feel like there's simply too many of them. I can't decide which to play and end up not properly playing any. It's like, I'll start Worms Armageddon 2 up, play for a few minutes then think: *my time would be better spent playing King of Fighters*. Then I'll switch to it and the same thought occurs. End up switching between games, not playing any and go back to Alienblue.

I've recently started designing a new iOS game using UDK (the same engine that was used to create Infinity Blade).

I've recently decided to document my process of making the game, and I figured that some people might find it interesting. Take a look:

1346722202.0	zb8qo	What iOS games do you think deserve more attention?	Wordshark	66	6	62	"I think it's time for this thread again.  What are your favorite obscure games?  What are some games that have never been featured in the app store (or were once featured but have since lapsed into obscurity), but gave you countless hours of awesome?  Or maybe if a game does get some attention, but you think it's so badass it deserves to dominate the rankings, name it here.

I feel like I should get things started, but I literally keep a text file of hundreds of mini-reviews of games I like, so I'll just pick out a couple.

geoSpark - This is a great skill/combo/whatever game by the same peeps that made geoDefense and geoSwarm.  Fans of geoDefense were pissed that it wasn't another TD, but if you take it for what it is, it's great.

Space Ninja - This is the most advanced tilt/dodge game there is.  It's like a crazy hard danmaku, but you don't shoot.  Just dodge the bullets and try to get to the end of the level.  Touch one side of the screen to slow down time, the other side to use a magnetic attractor/repulsor bomb.  Nothing in this game is random, and it's tricky trying to figure out why everything happens the way it does.  You will die over and over and over, but when you finally beat a level you'll want to cheer.  Save your replays to watch in amazement at the crazy shit you somehow managed to pull off.  Everything about this game is quality, and the spot-on controls are actually what convinced me that tilt controls can work for hard games.

Puckerz! - Get this instead of Peggle.  Ignore the stupid name (I know it sounds like a Mega Warhead flavor from 1992), this game is badass.

BloodRunner - New-school 2D platformer.  It just gets harder and harder.  Super fun.

Panic Springs - It's like a lost Atari console game.  So fun.  As I write this, I hold the #4 spot in the world leaderboards.  I want to put a star next to this one or something so you know I'm recommending it *extra hard.*

Vetica - Haha wow, this game is something else.  You take the roll of the capital A from the Helvetica font set, firing periods at waves of other letters in this intense, bizarre vertical shooter.  Tons of different weapons, including asterisk cannons, bouncing tildes, and clouds of heat-seeking commas, mean you're sure to find something that you like.  A lot of originality and creativity went into this game, and it pays off.  This isn't just a gimmick, this is a serious shooter.  Unique.

Spooky Hoofs - Another great game by Thomas Wagner, the guy that made Panic Springs.  It's like he reached into my imagination when I was ten and made a game from what he found.  This is a perfect game for Halloween.

Time Ducks - Wow, how to explain this game to someone who hasn't played it?  Ok, it's Frogger, and Flight Control, and Braid, and a slot machine.  This game will blow your mind.  It's rare to get this much innovation, complexity, and quality all in one package.

Corpse Craft - Mandatory for Edward Gorey fanatics (if you don't know who he was, you should, especially if you like Jhonen Vasquez or Roman Dirge or Tim Burton, or anyone else who marries gothic sensibilities with humor).  This genre-spanner joins Cartoon Wars-style two tower strategy, with Blowup!!-style match 3 controls for resource gathering, building units of Frankenstein monstrosities patched together from dead children, all done with fantastic Gorey-like visuals and between-levels poetry.

Perfect Cell - I have no idea how popular this game is, but it deserves more.  I love the design; you control a nasty alien, and you're killing brutal mercenary guards, and the only non-evil people in the game are the dead scientists heaped in the background.  There are some great level designs later on, and the game mechanics are just fantastic--you can split into two (and later on, three) identical, controllable creatures, your health automatically refills, and if you hold still for just a couple of seconds you turn invisible--perfect for when guards under where you're floating.  Anything by Mobigame is going to give you a good time, but I think Perfect Cell in particular deserves more attention.

What is that, 8?  I have so many more that I think deserve mention, but I'll stop myself here.

Games quickly devolve into a room full of people screaming 'adjust the tau flange!' before inevitable defeat. An absolute blast to play.

The feedback I've received has almost exclusively positive.

 However I expect many players/critics are being turned away by something, be it art, sounds, music, GUI or maybe the name is terrible!

I would love to get some people to ""tear apart"" my game and let me know what they REALLY think.

We built something pretty different.  It's not a side scrolling adventure game or a puzzle game.  It's not a word game or a drawing game.

It's an RPG where you play as a Healer casting magic spells to keep everyone alive as you face down huge raid bosses.

If you've ever raided in World of Warcraft, you'll already get it.  If not, you'll still have a ton of fun.

We launched today, and we'd love to hear what any of you think about it.

About the game (from our website):

SUGU is mind puzzling multiplayer game based on symbols. You compete against friends or random players with the aim of making as many points as possible with the tiles at your disposal. The tactical aim of the game is to place the tiles on the board in a formation that will maximize the number of points. The player who first uses all of his or her tiles ends the game. The player with most points wins the game.

Honestly, this is an unreal moment for me. My partner and I have been working on this application for two years and now that it's finally out in the wild we are so excited to see how people respond to it. When we were beta testing in the Cleveland area it was so awesome to watch people talk about taking over shopping malls, or eliminating another player from a neighborhood. I would love to see how that could take off on a much larger scale. Anyway, enough of my ramblings. I hope you guys enjoy playing this game as much as I enjoyed making it. If you have any comments or questions please don't hesitate to ask me. Thank you all so much.

*EDIT: Thanks for the great suggestions. Is there a list like this on a website anywhere? Seems like it would make a great article if it was filled out with mini-reviews.*

*It seems there are loads of turn-based games. But what if you are in the room with someone and want the 2-player experience? There must be more actual 2-player games out there?!*



**Actual 2-Player**

* Fruit Ninja
* Doodle Jump
* Super Stickman Golf
* Krazy Kart Racing
* Call Of Duty: Zombies
* Asphalt 7
* Street Fighter
* [Zombieville 2](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/zombieville-usa-2/id454781476?mt=8)
* [Draw Race 2](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drawrace-2/id433127774?mt=8)
* [Flight Control](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/flight-control/id306220440?mt=8) is fun to play with 2 players. Bluetooth and wifi support. The multiplayer mode is cooperative - you each have half an airfield and have to pass planes between screens to land the planes.
* [Autumn Dynasty](http://www.148apps.com/reviews/autumn-dynasty-review/) - real time strategy. Gorgeous and awesome stuff.


**Asynchronous/Play Against ""Ghost""**

* VS Racing 2
* Extreme Road Trip 2. Two-button racing/survival game that's F2P and has ghost psuedo multiplayer (you see your friends' most recent runs and their high score signs are in the background).

**Turn-Based**

* Words With Friends
* Word Feud
* Letterpress
* Draw Something
* Tichu
* SongPop - sort of like name that tune.
* [Zookeeper DX](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zookeeper-dx/id433596395?mt=8)
* [Disc Driving](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/disc-drivin/id402379680?mt=8) - *Disc Drivin’ is fun, social, turn-based racing! Race against your friends at your own pace with the swipe of your finger. Use awesome powers and avoid hazards on beautiful tracks with full 3D physics!* 
* Spelltower. How am I the first one to mention Spelltower? Easily the best word game on iOS, in my opinion, and the multiplayer is great.
* Carcassonne. I've got to agree with everyone else out there in that this game is amazing on iOS. I have the physical board game and rarely even use it because the iOS version is just so good.
* Outwitters. By the same folks who did Tilt To Live, this one is in the same vein as Hero Academy. Try both, as this one is F2P as well.
* [Ascension](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ascension-chronicle-godslayer/id441838733?mt=8): Chronicle of the Godslayer. This game is brilliant on iOS and I recommend it for both solo and group play. The expansion packs are even better, I think.
* Hero Academy. Free-to-play strategy game (without annoying, progress-limiting IAP) that's good for die-hard tacticians and new strategy gamers alike. I've gotten many new gamers hooked on this one.
* [Ticket to Ride Pocket](http://www.daysofwonder.com/online/en/t2r/pocket/) / [Ticket to Ride Europe Pocket](http://www.daysofwonder.com/online/en/t2r/europe-pocket/)   
* The Battle for Wesnoth
* [Lost Cities](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lost-cities/id465062454?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4)
* [Crazy Generals](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crazy-generals/id571655295?mt=8)
* Hero Academy - turn based strategy / tactics. Loads of fun, easily my favorite iOS game.
* New World Colony - turned based strategy. Sort of plays like a board game, similar perhaps to Catan. Made by a redditor.
* BANG! - western themed card game. I know there's an iPad version, not certain about iPhone...


**MMORPG?** 

* [Minecraft](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id479516143)

**Leaderboard**

* Super Hexagon. Not strictly multiplayer, but leaderboards are featured prominently. I would be surprised if multiple people started playing this and didn't compete.

With all the drama over Sim City I have got an itch for playing some on my iPad. I am looking for recommendations on what is the best, or a few of the best to consider, city sim games on iOS. 

The EA Sim City Deluxe for iPad looks like it might be the most complex offering but the recent reviews say it is broken. The other city sim games that are popular look a little too much like free to play time syncs then a premium city sim experience that I am seeking.

Games like Settlers and Civ Rev are not exactly what I am looking for but if you know of any games like Settlers that are maybe more based on development and economics than conquest I would certainly be interested.

Also, Pixel Village really catches my eye with its cool premise, carving out your village, trade and combat but it looks pretty bug ridden at the moment. If anyone knows of something similar please mention it.

At 9PM PST, I'll randomly pick 10 commenters to receive a free copy to celebrate the release. Good luck and happy playing!

Edit: Alright, the 10 keys are out! If the demand is high enough, we may do a second giveaway tomorrow night. Thanks for trying and stay tuned!

Edit 2: Since the demand got high enough, we are indeed going ahead with a second giveaway today 4/19 at 5PM PST. Head over to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1coqqy/xpost_from_riosgaming_due_to_popular_demand_we/) to enter!"	t5_2sc2s	True

I thought because it was such a huge game, it's app would be top-notch quality with no bugs and possibly frequent updates.

Nope.

* Multiplayer does not work
* Singleplayer sucks. (It's only fun in multiplayer)
* Audio is horrible, but headphones helps
* Can't customize controls
* Lack of content makes it BORING and A WASTE OF *$6.99*

What a waste of money. 

Now, a game like [NY Zombies 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/n.y.zombies-2/id534558776?mt=8) on the other hand, is worth *$6.99*

* Several Singleplayer mission modes
* Basic storyline
* Variety of zombies
* Variety of weapons
* Variety of class
* Co-Op mode for some missions 
* Survival mode which is also co-OP

Now this game has its flaws and the lack of players make the multiplayer aspect useless. But clearly it is a better game than CODBOZ, and it deserves more recognition

TheContinental	30	4	23	"After two years of working on it in my spare time, I finally submitted my first game to Apple this past Monday. I received the approval on Friday and I'm planning on 5/13/13 as my app store release date. 

I wanted to share a few promo codes with Reddit, as well as mention the giveaway I'm doing which is for $10 iTunes gift cards every day from 5/8 to my release date of 5/13/13.

Straight from the App Store Description:


When a vicious gangster upends the city’s underworld, a low level enforcer with a price on his head must fight his way through the mean streets of Trigger City on a bloody quest for revenge.

► Punch, kick, pummel, bash, maim, stab, and shoot your way across the city in 16 carnage-filled levels.

► Fight your way through 5 unique gangs, each with their own combat style, and a blood thirsty leader calling the shots.

► Unleash bone-crunching special moves to reduce your enemies to heaping puddles of gore.

► Cash in on your corpses at the Shady Dealer, where you can buy an array of illegal goods, like the… well, we can’t really talk about that here… Meet me out back.

► Speed through the streets of Trigger City on the back of a hair-raising motorcycle. Helmet laws will be the least of your worries…

► Want to spend your hard earned earth dollars on power ups and in-game currency? Too bad! No in-app purchases here, you bought the game, you get the WHOLE game!

Inspired by your favorite beat ‘em ups, and sporting a retro art style inspired by the likes of River City Ransom, Crash ‘n the Boys: Street Challenge, and more; Trigger City brings 8-bit vengeance to your iOS device.


Let me know if you have any questions Reddit!

I would like to share my indie game, [Don't Blink](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0TIXlOEbMY), with you. I made the whole thing - the coding, artwork and music - myself over the course of 8 months. Worked on it during my commute to my day job, back and sometimes into the wee hours of the night, and finally released it on April 15, 2010.

It is original, and I've always believed it to be an interesting concept. However, it never made it to being altogether very successful. Of the people who have played it, some love it and some just hate it.

I would like you to be the judge.

I hereby promise to have Don't Blink remain as free for download forever. It is my brain-child, born out of my love for scifi and colorful games. I am proud of it, and now I simply want to share it with the world.

FYI - I know there are some bugs, but I never was able to find the time to fix them (death in family, then baby).  If anyone downloads and is unable to play the game, I would totally appreciate the details around the crash.  That will help me figure things out.  Thanks in advance.

There are items you can buy in the game to enhance your experience, but by all means you can definitely finish the game without buying any of the in-app purchases.

Unfortunately, it was only made for iOS. I had always hoped to have the time to port it to Android, but I was not able to justify the time.

So, I hope you enjoy. I would love to hear your feedback. Perhaps if enough people enjoy it, I will continue to find time to dev more indie games.

If you enjoy Mario Kart, grab a couple of friends and check out the multiplayer (Race) mode. You can throw shit at each other.

Enjoy!

I work with a small team that usually makes bilingual dictionary apps.  We made a pretty great word game called ""Word for Word"" and released it for Christmas, but we got buried under all the big AAA announcements and sales.  I just want people to play and enjoy my game so here you go.

The first 100 people to [click this link](http://hooper.ultralingua.com/redeem/wordforword/IZUREP75) will get a free puzzle to play (you have to be clicking from an iPad with the app installed).  If you would like a free puzzle and the link gets all used up just leave a comment or send me a private message and I'll hook you up.  I'll stay tuned all day today to answer messages and give out codes.

Right now the game is iPad only, but the iPhone version is coming out really soon (I'm working on it right now).  It will probably be done in early January.

Here is the [iTunes download link](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ultralingua-dictionary/id574458554?mt=8) to get the (free) app.

**tl;dr**
Click link above, free word association puzzles.

------------------

Edit: The codes are all used up, anyone that wants a free puzzle just leave a comment or message me.

My first iPhone was a 3G, a few months after its release.
Back then there were very few mmos, most just the ""wait 5mins for new turns"" stuff.
Over the last few years, there's been quite a few upcoming MMOs that I had high hopes for, and played for awhile.
World of Magic, Empire Online, TibiaME, Kingdom Conquest, Pocket Legends, Order and Chaos...just to name a few.
But they all feel shallow and horrid.
Either cashshop/IAP reliant (Kingdom Conquest/Empire Online) or just not fun. (TibiaME/World of Magic)
Or completely pointless (Graal.)
Order and Chaos was good, but it was small and development is slow.

What's keeping mmos away from the platform? It feels like the device is far more then capable of running oldschool style mmos, and that there should be enough interest in them to keep one going.
Something like Ragnarok Online or Ultima Online would fit wonderfully on these devices."	t5_2sc2s	True

1371143281.0	1ga1gj	iOS Game Developers: Looking for reviews for your games? We're looking for games to review. Let's kiss -- er, work together.	neckbeardmobile	30	7	11	"**I'm reposting this with mod permission after a miscommunication resulted in the last thread getting invis'd. If you emailed me before and I didn't respond -- which I should have -- try again now.**

Greetings, /r/iosgaming redditors! I'm Evan, the publisher/editor/everything else of www.theneckbeard.com, a video review site focusing on smartphone games. 

I want to be clear up front in saying this isn't a shill post. I have mod approval so long as the topic doesn't turn into blogspam city, which is absolutely not my intent. I'd be lying if I said we won't take any exposure we can get, of course -- it's just far from my main purpose in posting.

In short: We want to foster a good relationship with relevant gaming communities and the developers who post in them. Thus far we've only looked at bigger-name titles (you can see our YouTube channel at www.youtube.com/neckbeardmobile if you're so inclined), but now that we're getting a few viewers we want to review some lesser-known, diamond-in-the-rough type titles. As a side note, I have you all to thank for a lot of our recent exposure... one of our KOTOR reviews was pretty well-received here, which kicked this whole idea off in the first place. Thank you very much for that! :) 

If you're a dev and you've got a game you'd like us to review, feel free to message us here or email us at theneckbeardgaming[at]gmail.com. Ideally you'd send us the following info:

* A download code if the game isn't free-to-play,
* An MP3 of your title screen music or some other music from your game for us to run in the background, and
* Written permission to monetize the review (or a note asking that we don't).

We understand that third point is especially hairy. If it helps explain, we're finding we get a lot more direct traffic on the YouTube channel than the site itself, which is where most of our monetized content is. It's a CYA from YouTube's rules, since they're not very nice to reviewers who monetize fair-use game footage if the developer complains. We ONLY monetize with permission, and your decision will have **ZERO** impact on the score we assign your title. We aren't dicks like that. We promise.

Our end goal is turn the stuff devs send us here into a kind of ""hidden gems found on Reddit"" feature. We posted a similar thread in /r/AndroidGaming that was VERY well-received (about ten dev requests so far), and we intend to review every title sent our way. 

That's pretty much all we've got. If you're not a dev but know of some good, lesser-known titles, especially board and puzzle-style games, please let us know. We're also always dying for feedback... if you see anything you 
don't like in any of our stuff feel free to drop us a line and let us know what we can do better. We promise not to flip our shit like that art class critique video that made the rounds a few weeks ago. That broad was crazy. 

Thanks again, ladies and gents. Your kind and/or constructive comments (here and on the channel) really got this idea off the ground and gave us a fresh shot of motivation to produce quality content for our channel. With your help we can make even more -- and make it even better. 

Sincerely,
Evan 

(PS - I know you're not supposed to sign your posts or whatever but it felt like the right thing to do here. Sue me.)

1343832486.0	xi9yl	Wanted: Beta testers for a gameplay mechanic in an upcoming story-based puzzle adventure game about conspiracies, teenage injustice, and breaking into stuff.	Keric	22	1	13	"Tester signup URL (TestFlight): ~~http://tflig.ht/OlD8Dl~~

Lightborne Lore's website: http://www.lightbornelore.com

The mechanic being tested is a simulation of cracking a combination lock.

It may sound odd, but this prototype has no instructions. We want to see how long it takes players to figure out the gameplay (your time will be sent to us).

We've built a feedback form into the app with a few questions and a field for comments, so please leave any feedback there. Thanks a ton, Reddit!

EDIT: 11 testers already! Thank you so much! We'll be submitting a build in two hours, to make time for more volunteers (it's currently 2:20pm EST).

EDIT 2: Alright, 14 awesome volunteers! We're uploading the build, and will add you to the adhoc profile. You will receive an email with more information. If anyone else signs up, you'll be part of Round Two.

EDIT 3: A few responses so far with great comments. Good or bad, keep the feedback coming! A big thanks to everyone that signed up for this test. We have all that we need for now, so we shut the link down, but there are more mechanics to test (and eventually the full game). Keep an eye out for more opportunities!

EDIT 4: *Those of you in Round 1 who haven't sent feedback yet*: if you have the time, please let us know what you think! It will really help us to get as many answers as possible. We'll be reopening testing very soon to make sure that we have a large enough sample, so stay tuned. I'll PM anybody who requested it!

*For anyone interested in our development/prototyping process:* We'll be posting the results of our test (insight gained, changes made because of feedback) here once we process everything.


**EDIT 5: The promised feedback!** Sorry it took so long to get back to you about this. We are prototyping multiple projects at once, and we're just now getting around to this project again.

With this prototype, we set out to test...

* The popularity of the game's premise (based on the title of the post, and, to a lesser degree, our website content)
* Will knowledge of real combination locks transfer to this prototype? Is any explanation necessary?
* How long will people play? This was tracked in the app.

We asked the following questions in a post-app survey:


* How is it? (Frustrating, Boring, Alright, Fun)
* How is the level of challenge? (Too easy, Appropriately challenging, Too hard)
* Would changing the combination length be an appropriate way to vary the difficulty? (Y/N)
* Would you play a story-based game that relied heavily on this mechanic? (No, Yes: free app, Yes: paid app)

We received a really positive response based on the post title. About 20 volunteers in just a few hours! Great validation of our core concept. However, we only had 8 people respond to our survey.

Of those who responded to the survey, 5/8 thought the experience was frustrating. Though the sample size was small, it's obvious that some explanation is needed. Many players requested audio feedback (like a click when the notch in the wafer reached the correct digit), but we may not implement this. We WILL find a way to teach how to play, but I don't want to reduce any challenge into a ""listen for the click, rinse, repeat"" mechanic. I'm excited to test our next iteration!

6/8 testers said they would not play a story-based game that relied on the current mechanic, but the other two said they would not only play, but pay. I'm also curious to see if our next prototype changes this response.

Several testers did not respond to the combination length question. If you can't figure out how to play the game, you won't know how to make it more or less difficult.

Finally, based on the 8 survey responders, the average time spend playing the prototype was about 7.5 minutes. Three of those responders abandoned the prototype without successfully cracking the lock.


Overall, we were able to get great feedback on our two core objectives. Thanks so much to those who offered to test our game, and I will absolutely PM anybody who asks me to participate in our next test! Much love iOSgaming, much love."	t5_2sc2s	True

I guess this is just a little rant really... but it doesn't seem there are enough developers taking advantage of iCloud - Especially for games that are universal over iPad and iPhone.

I recently got an iPad, and I love it - But there just aren't enough games that support save games over the cloud. For example, I have recently been playing Fifa 2012, and enjoy it on my iPad... however, it is universal and so I can play it on my iPhone. Despite the screen real estate, I actually don't find it too bad to play on the iPhone - But this is regardless, it could be any game I'm talking about. But it would be nice to just play where I left off on the iPad, on the iPhone...

I just looked at the apps that are syncing things over iCloud on my iPhone, and there are only three apps: Pocket Planes, Todo &amp; Doodle Jump. Just seems bizarre that there aren't many more apps here. Another example, is Jetpack Joyride. I'm freakin' addicted to this game, but the scores and ranks aren't synced over iCloud, so I have a different top score and different rank on my iPhone and my iPad.

Anyone else with me on this?! Can we get our developers embracing the iCloud?! :P Huzzah!"	t5_2sc2s	True

It's extremely difficult to make a videogame when you have to work to pay your bills but here we are.


I know puzzle casual games are quite washed up but we did our best. We love pixelart and old fashioned school and that's why we did a good effort to make the look and feel that way.


The lite version of the game is free for iOS. The only version in fact, there's no full version yet. For now it's only available for iOS.


Part of the process of making a videogame is to learn from results. So, in order to make worth the effort, we want you to give us your feedback.

I had never played a Magic game in my life and decided to give this a try.  It's a LOT of fun.  There are a lot of people that play it, so there is no shortage of players to be matched with on multiplayer.  Has anybody else noticed though that it seems everybody is a sore loser?  Every time I come close to winning, my opponent quits before the end of the game.  It's really not that big a deal because I still unlock cards and get credit for the win.  It's just cooler if your opponent sticks through it and maybe even goes for a re-match.  That is all.  Done ranting.  My screen name is mkmoore86 if any of you want to play.	t5_2sc2s	True

You look to your right as a regiment of peasants hold the line against a horde of skeleton warriors, giant armored captains behind them... on your left two ally giants smash their clubs into a goblin horde, knocking them 20 feet back in all directions. Behind you dwarven riflemen and archers unleash salvo after salvo of ranged fire into a monstrous troll as he lumbers forward, intent only on smashing your castle to splinters. With your army faltering, you decide to take matters into your own hands, your heroes battle prowess worth a hundred ordinary soldiers... This is the idea behind Heroes and Castles! 

[Youtube Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnpPehZKE7E)

What is Heroes and Castles? Well, its an incredibly ambitious 3rd person action/strategy/castle defense/RPG hybrid that we think captures the essence of a huge medieval fantasy battle like no other mobile title before! We've gotten great feedback so far from sites like TouchArcade, many calling it one of the best iOS games they've played.

We're a small indie team - 4 brothers actually, if you can believe it :) - and would love it if you could just check the game out. I know reddit is a powerful community and so many have asked for this and that, but we don't think we deserve a handout or anything like that. We just think Heroes and Castles is a great game and would love for you to give it a look! If it looks like something you're into, make no mistake we'd very much appreciate the support! Thanks everyone.

You manage a team of four heroes (you can hire more but only four can be controlled at one time) and have them train, research items and equipment, change costumes, fight crime, and improve your base. I've played for about six hours and it's still lots of fun.

We at Broken Kings are working on releasing Castle Conflict 2, a strategy game for iOS (iPhone/iPad and also Mac) where the goal is to defeat the enemy castle before they defeat you. The strategy comes from needing to control the resources in the middle of the battlefield, combat that resolves immediately (goodbye big mess in the middle of the field), a second lane of attack with flying units, and the ability to customize any army of 8 units. We're hoping to go live with the first campaign in September.

I'm pretty stoked about this because we made the first version of this game three years ago, before iPad, Retina, Game Center, etc... existed so now we get to take advantage of all that stuff + the stuff I've learned since + the beautiful art of Sean Dunkley to make it better than it ever was before.

At present we have 8 of the units implemented as well as the online multiplayer. [You can see some of our progress here](http://www.BrokenKings.com)

We are looking for a couple of things at this point:

1. We are looking for a couple of beta testers - not a lot - if you are interested, let me know :)

2. We are also [looking for some funding](http://www.indiegogo.com/cc2) - mostly to pay for our audio guy, and artist. We set our goal a bit high in the hopes we'd get enough money to do some advertising as well, but it's looking like we probably won't quite reach that amount. If you guys are able to donate at least $5, you will get the first campaign map for free when the app comes out, $10 yields you every campaign map ever (however many that ends up being), $20 yields you an exclusive unit that will only be available to people who help crowdfund the game. Please note that the $5 and $10 reward do not currently specify that you get the campaign maps, and due to a bug with the IGG website I haven't been able to update these to specify this.

1340232223.0	vcp3m	Tried to make the longest Plague, Inc. game possible.  	pianowow	25	8	16	"By now I've beaten the game on brutal on every disease type, so I wanted to amuse myself a little with the cheats.  I used the immune cheat, so humanity could never cure the disease.


The limit I put on myself was to never evolve any symptoms.  In fact, until I had infected everyone on the planet, I devolved every symptom. 


2012: game starts on Brutal, disease name: God.  I evolved air and water, drug resistance.  After seeing Greenland and Canada only get 1 infection every few days, I finally get cold resistance.

2025: I had infected everyone on the planet, so time to stop devolving symptoms.  I also devolved the air and water transmission types, and started buying the transmission types which increase the mutation rate.

2029: with only one symptom (cysts), my first death appeared.  I got 2 deaths in Ukraine.

2035: first lethal symptom appears, pulmonary fibrosis.  Four countries bomb their cities, quickly shooting the death total to 5% of the world population.  Those governments fell pretty quickly after that.  

2063: Still only 5% killed, my second lethal symptom was evolved, pulmonary oedema.  Deaths go from 5-7k per day to 110-250k.

2077: 18% killed, my third and final lethal symptom was evolved, inflammation.  Deaths rise to 520-980k per day.

2094: 75% killed, almost all governments fall within the next year.  The only two to survive are Greenland and Madagascar.  Deaths skyrocket to 5-7m per day.

2096: 99% killed, the last two governments fall, Madagascar right before Greenland.

2097: The last human is killed in Greenland.


85 years!  I probably could have been a lot slower infecting everyone.  Maybe I'll do this again some day.


The game took several days of me playing for a few hours at a time.  [Here's an album of screenshots.](http://imgur.com/a/zKbVr)

I have played lots of RPG games lately, but I need more cause I've got kinda bored of these ones (and finished almost all). Some titles that I've enjoyed are: Zenonia 3 &amp;amp;amp; 4, Infinity Blade I &amp;amp;amp; II, Blood Brothers (it's nice and Pokemon-like), Avatar Fight, Wild Blood, Order and Chaos (too slow leveling), Dungeon Hunter 2 &amp;amp;amp; 3 (3 was extremely lame compared to 2) and Squids.

I am a bit finicky when talking about RPG games: I want them to have a bit of graphics as well (I know that this isn't as important as the gameplay and storyline but that's how I like them).

The price doesn't matter at all cause I've got a 50 $ gift card, but I don't really like the games in which the ones who buy in-game currency / special currency are highly favoured.

Do you have any suggestions for me?

Thanks a lot for your suggestions :). I'll edit this post and leave review for each of them when I get home :D.

I'd like to find a turn-based strategy game for the iPad to occupy my brain for a bit.

What I am looking for:

- raster graphics (bouncy vector cutesy stuff I find annoying)
- medieval theme or something tasteful
- I don't want to be overwhelmed with stuff to buy/upgrade


Stuff I have liked so far:

[Warlords Classic HD](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/warlords-classic-hd/id532024361?mt=8) Beautiful remake of the original

[UniWar HD](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/uniwar-hd/id311456818?mt=8) Enjoyed the artwork

[HighbornHD](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/highborn-hd-lite/id389422026?mt=8) This is a very good game but tests my limits at times with the corniness

[Tank Battle:1944](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tank-battle-1944-lite/id514573436?mt=8) Good game, is it deep enough?

[Osmos HD](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/osmos-for-ipad/id379323382?mt=8) Ambient plus ethereal

[Heroes Blade](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/heroes-blade-lite/id399875831?mt=8) Beautiful game, the card system got a bit complex

[Flower Board](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flower-board-hd/id450677428?mt=8) Phenomenal

[Treasures of Montezuma](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/treasures-montezuma-hd-lite/id390141724?mt=8) Gem game but beautiful


Stuff I have not liked for whatever reason:

Izar-Origins

Palm Kingdoms Classic (sadly was only iPhone size and uninviting; did not want to invest in iPad v2)

Civilization Revolution (The ""sims"" graphics style I find very distracting)


On my list to try:

[Padd Trek](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/padd-trek/id412782761?mt=8)

[Metal Brigade](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/metal-brigade-tactics-lite/id413721712?mt=8)

[Battle for Wesnoth HD](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/battle-for-wesnoth-hd/id369563335?mt=8) Briefly played


Is there a better place I could post this? If so just let me know.

To start:

It actually features LESS music. The music on the original was a lot better. It's basic basically the same, but with less sounds.

The gameplay is the exact same to. They added a few new condos, which is cool I guess, but should have just been an update to the original, or at least an in application purchase. 


The game is circled around pay to win bullshit. They added a prize wheel to the end of each 2 minute game, (Did I mention no more endless mode?) which gives you coins for the most part.

You can spend the coins in the store on the main menu. As soon as you press the store button you are cluster fucked with a bunch of in app purchase options. Then you have the choice of buying stupid fucking hats that multiply your score. 

All in all, I still love the game, but its more than a minor update rather than a sequel.

The games generally require no 'hidden' pieces or things in your hand, and turns usually require some number crunching, which the iPad could automate.

Unfortunately, the genre seems too niche to see a presence on the iPad. Does anyone know of any wargames that have been made (or ported) for iOS?

However, the RTS elements drive me nuts sometimes. I just can't get into RTS games as much.

I'd love to find a multiplayer/clan based game (or something that has a decent social element), that involves either RPG character development or something akin to D.O.T., where you improve your character/party by fighting other players.

I know this sounds specific, but I'd love some suggestions! I'm not hellbent on everything I listed, and I'm willing to shell out a few bucks for an initial purchase to avoid games that are IAP heavy.

Now I'm in full-on download mode, and it's struck me that there are a few types of games I'm looking for that I don't seem to see on the App Store.  Maybe some of you can help me out.

I'm looking for:

- A good tactics-based, ""customize your party"" western RPG in the vein of the old Ultima games, or something like an iOS version of the newer Dragon Quest games.  Turn-based like Ultima, or more micromanagey like Dragon Age: Origins, ideally...

- Something like Sid Meier's Civilization 4/5 that has more complexity than the 6 year-old Civilization Revolution.

- More one-on-one turn-based strategy games like Hero Academy 

- A city simulator that isn't a FarmVille clone- something closer in playstyle to CitiesXL or Tropico

- Atmostpheric puzzle/exploration games- something like Myst or Riven

Any suggestions for any of these?

*If you have trouble understanding the instructions, please let me know why so I can improve them.*

Instructions:

* Color matches are shown using horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines between circles.
* A move is made by selecting one of the seven columns.
* A color match with one or both of its circles in the selected column will be “activated”.
* When selecting a move, keep your finger down to see which matches will become activated for the various columns.
* In an activated color match, the following will happen:
  * the first and last circles of the match will shrink
  * any circle in between will turn to the color of the match unless there is a conflict with another activated match in which case the circle will turn or stay white
  * any unoccupied grid square in between will create a largest sized circle of the color of the match unless there is a conflict with another activated match in which case the created largest sized circle will be white
* When a stack of circles lands, it will be automatically selected with behavior as above for a selected column provided that the landing is not an immediate result of a circle being created directly underneath."	t5_2sc2s	True

For the past year, the devs have been almost completely absent. There are bugs that need fixing and people are losing interest slowly and leaving. It's a space based mmorpg with a real economy. Units, mats, blueprints, energy sources are sold. Every four days wars are fought. It's a great, unique game, but without new players and lack of support from the developers, it's dying. We desperately need some help. New players would be great, but I'm looking for someone that would be willing to get the game away from the current developers (SMLSD) (who we have been unable to contact, but know are still around as they do make contact with the players of cartel wars) and help us start anew.

1365429333.0	1bx0s6	My dilemma; Universal App or two versions each under 50MB?	hey_suburbia	18	4	20	"I've worked really hard to make my iOS game work on all devices (Universal including iPad Retina graphics, iPhone 5 version) and despite my best efforts I'm only able to get the game down to 100MB.  


I wanted to have the game for sale for 99 cents and be universal.  The idea was to push the idea of No IAP, No Free/Light version, No HD version, just 99 cents and free updates for all devices for life.


I've read a dozen forum discussions regarding the 50MB or &lt; argument/issue and I'm really struggling on how to proceed.  If I made an iPhone version and a iPad version I'd be able to get them under 50MB, but then I'd be asking the user to buy it twice if they have multiple devices.


The game is a casual game, but I put a lot of effort into the two player co-op and two player VS modes, so I feel my game will be shared by those who have it and want their friends and family to go up against or play with.  The game is very easy and challenging at the same time, so I feel my target audience is very young to very old.  I started thinking about school kids trying to play the game at recess with their friends and not being able to download it because it's 100MB.  

I've really been struggling with this decision and I'm leaning on Reddit for some advice.  Personal opinions are welcome and I'd really love to hear from somebody that may have actually tried it both ways.

To make things a little more intense, I only have 30 days left to upload my binary or else I lose the name/leaderboeards etc...

Two reasons I'm asking:
1. I want an easier way to find games than browsing the App Store (forget it) or looking through news sites.
2. I'm willing to build it.

1364590764.0	1b9jh7	[Punch Quest] 150,000 punchos in 15 minutes	msaleem	13	1	3	"I was playing Punch Quest and I realized that the game gives you x amount of punchos every day for sharing your score when you die. It was 3,000 yesterday, 4,000 today, and so on. I realized that by changing the date, I could keep getting more and more by simply dying (you don't even have to die, exit game, change date, enter game, click shop, click back, and share again and repeat the process). It keeps increasing till you're getting 10,000 punchos per share. 

In a matter of 15 minutes I managed to get 150,000 punchos from the game. That's the interesting part. 

Now whenever I die in the game, the game tells me I owe the gnome a time loan of 150,000 punchos and it just keeps subtracting whatever I earn per run from the total. So it was good in that I was able to buy a lot of stuff, but fair in that I have to repay the loot. "	t5_2sc2s	True
