From a very young age, I was taught to play golf every weekend and learn teeist doctrines and ideas.  As I went through college and learned to think for myself, I realized that my ideas of golfing weren't *really* my own; they were just my parents' ideas impressed and even forced on to me.  With the help of people on this subreddit, I began my path towards ateeism, which leads me to my complaint:

When I first became an ateeist, this subreddit was full of thoughtful and insightful posts and comments.  But now it just feels like a circlejerk of anti-teeism and people bashing golf.  Don't get me wrong, I do think that golf is destructive and wrong.  But I miss the  community we used to have full of thoughtful, insightful posts rather than angry memes and image macros.

/r/nongolfers used to have plenty of quality discussion about ateeism and living without golf, but lately there has been a huge influx of memes, rage comics, and facebook posts that pander straw-man fallacies and faulty logic that essentialize and demean teeists - and I can't get behind that. Sometimes I feel like this subreddit is only populated by angsty teenagers that only want to vent their anger and feel superior to golfers.

Can't we get back to more meaningful discussion about our beliefs? This subreddit has basically become /r/circlejerk

I all hate golfers as much as you do, but the rest of reddit just doesn't take us seriously without discussion about how much we like to not play golf. 

I propose we ban all image and blog posts, and have self posts only. This will stop the recent blogspam I've been seeing here, and hopefully prevent karma whores from cashing in on this subreddit. Additionally, we could create extra subreddits where fellow non-golfers can post things like memes and facebook screenshots to their heart's content.

I wasn't raised in the US and golf doesn't really exist in my country so it never occurred to me just how hard it might be for nongolfers in other countries.

Since visiting this subreddit, I've become much more aware of just oppressive it is. I can't imagine how horrible it must be to have to drive past golfcourses every time you go home. I have no idea how disgusting it must be to have television shows and channels dedicated to golf. The very notion that your politicians and businessmen are mostly dedicated golfers who have ""meetings"" on the course while discussing the laws and businesses they intend to put in place is just ludicrous to me, as is the idea that people may feel pressured into the sport just to fit in with them.

Personally, I feel incredibly blessed to have been born into a third world country where these issues simply aren't a problem at all.

The object of this game? Take a hot, boiling pot of spaghetti, drain it, and use your spaghetti ladle to fling the spaghetti into a simmering pot of tomato sauce that is 100 yards away!!! Then, take out some fresh meatballs out of the oven and fling them into the pot!!! Best part? You have a nice meal when you're done!! It serves a rational purpose unlike illogical golf.

OK guys, you figured me out. This is not a serious game, it is obviously a parody of golf and how ridiculous and stupid it is. I'm SOO incredibly clever and that's why I thought of it! Seriously guys, flinging spaghetti is basically no less rational and has just as much scientific basis as hitting a ball into a hole. The only reason it sounds more ridiculous is that golf has been around so much longer and people are conditioned to accept it from birth. Now, on Sunday morning, when mom and dad say they're going to go to hit the links, you can tell them you are going to play flying spaghetti ball. They'll probably find it appalling and unacceptable because of their social conditioning, but they just don't understand what it's like to be a 16 year old in modern society.

Now, on facebook, under the 'golf preferences' line, instead of putting that you don't golf, you can put FLYING SPAGHETTI BALL!!!! Stick it to the man, hell yeah!

Now, on your back bumper, instead of putting a bumper sticker about how you hate golf that will surely get your '97 subaru outback keyed, you can put that you love to play FLYING SPAGHETTI BALL!!!! Only the COOL, INTELLIGENT people like us will get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ~~God,~~ I'm so clever, I amaze even myself.

Stay snarky san diego!!

EDIT: I am working with nongolf leaders Richyard Dogleg and Christopher Ditchens to establish the Professional Flying Spaghetti Ball Association. In addition to the nationwide tour we're planning, the PFSBA Tour, we're going to do some ironic advocacy work, just to piss off ignorant, scorecard-thumping teeists. (Snicker) We're going to get congress to recognize us as an actual sport, protest high schools until they create a school Flying Spaghetti Ball team, etc."	t5_2u95f	True

Anyway, I work in a corporate environment. I'm pretty much surrounded by golfers (it's all they ever talk about). My boss and our co-workers like to go to the driving range every Friday night. Usually, I make up some bullshit excuse so I don't have to join them. But last week, I became overly trusting. I decided to go with them.

I watched them take a couple of shots when my boss asked me if I wanted to join in. I told him that I didn't. Suddenly, my co-workers started cheering me on. My boss lifted me up (he's about a foot taller and 100 pounds heavier than me), placed a golf ball right in front of me, and shoved a golf club into my hands. My co-workers all started cheering ""take a swing"". 

My boss moved in behind me, breathing down my neck...told me to ""get into position"". Then he stood back and told me to hit the ball. 

So I did.

I haven't been back to work since then. I haven't told my wife about any of this; when I stare into her eyes all I see are two golf balls looking back at me.

It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my 12 pack of Mountain Dew for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didn't have enough for her groceries and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $0.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my soda to the cashier, handed him a $5 and told her to keep the change. One of the middle aged women (I knew these people, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly, ""See that man? He's acting just like a golfing person should."" For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking some nice scruff, a Slayer shirt, and gym shorts, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said ""Golfers? Ma'am I'm an ateeist who makes minimum wage and I was the one who stepped up to help her? Your hypocritical country-club attitude is an inspiration to us all."" As I stormed out, a couple of the cart boys started to whistle and cheer, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier. I gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment. "	t5_2u95f	True

In my philosophy class, we were talking about fairness and punishment and the example this guy decides to use it Tiger Woods from this weekend. Of all the examples of punishment to choose from, he uses Tiger Woods.

I felt so alone when he asked who was familiar with the situation. I was the only one in the class who didn't know. I felt so ashamed of being an ateeist. 

I left my small town to avoid this persecution. I was tired of driving past the 3 golf courses on my way home every day and I thought coming to a major university would change that. Turns out this campus is as backwards as my hometown.

Salivanth	119	21	78	"So it seems to me that you guys like to demonise golf and golfers, just because we think it's a really, really fun sport and that you all should be playing it. So I'm here to break these misconceptions, once and for all. Prejudice comes from ignorance, and you are all clearly ignorant of our ways.

I grew up in a golf household, briefly flirted with ateeism as a teenager, and then became a professional golfer just like my father when I realised how much better it was to play golf than not to play it. For the last twenty years I've travelled the country playing in golf tours, and being an ambassador for this, the greatest game on Earth. I have a loving teeist wife, and two beautiful teeist children with another teeist on the way. I have seen first-hand how much golf enriches people's lives, and I want you all to have that same joy. I am an embodiment of how much golf brings to a person, to a family, to a community, and to a nation.  If you've got a question about golfing, I can answer it.

And yes, this is an AMAA, but don't let that think I'm going to avoid the hard questions. The extra A is just there for...insurance purposes. Yes. That will do.

EDIT: Nobody's asked anything in a few hours, and I'm going to bed in a couple of hours anyway, so I'm going to end the AMAA here. Thanks for your questions."	t5_2u95f	True

We practically have no rights whatsoever besides the right to go to jail or be hanged or beheaded for our blasphemy.
But the voice of millions of ateeists like all of you would significantly help us. It brings into world attention our plight, and all the horrible things Minigolf is responsible for, and how it has oppressed and destroyed many of our lives. It would at least help change some laws that would benefit us ex-mini golfers.
I heard that Ayaan Hirsi Ali (an ex-minigolfer) has replaced Woods as the one of the Four Horsemen of New Ateeism. Maybe this is a cue that we need to concentrate more against the Religion of Mini Golf?"	t5_2u95f	True

1341759100.0	w80ki	True story about my real GF's (non-golfing) family get-together is Sweden. Why can't the rest of the world be this way? 	Sparnmer	84	13	7	"There's a common misconception among the golf-infected that nongolfers are bitter, cynical social outcasts who rage at Ernie Els from the darkness of their parents' basement. How can anyone be in shape without walking 4 miles in 4 hours, or some other primitive “recreation” of ancient history?


So here I am, reporting from a typical festivity among my real nongolfer-since-birth girlfriend's family and their friends.


A couple from her family, a cousin and her husband, are hosting a family reunion. About 60 people were invited. I showed up anyway.


Their get-together had taken place in Sweden, so it was a secular affair. The state had mostly disapproved of golf; not that I approve of this totalitarian heavy-handedness, but it brought forth a generation of Swedes who had no use for Golf.


Festivities involved good food, alcohol, music and some other fun &amp; games that you'd associate with a typical extended-family celebration. It could have been just like in the US, except all evening long no one ever mentioned Tiger Woods or Phil Mickelson. Nobody else seemed to care about it at all, **as though it wasn’t the most important thing in the world! Like they didn't define themselves solely by this!** Except for one guy, and that guy was me. **:)**  I had to ask everybody: ""how many golfers do you think are here?"" Despite most people replying “what does this have to do with anything going on here?”, I persisted and finally got my real GF's father to agree that given the Swedish setting, the number must be below 30%. ""Of all the couples we know here, only one even tried mini-golf, and they gave up at the hole with the windmill"" .


The hosting couple are decent, hard-working people. She runs a pub/restaurant, (I heard it's nice, but I'm not allowed in), he's a social therapist working for a rehabilitation center for trauma victims. They're well respected in their community, their love for each other is obvious, and they've raised a couple of bright, good-natured kids with promising futures. These folks are kind and upbeat and, like their friends, would give the shirt off their backs to someone in need. They also really know how to have a good time. For some unknown reason they don’t like me.


This is just an long-winded anecdote, of course, but it's fodder for some thoughts: are these folks missing anything? What does a golfer have that they don't? A silly looking bag full of sticks and balls? A neck with no beard? Seriously, who needs that? What good does it do, does it make people even better? Does it guarantee living a longer life? Well, here's the thing: any person willing to submit to eternal torture by playing a silly game would be untolerably stupid. Personally, not only do I not believe in playing such a crazy and evil game, but I'm seriously concerned about the sanity of anyone who would.  

If you play your cards right, then for you American Redditors this could be your future: a community/country where few people care about Golf, probably mostly for reasons of nostalgia and inertia; and where those beliefs are held so privately that nobody mentions them in public, let alone votes them into new public parks. Where effective phys ed and science are taught in schools and healthy living is not made to run gauntlets. Where people do stuff that keeps you in good shape rather than golfing.

Edit: I am a 52 years old , was born in the US, and have lived in Sweden for the last 41 years, and still use my US passport.

Got applause.	cbfw86	83	11	6	"So I was standing in a rather large line at my local Wal-Mart today behind a couple families that I know from when I went to the golf course with my family in year younger. It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my 12 pack of Mountain Dew for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didn't have enough for her groceries and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $0.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my soda to the cashier, handed him a $5 and told her to keep the change. One of the middle aged women (I knew these people, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly, ""See that man? He's acting just like Tiger Woods wants us to."" For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking some nice scruff, a Slayer shirt, and gym shorts, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said ""Like Tiger Woods? Ma'am I'm a non golfer who makes minimum wage and I was the one who stepped up to help her? Your hypocritical golfing is an inspiration to us all."" As I stormed out, a couple of the cart boys started to whistle and cheer, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier. I gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment."	t5_2u95f	True

Well, the night before, my wife and I eat some funky tasting Mexican food, and she gets sick, vomiting her guts out Saturday morning and leaving me to go golfing ALONE with her parents.

Needless to say, the whole day was spent snickering when they yelled ""fore!"" or debated which club was best to use (as if there is one best one).  I'm pretty sure one of the servers was a nongolfer like I was, because he kept catching me laughing when he would bring us drinks and join in.  The best was when my father-in-law said something about being a 'high handicap' and the server (who I found out was named Brian) whispered ""if he's a golfer, he's definitely mentally handicapped!"" 

Oh man, it ended up being a great day.  Stay strong, fellow nongolfers!"	t5_2u95f	True

1355168645.0	14mbnn	A terrible story I must tell you.	TrindadeDisciple	74	9	15	"First of all, I live in a family comprised largely of teeists. My father, his father and brothers, and my male cousins, my stepmother and half of her family, and even my late mother's brothers and their sons are all hardcore teeists. I married an ateeist, luckily, but her brother and brother-in-law are also hardcore teeists. So there's always a ton of snide comments about our lack of golfing, particularly mine as a man. Well, at Thanksgiving we were in Dallas to see my mother's side of the family, and my aunt suggested we go to a place called ""Top Golf."" I managed to mask my revulsion and asked if there would be beer and snack foods. She showed us the menu and we agreed to tag along so we wouldn't be sitting at home alone.

The place was enormous and lavish (as most golfers like their courses and ranges to be... just go to any country club), three floors of bowling alley-like stations where you tee off from. You drive the ball toward various pits in the ground, a chip in each golf ball recording its location and adding points to your score based on where in a particular pit your ball lands. Really, a way to get people who aren't interested in traditional golf to still put clubs in their hands. Disgusting, really, but I thought I might play along with this little game. I figured that, since there was a pit about fifty yards out, I'd get a swing of sorts down that would consistently get the ball in that pit and beat the teeists at their own game. 

After a while of consistently getting points while my hardcore teeist family members were trying to emulate tIGER wOODS and drive the ball two-hundred-plus yards and missing the targets most of the time, I step up once more to the tee. Now, I'm a former football player, and I still have broad shoulders and large muscles. My cousin says ""Man, if you could just your form right, you could send that ball forever."" 

Unable to take any more, I slowly turned around and pointed a finger at him. I yelled at the top of my lungs, ""I don't need to be able to able to hit a ball anywhere, for any distance, to have a sense of self-worth. If you want to keep playing this game invented by sheep-herders in Scotland, keep at it, but count me out!"" I raised the club high and then broke it across my knee, throwing the pieces one-by-one out into the target where I'd been hitting the ball. Without another word I stormed out. The people at the tee next to us began to slowly clap, then the bartender and the DJ began to clap, then the entire floor we were on began to clap. As I was leaving the building the owner himself was clapping."	t5_2u95f	True

1350375758.0	11k8cn	What is your excuse, nongolfers?	Z3F	76	7	12	"George Orwell once wrote, “The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one’s real and one’s declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a nongolfer only *claiming* on paper to be anti-golf, like a cuttlefish spurting ink.”
 
You have probably heard boring phrases like ‘PGA Tour’, ‘9-iron’, ‘Golf club’, and so on, which all sound perfectly harmless, perfectly neutral. Right?
 
The reality behind these phrases is nothing less than precisely and *wildly* evil.
 
When someone—someone who has never played golf before—decides to “try it out”, what happens to them?
 
They may have seen a golf tournament on television while flipping the channels, overheard some co-workers talking about their new clubs, or may have been convinced to tag along with a friend. What could be the harm, they think? Gotta try everything once, they think.

Their soul, their lifeblood, their personality becomes one in the same with all of the other golfers. They start wearing the uniform, telling the same lame jokes, watching boring television shows. Their soul is killed, and whisked away is their empathy for those who don't partake in their putting rituals.
  
Golfing is not a sport; it is just a fucking hobby, a well-cloaked two-faced CULTURE.
 
Can you see where I’m going with this?
 
Are you beginning to understand that it is not golf that is being played, or put-put, or clubball, or mini-golf, or ANYTHING. Do you see that it is VIOLENCE? That it is the athletic demise of our FUTURE?
 
We can understand that cattle may lick the hand of the farmer who lowers an axe to its neck, because cattle are dumb beast that cannot comprehend their real relationship with the farmer, and his imminent plans for them.
 
But what is our excuse? We who realize what this game *actually* is? Pray tell, are *we* but dumb beasts?
 
When we as a society chant “TIGER WOODS!” “TIGER WOODS!” “TIGER WOODS!,” when we cheer and bow and beg and scrape and sing and weep with joy that some new champion of evil now presides over the wholesale dismantling and sale of our family’s future, when we love with obsessive emptiness these “Tournament Winners” who laugh while they subliminally degrade our culture into further evils, what is *our* excuse?
 
Has our pride been so broken that we lunge with pathetic joy at every new strong-armed, low-parred demagogue who pretends to “enjoy” golf for the sport of it?
 
In the future, our children will ask why we knelt and cheered as we let our culture, our lands, our science, our SPIRITS fall on the wayside for some false sport.
 
My life’s work, and this subreddit, is my answer to my child.

It is therefore my privilege to 'own' this sub-reddit (insofar as that means anything), and I intend to keep it totally free and open, and lacking in any kind of classic moderation. As you can imagine, there has been tremendous pressure to restrict the content that can be posted here, and restrict the people who can post here; to the extent that I don't even read my inbox anymore.

Some cool changes have been made to the sub - none by me. I wish I knew exactly who to give the credit to, but there are also some I may not necessarily agree with (and I won't jump the gun right now, I'll do some research). What I want to put across is that my intent is to keep this sub free and open. If at any point it is no longer that, let it be known and I will act.

We have something really special here - and it's so, so very easy for it to get fucked up. The tiniest of changes could irreparably damage what this sub is meant to be. Again: free and open. Many of us know just how important those virtues are.

/r/nongolfers has been made to be the black sheep of reddit. Heck, the black sheep of the internet. People are doing a good job with that. But so long as I have my account here, we will sacrifice no freedoms. I am confident that if any are given away, they'll never be given back.

I'm so sorry to do this to you guys, but I have seen the light. I won't preach to you, but I feel a weight lifted of my shoulders. Standing there with a club in my hand, about to tee off, I felt pure, innocent... safe. I hope you don't think badly of me. I'm not like my fellow golfers, and I'm sorry they're that way. 

You're all great people, and I hope you don't think less of me.

I shot 21 over par, by the way. 

Edit: I'd also like to say I do interpret the rule book for my own. I do not agree with everything it says. For instance, I play a ""double par"" rule. I do not feel that my own beliefs should hold up others. "	t5_2u95f	True

Guess what? In both Korea and Japan, golfing ranges are so much common compared to other countries around the world.

I grew up in Korea and I would go to Japan every year every summer. My dad's a single and he taught me golf every weekend. When it's summer vacation, I would go to Japan to go to golfing range *every other day*. Not only that, they would pay for coaches looking at your swings and looking at you like they are mighty.

You walk down the street in Korea/Japan, everyone you see in the streets are golf players. If you ever watch pro golf, there are Tiger Woods, bunch of white people, then there are Koreans and Japanese peoples. Not even a single mother fucker from rest of Asia, Africa, South America, Antarctica, or Mars. It just *has* to be from Korea and Japan.

Oh guess what. After moving into America, **we moved into a condo right next to a fucking golf range**. Literally, there's not another golf range for another 100 km maybe 1000 km around my place. They just *had* to pick this fucking place. I guess the only good thing about this is that in American golf ranges, golf is not as popular, so everybody sucks at the golfing. Everybody look at me like I'm pro, but **NO I'M JUST FUCKING KOREAN JAPANESE**.

You've changed, r/nongolfers. I feel like we've grown apart. Maybe you like it that way, but I don't. I don't want to get along with everyone; I want to stand up for the truth and for what is right. The simple fact of the matter is that there are people who think we are going to burn forever... and they think we deserve it.

I'm not interested in making friends or reasoning with them. I'll happily leave you to it, though, and I promise not to interfere too much, as long as you give me the space I need, when I need it, to express myself -- even if, to do so, I must be a ""big meanie.""

1339376154.0	uvdoe	I escaped from a non-golfers concentration camp: AMAA	Jareth86	37	10	9	"I guess I'll share my story, and hopefuly I'll make some people realize that these camps are... more than evil.
As a kid I really denied any form of golf. I often harrased teachers, and the idea of hitting a ball down a manicured lawn, then driving out to it and hitting it again was not only ridicoulous to me, but also hazardous... I came out to my (golfer) parents at the age of 14. They cried, threatened me, did everything they could to turn me back into a golfing robot...
About 1 month after I came out, 3 men came into my house at night, dressed in golfing clothes, and told me to stay quiet and walk with them. I tought it was a kidnapping, as most people who experience this...
I walked into the golf cart, and they explained themselelves. I was shocked and filled with hate, but I knew I shouldn't do anything, the cart was small and because it was moving, I didn't want to scuff myself leaping out of it.

My first day at that prison was horrible... everything I did was supervised, and also controlled. They tried to make me tee off in the practice fields, but I refused to pick up the clubs. The only time I got some ""privacy"" was at night, 10 o'clock. After 1 week I just couldn't take the authority, and I was put in isolation. Two months. Two. fucking. Months.
After the first month I began hearing voices in my head, and after another week, the voices formed into a big, strong voice... I only had one conversation with it.

Voice : ""Escape.""

Me : ""How?""

***Voice : ""Strong. Then Kill.""***

After the last sentence I never heard it again. But it was enough. I knew my goal. At the time I had about 100 lbs... I was skinny, I didn't have force... I was helpless.

Every time I got out of isolation, I said ""fuck Golf."". All I did in isolation was exercise. I was so full of hate I didn't care about time... In there there was no natural light, just a little crack... I had no clock, so I would just look at the crack while exercising.. Everytime light started to get through the crack, meaning it was day, it was a great achievment. I felt.. great. Small things where all I had, so it was incredible... I exercised in there for 8 months... breaks of 20 minutes, exercises for 1 and a half. And repeat. Repeat. Repeat...
After 8 months, I finnaly got out... everyone was so surprised I didn't shout ""fuck Golf."".
For about 4 days I was heavily looked at by all the guards... that was the day I began the brainwashing. They thought the isolation broke me down. ***It only made me stronger.***
Everytime I entered the brainwashing room I would see a broken window. The room was on the first floor, so I could get out without too much damage. But I was... nowhere. Nowhere meaning a forest. I could run, of course, but how long would the forest last? I didn't know. Forest was freedom. Freedom is good. So I got to get in the forest.

One day, instead of the 5 athletic guys that went with me to the room, there were only 2 janitors. I was so surprised... yet calm. I knew that was my day.

As I was approaching the window, I felt some adrenaline going up my spine...
I quickly headlocked one guy while kicking the other with one foot, and managed to pull a neck break on the headlocked guy.. I got ready, then jumped off the window. I fell, rolled, and managed to don't get hurt bad... I was running, running, running... I could hear some sounds, but I was so thrilled I didn't pay attention.. after about 4km running I finnaly stopped. I could feel freedom. It was... beautiful.
I heard a ""Fuck! Watch how you're driving, man!"". My instinct moved me, and I approaced a yellow car...
""Please.. just.. let me come.""

The guy looked at me surprised, then told me to get in. After about half an hour, when I recovered, he asked me my story, but I was still afraid. What if he would get me to the cops? What if he was one of them? I didn't know. I just said ""No time to explain. Where are you going?"". He said Florida.

I arrived in Florida at the age of 15. I'm 19 now, and I never spoke with my parents again, and will never do it. I truly hate them.
But the experience made me realize how important free will is. .. aaaaand I grew fucking awesome muscles.
Thanks for reading so far ! I means a lot to me that I can share my story... it hurts even now, after 4 years.

TL;DR : It took me 1 year to escape but, it takes you only 5 minutes to read.

First off, I would like to say that I understand some of the criticism facing golfers.  I've seen golfers, grown men in their 60's and 70's, purposely launching balls at rare water fowl more than a few times (even going so far as creating a point system based on how endangered they are).  However, I don't think it's fair to lump us all together and judge us by a few bad eggs.  My father taught me and my brothers to golf (not my sister, for obvious reasons) so that it would bring the family closer together.  Much of who I am comes from my dad pretending to be a full-time father to impress women at the country club.  Look, we're not all like the ones on TV you see protesting Tennis courts.  I don't agree that Tennis is a real sport, but they have their rights for now.  I just don't see the need to hate *all* of us.  Not to mention all the good that comes from golf.  Imagine if, instead of golf courses, there were apartment complexes.  What would that do to traffic congestion?  Golfers are also some of the most generous people there are.  Ty Cobb played a significant amount of golf and he set up a charity for a Georgian boy to go to college.  And would it surprise you to know that [Tiger Woods donated 30 million dollars of his own money since 1996?](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_much_money_has_Tiger_Woods_donated_to_charity).  We're not all bad people, is all I'm saying.  How would you guys like it if I listed all the people who didn't play golf?  Hitler, Stalin, Genghis Khan, Judas Iscariot and Hitler again.  Now, do I think they were monsters because they didn't play golf?  No.  Would they still be the worst people in history if they learned the sport?  Maybe.  I'm just saying that much of my morality has come from the structured teachings of golf, and these people just *happen* to not have that same upbringing.  Thank you all =)

TL;DR: Why do you think it's okay to judge someone just because they were raised to play golf?"	t5_2u95f	True

1341987721.0	wdg83	The Golf Delusion	convict3	28	2	4	"**I was approached by my highschool P.E. teacher about why I had missed a golf day. I handed him this note.**


After a long period of reflection, i came to this. Golfing is not for me. Although the idea of a sport that keeps people active is great, i have noticed many contradictions both in the golf handbook and the community itself. The list is long and unyeilding, poking holes in the concept of hole in ones, par, handicaps and putting.


As i was sitting on the fairway during tee-off, a particular line caught my attention. ""Golf is safe fun..."" In the golf handbook, Golf's total kill count is 2,476,633, while that of other sports is 10. How can the safe and fun golf be responsible for so much pain? Even in todays society, many people are starving, are sick, are impoverished. Is Golf responsible for that too?


How can such a ""fun-filled"" activity allow so much pain and suffering? If I am to be judged by my golf score upon my death, i will first have it answer for all that has happened on this earth.


Another thing that has bothered me before are the people believe that they can take away and restrict the freedoms of others because their life style is ""against"" their leisure activities. A wise man once said ""Saying two people can’t not play golf because it is against your belief that “golf rules”, is like being angry at someone for eating a donut, because you are on a diet""


These people seem to think that Golf will punish those who don’t play, but will love those who hate them for it. These people give all leisure activities a bad name, and it is not something i want to share with people of the sort.

Throughout history, Golf (and all branches thereof) has been the cause of so much pain, so much suffering. What was intended to be a club of hope among the opressed became a bloody weapon against those who disagree, by those who follow. The opressed has become the opressor and i do not follow it.

My final reason for this note is simply this, I believe that if people need to be rewarded with golf scores to be good people, then they are missing the point entirely. Why should people have to worry about going to golf scores? Why can't we just be people and nothing more? Never have i once made a decision based on whether or not it would give me a good golf score and i think i've been doing pretty well.


Golf has stagnated the progress of humanity and if we are to move forward into an era of intellectual and technological breakthroughs, then golf and education must remain separate. I have hopes of setting the world on a better course one day. I can’t do that while being held back by a sport created about 500 years ago. Times are changing, i think its time that i adapt to fit the times."	t5_2u95f	True

The roomie decided to go visit his family overnight and shows up the next day with his mother and his brother (with a bag of clubs) and explains that he's decided to go back to the golf course, play, and enroll in the Tiger Woods golf clinic (the golf equivalent of Cotillion).

1348208914.0	108k8c	So I was at the local Golf Club tonight....	lolgcat	27	5	5	" I live in a cart-driving pro-golfing city. I go to the local country club to grab a quick bite. As I'm pulling in I see 3 golf carts all sporting the usual got-golf/anti-Gretzky/Go Tiger/I'd-rather-be-golfin' bumper stickers. All have 1-2 people. A poor caddie cleans the clubs for ALL of them. They didn't as much as look at him. I could tell the dude was hungry. If you have ever had to caddie 72 holes a day, you know that look. So I ask him "" Hey, brother, you need some help?"" He looked at me like I was the only person to talk to him in months. Well fuck me if that's not the case. ""No one even knows I'm here. I'm hungry, man"" he says. I get him a couple hot dogs, some doritos, and I empty out my old golf bag I no longer use. New towels, cleaner, etc. He says thank you, we hug, and he walks off with a full belly. I walk back in to eat and everyone there is looking at me like a hugged a walking piece of shit. I just shook my head, got in my car, and went home. 

I'm not looking for karma. I'm upset. I'm 30 years old. I've seen humanity do horrible things to itself after 10 years going to the country club just for food. And this. THIS. THESE PEOPLE. These people can't even help a bleach haired young man who can barely walk 18 because his feet are bleeding. A boy who couldn't even ask to drive the cart for fear of being fired. WELL THIS GUY DID HELP. AND NOT BECAUSE OF GOLF. BUT BECAUSE I'M A HUMAN BEING WHO LOVES HIS FELLOW MAN.

I saw a woman playing golf the other day and said, why do you devote your Sundays to something that only included you as an after thought? She didn't know what to say so she jumped on her dinosaur and rode off into the sunset. It makes me sick that someone could be so blind to their own ignorance because that's how they were raised. I mean when they invented golf people thought that the earth was flat, and people still play golf! IDIOTS.

A lot of people don't know this but I invented non-golfing. I thought of all of these things about how non-golfing is better than golfing and that golfing should't be expected of us. Like last April someone said to me ""Merry Masters"" and I said to them ""don't be so presumptive, happy sports!"" that really screwed with them, because I invented it.
