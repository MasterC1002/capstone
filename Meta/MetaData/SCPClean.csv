What if most SCPS were ten times more dangerous and nasty and horrible until their opposition discovered a calm, regular humanoid scp...namely mankind.

Mankind was a cognitohazard, capable of damping down anger, taking the edge off memes, basically calming shit down into something barely containable.

So the SCP opposition created the Foundation...and most of Earth. We're just 200 years old and what we think is a lonely planet in a far corner of the universe is actually all Foundation. From North to South, West to East. Because  most of the SCPs threaten far more then what we can ever know.

TL;DR: In short, folks, we're all part of the Foundation. 

Edit 1: Don't tell the Overseers they're basically D-Class.

Edit 2: This'd explain a lot. Like when many of the head doctors were rampaging super-beings. And 'God' hanging around in a containment cell. These are just representatives of the -real- Foundation checking up on things. "	t5_2r4ni	True

1361494414.0	18zof4	[Mod Post] We need to have a talk regarding 682 (and other such popular SCPs).	ElXGaspeth	96	6	38	"Hi everyone, thank you for reading this post.

For those of you who don't know, I'm Dr. Kens, senior staff over at the wiki and moderator (and creator) of this subreddit. I've been a part of the community for running on four years now, so please take what I have to say to heart.

Please stop creating new posts to talk about SCP-682. We don't need to hear about how one SCP can be used to contain/destroy/kill/incapacitate it. Something you think is original is, with a large degree of certainty, most likely already been mentioned, discussed, and debunked/thrown out. SCP-682 is one of the first articles, and as such, one of the most to be discussed about.

Let me put it this way. It's been around since 2008. [Here is a link to the search results when 682 pops up.](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/search:site/a/f/q/682) Pretty much 80-90% of all the results are by people trying to kill 682.

[Here's a link of the termination log.](http://www.scp-wiki.net/experiment-log-t-98816-oc108-682)

And that's just on the wiki. What about here?

Well...[here's one](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/18gx0n/question_about_scp682/). And [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/wozvf/disposing_of_scp682_using_scp093/). Oh, [another](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/1601mn/could_scp1016_be_used_to_kill_scp682/)! [And again](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/w2zxs/suggested_termination_of_682/). Have I [made](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/18aiht/what_if_we_exposed_682_to_that_mirror_that_slowly/) my [point](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/171s5t/termination_order_scp682_against_scp096/) yet? The [number](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/v0t7m/another_consideration_for_terminating_scp682/) of [examples](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/10uyl4/i_propose_we_take_scp682_and_lock_him_in_scp087/) just [keeps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/upman/scp1616_versus_682/) on [growing](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/17fcum/what_of_we_put_scp682_in_a_container_with_scp106/).

You can see how it can get out of hand.

Is the discussion of SCP-682 banned? No, but it's going to be limited to a single thread which ~~will be created later~~ can be [found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/18zp8s/official_scp682_discussion_thread/). Any other submissions will be removed.

That said, submissions regarding tales, comics, animations, etc about killing 682 will still be allowed. We're not trying to strangle creativity here, folks, just the constant stream of ""Can [INSERT SCP] kill/main/destroy/contain SCP-682?"" posts.

We did this over at the wiki, too. It's a rule that's helped keep the conversation from filling up this way.

Thank you for your time, everyone.

- Dr. Kens

-------------------------------------------------
New Rule: All SCP Fuel posts must include a rough draft of an SCP article and/or an explanation of how the content is SCP worthy.  
---------------------

---------------------------------------
The main point is to show how much SCP potential the post has.
This way, we hope that SCP fuel posts will start constructive discussions towards the creation of a new SCP article.

**Clarification: As long as there's at least one comment describing the SCP worthiness of the post then you're fine. It doesn't have to be written by the author, but if we see a post without such a comment then it will be removed. Posts will have a 3 hour grace period to satisfy this requirement.**

I would like to thank you guys for joining the SCP community or if you were already a member, thank you for joining this subreddit. 

---------------------------------
We have overcome several obstacles as /r/SCP grew, such as handling ""What if 682..."" questions and stopping excessive RP. 


Also the surge in new SCP ideas/drafts and the revival of /r/SCP_Game is amazing. Seriously, it's the hard work of members like these that keep the SCP community thriving. 

Though everyone should always remember that no matter how popular 173 and 682 are, there will always be people who haven't read or don't understand them yet. I appreciate those of you who continue to answer their questions.

Looking at the [statistics](http://stattit.com/r/scp/) brings me hope for the future of /r/SCP and I look forward to our next milestone. *I'm looking at you /r/starcraft_strategy!* 

-----------------



But I am curious about one thing. **How did you guys find this subreddit?**

------------------------
**For the new recruits:**

If you are new to SCP and have questions, please don't hesitate to ask. We're as excited about generating new SCP content as when we are introducing new members to the SCP Universe. Take the time to get to know us, and I promise you'll be hooked.

Oh and one more thing:

***Welcome to the SCP Foundation. Enjoy your stay.***

I dunno about anyone else here, but I myself have to find certain... *""escapes""* during the day...certain activities that can take my mind away from the pain of a Brain Condition I was born with...and that usually meant Video Games, Comics and Books. Ever since one of the SCP's made the top page of r/TrueCreepy *(endless staircase)*, I've found myself reading SCP's and Tales when I would usually be spending money I don't have on digital comics. 


I really love this Wiki and all those who build into it! It's amazingly well written with an incredible sense of both mystery and creativity that brings me back time and time again. Maybe my new Tablet is an SCP in itself that's making me slightly addicted to reading these pages, but I'm pretty sure it's just the talent and dedication of those who create the pages themselves.

Someone writes a short entry about a character's SCP-related death (each story ending with the line ""And then I died.""), and based on the story, others try to guess which SCP did the killing. Whoever makes a correct guess gets bragging rights and the honor of writing the next story. If no correct guesses are made, the original author makes a new post with the answer to the previous challenge, and a new entry with a different SCP.

Feel free to ask anything regarding clarification of the rules, what you're allowed to do, etc. If we get enough people interested, I'll start us off with a story in a separate post.

To imagine that it has been 8 months since my [first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/sy5ts/video_report_scp895/) to this subreddit is amazing. 

It has been a while since the last ""feedback"" post, so please tell us about any concerns, suggestions, or criticisms related to /r/SCP in the comments. **Are you happy with how /r/SCP is moderated? What else would you like to see happen in this subreddit? Should we get Marvin some antidepressants?**




Also I would like to remind everyone that even though we are part of the SCP Community, we are part of Reddit too. So please help out new members who are struggling to understand SCP.

Mrepic37	50	8	16	"Hi r/SCP, I had an idea a while back for a text based SCP game, with similar themes to containment breach, but more personal, as literature allows. At first I was thinking a simple 'if A go to page 45' approach, but now I've been thinking of subtle changes that can be made, and last for that whole game, such as befriending an agent, or finding a Level 5 keycard.

The game will be the path of a D-Class, from near execution, to escaping a destroyed facility, or helping to contain the escaped scips and having your life spared; but I haven't thought the specifics through yet.

Let me know if this is an idea worth pursuing, or if you have any suggestions; it will take a fair amount of effort to produce to the full, and I don't want to expend that time if nobody actually wants to see it completed.

PS: for those who care, it will be written in C++

EDIT/UPDATE: Thanks for the support everyone, and I've started work. If anyone has an idea for a title...?

RE-EDIT: I think I'll only include a few SCP's, otherwise it will get on top of me, and way over the top. With the framework of the actual program, I am eventually going to write it so the actual program is extremely minimal, and the story is stored in a separate plain text file, meaning people can use the program to write their own choose your own adventure games, with no programming experience. That will take a far sight longer though, so I'll be finishing the base game first.

Remember [that post about the Latvian SCP joke?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/1ce5fd/latvian_scp_is_best_scp_xpost_from_rlatvianjokes/)

[Well, unfortunately, someone decided to post it over on the main wiki.](http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-645309) And they weren't the original author.

The senior staff reviewed it, and decided that the plagiarism wasn't done maliciously, but it was still plagiarism.

I didn't think I'll have to say this outright, but when you're posting and submitting work on the main wiki, **you need to be the original author**, or at least have permission to post. When you post a page on the main wiki, it is usually automatically assumed that you wrote the tale/SCP/content of that page. If you didn't write it, don't post it there. It's not like reddit where you can share something funny or witty. Please don't do things like this.

Oh, it's still a large organization, but it must carefully balance its resources. A Safe object will usually merit only $5,000 annual containment costs- a lot of safe objects need to be put in a box and locked up in a room together to be worth it. A Euclid SCP item would require the most exacting care to determine the most cost-efficient means of containing something. Perhaps it's $80k a year. Oh, that might sound like a lot, but that's three (low-paid) security guards, one on duty at all times, but with no backup, plus a set of cement walls, a nice door, and a new set of steel locks and chains every year... Assuming SCP owns the facility outright.

Of course, the lion's share of resources would still go to Keters, but a razor-eyed accountant would still go over each of these items. Instead of digging a new 2000-foot borehole, you go over to some old soviet contacts and borrow an old nuke test bore.

Say that a current containment protocol of some Euclid with a half-dozen civilian casualties and two downed agents calls for 360 degree monitoring of a 3-acre area of forest in Manitoba, including 12-foot steel-reinforced concrete, HD cameras every 10 feet, and a staff of 300 well-trained guards with Land Warrior weapon systems and a sixteen magazines of solid silver bullets.

In our less wealthy foundation, the final design might consist of 8-foot barbed wire fencing surrounding only the 2-acre ""white zone"", a set of 8 cameras monitoring primarily the ""black zone"" at the heart and the main gate and security station, and five shifts of 24 guards- with at least one off-duty shift present at the facility at the same time as the on-duty shift is patrolling. They are armed with a pistol or rifle (personal equipment) 3 magazines of conventional ammo, and one magazine of silver bullets... plus one silver bullet carried loose as a final reserve.

After we add up the cost of food and sundries for the facility, maintenance personnel and costs, taxes... that relatively simple defensive measure still comes up to $3.6 million in guard salaries, $300k for a 12-man maintenance team, Let's throw annother mil in there for benefits, replacement, training, and bonuses, and if we assume that the land was bought outright, and we've already paid for the facility and walls, and it only costs $50k to pay for replacement parts... that's almost $5 million a year just to keep some unusual Canadians under control... assuming that appeasing them doesn't consume some valuable material, such as B+ blood or something.

Why is this a good idea? Well, consider the difference between some random dude hiker wandering up to a 12-foot high wall, getting spotted immediately, and promptly getting juiced up on type-B amnesiacs and thrown into town. Compare this to a hiker finding an old chain link fence, and seeing some guys in ranger outfits hiking around... but they only come around once an hour or so, so he hops the fence- he's got to see what's over there... Then, of course, all SCP ever sees is a new [redacted] on top of the big [redacted] and the patrol teams get a demotion for letting another civilian in.

In a broader sense, it is too easy in a normal SCP story for them to simply bury a toxic monster in money. It should feel like every action the foundation takes to stop or slow one threat is only taking resources away from a potentially greater threat somewhere else.

One key to this is the elimination of anything that makes something from nothing, especially personnel. In this particular setting, class-ds would not be disposable- only so many condemned criminals can ""disappear"" every year, after all. "	t5_2r4ni	True

My own experience was from reading the SCP-087 article and some of the tales surrounding it. I initially thought that the articles were interesting, but not too scary. But one evening, when I was visiting my cousin, I noticed for the first time that the stairs for his apartment look eerily similar to the ones in the SCP-087 picture. After the visit, when I was walking back down these stairs, it was almost a picture perfect match (minus the actual SCP), since it was dark and there was no lighting. I was scared so witless I could not decide whether to sprint down as fast as I could, or walk down slowly ""just in case"". Somehow I made it back to my car, but wow, I've never been that rattled before, and I've used those stairs many times before reading about SCP-087.

**Current Containment Procedures:**

SCP-083 is to be kept under constant video surveillance, with at least one Level 3 staff member on call at all times to respond to security breaches. Entrance to SCP-083 is permissible to level 1 and 2 personnel with proper clearances, provided they wear a tracking device while inside.

**Current Annual Containment Expenditures:**

Three shifts, Level 3 security staff members, one (1) per shift: $120,000
 
Three shifts, Level 2 security staff members, one (1) per shift: $90,000

Three shifts, Level 1 security staff members, three (3) per shift: $180,000

Video surveillance system, consisting of eight (8) cameras, wiring, and upkeep and maintenance: $1,600

One shift, Level 1 maintenance staff members, two (2) per shift: $50,000

Salary, Regional Oversight Officer, Level 1 facility staff member: $36,000

O&amp;M, Guard facility and camera viewing area, including O&amp;M of front business (residential apartment address [REDACTED], 120 meters west along street from SCP-083): $20,000

Regional Oversight Officer dispensable fund, emergency O&amp;M, and other misc. costs: $21,200

Total costs estimate: $518,800

Cost management grade: **A-**

As current plans are acceptable, a total review is not yet in order. However, local overwatch should consider redistributing current manpower to more urgent issues by down grading guard shifts to one level 2 guard and a level 1 guard for all shifts, and if activity at the site remains quiet, downgrade further to one level 1 guard and removing the daily maintenance crew rotation. In case of serious manpower shortage, totally automated observation with a single guard monitoring cameras remotely from site [REDACTED] should be sufficient to respond to any accidental discoveries.

1364862128.0	1bh7u8	[Mod Post] New SCP Subreddit!	Nivek12	47	14	39	"Happy April Fools' Day
----------------------------

In the early days of /r/SCP we accepted all kinds of content because the community was small. As this subreddit gained more readers, it attracted content such as SCP memes to SCP RP. Of course now we have rules and guidelines to keep /r/SCP from degenerating into a meme-field, but after the huge boost in attention, we feel that the SCP community on reddit deserves a new outlet. We have been suppressing an important group among us for far too long. Their stress and pent up tension will finally be able to gush forth into their very own community space where others who prefer alternate forms of SCP content can share their euphoric ideas. 

---------------------------------------------------------

So today we are proud to announce /r/SCPPorn !

This new subreddit will cater to the tight knit group of SCP redditors who find themselves browsing /r/SCP with only one free hand. 

The existence of SCP porn was thought to be a myth. However with so much of the internet made of porn, there is naturally SCP erotic material. 

Now we understand that this is a controversial move, however please understand that one can only suppress their sexual urges for so long. At last SCP redditors can get the ""chills"" and ""creeps"" through a new focus. 

So rejoice! /r/SCPPorn will let redditors share intimate moments with their favorite fictional characters and bring a whole new level of emotional writing to the community. 

-----------------------------------------------------

If /r/SCPPorn is successful, we plan on launching several more SCP subreddits including:

* /r/SCP_WillItDie
* /r/le_SCP
* /r/Ask682

and many more!

1349243639.0	10v24p	From the desk of Archivist Dr. ████████	PTTGx2	34	4	2	"A Note on clarity in SCP documentation

I do not make idle threats. In this case, I merely would remind all containment staff that we work with immediately fatal- and worse, _gradually_ fatal- hazards at all times. We do this because our mission is, in part, to bring clarity to those things that are obscure.

With that in mind, I would like to bring to the attention of our staff the definition of the word ""vanish"". You all posses dictionaries, I see no need for redundantly copying the text here. Suffice it to say that it means merely that an object has left view. It may have been hidden behind a curtain, walked away of its own accord, or suffered a discontinuity in existence; the word ""vanished"" does not clearly imply any specific effect.

Now then, recall that many of the items and persons in our care are notable in that they possess the ability to become lost the moment they are not observed. This is clearly very distinct from the capacity to, for instance, displace oneself while in plain view, instantly ceasing to exist in one place and at the same moment commencing elsewhere- or perhaps nowhere. These too are features of many of our guests. Further, both of these abilities are distinct from items that merely become _invisible_, remaining tangible. Every one of these effects is dangerous, and each in very different ways.

Perhaps this seems like a trivial citation of writing style. I feel otherwise. Consider SCP-████; it is informally referred to as the Tricky Gun. I am not violating any high-level security protocols when I explain that this item is in our possession because it fires ""vanishing"" bullets- ones that _vanish_ after a very small interval of time- only sufficient to travel a handful of feet out of the barrel before the effect takes hold.

Do they become invisible, perhaps to help an assassin remain unidentified? Do they evaporate, becoming harmless after a yard or so, the result of some reality warper's innate attempt at survival? Or do the bullets travel a ways and then teleport, allowing the shooter to fire through solid obstacles, or bypass allies?

Entry SCP-████ does not note.

For those members of the Foundation that insist on writing about items which ""vanish"", without further explanation or clear context, I invite you to visit me in my office in the Archives department so you might experience the effect of _vanished_ bullets. My door will remain, as always, open.

Otherwise it might be damaged.

Please tell the accounting department that the starting pistol, luminescent paint, and box of ammunition for said starting pistol are all, indeed, operating expenses for the archives division.

The two guys are slowbeef, mod of the [LP forum](http://forums.somethingawful.com/forumdisplay.php?forumid=191) on Something Awful (where LP originated), and Diabetus. It's like MST3K but with videos of people talking while playing video games (poorly) instead of bad horror and sci-fi movies.

Anyway, in February they posted a video where someone was doing an LP of the Containment Breach game, titled [""This Let's Play is Highly Recommended for \[DATA EXPUNGED\]""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOPAMS3RkXk). They joke about the frame rate, the long gaps between commentary, the guy playing it not knowing what he's doing (he forgets the name of the game), and other stuff (after getting killed by 173: ""well you basically get the game now."" Slowbeef: ""What? *I* explained more of it!"").

However, the real star of this is the video description slowbeef made:

&gt;Item #: SCP 436-LP

&gt;Object Class: Keter

&gt;Special Containment Procedure: Item 436-LP is to be kept on an obscure YouTube channel owned by a D-Class user. 436-RP is not to be watched for periods of longer than five minutes at a time, and certainly not more than once. 436-LP may be watched if overdubbed by others, and could be generally improved if [DATA EXPUNGED]

&gt;Description: 436-LP appears to be a low framerate recording of an independent video game playthrough. Game appears to be based on a Wiki of horror stories based on SCP-173 and others. 436-LP was indirectly discovered by Dr. Cooper who found the creator's YouTube channel, thereby discovering SCP 435-LP, a playthrough of Sonic the Hedgehog in which the framerate was so low, D-Class viewers were met with feelings of regret, nausea, and in some cases, a desire to never watch YouTube videos again.

&gt;Cats seem strangely adverse to 435-RP; as do most humans. Viewing the original version has now been classified as procedure 111-Montauk, and is now how we traumatize that girl from SCP-231 instead, because that whole entry was terrible. Seriously, this wiki was supposed to be creepy horror stories, right? That one was just gross. Anyway, watching 435-LP for extended periods of time lead to [REDACTED] and [DATA EXPUNGED]. The worst of 436-RPs affects seem to be [REDACTED]. [DATA EXPUNGED]. [REDACTED]. [REDACTED]. [UNREDACTED, THEN RE-REDACTED]. [CITATION NEEDED].

That's not the full thing, but much of the ""addendum"" is an inside joke that probably only people familiar with Retsupurae would get/like.

Something a bit like Torchwood.  I was just going to post here to see if there was any interest in this kind of project before making any serious effort to work on it.

If anybody has any ideas for episode plots or character development, I'd definitely be open to hearing them.  I'm thinking that the series centers around a guy who has just been hired and assigned to Site-19.  The series would deal primarily with his ability to handle the specific kinds of work required of him by the foundation, but would of course also have some action provided by the acquisition of new SCPs, containment breaches, and interactions with counter-foundation organizations.

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1543 is currently uncontained. Three (3) Foundation digital surveillance and analysis teams have been made aware of relevant information regarding the entity's existence and/or its activity; team D21-B have been assigned to locating the entity, D21-C to monitoring for and neutralising the entity's activity, and D22-A to developing countermeasures for the Foundation's digital resources.

**Description:** SCP-1543 is a humanoid robot who appears to be sentient, and of at least human-level intelligence. The robot is able to communicate verbally when it chooses, and self-identifies as ""Marvin"". Interviews with the entity reveal that it was originally created by The Factory, apparently as a prototype for other such robots with so-called “Genuine People Personalities” technology; as such, the entity claims to feel human emotion. In particular, it continually acts in a way which would for a human be considered symptomatic of severe clinical depression, complaining of headaches, fatigue and boredom caused by lack of stimulation for its “brain the size of a planet”. To date, no other robot or device has been found presenting similar such effects or technology.

Since being released from Foundation custody during the Chaos Insurgency’s chaotic insurgency in 1924, SCP-1543 has become active on the internet - in particular, on the conspiracy theorist website “reddit”. Should a user of this website mention by name an object in Foundation custody, the entity will reply with a seemingly normal hyperlink which when clicked will - despite the Foundation’s extensive layers of digital security - breach the SCP object database and reveal the Foundation’s summary report on the object.

Efforts are currently underway to discredit the conspiracy website, largely by flooding the site with repeated inane pictures of cats, and give the SCP summary database the cover of a horror writing website."	t5_2r4ni	True

SCP-[123](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-123) is a hollow geodesic sphere that contains a black hole that, like most black holes, sucks things in.

It was late last night where I was browsing the SCP list, scaring the crap out of myself because I was tired and dumb (stay away from 1003 late at night) when I stumbled across these two SCPs. If I'm not mistaken, couldn't they just leave 505 to drip into the black hole that is 123 because that seems like a much better permanent solution then the paper towels that are in place at the moment.

tl;dr poison ink go into black hole rather than ocean

EDIT: Seeing as a few people say that it is ""too dangerous"" to test, which is really boring. I feel that it would be a better idea to put 505 into [1543-J](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1543-j) and *literally* fling it into the sun. Sounds reasonable to me."	t5_2r4ni	True

Here goes nothing:

-------------

Item #: SCP-XXXX

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-XXXX is to be contained within a 10*10*10 meter cell, fitted with an experimental neutral-gravity generator, as designed by Dr. ██████, who is to directly oversee the operation should a new cell be required. At no time is any form of matter to come into contact with SCP-XXXX, and as a result, any and all cells it is contained within is to be drained of all air, and to contain an absolute vacuum. Should a containment breach occur in the site currently housing SCP-XXXX, and the neutral-gravity field to fail, it is to be suspended from the ground by a carbon fiber cable 1cm in diameter, and at least 200m long. This cable is to be fully extended by any means available, to increase the time in which there is to repair or establish a new neutral-gravity field. In order to prevent SCP-XXXX-1 reaching a separation event, SCP-XXXX is to be transferred to another cable before SCP-XXXX-1 reaches 10m below the attachment to whatever is supporting the cable. At no point in time is SCP-XXXX to be in an are less than 100km from any ocean, and as such will permanently be situated on the continent of Asia. In the event of a breach at the site currently containing SCP-XXXX, transporting a compliant reality bender to the compromised site becomes top priority, and cannot be overridden by any command regarding that SCP, excluding a unanimous decision by the O5 Council, Ethics Committee, and the highest members of world politics, who are aware of the SCP Foundation.


Description: SCP-XXXX is biologically a  ██ year old Caucasian female, genetically identical to ████ █████, who is currently living in [REDACTED]. ████ █████ was only made aware of SCP-XXXX during Interview-XXXX-023, and given the inconclusive nature of the interview, was given Class-A amnesiacs and released afterwards. SCP-XXXX is locked in the foetal position, although this is not clear if it is due to SCP-XXXX-1 or otherwise. SCP-XXXX has not exhibited any signs of life or movement since containment, yet this again may be due to SCP-XXXX-1. When SCP-XXXX comes into direct contact with any matter whatsoever, including gasses, filaments of SCP-XXXX-1 will spread from its body onto that matter. During Experiment-XXXX-19A, it was discovered that these filaments bind to particles on the subatomic level, and possibly deeper. Although useful information was found from Experiment-XXXX-19A, all supervisors and researchers involved were terminated for their incompetence, and for proceeding even after plans had been denied by O5 Council. 

SCP-XXXX-1 is a material that fully encompasses SCP-XXXX-1, and is extruded when it comes into contact with other matter. Due to the nature of SCP-XXXX-1, it is not entirely certain whether it is strictly matter, or normal matter. It is theorized that it is made up of [DATA EXPUNGED] SCP-XXXX-1 is capable of withstanding any amount of force recorded, and has not been seen to break or flex when exposed to forced of over  ███,███PSI. When SCP-XXXX is still in contact with the original point of contact with matter, filaments of SCP-XXXX-1 will continue to spread at a rate proportional to the surface area of SCP-XXXX that is in contact with matter; however when SCP-XXXX is restored to a pure vacuum, SCP-XXXX-1 will begin to retract. At full immersion in pure deuterium, 'tendrils' of SCP-XXXX-1 can spread from SCP-XXXX at a speed of approximately █m/s. SCP-XXXX-1 also blocks any and all electromagnetic radiation, heat, and sound, which gives it a 100% reflection rate of light, meaning it is pure white. After SCP-XXXX-1 has spread approximately 1█.██km from SCP-XXXX, it will undergo what is called a 'separation event'. After a separation event, all of SCP-XXXX-1 except the covering over SCP-XXXX will change drastically, absorbing all EM radiation, heat, and kinetic energy instead of reflecting it; this causes it to turn pure black. At and after this point, if SCP-XXXX is recontained, SCP-XXXX-1 will continue to expand, at one tenth of maximum rate. This has been experienced only once, during incident 19-XXXX-403A. After the separation event, SCP-XXXX-1 will become susceptible to the will of reality benders, and as such, in the event of a breach, reality bending SCPs become necessary to have on hand.

Incident Report 19-XXXX-403A: On ██/██/████, SCP-███ caused a containment breach at Site ██, where SCP-XXXX was held. Due to the nature of SCP-███, this caused all power to be lost from the site, meaning the neutral-gravity field was temporarily shut down. As the site was made structurally unstable, portions of the floor of SCP-XXXX's cell had collapsed, meaning when SCP-XXXX fell inside, it allowed for greater surface area contact with denser material. This unfortunate coincidence resulted in the rate of expansion almost doubling what would have normally occurred, and leading to the spread of SCP-XXXX-1 over 50km, resulting in a massive separation event. Several satellites were destroyed, and over ██GB of satellite and other photography witnessing the event had to be destroyed, and a population of over ██,███ people required Class-A amnesiacs. SCPs ███, ███ and ████ had to be flown to the site to help recontain SCP-XXXX.

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX is to be held in testing room ███ at site ██. It is to be placed on its pedestal facing the appropriately marked wall and chair. SCP-XXXX is only to be used during testing by personnel with Level-2 security clearance or higher. Personal use of SCP-XXXX is forbidden due to the possibility of discovering something dangerous (See Testing Log). Any personnel using SCP-XXXX without authorization will be detained and reprimanded.

Testing of SCP-XXXX must be recorded at all times due to the high number of settings it has. Testing of a new setting must be brought up for review and approved by Level-3 Security Clearance or higher.

**Description:** SCP-XXXX appears to be a small digital camera that resembles a blue '[Canon](http://buzfairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Canon-SX200is.jpg)' brand camera with no identifying marks or damage. SCP-XXXX doesn't appear to require a power source, as it lacks a battery compartment. It powers on and off similar a normal digital camera of this brand, and can be left on indefinitely without loss of power or forced shutoff due to inactivity.

SCP-XXXX will take a picture when the circular button on the top surface is pressed. Currently, a setting for video has not been found. Holding the button will let the camera focus before taking a picture. The picture is deleted if not saved to an outside SD card. A regular Secure Digital (SD) card will fit into the memory slot of SCP-XXXX. The wheel around the camera button can be twisted to let the camera lens zoom in and out.

The camera seems to be able to zoom to the molecular level, despite the 12X Zoom Lens printed on the lens itself. This was discovered when Agent D██████ zoomed in for approximately five (5) minutes when pointed at a potato. The screen showed [this image](http://i.imgur.com/EeLDEEa.png). Further testing of the zoom lens capability is awaiting approval.

The wheel next to the camera button functions as a normal settings wheel for a digital camera, except there are more settings than printed on the wheel itself. When powered off and on, the settings revert to basic colored picture mode and the zoom resets to standard zoom. The settings will reset to normal picture mode regardless of what position the wheel is at when powered on. 

When switching settings using the settings wheel, the area in view of the camera lens changes appropriately. Scrolling to black and white, for example, will set the area in view from the lens of the camera to a black and white tone, while other areas outside of the view of the lens remain in color. Whatever the camera sees becomes completely black and white when viewed by outside sources. Moving the camera changes the color of the area in view, and the previous area reverts to its original color scheme.

As they use the desk more and more, they get angrier and angrier, lashing out at any who come near them. When they leave the desk, they forget what had just happened and calmly say, ""If you'd like a turn, I'd be happy to oblige"" before bleeding out of the nose, ears, and eyes, and then dying. Causes of this phenomena are unknown, but they happen every time without fail. First time thinking up an SCP, any thoughts?

Edit: According to ActionKermit, the pressure caused by an unruptured aneurism can cause aggression, as well as an increase in blood pressure. Together, these symptoms/blights/injuries can cause a bleeding out of the ears, eyes, eyes and nose, followed by death. Changed the death from cardiac arrest to this.

Each ""page"" would have the same information from the SCP website as well as maybe having scenarios attached that were playable. Such as a scenario matching the description of how the item was obtained or a scenario where you are D-class person that interacts with the object (or even a researcher watching what happens when someone else interacts). 

That being said, I have very little coding or model making experience (barely any more level editing experience than those two) so I doubt I'd be suitable for making this. However, I may look into it during some spare time. Think it would be worth the venture? 

edit: Another idea is also replicating each of the scenarios for some of the higher rated objects such as all the neutralization attempts of 682.

I've made a couple of posts regarding this before, and it recieved some pretty positive feedback, which is good. Basically, I want to make a community-based Interactive Fiction game, about the Foundation. Because Inform 7 (thanks DeliaEris and Phroon) is based on native language, it means you need next to none experience to create something for it; which means, as opposed to a game like Containment Breach, everyone can contribute, which would be really cool.

When it's completed (or somewhere near it), it'll look like a collaborative tale, but you can play it; which would be really cool.

Getting a bit ahead of myself, I made a subreddit for it, /r/interactivefoundation, because I think that's the best way we can all submit ideas, and discuss.

So this idea for a SCP I had was an otherwise empty containment room in Site 12 that somehow began 'rotating' through different objects. One hour a pencil. Then for the next three days, a record player that played nothing but Beatles Songs never heard before. Then looseleaf sheets of paper, one a minute.

Etc. Etc. They decided to lock it up, post a few guards and forget about it. Two months later, the Site Director manifested inside and used emergency backup codes to order the doors open. They were. The Director exited and left calmly. Then it was confirmed the Director had been on the opposite end of the site. 

Everyone in a command position was put on computer tracery. A week later, the head of the Ethics committee, who is not based in Site 12 appeared in the room. She used HER emergency orders, which over-rode the computer system and and opened the doors. It was later confirmed the Ethics committee member went missing four minutes -after- she appeared in the room and then left in a car she ordered given to her. Missing in Shanghai, China, far from Site 12. 

Everything was put on mechanicals. 

So now Site 12 is in a pickle. What if it manifests an Overseer next? Or someone's beloved Grandmother? 
 
Staffing Site 12 with socipaths is -possible- but do you want to trust the containment of entities to people who might jut let the entity out for shits and giggles? If you put a secondary monitoring station around the containment room, you run the risk of the SCP bringing forth someone the secondary monitors care for. Or obey.

Bear with me here. O.J. Simpson got sent to prison the first time around, for example. Not much fun for Nicole, but things went much smoother on the justice part. Various criminals do their things, go to jail right away. 

Then a lone SCP breakout kills twelve people...in our world. But in the newspaper, the cover-story released shows only two people killed because somehow the in-definable concept of justice found a way and put the smackdown on the SCP.

TL:DR; The Foundation realizes an inter-dimensional newspaper could give them great information on how to contain SCPS...only if they let the SCPS out in the first place, something they would never intentionally do. Is their any way around this problem?  "	t5_2r4ni	True

1341771228.0	w8994	Why isn't 173 classified as Keter?	k3rn3	26	6	47	"Sorry if this is a dumb question, but it seems weird to me that [173](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-173) is Euclid.

[From the wiki:](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-object-classes)

&gt;**Euclid:** Euclid classification is generally applied to objects whose properties are not currently understood. Unlike Safe class objects, there are no reliable containment procedures on Euclid class objects: this may be because the object either does not obey known laws of nature and physics, or because its response to stimuli constantly changes. Objects classified as Euclid may be declined to Safe if a greater understanding of their properties is achieved.

On the other hand...

&gt;**Keter:** The strictest object class, Keter-class objects can only be handled by Class D personnel (see [Security Clearance Levels](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/security-clearance-levels)) except in special circumstances. Keter objects are naturally inimical to life and pose great difficulties in keeping them controlled, hence the use of Class D personnel in their maintenance. Keter objects fall into one of two categories: those that are of immense strategic value once controlled, or those that have been deemed impossible to destroy due to the nature of the artifact. In either case, the artifact is to be kept until its use has been ascertained and replicated in a more controlled environment, or until a method of ensuring the objects' permanent destruction is determined.
&gt;
&gt;Keter class objects are always inherently dangerous, despite the best containment procedures possible: the threat level may range from global armageddon to simply killing everything around it. A hand grenade with the pin removed may be considered Keter: a single mistake will cause casualties.

Since you only need to look away for it to start killing people, it (presumably) has to be handled by D-Class, and its behavior is well-understood, Euclid doesn't seem to be the right classification for 173."	t5_2r4ni	True

1339297018.0	uu2pf	SCP Roguelike	rosconotorigina	25	4	12	"This is just something I've been thinking about for a little while. For those of you who don't know what a roguelike is, it's a tile based game usually characterized by dungeon crawling, randomized levels and loot, and permadeath. Examples include Nethack, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, and (to an extent) The Binding of Isaac.

Here's how I picture it: you are a Class-D about to receive your daily assignment, when suddenly, all Hell breaks loose. Somehow, all of the security systems have failed, and all of the SCPs can roam freely throughout the compound. It's up to you and you alone to either escape, destroy the compound, or discover and terminate the cause of the breach.

It might seem hopeless for a human to try to stand up against enemies like 173 or 682, and like in most roguelikes, you'll probably die a lot before you start making real progress.

But, as any roguelike fan can tell you, the difference between victory and yet another stupid death often lies in your character's equipment, and in the compromised SCP compound, there will be plenty of randomized loot to discover. 

You might find [268](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-268) and try to sneak past enemies. You could blast your way through enemies and obstacles using the [Pinwheel of Doom](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-161), and deal with the adverse side effects on your mental health.

You might meet and team up with other personnel, or even SCPs. I can imagine they would say things like ""I will help you escape this place if you bring me x, or kill SCP-y, or let me permanently drain your intelligence by 2.""

There is so much stuff to explore and interact with in the SCP universe, and I think it would be hard to jam it all into a 3D first person  type game, but I think with a simple tile-based roguelike, you could plan for many different interactions, and create a fun, scary, and challenging game that would never play the same twice."	t5_2r4ni	True

John and Willy took turns staring at the thing while I cleaned up the blood and shit from the floor with the mop. Just like I do almost every Tuesday, no real changes in the thing apart from how it's in a different spot every time we go in. I stop, lean slightly on the handle of my mop and wipe my brow with my wrist.

""He's been shitting extra for us today, it seems."" I crack a joke. Nobody laughs. Willy speaks quietly. ""Wiping my brow."" He kept his eyes on it and slowly moved his arm up to his head. ""Okay."" John said clearly, focusing on the thing. Willy wiped his forehead and eyes with his forearm, then focused again. ""Clean.""

The thing's taller than me. Taller than the three of us, actually. Smeared with that red and brown shit all over it's face- If you could call it a face, and it's hands are constantly outstretched and leaning against the wall or out into the open.
 
Used to work for the people who kept this fucking thing. Made a bad mistake and tried stealing the wrong thing and ..I've been here for months. They say my luck will eventually run out. I wish it would- I don't get paid, I just get told to come in and clean this thing's excrement. It's nothing from God's creation, and I know for a fact it's not just a statue.
 
The day was quiet and I was getting my work done in the morning. Two of us, this was before the required three-man teams boosted safety and survivability. I kept my eyes on it, the new guy did the same. I told him to keep his eyes on it and that the thing was supposedly very quick.

He made the misfortune of having long hair that got into his eyes. There wasn't even a sound to be made when he made his first mistake. The statue grabbed him by the base of the neck and twisted his head around past his shoulder. The poor guy gasped and blood gushed from his nose and mouth. He was dead already, just ..an involuntary motion.
 
I kept my eyes on it and cleared out of there. Fought the urge to tear up- I'd only seen a man die twice before, but ..The guy was just a kid. Killed four people in a drunk driving accident. In the few times we talked, he did nothing but talk about how sorry he was.
 
Don't suppose the universe cares. The Sculpture didn't. As I left, I heard scraping noises. I was chastised and given a stern glare by a few of the Foundation officials but they told me that the mistake was the other D-Class personnel's. They told me I would eventually earn my freedom.
 
So here I am, cleaning an alien statue's shit off the floor with a mop. John steps over to me to take the mop, changing out staring shifts with me. A fluke happens- One in a million. The man slips on a mass of shit and blood and begins to fall. He knocks over the bucket. I turn and immediately tried to help him up.
Willy began screaming.
 
He blinks.
 
Less than a minute. Willy's dead. I'm thrown against the wall and I lose feeling in my legs. I hit the floor and my body feels numb and cold already. John's dead. I'm twitching and gasping for air, squinting my eyes. I feel cold hands curl around my neck. I open my eyes.
 
It's staring right at me. Motionless. My back is broken. I have to keep my eyes open. A heavy drop of blood begins to gather on the thing's face, right above my eyes.."	t5_2r4ni	True

Whoever does this will die, wheather the cause of death being a car accident on the way to their destination or a heart attack from stress.

Please share any thoughts you have that could improve this (and if something like this already exists or not).

EDIT: updates

Containment procedures:  Mounted to wall in small locked room, under surveillance.

Description: Analog clock of unknown origin.  According to surveillance, it's hands always remain at 4:44, time of day unknown.  Whoever checks the time on this clock, SCP-X-1 will experiance extreme stress and attempt to reach it's destination.  He/she seems to use the nearest form of transportataion, from cars to roller blades that do not fit.  SCP-X-1 will try to reach the nearest form of transport by the quickest route.  The stress caused by SCP-X throws off all focus while moving, resulting in accidents.  Heart attacks re also frequent.  The increased adrenaline levels keep SCP-X-1 from being stoped by conventional doors and guards.  Tasers, stun guns and pepper spray has no effect.  If stopped, SCP-X-1 will go insane at a fast rate.  He/she will claim whatever/whomever keeping them from advancing is a demon.  After __ hours of containment,  SCP-X-1 will claim to be experiancing massive head pain.  Shortly after this point, he/she will bleed from the eyes and ears.  This will continue, even if the blood loss surpasses the amount of blood in the average human body. Then SCP-X-1 will die.  Autopsies have shown major brain damage, injuries only possible through massive head tramua.

*A D-class has been escorted to SCP-X's cell.  He is forced to enter and sees a clock mounted to the wall and Dr. ___ facing away from it.  There is a chair facing him.*

Dr. ___: Please sit here.

D-class:  Why?  I don't have any tests planned for today.

EDIT: Presented as SCP-####-J. 

Special Containment Procedures:  Each subsequently filed SCP number must be one more then the SCP proceeding it. No more 'finding an empty slot'. A gap in numbers while viewing the actual database will be sufficient to trigger the anomaly. 

Description: SCP-#### is an infohazard contained in the actual SCP database itself. Any numerical gaps will cause viewers to have a strong complusion to fill in the numbers with fictional SCPS, drawing on the author's previous knowledge of Foundation history and SCPS for creative inspiration. 

This inspiration has provided valuable real-world intel now used in many real SCPS. For example, Agent Smithson, the second victim, wrote of several ways to contain flying mice, four of which are now in use as backup systems for seven different SCPS. 

As several Foundation personell have intimate knowledge of various memetic hazards, SCP-#### must be carefully controlled. See Addendum 1. 

(This means no using SCP-#### to 'juice' your brain and get a raise. This means you, EVERYONE. - O7)

The anomaly is able to recognize job classification positions. As such, it can be nuetralized by firing the employee. However, as Foundation employees are considered to be valuable assets, firings are not to be taken likely. Also, many firings are often fatal due to the needs of the job and the Foundation will not kill a man simply to destroy an infectious meme. 

See Case File #1: Assistant Researcher Johannseberg was removed from his position and assigned as a janitor. He did not neglect his janitorial duties in favor of writing fictional SCPS. 

This leads the Foundation to suspect SCP-#### has been created by an enemy force in order to destroy our potential. The increase in creative SCP containments is quite possibly an unintended side effect. 

(""Or simply an intended one. We've locked down [REDACTED] SCPS with the weird shit our lazy fanfiction agents came up with. Some of the groups do hate us, yes but they don't want to see our stuff escape and turn the world into [REDACTED]."" - Doctor Andrews.)

Addendum 1: Reasercher Addison was hired to invent new containment procedures long before SCP-#### was discovered. Under controlled conditions, she was exposed to the phenomenon. However, another iteration of the phenomenon's knowledge was discovered. Instead of inventing new SCPs and related contianment procedures, she invented new breaching possibillties. Furthermore, Addison worked on four different cognitohazards and simply inventing a new escape procedure caused one of them -to- escape four 99 (ninety-nine) minutes. Fourteen people exploded.

(""The researchers who neglected to investigate just what Addison was hired to CONTAIN have been used to test the heretofore unknown exploding potential of the infohazard. They blew up real good. Let this be a warning."" - Dr. Andrews)

**Item #:** SCP-286

**Object Class:** Safe (Reclassification to Euclid pending O-5 approval)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-286 is to be isolated, through the use of an electric fence and multiple warning signs. At least two guards must be posted at the front gate to the enclosure at all times. All safety precautions should be maintained under the guise of harmful radon emissions.

No unauthorized interaction with SCP-286-1 is to be made, and any offenders will be severely reprimanded, if not terminated. Only D-Class are permitted to make purchases, under appropriate testing conditions.

All instances of SCP-286-2 are to be recorded, catalogued and stored in standard Foundation storage lockers, and can be removed with prior permission for testing.

**Description:** SCP-286 is an abandoned convienience store and pharmacy, located 6 kilometers from ██████, ██. The exterior of the building suffers extensive structural damage, and one corner of the building is completely caved in. A broken neon sign reads ""PHARMACY"" on the front. This, with the architectural style, indicates the building was built in the 60's.

SCP-286 displays three unique anomalies:

* The building appears clean and pristine on the interior. Structural damage appears to be intentional architectural oddities, and when SCP-286-1 was questioned about it, he merely responded, ""I dunno. Pretty cool, huh?""

* The products in the store are not any known brand, and the products themselves are made of various body parts. Nerve endings are sold as ""LICORICE"", and bags of ""POTATO CHIPS"" contain flakes of dead skin. It has been found that not all bags contain body parts; On several occasions, packages were found containing [REDACTED] The origin of the substances remained unknown.

* A Caucasian male in his late 30's stands behind the counter (Hereby referred to as SCP-286-1) This man refers to himself as ""The Pharmacist"". Any damage inflicted upon him will not affect his ability to function, and he has been known to happily respond to questions, even through intense interrogation and [REDACTED]. Any time SCP-286-1 is left unobserved, all bodily/mental harm vanishes. Even when killed, SCP-286-1 will be found completely repaired and standing behind the counter. SCP-286-1 is responsible for retrieving and selling instances of SCP-286-2, and only he can do this. 

SCP-286-1 will comply with any request for sale items, including medication, with only two known exceptions (See Test Log 8-27). Upon receiving a request, SCP-286-1 will enter the pharmacy ""pill room"" at the back. Attempts to follow SCP-286-1 into this room have resulted in agents exiting the front door of SCP-286.

When SCP-286-1 returns, he will ""sell"" the product to the costumer. When this happens, part of the customer's body will disappear, as ""payment."" It has been found that the amount of the body that is taken directly relates to the value and rarity of the item. Common medications, like Advil and Tylenol, have been purchased for little more than a few dead skin flakes. However, upon requesting SCP-500, Dr.█████'s entire body was consumed, and SCP-286 remarked, ""Sorry, that's not enough."" The subject then refused to take a D-Class as payment, stating that ""He's not the customer. Dr.█████ was.""

In addition to medication, SCP-286-1 has been known to sell other items, too. Anything that can fit inside a pill bottle can be sold by SCP-286-1, including human blood and bullets. The subject is also able to sell the bodily fluids of specific individuals. The process by which this is accomplished is unknown.

SCP-286 came to the Foundation's attention after numerous reports of teenagers 'buying' scientifically impossible drugs at an abandoned building. Foundation Agents were able to quickly acquire the building and set up a solid cover story, discovering the anomalous nature of the structure quickly. All involved were given Class-B Amnesiacs.

***~ Interview Log 286-1***

**Interviewee:** SCP-286-1

**Interviewer:** Dr. Anderson ***[If this needs to be blacked out, I'll do that. But Dr. Anderson is my character, if you could call it that, so I'm leaving him uncensored for now.]***

**Foreward:** *I hope to find out the subjects origin, any data we can link to an actual person, and a general concept about the subject's existence.* ~Dr. Anderson.

**[Begin log at 00:00:01]**

**Dr. Anderson:** Now, SCP-286-1. Please take a seat.

**SCP-286-1:** No thank you. I can't leave my post. And please don't call me that, I'm the Pharmacist.

**Dr. Anderson:** Very well. Tell me, do you have a name?

**SCP-286-1:** I'm the Pharmacist.

**Dr. Anderson:** Alright, what do you do here?

**SCP-286-1:** I live here. I work here. It's a great job! I love what I do.

**Dr. Anderson:** Are you aware of the unusual properties of this building?

**SCP-286-1:** No, seems pretty normal to me.

**Dr. Anderson:** Alright, then. Let's get back to you. Where were you born?

**SCP-286-1:** I was... (Subject's expression darkens.) I don't know. I don't remember. (Subject becomes panicked and frantic.) Who am I? WHERE AM I? 

**[00.04.36] (Subject attacks Dr. Anderson, who manages to shake him off and neutralize subject with a tranquilizer dart.)
**
**[00.05.14] (Dr. Anderson is removed from the room.)**

**[End log at 00.05.20]**

**Closing Statement:** Upon reentry to the building, SCP-286-1 was found standing calmly behind the desk. He denied any memory of the events of the interview.

*That went well. We can see that, since the subject showed considerable distress as to his identity, this might have been a normal man converted into some kind of entity by force. I'd recommend a psychiatric evaluation for the subject.* ~Dr. Anderson

The story so far:

I woke up to the beeping of my alarm clock, and blindly slapped at it until it stopped.  I rolled out of bed and threw some clothes on, and walk out of my room into the hall.  I looked to my left, and saw scp-173 facing me, about 10 feet away. ""Fuck!"" I squinted closely, to prevent blinking. I'm a trained Foundation agent, I know my shit. I slowly back into my room. I see nothing through the doorway, but I know he's as close as he can get to it without me seeing him. From under my pillow I retrieve my pocket mirror. This was the only tool I ever had under my bed, and it has saved my life a couple of times. Once, when I faced a weeping angel, it had worked, so I thought to myself, 'Why not now?' So I put the mirror on a stand, directed it towards the statue, and blinked. It turns out I was wrong. He was now inches away from me, as close as he could be without snapping my neck. This is going to be harder than I thought. Picking up the mirror, carefully, I kept my eye on him as I looked around for my phone. I need foundation backup ASAP, even if it risks termination. But they wouldn't terminate me, would they? It's not like I'm some lowly Class-D. Well I spotted my phone but it was too far behind me for me to get it without losing eye contact with the statue. I also realized that in order to dial the number I would have to stop looking at him, and he was far too close for me to risk losing eye contact. I decided to risk slowly walking backwards towards the phone. I had to be careful not to trip over anything, but there was no way to tell if one object could render me downed and likely dead. Suddenly I heard a crash. It came from behind me. I was curious, as behind me was a closet full of watermelons. They toppled all over the floor, but despite the distraction, I kept 173 in my peripheral vision. As I grabbed for my phone, I realized what caused my watermelons to fall. It was a black man.  While I had no idea how a black guy got into my closet, I knew that this was a huge stroke of luck for me. All I had to do was make him understand the severity of this situation, and I would be able to live through this encounter. I said to him, ""EY DOG, HELP ME OUT WITH THE ESS SEE PEE AND I SCORE YOU DOLLAR LIKE NO OTHA HOLLA HOLLA"".  Offended by my choice of words, the man ignored me and went to examine the statue more closely. I tried to explain what it was to him, and when I finished telling him about it he said, ""Dammit, you woke up before 173 could kill you."" I was dumbfounded. Who would want to kill me? It was then I saw the sparkle of an amulet dangling around the man's neck. I realized that I wasn't looking at 173 anymore, and neither was he. I quickly looked back at the statue to see it inches away from the black man. Whether or not he wanted me dead, I knew that now he needed me if he wanted to live. I said to him, ""Look behind you"".  The black man replied, ""You know, I've been in this body for more than a month. I've always wanted to try this."" He took off his [amulet](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-963) and hung it around 173's neck. After a brief moment the black man chuckled to himself and turned to face me.

Thus a D-Class must be ""Sacrificed"" for lack of a better word every month.
I got the idea after I bought this: http://i.imgur.com/KhraQ79.jpg from a gift shop. If people like this I can make a true scp entry for it.

Geez, didn't expect this much feedback, But thanks for it! I've made an SCP entry for it here:

SCP-#### Is to be kept In a Thermal chamber, Being able to hold temperatures at least 2,000 degrees Celsius. When being used for testing purposes, a drone is to approach SCP-#### and place it in a box lined with lead, from there it is to stay in a separate, recorded room approximately 20 by 20 feet, about a half mile away from the observation room, where the same drone is to preform the tests given to it by the observers.
SCP-#### Is an egg approximately 5 inches tall and 3 inches wide, It appears to  be made of a mixture of onyx, and a mystery substance that does not appear to be of organic material found on earth. It was discovered in [DATA REDACTED] from the [DATA REDACTED] Gift Shop, the fire caused by the contact was quickly covered up as a forest fire by the Foundation. However, the egg, when approached by a living organism (It appears to classify a living organism by whether or not it has Systems within it's body, As plantlife and dead bodies will not work. How it can identify this is currently under study.) The egg will slowly heat up, causing extreme temperatures, highest recorded being about 3200 degrees Celsius. During this time, Security Cameras will stop working due to overheating. After this time the body of the organism will be severely charred, even more so than the temperature of the room would allow. Afterwords, the egg will change color to the color of the thing it has absorbed, as an example, after a pig was ""absorbed"" by the egg, it changed into a Pinkish color, until it changed back to it's original brown/green color after a 24 hour cool-off period. The egg does not appear to need the animals, But it seems that the longer without an organism, the hotter the peak temperature will be upon the next absorbtion will become. (Longest wait was 2 weeks, reaching the 3200 degrees Celsius peak.)

Inside is a bunker and insructions to fire on a location in Antarctica, probably to stop some sort of monster. There's also instructions to send the facility back in time again on the same date as before, to prevent the monster from rising in the past. The catch is, the missiles are based on theoretical physics and don't come with instructions on how to reproduce them, and are running out. The place shows sign of decay and has been passed down for thousands of years, so it's almost falling apart.

**Object Class – Safe**

**Special Containment Procedures:** All known vessels containing SCP-XXXX in a liquid state must be refrigerated at a temperature of exactly 3.44 degrees Celsius. Vessels containing solid SCP-XXXX must be stored inside of conventional pharmacy pill containers inside of a safe that is room temperature and completely dry. Refrigerators and containment safes must be locked at all times. The removal of SCP-XXXX from containment is strictly forbidden unless testing has been cleared by an O3 official. 

Instances of SCP-XXXX-1 must be tranquilized and properly restrained before transportation to site 19 the facility by aerial vehicle.  Undeveloped instances of SCP-XXXX-1 must be monitored and tracked at all times in case of spontaneous transformation. All witnesses of SCP-XXXX-1 must be treated by a Class A Amnesiac. Images or video depicting SCP-XXXX-1 are to censored proper. 

**Description:** SCP-XXXX is a collection of various drugs contained in pills, vials and syringes containing a synthetic pharmaceutical chemical, [REDACTED]. The drugs in question were confiscated from the illegal website [REDACTED] selling drugs for common and uncommon ailments, completely unregulated. The absence of regulation is speculated to be what allowed for the spread of the chemical. The chemical in question is common to all of the confiscated drugs, according to initial analysis and testing. According to studies conducted in the facility, it is chemically similar to a natural biological hormone that is found in the construction of DNA strands inside of cells. 

SCP-XXXX is relatively stable when used by the majority of the public, and medicines containing SCP-XXXX work as intended, except by subjects of the rare blood type [REDACTED]. These subjects are now referred to as SCP-XXXX-1. 

When SCP-XXXX-1 uses SCP-XXXX, violent biological changes begin to occur within the physical complexion as well as structure of the body. Not all cases are instant; some cases resulting from prolonged use of SCP-XXXX. These changes include rapid growth in the length of the femur, fibula and tibia, enlargement of the metatarsals and length increases in the phalanges. Similar growth patterns occur in the humerus, radius and ulna. Cranial structure is burst outward and the head becomes longer and wider to facilitate the widening of the jaw. In advanced cases, the neck becomes extremely elongated, and hands/feet take the form of paw-like structures. The end of the spinal cord becomes a “tail” and extrudes from the pelvis. This form has radically quicker movement and possesses strength dwarfing that of a normal human body.

Instances of SCP-XXXX-1 exhibit fits of rage and extreme pain when the biological changes occur. In most cases, instances of SCP-XXXX-1 die of blood loss, cardiac arrest, violent strokes or shock before the transformation is complete. Once transformed completely into the “primitive form” SCP-XXXX-1 seeks humans and kills them by means of sufficient trauma to the head, trauma to the ribcage and vital organs, decapitation, or ripping the esophagus from the neck of victims. It has been observed that [REDACTED] blood types are prioritized by SCP-XXXX-1.

I'm open to all critiques. If anyone would love to refine and use this idea for the foundation wiki, go right ahead. Just make sure to cite me!

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The wall containing SCP-1439 is to be kept in a standard holding cell. No special containment procedures seem to be necessary as the object is not mobile or openly hostile. Access is open to all Level 1 or higher security clearances but personnel should always be accompanied by at least one other personnel member in case of attack. Any use of D-Class personnel for experimentation should be registered with Dr.Chen. 

**Description:** SCP-1439 appears to be a white-painted cinder block wall measuring 2.5x4.2 meters. Under dormant circumstances it appears completely normal but when a living object approaches within its radius of detection a white arm up to the elbow will sprout from the wall and begin to beckon the person forward. If approached the wall will sprout more hands; at the point at which the person is within its reach the hands will begin to caress and touch the subject. As it pets the subject a male baritone voice will begin to reverberate from the concrete giggling and cooing. Over time the hands will become more aggressive, poking and grabbing until eventually it begins to try and pull the subject into the wall. Upon total absorption a new pair of hands will sprout from the wall. It is unclear how many hands were originally on the wall but the current number appears to be twenty-eight.

SCP-1439 was recovered from a small town 20km north of Seattle, WA, United States of America on 02/24/08 after a video was posted to the popular video hosting site youtube.com of the SCP-1439 in action. It was discovered that the object had been known to the owners of a bar next to the alley in which SCP-1439 was found and it had been used for entertainment.  Upon discovery by embedded agents within the youtube.com moderator team the video was wiped and a team was sent to the site where all bar employees and other civilians known to have contact with SCP-1439 were given Class-B amnesiacs. Upon establishing that it was safe to move SCP-1439 it was transferred to Storage Site- 148

SCP-1439 appears to show some amount of sentience, using the hands to gesticulate. It has been found to mimic the gestures of any person within its range of detection. Often antagonizing or mocking personnel. All attempts to communicate with SCP-1439 have failed not due to lack of understanding, it seems to have full comprehension of human speech, but because it’s personality is antagonistic, often using rude hand gestures and  even making faces through contortion of its hands to mock researchers. Attempts to teach SCP-1439 sign language have also failed as the only phrases it seems willing to learn are derogatory terms or rude gestures.

**Research Log for SCP-1439:**

* D-Class subject told to approach SCP-1439, SCP absorbs them, 34.2 seconds later another pair of hands emerge from the wall.

* D-Class subject #95062 brought into contact with SCP-1439, #95062 was missing her right arm from a motorcycle crash some years earlier. Upon absorption only one arm emerged showing that there was some correlation between the people and the hands

* D-Class subject #29456 introduced to test chamber. #29456 had both arms but was born with a deformed hand, having only three fingers and a thumb fused to the hand. Upon absorption two hands appeared in 20.4 seconds however no marks of imperfections were found in the pair. All trace of the deformation had apparently been erased and replaced with a pair of completely uniform hands matching all the rest on the wall.

* Level-1 Security Clearance personnel introduced tried to engage in communication with the wall. At first no reaction was found but after 20 minutes a pair of hands emerged from the wall and began to mimic the gestures of the researcher. 

* Researcher Stevenson was brought in due to his knowledge of sign language, after 23 minutes he managed to retain SCP-1439’s attention but was unable to get it to cooperate in learning sign language; instead it mocked him and showed rude gestures. After 20 minutes of abuse by SCP-1439 Stevenson lost his temper and signed the derogatory sign for [Redacted]. SCP-1439 appeared to understand the meaning of the sign and began to repeat it back. Continued experimentation showed great willingness and ability to learn offensive words and phrase.

* Research dog “Missy.” Introduced to containment chamber. A hand emerged and beckoned Missy forward till it was in touching range at which the hands began to pet and scratch the dog. No attempt to grab or attack the animal was made and upon removing Missy SCP-1439 was seen to wave goodbye. Permission to reintroduce Missy for continued play denied.

* D-Class subject #39458 used as bait while two other personnel used the distraction to saw off a hand from the wall. Upon examination the limb was found to be made entirely of the same kind of concrete as SCP-1439 with no discernible anomalies. SCP-1439 remained dormant for the next three weeks despite attempts to rouse it; it appeared to be, “pouting.”

* D-Class subject #78351 was introduced to containment chamber. #78351 had a tattoo on the back of his hand. Upon absorption SCP-1439 was observed, At 20 minutes precisely a pair of arms emerged. No distinguishing marks were found.

* D-Class subject #44898 was introduced to SCP-1439. At 20% absorption a retrieval team was sent in to rescue #44898. Attempt was unsuccessful as his body seemed to have fused to the concrete. #44898 was then terminated at which point fusion was ceased by SCP-1439. #44898's body requisitioned for research.

* Research request denied; Dr. Chen is not to be allowed children for testing. *Note: Come on man, that's messed up*

**Incident Report:**

Report # 1439-1: Researcher Kent reports while interacting with SCP-1439 it stole a lighter from his pocket. Sign posted warning researchers not to keep personal effects while working with SCP-1439.

Report # 1439-2: Researcher Hastings reported KIA; while interacting with SCP-1439 Hastings became entangled. Recovery team deployed but was unsuccessful. SCP-1439 sustained damages as follows: several chips to paint on the front of the wall, three arms destroyed while trying to save Researcher Hastings. Rescue attempt unsuccessful and Agents Perlman, Wycliffe and Johnson reported injuries when SCP-1439 claimed a pick meant to break Hastings free and used the implement to defend itself from attack.

""Greetings Agent Mark.

We have become aware of your incident that caused the loss of both of your legs from the knees down and the partial damage to your left arm. While we regret and honor your loss in service to the Foundation, we still need you.

Please bear with us. You have been told you will receive a pension. You have been told you will retire nicely to a small village in your favored country.

This is true. But your service to the Foundation is not over. Not by a long shot. There is...services we must ask of you. If you do not wish to perform these services, please destroy this letter.

Please do not report this letter. We will not be found. We cannot be found. If we are found, many people will die.

Further reading is only possible for the willing; may the red lines honor the sky.

There is a phenomenon containable only if a certain number of people know of it's danger. We will not report on it via the usual way. We will not tell the Foundation proper of it. We are people like you, injured but with our minds, who are still part of the Foundation. Perhaps some of us are Overseers. Perhaps not. You will never know.

The phenomenon will destroy all healthy, moral agents. It... preys on their nobility. With every success it grows stronger. Rescue five children from werewolves in Pheonix? Stronger. Rescue a nurse from an infohazard in Tuskanga? Stronger. One day, the agent just doesn't wake up and he's lost in a mad fantasy world where he's the ultimate agent, rescuing all, perfect in any way. Until it rebounds on him and ... well, one of the threats he imagines fighting takes him. For real.

We've had an agent disassembled proton by proton. Irradiated an entire medical wing, killing 99. Another agent, well he's just skin now. A third vanished during a medical checkup and was found...well, was seen...oribiting...you get the idea.

Again, we touch on why I haven't reported this to you in the official fashion. Descriptions. Containment procedures. Event logs. It's quite possible the Foundation has devices that can detect this format. Somehow. We do not know. We cannot risk it. Even an Overseer keeps secrets from other Overseers. What if 05 can detect the format and did not tell 07? We would lose many. 

Yes, there are ways we could improve on keeping this phenomenon contained. But as mentioned above, we do not have the full resources of the Foundation. We do not have the full resources of our own bodies.

One last thing; this has been pointed out to me before. This sounds similar to a problem above. You may be wondering 'Me? One of the few who can contain this? Sounds like I'm at least partly the...ultimate agent'. I have no answer for this. We are working on this. Perhaps this is not real. Perhaps you are lost in a violent mad world of your own imagining. If so, we are sorry and we honor your loss.""

Utilize SCP 096.  Being that SCP 096 is essentially indestructible when angered, and destroys anything that activated it, as to leave no trace.  We have a few options:

Put it in a room with SCP 682 - Not recommended, as SCP 682 could destroy it without looking.  Terminates SCP 096, which isn't so bad anyway.

Put 682, 173 and 096 in a room together - not recommended, SCP 096 could be killed by 173.

SCP 173, covered in pictures of SCP 096 - this would be tricky to pull off, as no one would be able to view anything in the room for fear of activating 096, but looking at 173 would be required.  Perhaps an automated drone system?  Or coat pictures of 096 in an opaque, soluble wrapper, then spray them down with a solvent once they are with 682.  SCP 682 will be forced to look at 173 to prevent it from attacking, and will inadvertently view 096

Another plausable solution:

SCP 096 is placed in a containment chamber immediately adjacent to SCP 682.  SCP 682 is contained in it's acid solution, as normal.  A laser of variable intensity will project a live feed of 096's cell directly onto 682 corneas.  In the event 682 closes its eye(s), a higher intensity beam can be used to project the image through the eye lid or equivalent growth.

It is obviously very far from complete but I figured it would be cool to see it progress over time.

The lobby itself will be two floors as seen. There will be glass railings on the second floor and possibly some glass floors as well. The lobby desk will be in front of the middle room and there will be benches/tables in the lobby. The SCP logo will most likely be in the center of the lobby floor. There may be plants.

I also want some kind of ""SCP: Secure, Contain, Protect"" sign behind the lobby desk as well.

The lobby also won't be as ""square"" as seen and there will be rooms on the second floor (probably board rooms/meeting rooms) with glass windows. This is just a very basic layout for now.

Here is an updated shot. I added more lights and a raised part of the ground that the SCP logo will be on. Also added the railing and a temporary glass texture that came with UDK:

this is a kinda rough idea, but it's explained in a IF and Cause-and-Effect objective description style.
i do not know to to actually submit a official SCP article, im only here to conceptualize it.

**""The Blood Katana"" Hilt:**
object appears to be regular Hilt from a Japanese Katana with the actual part of the blade itself missing. the hilt is made of metal but is black in color.
in the middle of the grip of the hilt contains a blood-red crystal embedded inside with no way of removal.

the hilt contains 2 state: the active state and the dormant state. the hilt itself does not show any abnormal properties when observed or touched unless it is held in a sword-holding position as if the part of the blade is present, only then will it be active. when any human being(s) is/are holding the hilt, the blade hole on top of the hilt and the blood-red crystal will glow brightly red.

in it's active state, the hilt itself can become a Katana when thrusting the hilt onto any animal or human in a stabbing action when held. releasing the said held hilt during this time will return it back to it's dormant state, fading its red glow. when a 3rd party is stabbed, the non-existent part of the ""blade"" of the katana itself actually makes it's user feel as if it's cutting through into the 3rd parties' flesh despite not actually harming them. if user releases the hilt after stabbing a specimen, it will stay where it is stabbed in it's active state. however, it is important to note that after something is stabbed, it is impossible to remove the hilt without killing the specimen. when user tries to pull the hilt away from the 3rd party, the blood within the specimen will be all sucked up while molding into the shape of the katana's blade resulting the death of the 3rd party. result of this action leaves a completely paled body behind. autopsy proformed indicates there is not even a single cell of blood cell or plasma left in the system of the dead organism. **(#)**depending the amount of blood consumed by the sword, the blade itself can be manifest as a dagger, small sword, long sword. etc while having the katana hilt itself staying the same. **(#)**if the optimal amount of blood is achieved, it will manifest as a katana. **(#)**the smallest manifestation is a blade of a dagger.

blood that forms the blade stays liquid and stays in a consistent shape of a blade however they are in a unstable vibration state. the katana in this state can damage/cut anything that touches the edge of the blade. what forces keeping the blood in this shape has not been determined at this time. blood making up the part of the blade itself will continuously drip from the blade but it's whole volume will stay the same. cutting, and slicing and otherwise killing more organisms in this state has shown to increase it's sharpness and density further making it more powerful. the time the blade retains it's blood blade on the hilt lasts as long as 20 minutes-2 hours or longer depending on the size of animal stabbed, the amount and type of blood. after effect expiration, the blood simply gets sucked into the hilt's blade hole and consumed by the Hilt itself. after effect expiration, this whole process can than be activated again by ""stabbing"" the empty hilt onto another 3rd party specimen. 

**Overtakens:**
Overtakens are individuals who have used the the weapon itself exceedingly, they will begin to display a emotionless, and expressionless behaviors. shortly during onset of these symptoms, gradually they will become more and more quiet, talking less and less. as time passes, their psyche will slowly be consumed by the sword losing their ability to respond or think logically or emotionally on their own. eventually, they will start to indiscriminately killing anything in his/her path in order to ""feed"" the sword for more blood, however this is only a theory erected through observation on victims succumbing to this effect. it has also been theorized that, the Hilt itself contains a ""will"" or ""soul"" whose goal is to cut and take(Blood), but this ""will"" or ""soul"" is only waken through the active state. having the victim's psyche consumed, they will not talk or respond, only to coldly and swiftly kill anyone if they are close enough. Overtakens do not run but walks slowly toward their prey while staring coldly. overtakens, can also cut and block projectiles (guns, machine guns etc) making them extremely defensive and dangerous. the time it takes for the Hilt to consume the individual's psyche is unknown as it depends on age, personality and perhaps other factors. individuals who succumb to it's grasp cannot be stopped in anyway, the only known way is neutralizing the target with heavy fire power bypassing their defensive ability.

those who finished testing the hilt itself must be go through a mandatory supervised mental test every time carefully noting any psychological or personality changes. test results will be logged and analyzed. area used for testing must be secured, guarded and under surveillance. at least 3 guards will be present at the time of any testing.

**TL,DR**: hilt creates a blade on the hilt made of blood when stabbed and pulled from victim. causes it's user to coldly kill indiscriminately when personnel's psyche has been consumed upon overuse.

Now, saying that, going through several thousand pages is inefficient, so I'm asking for a little help and a review of an idea I had. Maybe it'll be a good one. 


SCP-725

The tome of knowledge

The book itself is a white, blank hardcover book with no markings. The pages are also blank from cover to cover, counting them has revealed anywhere from 203-460 pages, never the same count twice in a row. This appearance is only known when viewed through remote means (cameras, pictures, etc)

When viewed by a human, it takes the appearance of a book that can help them learn, relative to their intelligence and field of speciality. A college graduate would see a scholarly paper or book about their topic they graduated or are extremely interested in. A lower intelligence or mentally retarded person might see a middle school textbook, each person's view of the book is different and from their description, none of the books that they see have ever been printed.

With the reading of the book, it increases the overall intelligence of the reader, regardless of topic. When the user is finished reading the book they always put it in a location where it is still easily visible, but they do not look at it for a day. The next time they view it, the book has changed, to someone thing more advanced for them, the next step up of intelligence.

The idea is that the user starts to become compelled to learn more, to become smarter, but 3-5 stages in, the books shown start to become disturbing and dangerous. Like a medical doctor might start to see a book on how to analyze the human body through surgery while still alive. A psychologist might see a book on how to manipulate the minds of others through subtlety.

Eventually, the book starts to compel the user to start harming themselves or others in the pursuit of more knowledge it has to offer, such as an occult ritual that requires the sacrifice of a close friend to have the universe speak to you. Each iteration of the boo also becomes more ""evil"" as they see it, but no one cares. They eventually become so entwined with the pursuit of the books knowledge, come under the control of the book, doing whatever it's pages ask.

Notable examples could be a medical doctor that ended up trying to read the entrails of several d-level subjects; a mentally retarded d-level subject eating  his own flesh to permanently prevent a slide back into retardation, a college student of physics using his own blood to try to map the universe, or even a regular joe who got the farthest in the book, who's last iteration was simply ""KILL THEM ALL"" written once on every page.

~~Have in mind though, that this is a very hack-ish script made on a rush by someone not that experienced in JavaScript (me), so it is natural that it malfunctions, or works in an unexpected way. I also didn't take into account other variations of SCPs (it doesn't even check for lowercase scp-XXX). If someone wants to make fixes so as to include these, feel free to do so.~~

The script now can easily detect most SCP variants and can linkify lowercase or even numbers without having ""SCP-"" behind them.

~~Also, if the mods are interested in including the script in this subreddit, feel free to do so, but I'd check for better quality scripts first.~~

SCP-1155 ""Aftertaste"" 

Item #: SCP-1155

Object Class: Euclid                                                       [Image](http://www.tias.com/stores/jjt/pictures/aaa433a.jpg)

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1155 is to be stored in a containment locker in a 20m x 20m x 20m chamber. At no time are personnel allowed within the chamber without being properly hydrated first, comsuming at least ten eight-ounce glasses of water before entering. Before being permitted to enter SCP-1155's containment chamber, personnel must submit to a physical exam where the examiner must determine the subject's weight and fluid absorption rate. Using these measurements, the examiner can determine how long a subject can be within SCP-1155's vicinity without being effected by SCP-1155's anomalous properties.

Description: SCP-1155 is an antique crystal drinking glass of unknown origin. It was recovered from the ██████ ███ Auction House where it was claimed to have been owned by [DATA EXPUNGED].

SCP-1155 was brought to the foundation's attention after an incident during which the entire attendance at the auction, a total of ██ people, died of various causes, the majority being either acute dehydration or blood loss due to assorted blunt-force trauma, bite marks and lacerations, and one death by [DATA EXPUNGED].

Upon examination of the glass, SCP-1155 shows no remarkable properties. On the bottom of the glass, inscribed with acid sketching, are the words ""Impotable and Impossible - Kyet"" this is proposed to be the artist's signature, yet matches no currently known glassware artist. It is important to note that no country of origin is given, which could suggest that the glass was made prior to 1891, when companies were first required to provide a country of origin in their signatures.

People who drink any sort of liquid from SCP-1155 claim the taste of the liquid to be slightly sour or metallic. This is often accompanied by nausea and occasionally vomiting.

The change in taste is observed only from those who drink from SCP-1155. If the liquid inside the glass is poured to a different glass, the alteration in taste does not transfer with the liquid.

When any person is within approxomately 10 meters of SCP-1155, they will begin to dehydrate at an accelarated rate of around 250% their usual fluid absorption rate. Subjects report no discomfort
during this process. While a person is within SCP-1155's area of effect and dehydrating, SCP-1155 will appear to slowly fill with a translucent, light-yellow liquid similar in consistency to bile. Any attempts to access this liquid while the glass is filling results in the liquid disappearing before it can be touched or poured. 

When a person starts to feel the usual effects of complete dehydration, the subject will actively seek out a liquid to drink. Subjects will become agitated and show extreme discomfort when restrained from actively pursuing a liquid. In this state, the subject, now called SCP-1155-X (X being any number, as this property can effect a seemly limitless amount of people, and only seems to effect humans), when locating and consuming a drink that isn't the liquid contained within SCP-1155, will claim that the drink has a horrid aftertaste and smell similar to rotting flesh and feces. Occasionally, subjects may hallucinate changes in the liquid's texture or consistency, including curdling of the liquid, liquid turning into sand or ashes, mold or other growths, and body parts like human eyeballs or insects in the liquid. The subjects will vomit said liquid shortly after consuming it, furthering their dehydration. The aftertaste and smell is only detectable to the subjects, and will grow worse the longer SCP-1155-X goes without drinking all of the liquid within SCP-1155. It seems possible to keep a subject alive via intravenous hydration, but this is not recommended (See Addendum-1155-A). If a liquid is not found or kept from the subject, they will ultimately die of dehydration.  

If the subject finds SCP-1155, they will see SCP-1155's contained liquid as their favorite drink and proceed to drink all of it. Once it all is consumed, the subject will enter a state of calm and note that it is over, repeatedly attempting or requesting to leave SCP-1155's area of effect. If the subject succeeds in leaving the area, they will immediately succumb to what is unanimously described as a ""Horrific, burning pain from every nerve in their body"". The subjects blood will appear to literally boil, causing capillaries and veins to expand and burst from steam and pressure. The subject dies shortly after this, even if they return to SCP-1155's area of effect. However, if a subject remains within SCP-1155's vicinity, they will remain in a state of intense calm and happiness. It is to be noted that the subject will become fully hydrated after consuming all of the liquid within SCP-1155, but the effects of rapid dehydration will repeat in an infinite cycle.

If more than one person is within the range of SCP-1155, they will both experience the increased dehydration and seeking of liquids, however, if multiple subjects find SCP-1155, they will become incredibly violent and primeval towards each other, using fists, teeth and nails to keep others from reaching it, regardless of prior disposition to one another and personality.

If the contents of SCP-1155 are not consumed entirely by one person, the glass will remain empty until complete dehydration occurs in all individuals, wherein it will refill with the liquid and the subjects will return to seeking out something to drink.

Addendum-1155-A:

A number of experiments are carried out to show SCP-1155's reaction to various changes in scenario. These experiments are carried out through usage of closed-circuit cameras.  

Subject D-9964 is exposed to SCP-1155. After becoming completely dehydrated, subject's intravenous hydration system is switched on via a remote system.

D-9964 reports tasting a combination of raw sewage and gasoline shortly after activation. (Considerable amount of concern is given as to how the subject knows what these things taste like). Subject is seen retching, but nothing is being expelled. Subject is seen removing the IV from his arm and rushing towards SCP-1155 and drinking the contents in a few gulps.

He then claims that its all better now, the taste is gone but he wants to use the bathroom. Request denied. Subject becomes restless and makes several attempts to open the door manually and fails. Subject then attempts to call security in by trying to shatter SCP-1155. As security officers rush in to prevent this, the subject throws SCP-1155, which does not break the fine crystal glass. While being restrained, D-9964 breaks away from security and runs out of the chamber and falls over screaming and dies shortly after of blood loss and third degree burns. 

*Note: Okay, maybe we should try restraining the IV better... I'll go get a mop. - Dr. ██████*

Experiment is repeated with subject D-9975, using duct tape wrapped around the arm several times to secure the IV in place and prevent removal.

D-9975 immediately responds negatively when the IV is switched on, claiming that there is a taste in his mouth that tastes like ""ass"", and would not give a more detailed description.

*Note: Seriously, I hate these [EXPLETIVE OMITTED]ing D-classes. We should only take death row inmates who have at least completed high school. - Dr. ██████*

D-9975 attempts to remove IV and fails. He is seen growing incredibly agitated and is dry heaving every few seconds. D-9975 then attempts to bite off his own arm to remove the IV from his body, but is unable to do so due to the blood getting in his mouth causing him to vomit. Test aborted when subject is seen attempting to snap his arm off at the elbow by bending it across his knee.

Test repeated a third time. Fed up with the ignorant behavior of the D-classes, Dr. ██████ requests to be the subject for the final test. Partly because of paperwork for another D-class not being filed and partly because of Dr. ██████ being pretty disliked among O5, the request was granted. Dr ██████ was placed in a specialized container that has an inner wall that separated him from SCP-1155 while still being within its area of effect. The IV is secured using a molded cast that prevents removal of the IV and destruction of the arm. As soon as the subject reaches complete dehydration, the IV system is activated. The subject is seen to immediately appear in extreme amounts of discomfort. Subject describes the taste as ""The worst possible thing I could ever imagine tasting. Like sticking my face, open-mouthed, into a pile of ground-up corpses topped in excrement."" Subject appears confused as to how he knows what that would taste like. Subject begins pacing, stopping occasionally to vomit nothing and continue pacing. After about ten minutes, subject appears frantic, pacing fast and sobbing slightly, clawing at the wall that separates him from SCP-1155. Subject eventually curls into a ball on the floor, away from the camera, and appears to be doing nothing. Light sobs can be heard occasionally. About 30 minutes later, test was aborted when subject appeared to be still. It was later found that the subject ripped out his own tongue in order to stop the taste, but ended up effectively drowning on his own blood. Testing on SCP-1155 halted.

I found your subreddit, and would love you guys to give me some assistance. Since she doesn't have a number, I've taken to calling her ""X"" for the time being.


SCP ""X"" is a shapeshifter, approximately 22 years of age. Her abilities include the manipulation of the cerebrum of one or more ""Hosts"" by sexually manipulating them; As a shapeshifter, she can transform into almost any object as long as she has had contact with it once. It is unknown whether or not she is susceptible to diseases or ailments; as she can transfer between hosts at will, provided she has established temporal connection with said host.

It is reccomended that an EMP barrier be established between the subject and Lab personnel attempting to further research X, as well as temporal interference equipment attached to X before further contact is established. She is capable of higher mental capacities, but only in the spectral sense, that is she can only communicate through dreams. Subjects must be closely monitored as they could exhibit certain undesired after-effects, such as recklessness, insanity, or suicidal tendencies, as well as hyper-arousal to stimuli.

Files recovered from Nog-po Province have described experiments with Prison Camp inmates, mostly physical malformations, however, File 4434 was recovered partially damaged from a destroyed filing cabinet. A single breakthrough was achieved in 1997 with the aid of Iranian and Russian Scientists alongside North Korean doctors and staff. A female prisoner had her brain removed and was injected with eggs from Echinococcosis parasites, and reattached the brain, allowing her to recover. Unlike most cases of paricital infection, The body accepted the larvae. How temporal and shape shifting abilities were achieved is unknown. However, it is assumed that the parasites played a factor in this.

X has the ability to create a ""doorway"", a temporal connection between hosts If she assumes the idea that copulation between her and her host will assuage any fear from their minds and ensure a new host is readily available at her disposal. Instances physical contact, even eye contact with X may lead to a series of night terrors, often including Necrophilia and Morbid sexual fantasies, mainly involving the host and the parasite. Most instances end up with the subject waking up, and describing a ""burnt/rotting flesh smell"" in their noses, as well as the feeling of hopelessness and severe worthlessness. As time progresses, the mental state of the host deteriorates to a point of psychosis. At this point, X will invade the host's mind and begin to control them temporally. This can lead to undesired results and possible containment breach of the SCP.

Interaction with SCP X is generally 100 percent fatal without safeguards, and even then, they are not a guarantee against her abilities. Further preventative measures have yet to be developed; until then, SCP X MUST NOT be allowed to have unauthorized interaction with Class D's or Security personnel without Level 4A clearance from the O-5s."	t5_2r4ni	True

All that being said, we have been going in order from 001 and have sorted through the first 45 or so SCP's (basically going out of order would be a pain as far as organization goes). 

Since this is a pretty long process, we want to hear from you guys on your favorite SCP's that we could use for missions.

Fifteen (15) obsidian shards which replicate when placed into a host body (best works on humans, as shards increase considerably in number and size). The most preferred method (which yields the most results) is by causing a puncture wound with it, and keeping the shard deep into the wound. 

The conversion of the shards causes ~~considerable~~ intense pain to the host, as the nerves are replaced with a crystalline structure which does a similar job, followed by replacement of muscle tissue and skin. Bones stay intact, possibly due to the calcium composition. This conversion would affect the entire body, creating a living ""Golem"" of obsidian, designated as SCP-XXXX-2.

The entire conversion period lasts up to fifteen (15) days, depending on the area initially affected. Amputation is required to stop spread of conversion. By doing so would break said limb into small shards like the original shard. 

If arm is whipped out quickly (usually due to pain and/or panic), loose shards would deploy as projectiles, which is viable to spread more shards between people.

-An inanimate object, cube or sphere, made of unknown, magnetic material similar to metal.

-The SCP slowly, degrades the surface of any material it comes in contact with, eventually completely destroying the material, including earth.

-SCP must be contained in a room using large magnets to suspend it in the air to prevent the object from degrading the surface of the room's floor.

-Materials within a short range (100 feet or less) also suffer degradation over a period of weeks or months. The suspension magnets are to be replaced every two months. Personnel must be kept a distance of 100+ feet at all times and are to be rotated out of their shifts every month.

-Humans that that remain in the SCP's nearby presence for an extended period of time (at least a few hours) suffer from what appears to be rotting of the flesh.

Awken	14	0	14	"I remember reading about it my first time through the SCP wiki, and I can't remember the number. At first I thought it was one of the SCP-001 proposals, but thats not the case. Does anyone know what I'm talking about?

I remember that it was a thing that, around the time the world ""switched from black and white to colour film"", changed the world itself from black and white to colour, or at least our perception of the world, I don't remember if it physically changed the world or just how we saw it. It it was the latter, it would have massive memetic properties, probably at least equal to SCP-55. The other thing I remember is that no one remembers the change happening, except for whomever wrote the report.

Subject resembles a mass of pink (bubblegum) colored flesh, that possesses  the physiology of an amoeba. Subject demonstrates the ability to warp and control it's density, mass, and viscosity. This results in a minor form of shapeshifting, though it displays the inability to change color. Subject was last seen in the form of an oblong spherical disk of varying size, appearing to have the face of a grinning pig.

Subject is mobile via rolling, and capable of violently inverting its form to ""bounce"" at a height of 6-12 feet. Attempted capture is near impossible without a freezing unit, as the subject can simply ""melt"" through any form of capture.

Subject's main form of action is to attach itself to any nearby sign of life, though experiments show it tends to remain fixated on one target until said target expires. After it bonds to the target, through some unknown means, it alters the structure of targets DNA, merging it with its own. After assimilating with the target, it morphs itself into a characterized version of the host, bearing the face of a pig. It remains in this state until the host has been ""digested,"" and then returns to its original state.

Subject possesses a form of telepathic communication, when in contact with any form of life. It's interactions have been heard in different voices, in monotone, but usually consist of the same phrases, such as:

* ""Do not struggle.""
* ""Become one with the others.""
* ""Many have succumbed. You will, soon.""
* ""I am the end that has been foreseen.""
* ""Oink."" (repeatedly, when idle or in pursuit of target.)

Basically, the SCP would be a couch that, when a ""host"" lays on it, it drains their energy. The host can get up and feel normal over time. The couch ""builds up"" this energy and eventually is able to consume the host by absorbing them through the cushions. 

The couch could have been discovered with a partially absorbed person (or just a limb protruding from it) which gained the attention of the foundation.

If you want to do something that is possible for humans you roll 1d6. If your background allows you to be good in this task you roll an additional 1d6. If you want to risk your sanity you roll an additional 1d6.

The heavy bass of the music shook the car and she was giggling and lurching and he was grinning and the car darted through the night. 

They were on an old highway, passing signs and people and lights and not caring, high on feeling and too out of it to think about what those fleeting warnings might mean. 

“Pull over. I’m gonna...” She slumped forward and swallowed. “Pull over.” She groaned a little bit and slapped his shoulder to get him to notice. “Hey.” When the car stopped she kicked open the door and retched in the middle of the lane. 

“You done?” He was getting impatient. 

A few moans and more retching noises were his reply. After a while it stopped and she curled back into her seat. She was crying and unhappy but she giggled at him when he looked over at her. “Okay?” She nodded, licking her lips.  

Her head hit the seat as the car squealed, cried, and groaned forward. But then there were lights behind them. Noises following. Red and blue and and flashing and he was angry. His toes touched the brakes and he signaled over, but the sirens didn’t relent. And then the noise was right behind them and the lights were in their eyes. “The hell?” He was angry, more angry, and punched the vehicle faster. Boom, behind them. The car wobbled. 

She kept crying and held her head as she heaved. And then the radio went silent. And then it changed, the dial spinning on its own, typing its own message: “Run...fu..ckers, fuc..kers, run... run.” He swore under his breath, fear changing his face. She was confused, pulling her hair and sobbing. 

The car was beside them, now, hitting them, screeching at them. “Run, fuckers,” the radio spit again. And the car spun off the roadway. 

The car’s wheels still spun, steaming in the ditch. There was blood now – they’d hit a tree. “Fuckers, fuckers...” softer now. She flailed and punched, pushing away the airbags. And then she saw him in the windshield.

“Hey!” She cried, grabbing his legs, his hands. “Hey!” She cried into the back of his knee, the blood from her forehead soaking into his pant leg. 

And then a scraping noise was at her door. She turned her head slowly, blinking through the tears. “Hello?” She hurt and her heart was beating in her head. “Who’s there?”

“Don’t worry.” The reply. “I’m here to... help. To help.” A man was standing by the door, yanking and scratching at the twisted metal. A cop. “I’m here to help. I’ll help you.” She sat up and tried to help him with the door. It was coming loose. She saw him smile. “I’m helping you.” His tongue snaked out of his mouth, long and curled and black and moving. 
He tore off the door with an arm, one movement, then dropped on her, choking her, his tongue around her neck and on her lips.

SCP-XXX is a cup with no significant physical qualities. Approximately two (2) days after consuming any liquid previously poured into SCP-XXX, the subjects blood will be transformed into the liquid. 

After this point, the subject will reject all food and drink, claiming the liquid it drank will sustain him/her indefinitely. After testing, it is discovered that they in fact do not in fact need any more nourishment, as their blood is eternally feeding them. How it does this is unknown.

However, after approximately one week, subjects display deteriorating intelligence, and often only speak of the sustaining liquid that is keeping them alive. The blood passing through the brain appears to cause this.

After two (2) weeks the subject will begin to act violently towards others, and will not hesitate to injure or kill any personnel that crosses it's path. When questioned why they do this, they say ""it"" has demanded it.

Aaaand done. I've never written an scp page, and am hoping to try sometime. Any thoughts? And yes, i know how i wrote this sucks, and it probably has a bunch of grammatical errors.

EDIT: Blood shows more powerful white blood cells, allowing wounds to heal much more quickly. Destruction of an infected subject proves difficult. Subject does not appear to show signs of pain, and will continue its rampage even after having massive damage done to them. Bones have been shown to produce blood at an increased rate, making death by blood loss impossible.

1361071688.0	18o9oz	I think I actually found the Inspiration for Bobble The Clown.	Skullkan6	14	1	1	"This was just me wondering a bit, but I remember reading a book called [WHEN THE TRIPODS CAME](http://www.amazon.com/When-Tripods-Came-John-Christopher/dp/0689857624) a few years back and until recently I hadn't drawn the connection between ""The Trippy Show"" and Bobble, as I always thought it was inspired by [Candle Cove.](http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/Candle_Cove) Having read the book, the parallels are without a doubt there, and there are quite a few.
While I don't remember if the show itself had immediate anomalous effects, it specifically targeted children to the point where they would become ""addicted"" and eventually brainwashed. In the book you hear about a child in America who stabbed their parents to death for missing a recording. There is also a part where after realizing what the TV signal is (there was a previous attack via the first tripod) humanity did actually try blocking the signal but like with bobble the signal changed every time it was blocked.

If you haven't read it yet, I'd actually suggest it, as even for adults the writing and many of the concepts and execution works rather well."	t5_2r4ni	True

It doesn't take that big a leap of imagination to realize that the ""Thousand"" mentioned in the name is a reference to the SCPs contained by the Foundation, since the traditional numbering system goes from 001 to 999. As far as I can tell, page 917 seems to indicate that as bad as Able can be, he was put into his current state by some forgotten person (possibly a founder of the Hand?) as a containment procedure for something even nastier than he is.

The 'walls of ignorance' also show up in the [Tale of the Brothers](http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/the-tale-of-the-brothers) from the Ophiuchus Codex, along with a reference to a 'poison girl' who seems to be the same entity as the 'first poisoner'.

Only those who were present as it was written will remember the original time line. If someone writes in the book with no one else around, only they will know what the event used to be like.

**Object Class:** Safe/Euclid    
  
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-X are to be contained in a water filled aquarium measuring 4ft x 4ft x 4ft, with thermometers in place to measure any changes in temperature, which should immediately be reported. 4 fire extinguishers capable of extinguishing all grade of flame are lined up on the wall behind the aquarium.  

**Description:** SCP-X are a pair of antique firefighter's boots, severely worn and torn, all identifying marks of make and model have been defaced by work and age, they're made of a heavy leather material with charred markings, and slight melting of the rubber coatings, the boots can be seemingly worn comfortably by anyone, regardless of size of their feet, however the boots are described to have a rather ""loose"" feeling.  
The main anomalous property is the ability to protect the wearer from harm by heat or flame.  
Subjects do not feel any heat from fires, and the fires do not make direct contact with the wearer, they seem to bend around the subject as if it is being re-directed by a field or aura.  
Testing is concluded the Wearer can withstand  10,000*F.  Testing for higher temperatures as well as freezing temperatures are pending approval.  
  
Testing with varying D-Class and Agents have resulted in the discovery of two extra effects when worn by specific kinds of people.  

* D-X-5, serving life sentence for Arson related crimes, when donning the boots, was given an added ability of projecting fire from the subject's body. The associated heat from the blasts resulted in melting through a 3in thick steel wall.  
Repeated usage of this new ability has an extended affect on the user, the energy is drawn from the subject's body, resulting in malnourishment, an emaciated frame, and eventually death.  
Upon death the body is consumed by fire and charred to bone, leaving only the boots undamaged.    

* testing with Agent ####, who had a background as a volunteer firefighter before working for the Foundation, revealed the ability to absorb and have some control over fire and heat, taking a blue-ish hue as it is being manipulated, the absorbed fire and heat can then also be discharged as blue flame projections without the loss of bio-mass or energy from the subject.  

**Acquisition:** A series of fires in rural Kentucky,X/X/XX9X, came to the attention of Foundation staff after patterns in the fires, and burns suggested anomalous artifacts, SCP-X was later obtained from a charred corpse at a scene of another arson. There have been no other anomalous fires in that region to date.

1358239171.0	16lxyn	Resubmitting my idea for SCP-1818	hunterreckoning	19	7	33	"**Item#** - 1818

**Object Class**: Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures** : Subject is to be kept in a 5x6x8 meter cell, furnished with a bed, television, and bookshelf. Subject is not allowed to interact with any personnel, of any rank. If subject is in a situation where his life is threatened, personnel armed with special grade noise canceling headphones, and subject is to be immediately gagged. If subject is found communicating with anyone, subject is to be gagged and moved to a 1.5x1.5x2 meter sound proofed iron cell for protection against instances of SCP-1818b. Subject is not under any circumstances allowed to be given access to computers, pen and paper, recording devices, or telephones.  

**Description** : Subject is a caucasian male, age 17 at time of containment, measuring 1.82 meters in height, with a weight of approximately 95.25kgs. Subject has black hair, and grey eyes. Subject’s only noticeable difference than that of an average human, his a very noticeably grey pigmentation covering his entire body. Subject has an average intelligence, and completely regular brainwaves, until encounter with any humans who are to become an instance of SCP-1818a. 
SCP-1818’s ability has been observed to have a telepathic effect on those he initiates in communication with, altering their thoughts involuntarily. When another human comes into contact, SCP-1818’s pulse increases dramatically for several hours. SCP-1818 becomes very active, and social in this state, wishing to converse for very long periods of time. This amount of time had been measured from a range of One (1) hour to Fifteen (15) hours. Once encounter is over, SCP-1818 goes into a hibernation period, equal to the length of the aforementioned conversation.
Once the conversation is concluded, usually forcibly interrupted, the second subject will be in very high spirits, very noticeably more enjoyable, and optimistic. Effect is also noticeably more effective towards those who are suffering from loneliness, or who are severely depressed.
After anywhere from Twelve (12) to Thirty-Six (36) hours after first exposure, human subject (Here after referred to as SCP-1818a), will attempt to meet with SCP-1818 again, coinciding with SCP-1818’s awakening. If SCP-1818a is denied access to SCP-1818, SCP-1818a has been observed to “appear” wherever SCP-1818 is. Is is not known how this occurs. It has been speculated that it’s a point to point teleportation, while other researchers believe SCP-1818a might slip into another dimension, then reappear at the location.When the second encounter occurs, SCP-1818a will act as though they are good friends. When SCP-1818a is re-introduced, they are to be reclassified as SCP-1818b. 
It has been observed that SCP-1818 has absolutely no recollection of any events 48 hours prior to his awakening from hibernation. Upon learning this fact, SCP-1818b will have the following varied results:

* 39% of instances of SCP-1818b have been known to slip into a deep and severe depression, ultimately claiming their own life

Attempts have been made to administer amnesiacs to SCP-1818a and 1818b, although all attempts have proven ineffective.

SCP-1818, seemingly has no memory of his ability, but following the death of an instance of SCP-1818b, no matter where he is located, has been observed to grow noticeably happier, and very eager to socialize with others.

It is also worth noting, that his abilities work when his voice is recorded, or written, but only if there is a verbal or written response.

1342634250.0	wrqz3	Worked on a new idea for an SCP this morning, thoughts?	contributingfactors	16	4	17	"**SCP-XXXX**

**Object Class:** Elucid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX as of ███████ ██, ████ has been inside of site 45 in a room that is 10 meters by 10 meters. The room’s walls are approximately 5 meters thick and made of titanium steel that is reinforced by 2 meters of concrete on both sides of the metal. The door has a small sliding door meant to slide food into the room for SCP-XXXX, which is to be done once a day. The diet consists of raw beef, chicken and nuts. Water is to be given to SCP-XXXX every hour. 

No verbal interaction is to occur with SCP-XXXX unless you are authorized by Doctor ██████to do so. Two guards are to stand by the doors at all times and switch after every twelve hours. The guards never remain the same and new ones are brought every six months (As of now we are sure that is how long it takes before SCP-XXXX can have an effect on non-verbal prey. To prevent temptation to communicate with SCP-XXXX, the room is sound-proof unless the top small peek-through door is unlocked and slid open. 

Authorized personnel are not to enter the room where SCP-XXXX resides and are to communicate with it through the sliding door at the top that is usually locked and the key is in the hands of Doctor ███████. No copies are to be made of this key, anyone who tries will [DATA REDACTED]. 

While talking to SCP-XXXX, eye contact must remain on your writing and not through the hole. You are only opening the sliding door to be able to make contact with it, not to look. Any and all questions must be approved by Doctor Bright before you are authorized to go through with your work. 

*[NEW] To all personnel that are authorized to speak to SCP-XXXX, you now only have thirty minutes to do what you wish. You may do this once a day until you get what you need but you are only allowed thirty minutes at a time. Any personnel that show signs of SCP-XXXX’s effects will be put into containment until measures are taken to [DATA EXPUNGED]. – Doctor ███████*

*[NEW] Those of you who wonder why your proposals are shot down: You may or may not have already had contact with SCP-XXXX and had your memory wiped for your own safety. You will not be told if this is the case, it may just mean you need to finish your current projects or revise your questions. –Doctor ███████*

**Description:** SCP-XXXX stands about 1.5 meters tall and has the appearance of a brown bear. It walks on two feet and has mannerisms of a human though does not enjoy cooked food. Attempts to see if SCP-XXXX would survive without food ended with it becoming tired, weak and showing signs of malnutrition and dehydration. 

Its right eye is a honey color while the left is blue, SCP-XXXX stated that it is blind through its left eye and wished to have someone help it around the facility, it still continues to ask for this assistance but it will always be denied.

Upon looking at SCP-XXXX, the person will feel guilt as if they have wronged it in some way and must make it up to SCP-XXXX. 

Anything that SCP-XXXX asks of the person will seem like a small favor compared to what they ‘owe’ it. At first it would only ask personnel for a hug and even just for extra servings of food and for honey to be added to its diet. Honey seemed to make it shake and go into a manic state of mind, do not give SCP-XXXX honey.
SCP-XXXX recently has asked personnel to hurt themselves. 

Personnel used any items in their possession to cause harm to them in a deadly manor. SCP-XXXX has asked some personnel to kill the guards so it could get some exercise, the employee was restrained and died three hours after being away from SCP-XXXX from clawing their arms apart and losing far too much blood. They insisted they had to ‘make it up’ to SCP-XXXX and if they did not they did not deserve to live.

It seems to only have effect on those that make eye contact with it, though, those that do not see it and have verbal contact with SCP-XXXX have explained feeling angry at themselves and feeling the temptation to use their writing instrument to harm those around them and to even rip out their own eyes.

Guards who have been near SCP-XXXX without verbal contact and seeing it have refused food and water. Twelve hours after refusing food and water the guards were found dead from malnutrition and dehydration as if they had gone without for months even if they had eaten the day before. (To our knowledge this only happens after seven months.)

*[NEW] SCP-XXXX has been asking for baths lately, it does not need a bath; do not open the door to let it out so it can bathe. I know it sounds inhuman of us to refuse it a bath but it’s for everyone’s own good. –Doctor ███████*

**Addendum:** SCP-XXXX has recently become very demanding and at times reverts back into acting like a bear. This proved to be a show it put on for us to put it into the wild. Do not fall for it and ignore this, after an hour it will go back to acting normally.

After the most recent interview with SCP-XXXX, it appears it is not a bear and ‘allows’ us to see it as that. What its true form looks like is still being looked into.

**Document #XXX-1: Interview 1**

**SCP-XXXX:** Thank you for coming to see me, can you let me out?

**Doctor ███████:** You know I can’t do that for you. 

**SCP-XXXX:** But, why not?

**Doctor ███████:** I—I …I’m sorry. 

**SCP-XXXX:** I know, it’s fine, I forgive you.

**Doctor ███████:** I’m so sorry, why are you in there? That doesn’t seem right.

**SCP-XXXX:** Can I just go out and walk? 

**Doctor ███████:** O-Of course you can! Anything, anything at all!

*[Doctor ███████ proceeded to attempt to open up SCP-XXXX’s door and had to be restrained and tranquilized. Doctor ███████ continued to insist after waking up that they owed it to SCP-XXXX to help it. After 48 hours Doctor ███████ returned to normal and had no recollection of anything after telling SCP-XXXX it could not be let out.]*"	t5_2r4ni	True

After reading through all the attempts to terminate SCP-682, I can't help but wonder if one possible weapon has been overlooked, the output from SCP-914 when ""1 standard Colt Python revolver"" was put through on the ""Very Fine"" setting.

**Edit**: This following is -not- meant to be taken seriously.

SCP-XXXX is a 98 Ford Whatever. For every seventy-eight openings of it's trunk it opens into another car-trunk entirely. 

These anomalous openings are beneficial somehow. 

One was a star witness in a Mafia case that had been poisoned and left to die. The Foundation saved the man, gave him amnesiacs and shoved him out into society because his testimony affected holdings of Marshall Carter and Dark.

Another opening revealed misplaced photo albums from a junked car. These were sentimental items allowing the Foundation to return them and gain positive influence with a govt. official.

The twist is, the car was created by a Group of Interest that wants to SUPPORT the Foundation. 

Of course, the Foundation doesn't want unknown groups creating anamolies willy nilly, no matter how much they benefit the Foundation's operations. This GOI is a bit naive. 

In other words; they are self appointed researchers and agents and despite trying to be good guys, the Foundation has to hunt them down.

It's a whole meta-meta-meta-level Mary Sue twist.

I think the point of the search was to find the center of the SCP, which would of been the area that would of been changed the most. 

Yes I have tried to look for it myself but have been unsuccessful. 

Edit: The picture used for the SCP was of a aerial view of a large compact living complex, building being placed only a few feet away from each other, which was demolished a few years ago.

In short, if text is printed about it, people go nuts and put every resource they have into pointlessly, mindlessly protecting it. This, of course, included showing the receipt to other people in order to 'gain' their help. 

Fortunately audio instructions negates textual instructions. 

TL;DR: How do you secure the football if you can't write about it? 

I can't think of a single scenario that doesn't result in massive security breaches and/or the complete collapse of the Foundation.

###The why
I play a game called [Technoir](http://technoirrpg.com/), which is pretty much what you would get if you mixed [Fiasco](http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/) and [Shadowrun](http://www.shadowrun.com/shadowrun-universe/tabletop-shadowrun) together. Last week my group decided that we were going to try swapping out the cyberpunk elements for SCPs. No problem, easily done with Technoir. Trouble is that now I have to put together what is called a transmission, which is a bunch of elements that are then randomly selected and linked together to form the setup or adventure.

I've modeled the transmission after our city of residence and have already filled in factions, locations, events and people. The only thing I am missing is objects, which obviously need to be SCPs. My problem is that there are so many SCPs that I just don't know which ones to (potentially) throw into the mix.

###What I need help with

I need suggestions for SCPs that I can slot into the transmission. Ideally the SCPs should be things that, when dropped into a city filled with tensions, make a big mess of things. Said mess doesn't necessarily need to be of the deadly variety.

One SCP I have been thinking about using is [SCP-1082](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1082) because I think it would interact in interesting ways with the various city factions and people.

Anybody have some good suggestions?"	t5_2r4ni	True

**Item #:** SCP-1362

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**

Ambulatory instances of SCP-1362-1 are to be terminated on sight. Pregnant women in the 50 km vicinity of the sighting are to be monitored, their children are to be examined for signs of SCP-1362 infection.

If larval instances of SCP-1362-1 are found in hosts younger than 13 years, they should be removed and destroyed. Hosts and physicians who have seen the host's X-ray images should be fed standard cover story 1362-A^1 . If possible, removal should be performed in a Foundation-maintained hospital. If this proves to be impossible, civilian surgeons can be briefed on the details of SCP-1362. These surgeons should be given class-A amnesiacs after the operation and should be fed standard cover story 1362-B^2 .

Larval instances of SCP-1362-1 in hosts older than 13 years are to be killed with radiation therapy on the host. X-ray images should be destroyed, physicians and hosts are to be given class-A amnesiacs and should be fed standard cover story 1362-C^3 . Once this instance of SCP-1362-1 is killed, it should be removed from the host. Participating surgeons are to be fed standard cover story 1362-D^4 .

Male infants killed by SCP-1362-1 should be replaced with a replica made with SCP-604. Class-A amnesiacs should be administered to everyone who knows about the exact circumstances of the child's death, covers story 1362-E^5 is to be used.

Instances of SCP-1362-3 are to be terminated in infancy. They should be prevented from reaching sexual maturity at all costs. MTF Pi-12 (""Population Control"") is tasked with the examination of reports of sexually mature SCP-1362-3 instances. If an instance of SCP-1362-3 has impregnated a woman, the fetus must be aborted and cover story 1362-F^6 must be fed to the participating surgeons. Every pregnant woman who has interacted with the mother should be considered infected and their children are to be operated immediately after birth.

Over 100 instances of SCP-1362-1 in a city in an 1-year period should be considered an outbreak. In this case procedure 243-Solomon should be executed.

Several instances of SCP-1362-1 and SCP-1362-2 are stored in vacuum-sealed cryogenic storage units. Anyone with at least level 2 clearance can request samples for examination from Dr. ████████. 

**Description:**

SCP-1362 is a parasite that reproduces primarily by disguising itself as a fetus-in-fetu and secondarily by taking over the reproductive organs of a male human.

SCP-1362-1 is a bipedal animal measuring 12-27 cm in length. It exists in two states: a parasitic larval state and an ambulatory breeder state. Its general body shape is similar to a human fetus with two large claws in place of its hands. Its exoskeleton is composed of bone, making it appear on X-ray images as a calcified fetus-in-fetu.

SCP-1362-1 enters the host in the host's fetal state and lives as a parasite. In males, it liquifies the internal organs of the host 3-4 weeks after birth and absorbs the nutrients. In females, it maturates slowly until the onset of puberty. After maturation, it starts secreting a toxin that causes extreme promiscuity in the hosts. The hosts will attempt to engage in unprotected coitus with as many men as they can. They don't respond to contraceptives and there are recorded instances of SCP-1362 causing latex allergy. SCP-1362-1 has an average lifespan of 34 years. If the host survives the parasite, SCP-1362-1 dies and its body becomes absorbed. The psychological symptoms disappear in 3 to 9 months.

Upon the expiration of the host, a mature SCP-1362-1 instance will claw its way out from the host's body and start hunting for means of procreation. It has no mouth and its lungs are severely underdeveloped so it can only live for approximately 36 hours after leaving the host. In this time it will seek out pregnant women and inject them with an instance of SCP-1362-2. SCP-1362-2 is a single-cell organism capable of embedding itself in a human embryo in its first trimester. It's generally injected into the woman's bloodstream from an opening at the tip of the claws of SCP-1362-1 but it can enter the bloodstream via the lungs or the stomach as well. After embedding itself in a human embryo, SCP-1362-2 develops into an instance of SCP-1362-1. A single instance of SCP-1362-1 is capable of infecting up to 97 embryos^7 . It will attempt to infect pregnant women in the second or third trimester too, infection in these cases is usually unsuccessful.

If a female host is impregnated, her child will become an instance of SCP-1362-3. SCP-1362-3 is outwardly similar to an ordinary male human. However, it is alway born with chimerism: its testicles are genetically identical to SCP-1362-1. After reaching sexual maturity, SCP-1362-3 instances emit powerful pheromones making them more attractive to females. They also have an increased libido and a strong aversion to contraceptives. Castration, gelding or vasectomy preformed on instances of SCP-1362-3 is ineffective as these body parts always regenerate. Women impregnated by an instance of SCP-1362-3 will develop symptoms similar to a common cold. Instead of rhinovirus, however, they will spread instances of SCP-1362-2. The embryo itself is another instance of SCP-1362-3. Because of the high infectivity and the effect SCP-1362-1 has on humans, SCP-1362-3 instances have to be terminated before reaching sexual maturity.

**History**:

SCP-1362 got the Foundation's attention after the deaths of 17 male infants in the village of █████████, Mexico in 19██. The relative isolation of the village prevented a global outbreak. After the Foundation's agents arrived, they heard rumors of a ""niño furioso"" (lit. ""angry child""), the angry spirit of the dead child appearing in the village after the death of every infant. Examination of the village lead to the agents encountering the carcasses of several SCP-1362-1 instances. This prompted the Foundation to send a complete medical contingent to the village.

The contingent examined the surviving male infants and determined that they were all instances of SCP-1362-3. The village was immediately quarantined, SCP-1362-1 instances were removed from the females of the village, SCP-1362-3 instances were taken into Foundation custody, amnesiacs were administered and a cover story was created about a viral infection.

After extensive examinations (resulting in the death of 3 of the 5 detained SCP-1362-3 instances), the Foundation decided that since SCP-1362-3 instances can't be neutralized and lifelong imprisonment would be too draining for the Foundation, their termination in infancy or their abortion is the more humane solution.

2: leaking anaesthetic gas after the successful removal of the parasitic twin

What i mean, does it actually have underlying *evil* intentions, cloaked underneath a facade of  company that seeks to protect the world from various evils, albeit often coldly, in an uncaring and cruel manner.

There have been several hints. Like in the **Addendum 231-b** of SCP-231, underneath a text warning Agents that, even though what they do to SCP-231 is horrifying, they must not try to save her or help her in any way. Underneath and explanation for the Foundations motives, there's this:

&gt;Don't believe it when they say they're trying to save her. Why would they bother? They've got exactly what they want exactly where they want it.

I know this might be a stupid question, but it would make an interesting conversation.

Personally, i preffer if The Foundation remained in a moral gray area. It's more interesting than a simple ""we're the bad guys actually"", though that too can be executed with brilliance.

**Item #:** SCP-1971

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1971 is not to be handled by personnel, unless it is being used for an experiment. D-Class personnel who handle SCP-1971 are to place it in a 10cm x 14cm x 5cm steel case, lined with velvet, before the end of the experiment. In the event that the subject is terminated before SCP-1971 is returned to its case, only D-Class personnel may be sent in to retrieve it. 

**Description:** SCP-1971 is a silver WESTCLOX Scotty pocket watch. The object has no dents or scratches on its face. The numbers glow when they are exposed to light. SCP-1971 must be wound manually for it to function properly.

The interesting thing about SCP-1971 is its affect on humans. If any person comes into contact with SCP-1971, and activates it, the amount of time left on the clock is haw long the person has left to live. If SCP-1971 stops, then the subject (Now to be referred to as SCP-1971a) will cease living. Autopsies have indicated that [DATA EXPUNGED] Should SCP-1971a wind SCP-1971 before it stops; SCP-1971a will continue to live.    

**Addendum:** Re-Classification of SCP-1971 requested to upgrade to Keter level. D-Class subjects have stated that, upon approaching SCP-1971 they are compelled to touch it. One D-Class who had been in possession of SCP-1971 for 82 hours stated that “It keeps telling me to put it down and forget about it. Why would it do that?” The subject was observed later setting SCP-1971 in its containment case, and walking away from it in a trance like state. Subject ceased living 10 hours later, when SCP-1971 wound down.

**Story**
The story is still under heavy development, so all I will reveal for now is that it will include details on the Chaos Insurgency and the SCP Foundation's battles over certain SCPs.

**Gameplay**
The game will be set up as a first-person game, where you can pickup weapons such as machine guns to use on your enemies or you can explore the SCP Foundation's many sites. The SCPs function as ""bosses""(usually) while groups such as the Chaos Insurgency's and The Church of the Broken God's agents serve as the regular opponents. Occasionally, SCPs will breach their containment and you will have to re-contain them. I also plan to add RPG elements, although I am not sure what they will be. I am thinking of a system similar to the one in Bioshock, where researching SCPs will help you fight against them, contain them, and create better equipment.

Those are the main features I plan on implementing if this idea becomes popular. I also plan on working with the community to create the most accurate representation of the locations, people, and organizations used in this game. If I really begin working on this, I plan on using Cryengine 3 to create the game.

Hope you guys like the idea!

Also, on the idea that 173 cannot even more his arms, being made of concrete... The original 173 image already shows us that he can move his head, likely in addition to other parts of his body.

1362833267.0	19yvlw	An SCP idea	gerusz	9	2	7	"So, this is just a rough idea for an SCP:

**Item #: SCP-XXX**

**Object class: Euclid**

**Special Containment Procedures:** Source codes for SCP-XXX-P instances that are deemed worthy of further analysis and binaries of SCP-XXX-C instances are to be kept on Secure Foundation Server XXX at Site-18. A database of SCP-XXX-L features discovered so far is to be kept on the Foundation intranet. Access to the database and SFS XXX might be provided for individuals with an experience in programming under the supervision of Dr. ██████. SCP-XXX-P instances might only be run on devices without any network connectivity or, if connectivity is required by them, a small network simulating the internet using SCP-335 if necessary.

Due to its effects on computers and other programs running on the computer, cross-testing of SCP-XXX and computer-based SCPs has to be authorized by O5.

SCP-XXX-P and SCP-XXX-C instances in the wild should be secured, if possible with their source codes, then deleted. The programmers who have used SCP-XXX-L are to be detained and interviewed (especially focusing on their knowledge of SCP-XXX-L's creator). They can be released after administration of Class-A amnesiac or, if they show great talent in using SCP-XXX-L, a position with L1/XXX clearance could be offered to them in Dr. ██████'s research team under the guise of employment at the Silicium Consultant Programming corporation.

SCP-XXX-L's creator (who, based on the comments in SCP-XXX-L's header file, uses the alias DoctorSoul19) should be apprehended and interviewed if possible. Foundation personnel embedded into internet service providers and intelligence agencies should monitor internet traffic for any references to SCP-XXX-L and DoctorSoul19.

**Description:** SCP-XXX is an anomalous library to the C++ programming language. SCP-XXX-L is the designation of the library itself (called EmC), SCP-XXX-C is the collective designation of the compilers for several devices (including microcontrollers, mobile phones and personal computers) capable of compiling SCP-XXX-L correctly (other C++ compilers simply translate SCP-XXX-L instructions into NOOP commands, programs compiled this way don't show any anomalous properties) and SCP-XXX-P is the collective designations for programs written using SCP-XXX-L. When a C++ program is compiled with SCP-XXX-C without including SCP-XXX-L's header file it shows no anomalous properties. These properties only manifest if SCP-XXX-L's header is included and the compiled binaries of SCP-XXX-L (EmC.dll or EmC.so) can be found on the system.

Functions found in SCP-XXX-L are used to access and alter the emotional state of the computer running the program. As SCP-XXX-L lacks a proper documentation, the complete set of possible emotional states is unknown. Using the source code of recovered SCP-XXX-P instances and trial-and-error method, the Foundation has assembled a partial database of the emotional states and their effects on the computer (see attachment SCP-XXX-A1). Note, that the majority of the emotional states can't be set directly and a direct change in emotional state issued by invoking the setMood() function can be refused throwing an exception (especially if said change would constitute an extreme mood swing).

It is also discovered that not every computer is capable of using the full range of discovered emotions. As a rule of thumb, the more sophisticated the computer, the more sophisticated the available emotions are: microcontrollers are only capable of using the most basic emotions (""scared"", ""angry"", ""sad"", ""happy"", ""excited"", ""neutral""), whereas the most sophisticated example of SCP-XXX-P encountered (SCP-XXX-P1267, written for a 16384-core supercomputer cluster) contained references to emotions like ""heartbroken"", ""inspired"" or ""zestful"".

During experimentation, it was discovered that the emotional state of a computer running SCP-XXX-P is influenced by other programs running on the computer and that this emotional state will affect all programs running on the computer. Terminating the SCP-XXX-P instance doesn't stop this effect, only rebooting the computer does.

Extract from Addendum SCP-XXX-A1:

|Designation | Can be set directly?^1 | Minimal complexity required | Effect |
|:------|:------|:------|:------|
|Neutral|Yes|Any CPU|Computers in neutral mood perform as expected, but their emotional state is subject to change.
|Happy|Yes|8-bit CPU|Calculations are performed faster (with a factor of 2-3), but a small error is present. In integer calculations, this error usually means +/-1 in 3.2% of the calculations and a larger error in 0.5%. Testing with floating point calculations showed that this error has a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0.5.
|Sad|Yes|8-bit CPU|Calculations are performed slower (with a factor of 2-3). If it persists and the computer is complex enough, it might transform into ""depressed"".
|Angry|No|8-bit CPU|Calculations are performed faster, but with a large error (σ=2). The computer may refuse to perform time-consuming calculations.
|Excited|No|8-bit CPU|Usually a result of the program approaching the end of a cycle with a large number (&gt;10^5 ) of iterations. Calculations are performed faster and accurately. If the next instructions are sufficiently different from the ones in the cycle, the computer will probably enter into a ""happy"" mood. If they are similar, it will enter into a ""sad"" mood. If they are only slightly different, it will enter into a ""neutral"" mode.
|Scared|No|8-bit CPU|Usually a result of unexpected input or slight hardware issues (fluctuation in the power supply, for example). The computer will slow down considerably and might make small errors in the calculations (σ=1). Its speed will gradually resume to normal and the error will approach σ=0 in the next 2^32 cycles. After this, the mood will return to neutral (or, if the computer is complex enough, ""relieved"")
|Annoyed|No|16-bit CPU|Usually a result of frequent interrupts. The computer might start to ignore some of these interrupts. If interrupts continue, it might enter into an ""angry"" state.
|Lonely|No|16-bit CPU|Results if an SCP-XXX-P is the only program running on a computer without user input. Identical to ""neutral"", but the computer will enter into a  ""sad"" mood if it persists.
|Proud|No|32-bit CPU|Results if the computer output a large amount of information. The next few operations will be performed faster, without errors.
|Guilty|No|32-bit CPU|Results if the program has caused inconvenience or errors to other programs (timeouts, etc...) or the user, especially if it was because of its emotional state (""angry"" or ""scared"" states are prone to cause this state). Effects identical to ""sad"", but the computer will enter into ""neutral"" mode after 2^64 cycles.
|Depressed|No|32-bit CPU|A computer usually enters into a ""depressed"" state if a ""sad"" state persists for more than 2^32 cycles. In this state its speed slows down even more than in the ""sad"" mood (with a factor of 8-10) and an error with σ=1 is introduced. The computer might refuse to perform some operations.
|Flow|No|64-bit CPU, at least 2 cores, at least 2 GB of RAM per core, SSD or similarly fast storage medium|It's unknown what causes ""flow"" state, but it usually occurs when the computer performs similar memory and CPU-consuming (&gt;75% of average load) tasks in a row and it's in a neutral or happy mood. The processing speed of tasks similar to what caused the flow shows a significant (a factor of 64-128) increase. It's unknown where the resulting processing power comes from as the heat output of the CPU doesn't show an increase consistent with overclocking. After a ""flow"", the computer will inevitably enter into a ""proud"" state.
|Suicidal|No|64-bit CPU, at least 2 cores|The computer will refuse to perform most operations. If this state persists for long, the computer will cause irreparable hardware damage to itself and shut down. It's recommended to reboot a computer once it enters into suicidal mode - while it can be moved out from it, it usually takes time.
|Inspired|No|Unknown, observed in a program running on a 16384-core supercomputer|Similar to ""flow"", but the computer will use its extra computing power to generate other outputs not included in the program. These outputs are usually relevant to the user.
|Zestful|No|Unknown, observed in a program running on a 16384-core supercomputer|If a computer is in a ""zestful"" mood, a sufficiently complex calculation will process faster (and there's a chance that the computer will enter into an ""inspired"" or ""flow"" mood). However, if the computer performs simple calculations in a ""zestful"" mood, it might transition into ""bored"".
|Heartbroken|No|Unknown, observed in a program running on a 16384-core supercomputer|Unknown, during observation the ""heartbroken"" state wasn't achieved. However, the source code of SCP-XXX-P1267 calls for excessive interaction with other programs, computers and users in case of the ""heartbroken"" state. Note: it implies that there's an ""in love"", or at least an ""infatuated"" state, but no reference to these has been found.

^1 : even if an emotional state can be set directly, it might not always succeed - sudden mood swings are not allowed and directly changing emotional state from some emotional states - like depressed or suicidal - is explicitly disallowed.

 ownership."	Wrenchguy	9	1	7	"Hey Fellow agents, 

Like you guys, I've been obsessed over the wealth of lore The SCP Foundation provides. One SCP, [SCP-507](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-507) has recently caught my eye.

The fact that he is able to freely roam the facility and possibly have a certain rapport with staff (even fellow SCPs: [""Captain Jack""](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-492) comes to mind) along with his unique situation, seems as though it would make for a very interesting concept for a graphic novel. 

My question is, although I'm aware that the Foundation does promote adapting content from the website for fan purposes, I would like to get in contact with the person responsible for the article (among other SCP articles) to formally ask permission along with possibly discussing their thoughts on the character not expressed in their article.

I do plan to do this for many SCPs and hope to create a comic about the whole Foundation, but with [SCP-507](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-507) as the main protagonist.

When walking into a mirror, they enter an alternate world which is identical to our except that, to them, everything is reversed physically, making most food inedible, and the only light is put off from reflective objects (basically, they can only see things visible in reflections). When the holder either dies, or drops the prism with enough force that it would break, it returns to its box, potentially leaving the user stranded in the mirror world, or stuck in another form.

My other idea was an anomalous creature or humanoid. It would, when viewed directly, appear to be a female human toddler of about two or three years old, with some abnormal behaviour and no language capabilities whatsoever. However, when viewed from any recording device (camera, video, even fingerprinting) all signs show up as the being actually being an adult velociraptor. The question is, is it a child with the ability to alter the data, or an animal with the ability to alter human perception? There would be a number of details (diet, size, weight) which would make it ambiguous.

Based on [this](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/document-09-e-3417845/vitamin%20lead.jpg)

SCP-XXX: The Pharmacy 

Classification: Safe (Promotion to Euclid pending O5 approval)

Containment Procedures: SCP-XXX is to be guarded by at least two Agents at all times, and an elecrtic fence is to be kept activated around the premesis, under the guise of a dangerous structural flaw that poses a danger to those who come near it. No one is to enter the building except for authorized tests. All instances of SCP-XXX-2 are to be stored in standard Foundation storage lockers, and accessible to any researcher with prior approval for testing.

Description: SCP-XXX is a small convenience store and pharmacy located at ████████, █████. The exterior is badly damaged and worn down, and suffers a structural collapse at one corner. However, parts of the neon ""PHARMACY"" sign that remain indicate the building was built in the 1960s. 

SCP-XXX possesses several anomalous properties:

Firstly, the interior of the building is completely repaired, and in pristine condition. This was thought to be a simple visual illusion, but after investigation into the corner in which the outside collapsed, it was determined that the interior of SCP-XXX may exist in another bubble-universe. This property is only experienced when entering SCP-XXX through the front door. The interior remains broken and abandoned when entering through one of the many flaws and structural breaks on the exterior.

Secondly, every product in the store appears to be made of human body parts. Bags marked ""POTATO CHIPS"" contain flakes of human flesh, strung nerve endings are packaged as ""LICORICE"" and so forth. All attempts to identify the DNA of the parts have failed.

The most prevalent anomaly is in the pharmacy section. A Caucasian male (hereby reffered to as SCP-XXX-1) stands behind the desk. The man has a happy demeanor, and ""loves his job."" Any damage inflicted to SCP-XXX-1 will not affect his ability to function, and retains his happy personality even through intense torture.

Upon request for a medication or perscription, SCP-XXX-1 will comply, retreating into a room full of pill cases. Every attempt at entering this room as failed, with the room being abandoned and in disrepair upon entry. SCP-XXX-1 will then approach the desk and sell the product (refferred to as SCP-XXX-2). 

SCP-XXX-1 has been able to successfully retreive any medication requested so far. He is also able to produce non-medical substances, such as human blood, and objects, like bullets. SCP-XXX-1 cannot produce any substance that cannot fit in a pill bottle. 

[Here I plan on making a test log. Pretty ""normal"" stuff, like asking for specific people's bodily fluids. Someone asks for something that can kill SCP-682, and SCP-XXX-1 says calmy, ""God have mercy on your souls"", and retreats into his pill room. Upon exiting, he appears to have no memory of the previous events. I also plan on having an interview log with SCP-XXX-1.]

Some other ideas I've had:

[This](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/document-19-v-1911854/strux.jpg). It's a spacial anomaly: From outside looking in, the structure seems to go on forever on the other side. Once entered, the enviroment seems to go on forever on all sides. From the outside, subjects vanish once they're out of sight, even for a moment. Subjects are obviously never found, but recording devices and livestreaming cameras function properly. Subjects report seeing shadowy figures hunting them.

Haven't found an appropriate picture, but just thought of one where there's a large chamber and a smaller chamber beside it. When a living creature is placed in the large chamber and an object placed in the smaller one, the machine will integrate the object into the living thing. i.e, a D-class with a telephone surgically implanted in his skull, or a porcupine with knife quills. All objects can function properly.

So, please let me know what you think!

The Tattoo Brush
The Tattoo Brush was found in a tattoo parlor in [whatever], [whatever]. Any tattoos drawn by this brush will be referred to as SCP-xxxx-1. All variants of SCP-xxxx-1 perform the actions that the real-life counterpart of the picture would perform. For example, a rabbit would hop around. These actions cause slight discomfort and/or pain in the area where SCP-xxxx-1 is. They have been found to cause no external modifications. However, if a lethal object is drawn, i.e. a gun, the gun would, upon firing, cause the subject to feel immediate pain, or death.

On the first day, I was different. Not like I was intended to be. I prowled on four legs, searching for what I could find. I was nothing. Then I met Mother. At the end of the first day, I saw her, rising into the sky over the treetops of her misty valley, turning great rotations in the air, the massive spiral of life itself. I was afraid of her at first. I do not know why.
It was then that I first met one of US THEM no us THEM THEY KILLED US the purge I WILL SERVE they were like me, or, rather, not like me. Like us. They had my spotted pelt and slitted eyes, but they walked on two legs like the Great Ones. At first I did not want to serve Mother, and I tried to escape MOTHER no MOTHER not not MOTHER I WILL NOT but they dragged me back to Mother. And she made me right.

On the second day, I met mother for the first time. I walked on two legs, now, and my face was as flat as a Great One's. I first saw Mother with all those she had newly made right GREAT ONES NO MoTHeR no in her chamber at the top of herself. The room was massive, towering high over our heads. Mother sat at one corner, writing a manuscript, the thousands of parts of her body all pulsing in tandem, forming the words. She taught us to write, to form words of our own. She told us to keep journals written so as to learn as we grow. And so we did.

On the third day, I went on a hunt for the first time. Mother sent several others with spotted pelts and me to go and find any of Them that we could. Out in the woods surrounding Mother, there were many of Them. Mostly the small ones, that flew. We made all of them right.
	I met one of us that I liked. Her name was Athena. We spoke about hunting, and Mother's love.

On the fourth day, I rested, and learned more of Mother's mission. She told us we were instrumental in what she did to help cleanse the world for The Great Ones. We were on the forefront, she said. Hunting Them and making Them into us. Making Them rightINSTINCT for the Great Ones.
I went down into the world, in Mother's lower reaches, because nothing stopped me and I was unengaged. I saw how Mother made the small ones that fly right. They were carried into the room on a conveyor belt, where Mother's many hands molded their bodies into the proper shape: tall and thin, and with no wings. They went through a series of half-circles, which encased their body in a second skeleton made of metal and tore off their beaks, giving them instead mouths like the Great Ones.
After this, I returned to my place of rest. I realized I do not like to walk on two feet. Even with my metal skeleton to support me, I have trouble standing upright. But my skeleton no longer allows for my old ways, so I must make do.

On the fifth day, I went hunting for the small ones that fly with Athena and some others like me. Athena told me they were called birds. MOtHER GREAT ONES the purge the cleanse NO

On the sixth day, I found where metal came from: Instead of hunting, I was sent down below the World, in Mother's very deepest reaches to chip at rocks. Metal crisscrossed the walls down there, in what Mother called veins. When the day's work was done, we'd chipped away many silver-lined stones.
After I'd finished in the mines, I decided to explore Mother more. I watched the birds be made right, and I found a new room, called the Library. Mother said it was full of works she'd penned, so we would see what kind of world we'd make for the Great Ones if we stayed the course on our mission. We were free to take any of the manuscripts to our place of rest to read at our own pace. My favorite is titled The Entropy of Nature. It is about a young man named Thomas who faces adversity but overcomes it. I like it because I can almost imagine myself as Thomas. I read until it was the seventh day.

On the seventh day, I encountered a new kind of challenge: We were no longer hunting birds. The time had come for us to hunt an animal called a leopard. What I used to be, when I walked on four legs. I told Athena this excited me.
""It excites me, too,"" she said. ""I can serve Mother in a greater capacity, now.""
I am becoming more comfortable walking on two legs.
We didn't find any leopards today. Athena was disappointed.

On the eighth day, I was meant to rest, but I explored the library again. The word ""library"" evoked, in my mind, a small, cozy place with books stacked on shelves to the ceiling and a crackling fire burning in a fireplace. Mother's library was the second-largest room inside her. The shelves were stacked to the ceiling, maybe a thousand miles into the air, rising into the darkness out of my field of vision.
I climbed the ladders and catwalks to the highest of shelves, looking for interesting material to read. Mother's works were all sheaves of paper tied together with string. Some are poetry, some are epic stories of great crusades, some are simple outlines of Mother's design schematics.
At the very highest shelf, I found something that piqued my interest: A small collection of literary works, bound into volumes. They were credited to different authors than Mother. I took one named The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkein, and brought it to my place of rest to read.
At first, I didn't like it. I couldn't think of myself like I was Frodo Baggins or Strider, not the way I thought of myself as Thomas. I've decided to keep reading, however, as the plot of the story intrigues me.

Mother read my journal, and she told me to stop counting off days. That I should just write as comes naturally, not tie myself down to numbers. I will now stop counting off days.
Mother also told me she was glad I was reading The Fellowship of the Ring, and she hoped I would learn a lesson from the heroes of the book. She said I could be just like Strider, but only if I made it so. She also said it would help if I thought of her as Gandalf.
I went hunting again with Athena and our group, and we caught a leopard. The leader of our group sent Athena and I around behind the animal while he distracted it. Athena and I jumped it from behind and she broke its neck. In celebration, she hugged me. It felt good. I asked her why she was so happy.
She said she was pleased to serve Mother in such a fashion. I told her to think of what she did, she was the one who took the leopard down. It was her who made a new soldier for us, a new member of the Fellowship. She asked me what I meant by Fellowship. I promised to give her The Fellowship of the Ring when I had finished.
When we returned to Mother, I stayed to watch her make the birds right again. One bird wasn't dead yet. It twitched as it rode with the others on the conveyor belt, opening and closing its beak in a vain effort to cry out. It writhed in pain and blood gushed from its mouth as Mother molded its body into the right shape. As its new skeleton was put on, it looked at me. As its beak was pulled off, it looked at me. As blood gushed out of its mouth, it looked at me. I returned to my place of rest and finished The Fellowship of the Ring.

On the tenth day, I hunted leopards with Athena again. We got three. Athena was ecstatic, for both Mother and herself. An improvement, I suppose. I gave her The Fellowship of the Ring. She said she'd enjoy it, but she had a hard time relating to anyone in it. I told her to think of Mother as Saruman, commanding an unnatural army from her tower of Orthanc.

I have an SCP-idea. This is only a very rough draft, I might expand it to an actual article if there is an interest.

**Class:** Safe

**Containment measures:** heavily guarded safe item locker, disconnected from any power source. Due to its extreme destructive effect, all access must be authorized by the site director. Testing only in a special blast-proof chamber containing a &lt;0.1 mPa vacuum and a blast door that can separate the SCP from the object it's tested on. Testing the SCP on the Tranquility Base must be authorized by O5. During terrestrial testing, no more than 3 moles of matter might be converted. During lunar testing, no more than 100 moles might be converted, though it's practically self-limiting.

**Description:** ""Ray cannon"" confiscated from Prometheus Labs. 1.5 m in length, 125 kg in weight. ""Barrel"" lined with superconducting magnets made of YBCO coils, it must be cooled to 77K or below to function. Operates similarly to a free electron laser, though the anomalous particle source inside emits unknown particles instead of electrons (apparently with an electric charge, or the superconductive magnets would have no effect). The superconducting magnets might be replaced without affecting the functionality.

The particle source appears to be a coil possessing a fractal geometry, made of high-temperature superconductors and several unidentified materials. When powered, it generates an anomalous spacetime bubble around itself that makes direct observation impossible. It weighs 27.35 kg, thus it can be transported with SCP-120 if necessary.

When fired, the ""gun"" emits a wave similar to an electromagnetic wave. However, its energy is shifting between four phases instead of the two phases (electric field and magnetic field) of the standard electromagnetic waves, causing it to ""skip"" half of the distance. Due to its effects, these phases are theorized to be the dark energy equivalent of electric and magnetic fields.

Protons and electrons touched by this beam are converted into a matter that's apparently between normal and dark matter. This conversion seems to be taking away energy from the beam and only occurs at points where the energy of the ""dark electric"" and ""dark magnetic"" fields are nearly equal and their sum is above a certain threshold, thus increasing the frequency of the beam increases the number of conversions but decreases the penetration of the beam.

The converted particles can interact both with normal matter / energy and dark matter / energy. Due to 95.1% of the total mass-energy of the universe being dark matter / energy, objects containing a high concentration of converted particles will superheat themselves and explode violently. Objects containing a low concentration will become radioactive instead as the converted electrons will become superexcited constantly and start emitting gamma-photons and the converted protons destabilizing the nucleon they are bound in, causing it to throw off the neutrons that will be bonded with other nuclei."	t5_2r4ni	True

1363392914.0	1ads9x	My idea for an SCP... thoughts?	fullmetalraz	9	0	12	"**Item #:** SCP-XXXX 
**Object class:** Euclid
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX is to be contained in an airtight steel container, no point of entry is to be designated and must remain sealed until further notice.

**Description:** SCP-XXXX is a medium sized spiraling statue made from stone, it appears to be man made but its origins are unknown. Upon initial observation SCP-XXXX appears to have no anamolous qualities, however upon entering its 'area of effect' strange anomalies occur. When in range of SCP-XXXX all sound is nullified, any attempts to make sound will be ineffective. This field ranges from the base of the object to the walls of whatever room it is in. If placed outside the effect is limited to up to 10 feet. When exposed to SCP-XXXX for even a short amount of time, subjects enter an almost catatonic state. Subjects will refuse to talk, eat, sleep or drink and will do nothing but create replicas of SCP-XXXX from whatever material is available.  
  
So far any attempt to snap an affected person out of this state has proven futile, unless hooked up to IV the subject will die from starvation naturally. When a recording device is used within range of SCP-XXXX, disturbing audio is heard upon playback. Sounds include garbled speech, loud static and phrases repeated like a mantra including ""CREATE"" and ""MARK OUR MEMORY"". Initial recovery began when reports of a young man being hospitilised in [DATA EXPUNGED] after refusing to eat or sleep, choosing instead to make hundreds of copies of SCP-XXXX.  
  
Upon investigation of the local area, the strange spiral pattern was prevelant everywhere but at the time was not noteworthy. Upon discovering an abandoned factory in [REDACTED], SCP-XXXX was located deep in the basement in an exclosed room. Agent [REDACTED] reported a feeling of anxiety upon approaching the room, once the effects of SCP-XXXX were apparent it was removed from the site immediately. The agents involved in recovery all entered the catatonic state associated with SCP-XXXX and have since died from its symptoms. All replicas of SCP-XXXX are to be terminated immediately.


This is the image I had in mind, with some photoshop it may look creepier: http://www.waterfeaturesdirect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Spiral-Statue.jpg


I know I probably made a lot of grammatical mistakes and may have broken a few lore rules regarding how recovery is performed of these objects, but I think this may be a unique enough idea.

[Terminal effects of SCP ####-2](http://www.jessicaharrison.co.uk/USERIMAGES/Jharrison_Skull3.jpg)

**Object Number:** SCP ####
 
**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures**: SCP #### is contained within a Foundation-certified viral containment vault measuring 1.5 cubic meters. Any personnel seeking to interact with the object is to be outfitted in a hazardous materials suit as well as arm-length Kevlar animal-handling gloves rated to resist 2,000 psi in bite force. Subjects infected with SCP ####-2 are to be kept in quarantine in Ward 3-K. Termination and testing of infected subjects is to be carried out at the presiding doctor’s discretion.

**Description:** SCP #### appears as a normal dental phantom used for practice by students of dentistry. While it appears to be inanimate, the object will lunge and attempt to bite any living tissue within ~ 0.5 meters. Testing on SCP #### both in motion and dormant to determine its means of locomotion have been inconclusive. 

The inherent danger of SCP #### stems from the unique viral agent found on the object’s teeth, classified as SCP ####-2. The full progression of the disease can be found in Case Log #### below. At this time, no other sources of SCP ####-2 have been encountered. 

**Case Log ####:**

Date: [|||]/[|||]/[||||]
Personnel: Dr. [|||||||||], Dr. [||||||||||], Dr. [||||||||||], and Dr. [|||||||||||] 

This trial used a total of [|||||||] healthy D-Class and personnel to gain information about the properties of SCP ####-2. 

**Group A:** Population: [|||||||] Procedure: Exposed to a bite from SCP #### and quarantined. 

**Group B:** Population: [|||||||] Procedure: Exposed to a bite from SCP #### and quarantined. Researchers delivered a daily 1ml dose of [|||||||] to suppress subjects’ immune systems. 

**Group C:** Population: [|||||||] Procedure: Given an injection of saline and quarantined with the other patients.

**24 Hours after exposure:**

A /B: Report discomfort in their mouths; teeth have begun to turn gray in color.

C: Nothing to report

**40 Hours after exposure:**

A/B: Teeth visibly rotting, Patients report tinnitus they describe as a “drilling” noise. 

C: Patients practice more regular dental hygiene; Report hearing a drilling noise. Blood test negative for SCP ####-2

Note: Review of audio surveillance returns no “drilling” noise. Researchers labeled the appearance of the sound in C as psychosomatic.

**60 Hours after exposure:**

A/B:  Patients’ teeth have either fallen out or rooted away. Report or intense cranial pressure. Oral examinations and X-Rays show the formation of highly dense bone material in the upper and lower jaw. 

C: Patient’s teeth decaying at a higher than average rate. Blood test negative for SCP ####-2

**80 Hours after exposure:**

A: All patients have developed impressive new sets of teeth. Individual teeth prove hard to extract, take an average of 10 times as long to dissolve in most acids, and maintain a 7 on Moh’s hardness scale. 

B: As Group A. Patients describe unpleasant pressure across their entire body and severe headaches.

C: Minor tooth decay. Blood test negative for SCP ####-2

**85 Hours after exposure:** 

A: Healthy besides tooth development.

B: [|||||||||||] total loss in population. Autopsies reveal cause of death in 90% of patients due to internal hemoraging caused by tooth-like growths developing across bones. The remaining 10% were caused by fatal pressure to the brain caused by the same tooth-like growths occurring on the inside of the skull. 

C: No report. Blood test negative for SCP####-2

**87 Hours after exposure:**

A: Relocated to Site [||||||] for further testing and surveillance. 

B: Entire population deceased. Primary cause of death: Internal and external hemorrhage caused by tooth-like growths rupturing muscle and skin. 

C: Blood test negative for SCP ####-2. Population administered class b amnesiacs and assigned to other projects. 

**Conclusion:**

 SCP ####-2 proves a serious threat to those with weak immune systems. Further testing on group A reveals that the virus has not left the blood stream and remains in dense packets within the mouth. Effect of bites from group A have been shown to be identical to those from SCP ####. The researchers on this project recommend cessation of all future testing on this object.

SCP #### was discovered in [||||||||||], Pennsylvania at [||||||||||] Center of Pediatric Dentistry on [||||||||||] / [||||||||||] / 1996 when imbedded agents at the Center for Disease Control received reports of an anomalous outbreak. The source was discovered by Agent [|||||], who suffered a bite during acquirement. The object was moved to containment at Site 19. Infected subjects were terminated. Subjects in the surrounding area was administered a Class B amnesiac after passing a blood test for SCP ####-2.

The Case Log would be collapsable. Do you think it's too wordy? Any other gripes? Thanks for tuning in!

You're given the ""assignment"" and as you travel through the rubble and (Very spooky) deserted buildings, your electrical communications equipment cuts out due to radioactive interference, which starts out as white noise but slowly forms sounds and what starts to sound like a creature. Different events that occur (Collecting items, breaking doors windows etc) that are necessary for progressing in the game will increase the spooky atmospherics and likelyhood of scp-1145 appearing.Upon seeing scp-1145, the player has limited time to escape before it becomes ""active"" and proceedes to hunt you (emmiting gamma radiation and destroying things it passes through).
