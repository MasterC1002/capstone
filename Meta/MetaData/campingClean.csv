1355901040.0	153jxp	A little safety and first aid suggestion that I'd like to share after learning the hard way last night: When camping/hiking/bushwalking to remote locations with others, please consider (and discuss, if you can) mental health issues with your group.	kilcunda	139	21	18	"The title may seem a little confusing, so here's some context (If you're in a rush and want to skip the wall of text, scroll down to the break or the TL;DR):

For Christmas, myself and three other friends had planned a short overnight hiking trip in the Dandenong Ranges in Australia: Nothing too complicated, a 9 kilometre trek up an old timer tramline then an easy downhill walk the next morning. Unfortunately, two of my friends had to drop out at the last minute, leaving only myself and one other. We had not been camping together before, but knew each other fairly well (friends for about 12 months), so we were completely comfortable going as just the two of us. For convenience of writing and anonymity, I'll call her B.

The walk itself went quite well (save for a tiger-snake that I nearly stepped on), we set up camp and enjoyed sitting around a fire-pit eating dinner and sharing stories. Later that night, however, B woke me up asking if she could come in to my tent for a second. I was a bit confused, but thought that perhaps she couldn't sleep. When I unzipped the entrance, I could see that B was shaking and seemed incredibly nervous. Thinking that something had happened or that she was suffering from hypothermia, I asked if everything was alright. Unexpectedly, she broke down crying and told me that the trees squeaking in the wind was scaring her, which seemed incredibly out of character considering that the encounter with the tiger snake earlier that day barely phased her. Since I had only just been woken, I wasn't quite sure what was going on at first, so I tried my best to comfort her and ask what was wrong. Within less than two minutes she started throwing up. 

Now, I'm no psychologist by any stretch of the imagination, but luckily I've had some experience with people suffering from mental health issues through both my course and a (now ex) partner that was diagnosed with schizophrenia during our relationship. Once I was awake enough to understand what was going on, I realised she was having a panic attack. I tried my best to comfort her and threw some dead ferns on the smouldering fire-pit (I assumed that panic attacks wouldn't mix well with not being able to see anything). Eventually, she was calm enough to speak explain to me that she had been in a car accident about two years earlier where the driver of the other vehicle was killed and that she was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result. She was still shaking and occasionally vomiting, so I made sure she sat next to the fire and kept her fluids up. 

Luckily for us, our campsite bordered a logging track and offered limited 3G coverage in the upper section. We quickly got in contact with her parents who owned a four-wheel drive, were familiar with the campsite and were able to pick her up (knowing that her parents were on the way helped B calm down significantly - Prior to that I was seriously considering emergency assistance. Had we been in a more remote location, I don't doubt that that would have happened with the ammount of vomiting). At 3am, they arrived and drove her home, they were also kind enough to drive me back to my car at the bottom of the mountain.

I should repeat, we were *extremely* lucky to have circumstances in our favour. Safety should always be a number one priority when camping - We came well prepared and with plenty of first aid supplies and experience. That said, I was completely unprepared for this situation. When one thinks of camping emergencies they usually consider exposure, illness, allergies, snakebite, sprains, broken bones, asthma, and other physical problems. Mental issues, however, never once crossed my mind. Had this been a psychotic episode rather than an anxiety attack, I would have had very little idea as to how to respond (and, again, that's coming from someone that once supported a partner through schizophrenic episodes and frightening hallucinations - In a remote setting, everything seems turned on its head).

****

So, here's the message I would like to leave: I understand that mental health is (VERY unfortunately) often considered a taboo topic, but please, **discuss these matters with your party**. Before travelling, ask yourself how you would respond to a mental health emergency such as a panic attack or psychotic episode. **If you - like millions of others - struggle with mental health issues that may lead to a similar situation, please discuss them with the people you're camping with if you can**, even subtly if possible. 

**If you find yourself in a situation where someone in your party starts having an anxiety attack, psychotic episode or any other potential mental health emergency, stay calm and try your very best to be understanding, empathetic and patient** (Edit: User BadDadWhy [also suggests you be polite](http://www.reddit.com/r/camping/comments/153jxp/a_little_safety_and_first_aid_suggestion_that_id/c7j1ig4).). Re-lighting the fire so that the campsite was well-lit helped a lot in my situation, but your circumstances may be completely different to mine.

If you're not sure how you would respond to a person suffering from such an attack or episode:

* ['4 Things You Shouldn’t Say To Someone Having A Panic Attack'](http://thoughtcatalog.com/2012/4-things-you-shouldnt-say-to-someone-having-a-panic-attack/)
* ['How to Help Someone Who's Having a Panic Attack'](http://www.livestrong.com/article/152711-how-to-help-someone-whos-having-an-anxiety-attack/)
* ['Learn First Aid for Psychosis](http://mindhacks.com/2007/09/12/learn-first-aid-for-psychosis/)

*****

**TL;DR**: Friend of mine experienced a post-traumatic-stress related panic attack during a camping trip, started vomiting, shaking and lost a lot of fluid very quickly. **Please consider any possibility of a mental health related emergency while camping with others** - Discuss with your party how you would react to such a situation, even if none of your party members are known to suffer from mental health issues: They might not feel comfortable talking about such very private and sensitive issues, meaning that you may not prepare for them. If you find yourself dealing with a mental-health related emergency in a remote location, be empathetic, caring and understanding to the victim - Try to stay calm, do NOT yell, and make sure to keep an eye out for physical issues that may result (e.g. shortness of breath, loss in fluids from vomiting, etc). Most importantly, stay safe.

I will post this now and when I return from Banff I will try to answer any further questions. I apologize for any disorganization (and grammar/spelling) I am probably ADD and get really excited about telling these stories.

This is the original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/camping/comments/1fel90/all_loaded_up_on_tulemalu_lake_nunavut/


I did this trip through a YMCA wilderness camp that I'd been going to since I was 11, starting on an 8-day trip in the Boundary Waters in northern Minnesota. I progressed through the trips - 11, 14, 20, 30, then 50 days, traversing further north, in the Quetico just north of the BWCA, the Bloodvein and Pigeon Rivers to Lake Winnipeg, and finally the Northwest Territories.

As our group took form we emailed back and forth about routes and planning. In total there were 6 women plus a guide. I was 16, turned 17 during the trip. There were two other women also going into their senior year of high school, 2 starting college, and one going into her sophomore year of college the fall after the trip. Our guide was 24 I believe. We all knew each other from past trips.

We decided to pioneer a new route that no one at our camp or any nearby had done. Baker Lake is the most popular terminus, and there are many rivers and routes to be done - the Thelon, Ballie, Back, Kazan, Kunwak, and Dubawnt. We decided to begin with the Dubawnt, then hook up to the Kunwak and Kazan via the Slow River, which was relatively unmapped, generally used for light fishing, never thru-travel. [Here is our route on Google Maps.](http://goo.gl/maps/vKyp4) This is a rough map, only totaling 550 miles, and doesn't account for curves, double backs and getting lost. Our final mileage was 680 miles.

We all got to base camp in the Boundary Waters after whitewater training on the St. Louis river near Duluth, packed food, organized gear, outfitted our boats and such. Our guide and the camp had organized the plane drops and tickets. TO be clear, our ""session"" was 50 days. The session includes the time we're at camp before the trip, and all the transportation before and after. Day 3 or so we headed out in a big van with two other guides (just drivers) and drove to Points North Landing in Saskatchewan, the end of the road going north. Points North is a mining facility that happens to be on a lake, so they also charter bush plane drops and picks. It took us about 3 days to drive there.

Here is a GEAR LIST oh so exciting:

-[3 canoes](http://i.imgur.com/FYMKMc5.jpg) (Old Town, 2 Trippers and a Penobscot, these are plastic tripping canoes and are quite big)

-7 Duluth packs (one was a SealLine waterproof one we packed all our Thermarests in)

-1 Wanegan (I don't know how to spell that, but it's a plastic kitchen box thing we kept pots, tea and coffee, bulk items like milk, brown sugar, and butter, and the spice kit in, same size as a Duluth pack)

-7 gallons of white gas, individually wrapped in duct tape by me to prevent puncture) 7 was overkill we used 3, donated the rest to Baker Lake when we got there

-2 bear barrels for food (not huge ones, like the size of a mini keg)

-800 lbs of food (we ate like queens, obviously lots of noodles, but we had curried quinoa with coconut milk how can you beat that) I will try to list other meals later, personally I love to read about that shit

-2 Cabelas 4-p tents

-1 screen tent, fo da bugs

-3 Whisperlites

-2 daypacks, 1 for the normal stuff, 1 for lunch which we pre packed every morning in individual containers

-a bazillion tampons


between the 7 of us:

-8 knives

-12 Nalgenes

-10 paddles

-44 pairs of socks (I had 13 of those I love my socks it's my one trail luxury)

-11 books


I fuckin love lists so here's a list about food

-800 pounds

-8 punds of butter yaaa we ate that all

-3 food loops (each one lasting about 2 weeks so you are only dealing with that much food in a bag. the other loops stayed untouched until we needed them)

-I think we brought 12 onions and 8 heads of garlic. we randomly also had 2 potatoes so we made french fries one night.


Sample meals:

-gado gado (""asian"" peanut noodles)

-nature burger (veggies oat burger things taste like the real deal) with bisquick buns and a zillion bbq sauce packets. A few times we stuffed the burgers with Jarlsberg SO DAMN GOOD

-Oatmeal obvs

-coffee cake (baked for REAL it's my favorite trail meal)

-granola of course

-quinoa

-mac n' cheese with parm and Jarlsberg be jealous

-calzones

-quesadillas

-burritos

-Eggs/hashbrowns/cheese (called eggs po cheese)


Lunch is the same every day:

-cheddar

-salami

-tortillas

-trail mix

-Matt food (peanut butter, oats, dried milk, honey all mashed up in a mushy goodness)

-chocolate 

-rehydrated hummus

-dried fruit

One day near the end of the trip we realized the cheese was making us all feel sick after lunch so we broke into our Tillamook aged cheddar that was vacuum sealed and still good. That was a beautiful day.

Have I talked enough about food? I don't know.

ROUTE THINGS:

So we were flown into Wholdaia Lake and paddled the Dubawnt River from there. The Dubawnt was characterized by largish lakes and moderate whitewater. (by largish I mean normal for up there but bigger than most Boundary Waters lakes). We were still below treeline so we were in what's called the [taiga](http://i.imgur.com/rNVu3h.jpg), where it's tundra-like but there are small shrubby trees in patches.

STORYTIME: Our biggest incident

On one girls birthday, the 13th, we ran an easy set just after breaking camp. The last boat to come down got unlucky and was turned sideways around a pillow (rock just under surface). The boat turned upstream and began to fill with water and be crushed under the force of the current. We worked to get the people and gear out after assessing and concluding that it was safe to do so and the boat was stable. Luckily there were large rocks right next to the scene we pulled people and gear onto. One food barrel floated away but we retrieved it. To get the boat free, 4 people stood along it, downstream in the water, and pushed the side up and away from them. I stood on a rock upstream and pulled on a painter line (rope attached to the end of the boat). Another 2 people stayed in a canoe downstream in case anyone floated away. It took a while, but rocking it back and forth it finally was set free from the rock. It was in the water like that for about an hour. We decided to camp and assess damage. The boat had metal gunwales and those were no longer curved but bent (like an octagon as opposed to a nice circle). There were also holes where the plastic bent and creased. These were repaired with epoxy. The yolk and one thwart were busted so we lashed those with p-cord back to the boat. In all it was miraculous that it was okay. Past groups have had the same accident and the boat had been completely shredded and the trip was canceled.

[Shit going down](http://i.imgur.com/rt8MI.jpg)

[Repairs](http://i.imgur.com/m7VcRh.jpg)

Continuing on the Dubawnt, we came to Dubawnt Lake, which is HUUUUUUGE. It's so big ice is on it all year and we weren't sure how long or where we would cross until we got there to see it. We were extremely lucky, we were able to experience the ice and walk around on it and pull canoes across for a little bit, but the wind blew it away in time so we crossed in a timely fashion. It took us just two days, each day we crossed a bay at the bottom of the lake, about 10 miles across each. We had been experiencing pleasant, sunny weather but when we reached Dubawnt lake the temps dropped and we were very very cold while crossing ice.

[playing bumper boats with ice](http://i.imgur.com/Z9yVo.jpg)

[icebrrrg](http://i.imgur.com/YehwJHS.jpg)

Then we reached the Slow River. This was a small river we would be traveling upstream for about a week, the later half the river got very narrow and disappeared altogether. We did what is called Height of Land, where you cross into the next watershed. The Slow River followed a beautiful esker and the landscape was very interesting. We came across an unmarked waterfall and that became our first portage of the trip (day 20, exactly halfway)

OKAY GUYS THIS IS GETTING VERY LONG

I am going to work on the second half of this.

A good 5 gallon paint bucket is a great thing to have in your gear. They are cheap, and you can use them for so many things. With a basic lid or you can spend a little more and get a seat type lid. Keep it right outside your tent and you have somewhere to sit when you are taking your shoes off our putting them on. Put your shoes in the bucket to keep them dry and out of the tent. Keep a plastic grocery bag in the bucket to put trash in. store items you might want to access quickly like flashlights, rain gear, sunscreen, toilet paper, bug repellant. Set it inside the tent during the day when you are out and about. 
By the picnix table you can use one as an extra seat. Store the food that doesn't need to be kept cold. Hang it where the raccoons can't get into it. 
I have an old one that is beat up. I use it as a trash can. Collect fire wood. Fill it with water to douse the fire pit before you leave. Carry the hatchet, fire place poker, log tongs, bellows, mallet, shovel. 
I generally have three of them. 
This goes for car camping,   I camp out of a 4'x6' utility trailer pulled behind a honda cr-v, and I am one of those who brings the kitchen sink into woods. When I pack up the buckets make great storage, I could easily use a couple more. "	t5_2qk80	True

1342482708.0	wo7ge	Best idea I have ever read for food while camping - FoodSaver!	oneofeverything	60	12	27	"I was reading on another message board I am a part of and someone asked about what to cook while camping and there was this brilliant response. This will totally change how I camp in the future! I wanted to share, hoping it might help someone else, too.

Here is the woman's response, copy/pasta:


Ok, my answer is going to be long, but the system I developed really really worked out for me. And not just for camping trips. 

As much as I love tent camping, I'm not thrilled at the whole cooking process at a campsite. Transporting food in a cooler was not fun for me. It seemed something always broke open and the ice melt at the bottom of the cooler wasn't safe to drink because the ground beef ziplock didn't hold and the water was pinkish from the meat. Or the eggs in their special camping container got crunched and there was raw egg all over the ice too. 

Also, I was a single mother, so camping alone just my son and I had to be done in a way that I could maximize our fun time and limit the time at camp for necessities. I'd rather be fishing up until dinner time with him than back at camp with him bored and wanting to wander off to find something fun to do. 

I invested in one of those sealing machines. The pouches from those machines are made to toss into boiling water. That machine made life so much easier for me, both at home and on our camping trips. 

Spare time for packing, shopping, prepping, was in short supply. With my sealing machine, I developed the habit of always cooking extra of any meal that would work as a ""plan over"" for the freezer. I did this throughout the weeks prior to a trip. I wrote the item and the date on them in permanent marker and stacked them flat in the freezer. 

For breakfasts, I made up big batches of oatmeal and separated it into single serving packets with everything but the milk. All the extras, berries, raisins, honey, etc. go into the packet and those are sealed and tossed into my freezer. 

For eggs, I break them all at home and put them into a sealing bag along with the salt and pepper, shredded cheese, pat of butter, green onions, ham pieces, or whatever you fancy. These can be cooked up into omelets by just tossing the egg packet into boiling water or you can empty the contents into the frying pan for scrambled eggs. 

The beauty of using the boiling bags was twofold for me. Everyone can have what they want for their meals and all I have to do is pull the packets and toss them into the boiling water pot. Almost no cleanup too. After they are heated or cooked, just use scissors to cut the edge and transfer to a paper plate. Done. The hot water pot was left covered on the stove for the next meal's pouches. One large water pot and one fry pan is all you need to pack. You can even cook/freeze bacon and hashbrowns ahead of time. 

Since I maintained plenty of pouches in the freezer, we were always prepared for a camping trip (or me getting sick at home and being unable to make meals. We used the stash instead of running for takeout. It was cheaper and healthier to have our own favorites ready to go) 

Right before a camping trip, my son and I would stand in front of the freezer and fill the cooler with whatever sounded good to us, making sure we had a couple of extra things just in case. The items are already frozen, so this cut down on the amount of ice we needed too. 

At the camp site, I kept the pot of boiling water on the camp stove the whole time we were there so it really never cooled down all the way (unless there was snow overnight) At meal times, we both pulled whatever we wanted from the cooler, which was mostly thawed by this time, and tossed it into the boiling pot. My son could have spaghetti and meatballs while I had roast chicken and wild rice. Since we always packed a few extra meals, we could invite any new friends my son made to come eat with us. 

There was no wasted food. At the end of a trip, if there was a couple of packages left, that is what we ate for the next few meals at home, freeing me up to do the camping laundry and relaxing a bit before going back to work. 

You can pack anything that can be reheated from pizza leftovers to your own complicated recipes. Soups and stews are awesome on a cold night in front of a campfire. We took pasta, chicken strips, I rounded out the meals with garlic bread and salads (green, fruit, and potato salad) by putting those into the sealing pouches to float in the cooler to keep them cool but free from melting ice. Garlic bread can be cooked with your S'more fork over the campfire. 

Seriously, whether you are a single parent or a large family, using those sealing machines has been one of the best things I've done to help me. They are also good to store silver (no air means no tarnish) or store photos in a sealed pouch. 

We even made our own mini condiment pouches (ok, my son made these) so we were free from having to drag ketchup, mustard, and relish containers with us too. We typically washed the bigger packets to cut them up and turn them into other types of packets. 

You can also make individual disposable shampoo packets, crushed ice bags for ouchies, single use shampoo containers, cold water, little soft toys, and glitter bits to put on a toddler's lap when shopping on a hot day (keeps them occupied, can't break, and you can refill and reseal and keep them changed up and interesting) You can make frozen fruit squeeze treats too. Once you start using one of these things, you end up finding more and more uses for them. 

Sorry for the mega post, but I really, really learned to appreciate that machine and the time it freed up for me to ride bikes, play catch, cast a few more times for that fish before going back to the camp for dinner.

1342736819.0	wub3e	BIOLITE REVIEW from my own personal experience last weekend.	ICEFARMER	56	6	48	"Okay, lots of videos are already out there so I'm going to stick with the data I collected last weekend and keep it really simple.  I've been busy or I would have posted this earlier.  If you want more specifics I can answer those for you.  I used it continuously for about 6.5 hours last Saturday night and for about another 4-5 hours on Sunday.


**Setup and First impressions:**

Very very well well made. The only cheap thing about it is the crappy little 6"" USB cable they give you with it.  At 2 lbs. 4 oz **(correction 2 lbs 1 oz)** so it's not heavy and is very portable.  They include 4 firesticks as starting aids and a nylon carrying case. (and 4 starter sticks). 

Super easy setup was simple and it works quite well. Power station goes in the side and then flip down three legs.  Easy enough.


**Starting the fire:**

The battery has a bit of residual charge so as soon as you press the power button it starts the fan on Low (it has a low and high setting) which reduces your need to blow on the embers directly. Loading your fuel in is pretty simple it can only go in from the top.  This is where the fire starting can be tricky because there is no side port to add flame at the bottom.  You must load fuel and fire directly from the top.  (They send the biolite with some firestarting sticks but I didn't use them).  If you start fires poorly you will produce a shitload of smoke as the fan pumps air into the chamber.  A recommendation I would make for those who are not confident in their fire starting would be to make a teepee out of small twigs (less than 1/8"" diameter) and put in your hand.  Put your ignition in the bottom and light it (or if you wanna chance it drop it in), blow gently and place your teepee of thin twigs over top.  When the twigs begin to catch the flame (about 2 seconds if you've done it right) turn the power on and it will default to low and it will nicely fan the flames for you. Feed it until it's buring well.  



**Fuel:**

Any dry biomass seemed to work well.  

Starting off I used some very fine tinder and slightly smaller twigs etc. and used some thicker as the flame began.  Size wise for stickes I would say 1/8"" thick or smaller were fantastic to get things starting off.  1/2"" were excellent once the fire got going. It could do some larger but had trouble once they reached about 1"" thick unless I had a really good burn going.  In terms of length, if you are cooking you want to keep them about 6"" or less.  For heat we used up to 10-12"" without problem.  If they get too long some cinders may fall out.  

Leaves and dry grass were no problem.  Chewed through them like nothing.  Also tried cardboard and paper that worked really well.  None of these burned for long.

Pine cones, pine cone, pine cones, pine cones.  These were my favorite fuel of the night and they usually burn like shit unless you have a big really hot fire going..  (I have access to 3 huge pines so they were everywhere).  Dry or even damp worked great once the fire was going.

It burned relatively little fuel. If we subdivided a log it may have lasted for overnight.  That being said you do have to continuously feed it like any fire throughout the night by tossing in a touch more every few minutes and I can see some people getting annoyed by this.  I didn't mind at all.

**BURNS INCREDIBLY CLEAN. I WAS VERY VERY IMPRESSED.** Unless you let the flame die and then you get smoke.  Don't let the fire die or do if you are attempting to clear the entire forest of mosquitoes.

Another note is that it burns best when completely level.  Slight angles affect the airflow and it doesn't burn as efficiently.  This was easy to fix.



**Ash Production:**

Very minimal.  As aforementioned, burned super cleanly.  Very little ash was produced.  We had it running steady and only at 3.5 hours did the amount of ash become a slight problem.  It still functioned well just not at optimal levels.  The fan port is near the bottom of the chamber and as this became restricted with as the efficiency noticeably dropped.  My suggestion to alleviate this was to prepare a new ignition bundle of twigs, etc prep'd and ready to go. Dump the hot ash into a pot and use that to quickly relight your new ignition bundle (as well as reduce risk of random, uncontrolled fires starting) and quickly insert the new material, minus the ash, back into the Biolite.  Total time to do this was about 20-30 seconds.  If you know your way around a flame it's about as quick as changing a bottle of fuel on another stove.


**Cooking:**

I boiled 2 cups of water in a small aluminum camping pot in about 3:55.  The base is extremely sturdy.  I added a little more fuel as we used it to ensure the flame's consistency and turned the fan to the high setting.  Pretty much what they promise.  My wife also made some smores and roasted marshmallows and other foods on sticks over it (which drove me slightly nuts with the anticipation of dripping marshmallow but it didn't happen).  This is a very capable cook stove.


**Notes On Heat Production:**

The design is excellent in that there is very little lateral heat though the materials.  Though not recommended I was able to bare handed move the lit Biolite by grasping both the power station (recommended) and the lower outside mesh of the combustion chamber.  The heat produced out the top was excellent,  It was controlled and hot to controlled and really hot.  The air circulation allows for excellent uniform combustion of materials inside.  


**Charging ability:**

This is kinda the big one everyone seems to care about.  It produced power.  If you hood up a unit like a USB powered LED bar, you will get continuous power.  If you have the USB hooked up to an item with high drain, like a smart phone, it will not continuously power.  It seems to have a battery setup where only excess power is send to the charge unit, which makes sense.  Keep the fire going and use the extra when it comes available.  The way it worked while charging my phone was simple.  After the fire got going for a while, there is a green indicator light that will illuminate on the power station.  When this light is lit, there is extra power available and you can charge via USB.  When you have used the extra charge in full, like when I was using my iPhone 4S, it would charge for about 10-20 minutes (depending on if we had the Biolite on low or high and depending on the flame we had going in it of course) then stop charging for 1-3 minutes before beginning to charge again.  How much does it charge? How fast?  I was able to have my phone, iPhone 4S, increase 20% in 47-50 minutes fairly consistently.


**Take Down:**

After finishing up and emptying the combustion chamber, the low fan automatically stays on (I tried turning it off a few times but it kept kickign back in) and acts to cool the chamber by circulating fresh air inside.  After finishing I was able to disassemble and put it back in it's nylon carrying case in 10-15 minutes.  


**Overall Impressions:**

Very happy with my purchase.  Works very well.  Is very functional.  It pretty much what they promise it to be.  A slight learning curve for ppl not comfortable making fire.  Requires finding or making small combustibles which some people may find annoying.  Needs a few twigs every few minutes so it's not as turn on an forget as a Jetboil or a large fire but used very little amounts of fuel; produces excellent, focused heat and burns exceptionally clean.  I'll probably order a second one so that I can cook two things at once while camping.

Any Questions?

**EDIT: correct weight  is 2lbs. 1 oz. or 935 g.**

**EDIT: I have had people comment on the charging capability. My phone was in use and on while I was using the charger. I had several calls come in and took some photos and a couple of minutes of video with it as well. Would reddit like me to do a test with a drained phone turned off and some charge times that are more strictly monitored? If so I don't know if I'll be able to do it this weekend (going to UFC - yay) but I can try. Let me know.**"	t5_2qk80	True

I've always wanted to just go for a weekend and chill in the woods somewhere, and not have to deal other people. Is this legal? Or reasonable?

Things that may seem obvious to you can still be helpful to others!

Here's a few of mine (forgive me if these have been repeated ad nauseum:

* For trips that last 3+ days, a small supplemental cooler [like this](http://www.amazon.com/Coleman-16-Can-Soft-Cooler-Liner/dp/B006HFBX12/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372480701&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=coleman+cooler) can double the life of your ice. Use it to keep beer cold ( a necessity for me), or as your cold food fridge. Shovel a handful of ice from your main cooler a couple times a day, instead of opening the big one every time you need a fresh one. Ice will last you a week or more.

* [A portable bucket](http://www.amazon.com/Seattle-Sports-Camp-Bucket-Blue/dp/B001F1YI24/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372480910&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=portable+bucket) is worth its weight in gold. Which ain't much because it weighs next to nothing. It rolls up very small and will quickly become one of the most useful things you can bring. Use it by the lake to wash the sand off of your feet, do your dishes in it, wash hands in it, haul water for boiling, and on and on.

* Shave off pieces of a bar of soap into a baggie for washing. Many folks use wet wipes, they just don't to it for me.

* Damp clothes can be dried in your sleeping bag overnight. Your body heat warms it, and your bag will wick away the moisture.

* Buy a [Thermacell](http://www.amazon.com/ThermaCELL-Cordless-Portable-Repellent-Appliance/dp/B0031ESIVK/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372481904&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=thermocell). They can be found in most camping sections or hardware stores and the like. It's the only thing I've used that actually work to keep the bugs away.

* Someone else in this sub recently advised someone else to never pass up a chance to buy old tent poles if you run across them at garage sales or the like. Whoever you are, you are right. New ones are expensive and even if they don't fit your tent, I've rigged up shades and rain shelters with spare poles before"	t5_2qk80	True

I had bought a tent three weeks ago with them, but seeing the deals they had I returned it to take a larger one, and they made no issue whatsoever, which may sound normal...but they also applied a refund on the difference between the price I had paid one week ago for other stuff I had bought and the current sale price of the same items.

Now I want to share that love for camping and nature with my sisters' kids, my 6 year old godchild and his 9 year old brother. Both boys. They spend their days on their iPads, Wii, Nintendo 3DS and my sister keeps them indoors mostly so they wouldn't get dirty or hurt.  
I'm thinking of going to this place for a few days: http://www.goolderheide.be/  
It has a swimming pool and is next to the woods for hiking, cycling and playing.  
My wife and me would sleep in our large basecamp tent and I got a small tent for the boys to sleep in. I prefer to hang my hammock in the wild woods, but with these spoiled kids, that wouldn't work out :)

Now I'm looking for tips to get these kids to love camping and the outdoors.

Recently I've stumbled onto the amazing world of camping in a hammock. I use an ENO DoubleNest that I picked up for lounging and quickly fell in love with it for sleeping in overnight on 2 different trips. My first 5 nights were awesome. Night 6 we got rain, and although I had anticipated it and put up a tarp, I still got cold in 50 degree temps with a 30 degree bag. My back or side, depending on how I laid, would get cold even if it felt warm in the bag.

-There will be at most 20 guys on Saturday night and Sunday morning. On Friday and Monday it will only be about 8.

-Money isn't a big issue, but I am a frugal man. No dietary restrictions.

2/12/2013 We have flooring and a back wall again.  I'm hoping the wall materials we chose will hold up.  The back is going to be insulated with the foam board and then sealed in with spray foam.  As long as we fixed all leaks I don't suppose it will be an issue.  But the camper is now ""campable"". And it is raining today (2/13/13) so I really can't do much with the camper right now.

My friend argues that solo camping with a dog cannot be considered solo camping any more - that the dog provides a level of companionship and comfort that is otherwise not felt on a solo camping trip.  I define solo a bit more loosely and think of it more as two people who are able to talk, do tasks (I still haven't taught my dog to set up my tent yet), and can be responsible for themselves in an emergency situation.

Thoughts?

(My friend's 'winning argument' - at least in his own head - is that I take a two man tent when I have my dog instead of my solo tent.  I have a 105 lb lab mix.  We haven't fit into a solo tent since he was a puppy.)"	t5_2qk80	True

I have hit a wall with our four year old daughter while camping. One that I was unprepared for as parent, so my first post on Reddit is asking for help. Growing up I had siblings to play with while camping. Does Reddit have any advice or tips for camping with a singular child?

We pack card games and various activities but there are moments when being the only kid on camping trip with parents can be tough. At the moment, we can not bring a friend with us as our car does not allow for another passenger.

I do not plan on bringing much on my flight other than a carry-on with clothing, toiletries, quick dry towel, and a flashlight.

We'll be camping at 4 different sites along the Pacific coast as we drive down the 101. My current plan is to buy gear once we arrive in Portland at the local Costco, Walmart, and/or REI. We will also likely donate the larger items upon our departure from San Francisco. While this may seem a bit wasteful, I figure that we're saving at least as much money by camping rather than spending nights at hotels.

Any advice on how to outfit us economically with all the needed gear for our trip would be much appreciated. Thanks!"	t5_2qk80	True

STORY TIME:

They launched the canoe at 3pm-ish and by around 4 were over in another lake via a short portage and had just finished up setting up camp. Now, I've been to this lake system, and once you're out of the main lake, you're basically in a remote area.

As they're finishing up the set up, they notice a single guy in a canoe making their way to their campsite. Nice, a guest. The guy pulls up and announces that he's an ""injured party"" and goes on to tell one of the craziest stories I have ever heard.

So, he was solo camping on a lake over - even more remote - since his friends wimped out on camping. Earlier in the morning of the day he ran into my friends, actually right around sunrise, he paddled over in his canoe to a cliff across from the island he was camping at to grab some photos of the sunrise. Shortly after arriving, he was accosted by a black bear. Now, he was on a cliff, so the bear was blocking his exit. The bear charged, he emptied his bear spray into it, and without any effect the bear charged again. The guy ended up tripping, rolling down a steep incline and falling 30 feet off of a cliff. He miraculously landed near his canoe. Somehow he wasn't dead. Made it back to his campsite, realized his breathing wasn't working correctly. Decided to portage up a 50 degree slope over to the other lake, and managed to find my friends just setting up camp.

My friend is a paramedic in training, so he gave him a quick run down. He was badly cut up on his head [blood matting everywhere] and had a fucked up bruise just a few short inches from his spine. 

They gave him a ride out over to the next lake and helped him over the portage. He ended up paddling down to some cottages to get help getting to shore [there's a marina at a bay in the lake]. Official prognosis - two broken ribs and bruised lungs. He's lucky to be alive.

My friend ended up heading down to gather the solo campers stuff up - found the cliff he fell off, it wasn't a survivable fall by most estimates - and got his stuff back to the marina for a later pick up.

Anyway - craziest thing I've ever heard. Guy is so, so lucky to have made it out without any serious broken bones. Portaging and paddling over 3 km in that state is a miracle.

Be careful out there and make sure you've got some back up plans if you're soloing."	t5_2qk80	True

1359318463.0	17duri	I host trips for my friends on the breaks that we have off of school and I want to plan another camping trip. My trips are non-profit so I have to spend every bit of money we receive. What do you recommend I buy to entertain 20-30 High School/College students who aren't avid campers for five days? 	austkl1	24	3	20	"I hosted three trips in 2012 with the first trip having 12 members, the second trip having 12 members, and the third trip having 17 members. The first two trips we camped at Red Top Mountain on Lake Allatoona and on the third trip we went up to Pigeon Forge Tennessee and rented out a Cabin in the mountains. 
On those trips we struggled with having enough money and it was extremely stressful having to deal with that and school. 
On the upcoming trip which should be in June, I am expecting anywhere from 20-30 members. On this trip I am also expecting to have an **excess of at least $500 and up to $1,200**. The people going on my trips vary from nerds, campers, sportsy people, and preppy people. I was hoping that you guys could help me pick out some things that would be fun and entertaining for everyone and also stuff that could be used on our future camping trips. 

Here is a list of items that I thought up, some are really cheap.

* Volleyball + Net
* Gas $ (*We live within 20 minutes of the campsite*)
* Tiki Torches (*We are renting the peninsula of campsites so we want the whole area lit up*)
* Tiki Torch Gas
* Insect Repllent 
* Canopy
* Fire Wood 
* Charcoal 
* First Aid
* Garbage Bags
* Ice 
 
I already thought of maybe an inflatable trampoline for the lake but those seem to start at $1,200 and go to $5,000 

I live in Kennesaw so if you know of nearby places with fair rates on renting things that could be useful as well.


Also note that on our previous trips we made our own fun on stuff that we did, but I would like to expand my trips to be an official club at my University. In order for me to expand it to a club I would like to have a large following of members who would back me up when I speak to the board of my school and I want to get Fraternities and Sororities involved as well. **We do know how to have fun without expensive items, but you can't say throwing a frisbee is more fun than diving off a trampoline in the middle of a lake.** 

Edit:
I also think that I should mention that my University rents out hammocks and equipment for free to students so we won't need to purchase those types of things. "	t5_2qk80	True

This is for car camping. I have an old six-sided dome tent, but can't get the damn thing up by myself. (I curse you, Tent Gods!)

I bought a new [REI super-luxe family tent](http://www.rei.com/product/827807/rei-kingdom-6-tent-2012), which I adore - but even though I can assemble it on my own, it's a hell of a lot of trouble.

Here are some considerations:

I've had half a lifetime of crawling into a tiny backpacking tent, sleeping on the ground and getting dressed lying down. My old bones won't take it, so comfort is the key.

I'll have to move camp at least once, maybe twice. So my tent has to be very user-friendly.

I'll be living in the tent for a few weeks, so it can't be miserable to hang out in when the weather sucks.

How do I find campgrounds without reservations?	_pandamonium	18	0	10	"Sorry for the long post, I am freaking out. So, **TL;DR**: Going cross country for about 6 weeks. I know basically where we are going, but not when we will be there. Should I just stick with park campgrounds that are first come first serve, even though they don't have things like showers and electricity, or should I try private campgrounds? How can I find private campgrounds, and is it even worth it since we can't make reservations? Can we just wing it?

My boyfriend and I are going cross country in about a week. I've never really traveled much in my life, and I've actually never been camping before. I'm trying to research campgrounds in the areas we'll be and it is EXTREMELY overwhelming. We're driving and I feel pretty prepared in terms of equipment (tent, stove, etc.)

I have a list of places we're definitely going and places we would like to go if we can fit it, and I put it all on a map. I""ve been printing out directions and general info for each place, since we probably won't have much internet access. The problem is, we don't have a strict plan- for example, I can't say ""Ok, so we'll be in San Diego on August 1st, in LA August 2nd"", etc. We're basically seeing what we have time for a how long we want to stay in each place.

I've been looking on the national park websites and seeing what campgrounds they offer. Some are first come first serve, which is great, since we can't really make reservations. But we bought a blow up mattress, and many of these campgrounds don't have electrical hook-ups. From what I can tell, there are many private campgrounds that would have electric, but I don't know how to find them, and I have a feeling I'll need reservations. My boyfriends dad has a KOA card, but in order to look at prices you need to pick a specific campground and put in the dates you'll be staying.

Does anyone have any suggestions? Should we return the air mattress since we likely won't have any way to inflate it? We would like to spend the least amount of money possible, but I have more than enough saved, so our budget is flexible.

We're going for 6 or 7 weeks. Here is our plan: We live on long island, so sunday we will drive to DC and spend the day. We'll start driving that evening to Great Smoky Mountains National Park (in NC/TN) and find a hotel somewhere on the way. After that we're going to Atlanta for a few hours, then New Orleans, to Austin TX. Then New Mexico to Colorado to Utah, then the grand canyon and Vegas. After that we're going to San Diego and making our way up the coast to Washington, then over to Glacier National Park in Montana, down to Yellowstone. After that we're going to the badlands in South Dakota, then Chicago and home.

So my question is, how do you gear up for a week long camping trip, starting with nothing and being ready for anything....without spending a fortune....and in a way that if I hate it I wont be stuck with all this gear?

I've read a lot of specifications of tents that say they have ""Factory sealed seams"" to improve weather protection.  But I've read reviews that of those tents that say they leak when it rains.
My questions:
**Should I buy some seam sealer and go over the seams when I buy the tent.** (possibly voiding any warranty)
**Do all casual camping tents leak and need seam sealer?**
**Are air mattresses really necessary?** (I've seen a lot of people say they are on reddit)


I'm looking for a tent with good ventilation (because it's likely to be hot in South Florida) and one that doesn't leak (it rain a lot down here).

Will have 2 Thermarest Sol pads, 2 bags, and a tent, along with the normal clothes(really, how much should I take?  Ain't taking a shower!), FBC meals, and other random bits and bobs.

Should I strap the pads and bags to the bottom?  Should I give my wife the 2 pads, and I get the tent?  Should they be on the sides, inside, yaddayaddayadda.   

What do you do?  What should I keep close at hand, and what should I bury to the bottom?

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Thank you everyone.  We have rearranged quite a bit.  Tossed clothes, and switched to synthetics we have (plus some more bought).   On our 10 miler test run, we ran into some issues of weight.  Got a light weight tent, and will try sleeping in ONE bag.  That will cut 5 some pounds off.  I'm having issues with hip and upper leg pain, along with collar bone bruising.   Will snag ""special"" foam padding from work this week and use that on my shoulders ;)   I'm sure hip bruising was from jeans,and all the pleats, riviet, and crap.  I'm also not where near fit enough for this weight, so....that will have to be fixed later.

My fiance and I have been talking about going camping for a while now, and I think we're going to try going this spring when it gets a bit warmer.  We've been having some relationship difficulties lately and really feel like the alone time that camping would give us could help things.

I have a little bit of camping experience from when I was younger (only on large commercial lot style campgrounds unfortunately...don't think it's really camping if there is a lodge facility with showers, tvs, and a pool table) and she has no experience at all, so we pretty much need to start from scratch.

I've been looking around on Amazon for gear options since I figured going off of customer reviews would be better than going into a store knowing nothing about what I need and getting upsold without realizing it.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice for someone just starting out, or if there were any good resources out there to help us figure out what we need.  I do have a few specific questions that I was hoping someone could help with.

1. Does anyone have a list of the actual gear that we'd need?  I have a basic idea of what we'd need to bring with us but I'm afraid of forgetting something that we'd need.
2. Can I trust the big stores like REI or Dicks to actually tell me what I'll need?  Or am I better off researching and buying online?

I figure we'll most likely start off at Great Smokey Mountains National Park since it's only a few hours away and seems like a nice place to get a feel for things. "	t5_2qk80	True

I am planning on leaving Friday Aug 16th, not sure how long we will be in the badlands, maybe just driving through the loop.  Saturday morning we will wake up early and head out the a Harney Peak trail head and start the climb.(No idea what we need as far as passes for state parks? I assume we should have some backpacks with water and snacks also.)

After climbing Harney peak, I want to head down and take a tour of the windy caves, or maybe setup camp at a cool spot by a lake.

Leave Sunday morning and head back to Minnesota. 

* Stage 1

[The overall route, Burnsville MN to  Harney Peak
Mount Rushmore, SD, with a stop at Badlands National Park, 9 hour drive.](http://i.imgur.com/MI4smGD.jpg)

 
* Stage 2
[The loop through the Badlands. My first question is, what are the rules with pulling over and taking pictures? Is there a place we can park and then set up a few lawn chairs and smoke a hookah pipe at sunset on a cool ridge with a vista? Do i need some sort of national park pass?](http://i.imgur.com/1qZFbvI.jpg)

 
* Stage 3
[We pull into either Rapid city or Keystone SD.](http://i.imgur.com/0pHA1dO.png)

 
* Stage 4
[We will then head out to a trail head and then climb up to the old fire watch tower on Harney Peak. No idea where the trail heads are or what we need to access them.](http://i.imgur.com/0pHA1dO.png)



Complete amateur here, any help would be welcome, thanks in advance.

------------------------------------
**-Updated Crowd sourced plan-**

* Will be leaving Friday morning to have more daylight in the BadLands. We will get off the loop and park, then walk in until we find a great spot and set up tents and hang out for the night.

* Saturday morning we will arrive at Custer State park. A Redditor recommended Sylvan lake but that camp site is all full! Bummer I know, but next year I will know to sign up early. The closest camp ground that is open Aug 17th is Blue Bell Campground. Its 17 miles away from Harney Peak trail we want to summit. Thats cool I guess, we can drive up from our camp site and park at the base of the mountain next to Sylvan lake? 

* After we do the summit, we will tackle atleast one of the other trails mentioned here.

We kinda wanna keep it pretty local, while keeping it chill. While a few of us can drive, no one owns a car, so we'll be doing it by public transport there and back I suspect, or maybe by stealing a lift, who knows. We're all over 18, and I- at least- have experience, but only as far as Scouting about 4 years ago. We want to build a campfire, and possibly drink, (Maybe, we're not that bothered, no ones a heavy drinker, just like to have our options open). I'm only really aware of Chalfont, but not entirely sure whether that's Scouts+schools ect only. It's a tall order, but any suggestions would be great. Thanks!	t5_2qk80	True

Speaking of Coleman, I'm considering buying a [Coleman party grill](http://www.amazon.com/Coleman-9940-A55-Roadtrip-Party-Grill/dp/B000051TSC), and am curious to see if anyone has anything in the same price range they'd recommend over this particular grill.

So after a ton of research I found the [Eureka Timberline 4](http://store.eurekatent.com/timberline-4-tent) tent. It caught my interest due to its relatively light weight for it's size (7-8 lbs and 61 sq.ft), and I had good experience with the brand. Also, you can add an ""annex"" to it which is basically a huge tarp vestibule which would be great for storing bikes.

The issue is my b/f says A frame tents are uncomfortable. He may be experiencing child hood trauma from A frame Walmart tents, I don't know.

So, I do a good bit of camping and have a Coleman 3-person tent (Sundome model). Nothing to extreme, but having a small tent is something I like a lot. My biggest problem though is that I get wet in it. Far to often.

I don't usually have to worry about water, but I went to Mammoth Cave Nat'l Park (Kentucky) a while back and caught a surprising rain storm. I ended up with about an inch of water in the tent, and having to find a dryer to fix the clothes and sleeping bag. 

It seemed like quite a bit of rain came in through the sides of the tent, especially when the tent was thoroughly soaked. It's not such an old tent, and that worries me.  



So my question is, what full-fly tent would you recommend that is reasonably priced and a 3-4 person tent. Also, any tips on staying dry?



**Edit**: Here is a list of the tents recommended so far. Perhaps this will also help in the future for others. I really would like to thank everyone for helping.

I have a [Coleman Fold N Go Grill](http://www.amazon.com/Coleman-Fold-Go-Portable-Grill/dp/B001RTY0JA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1335127639&amp;sr=8-1) , and a [Coleman PowerPack 1-Burner stove](http://www.amazon.com/Coleman-2000004125-PowerPack-1-Burner-Stove/dp/B0009PUS6M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1335127745&amp;sr=8-1). I have a cast iron skillet, and my friend usually brings an electric griddle. There is also a fire pit at the site. I'm looking for insight  on what else would be a good buy for cooking purposes. Also looking for some tasty, easy camp meals. We always do tips, grilled chicken, salmon, mixed veggies, and home fries.	t5_2qk80	True
1335017248.0	sl97w	I need recommendations for a new Boy Scout	Reddittorswife	14	0	35	"I have a son who just 'aged up' into Boy Scouts.  He will be camping most months (he is off camping right now) and he needs his own 'stuff'. Plus the boy went and outgrew his sleeping bag!

Right now when we camp we have one giant tent, and share all the family stuff.  We are light/smart packers, but still it has always been car camping.

So I know nothing about hiking camping, I read about things weight too much, but I really don't know what weight range I should be looking for.  I don't even know how much weight an average 10 year old can carry?

I would prefer not to have to buy multiple times, so something that will stay with him for at least 4 years (when his little brother will age up into BS)  would be nice, but preferably something that will last till he is an Eagle (and maybe with a job to buy his own?)  So his little bro doesn't feel it is always hand me downs (well it mostly is but...)

So prime importance, a backpack, second a sleeping bag, and third a tent (we have a 4 man, but it was designed for car camping)

Any suggestions, guidelines to follow or general advice?

Edit : Thank you all for your advice!  We got him a backpack, adjustable size, and a few other features.  We are still debating on a sleeping bag (partly because the next two camps in May and July will be pretty warm, so the old slightly too small one wont hurt), and apparently they troop does have tents, just he has previously gone with my husband and used our old one.  So that will wait awhile.  Again THANK YOU!"	t5_2qk80	True

1363739269.0	1ampvg	I'm looking to buy new gear - tell me what you carry for a few day trip!	my_throw_away123	14	1	10	"Basically as the title states.. I'm relatively new to camping, so I don't have much and trying to stay with a budget. The place where my buddies and I go requires hiking a couple miles through some tough trails (for me anyways), so the lighter the better. I'm very interested in combo tools, you know, an ax/hammer type stuff and anything else you think should be essential.

-Coleman 2 person tent (that I'm looking to replace with a hammock very soon, but the tent works fine for now). It has a rain cover and doesn't weigh an awful lot, so replacing this is not a huge priority.

-some random sleeping bag, relatively thick and warm, but it's very heavy and sucks on a long hike.. I'm looking for cheap suggestions here.. 

-pillow - what do you use? I find I don't even really use one in colder weather and I'm thinking about just getting an air pad for under my sleeping bag. It would deflate and roll up much smaller than a normal pillow and fill the roll of a pillow/sleeping pad..

-cheap collapsible saw - looking for suggestions here.

-ax or hatchet? I'm in Ky and it'll be cold at night for the next couple months, so fires are necessary. I've only ever chopped wood with a full size ax, never a hatchet.. Is a smaller/sturdy hatchet better overall for hiking/chopping or would a lightweight camping ax be a better option?

-machete or a large knife? - all my friends carry a machete and I don't particularly see the big deal about it, I normally just carry a large collapsible knife, but I want something sturdier.. Something larger with a belt loop would be great. What uses are there for machete's when camping in the mid west? I guess a really thick one could be used as an ax, but then it'd be heavy as hell..

-multi tool - I just have a small, cheap one...

-headlamp and flashlight - I bought a cheap headlamp and led flashlight from harbor freight and had no idea how essential these were be.. So instead of cheaping out, I want better ones.  I found the headlamp is more essential, I want an LED one, smaller the better. For the flashlight, a cheaper (~$20) one without much weight is ideal.. Something I can clip onto my belt and forget about, rather than put in my pack..

-stove? - we just bring with canned food and other snack items..we cook the cans in a wood fire.. This is *ok*, but I'd like something more convenient and faster. The Trangia seems like it would be a good one, but I'm not sure.

-backpack - I have a really nice National Guard backpack that works great, but again, I welcome any suggestions..

-boots - I just have a cheap pair of waterproof ""hiking"" shoes, but they hurt my feet bad. Over a 3 day trip, hiking around ~17 miles, my feet were all blistered up. I'm not sure what route to go here.. A pair of Vibrams seem like they would be awesome during summer, but I'm not sure how they would be when it's cold out at night.

-butt pad or small chair? - we have a fire pit with rock chairs around it at our spot and some sort of pad would be awesome..

I haven't gone camping in quite a while- and my boyfriend has never been, so this year I am buying him a tent for his birthday and we are going to go camping! Growing up, my dad was supreme outdoorsman, but we only ever went camping at designated campgrounds (secluded sites, but still more amenities than at a state park). This time, i'd like to give it a real go and head out to some state parks here in Massachusetts. 

Here's the hitch. I have a 7 year old staffordshire terrier. He is well mannered, likes other dogs, people, and does not bark often. He is a little older, however. I adopted him when he was 3 and he has not spent time outside very often except when hiking- certainly not with the extreme freedom of going camping for a weekend.

My boyfriend is worried about him freaking out and destroying the new tent (nails through the floor, knocking the thing down, etc).  I am worried about what to do with him once we are actually situated. He does have a crate, but it is large and I think it would be kind of weird to bring it. My boyfriend thinks it would be good to have just in case. 

Does anyone have any advice about how to ease my urban dog into the camping lifestyle? Has anyone gone camping with a dog that is not accustomed to the outdoors? What do I look for when trying to find a campsite online? What are the rules about state parks and camping- am I only allowed to camp at designated camp facilities?

TL;DR- I want to go camping with my dog, but i'm nervous about his lack of experience. "	t5_2qk80	True

I have a ton of time off this winter and am looking to do some winter hiking/camping. I've been out a lot in the summer in my hammock, but never in the cold. It was -20C today where I live. Anyway, I don't really have any winter supplies or experience. My summer pack list is basically my hammock, blanket, rainfly, pot, cokecan stove, spoon, ax, book, rice and beans and tea.

I usually go pretty light, but I don't want to freeze to death. I'm assuming I will need an underquilt and a better sleeping bag. I plan on going out in snow shoes. *Here are some questions...*

**Anyone have any experience using the cokecan stove in the winter?**

**Can I skimp on the temp rating for my sleeping bag if I use an underquilt? If I have a good sleeping bag, do I need an underquilt?**

We are up in western Washington State, so there are beautiful easier hikes everywhere.  Well after going on a bunch of different day hikes, we decided that we want to try camping.  And by we, I mean my wife.

We are going to do a ""real"" camping trip this weekend.  By that I mean, we are packing up backpacks and hiking down one of the beaches before setting up a tent.  Now we aren't going in blind here, we are going with friends who camp alot, and know the area we are going to.  They basically planned the trip, then invited us to go with them.  

But we want to make it seem like we are on our own some.  To see if we could handle it on our own.  We are carrying our own tent (that we are borrowing), our own water, our own food, and our own clothes.

I will be riding from Chicago, and camp through the Badlands, the Black Hills, Mt Rushmore, and he will be riding from Los Angeles and meet me in Cody (or somewhere around there) for the Yellowstone leg of the trip. 

We have a few questions about our draft itinerary, and we hope that folks here that have been both to the Badlands area and Yellowstone (we haven't been to either) can give us advice on do's and dont's, both for the camping/hiking part of things and for the motorcycling/scenic road part of things. 

Our draft itinerary at the moment is the following ([here on google maps](https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Chicago,+IL&amp;daddr=Fairmont,+MN+to:Badlands+National+Park+to:Mount+Rushmore+National+Memorial,+Keystone,+SD+to:Cody,+WY+to:Yellowstone+National+Park,+WY+to:Grand+Teton+to:Chicago,+IL&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.946714,-97.910156&amp;spn=18.633101,33.881836&amp;sll=43.389082,-99.140625&amp;sspn=17.938918,33.881836&amp;geocode=FWICfwIdGuDG-inty_TQPCwOiDEAwMAJrabgrw%3BFVIUmgIdZaNe-ik1wPcJkX7zhzGnzP1f_Y_KAw%3BFVyNmwIdEH3s-SHwd-baMV5oaSkjIAUYDId-hzHwd-baMV5oaQ%3BFZaNnQIdPF_V-SFBxlwFvj312inf1j612DV9hzFBxlwFvj312g%3BFQZrpwId7e1_-Sldvlshvx5MUzFQzM08RvR2ug%3BFa3VpQId1ZRo-SG74Y80MPmorClVVVVVVeVRUzG74Y80MPmorA%3BFYhJnAIdGCxn-SE3o5HMjrigpSmpG13JnlFSUzE3o5HMjrigpQ%3BFWICfwIdGuDG-inty_TQPCwOiDEAwMAJrabgrw&amp;oq=Chicago&amp;mra=ls&amp;t=m&amp;z=5)) 

* June 17-18: ride solo from Chicago to the Badlands. Sleep in Fairmont on June 17, and then at a KOA or other camping at the Badlands. 
* June 19-20-21: Badlands/Black Hills/Mt. Rushmore area: riding + hiking
* June 22: ride solo to Cody / Yellowstone NP
* June 23-27: Yellowstone/Grand Teton area
* June 28-30: road back to Chicago/Los Angeles 

Now, a few questions: 

* 1) We are not American and we never camped in the US, so we don't know KOA very well: we are looking for peace and quietness. Should we stay away from them? 
* 2) Does anyone have a good camping suggestion for any of these places, for either a tent or a rustic log cabin or a good motel (we may need a night in a motel here and there, depending on how sore our behinds are...)?
* 3) When I am in the Badlands, is it worth changing camping every night, and sleep closer to Mt. Rushmore, the Black Hills? Or is it better just to pick one location (Rapid City?) and then tour from there? 
* 4) Yellowstone: we have 5 full days: is it enough/too much? I know the park is huge, and our idea is to both have some good rides while there (max 200/300 miles per day) but also a few good hikes.
* 5) Yellowstone: should we stay in Cody? I am leaning towards staying there, because I am coming from Chicago and it is a LOOOOOONG way back, and Cody is closer to home...but is there another location anyone recommends? 

Anything we should know? Anything we shouldn't miss? Anything we should definitely try and avoid? 

Also: how likely am I to cross a grizzly bear while I rid my bike in Yellowstone???"	t5_2qk80	True

I have a  [Banjo SQ14](http://www.amazon.com/Bayou-Classic-SQ14-Single-Outdoor/dp/B0009JXYQ4) for homebrewing.  On top of that, I put a weber charcoal grate (not the grilling piece but the piece that holds the charcoal off the bottom), added some lava rock and letter rip.  The flame isn't as high as I want but the lava rock definitely holds and disperses the heat well.  I'll take pictures - we'll see how it goes...

There's alot that I don't know or don't understand about coolers.

How large of a cooler do i need for my family and the length of our outtings? I'm guessing between 50 and 120 quarts...

How should ice be placed in the cooler?  Should it be layered in the bottom of the cooler with food placed on top or should the ice be dumped on top of the food?   

Do any coolers have dividers or organization within the cooler?  I always hate having all my food floating in the bottom of the cooler.  I also hate having everything just kind of thrown into the cooler.

Is there any benefit to using ice packs instead of ice?  Do they last longer or stay colder?  I know plenty of people use frozen water bottles to keep their food cold in the cooler.

The one time I did use it, it leaked from one poorly stitched point in a seam.

I think I might be able to fix the seam leak (and might as well redo all of them) with seam sealer (any opinions on this?), but the stuff I'm reading seems to suggest that I should also refresh the durable water repellent (dwr) on the floor and sides.

The youngest campers are our twin sons (7) and my two teenaged daughters and one five year old Golden Retriever.  

Due to the numbers of us, we need decent/not great gear that won't turn this trip into an expensive three or four days in Vermont.  WE have almost nothing in the way of gear.  

Can folks recommend general brands for tents, sleeping gear and cooking?

I would like to just cook over the open fire pit rather than buy a crappy little stove, but not sure if this is wise considering the size of our brood? Are the Colemans that bad?  We aren't hiking, but would like to when our sons get a bit older and more familiar with the idea of sleeping in a tent/can help haul their own stuff.

Sleeping pads or mattresses?  Should a pad be good enough for the younger kiddos?

1375748637.0	1js0ax	I always get a horrible sore throat when I go camping - what can I do to avoid this?	pholland167	13	3	31	"Some background:  I live in Colorado - camping opportunities abound.  But I typically only go a couple times each summer.  Mostly car camping, with an occasional short hike in somewhere.  Always build a fire (I'm sure this doesn't help the throat).  Always consume alcohol (I'm sure this doesn't help the throat).  Almost always smoke pot (I'm sure this doesn't help the throat).  Don't smoke cigarettes.  I am usually pretty good at drinking plenty of water - I know the effects of altitude, so I try to be good about the water.  I have a mummy-type sleeping bag which mostly forces me to sleep on my back, which I don't do at home.

On every camping trip I've gone on in the last few years, I wake up in the middle of the night with a horrible sore throat.  I am pretty sure that I'm getting mountain boogers in my nose, so I can't breathe through there very well, so I breathe through my mouth all night and dry it out.  Combine that with alcohol and smoke, and it seems like a recipe for disaster.  But rarely do my camping partners have the same problem as I do, even when we partake in the same recreational activities and sleep the same way.

Now I know - cut out the alcohol and smoke (both campfire and weed) and it would probably solve many of my throat problems.  I don't really want to cut any of those out - I like to have a good time when I'm in the back country (and yes, we are always very good about packing EVERYTHING out - I'm not leaving beer cans all over a site or anything like that).

My family and I went all the time back when I was young and I remember enjoying it immensely but don't recall a lot of the actual memories as a result from TBI occuring while deployed. 

Now, my wife and my two year old son are going camping for our first time, we're going somewhere in the New England region, it's kind of a surprise from my wife but she has disclosed that we'll be at a drive up camp site with an open fire that has a grate for keeping pots and pans on. We'll be using a four person tent and down mummy sacks rated to 3°C.

What are your dos and don'ts for camping? And any other advice and tips?

Thank you.

Result: We ended up using the mummy sacks as under-blankets for our air mattress. Between our two year old son and our 3 year old pup it was a challenge for us to keep watch on them while attending to camping necessities. Overall, I had a great time with it and our neighbors didn't seem to mind and actually enjoyed their rambunctious nature. The weather was amazing and hiking did well to drain our son's energy. My wife is of the mindset to not go again until our son is more tempered but I know I can persuade her otherwise. It was a great first camping trip! thanks for all your input everyone!"	t5_2qk80	True

I probably need a lot of help from you more experienced types.

I'm just gonna list everything so it is easier to read

* I'm not quite sure what parks I'm allowed to stay in for a long period of time (4 days). How can I tell what's allowed?

* Money is pretty tight. I naively assumed that camping would be free. Dumb I know. Any pointers on how to get cheap entrance and stay fees?

* Supplies. I'm aware that I'll need tents, sleeping bags, towels, clothing, lighters, knives, and canned foods. Any essentials that a first timer wouldn't think about?

* What activities are there to do? I imagine hiking and playing board games can only last a day or two

* How do I stay hygienic? I figure some campgrounds will have shower facilities for tourists but what about those that don't? Baby wipe showers? Oh, and how do I know which parks have showers..?

* **MOST IMPORTANTLY** Do you have any campground suggestions? I'm thinking that we'll stay near the bay area, maybe an hour or two away. I guess the most important requirements are a cheap fee if any and places where we can stay for several nights.

Thanks for all the help and suggestions, I'll be watching this thread like a hawk. I'll also update any questions I have, because I will probably have more. Thanks everyone

I'm looking for any tips, suggestions, or any tokens of wisdom you guys think I should know or consider. Thanks in advance.**

I've been camping a few times, but always with groups where I didn't have to bring lots of gear or worry about much. I'm hoping you can give me some tips on what gear to get, or whatever suggestions or thoughts you think someone who wants to do the type of camping I'm planning on doing should know.

I live in Nashville TN, so if you know any good spots like what I want around here, by all means, tell me.

The tent I've recently bought is huge. I bought it because of the great reviews, and because it was a steal. It's way bigger than what I need, with just me and my dog, but I plan on it lasting a few years (hopefully) and I plan on going with other people too, so others can use it if they need to. But due to it's size and weight it pretty much rules out much hiking. I do want to be by a lake. At least on the first trip this summer, and probably a lot after that. 

The type of sites I'll be looking for are by water, able to drive/boat to. And preferably **without** facilities. (Those sites tend to be crowded and dirty in my experience.) I'm looking for something peaceful, private but easily accessible. 

What I would like from you pros, if you would be so kind, are suggestions on what gear you think is essential for this type of trip. Something a novice like me might overlook, but would probably find useful had I brought it. I've already got things like the tent, lighting, and bug spray covered. I'm also going to get a gas stove, what I need to make a fire, and probably a survival shovel also. (or do you think that's overkill?) Any things you can think of that you've found useful that I might not think of? Any techniques, principles, lessons you've learned or ""rules to live by"" you think I should keep in mind? Any product brands you favor for certain gear?

1362557077.0	19rkpf	Makeshift side of HW Camping Tips for a Newb	flyingsofast	10	0	3	"Hey  

I'm looking to do some ultralight cycling hammock camping this summer. I realize each of those are different subreddits but decided to post here as my questions are more general.  

I'm in Southern BC Canada. These trips will most likely be in Northern Washington. Vancouver Island and The Okanagen Valley. I don't plan to bring much in cookware if anything. I'll most likely stop, and buy/eat food at restaurants/grocery stores along the way. Buy enough for the night throw it in my bag and stop somewhere the next day.

I'm going to be cycling ~200km's a day and can't guarantee getting to an actual campsite at any time. I figured as long as I have a tent/hammock I could throw it up just off the side of the highway for the night. 

As someone who hasn't done a ton of camping in actual wilderness before the idea of being so exposed to wild animals scares the eff out of me. I know only a couple basic things like:  
 - Don't keep anything scented in the tent at all. ANYTHING scented (toothpaste/deodorant/soap/food etc) and to tie it off a little ways away from where I sleep.  
 - Sleep with a stick and if something comes sniffing just wack the side of the tent.

I'd feel way more comfortable knowing a lot more. What resources can I check out websites/books/blogs for this kind of just of the road camping style?

I'm still trying to make some decisions about my gear. Because it's going to be winter, I've decided to add a couple pounds and go with a decent tent that can keep me dry if shit really hits the fan.

The Hilleberg Akto is like a universal standard for cold weather ultralight stuff. Only drawbacks are price, a bit of weight, and it doesn't vent very well. (Moisture builds up on the inside of the rain fly in wet weather). It's also a bit time consuming to set up.

The MSR hubba is 1 lb lighter and a lot cheaper, but still has ventilation problems and some people have reported snow and rain blowing under the bottom of the rain fly in severe weather. It's also not as sturdy for strong winds. It's much faster and easier to set up though.

Until then, please regale me with tent-trailer related advice and horror stories if you would.  I have heard the canvas and hoist-cable systems are important things to carefully check out when buying used.  Wheel bearings will be the first thing I replace.  Tell me, what do you know now that you wished you knew when you were buying yours?  What favorite features are a must, and what can you live without?

We are lucky in that we don't have to stick to a set schedule and spend more or less time wherever as we please, we have about a month from late August-September.. however that makes for a problem in planning because we don't really want to reserve lodges/campsites and then feel like we have to rush and get to these different places on time. Ideally, we just want to casually make our way across the country, again stopping wherever looks good and isn't crazy crowded. Does this sound feasible? Do we *need* to plan and reserve in order to camp? Will there be nasty surprises where we won't be allowed to camp somewhere and will get stuck having to pay for a lodge? Can we really just pull off to any exit that has a KOA/campground sign and pitch our tent for the night? We are just going to be in a little Mazda with a tent, sleeping bags, and basics- are there RV only places?
