1300332808.0	g5mc2	I believe Adrian Lamo, the hacker turned snith who turned in Bradley Manning, has been brainwashed.	learnmore	27	10	9	"My theory is they brainwashed this kid, manchurian candidate style, MKUltra, or whatever.

Before May 2010 he had the exact opposite opinion about hacking. In less than a year he's undergone a complete change in opinion, mannerisms, vocal cadence, and appearance. He's hardly recognizable compared to who he once was. This young man has had his spirit and soul drained from him.

Watch this and pay close attention to his mannerisms. This is him pre-May 2010 in unreleased footage for a documentary about hackers: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbsyjQh03Xs&amp;t=5m54s

More interviews and documentary footage of Lamo from before his April run in with the police. Lamo in the Hackers Wanted documentary. He speaks eloquently and never loses focus of the subject matter. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGTYyltYi80

Here he is again in a Tech TV interview from 2003: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_SwtWu2HXk

Now he struggles to articulate himself, stammers, blinks heavily, completely monotone, and has a scar above his left ear. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPsSRaoOo2k

I think this is when they had something done to him, from a Wired magazine article:

""In May 2010 Lamo reported his backpack stolen. The investigating officer noted unusual behavior by Lamo and detained him. He was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome after having been placed on a 72-hour involuntary psychiatric hold, which was extended to a total of nine days.""

There are now reports that Bradley Manning also appears to be catatonic and having severe problems communicating. If they're doing this to Lamo what is keeping them from doing this to Bradley Manning?
I'm thoroughly creeped out by all this.

Edit: Interesting article picking up on this in November. http://fdlaction.firedoglake.com/2010/12/23/bradley-manning-and-the-convenient-memories-of-adrian-lamo/

Edit2: Lamo has worked for FBI or NSA, [german news source](http://www.faz.net/s/Rub475F682E3FC24868A8A5276D4FB916D7/Doc~EB7743084C84B417480B1175808764D35~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html) google chrome translate for the win.

&gt; After that Lamo is a security specialist that the secret ""Project Vigilant"" worked for ( https: / / www.projectvigilant.us/ ). This project was Mark Rasch with donations from the business founded by. Quickly headed for nine years, the Internet Crime Unit of the U.S. Department of Justice and took for his project top people on board, including Ira Winkler, the NSA (National Security Agency) for FISA activities (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) is responsible was observed and foreign intelligence agencies.

1361578343.0	191wye	I cannot believe what just happened to me in court.	lonelliott	21	6	16	"I do not understand what just happened.  So, back story.  My ex wife has kept me from seeing my kids for 9 years.  The whole time moving 9 times to different states and cashing that child support check.  Oh, and she has 6 kids with her boyfriend after my 2 kids.  Not even exaggerating.  So, I get a letter 1 year ago saying that there is an investigation.  My ex's boyfriend is under investigation for touching my 12 year old daughter.  

Now I am angry.  Beg, borrow steal and do what I have to in order to get 5 grand to pay a lawyer.  This is going to stop.   I am going to see my kids.  

Get court ordered phone talks twice a week and I get to drive to where they live one weekend a month for 4 months.  So, on top of the child support, on top of the lawyer, I now spend huge amounts of money monthly to go and see my kids as well as take 2 days off of work every month.  I have to drive 8 hours to where they live, pay for 4 nights in a hotel, then drive home the 8 hours.  Pay for all food and all expenses.  The first weekend was close to a grand.  Then I trimmed it down and its roughly 500-700 a weekend with all expenses.  That is on top of the monthly child support and paying a lawyer.  I have completely wiped out my savings paying for all this and have no vacation time left at work.

The whole time my lawyer says, dont worry, this is only temporary.  Soon we will have a hearing for visitation and she will have to drive half way.  Awesome, I can do that.  Its still like 200 dollars in gas per visit, but I can manager that. 

So today, we have the hearing, I dont have to be there.  My lawyer emails me the paper work, and I cannot believe the huge dick I just took in the ass.  

So now, I have monthly visits starting in a week, going through September.  The trial is on September 1st for permanent visitation.  Oh, but any visit under 7 days, I have to do all the driving.  30 hours of driving over a 4 day period for the visits.  Or, I could just stay where they live, in a hotel, and pay for 5 nights in a hotel and take off work 3 days a month for the visits.  The only visits she has to met me half way are 3 visits in July, June and August because they are 2 week visits.

Who can afford something like this?  Money aside, lets say I could afford it, which I can't.  Who can take off 3 days of work a month?  That is 5 weeks a year in just time off work for visits?  Who can do that? 

So now, if I cannot meet this schedule, I am a dead beat dad right.  I am worthless.  I let my kids down.  I have to know, that the guy investigated for touching my daughter gets to tell them every night how much dad does not love them, or he would visit.  The courts say he can, why doesn't he?

Its fucked up man.  I feel worthless.  I feel like I have failed my kids.  My daughter needed me and what could I do?  Nothing.  Not a fucking thing.  Now I have to tell my son and daughter that their daddy cant make it.  Cant come and visit.  For what?  Because my dirty whore of an ex wife keeps spitting kids out and the courts side with her.  Oh, no, its ok, you have too many kids and cant fit them all in a vehicle, dont worry, we will make the dad drive.  You just keep having kids and we will keep paying for them.  Oh, and her fucking boyfriend, who has lived with her for 9 years, wont get a divorce from his wife.  My kids tell me stories about the shit he does.  He gave my 11 year old son a fucking cross bow for Christmas.  Not a toy, I have seen it.  A fucking cross bow.

When I skype with my kids, they have web cams setup in each room.   I see them.  Oh, they say, thats so mom can stay in her room with the new baby and watch us.  When we do something wrong, she calls us on these walkie talkies.  I am not making this up.  So the guy, under investigation for touching my daughter, has access to a webcam in her bedroom?  But none of this fucking matters.  None of it.  The state does not care.  The police have been to her house numerous times.  He has been arrested numerous times.  Oh, and they live 11 people, 9 kids and 2 adults, in a 2 bedroom house. Oh yes.  2 bedrooms.  

I live on 3 acres of land, with 2 spare bedrooms setup and waiting for their arrival, but that is not going to happen now.  What the actual fuck.  How is this possible?  How can our court system work like this?  How can the courts not see her situation for what it is?  How can they continue to let her abuse the situation and allow my kids to live like that when they have a great home just waiting for them?

Its enough to just say fuck it all.  Why do things right?  Why work hard and hire a lawyer?  What does it get you?  How does it even help you?  I.  I just dont understand.

tl:dr The court system screws yet another father

edit:  When I say keeping me from seeing them, I mean I have no idea where they live because she moves so much.  I only know now because of the paperwork I received from the state she lives in saying her boyfriend is being investigated by social services for touching my daughter.  Oh, which was dropped because he refused a polygraph.  The official report says it cannot confirm nor deny the accusation.  The home is still listed as being a high risk environment.  No follow up visits by social services.  Oh, and the month the investigation was happening, he was supposed to move out, but my ex wife sent my daughter to stay at a friends house for the month.  Then when social services said they could do nothing, she came home, to live with the guy she says touched her.  What the fuck.  How is that even possible legally.

Edit 2:  Here is the kick in the nuts.  Every year for 9 years, my kids have been able to go to my parents house for the whole summer, with one caveat.  If I even call my parents house while the kids are there, my ex wife swore my parents would never see them again.  So, I could not even call my own parents for 3 months out of the year and suffered that because my kids at least had a healthy environment and could see my parents for 3 months.  My ex wife did this for nothing more than spite.  The whole time my parents knew where my kids were and where the always lived, but were not allowed to tell me."	t5_2qh6z	True
