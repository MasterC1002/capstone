Recipes are one step up. Including the recipe is a very nice addition to your photos. It makes it so somebody can replicate roughly what you've made. 

What we **really** need is **content**: tips and tricks you have learned through trial and error, comprehensive guides to master individual steps, discussions on your bread-making tools and which ones are your favorites, videos and documentaries that share the passion of breadmaking... you get the point.

**My intention isn't to be preachy, as I've posted photos of my work, too.** My problem is, though, that I've seen ages-old forums with really bad formats that teach me better tips (like ice-steaming), but it takes digging through pages of comments.

So, first I want to say that I'm really happy that this has brought about real discussion about the bread baking process among the /r/breadit community! I think that's what some people were looking for. I know that a few have disagreed a bit with these steps, but as I've said, this is how I learned it and it's worked for me for years. Just for context (probably should have done this in the first place) I have an associates in Baking and Pastry arts, learned at the New England Culinary Institute. I spent about 14 years in the food industry building a varied resume to include working in pastry kitchens and artisan bread bakeries. I no longer work in the food industry and now do satcom and IT work as Army enlisted. That, of course, is a story on it's own, so I won't delve into that one. **/end edit**


I've seen some demand for more content oriented posts that could possibly bring some discussion to the table, so I thought I'd post this and see where it goes. Hopefully some of you find it interesting.

I have a crappy food blog that I post to occasionally as a hobby, and one of the things that I enjoy posting about is bread. This is the first in a series that I called Bread Baking Basics.

**The Twelve Steps of Baking**

*Scaling* – This is the measuring of all ingredients before mixing. All ingredients should be weighed when possible. This is the most accurate form of measuring in a kitchen. A cup of flour does not equal the same weight as a cup of sugar. A cup of flour on Tuesday may not even weigh the same as a cup of flour on Friday. If you plan on baking a lot at home, it will be necessary to get an accurate scale. This will help ensure a consistent product almost every time.

*Mixing* – Mixing is everything! This is where you control 80% of how your final product will turn out! Mixing can be done by hand or with a machine, such as a Kitchenaid style mixer (using a dough hook, of course.) There are two steps in the mixing process. The first step in mixing is incorporation. All ingredients are added into the mixing bowl in a certain order and then the mixing begins. Here's a rundown:

* Add water
* Add yeast
* Add flour
* Add Salt
* Add remaining ingredients
* Start mixing (on speed one if using a machine)

This seems simple enough, but it's necessary. The flour acts as a barrier between the yeast and any other ingredients that might have an adverse effect on the yeast, such as salt. Once the ingredients are very well incorporated, then we can start the second step, which is called development. This is where we develop gluten.

*Bulk Fermentation* – Now we do the first and primary fermentation. Fermentation is a biological process from the yeast. Yeast eats sugar and break it down into alcohol, carbon dioxide and various acids. The alcohol burns off in the bake, the carbon dioxide gets trapped and makes the dough rise, and the acids add flavor. The longer and slower the fermentation process, the better the flavor.

*Punch and Fold* – This step is kind of a part of the bulk fermentation step. Once the dough has doubled in size, then we will degas the dough, which redistributes the yeast, and then we fold the dough a few times, which helps to further develop the dough and redistributes the heat that is caused by fermentation. After punching and folding, we continue the bulk fermentation once more. 

*Divide* – After the bulk fermentation and punching has been done, the dough is divided into its proper weight for the final dough shape. Loaves are usually divided into one to two pound loaves. This step is often more appropriate for bread professionals who are producing many loaves, requiring pounds and pounds of dough. For a lot of us at home, we're only making one loaf of bread, so dividing won't be necessary.

*Pre-shape* – Once the dough has been divided into pieces, the individual pieces are then rounded into a ball, called a pre-shape. In some cases, the pre-shape will actually be more of an oblong or football shape, as would be the case for making a long baguette. Pre-shaping helps with development and makes it easier to do a final shape.

*Bench Rest* – Handling the dough will toughen it up a little and cause it to be too elastic and difficult to work with, so it will be necessary to let the gluten relax and become more extensible again. A small amount of fermentation continues during the bench rest, but not a whole lot. Bench rest usually lasts from twenty minutes, up to an hour depending on the dough type.

*Final Shape* – Now the dough is shaped into its final shape. Common shapes are boules (rounded) or batardes (football) but there are hundreds of different shapes out there. The final shaping influences what the bread will look like when it is finished, and it helps to create surface tension, which is necessary for a good oven spring.

*Final Proof* – The final shape(s) need to sit in a warm spot, covered, and rise to their final poofiness. Generally, the dough will double in size. Proofing will take some practice, though. Not proofing enough will cause the dough to burst when it's being baked. Proofing it too much might cause the dough to not rise enough, as the gluten will have stretched too much. In some cases, the bread could fall completely. 

*Bake* – Bread baking is one of the shortest steps of the process, and often the most rewarding. Or disappointing. There are some things to know before throwing that bread into the oven, however. First of all, your oven is not a commercial one, so don't expect commercial results. Commercial ovens are designed to keep within a certain temperature range at all times. Not so much with your oven at home. If you set your oven at 400 degrees F, expect temperatures ranging from 375 - 425 degrees F. Bread ovens are also equipped with steam capabilities. Steam helps to create better oven spring and will interact with the starches on the surface of the bread to create a sheen and enhance browning. There are things that can help adapt your oven, however. Invest in a baking stone. Sheet pans work ok, but baking stones are much better, as they help transfer heat evenly to the bread more efficiently when preheated properly. A pizza peel will also come in very handy for getting the bread in and out of the oven. I also recommend a spray bottle full of water. You can spray the sides of the oven a few times during the first five minutes of baking to simulate steam injection. Another way of to simulate steam injection is to keep a pan of water on the bottom rack of the oven. The dough will need to be ""slashed"" to relieve the surface tension of the dough and prevent it from bursting when it completes its final rise in the oven.
 
*Cool* – Now we cool the bread. Although tempting, a good quality bread should never really be eaten warm. The heat will actually disguise the flavorful nuances of the bread caused by the fermentation. It's actually the same reason why bad quality bread tastes better when it's warm. Olive Garden breadsticks, anyone?

*Store/Eat* – So, now you can store it or eat it. Hopefully you'll eat it, since you worked so hard!

It can be (and has been) argued that some of these steps are so close together that they can be combined into one step. Some have learned this process as the ten steps of baking. But, this is how I learned it, and honestly it's the same whether you call it ten or twelve.

**Edit:** Some were unclear on the Mixing step and thought that I forgot kneading. Kneading is the same as development and is required to develop gluten. It is done on a higher speed than incorporation, usually speed two or three on most home mixers. Hope this clarifies some things."	t5_2s8h0	True

I created a handout for people to take home and included in it was some information on wheat and flour. This information was taken from certain sources (as noted) and I thought I would share. It's not a comprehensive guide, but hopefully can give some insight

**Wheat Flour**
	
*The Wheat Kernel* – courtesy of the Montana Wheat and Barley Committee

* Bran - About 14% of the kernel weight. The bran is included in whole wheat flour and is also available separately. The bran contains a small amount of protein, large quantities of the three major B vitamins, trace minerals and dietary fiber -- primarily insoluble. 
* Endosperm - About 83% of the kernel weight and the source of white flour. The endosperm contains the greatest share of protein, carbohydrates and iron, as well as the major B-vitamins such as riboflavin, niacin, thiamin and iron. It is also a source of soluble fiber.
* Germ - About 2.5% of the kernel weight. The germ is the embryo or sprouting section of the seed, often separated from flour in milling because the fat content (10 percent) limits shelf life. The germ contains minimal quantities of high quality protein and a greater share of B-complex vitamins and trace minerals. Wheat germ can be purchased separately and is included in whole wheat flour.

*Wheat Classes*

* Hard Red Winter Wheat -  The dominant class in U.S. exports and the largest class produced each year. Produced in the Great Plains states, extending from the Mississippi River west to the Rocky Mountains and from Canada to Mexico. Wide range of protein content, good milling and baking characteristics. Used to produce bread, rolls and, to a lesser extent, sweet goods and all-purpose flour. Major foreign buyers include Russia, China, Japan, Morocco and Poland.
* Hard Red Spring Wheat -  Contains the highest percentage of protein, making it an excellent bread wheat with superior milling and baking characteristics. Majority of crop is grown in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota. Exported largely to Central America, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and Russia.
* Soft Red Winter Wheat -  Grown primarily east of the Mississippi River. High yielding, but relatively low protein. Used for flat breads, cakes, pastries, and crackers. Largest customers are China, Egypt and Morocco.
* Hard White Wheat -  The newest class of wheat to be grown in the United States. Closely related to red wheats (except for color genes), this wheat has a milder, sweeter flavor, equal fiber and similar milling and baking properties. Used mainly in yeast breads, hard rolls, bulgur, tortillas and oriental noodles. Used primarily in domestic markets, although it is exported in limited quantities.
* Soft White Wheat -  Used in much the same way as Soft Red Winter (for bakery products other than bread). Grown mainly in the Pacific Northwest and to a lesser extent in California, Michigan, Wisconsin and New York. Low protein, but high yielding. Produces flour for baking cakes, crackers, cookies, pastries, quick breads, muffins and snack foods. Exported to Far East Asian region.
* Durum -  The hardest of all U.S. wheat and consistently the class with the lowest export volume, accounting for less than 5 percent of all U.S. wheat exports. Grown in the same northern states as Hard Red Spring, although 70 to 80 percent of the U.S. annual production comes from North Dakota. Used to make semolina flour for pasta production. The largest importer is Algeria.

*Milling Process* – courtesy of How Baking Works, Paula Figoni

Milling wheat has two purposes. One is to separate the endosperm from the bran and germ. The second is to grind the endosperm as finely as possible without damaging the starch granule. Once the endosperm is finely ground, it is classified in three different ways.

* Straight Flour – Combines all usable parts of the endosperm including trace amounts of bran and germ. This flour is not often used in the American baking industry, though some bakeries in France use it in breads.
* Clear Flour – The lowest grade of flour from the endosperm. Very high in protein content and ash content, though not high in gluten forming proteins. Has a gray color and is often used to strengthen whole grain or rye breads.
* Patent Flour – Most common of flours on the market. Uses the inner most part of the endosperm resulting in the highest quality. Contains very little bran and ash content. The following flours are considered patent flours:

1. Bread Flour – Made from hard red spring or winter wheats. Contains 11-13% protein content, most suitable for high volume bread production.
2. Hi-gluten Flour – Generally comes from hard red winter wheats. Contains 13-15% protein, often used to strengthen breads lacking gluten forming proteins.
3. Artisan Bread Flour – Relatively new on the market, made from hard red spring wheats, has a lower protein content than bread flour, and is often blended to resemble French wheat flours, which are typically not as strong as American flour. Less protein results in crisper crusts, and large, irregular holes. Although it contains less protein, the protein is of higher quality (produces more gluten).
4. All-Purpose Flour – AP flour varies from brand to brand. Often made with a blend of hard and soft wheats, and containing a protein content between 9 - 13%, AP flour can be used for a variety of products. 
5. Pastry Flour – Made from soft red winter wheat. Has a low protein content between 7-9%, and a high starch content. Higher starch means a more tender product, which is necessary for cookies, muffins, scones, etc.
6. Cake Flour – Treated with chlorine and hydrogen peroxide to change the physical make up of the flour. This is essential to break down starches so they are able to absorb more moisture, which is necessary in hi-ratio cakes.

*Aging Process* - courtesy of How Baking Works, Paula Figoni

After Flour is milled, it is considered “green” flour. Green flour needs to age so that the proteins can oxidize. This helps to create a stronger gluten structure, and makes the dough less sticky and fragile when mixing. There are two ways to age flour:

* Natural Aging – The flour sits around for a few weeks to a month. Pretty easy. However, it takes up space, can be inconsistent, and can be susceptible to pests. 
* Chemical Aging - “Maturing agents” are used to speed up the aging process. Some maturing agents strengthen, and others weaken the protein structure. Weakening is necessary for pastry and cake flours. Common maturing agents include chlorine, potassium bromate, and hydrogen peroxide.

**Questions about ingredients**

* What kind of flour should I use
* What kind of yeast is there, what are the differences
* How do bakers percentages work
* ....

**Dough Issues**

* My dough is too sticky. Halp.
* Should I mix by machine or hand? How long?  What are the differences
* What can I add to make my bread better/softer
* At what hydration should I bake?
* ...


Other categories could include FAQ's about sourdoughs, preferments, proofing, shaping, baking, etc.

1338249525.0	u9h0z	Hey Breadit, can we work together and build an awesome sidebar info box?	gaia12	40	3	8	"I think I speak for everyone when i say that searching online for suitable recipes and information on bread making can be extremely difficult. Personal stories, pictures, and the opportunity to ask questions is the way we like it. Often you see people asking others for recipes on this sub, and everyone has their favorite recipes for their best loaf. 

Why don't we build a google doc or simple sidebar links to great websites, information, and recipes regarding bread making? If we do a google doc, we could include posts that go with the recipe, and the opportunity for others to add their own personal comments or post their attempts when they try the recipe out.

We could include general info as well, such as creating a good sourdough starter, kneading techniques, etc.

Basically, i feel breadit deserves a great sidebar that everyone can participate in to make this subreddit the one stop shop to learn and show off your bread making!

P.S Pardon me asking for something and not contributing, but to be honest I am extremely new to baking and don't feel like I should be trusted with such a task.

Since /u/blatantcharmer was our winner, they chose this weeks. **Bread with Fruit!**

You may be thinking ""what?"" but that's part of the fun. /u/blatantcharmer thought ""Lets make some bread with fruit. Could be as simple as raisin bread, or include stranger things like grilled pineapple or apple sauce, or whatever. Fruit is intended to be interpreted liberally, including tomatoes or lemons. Pairing is encouraged.""*see links for suggestions*


**Rules:**

* Keep your posts for the challenge within this thread. As supportive as the Breadit community has been, we don’t want to spam the rest of the sub. :)

* Post a photo of your bread! Whether it’s a failure or a success, post it. You never know who can help you figure out something you’ve done wrong, or if you will be able to help someone out yourself. 

* Post the recipe you used, a link to the recipe you used/were inspired by, or just let us know you came up with it on your own and give a rough estimate of the details. 

* Post a summary of your technique. This can help others learn, and it can help others to help you! 

* Use whatever you like. If you want to try a gluten free version, go for it! Make the bread the way you’ll enjoy it. After all, we can’t help you eat it :)




**Please have submissions in by Monday, May 6.**

*If you would like a longer window, please tell me! I'm still trying to figure out the time frame.*


For those who would like a little direction, here are some recipes.

WHEAT BELONGS TO the family of grasses
and comes in a variety of different species:
types of wheat can be differentitated by sowing
time (spring or winter), color (red, white,
amber), and hardness.

The most important characteristics of wheat
for a baker is hardness: harder wheats contain
more protein than their softer siblings. Two of
the proteins—glutelin and gliadin—wich
account for 80 % of the protein in wheat flour
form gluten when they get in contact with
water.

Bakers often speak of gluten strength when
talking about the baking properties of different
flours (with equal protein quantities): flours with
stronger gluten lead to a dough that can be
kneaded longer and create better elasticity,
leading to a bread that retains its shape better
when it's resting than a weaker flour.

WHEN BUYING FLOUR from the grocery store,
depending on where you live, you will find a
range of different flours, made of different
wheats for different intended usages.
Bread flour is white flour made of hard,
high-protein wheat. The protein percentage
can be as high as 14 but usually stays
somewhere around 12 or 13. This is a good
choice for yeasted breads, especially if you
use a bakery mixer, but can be too strong for
slowly leavened sourdough loaves worked by
hand.

A softer alternative is all-purpose flour,
which is a mixture of hard and soft wheat
varieties, with a protein level of 8 to 11 %. This,
on the other hand can be too weak for a good
loaf of bread. In her book, Bread Science,
Emily Buehler recommends a level of about
11.5 %—the protein level of the French ""type
55"" bread flour—to get the best gluten
structure for white bread.

Experiment with the different flours until you
find one that works for you and the recipes you
use. Also, keep experimenting with the amount
of water you use. Flours with more gluten
forming proteins benefit from more water. As
you experiment, you will notice that your
favorite flour in the end might not be what you'd
expect at first. For example, although I'm a big
fan of organic food, my favorite white flour here
in Finland is not organic or fancy in any way—it
just leads to the most consistent results, so I'm
sticking to it until I find an organic flour that
does the same for me.

FRESHLY MILLED WHEAT FLOUR is light
yellow and the gluten in it is still quite weak.
When the flour is allowed to rest and age for six
weeks or more and the flour reacts with oxigen,
it turns white and the gluten forming proteins
gain more strength.

This process takes quite a bit of time, so
many flour manufacturers are eager to hurry it
up. To get the same results quicker, they use a
bleachening agent such as peroxide (benzoyl
peroxide) or chlorine oxide. This leads to a
flour that has the same baking qualities as a
naturally whitened flour but faster.

As this process can also leave unwantedside effects to the flour, most bakers will recommend using unbleached flour whenever
possible. And naturally, it's always a good idea
to go for a flour with as little additives as
possible.

A GRAIN OF WHEAT is composed of three
layers: the bran, the germ, and the endosperm.
When making white flour, all except the
endosperm is discarded. As this process
wastes such a big part of the grain, it used to
be a special treat only available to the richest
people of the time, and therefore considered
the healthier choice everyone should strive for
if possible.

Nowadays, white wheat flour is available to
everyone, but at the same time, wholegrain
flour is gaining in recognition as the healthier—
and more flavorful choice: in theory (although,
as we will soon see, things are not always this
clear cut), it contains all of the vitamins (B1, B6,
A, E), minerals and fats of the grain, as well as
the bran that helps your body in digesting the
bread.

These good properties come at a cost:
making a beautiful, airy loaf of bread from fullgrain
flour is much harder than doing it with
white flour. Luckily, although a wholegraiin
dough will always be denser than its white
counterpart, with practice and a couple of
tricks, it's possible to create a good wholegrain
bread that doesn't look and taste like a brick.

JUST LIKE MOST WHITE FLOUR, most of the
wholegrain flour sold in stores is roller milled. In
roller milling, the bran and germ are removed
from the grain before the rest of the grain is
ground. After the grinding, depending on the
extraction level of the flour being made, some
or all of the bran is added back in the flour. The
germ, because of its high fat content, will go
rancid quickly, so it's left out—and with it, a big
part of what makes wholegrain flour healthy!
STONE MILLING WORKS works the opposite
way: the whole grain is ground between a pair
of stones, and only then, some of the bran is
sifted out as desired—but with the germ
included. This is why stone ground flour is
probably healthier and more flavorful than roller
milled flour.

Because stone ground flour contains the
germ, you should use it while it's still fresh,
within a couple of weeks from milling, or store it
in a cool place such as your refrigerator.
The oxidation period is long enough to lose
most of the minerals and vitamins from the
flour. For example all of vitamin E disappears
from fresh flour in just one day from grinding.
For white flour—which doesn't have much of
the goods left in it anyway—this doesn't matter
much (and in most cases, aged flour is the way
to go), but if you want to get the health benefits
from wholegrain, buying fresh flour from a
nearby mill or milling your own flour are the
only options.

I bake big 2.5lbs loaves every week (or every two days when family visit) and I noticed that while the crust is nice and crunchy after baking it goes soft in the morning. Yesterday I realised it is caused by the steam that is generated inside the bread during the cooling process. My solution - I let the bread cool upside down - the crust was perfect this morning - all the steam escaped through the bottom. 
Also I learned that when it comes to baking stones thicker doesn't mean better - it's taking ages to warm up and doesn't allow the bottom of the bread to carmelise properly as if shielding it from the heat. "	t5_2s8h0	True

And can anyone recommend a recipe for a rustic bread that will provide one?	adremeaux	34	7	35	"Is a dark brown crust a result of a long and/or hot baking session, or does it come good steam? When I eat out, they often provide bread that has a very well developed, thick, chewy, crispy crust, and I haven't come even close in my home baking, even if the bread has overall been good.

I've been working through the ""rustic"" recipes in The Bread Bakers Apprentice, including Ciabatta and French Bread. Neither of them had a particularly long baking period, and it's difficult to tell from the pictures what the expected outcome is, so I'm not sure if I'm on target or not.

Ingredients:

* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 Tbsp. sugar
* 1 Tbsp. baking powder
* 1 tsp. salt
* 2 Tbsp. honey or agave nectar
* 1 bottle (12 ounces) beer
* 4 Tbsp. (half stick) butter, melted (**You can double this if you’d like**)

**Method:**

(Makes 1 loaf)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9x 5x 3-inch loaf pan.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Using a wooden spoon, stir the beer and honey into the dry ingredients until just mixed. (I recommend popping your honey in the microwave for a few seconds beforehand to make it easier to stir in)

Pour half the melted butter into the loaf pan. Then spoon the batter into the pan, and pour the rest of the butter on top of the batter. (Use a pastry brush to spread it around if you’d like.)

Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until top is golden brown and a toothpick/knife inserted in the middle comes out clean.

**Rules:**

* Keep your posts for the challenge within this thread. As supportive as the Breadit community has been, we don’t want to spam the rest of the sub. :)

* Post a photo of your bread! Whether it’s a failure or a success, post it. You never know who can help you figure out something you’ve done wrong, or if you will be able to help someone out yourself. 

* Post the recipe you used, a link to the recipe you used/were inspired by, or just let us know you came up with it on your own and give a rough estimate of the details. 

* Post a summary of your technique. This can help others learn, and it can help others to help you! 

* Use whatever you like. If you want to try a gluten free version, go for it! Make the bread the way you’ll enjoy it. After all, we can’t help you eat it :)




**Please have submissions in by Sunday, April 14.**

*If you would like a longer window, please tell me! I'm still trying to figure out the time frame.*


For those who would like a little direction, here are some recipes.

We have a great customer that is interested in a sweet potato bun after eating this in New Orleans: http://www.painperdublog.com/2011/01/sweet-potato-brioche.htm

They don't necessarily want to pay for the cost of a brioche and I have some reservations about the labor involved using fresh sweet potato. We have a great hamburger bun that is sweet that I think it could incorporate into.

* 1 cup lowfat yogurt and low fat milk (50/50)

1373761334.0	1i8wpw	[Question] Why are all bread websites obsessed with sour dough?	laharah	28	5	10	"So I'm a beginner bread maker, I've done maybe 4-5 loaves. I'm interested in branching out and making different breads, but everywhere I look, including breadit, all I seem to see is sour dough. 

I'm wondering if it's just a misunderstanding. To me, sour dough is literally that: a loaf of bread that has that familiar ""sour"" taste. You can get it at restaurants or at bakeries. I enjoy it on occasion, but it's just one small subset of bread flavor to me.

I just feel like I've been taking crazy pills. In my bread-consumer experience sour-dough is a tiny subset of bread, but while looking around online in the bread-making world it seems like sourdough accounts for like 85% of all bread ever made.

Is it simply that sour-dough is the most challenging type of bread to make, so it's over-represented in the online discussion? Does the entire world love and eat more sourdough than I've ever believed possible? Does sour dough simply refer to bread made with a home-made starter? Do all sourdoughs have that same basic sour flavor to different degrees?

Please help me out breadit, because I'm very confused.

***Edit:*** *thank* you for the replies they explained a lot! It seems that I simply misunderstood what the term was referring to. My sanity is intact!"	t5_2s8h0	True

Here's what I do.  At a garage sale, I purchased an old aluminium pie pan (it's actually heavy, it might be stainless steel).  I drilled the smallest hole I could in the middle of the pan.

To inject steam, I place the pan on the lowest rack (I have a solid floor gas oven, if you don't you might want an old sheet pan below the pie pan).  While the oven is pre-heating I boil a kettle of water.  Pour the water into the pie pan just after I put in the bread.

Getting the right volume of water took a try or two.  You don't want to fill the pan, 1/4 to 1/2 inch is enough.  The water not only bubbles in the pan, but drips out the hole onto the hot bottom of the oven.  Here we get more steam.

Using this method I can keep a really thick head of steam built up in the oven for the first 10 minutes or so of cooking."	t5_2s8h0	True

I am so surprised how well it turned out for being so simple. I made the dough yesterday and let it rise for about 20 hours, and then another two after folding it twice. 

My question is what could I do to get the inside a little less chewy and moist? I guess it's quite glutinous? I don't have a good mixer so anything I do has to either be no-knead or hand kneaded (which sounds messy and difficult, but maybe someone has some advice).

I can't wait to start trying variations on this and then hopefully onto something more challenging.

Essentially, my wife wants ""wonder"" bread.  White (or wheat) fluffy bread like you can buy in the store.  

That question brought a lot of good suggestions, which I have been dutifully exploring.  Of all the suggestions I've tried, [this recipe](http://www.food.com/recipe/soft-as-wonder-white-bread-154576) has been the most tasty. 

However...this bread is crumbly.  The cohesiveness of individual slices is not good.  It is certainly nothing like what you get out of store-bought.  It isn't close to what I can get in my typical breads either.  I tried kneading it for longer (I use the Kitchen-Aid attachment), but that didn't help.  I was thinking about adding eggs, because my egg-based breads usually come out much more cohesive.
