While so many of you are talented, have great ideas, etc, there is one specific trait that stands out in meetings and it's the sketching on sketching/vellum paper that occurs during our meetings. There are two types of architects when it comes to meetings, note takers and sketchers. Us developers prefer the latter almost 100%.  Don't just sit there and write down words, tear off those sheets and start working the discussion into drawings. It works so much better and we see your/our ideas come to life.  And when the next iteration of the drawings gets back to us and you rarely forget elements of the previous discussion.  It always works better, trust me. Be the sketcher."	t5_2qhae	True

1375669633.0	1jprwf	A present for /r/architecture	PostPostModernism	96	5	49	"Hello /r/Architecture!  I was going through some files, transferring stuff to a new laptop, when I came across something I thought you might like.  I tended to save everything I received back in college when it came to things like books, writings, etc.  In this case, I found a large collection of writings, interviews, manifestos, etc. from several of my classes.  These cover a lot of topics from general architectural history, Chicago architectural history (that was where I went to school, so it was a big topic in my classes) to a class based on the examination of materials in architecture.  I would like to offer these as an educational resource and potential conversation starter to spice things up in this subreddit.

Over the last couple weeks, I put together a table of contents, listing out all of the PDFs I am willing to share with you guys.  It can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjwESGxfLkaOdE1WY0RQSUppQmF2WVozcF90WWFxRVE&amp;usp=sharing) in google doc format.  Feel free to take a look at the list at your pleasure.  

That brings me to my next point - what should I do with all of this wonderfully educational material?  The way I see it, there are a few options:  

**1st** - I could just put everything together, available for download, do with it as you please, end of story.  

**2nd-** I could maybe do a more structured release where over time, I will release some related pdfs, and the next week we could discuss them as a group.  I'm not sure how long we could stretch this out for, but most importantly, I'm not going to take the time to do this if people aren't interested.  

**3rd** - I could not release them generally, and just respond to individual requests for files as you like.  Want something or several things?  PM your email and I can send it to you when I get a chance.  This option will be available regardless of what we do, I would be happy to oblige anyone who wants to learn.  

So what do I need from you?  First off - vote in the comments below.  I can do 1 or more of the 3 options as people would like, but only if people would like.  Secondly, I will need some advice on what is the best way to go about distributing these.  I've never done something like this before, and am not sure what the best file distribution site would be for this sort of stuff.  

For a disclaimer - I don't claim ownership of any of this material.  I am distributing this material for educational purposes, and if the owner of any of these articles would not like their work distributed, I would be happy to comply to any requests.  "	t5_2qhae	True

1375915127.0	1jwzmm	A free tool for /r/architecture users	architypedotorg	92	20	20	"Hello /r/architecture community!


I am a web developer for an up-and-coming site called [Architype](http://architype.org/), which offers free project hosting to architecture firms and students alike.  We offer you, as an Architype user, the ability to create a firm or architect page for yourself, showcase your projects or designs on their own, unique page, and hopefully gain some exposure in the world of architecture.


In addition to hosting projects from nearly anyone, we seek to honor those projects that are challenging the limits and redefining the norms of certain building types by publishing them in [Architype Review](http://architype.org/issues/), our online publication which currently runs an issue every other month.  In other words, if your projects catch our eye here at Architype Review HQ, we'll feature them (and you) in our distinguished-but-still-free ezine.  You can check out the subject of each future issue [here](http://architype.org/about/editorial-calendar/).


Architype was created as a means through which to advance the discussion of design within specific building typologies and explore the influence that type has on the design process.  Acting as a comprehensive database of innovative projects delineated by building typologies, Architype is a leading research tool that features architect firm listings and profiles, material libraries and additional resources such as the latest industry news and job postings for the architecture and design community.


As an /r/architecture reader myself, my goal is to partner with this subreddit in order to provide its users with an easy means for gaining exposure and really place this subreddit's users in the forefront of modern architectural innovation.  I hope you all enjoy this tool and get a lot of use out of it!  If you have any specific questions, concerns, comments, etc., leave me a comment.  I'll be replying to all of them!"	t5_2qhae	True

1332255368.0	r54ld	Would you be interested in a little reddit architecture/urban design/urban planning/landscape architecture design challenge/competition?	flobin	86	17	36	"This is an idea I got last night as I went to bed. I figured it might be fun to do a little reddit architecture/urban design/urban planning/landscape architecture design challenge/competition. We all love looking at work other redditors have done, so this seemed like a fun idea to me.

The idea is that there would be a certain design problem, which would be pretty broad so that several subreddits could tackle it. There’d be a certain timeframe and some loose submission guidelines. Then we could all vote on submissions and there could be a winner, perhaps judged by upvotes (though I don’t know if we even really need a winner per se). Perhaps we could do a ‘best overall’ and ‘best from r/..’ for each subreddit.

How do you like that idea?

The design challenge I came up with was:  
**How would you make (the streets of) Tokyo more green?**  
I figured this was broad enough for submissions from /r/architecture, /r/urbandesign, /r/urbanplanning and /r/landscapearchitecture—so that we wouldn’t end up with only 3 submissions. But of course maybe you guys have a better idea.

The timeframe I was thinking of would be **2 weeks**, since I don’t think it should be anything too serious, while still allowing people for enough time to come up with something cool.

The guideline for submissions I had in mind would be: 
 
* 1 A4-sized pdf, portrait
* 2 A4-sized pdfs, portrait
* 1 A3-sized pdf, landscape
* A jpg (or maybe png) of the same size at (at least) 150DPI

The reason for using ISO 216 would be that I don’t think there is a US paper size that’s exactly double the ‘letter’ size, so it allows for a bit more flexibility. I figured I’d make a template pdf with a little title bar where you could fill out your reddit username and titles and then at the end I could combine them all to make a little booklet that you could print or look at online.

Perhaps we could hijack /r/design_challenges for submissions or just create a new thread here, or maybe even a new subreddit.

After an 8-week remodel, what do you think? 	benjaminkahlemusic	87	14	60	"This home was built in 1928 and is located in the ""View Park"" area of LA. From what I understand, all of the wood, hand-carved doors, iron, chandeliers, sconces, light switch covers, doorhandles, sinks, tubs, subway tiles and bathtub handles are from the 1920s. We restored everything to the best of our ability. The interior of the house was also repainted, re-piped with copper plumbing, the kitchen &amp; laundry area re-tiled and the electrical updated. There's still work to do, but we're proud of our first home! Here's the gallery - http://imgur.com/a/iKAxe

Fergi	69	8	46	"Hey, I was inspired by a previous thread about IIT's Crown Hall and it got me thinking about how much the space we work in matters to us as designers. 

I'm at the University of Texas at Austin and [this is my studio this semester](http://i.imgur.com/o5Hc4cm.jpg).  It is in [Sutton Hall](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Sutton_Hall_UT.JPG), designed by [Cass Gilbert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cass_Gilbert) and completed in 1918. It's the third oldest building on our (relatively young) campus.

Great questions and great answers and opinions. What we don't have is a resource to access these in the sidebar. Some of the older AMA's by Architects are some of the best materials I've read.

I think it would be great to boost the sidebar with content that makes this subreddit great instead of linking to a bunch of other generic ones.

Things we could include:

* Recommended Books

* Recommended Documentaries, Interviews and films.

* Our favorite blogs

* Resources for CG and CAD e.g. libraries
* Details about upcoming competitions
* Simple direction and advice for those interested in Architecture.
* Perhaps even a flair for each university or if you're part of a practice

There seem to be many generic design sub-reddits with some tailored for more pictures of Architecture, Landscapes and Interiors rather the discussion of it. Perhaps with a bit of work, we could make this subreddit a better resource for all.

A few of her toys were in it, and a square tile had been placed over the basket, to protect them from the weather. An acanthus plant had grown through the woven basket, mixing its spiny, deeply cut leaves with the weave of the basket

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/The_Origin_of_the_Corinthian_Order%2C_engraving.jpg

edit* some comments have pointed out that egyptians also had indigenous plants on their pillar capitals - you are correct! - the Corinthian guy must have been inspired by them (as he clearly was by the tuscan, doric, and ionic capitals)  - also, this could explain why there were some deco capitals that had plants extending all the way to the top (art deco was prevalent around the time there was a shhhitload of excavating going on in egypt)

anyways, check this out, it has a super comprehensive breakdown of tuscan, doric, ionic, corinthian and composite...and it has a little picture of the basket on the left side of the corinthian section ;)
