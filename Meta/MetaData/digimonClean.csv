You know, we've been a community for a very long time, and we've just recently passed over 800 subscribers! That's really amazing!... but, the moderation team has decided that we should really just give up.

I mean, let's think about this rationally. Virtually everybody you know of has heard of Pokemon. Even your grandma is smart enough to call a pokemon a ""Pikachu"" (even if that's not its proper name). Who the hell knows what an Agumon is? 

* Let's face it, Pokemon has the better games. Do I need to remind you about Digimon World 2?
* It's pretty annoying to add -mon to the end of every single creature in the Digimon universe. Pokemon got it right: There's no Pikachu-mon.
* And do I really need to say anything about [this](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100118025818/digimon/images/e/e4/Fusionevolution.jpg)?

We're really excited for this change, and we know you are, too. Henceforth, all Digimon-related content is forbidden, and should go to [the appropriate place](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon).

I posted on the DS game maker forums for testing, but the forums there are pretty dead. I just want people to try it out and give me some feedback. It's pretty much a fakemon game I guess but ~~I made it from scratch~~ made the gameplay myself and  used sprites from the internet. I hope it's enjoyable. If not just say it isn't and I won't have any hard feelings. I just wanted a casual game for people who like digimon. There might be a glitch or two so let me know. You can play it on no$gba but I don't know if the save function works. It does work on the DS with a flash card.

You can grab it on dsgamemaker.com/dsgmforum/index.php
under the finished projects category. 

I'm figure it's not good enough to be considered for the indie gaming subreddit, but since you guys like digimon I figure you guys must be pretty cool. And try out the other games there since I'm sure those people worked hard on their games too!

Edit: Fixed the Imperialdramon sprite and the Wargrowlmon sprite. If you have guilmon as a starter you end up having a Meramon sprite instead of Wargrowlmon sorry. I'll update the download after a few more edits.

Let me know what you guys think should be changed about it too!
Thanks!

**New update out**: There was a problem where digimon didn't digivolve. The updated version should fix the problem.

**Update**: Increased difficulty on bosses. Chronomon is now available

**Update**:Fixed a bug where you can't fight the boss in crystal caves plus teleporting to computer with the Y button"	t5_2rxw7	True

This angers me.	burek_japrak	63	14	75	"I have been playing the Pokemon games since Red/Blue, and those games are fucking awesome. And as we all sorta know the Pokemon anime is really sub-par compared to the Digimon anime. The games however, are mediocre at best. The best Digimon games imho are Digimon World 1 and 3 mainly because they resemble the Pokemon vidyas and, let's face it, nostalgia has a lot to do with the quality of those games.

We need a good MMORPG based game where you get your own starter 'mon and you train it (cue the 80s's montage), with a battle system similar to Rumble Arena (that game had potential, I'm just sad the Digimon and moveset roster was VERY limited). Or something completely different. I dunno. Just don't fucking mention Digimon Masters Online that game wasted 2 months of my life and it fucking sucks that you have to grind and grind and shit blood for a fuckign digiegg ajsgdjhasdg

1350109444.0	11em6f	Introducing the /r/digimon Community Watch Party	Enforte	47	8	21	"Hey there, DigiDestined:

For the past few months, we've been talking about getting our reddit to come together and experience Digimon again: we'd watch it together, discuss it together, and relive our childhoods together, potentially introducing today's generation to our fandom.

Beginning in November, /r/digimon will be hosting its first ever Community Watch Party! We've been debating the best way to do this, and we think that we've come up with an excellent way to make sure that everyone can stay involved without having to be at a certain place at a certain time.

At the beginning of each week, we'll be posting a thread for that week's ""assignment."" Each week, you'll be asked to watch six episodes of Digimon, and then come back to discuss it. In this way, those of us with a busy schedule can watch one thirty-minute episode when we have a bit of free time, and those of us with more liberal schedules will be able to watch them all at once. (Of course, there's nothing stopping you from skipping ahead - just make sure that you're ready to talk about them when the time comes!)

*You can watch whichever localization of Digimon that you're most comfortable with.*

We're really looking forward to seeing what comes from this! Look for a thread on November 4 for Episodes 1 - 6 of Digimon Adventure! Sit down, relax, bring a friend and some popcorn, and get ready to open the Digiport!

What bothers me about this is that, all things considered, he's actually very powerful, so much so that he could have completely overshadowed the other DNA Digivolutions had Imperialdramon not shown up shortly after.

First of all, Shakkoumon has the ability to absorb *any* energy attack sent his way. BlackWarGreymon's Terra Destroyer? Nope. Daemon's Evil Inferno? Nuh-uh. MaloMyotismon's Crimson Mist, which *killed Arukenimon in a single hit?* Didn't even *scratch* Shakkoumon.

He's also able to dish out a fair bit of damage, too. When he appeared, he was able to heavily damage BlackWarGreymon, whom had previously kicked the combined asses of both Paildramon and Sylphimon.

I suppose it's understandable that you might find his appearance a bit silly, but to me that just makes it even more awesome that he's able to kick so much ass.

The idea goes like this: the ""mon"" suffix attached to each Digimon actually makes a great deal of sense in a digitally-based world. It could be interpreted as a file extension of sorts, in that all Digimon are of a ""monster file"" which could be represented digitally as "".mon"" if you will. So ""Gatomon"" could be read digitally as ""Gato.mon"" as a code, and therefore she interprets that as her name.

Similarly, names could call for shortened keywords. For instance, ""Seadramon"" is a sea dragon, so his file name would be ""Seadra.mon""--a file name that has been shortened.

Then of course there is digivolution where as data is absorbed and the files grow, new data causes for a new name for the file and the digital iterations of the file could call for underscores. So an example would be ""Metalseadramon"" being digitally represented as ""Metal_seadra.mon"" Or ""Wargreymon"" as ""war_grey.mon.""

This could even be taken one step further in that the regional origin of the data that comprises the Digimon could factor into the Digimon's ""file name""; for instance, ""Seadramon"" appears very English in its name, so maybe its data mostly originated from English speaking countries. Gatomon's name is mostly Spanish in nature, so its data may have mostly originated in a Spanish country; Agumon, Japanese; etc.

The implications from here could be taken in any sort of manner; higher level forces at play in the digital world that could understand and manipulate the digital code could lack the .mon suffix and have a more general name or another suffix, such as .syst for ""system"" or something similar. Or even look at [Yggdrasill](http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/Yggdrasill) who makes various appearances in Digimon media: he is regarded as the ""master computer"" that controls the Digital World and lacks the .mon suffix; perhaps because he is not a file but a higher level of unified code."	t5_2rxw7	True

PancakesAreLove	31	2	18	"Some of you may or may not have played the original Digimon World game but all I can say is that any Digimon fan should play it.  Now we have a chance for an upgraded version with megas, more Digimon, and a lot more Digimon to recruit(hopefully).  

Someone on Gamefaqs made a Facebook page and when it gets enough likes, he hopes to show it to Bandai so that they will see that it would be worth bringing it over seas.

Anyway, I'm a games programmer and I'd be happy to make some kind of digivice app for Android and WP7. I could also write a PC version, assuming you'd be interested. Anyway, my questions to you guys are the following:

1. What digimon would you like to see?
1. What season would you prefer to see it based on?
1. Would you want it to be based on the toy digivices?
1. Would you pay for it?
1. Would you be interested in a barcode scanner?
1. Would you like it to calculate when you walk as a step in the game?
1. How big would you want the map?
1. Would you mind adverts?
1. If no, what about an advert for the subreddit
1. How involving do you want the game to be

There's probably a bunch more I could add, so if you have any idea just reply or message me. In addition to that, if you would like to help out either by porting it to different language, making pretty pictures etc also message me.

Starting today, you can now select your own flair! And [this time](http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/ljjh6/user_flair_coming_soon_to_rdigimon/), it's here to stay! Thanks to [Jamesathan](http://www.reddit.com/user/Jamesathan), you can now select from multiple colors of the Season 2 and Season 3 Digivices, as well as Agumon, Gabumon, and the front and back of the Blue Card from Digimon Tamers! We're going to be working to add more, so please let us know [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/xq67b/rdigimon_needs_an_upgrade_we_need_flairs_of_our/) what type of flair you would like in the future! We won't always be making announcements about new flair that we add, so check back regularly!

Additionally, starting today, you can now mark your posts as ""Spoilers."" After you submit your post, select the ""flair"" option beside ""nsfw."" (You can also select ""Meta"" for /r/digimon-related posts, and we have ""Update"" for updates from the moderators. I'm not positive how to make that mod-only at the moment, so [please let me know](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=enforte) if you do!)

Finally, we've officially hit 2,500 subscribers! When I started /r/digimon two years ago, I had no idea that it would get this large! I'd really like to thank our friends at /r/pokemon for helping with the annual April Fool's Day switcheroo, [Seismictoss](http://www.reddit.com/user/Seismictoss) and [Takuya813](http://www.reddit.com/user/Takuya813) for helping with moderation, and all of you for producing such great content!

Before I let you all go, I've noticed that there have been a lot of people interested in re-watching the series. Would there be enough interest to hold a community-wide rewatch? If so, let's try and get one set up, where we'll watch from the very beginning, and once a week, hold a discussion on the episodes we watched. We'll need a clever name for it, though, so be thinking of one!

Thanks again for everything, DigiDestined! I can't wait to see what else we can do together!

&lt;3,

The /r/digimon moderators

1328416408.0	pbhni	Re: Let's talk digivice apps! - A solid idea and recruitment 	greenpencil	33	5	30	Hello everyone me again. I decided to finally update you all as to whats going on with this little project of mine. If you're following me you would know that I've had issues with my code not compiling, everything is fixed now so don't worry. The_Ubertoast has been amazing and put together a rough idea of what you guys want. I'm going to base the world around the first series of digimon and on File Island. If there's the demand I'll also leave room for expansions throughout the series at no cost to you. The whole thing will be 100% free, however you're welcome to donate (this will allow you to modify the colors or something similar). It'll follow a similar approach to Pokemon, the world is a top down 2D game for everything outside of battles. The battles will be a action platformer, with each digimon having 4 moves (2 default ones, 2 special moves). You guys generally want a large map, but I decided it would be better to release expansions often instead so you don't get too bored with the same place. I will also release expansions which allow for battles across players via the internet. My plan is to create and release a PC version this will just take me less time) and use RAD (basically release, see what people like/dislike, and repeat). When people are happy with it I'll port it to any platforms you would like to see it on. Obviously this is going to be hard, so if you want to help awesome. I could do with someone writing a solid story (TheDWGM pointed this out), If you're interested feel free to PM me with some kind of outline and contact information. Any kind of pixel art would also be good, I know some people but I prefer it if fans do it rather than someone with no connection, if you're interested you can PM me with some kind of example and your contact information. Programmers familiar with mobile games or Java/C will be useful, just PM me your contact information. Sound would also be awesome, I'm not expecting anything major, some kind of battle music and ambiance. If you have any ideas or anything you have to contribute that would be cool. I should also mention that I can probably handle all the jobs on my own or with friends, so it will get done, but not as fast. 	t5_2rxw7	True

1336047668.0	t4z81	Does anyone just watch digimon for the nostalgia,whether its good or not	favsiteinthecitadel	39	13	9	"I recently went back to digimon, a franchise i watched as a kid and loved. Well, i should say i watched season 1 and 2. i honestly preferred it to pokemon at the time, despite its being an obivous rip off. i think its because it just felt more epic to me than pokemon ever did.
However, now i've gone back to it, i do enjoy it less, the character aren't as good as i remember, and the repetive nature of the show bugs me a bit. However, much like with the original pokemon, i still get nostalgic watching it, heck im even able to watch it dubbed, despite it being one of the worst dubs i've seen. 
I won't deny it has its good moments. i actually think season 2 is slightly better than season 1, in terms of characters and plot. But its not hard to see why a lot of people dismiss it.
HOWEVER, after season 1 and 2 , i watched tamers....and was blown away by how different it was and how much better it was. As a reboot of the franchise, its probably one of the best reboots out there. And its the first time, i've actually wanted to actually purchase it, but i doesn't seem to be available in the uk, which sucks.
So, in conclusion, i don't hate season 1 and 2, I just don't thnk it stands out as well, as it did when i was a kid. I still love it, but in a nostalgic way, not for its plot or characters. Tamers does pretty much everything better, and i honestly wish it had been the first season in the franchise. it just feels like it has more of an idenity, other than just being a pokemon rip off, and i think a lot of people wouldn't have dismissed it , if they had seen it"	t5_2rxw7	True

This year is Digimon's 15th anniversary. Digimon World Re:Digitize is releasing today in Japan. August 1st, the much celebrated date of when the Adventure children went to the Digital World, is approaching soon. Now is a great time to update as many people as we can on the status of Digimon and our fansites.

If you own a currently active site or old Digimon site that hasn't been updated in ages, do so right now! Tell us that you're just 'checking in' to update everyone, and you can link to these threads. Anyone searching through old Digimon communities can find these messages and see that the fandom as a whole is still very active, and Digimon is still going. You can link to [DMO](http://www.joymax.com/dmo/) and the [Re:Digitize Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/Digimon.World.Re.Digitize) page as well, to increase their traffic and show that english Digimon fans want more releases.

I'll be posting threads like these anywhere I can in the community, to find as many people as possible. I encourage webmasters to post in any of these threads they want to, leaving a message about who they are, what their site was all about, and what they're doing today in the Digimon fandom. You can give shout outs to old friends and any other messages you'd like to, as well. Any thread posted in will be linked to from every other thread which I can update, creating a network of them.

If you know any former webmasters, it would be a great help if you could point them here. If you're any fan in Digimon circles at DeviantArt, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or Tumblr, I encourage you to 'check in' there, too, and recommend others to do so also. Members of Digimon communities I can't post in, such as those in other languages, can organize similar 'check ins' as well.

Here are the biggest communities I'm posting this thread to, and I'll update the list with whatever other threads get replies:

I'm sure many of you have heard of DMO and have been itching to try it. A digimon MMO? How awesome does that sound?! Well, you will be sorely disappointed. It had a lot of potential but the greediness of the publisher, Joymax, has really tainted the game. It's free to play but without using the cash shop you won't get very far. Sure it's great at first but as soon as you want to start being ""good"" at this MMO, you're going to have a very difficult time.

I'll start with some good points first:

- **It's digimon.** Seriously, that's the only reason why people play this game. We're all just people wanting to play with and train our own digimon. Sadly it's lost that initial magic for me and I've seen what a horrible MMO it really is.

- **The Community is nice.** If you can find someone that speaks your language, they're pretty nice. Guild communities are good, very chatty and will usually lead to having friends outside the game. 

- **It's pretty.** You can see I'm struggling to find any good points here. But yes, the game looks nice. The models look great, the environments are nice, and you can edit a lot of the textures too. Some days it's nice just to hop on your digimon (...using a cash shop item) and ride through the digital world. 


-----Okay.. now for the bad------

- **The entire game is a grind fest.** Seriously, I'm not exaggerating. You will spend 99% of your play time slowly killing one digimon after another just to level up for only bragging rights and rankings.

- **All the ""quests"" are mind-numbingly boring.** Every single quest is either ""Talk to person A"", ""Defeat X amount of digimon"", ""Get X amount of items dropped from Digimon Y"" or ""Use item on Digimon Z"". That's... it. There is some sort of a story going on but you can tell there wasn't much care put into it. Maybe this [""cutscene""](http://i.imgur.com/gJlnOks.png) will show how much effort they put into it

- **It is extremely unfair to those who don't use cash.** This is mainly an issue when it comes to hatching new digimon. Allow me to explain; When hatching a digimon there are hatching phases. To add one phase to your egg you need to insert a certain amount of data (a random drop) for the corresponding type. When inserting the data there is a high chance that it will fail, eating up the data you used. To make things worse; on this fail there is a chance the egg will be completely destroyed and you'll need to get another one-- and these eggs are not easy to come by. Once you've reached phase 3 you'll be able to hatch a digimon. ...only problem is they will be tiny and very weak. If you don't want a tiny, weak digimon you can try to reach phases 4 or 5. Phase 4 giving you a normal sized and powered digimon, 5 giving you the biggest and strongest (but still has a random chance to hatch small anyway). It is near **impossible** to hatch a 5/5 digimon UNLESS you use cash. Cash eggs have a 100% chance of hatching at either phase 3, 4 or 5. So even when paying cash you might not get what you want. 

- **Everything is a gamble.** This is what I hate the most about this game. Like I said before, you can buy eggs from the cash shop and still only get a tiny, weak digimon. You can buy things called digiclones which you can use to make some of your digimon's stat's stronger (up to 12 times) but they have a very high fail rate from 5 times and up. And for more salt on the wound, when they fail there's a chance to make your digimon's stat go **down**. Still not convinced? Even the drops are a gamble. Digimon drop eggs (sometimes) when defeated which need to be scanned by an NPC (and cost in-game currency to do so) to find out what drop you got. It can be bread, clothes, data or absolutely nothing. This brings me to my next point.

- **The drop rate is level capped.** That's right, they have a drop rate cap. Unless there is a special event drop or something going on, only digimon within 5 or so levels from yours will actually drop any items. Which makes grinding for mercenary digi eggs (the eggs that can hatch into a digimon for you) is an absolute nightmare.

- **You need to pay cash to unlock digivolutions.** I'm not kidding, it's that ridiculous. You need to buy things called Evoluters to unlock the ultimate stages and above of your non-starter digimon. If you buy cash eggs there is a chance they'll already have some stages unlocked but using normal eggs they will never have any unlocked. Sometimes there are events where they give out evoluters but these are rare and they only give you about half of what you need so that you end up buying the rest. Even more annoyingly, the amount of evoluters needed varies from digimon to digimon. For ultimate you'll need anywhere between 3 and 5, and for mega you need anywhere between 6 and 9. Some digimon even have their burst modes, buuut you can only unlock those by buying a special item in the cash shop for them. This item is the price of about 8 evoluters.

- **There is no PvP.** Need I say more? There is no real reason to level up your digi other than feeling cool and going for level rankings. Oh but make sure you choose which digimon you want to level for rankings wisely, a few digimon don't even have a ranking page due to Joymax's stupid website.

- **There are bots freaking everywhere.** So. Many. Spam. Bots. Constantly shouting and whispering to you their stupid websites and other crap. You can also download botting programs from sites to grind and play for you. Botting is so blatantly obvious and easy to do that you'd think that the mods would ban them right away. Oh wait, **there are no mods.**

- **Barely anyone speaks English well.** Now I don't mean to be racist, but this is a serious problem. I need to be able to talk to others  in my party about the rate at which they're hunting, ask questions, answer questions and many other things. The majority of players are Indonesian, so if you can speak Indonesian you won't have much of a problem.  Most people know the word ""Party"" and that's it. When playing the English DMO, I expect the other players to understand English.

- **The EXP rate is horrific.** From level 1 to about 41 the EXP is fine, but from there on it stars to get very slow. Without any EXP boosters (gotten from events and the cash shop) it will be about one hour per level, half an hour if you've got a good party. After level 50 you'll only get a few levels per day and 70+ it's just ridiculous. The maximum level is 90 for digimon and 99 for tamers. Tamers level up about 4x slower that digimon. If you want to bring the EXP up to a normal, durable level you'll need to use cash for boosters. 

- **The ""abilities"" do nothing.** Now, after my last point I bet you're probably thinking ""Why not just attack multiple digimon at once?"". Well the problem with that is.. you can't. Sure you can have multiple digimon attacking you but you can only attack one digimon at a time. Every single ability does nothing but damage to one digimon. No effects, no statuses, no buffs, no AOEs, just damage to one digimon. Boooring.
 
- **Americans have an advantage.** When you buy the cash shop currency, called ""Silk"", there is normal silk and premium silk. Items bought with premium silk can be traded, and therefore sold. I've looked at the methods of buying PSilk and I've never heard of any of them. Why is this such an advantage? You'll see in my next point.

- **Player shops are ridiculously overpriced.** The in game currencies are bits, mega and terra. 1000B = 1M and 1,000,000M  = 1T. With 1T you are considered rich, it's not very easy to get to without selling cash items. To buy a 5/5 egg from a player,  you will be paying from about 40-50T, a figure impossible to get to without cash. In the Korean DMO, you'll never pay more than 12T for anything. In English DMO, 12T will get you a 4/5 digimon with no evolutions unlocked. This supports my other point about the game being unfair to non cashers.

In conclusion it's a fun little MMO at first but once the initial shine wears off you can see all the terrors that lie below. I urge you to try this game and see how far you can get without using cash before falling asleep.

If you have any questions feel free to ask, I don't bite. I hope that other DMO players can agree with my points, if not I'm open to discussion. 

Thanks for reading!

Today, we begin the first week of our Community Watch Party. For those of you who didn't see [the original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/11em6f/introducing_the_rdigimon_community_watch_party/), we're going to be watching every single episode of Digimon together - starting with the original series, Digimon Adventure - and discussing it!

Before we get started, though, I'd like to remind you of a few important things. First of all, you can watch any localization of Digimon that you'd like. Use this thread all week, and next Sunday we'll post a new thread for the next six episodes. Of course, you can go ahead and watch ahead, but we're only going to be discussing the first six this week. On that same note, **use spoiler tags if you are discussing ANYTHING from a future episode or season.** To use spoiler tags, use the method described in the sidebar. If you see a spoiler, report it, and we'll remove it.

Here's your assignment for the week:

episode | eng | jap
:--|:--|:--
1 | And so it begins... | Hyoryu? Boken no Shima!
2 | The Birth of Greymon | Bakuretsu Shinka! Gureimon
3 | Garurumon | Aoki Okami! Garurumon
4 | Biyomon Gets Firepower | Shakunetsu! Badoramon
5 | Kabuterimon's Electro Shocker | Denko! Kabuterimon
6 | Togemon in Toy Town | Parumon Ikari no Shinka

That started a fire in the room, so many people raised their hands to point out all sorts of cool, very creative details about the digimon tv show and games that have come out over the years. 
    Most of the discussions were about Digimon, the panel ended up being chill for the most part, besides occasional small arguments. I was just happy to finally attend a digimon panel at a con.

I was a kid when Adventure 1 &amp; 2 were still on TV and I was much more into Digimon than Pokemon at the time (they're almost an even ranking, though if I have to choose it would still be Digimon). I've noticed a few posts talking about rewatching/getting back into the anime so I have a few questions for you guys:

* I stopped watching Digimon at the end of Adventure 2 regularly, only catching a few episodes here and there of the later series. Should I watch them now as a 20 year old?

* Watching Adventure as a kid meant I watched the dub, something I learned is often a butchered version of the original through watching a few other anime, Should I rewatch it in Japanese or is there no point?

I should also mention that roughly a year ago I rewatched Adventure 1&amp;2 (dubbed) and played at least some of each of the games released for the DS in English so I definitely still enjoy Digimon in general"	t5_2rxw7	True

First of all, I'd like to announce the results of our [moderator search]( http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/sn61t/join_the_digimods_inquire_within/). After some careful deliberation between Seismic and I (that took twenty-one days), we've decided to add [Takuya813](http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/user/Takuya813) to our ranks! We'd also like to thank everybody who applied - it was an incredibly tough decision, and we're going to give you guys special consideration the next time we're going to expand our moderator base.

Secondly - and this is my favorite bit of news - /r/digimon is officially on Freenode! We've got a channel at ##reddit-digimon that you can connect to with your favorite IRC program, or [through your web browser]( http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##reddit-digimon). You're welcome to log on any time and join in the digital discussions! (Server is irc.freenode.net, if you're not sure!)

I'd like to get a community meeting together at some point in the near future so that we can talk about the future of our little corner of reddit. I'd like to get us all together to work on a big project that'll really put us on the map. So, be thinking of ideas!

I expect to see all of you on IRC at some point - I think it'll be great to get to talk some in a more lively forum! And, as always, contact me (or any of our wonderful mods) if you have any questions whatsoever!

1359094439.0	178r6r	Just what IS the Digital Hazard? Here's my theory..	Zennistrad	21	2	6	"In Digimon Tamers, The Digital Hazard is a powerful force of destruction that exists within Guilmon, as signified by the symbol on his chest. When he digivolved into Megidramon, the Digital Hazard's full destructive potential was unleashed, threatening the very existence of the Digital World itself.

However, if you look closely at Takato's original drawing of Guilmon, you'll notice that the Digital Hazard symbol isn't there. The Digital Hazard was somehow incorporated into Guilmon during his creation.

But what exactly IS the Digital Hazard? How can a single Digimon display enough destructive power to threaten the Digital World itself by its mere existence?

I have a theory: the Digital Hazard is the real reason for the D-Reaper's destructive rampage.

The D-Reaper was created by the United States government as a defense program to keep the number of digital lifeforms in the Digital World in check, but why? The digital world didn't pose a significant threat to the real world at the time, why were they worried about it?

Well, it just so happens that the D-Reaper is based off of real-world history. [The ""Creeper"" Worm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creeper_virus) was an experimental self-replicating program that displayed a message, widely considered to be the origin of all computer viruses [(source)](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/oct/23/internet-history). The first anti-virus program was created in response, and it was called *The Reaper.*

My theory is that the Digital Hazard is based off of the Creeper, and that destroying it was the D-Reaper's true purpose. Unlike the Creeper, however, the Digital Hazard was truly malicious in its design: it infected the digital world and made Digimon destructive and violent. If left unchecked, the infected Digimon would reach the world's communications networks and bring about significant damage to them. In response, the United States Department of Defense created the D-Reaper to destroy infected Digimon and keep the remaining population in check so that they wouldn't be able to threaten the world's networks again.

But as it turns out, the Digital Hazard Virus was never completely wiped out, and somehow it was incorporated into Guilmon's data during his creation. When he digivolved into Megidramon, the Digital Hazard corrupted his data, causing his incredible power to surge out of control and disrupt the fabric of the Digital World.

Sensing the very same virus that it was created to destroy, the D-Reaper was alerted to the presence of the Tamers, but having now evolved intelligence decides to infiltrate their group instead in order to learn more about organic life and how to ""delete"" it.

**TL;DR: The Digital Hazard was the first computer virus, and its infection of the Digital World was the real reason for the D-Reaper's creation.**"	t5_2rxw7	True

Zennistrad	23	5	8	"What if Veemon, Hawkmon, and Armadillomon could armor digivolve using both of their respective digi-eggs at once? It'd be sort of like Takuya and Koji from Digimon Frontier using both the Human and Beast Spirits for their Fusion Evolutions.

Here's the idea I have so far:

Veemon: Plasdramon

Title: The Fusion Dragon

Description: An 8-foot-tall humanoid dragon digimon with blue scales and large wings, wearing a breastplate, shoulder guards, greaves, and forearm guards. The right half of his armor is red, and the left half is black. His right shoulder guard resembles Flamedramon's helmet and curved horn, while his left resemble's Raidramon's helmet and lightning-shaped horn.

Attacks: 

* Fusion Flame: Fires a large sphere of orange flames at the opponent.

* Fusion Blitz: Covers his body in light blue electricity and rams the opponent.


Hawkmon: Swallowmon

Title: The Sky Samurai

Description: A 6-foot-tall humanoid bird with red feathers and talon-like feet, a pair of wings folded behind its shoulders, and a swallow's tail. He wears white robes, and the top half of his face and beak is covered with a silver winged helmet, similar to Halsemon's. In his right hand he carries a katana sword.

Attacks:

* Zephyr Slash: Slashes with his sword, launching a razor-sharp blade of air at the opponent.

* Swallow Cut: An impossibly fast attack that slashes the opponent with its sword twice in quick succession.


Armadillomon: Petromon

Title: The Ocean Driller

Description: A 6-foot-tall bipedal humanoid wearing white full-body armor with gold highlights, his rounded head being featureless save a pair of eyes and a harpoon-like nose. White metal fins extend from multiple points on his armor, including its arms, legs, and back, and he carries in his right hand a spear with an elongated drill at the end.

Attacks:

* Drill Torpedo: Launches the drill at the end of the spear at the opponent.

* Black Gold: Launches a glob of crude oil from his spear to slow down the opponent."	t5_2rxw7	True

So then they still can't defeat the other people, so he digivolves again, and he digivolves into Warangemon. Shit was weird. It looked like Greyangemon, except that it's head was Greymon's.

The premise was that they were working for endmon to bring upon the end of the digiworld and had captured beginmon who was suppose to bring the rebirth of it.

1367521416.0	1dkgwg	I'm so excited to finally find this subreddit! Maybe you guys can help me find a childhood toy?	thelightscallmehome	19	3	11	"Tl;dr version: I'm looking for [this](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/2r8XEB8Bae0/0.jpg) Raidramon figure, that came in [this](http://di1-4.shoppingshadow.com/images/pi/6f/8b/85/90065755-260x260-0-0_Pokemon+Digimon+Digivolving+Flamedramon+W+Trading+.jpg) box. (The card is not needed, as I already have it).

Non-tl;dr version:

When I was a kid, my mom got me one of the transforming Raidramon figures that I was just so excited to have. I took it almost everywhere with me to play with it, but mostly in front of the house we lived in at the time. 

One day while playing with said toy, a neighborhood teen came by and found me trying to transform it into... whatever else it was that Raidramon turned into. (I can't remember if it was another form, or the digiegg). This kid asks me if he can try, and like the all too trusting kid I was, I gave it to him. He promptly broke it, threw it in the grass, and told me he was sorry he couldn't fix it. The bastard made me cry!

Anyway, my mom decided it would be better off to give it to GoodWill (at least, I hope it was GoodWill, and not a dumpster). I've been looking for it ever since, but haven't been quite lucky enough to come across a full one. 

So, if anyone has an extra one they wouldn't mind selling, I'm very interested! "	t5_2rxw7	True

It's not possible to digivolve near them, but they make reference to Greymon and Garurumon moving to new areas to take out spires.  The implication is that they digivolve outside the influence of the spire and are able to stay in champion while getting near enough to destroy it.  That's cool and all, but in episode 7, Angemon reverts to Patamon when they get inside a spire's influence.  Any explanation why, or is this just a plot device?	t5_2rxw7	True

* **Appearance**: Nearly identical in to ExVeemon, but with a breastplate and helmet made of translucent sky-blue crystal. His right hand is replaced by a large crystal arm cannon.

* **Attacks**: 

* *Spectrum Blaster*: Shoots a laser from his arm cannon that changes color as it fires.

* *Wonder Blade*: Extends a long, glowing blade from his arm cannon that constantly changes color, and slashes the opponent with it.

----

* **FlutterAngemon**: Wormmon's Ultimate form.

* **Appearance:** A large human figure wearing lime-green armor, with large pink butterfly wings on his back. In his right hand he carries a golden staff with a golden statuette of the Crest of Kindness on top. The top half of his face is obscured by a lime-green helmet bearing Stingmon's eyes.

* **Attacks**:

* *Purification Dust*: Flaps his wings, scattering a fine powder that removes curses and frees digimon from mind control.

* *Heart's Fire*: Shoots a burst of radiant light from his palm at the opponent.

* *Butterfly Rod*: Strikes the opponent with his staff.

----

* **Flailmon**: Armadillomon's Ultimate form.

* **Appearance**: A large, bulky humanoid clad in tan, full-body knight's armor, with Ankylomon's helmet. In his right hand he wields a large flail made of chrome digizoid, and in his left he carries a tower shield resembling Armadillomon's carapace.

* **Attacks**:

* *Meteor Smash*: Uses his flail to attack with tremendous force.

* *Shield Rush*: Charges the opponent with his massive shield, breaking through enemy defenses.

----

* **Pteranomon**: Hawkmon's Ultimate form.

* **Appearance:** A large pteranosaur-like digimon with red skin and a white underbelly. On his back is a large cannon made from chrome digizoid, and the top of his head and beak are covered by a helmet made from the same metal. No relation to [Pteramon](http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/Pteramon).

* **Attacks**:

* *Plasma Cannon*: Fires a burst of superheated plasma from his cannon at the opponent.

* *Sky Bomber*: Tucks in his wings and charges the opponent with his beak from above.

NidorinoTrainer	17	2	30	"I ask this because I just got season 1 in the mail and I immediately started with the Etemon Arc because that's when the concept of the Ultimate Stage was introduced and there were a lot of good episodes in that arc.
My favorite arc though by far would be the Myotismon Arc, especially when the cast gets back to the real world.  I started watching Digimon when it first came out around this time so I like it both for the nostalgia and the plot line.  I also like it how there was a buildup to the pseudoclimax where everyone one by one evolved into their ultimate stage and finally came together on top of the building to face Myotismon.  That episode alone easily ranks as my favorite Digimon episode of all time.
I would love to hear what other Digimon fans say is their favorite arc please explain why!"	t5_2rxw7	True

She was standing with her other friends in a group, cutting a cake. Sora blew out the 18 candles and they cut off a slice. The cake was chocolate,  her favourite. No one at the party felt that it was childish. Except davis, but no one really invited him anyway

For they were just kids when they started their adventures, twelve years old when their lives changed forever. The digimon they met never forgotten, but sometimes, it was just nice to get back to being twelve, even if she was Eighteen.

Tai held onto his gift, close to his chest. Looking around the room he saw the others. TK was getting Kari a piece of cake, and Sora was already into her boyfriends gifts. The silky purple dress was draped across a chair as she swung the tennis racquet around, nearly clocking Matt in the head. Surly more would come from him later that night, but Tai just held onto his gift. 

They’ve been friends forever. From the battle of Heighten View Terrace, right to the events with MaloMyotismon. They have been through alot, but to Tai they had been through more. Her current boyfriend went through the same things they did, but he didnt have the history.

Sora took notice to the box in Tai’s hands. She put the racquet down, and gave matt a piece of cake. “Tai, you Haven’t given me your present yet!” pointing to the small square object that seemed so foreign to him when he realised he was holding it.
“Oh, this” he said with slight hesitation. “Ive just been waiting for the right time”

“Tai, I think the right time was when everyone else was giving me theirs. I wouldn’t want to forget yours”
Tai handed over the gift. The box it came in was small, indicating that it wasnt as expensive as what Matt gave her. But she opened it anyway, she obviously didnt care. 

Putting her eyes on the contents, she became almost furious, but after a moment, a soft smile fell over her. “Stupid Tai”. She took the hair pin out, and placed it in her hair, shaping her beautiful orange bangs.

“I figured you’d like it, since you stopped wearing that dumb hat”. Tai didn’t need to say anything, but he couldn’t resist the flirtation
Sora replied with her own jest “So now you don’t like my hat, huh? Must be very confusing”

The two just smiled at each other,losing themselves in each other eyes. Both knew what was there, but they decided to just let it go. Until Sora gave Tai a kiss on the cheek “Thanks Tai”

The two would remain friends after that, leading perfectly normal lives, until they were called together again, at a most unfortunate time"	t5_2rxw7	True

SonicFlare21	18	6	6	"Alright, so being in a smaller subreddit, I'm sure almost everyone here knows about the Ryo/Millenniummon stories that happened in the Tamer games. Well, apparently those were canon as both Ryo and Millenniummon appear in a [flashback Ken has while dreaming](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dQrwyuX39U). Ryo also appears briefly in [Digimon The Movie](http://imgur.com/DxWuI9A) which is proof that he existed in the Adventure universe.

At the end of Digimon Season 3/Tamers there's a wormhole leading back into the Digital World, which we can later assume played a role in Runaway Locomon, allowing them to reconnect with their Digimon. The story in my head plays out as the following:

Ryo's rookie partner, Monodramon is feeling very ill and eventually succumbs to the pain, resulting in an enormous loss of data. The data is that of a revived, fully powered and revenge seeking Zeed-Millenienniummon. He attacks Ryo and the other tamers out of a fit of rage and says he must destroy ""the other"" as well. This opens a wormhole into another universe. Ryo and Takato tell everyone to get up, as they quickly get their stuff and venture off into the wormhole on a quest to stop this monster. Once they arrive in a town different from their own, Ryo guides them to an apartment. He knocks on the door, and Ken answers it.

Ken rounds up the other 02 Digidestined. Davis and Kari later round up as many originals as they can, before Ryo and Ken explain the scenario that happened the years prior. Takato mentions that ""since he attacked us in the Digital World, he'll probably still be there now!"" to which the group agrees. We later see Tai, Matt, Davis, Kari, Ken, Ryo, Takato, and Rika all join together to venture once again into the Digital World to stop Zeed=Millenniummon once and for all."	t5_2rxw7	True

I explained to him that the franchise, not the show however, actually came before Pokemon but was kind of at loss for words, as I haven't watched the show in a while, either! Nonetheless, I still love it, just maybe am lacking words to articulate it, as I haven't been in a position to compare my love for it to somebody who is...uninitiated.

Basically each part would be a recap of an entire season worth of events. Some interesting information, facts etc. The idea is for people that watched the show, but am unable to watch it anymore due to whatever reason to be reminded why they loved it as well as for newcomers to quickly recap a season. Or even for us that have watched it multiple times just to have some quick reference when we do discussions on here, for example ""whats your favorite season?"" If you get confused with all the characters, digimon, events, etc, then you can watch the playlist to remember  The parts will probably be around 5 minutes each so I will really be feeding you a lot of information.

I might, if this gets enough responses, expand even more and discus sets of episode, every 7 or so as a collective.

We're at over 230 subscribers, and we've got a great community that's been building up. Up until now, I've been managing the reddit on my own, but now that we're slightly bigger, I figured that now would be the perfect time to add our second moderator!

[Seismictoss](http://www.reddit.com/user/Seismictoss) has been awesome. He submitted our reddit logo, managed [/r/Jogress](http://www.reddit.com/r/jogress/) (an alternative Digimon reddit), and has submitted a ton of content here.

A while ago, he said that he was very interested in becoming a moderator here, but since we were so small, I told him that it would be best to wait. Now, though, I think is the perfect time to induct him as the newest moderator here.

So, let's hear it for Seismictoss!"	t5_2rxw7	True

1375595073.0	1jo1yf	Digimon that look like Pokemon?	Zennistrad	12	0	9	"One of the most common complaints that you hear from Pokemon fans about the later generations is how later Pokemon look like Digimon.

While this is, for the most part, not really valid, since the two series have quite distinctive designs, there are a few Digimon out there that really do look like Pokemon, and vice versa.

Here are some I can think of off the top of my head:

[Shakkoumon](http://i.imgur.com/z8okAfZ.png) and [Baltoy](http://i.imgur.com/v1zp1T1.jpg).
