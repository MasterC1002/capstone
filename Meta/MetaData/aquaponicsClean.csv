I don't really want to delve deep into the threads to find out the basics to set up my a small system to get me started. 


Would be a really nice resource if the admins could set up someting on the side where users can contribute to build a nice set up course for different systems etc.

Maybe there is something excuse my ignorance please if so.

What is your favorite video online that best teaches newbies how to build an Aquaponic system from scratch? Feel free to include videos you created yourself, too! My goal is to create a comprehensive list of peer-reviewed videos to help all those aspiring Aquaponicists out there who need our assistance. Thank you in advance for your contributions....Cheers!

**Here is my collection so far (I will update with videos you suggests - pls add a short description about the video and why it's so good/informative/etc):**

(youtube – 22 mins) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtP68IhLTOA. How to build &amp; operate a basic aquaponic system: in-depth tutorial on designing and building a simple outdoor aquaponic system. If you have the time – watch this one first! The song might be the best part: “We’ll this country’s in the pits, and I really should admit, that I feel its time to do something about it…”

(youtube – 6 mins) http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=tea8knevRQI#!. **Simple Patio Aquaponic System:** basic overview of a simple aquaponic system using plastic buckets and wooden boards.

(youtube – 10 mins) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm0-gnDpkLE. **Creative Backyard Aquaponic System:** 360 tour of a three tier system built by a self-proclaimed “bush mechanic” using kiddie pools, wood planks, stone waterfalls, and other natural elements. Wait for it….. “how many fEEsh would let you pet ‘em?!”

(vimeo – 5 mins) http://vimeo.com/30636996. **Nifty design for a rooftop aquaponic system:** explains the benefits and purposes of a proposed design for a DIY modular aquaponic system.

(youtube – 10 mins) http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=VV1p7thOSDM. **Factory-sized aquaponic system in Milwaukee:** informal tour of the Growing Power Urban Farm facilities, explaining how his farm grows in the winter using minimal resources. Farmer, Tim Allen, describes the features of the system, mechanics of its solar pump, use of compost, and the water conservation benefits of using a modular aquaponic system that recycles the same water to feed fish and fertilize plants.

(youtube – 6 mins) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCCN4nq7BlQ. **Portable Farm’s Patented Aquaponic System:** informative video about aquaponic systems from commercial aquaponicist (aquaponist?) in Southern California that developed a system requiring little maintenance or skill on the part of the grower. He calls aquaponics “disruptive technology…Will this change the world? In 25 years, this will be part of the landscape…people won’t notice them anymore. They will be THAT pervasive.”

**update1** Thank you everyone for your comments and interest. Here is my blog with links that I will update this weekend (so please submit more!). I have not responded until now bc my own enthusiasm for aquaponics motivated this insanely busy city girl to build a small aquaponic system on my patio. I'm blogging about my experiences as I go (so you can avoid some of the mistakes I made). 
**http://www.farmxchange.org/category/diy-aquapnics/**

**update2** So apparently, this one inventor owns an issued patent that claims the right to all types of aquaponic methods and systems. Great, me along with all aquaponic farmers are literally patent infringers.

I have a solar powered greenhouse with a standard IBC-type system and a compost bin where I'm growing Black Soldier Flies, I'll be adding duckweed as soon as I can find some. It seems to be working, but I'm worried that I'm starving my fish. Is there a way I can quantify the nutrition of the BSFL vs commercial fish food? Has there ever been a nutritional analysis done on duckweed and BSFL? Can they be grown quickly enough to serve as the only food for the fish? 

How much duckweed can be grown in a day? I've heard that it can double its mass in a short time, but what is the optimal setup for growing it quickly? I'm thinking shallow troughs (rain gutters) running around the greenhouse in currently unused nooks and crannies.

Algae will be ever-present of course, and that can provide some nutrients, but surely not enough. Are there any other feed plants I should consider? Any other Critters?"	t5_2rioe	True

Brown 2005](http://www.earth-policy.org/books/out/out_table_of_contents)

&gt;Another promising new animal protein production model has also evolved in China, this one in the aquacultural sector. China has evolved a carp polyculture production system in which four species of carp are grown together. One species feeds on phytoplankton. One feeds on zooplankton. A third feeds on grass. And the fourth is a bottom feeder. These four species thus form a small ecosystem, with each filling a particular niche. This multi-species system, which converts feed into flesh with remarkable efficiency, yielded some 13 million tons of carp in 2002

I still have some questions on what kind of soil to use, and what key factors to pay attention to other than PH and water temperature.  hamseatlambs summed up most of my questions effectively for my post before, so refer to that.

Also, in the recent video on /r/videos the guy seems to have a constant water flow, but the name of the system it looks like is called ""Flood and Drain"" Does this mean that I periodically have to turn a knob or control the water flow between the two? If it isn't done manually, then how is it done? I'm not understanding the plumbing aspect of this field very well.

Another thing with plumbing, what would the ideal ratio of the pump water flow to grow bed size?

i've been a ""on again/off again"" user in /r/aquaponics for about two years now and I just figured I'd get back to you with some lessons, advice (for the new), and sharing my experiences. It's a novel - sorry it's quite long. 

Here's some advice. Feel free to dispute this but I believe it has some merit - these are a few things that I believe I would have wanted before getting into it. NOTE: This is NOT to discourage anyone. Just stating experiences.

Advice: 

1. Ask yourself WHY you want to do this. I have two reasons why I need to start with this. First, this isn't a cheap hobby / endeavor. And second, doing this for decent income isn't something you can do with a small / medium scale build. To clarify my two statements for you - many videos/ website testaments claim to give instructions or hacks for systems that are cheap (range between $10-$20) - but if you add up all of these things, it can be quite costly.  Regarding income - I suggest you take a look at seed to plant to harvest cycles for the plant you would want to grow - harvest seasons / off season plans need to be taken into account - year round costs for electricity, water, and failure (many, many, many failures). If you've done all this, consider your costs for investment and still turn out with a profit - go right ahead. Otherwise, I'd suggest you do this as a hobby. 

2. Expect death - I'm sorry to say that in my two years of tinkering and experimenting - I've had some much death on my hands. I'm talking about fish, and plants. As a rough estimate, I've killed about 40 gold fish / feeder fish. 3 dozen plants (various kinds). And had to kill a few rats (from my one successful season) - no pics sorry. This two things are probably the only negative things I'd have to say about aquaponics.

3. For those trying this out on a indoor setup / around places that have restricted space (like condos). ALWAYS make sure that you have a plan b for pipe failure / water failure / pump failure. I've pretty much had all kinds of catastrophes - i'll let you google them in detail but examples I've had are: a. Pump failure (due to power blackout) - tubing reversed after my reserve power was depleted and some of my tubes (didn't know this at the time) became siphons. Water started flowing back and flooded my floors. b. Exit valves should be bigger - after my pump failure, I resorted to using a different pump that I was used to (borrowed). The flow of water ended up with major overflows and flooded my plant beds / aquariums (2 instances). Best advice is use I can give is - whatever your entry pipe is for water flow, make sure your exit pipe is 2 times bigger. or at least have a backup overflow system. It'll save you so much trouble in the future. 

4. If you're starting out - make friends with your local pet store and plant shops. You'll be seeing them a lot. Use large sapplings for plants and goldfish at first. If you feel your system is stable - move on to more complicated tasks. currently, i'm working on single touch planting (complete seed to plant to harvest techniques). I started out using baby sapplings and it was heartbreaking to see them not grow or die. Sapplings can survive quite a bit of abuse. and goldfish are nitrate goldmines. I'm basically trying to save you the heart break. 

5. Low maintenance my ass! Don't believe this lie. It has a lot of maintenance involved but less backbreaking once you have good infrastructure and experience behind you. Things you will encounter that are quite difficult are: clay media cleaning - for old roots (i know i'm going to get flack for this). water inspections for ph levels (this things can get expensive over the years). pump / pipe replacement - this applies only if you're tinkering / fucking around with your system and experimenting. I can go deeper into this but i'll save this for another time. Nonetheless - it's still easier than the actual farming and you'll use less pesticides and if you're really cleaver - you can setup your system to have solutions for these problems. 

6. Addiction. It's like playing god. well if you're that type of person. It's hard at first, you're not going to be good. In fact - you're going to fail. But all my failures were made up for the fact that I was able to grow and harvest my plants. And plant variations. And after that - plant mixtures. It's kinda like owning a cat or stockholm syndrome. It'll give you so much shit to deal with but the success is priceless. 


Life lessons:

1. This will teach you so much patience and diligence. It's fantastic because you have visible progress that's a live and you can benefit with (to eat that is). 

2. Don't trust every instructional video you see - these are upsell products for you to buy more shit from them. If anything - ask the /r/aquaponics gurus or read separate forums and pages. You'll learn more and it's good knowledge in carpentry and plumbing if you're gonna DIY this. I think I've earned about +3 skill points in both. Yes, I'm still lousy at it. But better. Manpoints and real life experience is awesome. 

3. Being resourceful and creative were the most useful tools - it's a double edged sword in a way. It can help cut so much costs if you figure out ways to balace the nitrogen cycle, feeding schedules, and seasons with a few skills and know how. Also - google is your best friend. reddit advanced search is that other dude you can kinda rely on. 

Strange experiences:

1. Living in an agricultural country - I was laughed at for even trying this (like Noah). When my neighbors and even people heard that my system worked. They changed their minds and saw me as some kind of science guru. But I did get a threat saying that I shouldn't teach this to farmers or apply this in a commercial setting. Some people in my area just don't like change. 

2. Got approached by a dealer who was looking to grow some shit. He offered my a large sum to build (not teach) on top of the equipment and my time. I honestly got spooked and didn't take the deal when I learned there was an entire group eyeing my ""research"". Explained that it's just not cost effective (being in an agricultural country). Still believe I dodged that bullet.

For those curious: 

* system I used was flood drain system. Testing floating raft systems now. Looking to go back to flood drain after my experiment with seeds.
* successes were: basil, tomatoes, eggplant, stevia, watermelon, chili pepper plants? and a few others I can't recall. 
* new experiments / challenges I'm working on: 1. using maximum of 1 25 watt waterpump only for 6 growbeds, 1 60 gallon tank, and a sump w/o airstone. Yes it's possible. Fishless aquaponics. Not sure how to categorize it if i do apply this. And seed to plant growing techniques. (no success here)

If the rest of you guys have more experiences that perhaps I didn't include, i'd like to hear them.

I am knowledgable in traditional farming practices, and will be living on a farm in Montana learning the business side of things all summer. Aransas Pass is only sand so my initial thought was raised beds inside of a hoop house or greenhouse. I have learned the basics of aquaponics and it makes so much sense in a place where food doesn't normally grow. But honestly, my knowledge is not yet sufficient, especially if I am trying to have a farm that can provide to local restaurants, the community, and at a farmers market. 

The land is considered to be in a food desert and is in a poorer area. I plan to help support the local community. 10 miles away is Port Aransas, a town on an island that is very expensive and would rush to a place where fresh food is being created.

Can you guys help me? What resources should I look at to find more info about ""large-scale"" aquaponics.

Ran to the garage to find Kid B had thrown a handful of weed killing yard pellets into the fish tank (thinking it was fish food I guess).  We scooped out the pellets the best we could but the fish ingested some/some dissolved.  Didn't know what to do so we waited several hours and the fish seemed okay.  Now, a week later, the plants are looking unhealthy with limbs dying and leaves yellowing/shriveling.  Further, chemical tests show that pH took a dive to the acidic end of the spectrum at 6.0 or less (no surprise there; the weed killer ingredients listed several acids), ammonia is off the scale with greater than 8 ppm, and nitrites have disappeared entirely with 0 ppm (oddly enough, nitrate levels are still steady at 40-80 ppm).  Not sure what to do - anyone have some advice?

Update: Ordered some bacteria - should get here early next week. I'm going to spend the next few days doing water exchanges. Wish me luck!

Update 2: Did a 1/3 water change and added bacteria solution a couple days ago.  Also, added pH up (until I ran out) and then added baking soda.  That got my pH back to the 6.8-7.0 range.  Then, MAGIC!  Nitrites spiked to 8 ppm and ammonia level started to go down.  I think the bacteria 'woke' up when the pH returned to a healthy level.  Fish seem happy and healthy, but the plants look pretty rough.  At least the system is saved - thank you all for your help! "	t5_2rioe	True

A pre-fab shelf with the tank on the bottom and 2-3 levels of growbeds above looks like it could work out very nicely. The biggest problem is vertical space though. A commercial CFL or HPS fixture takes up at least 6-8 inches which would be about a third of my available space...

I am looking at building an LED array from scratch to minimize vertical space. for about $70 you can get enough high power LEDs to give 6000 lumens (2000 lumens per sq foot) which should be plenty for simple greens.

The ones I am looking at are 4500k, but other temperatures could easily be added if needed.

Do any of you have experience with LEDs for growing in general? The commercial LED lights look extremely over priced which is why I am looking at soldering up my own. ( I know electronics quite well)

**UPDATE:**
I made a quick mock-up with the components that just came in. These guys are BRIGHT, almost dangerously so. Really have to take care not to look at them directly.

I will definitely need some decent thermal management for these. I am thinking of milling out a quick little aluminum water block and pipe some of the circulating water through; bit concerned about solids clogging it though, will be sure to keep it a wide bore. My location is cold and would probably need a water heater anyways. Good utilization of wastes I think.

http://imgur.com/a/OyWyA

Things are going great.  I have had. more success with the project so far than I was expecting.  In some cases the growth (edemame ? and the oregon sugar peas) is noticeable each day - the former growing up to 2 inches a day in a couple cases lately.  Some have reached the light.

I've added some new seeds around, and thinned some of the growbed out (since just about every seed I sowed has germinated and sprouted up)...I need to figure out what to do with about 25 tomato seedlings that are happily rooting away...they can't all survive the 8 inch container they're in).  I think that only the Sage is growing slowly and wasn't as successful (yet?)...I'll replant some sage seed soon to see.  I had a failed batch of carrot seed that I was told later were, ""quite old"", but the rest - success!  Even the popcorn seed I grabbed off my shelf (several years old) has produced some shoots and roots in the case or 50% of the seed I tossed in the little seed greenhouse I have and forgotten about for 2 weeks); garlic that I planted has started rooting in a couple of cases, but not in others - so we'll see how that does.

I've added some mini gourds (a mix), some feverfew, chives (coming up nicely), more carrots that are now working (finger and mignon?), peppermint, and hops.  I managed to find some venus fly trap seed online, so I'll be trying that around the setup to see how they do (if at all).... and I'll have to figure out what to do with the other seed I'd ordered that should arrive this week (bonsai, some more pepper, and a couple others not coming to mind right now.

Bonus report: the automatic feeder I picked up for $20 (shipped) from dx.com has been working great so far.  Here's a video of it in action (along with my 4 quick-to notice me leaning over their tank to feed them goldfish):

I've had this going for about 3 months now. Hopefully the weather stays above freezing for a while. I've got about 10 spinach plants, 5 chamomile plants, 3 tomato plants, and 1 victorian lettuce plants. I use a 35 gallon trash bin for my fish tank, with about 20 feeder goldfish. For the grow bed, I'm using a rubbermaid under the bed style tray (which leaks, will fix next season). The grow bed is on some old planks I found that are lifted on sawhorses. I'm using pea gravel for the growth medium. I am using a continuous-flow style system for the moment, next season I might try to get fancy and rig ebb and flow. The PVC system I set up gives me room to add 3 more grow beds for a total of 4. In the grow bed I'm using, it's getting a little crowded. I didn't expect the spinach to grow as big as it has, so next time I'll space the plants out better. All together, I probably spent &gt;$200. The most expensive piece was the water pump bringing the water to the grow bed, which I think was about $60. I've since found a much cheaper pump at Harbor Freight. I think the tomatoes will die before they bear any fruit, but I think the spinach, chamomile, and lettuce will be ok as long as I keep the frost off of them.

So here it goes.

The primary system:
Fish and shrimp in the tank, veggies in the green-house on the roof. System is being heatet on demand with warm water from the evacuated tube collector.

The secondary system: 
On top of the tank is a worm bin. Worms fall out of the bottom occasionally and get eaten by the fish (not primary goal though). On top of the worm bin are the rabbit cages. Rabbit manure is given to the worms in controlled quantities.

Also on top of the tank is a BSF larvae bin. Mature laevae self-harvest either directly or indirectly to the fish. On top of the larvae bin is the ""fly zone"" where BSF can mate and lay eggs again. The ""fly zone"" is heatet on demand with hot water pipes. On top of it all is the chicken coop. Chicken manure is given to the BSFL in controlled quantities.

That's about it. I think it could work. But probably there are tons of things I haven't thought about. Please let me know what you think.

1359318108.0	17ducf	I was recently asked to build a large-scale aquaponic greenhouse system. Does anyone have advice, experience, or resources concerning larger systems?	GreenCharlie	27	5	15	"I'll try to describe this project as concisely as possible:


As early as August, I will be constructing (at least) one 30' x 60' greenhouse (1800 square feet), which will be irrigated by an already existing fish pond nearby.  The pond is approximately 30' x 12' x 5' deep, which puts it at about 13,500 gallons. This whole system will be constructed in southern China, by the way.


Now I've researched all of the following questions quite a bit already, and I do have some idea about to proceed with each, but I don't yet feel like I have a complete grasp on every aspect of this whole thing. In other words, please don't feel as though I'm merely handing the work off to you lovely folks at /r/aquaponics to do for me.  I'm just looking for a good dialogue where we can all bounce ideas back and forth.

I'll break down my questions by type:

**Greenhouse:** 

* Given it's dimensions (30' x 60'), does anyone have suggestions for the construction?  Are there any existing systems, for instance, that I may be wise to replicate? Any schematics or plans floating around?

* I'm also still trying to decide what an appropriate height would be, what materials I should use, etc. 

* Additionally, the system itself will be in a very rural area, so I hope to supplement much of the heating costs with natural sources, whether that be composting, rocket mass heating, biogas digesting, or some combination of natural energy sources.  Have any of you had success doing this on a large scale?

**Grow bed:**

* Given that the greenhouse itself is approximately 1800 square feet, how much space do you think I can/should devote to my growbeds?

* To appropriately filter the fish pond, how much volume should my growbeds contain?  I assume that grow bed surface area is a greater factor in filtration than depth when comparing the volume ratio between the pond and the beds.  Is this true? 

* Is 1' a reasonable depth for a grow bed in a larger system?
For instance, if I were to have 1500 square feet of grow beds at 1 foot deep, this gives me a volume of 11,221 gallons (compared to 13,500 in the fish pond).  This is less than 1:1, and therefore less than ideal.  On the other hand, I feel like anything much deeper than a foot would be approaching too deep. Any thoughts?

* Is there one predominant advantage to using the flood and drain method or the floating raft method in a larger system?  I anticipate utilizing each for their respective advantages, but any insights are welcome.


**Pond:** 

* At 13,500 gallons, what is the maximum number of fish I could farm at any given moment?  Is the normal ratio affected when you scale up so drastically?
* I should point out that this farm will be in China, so it currently holds carp.  Does anyone have experience mixing fish varieties in an aquaponics system?  I'm particularly concerned that some varieties might pose a threat to different kinds of baby fish.
* I don't anticipate needing a sump because of how large the pond is.  Does anyone disagree?
* The system will be built in Southern China near the mountains, and it does get cold during the winter. The pond itself is largely aesthetic (as well as functional), so it can't be cluttered too greatly with pipes or insulation, etc. Does merely pumping water through the growbeds heat it enough to keep things warm in the pond, or will this cold water negatively impact my plants?
* Might there be a problem with the greenhouse being a little way away from the pond?  Obviously, the pump will need to be strong enough to carry the water, but any other concerns with this?

Thanks so much for reading through this ""great wall"" of text.  Any general thoughts about this project, or answers to any of these questions will be VERY VERY much appreciated! Thanks, as always, r/aquaponics!"	t5_2rioe	True

After spending a great deal of time last weekend washing and hauling gravel I discovered a leak in the tank. After sealing it this week I finally put the last piece of the puzzle in this morning, filed the tank and...

IT WORKED! It is happily ebbing and flowing away as I type.

I am so excited I can hardly breathe. I'll take some pictures when I get a chance, although it is not the prettiest of things.

Thanks for all the info guy!

EDIT: [Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/bZVjp)

Cost breakdown
*Tank - Free, salvaged from a skip beside my office. It needed sealing but that wasn't a biggy

*Frame - Free, salvaged from our recent office refurbishment. It happened to be EXACTLY the right size and really spurred the whole project on

*Growbeds - 2 for £15. also reusable if this doesn't work for some reason

*20mm Gravel - 200kg for ~£15. It was cheaper to buy 200kg than the 160 I needed. also reusable if the project fails

*Pump - ~£10 from ebay. A 1200lph powerhead.

*Aeration - Free, left over from my daughters fish tank.

*Pipe and other fittings - ~£10

I still need to make a cover for it and I've got some wood kicking around from some dismantled shelves.

The low price was one of the main thing which enabled the project to pass the Wife test. I've planted some trailing tomatoes to cover the growbeds eventually and will plant some tallish plants in the planted to cover the tank.

1375126397.0	1jaoon	Rules of thumb for siphons.	tewls	21	1	8	"There are some simple to understand rules of thumb that should help you tinker with your siphon.  The first RoT is rather intuitive.  The larger the diameter of your drain pipe the higher the input flow of water must be to start the siphon.  We'll call it GPH (gallons per hour) since that is a common pump measurement unit. http://imgur.com/a/Jw4oJ#0

The less understood principle is that the further below your grow bed your drain pipe extends, the more GPHs it will take to create equilibrium.  We don't want to create equilibrium ever.  We want constant flood or drain.  http://imgur.com/a/Jw4oJ#1

The understanding behind the second principle isn't too hard to understand.  When water falls it gains momentum and therefore has more force.  In this case the force is going down and creating a vaccum above itself.  The further the water has to fall the more force it has and creates a stronger vaccum above itself.  The stronger the vaccum the more it will pull.  If it is pulling more than the water pump can provide it will start pulling in air.  If it pulls in enough air, the air will kill the water siphon.

Disclaimer:  I hate bell siphons.  They are cool, but they are inconsistent.  For hobby growers at home it can even be a headache.  I suggest making one for kicks and giggles but not using one in a system you want to behave consistently.

**TL;DR**  If your siphon won't start get a more powerful pump or a thinner drain pipe.  If your siphon won't stop (aka reaches equilibrium) get a longer drain pipe or cut down the input into your grow bed.  There are a ton of other little things you can do, but these are the most simple and most consistent ways to fix a bell siphon."	t5_2rioe	True

See the new video post here: http://verticalfoodblog.com/biological-surface-area-in-aquaponics/ 

Growing with aquaponics can be a fantastic way to experience higher yields, better efficiency and healthier plants. One aspect of this type of production method that often gets overlooked is Biological Surface Area (BSA) in Aquaponics.

Understanding Biological Surface Area In Aquaponics

This post is to help you better understand the importance of biological and specific surface area to produce higher yields and fewer frustrating mistakes!

What is Biological Surface Area?

Biological Surface Area in AquaponicsBe sure to watch the video!

To start, Biological Surface Area (BSA) is the amount of surface area inside your system that microbes can live on. BSA is very important in aquaponic systems because these microbes are the engines of a healthy aquaponics system. They oxidize ammonia, assist in nitrification and mineralizes materials like iron in order to foster healthy plant growth and a healthy system overall."	t5_2rioe	True
1367727712.0	1dpthw	The short (Okay not so short) but thorough guide to fishless cycling.	tewls	24	2	17	"What is fishless cycling?
-
Fishless cycling is the process of growing two types of bacteria in your aquaponics system.  Fish excrete waste which breaks down into ammonia, these two bacteria change the ammonia into nitrite (via nitrosonomas) and nitrite into nitrate (via nitrobacters) which your plants thinks is delicious.  Yummy nitrates.

Why fishless cycle?
-
Because it's the fastest way to get these bacteria to grow and you won't be torturing little fishies that will probably die without the presence of these bacteria.  In a closed system ammonia and nitrites are toxic to fish even in small quantities, while nitrate is also toxic, the plants should eat it up and keep it well below toxic levels.

What will I need to have/buy?
-
- (Optional, but really really really helps speed it up)  Media from a disease free already established aquarium THAT YOU NEVER ALLOW TO GET DRY, EVER!
- A water heater.
- A dechlorination method or product.
- Your *ponics system cycling.
- A pH up and down regulation product.
- Plenty of aeration.  Small systems should do fine with just a pump and the draining from the grow bed to the fish tank.  The more disolved oxygen the better though.
- *Pure* ammonia.  This can be a hard product to come by, just remember if it's not clear it isn't pure.  If it suds up at all when you shake the bottle it's not pure.  I buy mine from Ace Hardware, but I've heard some walmarts have it and some dollar generals.

Quickest way to fishless cycle.
-
**^A)** Keep your pH around 7.5.  Nitrosonomas seem to grow best in 8.0 pH and nitrobacters seem to prefer 7.3.

**^B)**  Buy a water heater and crank that puppy up!  Bacteria love them some 87°F water!

**^C)**  Make sure your water ain't toxic!  If your water has chlorine just let it cycle a few days through the pump and it will naturally degass.  If it has ~~chlorimate~~ chloramine then you need to buy something to dechlorinate your water (ascorbic acid works just fine).

**^C.5** (Optional)  Shake that media around in your water like a polaroid picture!  Those bacteria are on that media you stole from some poor childs aquarium and you gotta shake 'em off!  Shake it real good because you know what to do!  Then leave that media in your system for a few weeks.

**^D)** Now add ~5ppm ammonia.  Anything above 8ppm seems to stunt the growth, so if you add too much, dump a lot of your water and add some more water to dilute until it's ~5ppm.

**^E)** It can be the case that you are missing some micronutrients the bacteria want.  Add a tiny tiny bit of fish food and this should cover their needs.  Specifically phospate seems to be the lacking ingredient.

**^F)** Make sure your pump is flowing or even better add some air stones or some high tech solutions like vortex aerators or venturi aerators.

Now what?
-
Test daily.  Keep your ammonia levels ~5ppm until you see nitrites show up.  Once they show up I recommend not adding anymore ammonia for a few days.  It takes nitrobacter longer to show up than nitrosonomas so once the *bacters start showing up you want to starve and kill a bit of your *sonomas in order to give your *bacters a chance to colonize and party, because there ain't no party like the kind where you watch the people who feed you starve and die off so that you have room to chill.

Then, once you see your first signs of nitrate, add plants to eat that stuff up.  Once you can add ~2-3ppm if ammonia and your system can eat it all up in 24 hours (A.K.A. your ammonia and nitrites read 0ppm).  Add them fishies and you're done!  Congrats you just did the most importantest thing in aquaponics, because who cares about fish and plants.  We're growing bacteria.  That other crap is just a side product to what we grow.

Does anyone have any experience working with bamboo, or any advice pertaining to its use?  Would it leech anything unhealthy into the water?  Would it rot over time?

1351082456.0	1203n2	With the recent video about Aquaponics on r/videos, I have some questions after reasearch and first design ideas. As I live in a flat I am going for a 13 galon setup.	Mchanger	22	1	8	"[After this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=3IryIOyPfTE) was posted I was instantly inspired. Since I have always wanted to have fish, but didn't see the use, I now know what I want to do.

I want to set up a small ""drain and flow"" AP system for my room. This means I am going to be using a very small fish tank (50l or ~13g). My growing-bed will be around the same size in width and length, but swallower. 

The fish tank will be around 60x30x30 and my growing-bed I thought would be 60x30x20. 

This is the design I have come up with: [*sorry for poor quality picture*](http://imgur.com/EO76p)

I will have the fish tank below the growing-bed. I will build a stand for the growing bed. As in the sketch I am thinking of holding the growing-bed on it's corners or building rails for it to lay on. Will this work? Or will it be too heavy? 

For the drain, I am going to use a bell siphon with a ""L"" drainage. [This video helped me a lot to understand how it works.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4i-jZoynUs&amp;feature=plcp) (also through various research). Can I use a bell siphon for such a small set up? Or is there another more ideal siphon?

My questions:

- Will the ratio of water in the fish tank to growing-bed work? (50l in the fish tank and about 36l in the growing-bed)

- Which fish or rather how many am I able to put into a 50l tank?

- If I am only allowing the growing-bed 20cm as root space, which plants can I grow? I am thinking more lettuce and herbs.

- Does this design even work?

Any advice is appreciated! Thanks in advance! 

EDIT: [I made another design](http://imgur.com/rkJe8) stabilizing the growing-bed more. However I am not too sure if it will be too dark for the fish or not.

Also I just realized that it is ""growbed"" :) "	t5_2rioe	True

G'day guys!

I'm Aaron. My housemate Anna and I have been building this aquaponics setup over the course of a few days. We plan to have an array of 6 tanks, with two grow beds on each.

Currently it's running a 3000L/hr pump (iirc) and uses expanded clay as the growing medium. The tank is a 1200L IBC.

We've got a mixed salad garden in this one currently as our testbed. After this, we'll look at specific grow beds for fruit, herbs, melons, leaf plants, etc. As far as critters go, we've got WA Marron in there currently (Cherax tenuimanus). I plan to get some Barramundi going in the next tank :)

1329675021.0	pwmkc	Anyone ever tried to use airlift pumps in the system?	imbecile	21	3	7	"When I learned about aquaponics a while ago, i grew a little obsession and read and watched all I could find for a while.

Some of the main facts that I learned where:

* the system always needs abundant aeration
* the most power and maintenance intensive and failure prone part of any system is the pump

That gave me the idea that you could make a very reliable and low maintenance [airlift pump](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airlift_pump) by simply adding a pipe to an aerator exit. ([here the somewhat more detailed German wikipedia with a nice graph on the operating parameters](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammutpumpe)).

The main question then of course is, if the capacity and lifting power of this could be sufficient to run a whole system with.  
That of course needs experimentation and probably a few system adjustments like having smaller differences in top levels of the fish tank and the grow beds, maybe a deeper sump that also uses an airlift pump with an aerator, different flow speeds etc.

But if it can be made to work, this would have several big advantages.

1. You remove the pump with mechanically moving parts and the high energy consumption
2. You doubly use the energy needed to aerate to also move the water around
3. Aerators usually are linear membrane pumps, which are some of the cheapest, most efficient, silent and robust electric devices, with small enough power consumption to be run off grid

This is all theorizing of course, but from what I have read is, that the water volume transported in an airlift pump is generally lower than the air volume, but in the same order of magnitude. That means if you blow 2000 l/h air into the system, it should be possible to move 1000 l/h water even in not so optimal setups."	t5_2rioe	True

So first of all, I just want to say this sub is awesome. I've been reading up today, and have already learned so much. On top of this, my recent discovery of the magic that is aquaponics...I am at a loss for words. I am addicted to this new hobby! I cant wait to finally get started.

So the GF and I are moving into a new place, and we will finally have a yard. We will have a normal in-ground garden, but now we are wanting to do a basic aquaponics setup as well. I understand how it works, the basics, etc. My main question is if anyone has a goto guide for a medium-sized backyard setup? I found lots of good indoor guides, which is what we originally planned to do. But since we will have the space, we might as well go bigger, especially if it means more/bigger fish and plants!

I've seen a lot of setups with barrels, or 'barrelponics'. This seem pretty cool, and not too complicated. Or the oversized rubbermaid setup - 2 decent sized beds on top of a 100 gallon rubbermaid tub.

So what do ya'll think? We dont move for another month and a half, but I want to go ahead and get the supplies, and ever part of the build going. I'm so excited to get it going!

1362228386.0	19iqgv	Control systems	Googleproof	18	2	15	"So for my physics/electronics honours year project, I've decided on building from the ground up a control system for an aquaponic system/greenhouse. I'm basically going to try and put together a small microcontroller (either arduino or ATMEGA16 series, if you're familiar. I want it to be a cheap board) with a bunch of sensors and controls that run all the day to day stuff of an arbitrary aquaponics system, so that you could ostensibly leave your system happily bubbling along without any input from for a few weeks. I'd put it up open source once I'm done. The end product would have a serial connection to the user's PC, with adjustments and displays of the logs from various sensors.

What I'm interested in what I might be missing out on when it comes to sensors. The big obvious things are:

* Water pH
* Medium pH
* Water level
* Water temperature
* Water oxygenation levels
* Humidity (for greenhouses)
* Light levels

And a bunch of things to adjust these to constant levels, as well as some daily routine tasks, like running pumps, bubblers, and some device to drop food into the fishtank.

**Does it smell?**

2. SAND the inside of all the PVC tubes that I drilled holes in. (seriously bloody knuckles are the result)

3. Glue down the exterior protector tube.  I have had to clean out gravel twice now.

4. Make sure the gravel is higher than the waterline when full. It works ok but sometimes the syphon won't kick in when it should and the plant bases stay floating in crappy water.

5. LESS FISH.  I probably should  have only had about 20 tilapia max.  I think I have about 50. The pump tube gets clogged up due to all the crap in the tank, slowing water flow and stalling the syphon action.

However, the system seems like it would work perfectly with a small aquaponics setup.  I have a 5 gallon water cooler jug that I’m going to use as my fish tank for a betta and a few ghost shrimp (I may also add an African dwarf frog).  I have this same setup in a 5 gallon aquarium on my computer desk and it seems to work well.  I have an airlift that will bring the fish water up to the plants.  I’m hoping to grow strawberries, and some herbs.  Do you think that this system will provide enough nutrients to grow strawberries, or should I stick to some herbs?  I don’t really have the option for a bigger fish tank at the moment.  This being my first experiment setting up a system in my apartment, I’m trying to do it as cheaply as possible.  Do you think this will work?  Any other thoughts?	t5_2rioe	True

I'm curious because everyone appears to have their plumbing exposed to sunlight. All of my research has said that it breaks down and leaches some chemical components into the water, faster when exposed to sunlight.

Since this is a closed loop system would this not concentrate in the system much faster? Would it also make the plants and fish unfit for consumption? What about other plumbing options like vitrified clay pipes?

Just curious what you all think. My father and I are designing and building a 30 gallon system with larger aspirations in the future. We want to make sure that we can grow food safely and keep our system clean.

1352950500.0	137ykj	Opening an aquaponics greenhouse at my highschool and I could use a little advice.	ClassyAlpha	18	3	6	"Alright, so, I'm a 16 year old in my junior year of highschool(11th grade), and I've become really interested in aquaponics. I absolutely LOVE the idea of a self sustaining system and whatnot. 
I talked to my plant science teacher about opening a greenhouse with an aquaponics system, and was told what I already knew; I am going to need a plan of the greenhouse and a budget. Now, I'm shooting for less than 5 grand(Which i think would be relatively easy). I doubt that we will be able to eat the fish, as that requires filleting and as you all know American school lunches aren't that sophisticated..

The System:
-Can't be too large, has to be manageable by students
-Probably solar heated(I live in New England so it gets cold in winters)
-Probably some solar panels for electricity as well
-Under 5000$

I'm sure it can be done, but I haven't experimented on my own. I understand the principles and the science behind it, I just have yet to do it myself and put it to life.

I've seen a lot of great ""Beginning"" posts on here, which have all been really helpful; the biggest challenge for me would be pricing out the materials so I can present my idea to the administrators of the school.


My questions:
1. Does the greenhouse have to be a specific type? I realize this would be the most expensive piece. Do you have any suggestions for what is good/bad?
2.Can I make the greenhouse completely functional with ONLY the solar power? How much would electricity would I need to run the pump?
3.Would Solar Heating even work for new england weather?

Any advice, suggestions, and resources(like websites to by the tubing and stuff) would be GREATLY appreciated.

I have been designing an aquaponic system and the cyclical plant/fish relationship helps, but for trace elements I hit a bit of a wall. I don't want to have to buy nutrient packs or something like that continuously.

I was wondering mainly, then, if anyone knew of or had information on DIY nutrients. Some ideas I had were as follows:

 - Scooping in some mud from the bottom of a lake or creek every few days.

 -   Extracting usable forms of certain elements from household products and a little chemical ingenuity.

 -   Including compost tea in the water bank. Probably brewed from from a vermicomposter.

 - Pee in the water.

Thoughts/comments/suggestions?

As a clarification:
I'm not trying to be ""cheap,"" I'm just trying to experiment with making these types of systems as efficient and resourceful as possible. I'm not expecting amazing yields at first, but that's part of the process. Maybe there is a way of telling you how much of the relevant elements in your pee are easily detectable or not. You can always pee in a cup and dip in a litmus-type chromatography strip. Maybe that test can tell you exactly how much urine you should dump out of the beaker you just peed in.

I need your advice on what I think can be a great project! I volunteer for a Dutch non-profit which is currently building a vocational training center in Tanzania. I do fundraising and help with the build. 

Two weeks ago I found the 'back to the roots' kickstarter project of aquaponics and it sparked my interest in aquaponics. After a little more research I contacted the chairman of the non-profit and I introduced him to aquaponics, it was like love at first sight and he told me to do more research and make a project-proposal. Because I never build a aquaponics system, I'm turning to you for help.
 
I want to know which type of aquaponic system fits best in this occasion. The plan is that I will build a test setup this summer and teach the students and staff of the school about aquaponics and their system. If it works as planned, they can expand the system. 

info about the project:
* The school is located on the slopes of the Kilimanjaro, at around 4600 ft meter altitude. 

* The school is located about 200 miles south of the equator

* The school will have 600 students by 2017, mostly orphans who eat and sleep at the school-side 

* The ultimate goal of this project would be to feed the students and staff, and teach them about aquaponics, maybe they can set up their own aquaponic business when they graduate. 

* Since so close to the equator, daylight varies from 11.85 to 12.5 hours a day

* Labor cost is very very cheap, tools/material is relatively expensive

* We can make a investment, but we want to keep the running cost as low as possible

* Volcanic rock is in present (can be used as media?) 

* Electricity is very unreliable (every day has a few hours of no-electricity 

* Stream with melt water from the Kilimanjaro is on the edge of the plot (possible for harvesting energy?)

* Temperature is steady I think, in cool season around 65, warm season around 75, see graph at: http://i.imgur.com/OE0yqjT.png

Questions: 

* What type of aquaponic system? Media bed, Deep water culture, Nutrient film technique or different kinds? Off course i have a idea, but just want to hear your advice!

* Is it better to have 1(or a few) large system, or a lot of small systems? 

* What kind of fish is best suited? We were thinking of tilapia, since it grows fast and eats a wide variety of foods, and temperature is good i guess.

* Are their things I haven't though off which might be a big influence? 

I really appreciate all help! When I will build the project I'll try to keep you updated with pictures. 

Thanks in advance!

[Picture 1](http://imgur.com/hWofE) | [Picture 2](http://imgur.com/biZ1j)

Notes: The grow beds will be using Bell Siphons and drain into the two sump tanks - which are connected to each other via underground piping. I couldn't figure out the best way to do this without moving the fish tank closer to the front, which would ultimately block the entrance into the greenhouse.

Water volume:
Half drum (100L) x 6 = 600 Litres
IBC top Grow bed = ~250 Litres

The fish tank would be ~700-750 litres.

Sump will be able to hold approximately 300 litres of water, should the pump fail. I would hope that all growbeds will not be full at any given time, permitting a staggered ebb and flow. At least one sump barrel will grow duckweed for the fishies.

There would also be a SLO coming from the fishtank, going into the growbeds.

1351390350.0	1279ey	Details for my projected build, just wanted to run it by everyone	jakxfanatic	14	2	11	"System Design

1.	Picture http://backyardaquaponics.com/forum/download/file.php?id=18706

2.	Just replace the venturi piping with another pump in the fish tank, as the beds will be elevated for easier accessibility. 

3.	So the idea is to have the fish tank pump the water to the grow beds. At the same time, the sump tank will pump in water to the fish tank to keep the water level constant. Then, the grow beds will drain into the sump tank to settle the remaining sediment to the bottom and hold the excess water.

4.	Aerating the water from the sump tank stream, as it will be a heavy flow. Also, with the fish tank pump running to the grow beds; an overflow valve can further aerate the water.

Totes

1.	275 gal IBC totes

2.	1st for fish, with top foot cut off (makes a 200 gallon fish tank) 40 lbs. of fish.

3.	2nd for the 3rd and 4th grow beds.  Use the rest for possible fingerling tank.

4.	3rd for sump tank, use top for another grow bed (makes 2 total).

Grow Beds

1.	Max 40 cubic feet of grow bed space, based on 1 cubic foot per pound of fish.

2.	40 cubic feet yields 300 gallons of bed, growth media leaves about half volume for water (150 gal).

3.	4 grow beds from tote tops, ~10cubic feet each, 75 gallons each (~38 gallons of water, 150 total).

4.	Cycle all of the 225 gal of water in fish tank per hour, so ~1.33 cycles per hour, I want to use a slow fill rapid drain system so I was thinking of a 40 minute fill time then drain. This will run the 200 per hour through the beds.

Plumbing + Tech

1.	4 Bell siphons and their PVC materials.

2.	PVC pipe for plumbing ~100 feet + 30 joints for piping to fish tank and piping to grow beds.  It seems high but I want piping to go around perimeter of grow beds to evenly distribute water + sediment solids.

3.	2 Pumps at least 500 gph because of head height (one for fish tank and one for sump tank). With backups just in case of power failure.

4.	Aerator and water heating possibly necessary.

5.	Grow lights needed if indoors.

6.	Fishless cycling, so I need a cycling kit.

Costs 

1.	Well each tote will be used not new so that cuts costs. They are about $150 each.

2.	The pumps are available around $70 each on amazon depending on which brand is chosen. Backup pumps are another 50 or so.

3.	PVC for the piping and bell siphons is probably around 100 bucks at home depot.

4.	The grow bed media will probably be 1/3 hydroton or other expanded material and 2/3 gravel to save some money. It’s probably around 250 for the hydroton and I don’t know about the gravel but it is cheaper by far in comparison.

5.	The construction costs depend on your situation and if you need to build some tables to elevate the beds.  I will need it so that’s additional lumber costs.

6.	A cycling kit for a system this size is around $50.

7.	In total that’s around $1400. Now you might need extra aeration but I feel like the 2 overflows pumping into the fish tank is enough aeration. You also might need heating if outdoors and it gets cold and if it is indoors you also need grow lights.

Plants, Fish and Harvesting

1.	The final costs are for all of the plants and fish. For 40lbs. of fish it could be up to a couple hundred depending on type and initial size. For tilapia its probably $100 for 60 fingerlings that will grow to ~1lb each in the end.

2.	Plants can be bought for a couple $ each as seedlings, so at 40 cubic feet it can be upwards of 120 plants depending on how close you plant. That’s $180 per month, so $2150 more per year. 

3.	So every year it would cost ~2500 for the fish and plants.  Factor in electricity for pumps and grow lights (indoor system) at around 480 a year and the total is ~$3000.  Now a family of 4 uses around $300-400 per month for food, so on average $4200.  Obviously there will be some additional expenses (buy chicken, beef, grains) outside of the system but 30% savings isn’t bad.

4.	For harvesting fish, I believe that it takes tilapia around 16 weeks to reach 1lb. in weight though I might be wrong. That is 3 harvests a year of all 35 fish. Now I will obviously raise them in a way that I will harvest a few every 2 weeks to eat.

5.	The plants grow at a much faster rate.  For example if I just did lettuce they take on average 24 days to grow, so 12 harvests per year.

So does everything look ok, the ratios and pump needs met sufficiently?  The last thing is the type of media I was going to use.  I live in NY and was planning on using Hydroton (LECA), but couldnt really find a supplier.  If anyone knows of one shipping to NY that would be awesome.

EDIT: I added the costs portion and a little more info in what my plan is for all of the food."	t5_2rioe	True

There's been plenty of duckweed (roughly the area of two large pizzas) for the fish in the inside tank for a couple months.

I check on them daily.  Two days ago, overnight, they had suddenly eaten half of everything.  Yesterday, they ate most of what was left.  Today there's just a few scraps, not enough to fill a thimble.  (Luckily I had previously saved some for separate growing stock)

The outdoor system makes a lot of sense to me- free sunlight and no mess if something messes up and a tank spills.  However, I have a question about rain- when it rains, my tanks (and grow beds) are going to obviously fill up with rain water.  Keeping the level under control shouldn't be too hard with a good pump, but I'm worried about nutrients leaving the system.  Is this an issue?  Are there any resources that address this?

EDIT:  There's lots of good advice here, and the impression I'm getting is to just go for it, and it should be okay, but if not, adapt!  Summary of key points:

* Several people with experience haven't had any issues, so it will probably be okay
* Keep in mind that water will add to the top of a tank, and overflow will drain from the top, so nutrient loss may not be as bad as it looks from the amount of water loss
* If it does become a problem, rerouting the drains on and using a loose cover to keep out as much rain as I can are reasonable options on the tropical storm days.
* The things that control the nutrients (bacteria, fish), aren't leaving the system, so even if I do lose some nutrients, the system should be able to adjust."	t5_2rioe	True

I'd greatly appreciate your input.

For science,

notsoevilhost

Edit: Additional notes and research I've come across.

1. Siphons in general are powered by gravity and not air pressure (based on Bernoulli's principle) - [Context - pdf page 2](http://eprints.qut.edu.au/31098/25/A_practical_example_of_a_siphon_at_work_eprint_%282%29.pdf)

2. Larger the siphon size the stronger the vacuum [context - forum thread - must test this IRL](http://www.backyardaquaponics.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=12426)


Personal notes: 

* My interest has peaked in creating a stronger vacuum with the least amount of trouble. 
* I'm thinking about putting together a practical application test / video with data for this. If any of you want specific tests to be performed please let me know.

My first question is how to go about dechlorinating the water for the setup if I do add food fish? All the products I have used say not for use with fish intended for consumption.

And a budget bell siphon!	demonwhorants	16	5	7	"There seemed to be a decent amount of interest in my post a few days ago, so I thought I'd post an update. A busy weekend has seen the addition of a bell siphon, solids filter and most importantly fish to the aquaponic system.

**Bell Siphon**

Taking some advice from a conversation I had with someone on Reddit, I decided to add a bell siphon to my grow bed. Standing in the plumbing isle of a hardware store searching for parts, I took out my phone and checked the parts list I'd made. One last Google search? Why not!

This search saved me about €20. I found a number of bell siphons built from old plastic bottles - right in line with my cheap-o system design policy! I don't take any credit for the designs, I used [this one]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDzcKgWLRf0) for inspiration. I used 2 liter plastic bottle. My gravel guard is actually a cut up sock! A new one, of course. Hate feet.

**Solids Filter**

The final part before I added the fish was a solids filter. The lava lock does seem to break up a little and constantly shed little bits, and the fish are sure to make a mess. Using one of the cut up bottles from the siphon tests and a bit of fabric left over from the sock, I hooked up simple filter.

**Fish**

I picked up the boy from nursery and, as I promised him this morning as part of a deal to get him out the door, we went and got the fish! I got 7 goldfish, all pretty small, a couple of snails (I've heard mixed reviews, but I think they might help deal with any algae that grows) and a couple of aquatic plants which I am hoping will act as a buffer until the lettuce get going.

I've started growing some lettuce indoors in soil, and left some seeds to germinate in a zip lock bag. I also dropped a few seeds into one side of the grow bed, under around 1cm of grow bed medium. Somehow, someday soon, there will be lettuce in the grow bed!

I've been researching aquaponics for some months now, and am nearing my first cake-day as a avid Redditor. somehow it never occured to me to search for aquaponics on Reddit. ಠ_ಠ

So many new ideas...

 Anyway, today I did the first test-cycles on project AQ1, my alphanumerically named, low budget aquaponics system. As the more astute of you may have already guessed by the name that it is my first endeavor into the world of aquaponics. As it would happen, it is also my first attempt at any kind of gardening.

 AQ1 is built out of three Sterilite #5 plastic storage containers, sourced from the local Dollar General. Two grow beds are situated above a centrally located fish tank. A small fountain pump (way overkill in this case) feeds into the grow beds, which are set up with 1/2"" bell siphons.

 The fish are in the tank, the bell siphons are functioning well and I started germinating black eyed peas today. I still need to finish the inlet manifold and get some sort of growing media, but it is getting very close to being functional... aesthetics could still use a bit of improvement. I plan to finish it in ceder. I'll get some pictures up later...

In order to create a complete closed-loop system, while still effectively nourishing the plants and fish, I want to try and integrate a fish tank with a traditional soil grow bed.  

The growbed would be a wooden box, maybe 3' cubed.  The bottom of the box would slope from all sides down to a central drain point.  Plastic liner would be laid down (obviously with a drain hole int he middle of the bottom).  The lowest level would be filled with gravel up until the point where the slope in the bottom starts.  This gravel would level out, and then a short, fat, stump would be placed in the center (maybe 1.5' - 2' diameter and 1' high) flat sides up/down to serve as a water flow buffer, promoting drainage in wet conditions and holding water when the bed is dry.  around the stump would be placed smaller rotting logs and sticks along with subsoil, the wood getting smaller and more rotted as you rise.  Gradually, the fill will fade from mostly wood to mostly soil, and the final foot of space would be filled with loose topsoil and a few inches of compost mixed in at the top.  The bed would be planted and mulched generously.

The drain pipe would drop into a fish tank (actually two little bookshelf aquarium tanks that I have, which is a separate issue in and of itself), and be pumped back up over the bed intravenously, or pumped into a high point tank with a bell siphon that periodically flushes the plants.

Planting with buried wood is common in permaculture design as a way to increase water carrying capacity of the soil and provide plants nutrients as the wood rots.  A lot of people call it hugelkultur - http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/

Ideally, this would provide everything plants and fish would need to thrive, assuming fish feed is grown, which brings me to my next issue.

I want to grow fish food and algae... still figuring that out.  Let me know what you think so far."	t5_2rioe	True

1343757696.0	xgkka	Still trying to get my first system up and running, and have more newbie questions.	james39	15	3	6	"Hey there, you guys have been very helpful in my other posts, and I hope you will be willing to answer a few more of my questions.

As I stand right now I've got a tank, stand and growbed built. The tank is a 55g and the growbed is two 15 gallon barrels cut in half for a capacity of 30 gallons. The growbed is directly above the tank. For lighting, I have two 5 foot led tubes that are 5800K and put out 1500 lumens.

All of the above is recycled and was free, a theme I have been trying to stick with as my finances are extremely tight. I am willing to spend money on this, obviously it can't be totally free, but I've already blown a couple hundred bucks on plumbing screw-ups and am trying to keep the cost down from here on out.

I had intended to use a Fluval 305 I had laying around as a pump and additional biofiltration capacity; but it just can't handle the lift in the system; which I totally knew but somehow overlooked. So the first order of business is getting a pump picked out.

It's my understanding that I need about 230gph flow in this system, but I am having trouble finding the proper specs to determine what will achieve the 4.5' lift from the bottom of the tank to the top of the growbed at this rate. Also, I have concerns about which pump to use to insure that any nasty stuff doesn't get in to my water. I'd have to assume that with a cheap pump, this will be more of a concern.

Also, I still have the issue of substrate. Not being sure what I am going to grow, it is kind of difficult to decide. Is there any sort of good all-purpose material to use? I was thinking of using pea gravel or something similar. 

Finally, I have concerns about the lighting I am using. I don't know much about growing with LEDs and am not sure if the ones I got will be sufficient. I have a hookup on that if the ones I have are no good, but I don't know what I need to be looking for.

Thanks for your help!

The filter consisted of open-cell foam inside a piece of PVC with a sink strainer preventing the foam from pushing out. It worked well for about a week, but this morning the foam must have became clogged, pushing the press-fit input line (flexible tubing) out of the fitting it was in. 

With the line from the pump hanging over the side, and bright sunshine powering the pump at full speed, almost all my water (over 200 gallons) went onto the ground. At some point later, the tubing fell down into the tank. There probably would have been no water left at all when I arrived if not for this small bit of luck.

I had about 50 gallons in my duckweed tank to refill the tank part of the way so I didn't lose any fish, amazingly. 

So the moral of the story is: Be careful when tinkering with your system!"	t5_2rioe	True
1354232619.0	140t3w	Nitrite Spike? 1.5 months in? Am I interpreting the situation right?	guyanonymous	12	1	11	"Well, as of ~3 days ago, some of my trout (2 weeks old) started passing on.  There were no marks, the rest were active, etc.  

I wasn't worried at first, ammonia hadn't shifted, nor had pH, water temp was constant (more so than when they first arrived), and the water was far more clear than it was when they arrived.

I'd put them in about a week after getting through the ammonia spike portion of the cycling process.

As of today I've found a total of 8-9 dead (2 today on top, and 2 that were at least a couple days old on the bottom inside a large pvc pipe section I'd put down for them to hide in.  I found these two when I decided to clean out the bottom of the sump and main tank (55 gallon barrels) to make sure there wasn't something dead/gross/etc, down there. I decided at this stage to remove anything in the tank and could avoid being seen in (as corpses), and I've ordered some lights for down at the bottom to help me see better and check things out.

I did a bit more research convinced it wasn't an ammonia spike (the one I had triggered my ammonia sensor to shift obviously, while nothing has changed here, and my pH didn't really change during it); this time the ammonia is constant (as low as it's been since I put water in the system as far as I can tell on this sensor), but pH has risen from 7.2 to 7.6 in a day, and all of the fish have, over the last 24 hours or so, shifted to swimming lazily around the top of the tank.  

I believe all this matches the ammonia-&gt;nitrite bacteria moving in and next phase after ammonia-spikage, and I just have to wait for the nitrite-&gt;nitrate bacteria to appear.  Do you know how long that usually is?  

I did replace about 15-20 gallons with fresh water to help lower ppm and pH, and remove other accumulated wastes (I've only done ~15L every 3-5 days since starting the system before).  I also added sea salt, as recommended on a few forums, to my sump, and it's being pumped through the system now;  it was suggested on a few forums to aim for 1ppm sea salt which I hope I calculated right at ~1.5cups (~.7 lbs sea salt) in ~80-90 gallons system water.  It's supposed to help the fish cope with breathing in the nitrite rich water if I read things right.

I don't have a nitrite/nitrate test kit, and haven't had a chance to take water in to get tested / pick one up.  Since one's not really in the budget right now, I'd like to skip it if this is indeed all that's probably happening.

Any confirmation or corrections of my thought processes here would be much appreciated, especially with regard to the fish's health.

I can put them in a 5 gallon bucket with air going in for a couple days if that would help them - but just with fresh (soft, usually very low chlorine/ammonia except when city decides to do a big treatment) city water.

I intend to use 3/4"" plumbing from the tank to grow beds and 1"" plumbing back to the tank.  I will be using affnan-style auto siphons in the grow beds and ball valve tees for the grow beds to help regulate flow.

Since I'm doing this in my basement (I live in KY) this winter, I'm going to start small on my lighting by using the $10.97 light and ballast setup from Wal-Mart and see if they will be adequate.  I'm going to build some adjustable 'clothes racks' from PVC to hang the lights on.

I haven't decided on a pump, yet, but I'm sure it'll be a fairly inexpensive one.

I'm using expanded shale for my medium and I plan on putting about 8-10"" in each bed.

I'm pretty sure I won't be using a sump.

I'll probably use koi or goldfish to start, since they're pretty indestructible and it's getting colder here.

So, I decided it was up to me to make sure that she got the garden she so desired. There was just one catch...

we live in a desert; a bone dry desert that receives about as much rain in a year as most places receive on a slightly humid day, and she wants a lush green and verdant garden. I all but despaired. Until I stumbled upon this subreddit. However, find it I did.   

After perusing this subreddit, I determined that all I needed was a suitable pump and space for the tanks and grow beds and a little PVC. Well, space was not a problem, I have space galore out in my back yard, and for the grow beds, I have yards and yards of cinder block fence to mount them to. So I set out to acquire all that I would need. To begin with I found this polite looking little magnetic drive pump. It had a little one inch intake and output. 

Looking back, it was right there where I made my mistake. I assumed that just because it looked like a polite little pump it would be a polite little pump.    

I built my testbed system with the assumption that two one inch drains would be sufficient to deal with my little pump with its single one inch output. Nope, not even close. That little pump filled my vortex filter, and my sand filter and my physical media filter and the grow beds in a matter of just a few minutes. the drains didn't even begin to have a chance to deal with that kind of water output. Instead it all started to flow over the top. There was water going everywhere. (Have I mentioned how thankful I am that I decided to build my testbed system in the backyard instead of in my kitchen?) I had to pull the plug on everything once the water in my sump tank got to low and threatened to expose the pump's intake.

All this lead me to realize the aquaponicist's first rule: always make sure that the drains are sufficient to deal with the pump's output.  

Tl;dr: One should make sure that what they are building isn't actually a waterfall instead of a garden."	t5_2rioe	True

Link to images: http://imgur.com/a/Rer3H

EDIT: the new even simpler design, so far... http://imgur.com/a/zx9FT

This setup fits in a 4'x5'6"" floorspace.  It's designed to fit in my kitchen, and use sun from the E/SE, and to add lights down the road if necessary.  It's about 4'6"" at the top of the grow bed.

Please ignore my 'emergency flood' trays under everything...I'm just paranoid of leaks - they're basically plywood bases, 2x4 borders, and will be Blue Max (rubber coated). My shelves also stand on top of them to distribute the weight better and impact my ancient wood floors less.  Additionally, I'll have some matting underneath (80% recycled polypropylene fibres with gel foam backing) for additional protection against scuffing, minor unevenness and to further distribute the weight of the whole thing more evenly.

The top grow bed area is 4'x3'6""x12"".  I expect to have water filling that to ~10"" (where I hope my bell siphon will kick in), and for the bottom 2"" or so to remain full, so I need to send 8"" of water depth through on each flood cycle.   This works out to a space of ~60 gallons, but ~50% of that space will be filled with grow media, so I'm estimating a transfer of ~30 gallons each cycle of the ebb/flow.  I did already purchase a pump that can handle an 8' head in case I add a 2nd grow bed above this one down the road.

The extra glass aquarium there is where I'll put cherry shrimp/cray fish as well, since it's a free 30 gallon space a friend gave me.  

I will be trying to raise some cherry shrimp or crayfish througout the system as well.  I plan to involve them in the system wherever they'll fit will/survive for filtration/cleaning (they eat dead stuff - fish/worms-whatever too) as well as to use them as fish food (and sell/share with anyone I know who can use them, since around here the cherry shrimp go for $1-3 each).

________

**The water flow, starting at the sump:**

The lower blue tub is a 32 gallon container It is planned to be my sump/filter zone and depending on how water flow ends up, 

**Q. Should I put in any media in the base of this container?**  

**Q. Should my intake be at the top/middle/bottom of the tank if the tank is empty (or should that change if it has media in it)?**

The upper tub is the same size as the sump, and is where I plan to put a few koi.  I will try a couple cray fish here as well for cleaning up bottom-level waste (advice from koi pond folk).

1. I picked up (~60% off ), a recently discontinued(replaced) [Little Giant mag drive pump](http://www.rcworst.com/little-giant-pes-1000-pw-1150-gph-15-cord-mag-drive-pond-pump/) that, I know, is more powerful than I need, but it is adjustable, and I've been led to understand that reducing the size of the outflow pipe won't harm the pump, and will allow me to further adjust the flow, though I'm more inclined to just add a diverter and get even more aeration somewhere in the system (probably right back into the fish tank?).  The rise of the pipe from the pump is 4', and the sum of the piping run from there is ~10', which I've been told ads 1' to the 'head' value. At 5-6' head, the pump I picked up can push through 650GPH or so (overkill), but as said, I'll adjust this down via the controls and/or outflow pipe size.  I decided to go with this one because it can handle a head of over 10' if I decide to add another level.

**Q. Are pump bags recommended, or unnecessary with this type of pump and in this environment? (removable impeller, no other moving parts).**

**Q. If I'm calculating 4-6 flow cycles / hour (is that a reasonable number, or too much?) for ebb/flow, that works out to ~120-180GPH.  If I'm understanding right, reducing the 1"" outfeed pipe to 1/2"" piping, would reduce flow to ~1/4 of the original flow, which would bring me down to ~125-175GPH (depending on pump setting, real output, actual head in the end) which should work well. Is this correct?**

2. The water is pumped up ~4' and into that distribution system I setup.  I realize I could just have it end in one corner and go from there. I am thinking/hoping that this will let the water reach more areas of the bed with more ease, and reduce the chance of anaerobic zones.  

**Q. Will I see a benefit from this type of distribution?**

**Q. What are the pro's/con's of outflow release at different levels of the grow-bed?  At the top, it'll drop through, getting further aeration, but will it really 'flow' along the bottom layer and break up those anaerobic areas?**

3. The grow bed itself has two drains.  One is an emergency overflow drain; the other is a bell siphon.  I plan to make the emergency overflow drain out of 1"" PVC (with a screen over the grow-bed end to keep grow-media out), and it feeds straight down to the fish tank (ending an inch or two above the max water level).  The bell siphon will have a 'top level' (upper water level) at 10"" in the grow bed, and a lower 'no-drain' level of 2"". 

**Q. For the bell siphon, I'll be following the 2:1 size ratios - but I'm not trusting my interpretation of recommended sizes for flow.  What do you recommend for this setup to let ~30Gallons drain each cycle (quick enough for the ebb flow)?  What size (diameter) piping should I go with for this?  I'm thinking of standpipe, bell siphon, and 'protective cage'.**

4. From the bell siphon (and the emergency overflow in worst case), the water is gravity fed back to the fish barrel.  The fish barrel will normally be covered, at least 50% with a panel that allows the pvc through; I'll likely have the from 50% covered with clear acrylic  to let those fish get some light, but not jump out.  These will also reduce splashing. The fish tank has an overflow drain (height to be determined, but I'm thinking ~2/4 of the way up the container) which connects directly to the sump area. I was going to use 1"" PVC with some screens on each end (maybe endcaps w/ drilled holes)?.  I am considering adding an airstone or two to various areas of the system, just in case a bump fails, the fish/other critters will still get oxygen.

**Q. Is 2"" enough of a drop for aeration here, or should I be doing something else? Turning the final elbow sideways? Rotating it 180?** 

**Q. Should the overflow into the sump area be drawing water from the bottom/middle/top of the fish tank?** 

**Q. Do I even need to have this tank raised above the sump? If I put the overflow at the top of each barrel, it seems to me that things will still work the way I need, but I'm having a brain-fart on this and would like confirmation or correction of my thought.**

5. The water from the fish tank overflow should end up back in the sump. Depending on the level I position my overflow at in the fish tank, the fish tank level will rise/fall by 10 gallons or so each cycle, so the fish will have 15-20 gallons all the time at worst.  If you folks confirm (above) that putting these on the same level, rather than having the fish tank raised, is fine, I'll go that way and with the following plan (if not, I'll have to refigure and am open to suggestions - a 50 gallon tank is an option).

________

My plan for total water volume to make sure nothing floods, but enough water cycles through:

a. Start the system with the grow bed full of media to the 11.5"" level, and water to the 2"" level (the no-drain level); ~30 gallons in each of the fish/pump barrels (connecting overflow from fish/sump zone is ~2/3 of height of both barrels.

b. turning on pump in sump/filter barrel, will move 30 gallons up to the grow bed, but 10 gallons or so of that will be replaced from the fish tank, so the pump will always have 10 gallons of so of water in that  The fish tank will lower to 15-20 gallons (depending on overflow level).  

c. As the grow bed fills, and the bell siphon kicks in, the 30 gallons should quickly drain back to the fish tank, which should equally quickly overflow back into the sump, (10 gallons remaining in the fish, 20 flowing into the sump). If the bell siphon fails, 1/2-1"" above it is the emergency overflow for the grow bed, so another 5 gallons may end up up-top, but it'll drain back to the fish tank, and sump then, and the pump won't end up dry as there'll always be 5 gallons or so there.

**Q. Am I understanding/planning this right? Feedback is good - I'd sooner correct my faulty calculations/understanding now, than down the road.**


**Q. *Another option for the aquarium use, though, is for me to put it up top toward one edge/the back of in the grow bed; in that case I'd either outflow right into it, with water hyacinth/water lettuce growing there (more food sources/awesome filtration), and let the water just overflow into the grow beds.  I could also, in this case, put a tower above for strawberries etc. which dripped straight into the filter/tank* Do you have any feedback about this idea? Any problems you could see arising?  I'd paint/cover the sides facing the window (the top 3-4"") to reduce algal growth.**

I've got an empty room in the basement and would like to get a system up and running by winter so that I can continue getting fresh food. My only issue is that, as lame as it is to say so, I am broke as all hell. 

Through trolling the Craigslist free section, I have come up with lots of fish tanks and pumps, so that end is pretty much covered. 

I can build the stands and growbeds myself, and have a fair amount of scrap lumber.

The plumbing shouldn't be an issue, though it will be an expense.

My two main concerns cost-wise are the lighting and the grow bed liners.

Any tips on getting some lighting going for a reasonable cost? From looking at hydroponics suppliers, I can't believe what these cost. Obviously the LED systems are unobtainable, and I would prefer to avoid HPS or MH because of the heat involved. It's a small room and those lights would cook it pretty quickly. So, all that's left is fluorescent. Do I need anything special, or could I scrounge some used fixtures from somewhere?

Also, for the liner, is there any cheap option while keeping it safe chemically? I guess I have the same question regarding substrate as well.

In our village of Dúbravica (center Slovakia), the small river stopped running since a couple of days. We went up the flow because people told us might be a hole in the other village that would be taking all the water into subterranean caves (we could find some, but this shouldn't be the only reason). We believe that the fact they cut many trees around the river last spring is causing the water to evaporate faster.

On the way, we found many, many crayfishes and locals told us is a very rare situation. They say about 20 years ago was common to see them (among many other species). Is there anything we can do for save the few we've seen before they die for lack of oxygen / water or for the locals that collect them for eating?

Or maybe... is this normal? Are we probably overreacting? (we almost had a fight with some people that came to collect them). We found out that crayfishes are protected by Slovak law. Also, a few minutes before I'm sending this, the water came back (they covered the holes).

Can maybe someone share a link to ways to organize farms to preserve their existence and responsible consume?

Also, as you might notice, with the lack of water all the litter just came more evident. We want to organize some cleaning brigades and ask for help to the boy scouts group. But the crayfishes are first.

Details are left out because I suck at sketchup, but the gist of this is an aquaponic/NFT rig fit into my windowsill.  The fish tank will sit below (20-25 gallons) and will have 2-3 goldfish.  Hopefully these fish can support 18-25 plants (am I being realistic here?)  These plants will all be lettuce and spinach because my window is north facing (although I'll be supplementing with a small flourescent, and I have a metal halide if I absolutely need it).

The window section (left section in the picture) will have plastic wrap on the edges to keep it a little more humid and warm and the back section will have reflective material (on cardboard standees of leonardo dicaprio and carey mulligan to keep my cat out).

One big question I have for experienced NFTers-- should I pipe water to all 5 tubes individually (straight from the tub?) or is it enough to simply have the water run through all five in progression? (the reason for their zig-zag slantedness)

**Option B**: Pumice stone called Bora-tsuchi, from a volcano called Mount Kirishima.  It's PH is listed as between 5-6.

**Option C**: Marble-sized compacted clay pebbles called Akadama.  It has a PH of 6.5.  I think this is the winner, but the pebbles seem kind of soft!

1348633412.0	10hpcx	2 55 Gallon barrels, 4 ~25 gallon tubs (~10-12 gallons each /cycle), and some shelves.  How should I plumb?  	guyanonymous	12	3	5	"http://i.imgur.com/LbNmS.jpg

I've got my containers, I've got my space set aside...now how should I plumb things?

Currently, my plan is:

1. Pump in sump zone sens water up, with lines leading to all 3 grey tubs, (splitting off main branch), and one branch leading back to fish tank; each line has a valve on it to adjust flow as necessary.

2. Tray 1 has an auto-bell siphon straight down to the fish tank 

3. Tray 2 has a bell siphon exiting the side of the tray at a right angle right into the fish tank.

4. Tray 3 (below tray 2) does the same as tray 2. This is the only tray not filled with media - it'll be a raft setup.

5. Tray 4 (bottom left tray) has an overflow into the fish tank just above the 'overflow' drain level from the fish tank back to the sump

6. overflow from fish tank (just below level of tray 4's exit) - this overflow will be via a larger diameter pipe (I was thinking 1.5""?) so that the fish will never risk overflowing. I think this will keep the fish tank at a fairly constant level, with only the sump significantly falling and rising.

I'll start the system with the fish tank  sump full to the level of the shared overflow, with only the bottom 2"" of water in tray 1, 2, and 3 and tray 4 full to the overflow level; if there's just over 30 gallons, at least, in the sump, that should allow me enough water to pump up, through, and have wash back into the fishtank then to the sump without the pump going dry etc.

note: I have mats under it all, the wood at the bottom everything is resting on is cedar, and it should, I hope distribute the weight of the shelf unit and contents; there are also 3/4"" foam mats under the wood the barrels are on, again to distribute weight and provide some extra protection for the 100 year old wood floors in my old place.  I've kept things raised on the wood so moisture on the outside of containers isn't in contact with the floor or hidden and airflow can help keep things dry (short of floods).

Now...how would you do this instead? What's wrong with my setup - I'm sure there are several things.

I was planning on 1"" tubing leading up to the tanks (my pump is 1150 GPH w/ a head using 1"" pipe of ); I'm not sure if I need to go 1"" for the bell siphons or if 1/2"" is sufficient - and for these, of course, I'd use PVC.  

Here's a blank shot for you to use if you're inclined to draw:  http://i.imgur.com/zf6qF.jpg ; just call the grey barrel the fish tank, the blue the sump, and the bins 1,2,3,4 counterclockwise from the one on the barrels.

Thanks again for the feedback - now that the containers I could get are here, it's time for this to become real. :D

I have a 3 IBC set up that I plan on expanding with at least another IBC cut in half for a total of 5 grow beds. Aside from that, I want to start working on some prototypes so in short, I need room to expand. 

We don't have the money to do a concrete slab but I figure we can strap the thing to the fish tanks for anchors. 

How big would you go? What materials would you use to keep costs down? I'm thinking wood/corrugated plastic will get the job done but I don't know how tall to make it. Would love to get a banana tree going. How much is too much/not enough ventilation? It would be in full sun for at least 10hrs a day if we placed it on the southwest part of the property. Probably around 5 hours of direct if we put it on the southeast side where the trees would block the morning sun. 

Are there any free plans out there for just basic rectangular green houses? We want to do chickens also so thinking about doing a coop off one side of the greenhouse. Is that a good/bad idea? 

can't really ask any more specific questions other than that because I don't know wtf I'm doing yet. So anywhere you could point me would be great. Thanks. 

**edit:** When I said doing an attached chicken coop I meant that we are interested in getting chickens and that building the coop into the structure would be cool if it were possible.

The plan is to have a relatively small garden; 
100m2 of growbeds, 4x 3000l fish tanks
in a geodesic dome

Why such a small garden? I want it small enough so that one worker can keep it running and because my main selling point will be that not a drop of oil was used for the salad that the costumer will have on his/her table, it will be delivered by a tricycle (with quite a bit of cargo space). 

The business model is a bit funny. I won't really be selling vegetables and fish, but renting out parts of the garden. It will be in the biggest city in my country (Slovenia) and people will rent ""holes"" per month, having their produce delivered when they decide. It will be much easier to rent out a smaller garden and it keeps the ""radius"" of delivery to a normal level so that I will be able to do the delivery by the cargo bicycle.

But one thing is for sure, I'm not a biologyst, I don't have any experience in producing food, so any advice will be worth its weight in gold if it saves me trouble down the road.

Just brainstorming here and realized that if you where trying to produce a yield for animals you'd have a lot more plants 'n fish to choose from.

1361000122.0	18mnl5	Our first aquaponics set up is now done, however I have a question. 	Pandoraexpress	10	1	10	"We have set ours up with a loop syphon, and we timed the entire flood and drain at about 7 minutes (5 to fill grow bed, and 2 to drain) that is a pretty short span of time, so I am wondering if I need to set my timer on my pump to start every 7 minutes or just have it run a certain number of times a day. Some feedback would be greatly appreciated.

1360526849.0	189fxo	Some guidance and advice would be great!	beetlez	13	1	6	"I'm helping to build up the food supply on a remote island in Indonesia, we're currently planning to implement some more permaculture ideas over the next year and have had the idea suggested to us that aquaponics might be the answer for lettuce and greens crops.

The island is 22 acres, there is a shallow well in the middle of it that is pumped to cisterns for tap water, and there's filtered rain catch for drinking water.  The well is newer as the older one became slightly salty.

The issues I'm considering are that we don't want to have any standing water that may increase the mosquito population. Malaria is endemic to the region, but since we're all healthy and the village of locals is far enough away, this island is quite safe (we don't take anti-malaria meds)  There's been lots of attention given to mosquito control in practices like turning over coconut husks and shells as to not provide a pool of rainwater and breeding grounds, there are fewer mosquitoes here than in Hawaii even, and I worry about changing that. 

I've been thinking perhaps we could construct something close to the well, so the water temperature is at it's lowest.  I wonder if stocking the reservoir with fish that eat mosquito larva is something anyone has tried with success?

Also curious of what the ideal water temperature is for growing lettuce at the equator?

If anyone has experience with a similar situation or has links to info they've read on a project like this, I would so appreciate some input.

Thanks in advance!

Well, things are a growing now...more and more is coming up. Some of the changes and issues the last while:

1. I've hit the nitrite spike point I believe.  My ammonia is steady, my pH has gone up, temp is constant...but fish are suffering and dying again (ARG!).  I'd missed this issue when researching somehow.  If I'm interpreting my situation right now (please correct me if I'm not), I believe that the ammonia-&gt;nitrite bacteria have moved in, but the nitrite-&gt;nitrate (the good stuff) have not.  I'm down ~50% of my trout - but this may also have to do with my water temp.

2. Water temp: I have accepted that if I'm hitting 19-20.5 in the winter, I'm likely to go up in the summer...not good temps for trout.  I'm going to consider other fish now...any suggestions for 18-26 fish that are hardy, not as dirty as goldfish - and cheap (edible is nice, but not an issue for me)?

3. I added a pump and some simple plumbing to my blue mini-recycling bin greenhouse and have it running ~12 hours a day (bottom 2-2.5"" filled with water all the time) with it entering the growbeds via my improvised 'strawberry tower', trickling down, and then exiting the system via overflow out the pvc 'copper/red handled' garden taps.  I'm experimenting with water temp since fish aren't an issue. The temperature in the room ranges from 18-22 during the day, and inside the greenhouse (depending on water temp I set on an aquarium heater) from 24-28 after the lights come on.  It's not too humid in there yet...knock on wood :D

4. I redid my lettuce raft bin....I think it's 21 small baskets now, but instead of the water reaching the top of the baskets (basically only leaves above water most of the time), the top of the hydroton/baskets is ~2-3"" above the water line and only the bottom .5-1"" of the baskets are in the water at all times.  I also adjusted the drain inside my barrel to raise the water level ~1-1.5"".  Between those two things, the top of the baskets are about 3"" closer to the lights at all times which is good.  Already the limp lettuce I had before is perking up and looking better (4-5 days?)

5. A few things were moved around on the window shelves, 3 of the gourds are coming up already, but not too much else so far (I think the rest is my attempt at bonsai tree, no other 'veg/fruit' stuff).

6. I'm passing the aerogrow thing on the fridge on to a friend who is very excited.  It's been working for some things (don't have the rockwool right into the water!), but since it's not based on a 'hydroton' sort of setup, it's not feeling a good fit. She's happy and I'm happy.

7. I got some small 3v pumps (40cm head tops) for ~$6 shipped on ebay; I am trying them in a mason-jar-strawberry-tower setup (on one of the window shelves), as well as using one in my 2 gallon (?) tank where I've got the pregnant cherry shrimp and aquatic blackworms (still alive and active after a week!) that I'm trying to breed.  So far so good! (no pics of the last one right now, but I'll share some pics and video soon).

8. I also finished setting up a 'seed exchange' for my apartment which a couple people are already using.

I hope some of this is interesting to people beyond me. Feel free to ask any questions or provide feedback.

DKroner	12	3	4	"So I originally had a turtle tank that I used when I set up my first aquaponics set up for shits and giggles.  There were 2 red eared sliders that I caught in the wild when they were about the size of a quarter each and they were about 3 years old when I let them go where I caught them earlier this fall.  

The water from their tank was the water I used in my aquaponics set up and the water I used when watering my dirt potted plants in the room as well.  

Right now there are a handful of goldfish in the system and that is is.  

Am I going to have to bleach everything/toss it and buy new gear if I want to grow things to eat in the future or will any potential salmonella from the turtles die out on its own over time with no animal hosts? Could it survive indefinitely in the goldfish alone? What if I got ride of the goldfish and had just water for a while?

If I can clean everything, what is the best way to go about doing so?

1. Would a large (95L/100Qt) Coleman cooler by safe to use (chemically/light/structural stability) as a fish tank?

2. What amount of water is it safe to take from the fish tank (a proportion such as 1/4?) at most to keep the fish unstressed/healthy while servicing the grow bed area?

Here's the system ...  one fishtank that's 160 gallons, 2x4 framed and fully insulated to help regulate water temperature.  Sides and bottom are insulated and the top will be mostly insulated once I build it. 

I have two 1/2"" SLOs as the primary overflows with an additional 1"" overflow as a ""just-in-case.""  then I have a 1/2"" inlet line to pump water into the fish tank.  I bought a 600 or so gph pump from harbor freight.

I just build the first of three 4'x4' grow beds.  12"" deep.  They will auto siphon to 35 gallon barrels beneath the grow beds.  There will be probably 4 or 5 35 gallon barrels plumbed together with one having the fountain pump in it to pump water back into the fish tank.

I plan to add a duckweed grow area to feed the fish, and red worms for in the growbeds.  And for a worm compost thing I plan to build later on.  Wife isn't liking that one very much.  she's still not happy about the aquaponics either.  And eventually I plan to experiment with a possible floating raft box, strawberry tower and maybe a few other things. 

Siphons will be 1"" stand pipes using Affnan's designs.  

My biggest concerns are whether or not my plumbing sizes are adaquate and whether having the pump in the sump feeding the tank to gravity feed to the grow beds is a good idea or not. 

I'd attach a picture of the fish tank, but I don't know how.  Sorry.

Written by a beginner.

Basics

Aquaponics gets its name from and is a combination of two sciences. These sciences are aquaculture and hydroponics.

Hydroponic growing is the science of growing plants without soil. It is most commonly seen in three forms, deep water culture (DWC), media beds, or nutrient film technique (NFT). There are endless variations and many systems combine the different forms.

Aquaculture is the science of raising marine or freshwater animals in some sort of controlled environment. To understand how and why these sciences are merging to form the new specialization we call aquaponics we must first understand the major problems associated with these sciences.

In traditional hydroponics plants are grown in a nutrient solution manufactured to maximize the growth of that plant. This nutrient solution is traditionally made up of fertilizers that are manufactured from oil and high in salts. This makes them expensive and the salts that are not absorbed by the plants accumulate until they become phytotoxic. The response to this problem for traditional hydroponic growers is to drain and flush the system. If the system is a media based system, the salts accumulate heavily in the media. In order to flush the salts out of the media it takes roughly 3 times the volume of the media bed in clean water drained to waste in order to remove the salts. That salt rich water rinsed from the hydroponic system must be disposed of responsibly.

Aquaculture encounters a similar problem with waste accumulation becoming toxic to the system. Fish continually produce ammonia (and urea). It comes out of their gills when they breath, and they excrete it like any animal excretes waste. This ammonia becomes toxic over time, and like the hydroponic salts, must be removed from the system. Aquaculturists employ elaborate filtration systems to minimize the amount of water used, however they cannot escape the need to drain waste heavy water from their system and replace it with clean water. Again, as in hydroponics, this waste must be disposed of responsibly. That means paying to have it removed.

So now that we understand the problems we can look at how combining the industries benefits each of them. Rather than waste and replace water, aquaponics recycles water. In a well balanced system roughly 1.5% of the system water volume will need to be replaced daily. Aquaponic systems have no weeds and the water surfaces are covered to minimize the amount of evaporation. That means almost all of that 1.5% of water that is being replaced daily is being used by the plants. Nothing more, nothing less. That water efficiency is what I believe is the most important aspect of aquaponics.

    Also, aquaponic systems are inherently organic, even if the government has a copyright on that word. A well established aquaponic system is a well established ecosystem. The larger the system, the older it is, the more well balanced and stable it will be. That stability is based on a complex ecosystem of life that includes not only the fish and the plants but also the bacteria that do the work of converting the ammonia, or fish waste, into nitrogen, our essential element to plant growth.

    If you are interested in more information about aquaponics, I can recommend a number of places to start. I would caution that when researching aquaponics be wary of the difference between being ‘loud’ and being correct. By that I mean there are a lot of people on the internet saying a lot of things, and just because they say it a lot doesn't make it true. As a young field, there is a lot of information out there. What I have found is that if you want to get to the bottom of something, you have to really ask the right questions and figure it out yourself. There is no substitute for actually building a system and trying to grow plants. Plant them, move them, eat them. Eat them some more. Eating them is awesome.  

Additional learning?
    The internet is obviously a great place to start. These are personal recommendations of mine based on personal experience.

http://www.reddit.com/r/aquaponics
http://www.aquaponicscommunity.com
http://www.aquaponics.net.au/

Youtube should get special mention. There are thousands of videos out there on every subject you can think of. I found Murray Hallam’s videos to be some of the best.


Want to read a real book?

1. http://www.amazon.com/Recirculating-Aquaculture-M-B-Timmons-Ebeling/dp/0971264627

2. http://www.amazon.com/Aquaponic-Gardening-Step-By-Step-Vegetables-Together/dp/086571701X

If you “look inside” on this book on amazon you can read most of the text for free.    

More of the hands on type? Build something! Nothing can substitute for doing it yourself. Find an aquaponic or hydroponic farm and get a job. Experience on a commercial farm will be beneficial in a variety of ways, even if its not directly related to your individual end goal. After that seminars and trainings are a popular way to become educated on aquaponics. As a professional I’m not going to personally recommend or warn against any of these. I caution anyone considering a training to consider your source and judge the cost to you against the value of your own time. It may be worth it to you to pay for a 3 day training rather than 3 months on the internet. You’ll probably spend that time on the internet anyway, however you’ll be more directed.

Many people offer unpaid internships in places like Hawaii. I participated in one of these and would caution against them. Be sure you know what you are getting into before you go. There are a few that will actually pay interns, use this as a sign.

If you are really serious about aquaponics work somewhere or go to school. All the people doing research and the most successful people are scientists, MBA’s, engineers, and doctors. Use aquaponics as a tool to figure out what really interests and motivates you, and go to school for that. It will lead to bigger and better things!

I'm in the beginning stages of planning for an aquaponics system. I have a basement space that would be ideal for my purposes (underutilized, unfinished and could get dirty but is also uninsulated). The thing is, the temperature in that room ranges from 45 F in the winter to about 70 F in the summer. I've read a lot about the ideal temperature for a system being around 70 F degrees and that most fish and vegetables like the temps around that. How strict is that? Do any of you have successful systems where the temperatures drop lower?

I could always get a heater going in the room, if necessary, but it would be great not to have to burn through the $$ heating the room if I could just adapt the system in some way. Curious to hear everyone's thoughts. Thanks!"	t5_2rioe	True

I'm looking at setting up a not-small AP system in my basement for the purpose of growing herbs for profit.

I was initially thinking that Metal Halide lights were the way to go as they give the best lumens/watt, and electricity is going to be my biggest monthly expense.  But other posts on this subreddit have me questioning whether it might be overkill for herbs, and maybe I can get away with T5s and have just as good growth with less overall electricity expenditure.

2.  Can anyone recommend a good yet cheap HPS light? Are cooling fans necessary for HPS Bulbs below 1000W?

I would like to say that I am a complete aquaponics noob and have *no* experience with it, but I am doing research into using it as a means of doing large scale sustainable gardening. Some questions:

*  Are there general rules about ratios between fish/plants/gallons of water to follow?
*  Does it make more sense to have one large tank feeding the entire system, or break it up into smaller tanks?
*  Suppose I have several plant beds... should each one be hooked up to the tank separately, or could the water follow a path from the tanks through all of the plant areas before going back to the tank? I suppose with this method it would mean the plants at the end of the water loop would get a lot less nutrients.
*  Can the basic ""tilapia+plants"" setup be expanded indefinitely, or as the scale goes up would it make more sense to attempt to create a more natural ecosystem with several species of fish and feeder plants?
*  Does it make more sense to have one large connected ecosystem, or break it down into smaller, distinct ones? I worry that if the entire thing was connected, nutrient deficiencies/surpluses, or disease outbreaks could ruin an entire harvest, but if it was done on the basis of many smaller setups, an event like the one mentioned would only threaten the plants in that specific setup.
*  What other resources have you found helpful in setting up your aquaponics systems?

1351701143.0	12elew	Goldfish die off - question...	guyanonymous	9	0	19	"I had 4 (out of originally 6) goldfish happily living away in my indoor setup.  They were all feeder goldfish, so fairly inexpensive.  From what I gather, having 2/6 die in the first couple days after transfer isn't unusual.

I decided on the weekend, ~two weeks after adding those first fish, to add more goldfish.  I picked up another 10 feeder goldfish from the same place.

Now, 4 days later, almost all of those have died off, and 2 of my originals that were bigger and healthier and active have died as well. I have 5 in there now...

What should I investigate?  What should I be worried about? 

They're in a 55 gallon barrel, filled to about 35 gallons, which shares water via an overflow with a 55 gallon sump filled to the same level.

Water temp was ranging from 16.5-20 (night to day), but now is at 18-22 (heat in building got cranked).  I have air going into the fish barrel 24hours a day, and it cycles with the rest of the system's 4 grow beds (about 90 gallons of water total in system).  pH has stayed constant around 7.2 and my &lt;cheap&gt; ammonia sensor hasn't changed at all in the entire time.

Edit: well, 5 survive, 3 in a small 1 gallon I had around, and 2 in the main tank, all seemingly doing fine (not floating or sinking)...fingers are crossed it was indeed an ammonia deal.

What next?

I have 20 trout fry showing up soon (this weekend or next I hope), and want to give them a good start in the system.  Should I be removing all the goldfish completely?

Edit: The two fish I left in the tank are still doing fine, and the three transplants were fine where they were (a very small tank though), and are now fine back in the main tank (so far)...temperatures are down (rads in the kitchen now off, windows open), and feeding far less.  And well, 5 is only 1 more than 4.  I was wise to stop naming the fish.  Remorse for the 9 dead is ... minimal.

Ermagherd, so I just found out about these sweet setups! Prior to this, I have been using my wastewater from my RODI unit, and some rain barrels to grow a vegetable garden out back. I have a mag 7 in my garage as well as a 100g Rubbermaid tub and TONS of PVC. I was talking to a friend of mine today who has 7 300g Rubbermaids left to sell. I was planning on using the 100 and a 300. I'd like to make a pond in the backyard with these, and then hook them up to an aquaponics garden. 

My main concern is how to make sure the nutrients in the water reach all of the plants instead of the ones right by the inlet soaking up all the ""good stuff"".  

With 300g of backbone, how much food can I grow? Enough to feed a family of four? 

Would a mag7 suffice, or do I need to go larger?

Any websites out there with some good info? 

Can I grow any vegetable in this stuff? Won't it drown out certain types of veggies?

I had originally planned on using a 100gal Rubbermaid container as my tank, but they're about $100, and I realized for that price I could get an entire IBC. Now I'm looking into IBC designs, trying to decide what's best for a beginner. Any specific design ideas, pics, or photos would be greatly appreciated!

I'm going to stack them like everyone else, using wood to support the bed underneath. There are 2 main areas I'm worried about:

1) I want to be sure and give extra support the cage around the grow bed. I've see people add a square wooden frame that attaches to the metal arms (that were cut to get it apart). Is this pretty easy? Not sure if that was the best description. 

2) The seal. What's the best way to get my drain hole installed and sealed? I have a uniseal, but it's only 1 1/4"", probably too small for this. What size drain hole should I have?

Past those, I'm pretty much ready to go.

Planned setup for my system: 
  * Flood/Drain Grow-bed setup with Bell siphons.
  * Grow-Beds &amp; Sump Tank will be indoors, while the fish tank is outside. (Which can create some major headaches about which fish to use, but I just don't have space for all of it indoors currently.)
  * Planning on using expanded clay for my growing medium. 

1: I have had the following tank hiding in my yard and want to use this as my fish tank. [Tank](http://imgur.com/a/XhaTm) I have no idea on how much water this holds, but should be in the 350+gal range I believe. With it being white plastic and it living outside, I'm going to 'assume' that I'll need to have it covered/shaded due to it being white plastic to prevent excessive algae growth. 

2: Currently I am looking at using approximately 3 barrels cut in half for my grow beds along with 3 - 6' Strawberry style towers. On the grow beds I'm shooting for 4 exchanges an hour, with the pump overflow going to the towers to run continuously. 

3: I just don't know if 100g is going to be big enough for my Sump tank or not for this system. (Haven't found anything online for coming up with a good size for this yet.) 

4: I live in Northern Utah, and I'm debating between Trout and Tilapia. Weather can reach low 100's-f during the day and 70's-f at night during the summer, and -10-f during the day and -30-f at night. I'm leaning towards trout as they handle the cold and temperature changes better, although I would have to worry about keeping the water cool in summer. Tilapia have the inverse problem, but as far as I understand, are much less tolerant of temperature changes.

Then i Decided I'd like to start a little smaller and just cut the top off to make a single barrel system. 

I made a bell valve and its working great. now I have a couple of questions before I get my fishies and start planting.

firstly this is basically what my system looks like. 
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kiwWdODqX6M/TJRxG3wDRvI/AAAAAAAAC3U/KpT3mLTFW-A/s1600/Single+Barrel+Aquaponics+1.jpg

except i havent cut a hole in the fish tank, instead ive made a frame to sit the grow bed on top. 

1. once I get the clay balls washed and installed I will cycle the system for a few days, but then im not sure what comes next. put the fish in to build up nitrates/fertiliser etc for a few days/weeks..? or put some plants in and cycle with some nutrients/seasol before installing the fish?

2. is there anything i can put at the bottom of the growbed, I was thinking water filled water bottles, or bricks/rocks. I think its about 25cm deep and I likely will be growing lettuce/spinach etc firstly, and would prefer to save as much money on clayballs as i can, as long as i dont need the full depth of the grow bed. (I know I could always make the stand pipe / bell valve shorter, but with the tank adaptor I got I cant make it too much shorter)

3. I cut the barrel approx 1/3 - 1/4 of the way down. and Im wondering how many fish I can keep safely. I believe I can add another growbed too allow more fish, though in this system im likely not going to be keeping eating fish, so max numbers aren't important. Ill likely buy 5-10cm goldfish. was thinking about 5-6?

4. What are the ideal timings for a bell valve/pump fill, or pros/cons of fast v slow fill and fast v slow drain. 
-at the moment it takes about 5 mins to drain, but that is because the pump is quite fast, i need to divert some water straight back into the fish tank for continues aeration. 

5. I have a digital PH meter, what PH am I looking at, and is this mainly to keep the fish happy or the plants happy?

6. Id love to eventually put some worms in the growbed, would you need flyscreen or shadecloth around the gravel guard to keep them out of the bell valve / standpipe, or just cover the standpipe (should I cover the standpipe anyway to keep out stray clay balls)

Anything else a first timer usually overlooks.

1363501669.0	1agc6p	New at aquaponics	ZeusLightning	8	0	2	"Hey, 

I have been gardening for awhile, and I decided that I would like to try an aquaponic system. I am going to start off small, probably a 20-50 gallon system first.

I know how the system is going to be designed, but what I am confused about is some of the numbers when bringing the system up, since pretty much all the resources I looked at had different opinions. Here are the numbers that I was able to come up with...


When starting cycling (Trying fishless first)
keep the ammonia levels at about .5 ppm until the nitrites get to about .5 ppm. Once that happens, then half the amount of ammonia that I am putting in the system. Once the nitrates get to above 5 ppm, then stop putting ammonia in the system. Once the ammonia gets to about zero, then put in the fish and plants... does that sound correct?


Some other numbers that do not deal with cycling.

~6 gallons of water for one cubic feet of growing

~1 lb of fish per 7.5 gallons

~keep ph level 6-7

~rotate the amount of gallons you have in your system about 1 per hour

I am working on the materials now but the basic measurements are: 250 G FT (start half filled), 6x3' GB (135 G), 1"" autosiphon and GB outlet, 3/4"" no-kink GB hose inlet?, NFT: 8' max height, 8.5 ft length, 3' width? (needs sturdy foot support), 1/2"" tubing up, 1/4"" tubing to channels"	t5_2rioe	True
1356963197.0	15q29t	My family and I want to switch our diet to mostly homegrown micro greens and sprouts!	papagert	12	4	6	Does anyone have any experiences or commentary they can give in relation to the title. We have a hydroponics apparatus made of PVC, with all the lamps and pumps needed, ready to go! We are waiting to buy seeds and more supplies until after I (plug) sell my e-drum set and buy a cabinet to house everything. How did you grow micro greens? What flow systems can work because I only see posts of flatbeds with clay pellets for greens and sprouts, but mine has 40 holes drilled into 4 water tunnels?	t5_2rioe	True
1356933000.0	15pmc2	Where to begin...		9	1	10	So I just found this sub and think the idea of aquaponics looks amazing!  I'd love to keep some fresh veggies, but I move about once every year or two and my outdoor gardens never end well (I take care of them, but I don't get outside as much as I'd like when I'm home...indoor might cure that as I could monitor as a hobby much easier).  I'm wondering if there are any recommendations of where to begin.  I'd love to find out how to make a nice indoor setup, vertical or otherwise.  I am going to start doing some research, but thought a post might help out quite a bit.  Thanks all!	t5_2rioe	True

1356525055.0	15grx4	Regarding Temperature.	Spaghe-t	9	1	10	"My small scale system is outside on my veranda, and it's beginning to get a bit colder in the northern hemisphere. Is there a water temperature where I need to be alarmed and invest in a water heater? I'd like to refrain from using a heater as ""this kills the wallet"" and my wallet does not enjoy dying. 

the temperatures I'm most concerned about are

* The temps my bacteria stop working
* The temps that are dangerous for fish (I have goldfish that are probably fine unless the water freezes, but other people might have some more sensitive fish)
* The temps that plants are going to die. air/water

Any tips are welcomed and appreciated.
