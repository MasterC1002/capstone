She tells him; ""Tell them you know the truth and they'll give right in!""

So Shinji goes to Ritsuko and says; ""I know the truth!""

""Please don't tell the Commander.""
""Then cancel today's Synch Test.""
""OK.""

Then Shinji goes to Gendo and says the same thing.

""I know the truth!""
""How much will it cost to keep you quiet?""
""100,000 dollars.""
""Here.""

Just to see what happens, Shinji goes to Fuyutski and says ""I know the truth!""

Fuyutski smiles, opens his arms and says;

1372693495.0	1hfj5n	[RANT] Why do people hate Shinji so damn much?	BlackMKIII	141	25	94	"**EDIT PREFACE**: *Yes, I'm well aware I'm posting this on the NGE subreddit where most people will agree ""I don't hate Shinji, I just think X,"" and that's fine. My problem is that there are people out there who say things like ""Oh, I love Eva but I hate Shinji."" ""Shinji is the worst main character in anime history, but the rest of the series is awesome."" ""I like Eva, but it would be so much better if Shinji wasn't a bitch."" That is who I direct this towards. Those are the people I want to see this. They're the people that need to see things from his point of view. They're the ones who fail to truly grasp how great of a character Shinji is and that his arc through the series is what makes NGE what it is.*

This is something that has always bothered me from the very beginning. We all like to laugh and make cracks about how Shinji whines so much. We joke ""Shut up, Shinji"" every time he says ""I mustn't run away."" But here's a thought, let's put you in his shoes:

You're 14. The world is shit. Your mother was ""killed"" in a horrible activation incident when you were a little kid, and since then your father has abandoned you to live with various teachers and other caretakers until one day, at 14 (**FOURTEEN**) he sends you a note with an ID card that more or less says ""get your stupid ass here right now.""

So you show up. The city you're called to is a ghost town, you try and call the person that's supposed to pick you up but there's no answer. You think you see some creepy albino chick in the middle of the road, but you blink and she's just gone.

Then, out of nowhere, a *giant fucking monster* shows up and starts terrorizing the city. There's air support laying into the thing. It keeps marching. They fire rockets at it, it blows them to smithereens. **HOLY FUCKING HELL WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE.** Oh, *now* your ride shows up, all smug and shit about being ""real late."" Fuck it, get in the car, let's GTFO.

Phew, cool, we're at a safe distance now. Might as well see how this plays out with this monster atta- **HOLY BALLS THEY DROPPED A NUKE ON IT.** On the plus side, boobs on your head. That's kinda awesome, you guess. Sucks you have to help this nice lady fix her car now, though. At least she's hot. Maybe you'll get to stick your face in those boobs again, that was nice.

Oh, we're going down an elevator now and she's explaining to you why your dad was such a callous ass for all these years? Cool. Oh, neat, a Geofront. Damn, this shit is really deep under ground.

Aaaaaaaaaaand now we're lost. She may be pretty, but you don't think this chick has a brain in her head. Finally, someone shows up that knows where they're going. More tunnels, moving walkways, gondolas next to some weird red fluid. Damn, this place *is* a maze. And was that a hand you saw in that tank? The hell is going on here, and why'd it get da- **WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT GIANT FUCKING HEAD THING!?**

Dafuq? That's a giant robot, and they want *you* to get in and pilot it against that giant monster you saw outside? Uh-uh. Noooooo way. Great, *now* your father decides to show up. And all he's doing is yelling at you to get in the fucking robot. Years, *years* of abandonment, and this is all he wanted you for? To pitch you into a giant robot so you could risk your life to save *his* bacon? Asshole. Fuck this, you're out. Apparently they've got someone else to do it anyway.

Wait a second, is that chick on a hospital bed? Holy shit, is she still supposed to be in recovery? And why does she look like the girl on the st- **OH MY GOD WE'VE BEEN HIT.** Is she okay? Did that robot hand just move? Doesn't matter, you check out the girl.

Holy hell, she's bleeding. Like, blood everywhere, and she's in agonizing pain. You can't let her go through this. Now everyone around you is guilt tripping you to get in the fucking robot. Oh god, oh god, *oh god.* You mustn't run away, you mustn't run away, *you mustn't run away.*

So you agree to pilot it. They stick you, clothes and all, into a tube that slots into the robot's neck. They nearly drown your ass *before* explaining that the liquid is there to oxygenate your blood. You nearly choke getting used to it, and it tastes like nasty, stale blood. The world around you transforms so you can see what the robot sees.

And then, you're told to walk. Walk? That's it, just WALK? THAT'S the only instruction you get? Uh, okay. You manage to get this behemoth to take a single step, trip over your own feet, and faceplant into the street. Well, that was embarrassing, and now your face hurts. Why does your face hurt?

**OH SHIT IT'S GOT YOU BY THE HEAD FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK**

**IT'S TEARING YOUR ARM OFF. OH GOD WHY DOES THIS HURT!? WHY DOES IT HUUUUUUUUUUURT!?!?**

Now it's slamming you in the face, repeatedly, with a spike in its forearm. You take hit, after hit, after hit. The cracks are showing in the display. It finally penetrates just in time for them to sever the nerve connections to the body. You black out.

...and that's just the first episode.

TL;DR: Shinji takes a lot of abuse, mentally and physically throughout the series. Why y'all gotta be such a dick about it?

**EPILOGUE EDIT:** After reading all of comments on here, I'm seeing a common thread. It's not just Shinji, it's the cast as a whole. Yes, I have watched the series through more times than any other anime, movie, or TV show. I admit that. I think the main difference between Evangelion and most other shonen material is that these are *human* characters, with *human* flaws. Shinji takes the brunt of the abuse, but he's an emotionally scarred fourteen year old boy who's been abandoned by his father to live with random strangers he's never known until he meets them. He's just gotten used to doing what he's told, whether he likes it or not. So when, after a decade of this, he's more or less guilt-tripped into piloting the Evangelion, of course he's going to be a brat about it.

Same goes for Asuka. Her mother went insane after an activation incident that ripped her soul from her. She starts playing with a doll, referring to it by her child's name. The real Asuka, lacking validation from her mother after being replaced by a doll, seeks it by becoming the best Evangelion pilot the world has ever seen. She's amazing, defeating Angels completely by herself through sheer power and force of will. Then along comes Shinji, who without training beats her performance numbers in a matter of weeks. She has spent her *entire life* becoming the best, and he manages it in a few months. Her entire sense of self comes crashing down around her, and then she is **mentally invaded by an angel and mindfucked beyond repair.** No wonder she's a fucking basket case.

And finally, there's Rei. Oh, Rei. Let's take the genetic material of the organization's leaders wife, cram the soul of an angel into a clone of her, and let her live life as a human so she can experience what's it's like to live among us. Uh, excuse me? Who the fuck thought this was a good idea? Oh, she's dead? Well fuck it, we have backups. Of the backups. Of the backed up backups. Her first go-round she's strangled to death for repeating something her ""father"" said about his lover, who was mentally unstable to begin with, and stuffed into Unit-00. The second time around she actually makes it to the teenage years, and dies while sacrificing herself to save Shinji. At this point we figure out she barely remembers anything between incarnations, but just enough to retain her feelings for Shinji instead of Gendo, thus rejecting Gendo and encouraging Shinji to restart the world rather than end it. Which breaks Shinji's fragile little mind anyway.

I could go on, and on, *and on* about how every single character in Evangelion is more realistic than any other anime/television show, giant robots and alien invasions aside. And I really do think that's why so many people hate it, because they see way too much of themselves in every character and it scares them."	t5_2r6ex	True

1367145107.0	1d9llq	[Spoilers] Eva3.33 - This is going to sound ridiculous but I think we (the viewers) are missing an impact.	NexusT	104	15	80	"Rebuild of Evangelion - now with extra impacts.

In all seriousness I've watched Eva3.33 since the camrip a fair number of times and the only way I can link 2.22 and 3.33 together without alternative timelines etc is that the Near Third Impact and Third Impact are separate events.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Missing Impact"" Evidence in 3.33

Unit6 which Kaworu was piloting (and was the 12th Angel) at the end of 2.22 is now partially merged with the headless Lilith in central dogma. This can't have happened until after the Doors of Guff were closed and Near Third Impact was stopped.  
Unit6/12th Angel has been speared (essentially freezing it in that state). This also can't have happened until after the Doors of Guff were closed and Near Third Impact was stopped.  
Kaworu indicates that Unit6 was remodeled by Lilim (SEELE?) to be autonomous before being ""brought to ruin"".  This event was also not shown in 2.22 and must have occured between 2.22 and 3.33.  
Kaworu also mentions that Central Dogma was the epicentre of the third impact which doesn't gel with the events of 2.22 where all the impacty action was occuring way above Central dogma.  
Citizens of Tokyo3 seem to have been partially transformed into Red Eva's.  
The moon has another blood mark, has a red grid, an atmosphere, and is rotating, its also much closer to the earth than it was in 2.22.  
The Earth has an eye and some teeth...  

So was there another impact sometime after 2.22 that Shinji is completely unaware of?

Kaworu only states that the 3rd impact occurred whilst Shinji was merged with unit 01, buts thats a period  of 14 years, he does say that Shinji was the trigger for it, but he describes the events at the end of 2.22 as near third impact.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Its probably easier to explain in a timeline so here goes:

Ending of 2.22  

Shinji saves ReiII in an awakened Unit 01, Rei2's soul is absorbed into Unit 01's Core. Awakening Unit 01 causes the Door of Guff to open and an impact to begin, this is the near 3rd impact.  

Kaworu halts near third impact with Cassius spear.  Door of Guff closes. End of 2.22  

Unknown amount of time passes seconds/minutes/hours/days/weeks/months/up to 14 years.  

Kaworu exits unit6. - 3.0 Preview  
Unit 01 remains speared by Cassius Lance - 3.0 Preview    
Unit6 decends into dogma without a pilot (Autonomously) - 3.0 Preview  
Spear of Cassius removed from unit 01.  
Unit6 becomes 12th angel, tries to merge with Lilith. Something that has always been told will cause an impact (""The 12th Angel is still alive?"" - 3.33)
All hell breaks loose, people are turned into red eva's, the world gets an eye and some teeth, the moon gets a red grid, inverted pyramid appears.  
Lilith is decapitated and 12th angel is speared by unknown party with another longinus spear, 3rd impact is stopped.  
Eva01 sent into space, Wille formed etc ----&gt; remainder of 14 years pass.  
Eva3.33 start  

Maybe I am overthinking this, the alternative is some incredibly inconsistent writing, that's causing so many people to question how disconnected 2.22 and 3.33 are, what are your thoughts?"	t5_2r6ex	True

I always thought Misato killed him, but I think that's been proven wrong/ I think Anno himself was surprised fans thought that. I noticed something interesting while re-watching, however, that has totally changed my mind. 

Kaji gives Ritsuko cat charms from Kyoto. Ritsuko seems to always be associated with cats as we know. As soon as Ritsuko receives the cats, she warns Kaji of what he's doing, how it's dangerous. He smiles and shrugs it off. 

Then, the scene where Kaji is speaking with the cat lady. Older lady, cats? Sure, that in itself isn't much of a coincidence - most people like cats - but it's already a widely speculated theory that she is Ritsuko's grandmother. (Why would the artists bother with the cats, or an old lady, if it wasn't important? Everything is there for a reason!) What would be the reason why Ritsuko's grandmother would pursue the truth about Marduk, Nerv, Ghern, etc?
Because it killed her daughter, and is killing her granddaughter, of course! 

So after capturing Fuyutsuki, freeing him, Kaji is killed after saying what is translated to ""Yo, you're late."" Who do we know that Kaji groups up with? The cat lady, of course!

(Edit: This occurred to me also - why would she kill Kaji? Suave as he is, he is still an asset to Nerv, delivering the little baby thing and working there.) 

Finally, we inspect a choice scene, very symbolic, of Ritsuko talking on the phone to her grandmother... ""The cat died."" She also says ""Yes, probably, even cats eventually reach the end of their lives.""

So if we're saying Ritsuko's grandmother potentially killed Kaji, and due to the tracked phone calls we've seen (like Shinji's call from Kensuke) perhaps they are referring to Kaji? Due to his line of work, he could be paralleled to a ""cat with 9 lives"", because his work is so dangerous. Also during the phone call, they bring up Ritsuko's mother.. who Ritsuko's grandmother could be working revenge for. Then, Ritsuko says something weird - I'll call you next time? From a secret location, a hidden phone line, perhaps? 

Right after hanging up, Ritsuko looks at a picture of Kaji, Misato and herself. Hmmmmm? 

Anyway, I don't usually post things on reddit and I surely don't usually want to talk about crazy ideas I think of about Evangelion, but I just couldn't help this one. Thanks for reading! :) "	t5_2r6ex	True

1373322266.0	1hw7ip	Theory: Rei represents LCL and Asuka represents AT fields	Skywhaler	80	12	22	"So I've known of Evangelion for the past few years, but I only started trying to watch and understand it like 2 weeks ago (one of the best decisions of my life), at which point a thought hit me. Basically, as you know, the central conflict of the show is the hedgehog dilemma - finding a comfortable balance between individuality and togetherness. Our souls (AT fields) give us individuality, but prevent us from the kind of harmonious existence that instrumentality would supposedly give us. 

Therefore, AT fields represent one end of the spectrum - distance, personal strength, and conflict. When AT fields are brought down, things return to LCL, which thus represents togetherness, uniformity, and harmony.

Rei is often associated with LCL – she smells like it, she’s seen floating/standing/bathing in it a lot, etc. Asuka on the other hand really shines when she’s fighting, which of course means she’s associated with AT fields. Furthermore, Rei’s purpose is to incite instrumentality by emitting a massive anti-AT field. Asuka’s one of the few people to reject instrumentality and maintain her individuality in the EOE. Rei’s whole personality is centered around being submissive and following orders. She basically exists to serve the gemeinschaft, and for the majority of the series exhibits little to no personality. Also, when not in a plugsuit, Rei is almost always seen wearing her school uniform, even when not in school, going along with this idea that she exists to serve society and fit in, as opposed to having an individual identity.

Asuka on the other hand is all about being independent, is fiery and emotional, which causes pain to shinji, but there’s a certain appeal to being with another individual as opposed to a yesman like Rei. Hence why he chooses to reject instrumentality – he thinks it’s better for people to have individuality, even if it causes pain, because it makes the relationships more meaningful.

So do you see where I’m going with this? This is probably something everybody knows, but I’ve been googling symbolism nonstop for the past 2 weeks, and haven’t found anything directly connecting Rei, LCL, Asuka, and the AT fields."	t5_2r6ex	True

ARE YOU NOT EXCITED???? CDJapan have already shipped copies to a lucky few though the official rls date is April 24th. The Japanese rip is **out now**. Expect an English subbed release in a day or two ~~a day or two after that~~. 

**Spoilers**  
Discussion on events / plot / characters / etc in 3.33 **must be marked as spoilers** until AT LEAST seven days after the English subbed rls is out. Mods will make an announcement when it's safe to post 3.0 discussion without spoilers.

**Links**  
Do **not** post direct links to torrents, downloads, rips etc. These will be deleted. Most people know where to find this content and while many of us will be downloading a copy of the film from somewhere, Reddit doesn't need links posted. EDIT: say where you found it if you like (nyaa, tpb, baka-bt, etc), just don't post the actual torrent.  

**Summary**  
1. A Japanese rip is now available. ~~There's no JP rip yet (April 23 22)~~  
2. English subs will likely be added to that JP rip in a day or two by a fansub group and released.  
3. CDJapan (not amazon) have already shipped discs to some. It's in a lovely [cerulean](http://i5.minus.com/iF9k2ZLh3Wuia.jpg).    
4. THERE WILL NOT BE AN ENGLISH DUB FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. You will have to wait until a studio in the US decides to license, dub, and release. There's no information on that as far as I know.  
5. No posting torrent or download links.  
6. Come back and discuss it all with us, just mark any discussion as a spoiler for at least the next week or so.  
7. Enjoy it like you're Kensuke given a guided tour of Nerv by a bikini-clad Misato.

1362337503.0	19l760	My Unified Evangelion Theory: The explanation of Mari, the reset, Adams Vessels, and the Giants of Light. (3.0 Spoilers)	androx87	57	6	30	"I have had a few of these ideas floating around in my head for a while now, but during a shower just now they all seemed to fit together perfectly. 

First of all, the four giants of light seen in Rebuild Second Impact are EoE Rei/Lilith, Kaworu/Adam, Shinji, and Asuka. After EoE, Shinji and Asuka lived for several years in the post-Third Impact world possibly not aging due to the ""Curse of Eva"". Eventually they had a daughter, Mari. At this point, Immortal Time God Rei and Kaworu from Instrumentality appear before the new family and offer them a way to allow Mari to grow up in a world that hasn't been through an apocalypse. The four of them perform an Impact-like ritual that resets humanity, and transform into Eva-like giants of light. This is the Rebuild Second Impact.

Seele discovers young Mari at the epicenter of Second Impact, and collects her along with the giants of light. The giants contain the souls of the original versions of Rei, Kaworu, Shinji, and Asuka. The Kaworu giant is remodeled into the Mark 06, Rei into the Mark 09, Shinji into Eva 13, and Asuka into Eva 08. This explains why Mari is able to pilot Eva 08: it contains the soul of her mother. These units are what everyone refers to as ADAMS or Adams Vessels in 3.0.

This also explains why the Rebuild Impacts are different: Instead of trying to merge all souls into a single being, Seele is trying to replicate Second Impact and transform everyone into Evangelion-like beings. Evidence of this is seen throughout 3.0 as the strange Eva-like figures that seem to have appeared during Third Impact.

TL;DR The four giants of light are Rei, Kaworu, Shinji, and Asuka from EoE and are remodeled into the ""Adams Vessel"" series of Evas, Mari is the daughter of EoE Shinji and Asuka, and rebuild Instrumentality is trying to turn everyone into Evas.

Re-take is a 6-volume manga drawn by Studio Kimigabuchi that follows on  directly after End of Evangelion, where Shinji and Asuka are by the sea of LCL. The quality of writing is absolutely impressive, and only gets better as the series go on as the artist improves on his style.

Without spoiling too much, this manga follows Evangelion's classic example of presenting what you expect to be a normal scenario, and then progressing to a roller coaster ride to somewhere that you really, REALLY did not expect to go to, but am glad to have had the ride. This is very much a character driven story, and i consider it  of good enough quality to have been written by anno himself.

Re-Take, revised edition (full, and i think better than first edition)

On that note, as I'm sure just about everyone and their mother is aware, the 3.33 rips are out and a number of English dubs are up an running. I know some of you have already seen the cams/read plot outlines for the movie, but there are also those (myself included) who have just finished watching for the first time and probably have a lot of questions and theories they would like to discuss. So I figured we could save the mods the hassle of deleting every spoiler post and just localize all discussion about the film to one thread that can be easily avoided by those who wish to retain their Evarginity until some future time.

I figured the best result would come from putting this idea out here and letting someone more qualified take it on.


Since it is looking more and more like we have a long way to go for a full, high quality camrip, the idea came to me that we should take everything we have and Frankenstein it together into a semi-watchable facsimile of 3.0. I'm talking about the first 7 minutes official release, the 13 minute camrip with various scenes from the first half of the film, the final 23 minute camrip, and all of the online summaries and translated script. 


My idea is not only to splice the videos together in the correct order, but to use various first hand accounts, written summaries, and the script to give an on-screen text explanation of what is transpiring in between the partial footage, maybe accompanied by some promotional stills and music from the soundtrack. Hell, if anyone wants to narrate the text, that could work too.

I highly recommend this series if you're an eva fan, it's a mecha anime, which isn't really about the mecha, it's sort of a ""monster of the week"" series which focus's mainly on the characters, it's very much a character-driven story, and the characters are all quite broken. Each episode or 2 mainly focus's on a different child/pilot, and basically gives you their backstory, and reasons for fighting, but it tends to be extremely dark and heavy. If anyone else has seen it and can help me recommending it, would be appreciated, i'm terrible with words. but if you like the character side of Eva, watch it.

1362816811.0	19yoxa	Anyone like Magic the Gathering and Evangelion?	stupidhank7	43	8	24	"So I've spent some time creating cards and a new game type inspired by Evangelion. Ideally, you'd play these cards with a large (4+) group of players. In the game, everyone plays their own deck of cards. All eva creatures start in exile and two stacks of cards (a stack of Angels and misc. cards called Events) belonging to no one await in the center. Also in the center are two cards, [Evangelion Fate](http://i.imgur.com/6L6WFu8.png) and [NERV Geofront](http://i.imgur.com/2yj2bre.png), that are under the control of whoever's turn it currently is. They pretty much explain how the stacks and evas affect the game. Opinions?

1372106207.0	1gzpqb	A question to Mari fans	Lyonface	34	2	53	"When it comes to Evangelion characters, the series has given us a blueprint of what we can expect. Nearly all characters that were given ample time and influence in the series was originally some archetype, but then was revealed to be fundamentally broken in some way that lead them to hurt themselves/other people. It is a great deconstruction, and I hate that I didn't get into it sooner.

However, Mari has been grating on my nerves since the ending of 2.22. She sings, she fights, she used Beast Mode, she's got boobs and glasses, and she seems to like pink. Cool. But what makes her useful in this series? Sure, the movies have strayed from the show in that the focus has shifted from the characters' plights to a more story based narrative, but Mari seems to have no depth to me whatsoever and I can't stand it.

The most revealing thing I remember her saying was something to the extent of, ""I'm hesitant about involving adults in my affairs."" And then, nothing. She seems kind to Shinji and able to take all of this rather well (far too well) and gets along with...most everyone. She's likable, but what is her purpose? Characters serve a purpose in the series and people ricochet off of each other all the time, but she just is kind of...there.

Now, the last third or so did redeem the movie a bit in my eyes, but the whole plot is just so fucking stupid. I want 4.0 to just be a loop of everyone in the 3.0 dying horribly because they are all too stupid to exist.

Apparently the Willies woke up Shinji Redux just so they could tell him how much they hate him. Misato apparently hates his ass so much that she felt the need to bring him back just to fuck with him. Then when Rei Unnumbered comes to pick him up everyone flips a shit because he decides to hang with the person he thinks he saved instead of the group of asshats who answer all his questions with ""Did you know you're terrible? Also that collar makes your head explode."" Really, did no one see that was going to end terribly? I don't even think we get the names of the New Willy Bridge Bunnies, so I will now refer to them as ~~Captain Baldo~~ Lordgenome and Fat-Lips McGee. God, they're even more useless than Mari.

Who the hell decided that the only piece of information Shinji^2 could be trusted with was the fact that he's now 14 years in the future? Seriously, that should have accomplished nothing except to confuse the kid, but Shinji Jr. is so fucking stupid that he just takes it in stride. The only person of any worth in the movie is Kaworu, but even he fails to tell the guy who already blew up Earth once what the hell is going on. Why did no one realize that a little information might help Shinji 2:Electric Boogaloo make good decisions?

The whole movie is just one wave of stupidity after the other. Dammit, Anno! Why do I watch these things!

&lt;/rant&gt;

Glad I got that off my chest, I feel much better now. Hopefully I'll enjoy it more once it comes out on Blueray. Gonna go drink some tang while I wait.

EDIT: On the bright side, I didn't spot any Doritos or NewBalance shoes, so maybe we're done with that stuff?

EDIT2: gwern correctly identified Captain Baldo as Lordgenome, so I fixed his name. "	t5_2r6ex	True

A lot of ppl are calling it an Evangelion rip-off. But in a Q&amp;A with The Guardian, he said that he hasn't yet watched Evangelion but grew up with many mecha anime like Patlabor and Testujin 28. 

&gt; I'll happily admit to any influence - like Patlabor, or Testujin 28 or many other mecha/pilot anime or manga from a long genealogy - I was born in 1964 and thus privy to most of the evolution of the mecha and Kaiju genres. However, Evangelion remains something I am yet to watch. I enthusiastically bought some of the figures based on the design, and hope to see the anime soon, but the answer remains, so far ""no"".

1366337888.0	1cnhp0	Religion in Evangelion: An Alternate Opinion	orangechicken29	39	10	21	"It is generally agreed upon here in r/evangelion that the religious themes found in Evangelion are meaningless, as Anno placed them only for the novelty of the idea. Therefore, when watching the series we should not pay any special opinion to the religious symbolism. I disagree with this.

Yes, Gainax came out to admit that the choice to include Christian and Judaic symbolism was inspired by Japan's general ignorance of these two religions. Thus, many have drawn the conclusion that the symbolism should be disregarded, and not considered in seriousness while analyzing the series. This view is wrong, and here is my argument:

Though the choice to choose Christian and Judaic symbolism was not significant, what is significant is the specific symbols Anno decided to place throughout the series. In other words, we should not analyze the overall placement of Christian-Judaic imagery, but it is perfectly acceptable to consider and analyze specific instances of the symbolism. Anno did not randomly choose symbolism to include. It is not a coincidence that Lillith is crucified, or that the beings bringing about our destruction are called angels, or that the hole in the rei/lillith's hands are called The Sea of Guf and that they interact with the unleashed souls in EOE, or that Tabris (or Kaworu's angel name) is also the angel of free will and self-determination in biblical studies. Anno didn't randomly assemble a conglomeration of arbitrary biblical references just because Japanese people wouldn't understand it. If he had, then the references wouldn't line up. The holes in Rei's hands would be called 'Bethlehem' and Kaworu 'Tabris' would be called instead Kaworu 'gabriel', or something along those lines. His placement of symbolism was not random, but intentional and significant

AGAIN, though the decision to include an overall theme of christian and judaic symbolism IS NOT significant, the individual instances of this symbolism ARE significant, and demands the consideration it hasn't received.

End note: Just in case, this obviously isn't Anno shoving religion in your face. It also isn't me shoving religion in your face. If we are to look at the Christian imagery and symbolism in Evangelion, we are to look at it in a purely textual sense, like we might examine greek mythology today."	t5_2r6ex	True

1367897753.0	1dua8g	I just rewatched the original series after 9 years, it held up!	Seekr12	32	3	21	"WOW. Just wow. Eva became my favorite series after I watched it 9 years ago, and it still holds that spot after 9 years. I figured I would give the original show a re-watch after watching 3.0. In watching it as a 25 year old as compared to a 16 year old, I identified with different characters. I see a lot of the struggles that Misato goes through in myself and friends I've had (finding meaning in your job, the difficulty of adult relationships, insecurity of female friends of mine). Shinji, I think, is universally relatable for anyone who has ever suffered from mental health issues or has known someone who has. After all these years, as a 25 year old, I still don't find him annoying, and find the way he reacts to situations completely realistic.

During the first couple episodes, the show felt very ""monster of the week-ish"", which scared me, as I was afraid my favorite anime of all time would be ruined by watching it objectively rather than through nostalgia goggles, but I began to realize that each episode is packed with so much subtle characterization, so many tiny details of character development-and it all just comes together.

Another thing I appreciated more were the psychological elements. I graduated with a degree in Social Work and was a Psych major for 2 years, so I have a decent understanding of psychological/developmental concepts. One thing I didn't quite grasp as a 16 year old is the big pile of Oedipal/Electra complexes everyone has, attachment problems, characters being incredibly insecure- there's so much to unpack from a psychological perspective.

The battles held up, particularly when 1.0 goes berserk in episode 20-holy crap- i'd forgotten how brutal that was. Other things I'd completely forgotten was the battle vs. the Fourth Child (I'd forgotten about the Fourth Child in general), Gendo rebelling against SEELE throughout the entire series, (I don't even remember realizing this as a 16 year old), and the intricacies of Kaworu in episode 24. Another thing I completely MISSED as a teen is that there are 3 Reis throughout the show. I don't know how I enjoyed the damn show so much as a kid if I didn't pick up on some of it's biggest concepts!

And the controversial episode 25/26- I thought I would find them annoying, especially after knowing that Gainax was broke and tried to cut corners, but IMO they pulled limited resources and created some truly unique art in 25/26. Misato's ""case"" was very disturbing to me this time around. Misato again- I just really found ways to relate to her, and also to Kaji, throughout the series. Perhaps it's because I'm around the same age group as them and have dealt with similar questions.

And now, on to End of Eva! I think I may wait till tomorrow to watch it, I want to savor it and think about a lot of what I've just watched. Also, I don't think my brain can handle that many mind-screws in a night.

How have subsequent rewatches changed the perception of the show for you guys? I honestly didn't think I'd enjoy the re-watch as much as I did, and I'm glad everything felt fresh. Eva seems to be a show where one can discover something new every time one revisits it."	t5_2r6ex	True

1353882517.0	13s28u	[SPOILERS] I've seen Evangelion 3.0 twice now, in Japanese theatres. AMA about it. Spoilers abound!	Kilbourne	31	2	166	"I live in Japan, and have seen Eva3 twice now. It is certainly incredible. Ask me any questions you want about it! My Japanese is middling, so I won't be able to tell you the subtle things that everyone spoke about, or hinted at, etc., but I will be able to speak about the basic plot outline, and answer technical questions about the Eva units, weapons and settings, etc.

For example: [I can tell you about the implied events that occurred after the end of 2.0, and the beginning of this film](/spoiler)

edit: clarity.

EDIT 2: I'm still answering and updating.


EDIT 3: Concerning Terminal Dogma: [I've mentioned below that there is a Giant White headless body (in the same vein as Giant Evil Rei from EoE) down there, on a field of 01 skulls, speared through by a Lance held by a white fossilized 06. Now, the translation says 'that is Lillith', however the shape of the body, and its position, resemble Shinji and his body language in both 2.0 and EoE to such an extent that I cannot help but assume that he became a Lillith-being during 3rd Impact. The white body is Shinji, reaching from Terminal Dogma towards the Giant Evil Rei far above (because there's one of those as well). I may be wrong, but that is what I saw.](/spoiler)



Speculation on the nature of Rebuild:

**Not going to bother spoilering 2.0 stuff.**

Right, so Shinji is in God-mode. He's making Third Impact happen. He's got Giant Red Rei in his arms and he's core-diving from 01 to Zeruel to get her out. Everything is peachy.

* Akagi says, ""This is Third Imact.""
* CREDITS
* Deity-01 gets a spear through the chest. An *un-named* spear.
* Kaworu descends from on-high and says ""This time I will save you, Shinji-kun.""

Now, ignoring all of the implications of time-loops and timeslips and who knows what, etc., we'll move on; [Third Impact happened. Kaworu eventually stopped Shinji before the end(?) but it happened, but was not complete. Or perhaps it was a full Impact, but not Instrumentality. Whatever. Point is, in 3.0, third impact occurred. In Q, K talks about two spears; Cassius and Longinus. However, upon seeing those spears, he remarks, ""they're the same / have the same shape,"" in ever-ambiguous Japanese. That only leaves questions about the nature of Lances/spears.](/spoiler)


&gt;Your second spoiler'd comment

^ Now this is where things get weird.

[Let's assume for a moment that Kaworu knows that at one time, he and Shinji already knew one another. The only time this could have occurred, in established continuity, was in the original series. So now we have evidence that either Kaworu is conscious of another piece of media (breaking the fourth wall) or he is conscious of some sort of 'time loop' or repeat of actions. So, Premise 1: Kaworu is conscious of previously meeting Shinji in the Series.](/spoiler)

[Following that, we have the 3.0, or 'Q'. Q shows unequivocally that something called 3rd Impact happened before the beginning of the film. It shows parallels with EoE, including Giant Evil Rei, the blood-grid-moon, Asuka having the same injuries as she held after the harpies, etc. 1.0 also had holdover from EoE, such as the red seas and harpy-shaped-chalk outlines on the shores. However, Q also has a character from 2.0 (Mari). What does this mean? 1.0, 2.0, and Q all refer to events within EoE. 2.0 follows 1.0 in a neat, clean manner. All continuity of 1.0 goes to 2.0. Q is where things go wonky. Premise 2: EoE happened before these films. Premise 3: 1.0 and 2.0 are linked, one after the other. Or, Premise 2/3: Canon is now Series -&gt; EoE -&gt; 1.0 -&gt; 2.0](/spoiler)

[At the end of 2.0, we see K spear god01. It stops glowing and things are okay. In Q, we see that K failed to stop Impact. god01 is not speared. Third impact occurred. In Q we see evidence from EoE; Giant Evil Rei, blood-grid black moon. There is no evidence from Q that is unique to 2.0. Premise 4: Q is not necessarily linked to anything but EoE](/spoiler)

What does this mean? Let's review the premises:
1. [Kaworu is conscious of previously meeting Shinji, in the Series.](/spoiler)
2. [Canon events are Series -&gt; EoE -&gt; 1.0 -&gt; 2.0](/spoiler)
3. [3.0/Q is only linked to EoE](/spoiler)

Following those premises, [there is more than one timeline, likely two. One of them is EoE -&gt; 1.0 -&gt; 2.0. The other is EoE -&gt; Q.](/spoiler)

Now, you're thinking, hey, what about the SDAT? [Well, sure, Rei had it with her in 2.0, at the end. Shinji wakes up in Q and is it is returned to him by Misato. He asks where Rei is, and she doesn't know. However, the SDAT player was also in *Shinji's* plug at the end of EoE. Weirdly enough, there is nothing specific that I can recall, said or seen in Q, that would indicate that Q explicitly follows 2.0.](/spoiler)

[However, there is also no explicit evidence that it does not. So here we are. Q could be a sequel to EoE, to 2.0, or even it's own continuity!](/spoiler)

What does this mean for 2.0? [Well, it means that Kaworu saved Shinji, in his post-credit spearchuck. He did it. That was the Good End.](/spoiler)

What does it mean for Q? [This follows EoE, and *not* 2.0. I mean, it's even called ""You can (not) advance""](/spoiler)

What does this mean for 4.0 a.k.a. ||? [The preview at the end of Q shows Unit 2-8 fighting a horde of military-paint Evas outside of the weird Geofront thing from Q. So, at this point, we can assume that || will continue from Q. However, the preview form post-credit 2.0 showed stuff that *did not happen in Q*, stuff that there was even no indication of having happened, even between the two films. Impossible things! For that reason alone, I don't think that the post-credit previews can be counted for canon-evidence. 4.0/|| is still a mystery.](/spoiler)


Points against this?
* [Um, who put 01 in space for the beginning of Q, then?](/spoiler)
* [Dude. Mari. Come on. How can Q not be linked to 2.0?!](/spoiler)
* [Wouldn't people remember Instrumentality?](/spoiler)
* [What about waking up on the beach?](/spoiler)
* [And a whole lot more!](/spoiler)

I thought for myself: ""Hmm okay, this must be some kind of Victorian styled mecha anime with heavy emphasis on religion"" 

I actually imagined the mechas to look somewhat like [this](http://konachan.com/image/af69191393056d2519b742c19fadd62f/Konachan.com%20-%2060985%20mecha%20neon_genesis_evangelion%20sword%20weapon.jpg), and they were mechanical! I imagined the angels to be some glorified and beautiful creatures that would invade the minds of people, and their goal was to salvage the humanity.

In other words I expected something beautiful.

**This is what I got:**

**-HOLY FUCKING SHIT, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT UGLY MONSTER?! D:**

**-The most relatable main character to date.**

**-DID THAT ROBOT JUST BLEED, GO BERSERK, REGENERATE ITS EYE, AND LOOK BACK AT SHINJI?!?! O_o**

**-A very gritty and unexpected story.**

**-One of the most daunting experiences in anime so far.**

**-End of Evangelion.**

1368760010.0	1ehul6	Little Mari theory with big implications	EthanStrong	27	1	29	"**Things to get out of the way first:**

* This theory is totally dependent on the [sequel theory](http://i47.tinypic.com/zj9csg.jpg) and the [Mari clone theory](http://i.imgur.com/M8RtY6M.jpg) being true
* This theory is pretty complex

* This theory is only half baked

With that said let's get started

**I believe that Mari may be the soul of Rebuild Adam inside a clone of Asuka's mother.**

Now I know what you're thinking, ""Isn't Adam's soul inside of Kaworu?"".
As of right now we pretty much know that Kaworu is Adam inside of a human vessel, but let's examine a line from 3.33 really quick. 

""I never imagined that I, the First Angel, would be cast down to the Thirteenth.""

While this is a pretty rough translation it gets the point across. Kaworu is the vessel of the first angel, Adam. I am proposing that there are two souls of Adam, NGE Adam and Rebuild Adam. I think that NGE Adam may be inside of Kaworu and Rebuild Adam may is inside of Mari.

**Evidence:**

* Kaworu seems to remember the events of NGE, which wouldn't make sense if he wasn't the same character (NGE Adam)

* Mari seems to know what's going on at all times and doesn't get shocked

* Mari refers to Gendo with the honorific of ""kun"" which is usually used when speaking to a male who is younger than you. Adam is probably the oldest being on the (Rebuild) planet, so that would make sense.

* Mari looks strikingly similar to a character we believe to be Asuka's mom and is potentially a clone of her

* Mari can interface with Unit 2, which contains the soul of Asuka's mother

* The only other clone we know about, Rei, has the soul of Lilith inside of her, which leads me to believe that clones need a soul to function

* Kaworu has is own motive, making Shinji happy, and Mari seems to have her own motive as well but that hasn't been revealed yet. Personal motivations could be a trait of Adam's soul, similar to Rei's anti-social traits.

**Things we don't know:**

* How did Kaworu get to the Rebuild world?

* What does Mari want exactly?

* Why would someone want to clone Asuka's mother?

* Is Eva finally making me insane?

**What do you guys think?**

Am I crazy? Is all of this crackpot nonsense? Is Mari really just some girl? Tell me what you think in the comments and let me know if there's anything that could be added.

1367673238.0	1dod14	Shinji and the 14 year gap... [baseless, mad theory I've had recently]	Mr_Butler	34	8	19	"So its assumed Shinji became a part of Unit 01 and was sleeping for the past 14 years. He comes back when WILLE is recovering him to save Asuka from an Angel and then they find his comatose body in the plug.

What if he chose not to come back, not because he had no choice, but because he was trying to save the world from himself?

at the end of 2.22, N3I happens because of Unit 01. It stops when Unit 01 is speared. (this can be seen as a slap round the face situation) Shinji realises what he's doing and stops, killing Rei in the process (he may have destroyed Yui's soul in the process). At this point he is a part of Unit 01 and no longer has his own body. He decides the only way to stop an impact from happening is to stop Unit 01 from activating ever again. When they try to pilot Unit 01, Shinji doesn't let them, or kills the pilot (quite possibly killed Toji this way).

A little later, Unit 01 is launched into space for some reason inside a box. If Shinji can sense everything going on around him, he would be experiencing a dark, claustrophobic, box in complete silence and loneliness. He knows he can break out of this prison in the blink of an eye, but he knows if he does that he might cause an impact and kill everyone. So he spends fourteen years in orbit, mostly likely he's broken down several times. Then WILLE comes along to recover him.

The angel may have been there to keep him inside the box, or it has just shown up and is trying to get to Unit 01. We don't know. We do know WILLE wants to recover Unit 01, they don't care about Shinji. Unit 01 has never needed power to activate, on several occasions its activated without power before it absorbed the Angels core. So we can assume Unit 01 is still receiving radio transmissions from the other Evas. Asuka calls out for Shinji's help, the girl who he thought he felt kill years earlier. He owed it to her to save her life.

Shinji kills the angel with an eye beam, that couldn't cause an impact, its just an eye beam. There's a hole in his prison. He can see through it. He see's the Earth, and the moon... in ruins. He'd sacrificed 14 years of his life to banishment, and the 3rd Impact had still happened. He looses it. His mind breaks. What good did keeping Unit 01 away from them do, he may as well just let them do what ever they want with it. He doesn't want to be in that thing again, not after the hell he's just experienced, so he makes it appear he has no synch with Unit 01 any more. He suppresses the past 14 years of his life and takes back his original human form.

WILLE pulls open Shinji's plug and find him there in a comatose state. It brings back a lot of bad memories. Where was Shinji when this happened, they needed him and he chose to hide away in his Eva for 14 years. He has no memory of what's happened over the past 14 years, and no one tells him what's happened.

Zoom to the end of 3.33 and Shinji is catatonic inside his plug. He's been in denial of the fact 14 years have really passed and everything that's happened is his fault for not being there to stop it. He remembers the 14 years he spent inside Unit 01.

[This Scene](http://animekritik.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/vlcsnap-2011-05-08-12h39m57s69.png) from the Evangelion 2.22, where Shinji is ""trowing a temper tantrum"" after being forced to nearly kill Asuka, he stomps on the pyramid. 

And [This Scene](http://wiki.evageeks.org/images/1/14/EoE_Sandbox_finished_pyramid2.jpg) from the End Of Evangelion where he sees himself as a child, playing in the sand, he makes a pyramid, and then proceeds to kick it down.

1359275959.0	17d1u1	Just a thought on a minor difference between Rebuild and the Original	elmergantry1960	28	4	13	"When it comes to piloting the Evangelions, Rebuild and NGE have an incredibly different feel to them. 

In the original they seemed like dystopian robotics, or someone worn down by metal plates. They felt heavy and hard to move. I think the best example of this is when Shinji first pilots the EVA and a single shot when Asuka fight the EVA series in EoE. When Shinji first tries to move, he can hardly step forwards (and falls on his face). And when Asuka picks up one of the bladed weapons off the ground to clash with another EVA, she has to strain herself to lift it. The EVAs of the original series are very clunky and difficult to pilot. 

On the other hand, in Rebuild, the EVAs have an extreme biological feeling to them. There are fewer shots of the characters in the EVAs and much more outside. This makes it seem like the characters have synched much better with the EVAs. It makes it seem effortless, especially in Asuka's first angel fight and when Shinji runs across Tokyo-3 to catch Sahaquiel. The EVAs move with equal flexibility as a human, which was never expressed in the Original Series. 

Strangely, the largest exception I can think of to this is in Asuka's final fight in EoE, she uses the Unit-2 like it was in Rebuild. But, she still is straining herself to move in many cases, and you could argue that her realization of the power of her AT Field allowed her to move so freely. 

I'm not going to state an opinion on whether which type of animation for EVA piloting is better, but I find it really interesting. Is it just a difference in budget? Or is there a total stylistic change?

**[Eva Store](http://www.evastore.jp/pc/)**

* The main store. You can get almost any Evangelion merchandise here. Almost.

* What you can get here: Almost all kinds of general Evangelion merchandise

* Domestic Shipping: 472 yen

**[Eva T Store](http://www.eva-t.jp/)**

* As the name suggests, you can get T-shirts from here, ranging from the normal Cospa ones to the fully colour printed expensive ones.

* What you can get here: T-shirts 

* Domestic Shipping: 420 yen


**[Eva Custom](http://evacustom.jp/)** 

* As the name implies, you can customise designs that they have, choosing it to be on iphone covers, tote bags, or t-shirts. You can choose the color too.

* What you can get here: Customized bags, PSP covers, iPhone cover, t-shirts

* Domestic Shipping: 600 yen


**[Radio Eva](http://radio-eva.jp/)**

* This is where you can get all the branded Eva collaboration goods. Out of all the stores, I would say that this has the most expensive stuff. 

* What you can get here: Bags, shoes, clothes, jewellery

* Domestic Shipping: 500yen

**[Eva Movie](http://www.eva-movie.com/)**

All of these shops only ship within Japan, with a flat shipping rate per order.

The keyword to look out for when you're looking around for stuff is 売り切れ, which means that the item is sold out. Most of the time, items that are sold out will not be restocked.

For the past few months, I have been helping people to buy and ship goods from the various stores for a small fee. I take payment in Singapore Dollars via Paypal personal payments (+5% more if you pay via normal payment), as I pay for these orders using my overseas credit card(It's a pain in the ass trying to get a Japanese one). I ship via EMS, which takes about 2-3 days within Asia, and 3-5 days to the US/Canada.

I'll be in Tokyo for at least the next 3 years, so feel free to message me if you would like to get something."	t5_2r6ex	True

Seekr12	28	5	20	"I see a lot of ""I just watched Eva, what should I watch next that's similar?"" asked on here, and my advice to all of you that ask that is to watch Serial Experiments Lain. I believe this so strongly that I decided it needed it's own post.

I re-watched the original series about a month ago and wrote a glowing [write up](http://www.reddit.com/r/evangelion/comments/1dua8g/i_just_rewatched_the_original_series_after_9/) of it here on r/evangelion. After it was over though, I just wasn't quite ready to give up on all the crazy analysis, speculation, theory and walking around in confusion for weeks that an Eva fan is used to. I had read online before that a good show to watch if you like Eva is Serial Experiments Lain.

What is Lain about? Well, in it's simplest form, it's about a girl named Lain that discovers the internet (called ""The Wired"" in the show) and gets caught up in it, blurring the line between real life and the internet.

Now, my criticism since Eva came out is that there are many shows, that while great, are derivative of Eva but just don't deliver that original sense of crazy that Eva gives you (see Madoka, Rahxephon, etc.). These shows are children of Evangelion, and seem at times that they are just trying to emulate Evangelion's themes. I went into Lain thinking that I would enjoy it, but that it would again feel derivative. Booooy oh boy was I wrong.

The show is probably just as insane, if not even crazier, than Eva. There is so much symbolism, speculation, and theory in that show that it will make your head spin. It manages to feel completely independent of Eva, and like Eva, will make you question life, technology, religion, and what it means to be human.

Eva still remains my favorite show- Lain is excellent, but doesn't come close to the character studies that Eva gives us. Lain, live Eva, is worth re-watching many times, as you will pick up something new each time. It's a little bit slow paced, but it's worth it."	t5_2r6ex	True

1369134837.0	1eraay	I just finished the series and watched EoE, and I don't even know where to begin. Nobody I know has seen it, so I'm kinda going crazy with the amount of shit I need to communicate here.	binauralshitsound	28	5	32	"Okay, let me start by saying that this is one of the absolute best pieces of media that I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. The entire series up until the final two episodes completely surpassed all expectations I might have harbored, and now it's sitting right next to Ghost in The Shell: Stand Alone Complex on my brain scale. 

I mean, goddamn. At first I didn't think I'd like it. I thought Shinji was a complete fucktard and a pussy. But then I realized that people are fucktards and pussies in real life, and that he was actually acting pretty realistically given his relationship with his father. My initial dislike for him peaked when I saw that he was willing to allow a thin, badly injured, clearly traumatized girl climb into that cockpit in his stead. I've always been a Gundam fan, so I was thinking things like ""Wow, Amuro would probably have climbed into the EVA without anyone telling him to, get over yourself"", but I grew to like him more and more over the initial episodes. He's socially awkward, so am I. He has trouble with expressing his thoughts and feelings, so do I. He lost his mother at a young age, so did I. I grew to know him, and the rest of the cast, and eventually love them for different reasons. 

The characters. Oh man, these are some serious fucking characters. Everybody on this show, just like everyone IRL, is totally fucked in the head. Shinji's childhood has left him unable to socially function, self-hating, and terrified of affection. Misato is a revenge-bent drunken slob who lives to fuck up Angels. Rei, I don't even know where to start, that's just a bottomless pit of WTF. At first I thought she was just awesome, from seeing her unquestioningly agree to pilot the Eva when Shinji was having a douche-attack, hearing her Spock responses, not giving a shit when Shinji was in her house being a tard, and slapping him on the escalator. I just thought, ""Wow, this girl gives no fucks"", but after the whole clone tank thing, I don't know how to feel about her, which is good. She's a complex character. Asuka is a cunt. That is all. 

Mind you, this isn't a review, and I'm hamfistedly going over everything here, so don't take much of it seriously. I'm dumbfounded, I'm not even sure what I think after seeing EoE, and I've watched the series over two days, so I'm digesting still, and will be for a long time, over more viewings. 

The Eva's themselves are badass as all fuck. Once again, being a Gundam dude since mid childhood, I approached the series with a biased eye. I had seen Eva models in figures in stores, and never really liked the designs. Upon seeing them battle Angels, I loved them. I ""understood"" them once they were in motion, on screen, if you will. Especially since their true natures unravel over the course of the series, I have to say Gundam doesn't come close to the level of awesome here. Eva's aren't giant weapons of war, there aren't any Eva duels or legendary Ace pilots here, it's something entirely different, something more. The enemy isn't another faction with Eva's of their own, it's something...horrible. The Angels are terrifying enemies, the only word I can describe them with properly, and fittingly, is biblical. Eva's vs angels is just as iconic to me now as Gundam vs Zaku. 

There's just, there's just too much for me to talk about. I could go over every little thing, but there's not enough room. I guess I just wanted to vent to the appropriate outlet. 

Now, the ending. I know that there's an endless amount of discussion about this predating my even being aware of the series by years, but this is what I really want to talk about. I feel...betrayed. Believe me, I didn't want or expect a happy ending. I didn't think Shinji would get with one of his fellow pilots and live happily ever after, but I wanted the story to end. I wanted resolution, at least in part, for the characters I'd come to care about. Neon crucifixes covering the Earth and giant naked space Rei didn't really accomplish this for me. At all. I wanted Rei especially to find some kind of meaning in life, apparently being a clone. In the movie, I was hoping that shit would go down on a more...personal level. When Asuka, the bitch that she is, took the field, I wanted Shinji to get over himself and go help her. I wanted Rei to tell Gendo to go fuck himself, jump in 00, and join her other two pilots. I wanted them to fight together, temporarily putting aside their massive, personality-flaw driven differences, and just be Eva pilots, the thing that threads their lives together. For all their shit, they've been through hell together, and I really, really wanted them to suit up and kick some SEELE ass, leaving a field of those shitty white Eva's destroyed. To be honest, I don't even know how I'd really know want it all to pan out, that movie was just too much disappointment for me. 

After the episode where they work together to kill that spider fucker who was oozing the HQ, and again when all three of them work to take out the giant, three eyeballed orbital bastard, I really expected to start seeing them grow together more as pilots. People don't do that kind of thing together without being brought closer, like war buddies. I guess I just wanted some of that mechanic to emerge when SEELE was attacking, but it never did. 

I don't claim to understand fully what went on in EoE, but I just feel like we, the audience, were denied a real ending. I just want resolution for the characters, let NERVE be disbanded, let the Eva's be launched into the sun if that's what's best, just let me see the characters...live. 

I apologize for submitting this massive rant as a post, it's not really relevant, but shit, after all that, it has to go somewhere. I feel like I'll go nuts if I don't talk about it, and I don't have time to get anyone to watch the whole thing right now...just...just...Holy shit, what a series, and I feel that there's a massive void in my emotions where the real ending should be.

ALCxKensei	23	1	16	"So I vaguely remembered once downloading a fan subbed version of Evangelion: Girlfriend of Steel, but never played through it. Last week I tried to redownload the game, but all the links were hosted on megaupload so they were dead. Today I found the CD-R from 2006 that I burned the game onto.  Installed it and it seems to works. (When I first installed it years ago I remember having to create a virtual optical drive or some shit to play the game without a disc. This time, if disc is not in and I click the game's icon, an error message appears that can be ignored by pressing continue, and then the game starts working. So that makes things much easier.)

I remember some people on r/evangelion wanted to play the game. How do I share the game with people? Perhaps someone who knows what they're doing can tell me how to send the files to them and they can post the game for download.

1352513461.0	12y1vy	Looking to buy stuff from the official Eva Store?	notokcomputer	25	2	30	"I came to Japan 2 months ago, and will be studying here for 4 years. Before I came to Japan, I faced the problem of getting stuff I wanted from the Eva store(http://www.evastore.jp), simply because they only ship within Japan. Now that I am here, I no longer face the problem.

Living in Tokyo is expensive, so I would like to earn some side income, and at the same time, help fans of Evangelion who are outside of Japan to get the Eva store goods they desire.

Ordering from the store, there is a fixed fee of  about 500 yen for the payment fee, and 500 yen for shipping to me. EMS to the US for 500g starts at 1500 yen. It is pretty expensive to just get one item, so you might want to get more, or consolidate orders to make it with your while. In my opinion, it will be more worth it to get the slightly pricer stuff that is only sold on the Eva store.

I will be taking a 10% comission off the item price (shipping and payment fee not included), and will accept payment via Paypal, with the buyer covering the transfer fees.

If you are interested please drop me a PM. Also, if you are looking to buy stuff from other online shops in Japan, feel free to PM me too."	t5_2r6ex	True

1374386582.0	1iqlmf	I have a theory about Evangelion 3.0's plot and why everything seems... off.	GoldenJoel	43	20	33	"I think Shinji might have been a clone in the new movie.  Here are a few details I noticed while watching:

-Never shown to be taken out of Unit 1.  For all we know, he may not have been in there.

-Being held inside the same containment unit that Asuka was held in after her body was presumably destroyed in 2.0.

-Asked a series of questions about facial recognition, what he last remembers, etc.

-Conveniently reawakened 14 years after 2.0, the age of Shinji at that time.

-Everyone is cold towards this Shinji, including Misato, who encouraged him to act against what was expected of him in 2.0.

-Shinji is told he has a 0% synchronization rate, yet is able to pilot an Eva later in the film. Is possibly being compensated by Kaworu.

-Shinji asks why Asuka is still so young to which she replies, ""Curse of the LCL."" That could mean a number of things. Isn't Rei required to be submerged in LCL to stay alive?

-DDS collar shown to either be ineffective or not even used when Misato has the trigger. If she really hates Shinji for the 3rd Impact, she would have detonated it. Pretty much implied that Misato couldn't have killed this Shinji even if she wanted to.  Plus it seems pretty stupid to hesitate when the world is so close to the brink.  It was set to trigger if the 4th impact happened. 

-Kaworu claims that the DDS collar was meant for him, implying that WILLE stole the collar from NERV.  Could they have stolen Shinji too?

-Shinji can inexplicably play piano with no prior training. Possibly planted inside him so that he would synch well with Kaworu.  You can't explain this by the Synch, because it took Shinji and Asuka a week to match togther PLAYING TWISTER.

-Kaworu seems confused by the 'duplicate' spears, seeing things as 'not right.' Most likely because this Shinji isn't the right Shinji.

1372836350.0	1hjz1a	Congratulations!	LordNephets	29	7	7	"I know this is a topic that is probably beat to death, but I think I can bring something new to the table.

I just finished EVA. I watched the series, skipping the last two episodes, then watched the End of Evangelion, and then went back and watched the final two episodes after I did some research into exactly what was going on.

Unpopular opinion: The last two episodes of the original Eva are my favourite episodes of the entire series, they completely blew me away! 

On one hand, of course there are cons. Obvious budget cuts made some things fall apart, I didn't like that characters mouths never really moved. But aside from that, the flashy scenes, still standing characters, negative space, the words on the screen, I loved all of that. 

I interpreted the last two episodes as what is going on in Shinji's mind during Human Instrumentality (End of Evangelion), and it came across as a very interesting deconstructive/Dadaist form of existentialism. 

I have never seen a show, or even a film that has done such an incredible job of Kierkegaardian Existentialism in only two episodes. Watching Shinji go from a total state of mauvaise foi into the realization of self-creative power was incredible. I haven't been this excited for a character since L'Etranger and Dorian Gray! 

The parallels between Misato, Rei, and Asuka were driving forces between the episodes, the first episode gave some really great lines and answered so many questions I had about each's personality. The moments in which characters would pop in and deliver a single line that almost seemed to break down the other characters was satisfying and ironic, and it all led up to a miraculous finale, where Shinji breaks through the wall and receives a great big Congratulations! And then, as if that wasn't great enough, the animation in the final episode was wonderful. Seeing a reversion to the more high-quality film for a moment in the alternate reality of Shinji in school was really funny and brought back the light-hearted feeling of the first episode, I loved seeing Rei running with toast in her mouth. 

But better yet, was the moment in which Shinji looks up to the sky as everyone claps, and it dawns on you that this is the animation from the opening theme! The entire time the opening theme of the show has given away the entire plot, explained everything, it is a perfect synthesis of the entire concept! The opening theme itself is human instrumentality, these last two episodes took everything about the show, took everything confusing or lost, broke them, melded them into one solid being and gave you understanding! And then in the last moment, Shinji reverses Human Instrumentality and re-creates the world through self-affirmation and creation. 

I just... I don't know what to do. I was not a huge fan of this anime due to some of the ridiculous or inaccurate Christian symbolism, the sometimes blatant fanservice, and the remake series in general, which seems to give too much of a modern over-the-top action anime feel to the show: until I saw these last two episodes of the original. Suddenly, something that I had seen as a decent anime discussing themes of existentialism and Freudian psychology with a very beautiful and artistic ending film (the End of Evangelion) turned into, quite honestly, one of the most beautiful artistic masterpieces I have ever seen. 

I know the last two episodes get a lot of flak, so I just needed to say this."	t5_2r6ex	True

I mean, I liked all the action but once the show began getting more and more psychological, that's when it began to interest me the most. The last 2 episodes were the ones that really hooked me and made me realize that it's my favorite series. Yeah, I loved End of Evangelion as well and I really enjoyed the Rebuilds, but I never found any real fault to the ending of the original series. When I ask some of my other friends, they tell me they didn't really like the original ending because it left them wanting more. But isn't that a good thing?

This song plays after 1.0, where Shinji finally smiles at Rei, and 2.0, where Rei saves Shinji and everything will truly be okay.

In the scene where Rei saves Shinji, a song plays. The lyrics are, translated, ""If I could wish one thing of you, it would be for you to give me wings"".

At the end of 3.0, all hope is lost. It can be argued that the concept of hope was embodied in a physical object and was literally destroyed in the events of 3.0. Nothing good can possibly happen to Shinji in the world. But in the ending credits, the song says ""Everybody finds love in the end"".

Because of this and because of ideas expressed by the characters in the show, I think 4.0 will be at least ridiculously optimistic if not downright resplendent with happiness."	t5_2r6ex	True
1370272477.0	1fl1tu	A thought about Rei and soul splitting	elmergantry1960	26	5	11	"So I was trying to think about how Rei I, Rei II, and Rei III have such different character traits. If they all have the soul of Lillith at different times, why would they act differently? Both body and soul are the same. 

I believe that in Evangelion there are three separate parts of oneself: body, soul, and mind. 

The difference between the soul and the mind is essentially feeling and thought. One's soul tell the body how to act towards certain people whereas one's mind says why. Thus one's soul is where irrational emotion is based, such as love. The mind would carry the events that transpired as reason for the position od the soul. 

On to Rei. Rei I clearly was more extroverted than Rei II or III. She was, like many children are, full of herself because she thought her repetition of what her ""father"" was saying put her above others. Naoko clearly hated Rei I as soon as she realized it was Yui's clone. I doubt she'd be able to conceal these feelings and a rivalry formed between the two. Rei I's use of Gendo's words to hurt Naoko shows how she idolizes Gendo. 

I presume that Rei II appeared soon after Rei I's death so other members of NERV/Gehirn wouldn't be confused. I also imagine her death was covered up for the same reason. 

So now we have Rei II, who feels lost due to a lack of memory because Rei I's mind was not transferred to her, only her soul. She knows very few people from Rei I's lifetime. She still idolizes and listens to Gendo due to the soul transplanted, though she doesn't know why. This relationship forms a dependency like father and daughter. Gendo may treat her better than the rest of NERV, but he's still a cold, emotionally dead person. Rei lives in what looks like a laboratory. Everything's metallic and without life. Other than Gendo, she also sees Ritsuko often. Ristuko, who had seen what Rei had caused onto Naoko, hates Rei, but fears her at first as well because she didn't hear what Rei I had said to Naoko to cause the suicide. Because of this, Rei II does not enter a rivalry with Ritsuko, but is shown no affection. Due to growing u in this situation, Rei II develops her cold personality. 

Then episodes 1-22 happen. In this time, we all know how Rei II begins to come out of her shell and become less dependent on Gendo as she interacts with and, to some extent, befriends Shinji and Asuka. However, she never accomplishes attaining some sense of self-worth. She still is emotionally torn and dependent on others. The dependence has merely switched to a kinder recipient. During this period, she becomes more human-like in her interactions with others to a small extent. 

Then, due to Rei II's feelings of dependence on Shinji and lack of self-worth, she commits suicide in order to kill Armisael. Rei III is released from the Rei tank and thus becomes the container of Lillith's soul. However, her physical memories are lost due to the lack of transaction of Rei II's mind. This explains her confusion when meeting Shinji, yet she feels the feelings that Rei II felt. 

A scene later in the episode when Rei III breaks Gendo's glasses confirms that she's at the same point in soul progression as Rei II was. She dislikes Gendo because she sees that he is cold. However, she has no memory of how Gendo treats her. So breaking the glasses was done on a completely emotional level. 

TL;DR: Rei's mental state doesn't change when she changes bodes, but she doesn't remember what happened. Thus, the soul cannot contain both, so there must be a mind, separate from the soul.

1368169172.0	1e21lk	Adam/Lilith Theory. Somethings up, and I think I figured it out.	zerozap	28	7	12	"Just a realization I came to. 

So here goes, please point out if I missed something that totally proves or disproves this. 
In 3.33, we see 
--Lilith's rotting corpse.
--Mark 06 impaled on a Lance over Lilith's corpse. 
--Kaworu being cast down from '1st' angel to '13th' 
--Unit 13 ascending and starting 4th impact after consuming an angel core.
--Shinji was the 'backup'/'trigger'

In 2.22, we see 
--Unit 01 ascending and starting 3rd impact after merging with Rei/ angel core
--Gendo commenting that their unity was enough to trigger Unit-01
--Kaji commenting that Seele would be none too happy with this. 

We know that Rei is the vessel for Lilith.
We know that Kaworu is the vessel for Adam. 

Here's what I think is happening. From the TV show, we learn that Unit-01 is the only Eva 'born from Lilith' that is, created from tissue from Lilith as opposed to the other Evas, who have Adam to thank for being their closest relative. Time for some math.

Unit-01 (born from Lilith essence) 
+ Rei (Vessel of Liliths Soul) 
+ Shinji (trigger?/fruit of knowledge?) 
+ Angel (S2 organ?/Fruit of life?(I'm going to assume that when Unit-01 ripped the core out of the core, thats enough of Zeruel to count)) 
= Impact. 

Unit -13 (Mari refers to is as one of the surviving Adams) 
+ Kaworu (1st angel/ vessel of Adams soul in the TV show.) 
+ Shinji (Trigger/Fruit of knowledge again) 
+ 12th Angel (S2 Organ, Fruit of life) = Impact. 

Lilith's body rotting away was the real hint here, a NEW Lilith was born. At the end of 2.22, Unit -01 became the new Lilith, having both her body and her soul fused into one entity. 

Likewise with Unit-13, Kaworu states that he was cast down from 1st to 13th. This implies by his own admission that he is not Adam anymore. Something ELSE became the first angel, became Adam. Unit-13. 

Gendo's plan, whatever it may be, was to force Unit-01 to become Lilith, and Unit-13 to become Adam, something Seele never wanted or allowed. They sought to preserve the marshmellow body Lilith down in terminal dogma, which is why the Mark 06 was sent down there, putting Liliths body into stasis with the Lance. Stasis is one of the things the Lance is confirmed to do, and also why her body fully died once the lance was pulled out. 

So yeah, Unit-01 is now functionally everything Lilith was.
Unit-13 is functionally everything Adam was. Sounds handy if you're trying to engineer your very own specialty impact. (Read: Gendo) 
Because of this theory, I'ma bet we haven't seen the last of Unit-13. The final movie shoooould be fun.

1360066872.0	17xgml	Let's talk about 3.0 as a film. [SPOILERS EVERYWHERE]	Mykath	27	8	21	"*I've only been able to watch the camrip (and only watched it fully once) so I already am at a disadvantage with experiencing it, but I feel like I need to discuss the thoughts I'm having either way, as I really haven't seen some of the points I want to discuss even mentioned.*

Something I've been tossing back and forth in my head about 3.0 is its narrative direction. Obviously it is a stark contrast to 1.11 and 2.22, as well as something totally different from the series both in content and how its presented to us, the viewers. Whether or not we liked or disliked the movie (I personally have mixed feelings, especially with the shit Shinji pulls (literally) at the end), I do feel most of it was extremely intentional, and very successful as a piece.

3.0 is not a movie—it's treading the water towards being some kind of experimental film. Evangelion is already known for mind-fuckery and unconventional storytelling (25-26, motivated by budget cuts/End of Eva) This movie breaks further from our preconcieved expectations.

It's actually more akin to documentary. Gainax even has had experience in the past with documentary work and experimental storytelling with Otaku no Video (A story about a well adjusted college student who falls into otaku culture spliced with interviews (not sure if mockumentary or real interviews) of various otaku and their obcessions). Obviously, it's not a documentary in the form one may think of (Interviews, Archival Footage, Reenactments, etc), but I'd compare it to something along the lines of Symbiopsychotaxiplasm, a 1968 experimental documentary. It's a film where the directer has written a horrible script and has actors try and read it as he pretends to be a terrible director, seeing how far he can push them before something happens. 3.0 is not the same in terms of content or being so meta with itself, but it has a similar feel. In Symbiopsychotaxiplasm, it is presented in such a way that it directs the feelings of the viewer as the documentry goes along, and the audience begins to feel the same frustrations that the people working with the incompetent director.

We, the viewer, are placed in Shinji's shoes. The camera, as far as I recall, follows Shinji the entire movie, sans action scenes and the ship taking off. We are told nothing in the same way Shinji is told nothing and learn everything the moment he does. We feel his confusion, his happiness, his sorrow. We are to experience his emotions as if we were him.

However much it irked me that there was practically no character development and a lack of introduction to new characters, that is how we're supposed to feel. These, possibly, are feelings they wanted to convey because these are feelings Shinji had. They were not outwardly expressed the same way the rest of his emotions are, but they're there and we feel them.

3.0 is extremely polarized on how fans have felt about it. I am looking at it as an art piece instead of a movie, and any kind of avant-garde (that word feels very strange when referring to anime) work is very polarized in acceptance. Once 4.0 comes out we can make a judgement on the Rebuild series as a whole. I believe that this movie will be something to be looked back on for innovation and its experimental presentation.

*(I've actually written this post a couple times since the Camrip came out but only now feel like I have enough to say to post it. I'm also a relatively new fan of the series, only watching everything about a year ago and am still trying to wrap my head around some things.)*

1376109617.0	1k2nl6	Whose Ready for some Tinfoil?! A Thought About Eva 13.	TheColorsDo	21	2	13	"I've been thinking about this for a while and it strikes me as a little crazy. In order for it to work, you have to buy the sequel theory (I think there's a bit of a case for it, but if my assessment of others thinking is right, that theory has sort of been set aside). 

But, what if Eva 13 just *is* the original unit 01, like from the show. 

Here's my one good piece of evidence for this: Unit 01 (show) and Unit 13 (Rebuild) have an identical set of teeth. Check this shit out. 

[TV Unit 01](http://imgur.com/QwXPlWZ) and [Rebuild Unit 13](http://imgur.com/21WK31g). They have the same number of teeth and they're drawn in a near identical fashion (where the two front teeth on upper jaw are the same. Rebuild Unit 01's teeth are also different from the other two units. They key difference is that they're red, but also it has twelve teeth on each jaw piece where the TV 01 and Rebuild 13 have ten (admittedly the tv 01's teeth are somewhat inconsistent, but in all of the berserk shots there are only 10 on each jaw line). [Here](http://imgur.com/f3gWUUu), [here](http://imgur.com/2c1cwJ0), and [here](http://imgur.com/T3J6HIM) are some shots of Rebuild Unit 01. 

Another design oddity is that Unit 13 bears a striking resemblance to the TV Eva 01. It has some obvious differences, but the solid purple body and trimness of the unit look remarkably similar. 

So, teeth, right? Still pretty out there. Here are some benefits this idea has:

1. If Unit 13 is TV Unit 01, then it explains how its self powered. It's got an S2 Engine and doesn't need an external source. 
2. If Unit 13 is TV Unit 01, then it explains why the helmet shape is so similar.
3. I also think it helps make sense of why the ""awakened form"" it has is so different from the Rebuild Unit 01's awakening in 2.22. In EoE Shinji lost control of the Unit 01 during instrumentality, just like he and Kaworu (for some of the time) lost control of this unit. I think some of the pre-awakening stuff (where Shinji just gets total control) was an added control system feature, but during the impact Unit 13 seems to be doing its own thing until Kowaru uses his space magic. This is completely unlike Rebuild 01's awakening where Shinji has some kind of control (his agency is intact in some sense, he's getting Rei out of their, but the 'real world' side of things seems to be a side effect of the spirit/soul stuff he's doing). If E13 is TV01 there's a sort of precedent for that loss of control. There's even a parallel scene in EoE and 3.33 where Shinji is jamming on the controls. 
4. It also explains how Shinji can just get in and control this unit. I think that the Rebuild continuity has largely shed the mother's as control system thing. Curiously, its mentioned in 3.33 and its only Yui and 01. I think its clear that Rebuild Unit 01 has to be under Rebuild Yui's control for the Berserk mode to make sense (she takes control then, even if it only happens in battle in 1.11 and when she's refusing the dummy system in 2.22). But, I think that scene is also reminding old viewers that this was the case for TV01 too, the only surviving unit from the show. And, its shown just ahead of 13's launch. (as an aside, I have a potentially less crazy theory that that scene is shown to establish that while Rebuild Unit 01 is controlled by Yui, Unit 13 is controlled by part of Gendo, due to Fuyutsuki's line about him losing part of his soul to accomplish his goals, it's just taking that line literally in conjunction with the Yui reveal)

Clearly there are some issues. 
1. It's pretty crazy and its based a lot on teeth. 
2. You need to buy the multi-verse or sequel theory for it to work. 
3. It raises the question of how they would even get TV Unit 01 from space. But, they cleverly show us how they would get that a Unit from space by showing Wille retrieving Rebuild Unit 01 from space. Conceivably Nerv has access to similar technology and it probably isn't that insane to suggest that TV Unit 01 hasn't wandered to far from Earth (but, it may have).
4. Unit 13 has an extensive array of modifications, namely the arms and the double entry system.
5. It makes the awakening scene very odd because it already is a god-like entity with fruit of life and fruit of knowledge. The only thing I can think of here is that it has to go through this other process to ""play nice"" with the Rebuild lore. Things are clearly different in this world. 
6. Mari kind of confirms that its an Adam, but Mari doesn't give a definitive statement about it.

So it has some pros and cons. Typing this out makes it seem fucking nuts, but I figure I'd put it out there for people to mull over. I think the design and the teeth mean something, even if its just a nod to the sort of capabilities the TV01 had. The bit about the control system is also pretty interesting. 

That said, I probably favor my other theory about Gendo investing himself in 13's control system. I can spell that out in a different post if people would like to hear that (I think it makes the Eva13 is a 'dark' Eva01 idea more compelling). That said, that could just be one of the modifications it gets even if it is a remodeling of TV01. 

So, how crazy is this idea? Right? 

TL;DR: 3.33's Unit 13 is literally the television series/EoE's Eva01.

I often just want to be able to chat with you guys even if it's not about EVA. However, this is /r/evangelion, so it's best if the posts are about Evangelion. 

But, to feed this sense of community, the mod team and I have decided to introduce friday chat threads. This will be the only post unrelated to NGE and not removed as spam. It will only happen once a week and only on fridays. 

Simply, a mod will make a post (meaning if you make the chat thread and you are not a mod, it will be deleted) with a question for us to discuss and have a good time with. These questions will be chosen at random (using random.org) and will be drawn from a pool of questions that you guys send to us through the mod mail feature (just look at the sidebar and click ""message the mods""). Any type of question will be allowed as long as it doesn't break reddiquette. However, if the mod team decides that a question would lead to a poor thread, then it won't be selected. 

The mods will try to make the post around 12 am GMT-5 (US Eastern time). Our first post will be this friday. The format of the post will be

    Friday Chat Thread: username asks ""question""

Anyways, I hope this works out well. Leave you opinion on if you like this idea, if it should be changed in some way, or if you just support it leave a comment anyways saying so. "	t5_2r6ex	True

1368869005.0	1ekivu	My brilliant drunken idea for an Evangelion game set during the Rebuild timeskip.	androx87	22	4	4	"OK, so it's Friday night, had a few rum and cokes while playing my 360, and suddenly I got a craving to watch some Eva. I boot up the 360 youtube app and watch a few of my favorite scenes: Asuka mind-rape, Tabris doing his thing in ep 24, Asuka fighting the MP Evas, Third Impact, rebuild Ramiel, etc. Eventually I got to the 3.33 stuff and I thought to myself ""Why in the hell do we not have a game tie-in for the Rebuilds?"" So as I sat there, controller in one hand, drink in the other, Kinect watching my every move, my mind began to formulate an interactive Eva experience. This is the sum of that thought process.

Note: I assume this is a 360 game because of my use of the Kinect, but who the hell knows what next gen has to offer.

The game would be primarily 1st person cockpit view with standard FPS controls, and the ability to switch between ranged and melee modes. In ranged mode, you would have a standard L aiming/R firing control scheme, used mainly for rifles and other projectile weapons. In melee mode, each trigger would control an arm of the Eva; Squeezing the trigger would give analogue control over how far the arm extends, and the corresponding thumbstick would control movement of the arm. Weapons ranging from prog knives to the Lance of Longinus could be used in this mode.

Voice commands via Kinect (or similar next-gen devices) could be used, especially for management of your power reserves and AT Field (c'mon, who here hasn't imagined yelling ""AT Field zenkai!""?), and maybe for calling in support fire from your faction (I will get to those in a bit). 

The really cool part happens when you use voice commands to enter a ""beast mode"" state. In this mode, the view switches to 3rd person, and the game (using Kinect or similar device) translates your body movements 1:1 to the Eva. In this mode you will have an enhanced ability to break through enemy AT Fields, but a limited battery capacity.

So now that the game mechanics are out of the way: the story mode. Every new game will start off in a tutorial mode, immediately after Kaworu and the MK. 6 lance Unit 01. You will create a custom character (Another child from the Marduke Report), and arrive at the Geofront right as the U.N. is beginning it's invasion/takeover of the facility. After a few tutorial lessons, you can chose to side with either NERV/SEELE, or the U.N./WILLE. During campaign missions you earn credits/resources to outfit and customize your Eva or enhance your base (Geofront/NERV HQ for NERV, Wunder and fleet for WILLE)

The game would also feature different classes, focusing on melee, ranged, or support (like Mari in 3.33) for both campaign Co-op and competitive persistent world multiplayer. 

In the main competitive multiplayer mode Eva pilots from each side will battle to the death to claim territories around the world. NERV and WILLE will compete for control of areas of the world. To aid in the fight, NERV can delpoy the Nemesis series, and WILLE can deploy battleships, depending on which faction has the most influence in the region.

Please, for the love of Lilith, someone involved with the Rebuilds see this and take my ideas and make them a reality."	t5_2r6ex	True

&gt; Also, Argue with my points if you believe they are wrong!!! I cannot stress this enough as it only helps us to come to a more thorough conclusion on the matter.

Lookie who it is! Unit1pt0 back with an expanded theory!

Alright to start this off, I'm sure a lot of you have heard of the belief that Kaworu **IS** Shinji. What I'm not sure of is if there is already any evidence to actually give depth to that myth/possible fact, which is what I'll talk about now. Take care for those of you who haven't seen 3.0 yet as there will be potential spoilers ahead

* Point 1

Asuka states that the reason behind her young age in 3.0 is due to the ""Curse of the EVA"". Which leads us to believe that those who have piloted an Evangelion will remain ageless from the day they first enter the unit onwards, ageless may also mean immortal to all illnesses where violence/physical harm is not the cause. If Kaworu is in fact Shinji then we can come to the conclusion that the EVA has made him immortal and that he has remained hidden for most of history.

* Point 2

Kaworu's resentment to acknowledge Gendo by name. This one may sound odd but follow me here. Watching both 2.0, 3.0 and in the original Neon Genesis series has Kaworu ever properly acknowledged Gendo? Sounds like one of Shinji's traits, what if Kaworu/Shinji after surviving the tang-pocalypse (EoE) has finally evolved to hate Gendo's existence entirely as if seeing what he did as unforgivable? Explains why he's in a good mood most of his appearance, revenge would be sweet. Even going as far to call him the ""King of Lilim"" instead of ""Commander"" or his name.

* Point 3

As Gendo and Fuyutsuki arrive at the moon and are denied access to its surface they see Kaworu sitting on the hand of the still in construction EVA Unit 6, upon sighting G&amp;F hovering he remarks: http://i.imgur.com/1GMQDlu.jpg

Father? Don't let this clash with Point 2, Sure he may say it but no-one (apart from the viewer) can hear it.

* Point 4

Kaworu's ability to synchronize at any level with an EVA plus mastery of the A-T Field. We can attribute this to he holding the soul of Adam within him, but what if over the course of his thousands/millions of years of immortality (Being Shinji and surviving the End of Evangelion) and knowledge of how to operate it with EVA, but applying it to himself that he could had learnt to control his A-T field? It would help to explain how he had remained hidden for so long in the sense that if he can use his A-T field to hover/fly and with his immortality, he hid on the moon? Returning to earth during the Second Impact of the Rebuild saga to ""hijack"" (I use that term loosely) ADAM's soul and align himself with SEELE?

* Point 5

Age. Kaworu is labeled as 15 years old when he first enters an EVA/when he first appears in the series. We are given 15 as that is the amount of years passed since the second impact. Odd how he's the odd one out, with all other pilots being 14 (Rei, Asuka, Shinji.) and he being the only 15 year old. Hell, even Touji is 14 and he was given a brief shot at piloting EVA. It seems pretty adamant that 14 is the golden age of pilots. Plus wouldn't the stature of someone 15 years old be drawn differently in the animation, as with all media released thus far Shinji and Kaworu share the same height and shape. Most characters his age have different heights (See: Shinji vs Touji, Kensuke, Mari, Asuka) Taking me to my next point...

* Point 6

Character Design. Kaworu has an excessively similar design to Shinji. Things such as...

1. Height being the same (http://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/4ee52dc1c0d1395185303dbffca174341350737065_full.jpg, though Kaworu has a slightly taller look due to angle of neck and head)

2. Body shape remaining similar (http://25.media.tumblr.com/6b8ec4e651bed227f685b3a612342188/tumblr_mlr74vd2IN1r1svz3o1_1280.png).

3. Chin/Facial structure (http://wiki.evageeks.org/images/c/ca/26_C343_shinji-grin.jpg and http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/40/Eva24DC_Kaworu.jpg/230px-Eva24DC_Kaworu.jpg). Ie, characters can deviate from similar design by having a rounded or square chin, but Anno seems to have done this intentionally. Even ear shape is the same.

4. Even having them wear the same clothing, from casual wear down to plug-suit design.

* Point 7

His fondness towards himself, wanting to comfort the present Shinji in a world where everyone shows resentment. When he says he ""loves"" Shinji (neon genesis) he probably means in a way that complacent with being proud, and definitely not like the general community/dreaded yaoi-fangirls have taken out of proportion.

1367191829.0	1dauvv	[3.33 SPOILERS] Touji placement theory/ Cruel EVA Theory	Unit1pt0	22	4	27	"Following NexusT's theory which seems to make the most sense right now. 
(and can be found here: http://www.reddit.com/r/evangelion/comments/1d9llq/spoilers_eva333_this_is_going_to_sound_ridiculous/).

My theory in relation to NexusT is that if there was a true third impact during the intermission period, then Touji did in fact become an EVA pilot. If you follow NexusT's theory there is a need for a third party to throw another Lance of Longinus into the developing Lilith to stop her growth. He eventually dies. And NERV recycles his school uniform that was kept with them as shinji lost his during near third impact.

My own theory goes and splits apart from Nexus's theory like this.

Touji, Working for NERV, as Wille hasn't been created yet and sides haven't effectively split yet. Then fights alongside Mari (possibly asuka as well if she had recovered) in that UN vs NERV battle royale. Lilith is activated by a ""Rei clone/Dummy plug autonomous Eva"" and starts to grow. A new spear is found amongst the fight (after SEELE possibly Launches their mass production EVA's with spears). Asuka (if recovered, which is likely) and Mari's new mission is stopping Lilith's growth, they are successfu, Touji has taken the place of Shinji in being offered by the Mass Production Eva's to Lilith like in EoE,  He however doesn't go through all the psych due to the interuption by Asuka and Mari but is left unretrievable from space.

My so called ""Touji placement theory"" has a deeper meaning than giving Touji a place to fill the role, but it also means that the Evangelion Universe is based on Fatalism (The belief you'll die at a predetermined time of any cause). I'll call this the ""Cruel EVA Theory"", I state this because every death has been according to the original Evangelion reality. Kaworu's death in central dogma, Rei's death at the hands of an angel and return in clone form, Touji's death now adds to the list. This means Asuka will eventually die and possibly reincarnate. At the end of the Rebuilds if I'm right, and Rei clone will again assist gen do with Mari being the only person that can break the cycle.

It makes sense for Gendo to see Yui and Rei, since they were both very important to him, but why is Kaworu there? There is no indication that Gendo and Kaworu were close, or even spoke to one another. Given the way that both Rei and Kaworu seem to be guiding Shinji throughout the whole process of Instrumentality, I think Kaworu (and maybe Rei as well) is there to allow Shinji to judge whether or not to tang Gendo as well. After all, Shinji is basically creating his perfect world at this point, and that most certainly means a world without his father. The last we see of Gendo is just his bottom half, but it hasn't reverted to LCL."	t5_2r6ex	True
