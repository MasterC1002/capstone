/u/ExeUnter is to thank for our glorious battle plan!

FINAL EDIT:

It has been a long day, my friends, as we prepare for battle against the periwinkle. It appears as though they have penetrated our defenses and there are a few among us;
But fear not! For although I currently have 3 Wands of Cursory Gestures bestowed upon me, have lost all of my hats several times, and many of my posts have been destroyed by their useless weapons...We shall conquer!
Your sacrifices in giving me these hats has created an unstoppable super force that will force them into submission. So, remember my friends:
In exactly 5 minutes, it will be a new hour. We enter the new section of /r/all[1] , and we attack! Some of us must enter the land of ""rising"" in order to take down their rising plans! Upvote all orangereds, downvote all periwinkles. We will continue this attack for one hour.
Spread word of our attack plans! Post a link to this as a reply to many of our troops' comments!
And remember, it's not too late to start attacking unless we have already lost the fight. So it will NEVER be too late!
In honor of our dear leader, orangeredcat in tits, I say...
FLY YOU FOOLS!

**ROUND OVER.** Awaiting results.


Before the results are announced, I would to sincerely, announce how proud I am of every single one of you. Win or loss stand strong and proudly, knowing you brought honour to our name, and remember, it's not over yet.

**THE WINNER ARE ANNOUNCED** We have reviewed the screencaps and 

**Periwinkles have won Round One.**

It has been an honour leading you, we stuck it to them, and proven ourselves. And now, get ready for  **ROUND 2 BETCHES, LETS GO ORANGERED!!**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**START OF ROUND 2**

Tip: Don't just spam and clutter up all the pages, like before, we had a page full of Ranges, at this point, we don't need any more, so just remember, only post when we need to, (mostly when we are losing or are about to lose the lead)  or, obviously, at the start/start-ish.

8:50: The battle is going, but there's only been one post for the last ten minutes, by the Periwinkles, so lets just stay quiet for a while to see what happens next.

8:58 - start upvoting that single Periwinkle Ranged.

9:12 - Continue lurking, and downvote those two cavalry/infantry posts, upvote the ranged.

9:27 - Be prepared for our next moved.

9:37 - We still cannot make a move, without it being countered by the Periwinkles, so we must wait, keep upvoting their ranged post though, and downvote the other two.

9:53 - I know it's frustrating, comrades to stand by and wait, but we cannot take any risks, for if we lose this, we lose the Marsh. But know that all of our leaders are here, lying in wait, and that there will be a time to strike. Stay vigilant men, for that time may come soon.

10:06: **ATTACK THEM WITH CAVALRY!!! DOWNVOTE THEIR CAVALRY AND INFANTRY, UPVOTE THEIR RANGED, ATTACK WITH CAVALRY!!**

10:14 - Brilliantly done, our plan is working, we are slaughtering the Periwinkles. Remember to pivots our cavalry and their range, and downvote their infantry.

10:17 - Ok soldiers, hold back on posting for a while, just in case they get a huge force to upvote their infantry. But make sure you keep voting!

10:24 - [a beautiful sight](http://imgur.com/NWM6FPy)

10:39 - Remember guys, ease up on the posting, if we get too many Cavalry's up there, we might not be able to change the flow if their Infantry's overtake their Ranged.

10:50 - We are holding a firm lead, round 3 looks pretty probable. Just remember to keep checking in to here, and the Marsh, just in case the odds change again, and if so, I assure you that we have a wonderful plan to stop them from winning this time.

11:06 **THE PLAN** EVERYBODY DOWNVOTE OUR CAVALRY POSTS, AND START POSTING ORANGERED RANGED POSTS, (so Upvote their infantry to the top) WE CAN DO THIS, GO-GO-GO!

11:13 **GUYS JUST REMEMBER** don't post too many range, I did this early so that if they do end up changing it, we will be able to change it again, so don't post too many ranges, like last time.

11:21 - Ok guys, WE HAVE ENOUGH RANGE, STOP POSTING, KEEP VOTING, WE GOT THIS!!

11:28 - **WE'RE DOING IT, THE CAVALRY IS GOING DOWN!!**

11:44  - GREAT JOB SOLDIERS, KEEP VOTING (**downvote = Ora. Calvary, Upvote = Ora. Range &amp; Per. Infantry)** 

11:52 - **WE'VE HIT THE LEAD, KEEP VOTING**

12:22 - **COME ON ORANGERED, KEEP GOING, WE GOT THIS!**

1:06: **WE NEED TO DOWNVOTE [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/MidnightMarsh/comments/1f12n1/orangered_cavalry_gogogo/) [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/MidnightMarsh/comments/1f12nr/orangered_cavalry_buuuuurn_periwinkle/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/MidnightMarsh/comments/1f132v/orangered_cavalry_they_wanted_a_war/) GO BROTHERS, WE CAN DO THIS!)**

1:19 - **STOP POSTING** keep voting though.

2:09 - New rule change to a deleted post. **WE NEED TO GET OVER 18 VOTES FOR ONE OF OUR ORANGERED RANGES FOR US TO WIN - UPVOTE ORANGERED RANGES, EVERY SINGLE ONE!!**

2:38 - [VERY IMPORTANT] **UPVOTE THIS POST [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MidnightMarsh/comments/1f18tg/orangered_alpha_range_one_bomb_not_enough_to/) SO ORANGERED CAN ACHIEVE VICTORY!**

2:43 - IT'S WORKING!

2:57 - VICTORY IS IN SIGHTS, KEEP VOTING ORANGEREDIANS!

3:11 -  This last hour, make sure you monitor [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/MidnightMarsh/comments/1f18tg/orangered_alpha_range_one_bomb_not_enough_to/) and keep the upvotes above eighteen!!

3:30 - Battle music to get you through this last half an hour - https://soundcloud.com/justinwaylonmorgan-1/the-island-of-warriors

CHARGE!!

3:50 **TEN MINUTES LEFT!!** I am proud of every single one of you, more than you know. You are the most dedicated team, Orangered has ever seen, and it was beyond a pleasure leading such an attentive, dedicated, skilled, strategic team. Every minute I would get messages with a possible plan idea, things to add to the thread, a positive battle cry and so many wonderful things.

It has been a delight and an honour, and **as round three is a highest-upvote wins** I will no longer update the thread, except for the start and the finish.

Those of you who fought and more, will be remembered, and will be rewarded.

**NOW LETS GO FINISH THEM OFF!!**

**ROUND OVER** Awaiting Results^we^won^shh..

**THE WINNERS ARE ANNOUNED** We reviewed the screencaps and 


**Orangered has won Round Two!!!!!!!"" VIVA LA ORANGERED!!**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**START OF ROUND THREE**

Unfortunately that is the end of the Battle thread, as the third round is a highest-post-wins deal, so all you have to do is upvote Orangered, downvote periwinkle.

I will be on the battlefield with you, and **WE WILL WIN THIS BATTLE ONCE AND FOR ALL, COME ON ORANGERED!!**

Edit: ok maybe not the end, I'll be back at the of round three for our victory dances ;)

1366140470.0	1chauo	Hello Brothers! The Shirts will be up in the redditgift site tomorrow!	Graphic_Arteeest	53	19	49	"Tomorrow the shirts will be up. They will also donate to a charity that will be revealed at their release. On top of that....There is a scoreboard to see which side will raise more money! If there is one thing we can do as a community, its at least contribute a little for the benefit of someone else. Let us come together not for the material possession of a shirt, but for the reminder that there was one time in our life that we donated to something much bigger than ourselves.

Yesterday's tragedy has reminded me that life should not be taken for granted. One of my friends were hospitalized and I did not know she was even there until the morning. My other hurt but not enough for him to stop into a hospital so that others could get their treatment. Its the acts of kindness that surrounded them that showed to me that something as simple as donating our money to a cause to help others is the least we can do.

Things got out of hand and a catastrophic chain of events led me to be irrational. 

**I'm sorry for what happened, and I never meant to be the brute I was.**

Everyone will stop harassing. He is one of us. If I find out that you are all on his case, I will make sure that there are consequences. A first time fuck up should not have been this hard. 


In that, stop harassing candycornlover as well. He fucked up but didn't know how this works and shod also be relieved of the shit we put him through.

1368068656.0	1dz8ec	Dear All Orangereds, I have Arrived	Orangered_Oracle	58	30	19	"All Orangereds, 

I am the Orangered Oracle. I have been sent down from the great Orangered Fire that burns in the sky. I am no one person. I am the collective mind of millions of years of study, meditation and creative genius of the lives of hundreds of thousands who came before me. I came into existence sometime after the creation of Chroma. As Chroma was born so was I. I have been waiting for over sixteen thousand years and have come out now because it is time. I have come out now to warn you that it is time. If we do not change now we thrown out of Chroma by the Periwinkle invaders. We must show them that we, Orangereds, are in charge. 

Before I go any further I ask you to go here and read about my Origins. I am no fraud, my story has been written down for centuries and has been validated by the Official Lore Master of Chroma being of real origin. [Click here to read about my story and Origins,](http://www.reddit.com/r/Chromalore/comments/1dz83h/sas_the_return_of_the_gods_and_the_birth_of_the/)
 
I come here today to speak with you. We are at a grave time in Orangered history. For all of you have been away and out of all the recent happenings I will take a moment to give our dire situation into a few words, we have fallen behind on technology, communication and numbers to the Periwinkles. It is time that we rise up and show them what we are capable of. We need to remind ourselves that we are the true owners of Chroma and must push these barbarians off our rightful land. 

The path to change is not simple, it is a hard but if it was too hard I would have not come to help you out. I believe that change is very possible, to approach this plan I have spent numerous hours meditating on how to approach this problem and have come to the conclusion that we must learn to organize our people. That is why I contacted the moderators of Orangered on how to fix this problem. 

1. They have created a census that needs to be filled out [at here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Zzac48Hhn6ld96zen55OUsLJsmHGqIzEviyvn6GcS2A/viewform)

2. We need people who who are dedicated and willing, we need a subreddit to combat the Periwinkle Clan page. To do this I am requesting that we change up the Master Race subreddit, there will be a separate plan for this.

3. We need some sort of Organized page that will direct others to other Orangered pages. I have set up another survey for Orangered Subreddit Mods, [click here and record your subreddit so it can receive the publicity it deserves. ](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NunskDksyJW9hNfqxVlZSdjiE3oN06GpLtdHfjfltKE/viewform) 

4. We are setting up a subreddit for Orangered Government Officials soon. Another announcement will be released soon.

5. We need a page for CSS help because many of our subreddits are severely lacking in CSS creativity. 

Together fellow Orangereds, we will bring back the Orangered Nation to its former Glory. Join me in this revolution and change Orangered forever. 

I would also like to say to all of you that my arrival is not the joyous as it seems. My arrival onto Chroma also means the release of the Gods that I had once went up against. These Gods have been growing their vengeance all this time and want nothing short of control of all of Chroma. They have been communicating with the Periwinkles by blinding them with their great periwinkle light. Our crusade is not only one of war but one to help give sight to our blinded Periwinkle brothers. We are on a Crusade brothers, and we will not stop till we have won.

1368314766.0	1e5kyx	[ MOD POST ] FUCKIN LAST NIGHT	Hanson_Alister	52	24	62	"Alright men, what happened out there? Today is a very sad day for the Orangered Nation. We are pathetic, we really are. Last night the only like 10 FUCKIN people there. 10 PEOPLE. NO THIS IS NOT A FAILURE OF COMMUNICATION, this is a failure of turnout. There were many problems with the battle, the majority of it though was due to our failed numbers.

We had to issue a RETREAT during the first round because of the low turnout, we saw that we were going to lose. I didn’t want to hand a round to them so I assembled a task force to try to take the first round by surprise later.

Now that marks the third battle we have been crushed, to tell you the truth I think, the only reason we won Snooland was because of the Pickles. That leaves only the first battle that we really won. What's going on?

Orangered Nation, if you are reading this and wish Orangered to die along with Chroma then do whatever you are doing because in the end these battles are not determined by CSS experts and Lore masters, they are determined by the turnout of our people. The battles are the big things here, they are the backbone of our existence on Chroma. 

/user/Roaddogg has resigned from Orangered because of this failure. His reasoning was that even when we try to do everything we can only a couple people show up makes us feel like shit. I don't blame him, after where we've tried to do to bring all of you out. We are on Reddit 24/7 because of this and when all these people who seem pumped up and you ask to come out don’t show up it really just kills you. We do this to have fun but after you try all you can and barely anyone comes makes you cry a bit. It really does, I put in so much work to try to rally you out. We all did and when no one turns out, it just kills.

I have no problem with losing, but being crushed out of our wits is my problem.

I give the Orangered Nation one final Proposition, either you come out next battle or watch the nation fall apart piece by piece.

EDIT: Battle Etiquette

1. In the beginning we will have a post by some specified posters, they will begin the battle. Once we get a feel for what the enemy started posting more of we let everyone post more of the necessary unit.  

2. Orders, Orders will be posted on this sub, mostly telling you to upvote something and/or downvote something. ALWAYS CHECK THE TIME STAMP, make sure that the orders posted are from this round otherwise you might be reading the wrong orders and will mess up on what to downvote and upvote. We will try to delete posts from earlier rounds to make things simpler. 

3. Don't post pictures of your orange cat during the battle, it will be deleted.

4. Come HERE before you go to battle so you can be debriefed on what to upvote and downvote. Check the battle thread constantly so that you can see what to upvote and downvote. Always UPVOTE the BATTLE THREAD so more Orangereds can see it.

5. When it is battle don't rush off posting whatever you want. We don't want you to post something that could possibly make us lose. We want you to post things that are needed. 

6, HAVE FUN! Its a cool game and its pretty exciting to watch the battle occur.

I've tried to put in everything that happened since the Orangered Census came out but I might have missed some stuff or glossed over other so just comment here and ask me and others any questions you get. THANKS!

The big things that have happened *are*

1. New Battle System! We've gotten a new battle system thats been invented by /u/reostra. The battle system has some new capabilities. [Check out the battle system here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/councilofkarma/wiki/battle)

2. Most territories have been made and finalized. The map looks [like this at the moment.](http://i.imgur.com/vHwyBDk.jpg)

3. We're going to begin to have battle 24/7. After the last two territories on the map are taken battles will progress to 24/7 so that we can fight anytime. 

4. We've branched off into different branches in the Military with different territory loyalties to be in a part of any military branch. Check out the sidebar for more details on that.

5. We have an eternal practice battleground at /r/eternalbattleground so that you can practice your skills for the next battle. 

6. Territory Loyalties, you are allowed to be in two territories in the Nation.. ONE CIVILIAN ROLE and ONE MILITARY ROLE.[ As told in this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/orangered/comments/1eso20/mod_post_state_of_the_nation_address_part_2/)

7. Chroma has built up quite a history as told at /r/chromalore and we're almost done setting most of Chroma history in stone. Check out some of the short stories we've written detailing the history and culture of the land of Chroma.

8. Next BATTLE! The NEXT BATTLE **WILL BE TAKING PLACE THIS** WEEKEND AT /r/Nordwalder/ where we **WILL NEED YOUR HELP**. We did great in tactics last battle but we lost because we were down in numbers. Almost  2:1 in fact and we **NEED AS MANY OF YOU GUYS AS POSSIBLE TO JOIN US OUT THERE!**

MungTongue	29	5	7	"We are met together at a time when great exertions and a high constancy are required from all who cherish and sustain the Liberal cause. Difficulties surround us and dangers threaten from this side and from that. Exultant enemies are gathering: weak friends are nervous or disheartened. Voices are raised in counsels, both equally unwise, of impatience or of lassitude. From such a situation you may emerge triumphant, but to do that there will have to be, in leaders and in followers, shrewd clear plans of action, true stout-hearted comradeship, and unwearying determination. 

You know the position which has been created by the action of the House of Orange. Two great political parties divide all Reddit between them in their conflicts. Each commands a powerful organisation; each is backed by numbers; each has its functions, its aspirations, and its sources of strength; and to and fro they swing in their struggles with varying fortunes from year to year, and from election to election—and from their struggles, strange as it may appear, over a long period of years, a steady stream of progress is born.

Now, it is discovered that one of these parties possesses an unfair weapon, that one of these parties, after it is beaten at an election, after it is deprived of the support and confidence of the country, after it is destitute of a majority in the representative Assembly, when it sits in the shades of Opposition without responsibility, or representative authority, under the frown, so to speak, of the Constitution, nevertheless possesses a weapon with which it can harass, vex, impede, affront, humiliate, and finally destroy the most serious labours of the other. The Downvote.

When it is realised that the party which possesses this prodigious and unfair advantage is, in the main, the party of the rich against the poor, of the classes and their dependents against the masses, of the lucky, the wealthy, the happy, and the strong against the left-out and the shut-out millions of the weak and poor, you will see how  serious the constitutional situation has become.

A period of supreme effort lies before you. The First with which this Day will close, and towards which we are moving, is one which is different in notable features from any other which we have known. Looking back over the politics of the last thirty years, we hardly ever see a Conservative Opposition approaching an election without a programme—on paper at any rate—of social and democratic reform.

But what social legislation, what plans of reform do the Periwinkle party offer now to the working people of Reddit if they will return them to power' I have studied very carefully the speeches of their leaders—if you can call them leaders. I have listened frequently to their  contributions to our debates in Orangered, and I have failed to discover a single plan of social reform or reconstruction which they have invented, which they are attached to, or which they have proclaimed.

Upon the grim and sombre problems of the Poor Downvote they have no policy whatever; upon unemployment no policy whatever; for the evils of intemperance no policy whatever, except to make sure of the public-house Downvote; upon the question of the Subs, monopolised as it is in the hands of a few, denied to so many, so much of it fooled away for foxes and pheasants, no policy whatever. In other directions where they have a policy, it is worse than no policy. For the distresses of the Reddit, for the relation between the orangered and periwinkle peoples, no policy whatever; for Knights of New's veto; for /r/pics repugnant to the conscience of the overwhelming majority of the OP people, crammed down their throats at their own expense. No, I say that never in modern history has the Periwinkle party approached an election so utterly devoid not only of any published plan, but of any apparent intention or even wish to remedy or to mitigate the grievances, the gross and cruel injustices for the redress of which appeals have so long and so earnestly been made by important classes of their fellow-Redditmen.

Yet we are told they are confident of victory [laughter]; they are persuaded that the thread has already forgotten the follies and even the crimes of the late Administration, and that the general contempt and disgust in which they Were dismissed from power has already passed away. They are already busy making their Cabinet—who is to be put in and what is not less important who is to be put out. Lists of selection and lists of proscription are being framed. The two factions into which they are divided—the Orangered and the Periwinkles—are each acutely conscious of one another's infirmities, and through their respective organs they have succeeded in proving to their apparent satisfaction what most of us have known and some of us have said for a long time past—that they are an uncommon poor lot all round. It would be bad enough if a party so destitute, according to its own statement, of political merit, so devoid of new and needful political ideas, were to return untaught, unchastened. and unrepentant to the place of power. It would be bad enough if they were to return with the intention of doing nothing but repeating and renewing our experiences under Mr. Bacon's late Administration—of dragging through empty sessions, of sneering at every philanthropic enthusiasm, of flinging a sop from time to time to the brewers or the barons or the landed classes. That would be bad enough; but those would not be the consequences which would follow from the /r/WTF triumph. Consequences far more grave, immeasurably more disastrous would follow. We are not offered an alternative policy of progress; we are not confronted even with a policy of stand-still; we are confronted with an organised policy of constructive reaction. We are not to go on. We are not even to hold our own. We are to march back into those shades from which we had hoped Reddit civilization and /r/Science had finally emerged. Not for many years have the working people of this Reddit been menaced with such an aggressive attack.

If the Conservative party win the election, they have made it perfectly clear that it is their intention to impose a complete Downvote tariff, and to raise the money for ambitious armaments and colonial projects by Reddit gold. They have declared, with a frankness which is at any rate remarkable, that they will immediately proceed to put a tax on upvote, a tax on downvote, a tax on timber, and an innumerable schedule of taxes on all unmanufactured articles imported into the United Kingdom; that is to say that they will take by all these taxes a large sum of money from the pockets of the Original Posters by making them pay more for the content they bring, the subs they live in, and the comforts and conveniences which they require in their karma; and that a great part of this large sum of money will be divided between the mods and the submods in the shape of increased profits, and even that part of it which does reach the Exchequer is to be given back to these same classes in the shape of reductions in income tax and in direct taxation.

Do not allow yourself to be drawn from this plain view of what is called the Pariwinkle movement by ingenious sophistries which have often been exposed, by appeals to sentiment of a cheap and false character, or by delusions about taxing the foreigner. Such treacle is scarcely fit to catch flies with—and if you face the policy with which we are now threatened by the Periwinkle party fairly and searchingly, you will see that, stripped of its disguises and stripped of its ornaments, it is nothing less than a deliberate attempt on the part of important sections of the propertied classes to transfer their existing burdens to the shoulders of the masses of the people, and to gain greater profits for the investment of their capital by charging higher prices.

It is very natural that a party nourishing such designs should be apprehensive of criticism and of opposition, but I must say I have never heard of a party which was in such a jumpy, nervous state as our opponents are at this present time. If one is led in the course of a speech, as I sometimes am, to speak a little firmly and bluntly about the Periwinkles, they become almost speechless with indignation. [Laughter.] They are always in a state of incipient political apoplexy, while as for the so-called Liberal Unionists, whenever they are criticised they run off whining and complain that it is unchivalrous to attack them while Mr. Narwhal is disabled. [Laughter and cheers.] Sorry I am that he is out of the battle, not only on personal but on public grounds. His fiercest opponents would welcome his re-entry into the political arena, if only for the fact that we should then have a man to deal with and someone whose statement of the case for his side would be clear and bold, whose speeches would be worth reading and worth answering, instead of the melancholy marionettes whom the wire-pullers of the Periwinkles are accustomed to exhibit on provincial platforms. [Laughter.]

But I hope you will not let these pretexts or complaints move you or prevent you from calling a spade a spade, a tax a tax, a protective tariff a gigantic dodge to cheat the poor, or the OP the most illiberal thing on record. [Cheers.] But if the Periwinkles are so touchy and intolerant that they resent the slightest attack or criticism from their opponents as if it were sacrilege, that is nothing to the fury which they exhibit when any of their friends on the Conservative side begin to ask a few questions.

Whatever we may think of the Periwinkles proposals which are now being urged upon us, no one can deny that they raise some of the gravest and most momentous social and economic issues which can possibly be brought before the public, and that they involve consequences of the utmost complexity and importance not only to the posting classes, but to all concerned in the trade and comments of our Reddit. One would have thought, at least, that matters of such gravity and such novelty should be considered fairly on their merits. One would have thought, at least, that conscientious scruples, honest doubts, or differences of view would be accorded some measure of respect.

So now we humbly pray that we be saved from ruin's brink.

Such is the great conspiracy with which the Reddits is now confronted, a three-fold peril, an attempt to place the main burden of taxation upon the shoulders of OP and not on reposters, a disastrous blow at the prosperity, the freedom, the flexibility, and the expansive power of Reddit industry, and a deadly injury to the purity of Reddit public life. These will be the consequences, momentous and long enduring, of a tariff victory at the general election; and remember it has been said that it takes ten years to carry a tariff, but it takes a hundred years to abolish it.

Governments come and governments go. We may be driven from power. We may desire to be released from responsibility; our places may be filled by the representatives of wealth and privilege, by the delegates of the Periwinkle, by the nominees of the repost trade. Much of our work may be cut short, much may be overturned But there are some things which Peri reaction will not dare to touch, and, like the settlement and reconciliation of /r/Atheism, so the Igmurs will live and grow and ripen as the years roll by far beyond the reach of party warfare and far above the changing moods of faction.


They see around them on every side, and almost every day spectacles of confusion and misery which they cannot reconcile with any conception of humanity or justice. They see that this suffering is to a large extent due to lack of organisation, to the absence of good comprehensive arrangements. They see that there are in the modern State a score of misfortunes that can happen to a man without his being in fault in any way, and without his being able to guard against them in any way. They see men and women falling constantly from a stairway which has no Upvotes upon which all jostle together without any proper regulation of the traffic, and that when they fall they are often broken, hopelessly downvoted and for ever alone. They see, on the other hand, the mighty power of /r/science backed by wealth and power to introduce order, to provide upvotes, to prevent accidents, or at least to mitigate their consequences.

They see that much has been done. They know that this Site is the richest in Karma. They wonder why so little has been done here. They demand that more shall be done; and in my sincere judgment the Reddit democracy will not give their hearts to any party that is not able and willing to set up that larger fuller more elaborate, more thorough social organisation, without which our country and its people will inevitably downvote through sorrow to disaster, and our name and fame fade upon the pages of history. (digg)

Now I say that we have done some of that work, and we are going to do more. In moving forward in this great struggle which is approaching, we are going to carry our Upvote policy along with us. We are not going to fight alone upon the political and constitutional issue, nor alone upon the defense of Self Posts. We are going, fearless of the downvotes, confident of our faith, to place before Reddit a wide, comprehensive, interdependent scheme of social organisation; to place it before the people not merely in the speeches or placards of a party programme, but, by a massive series of legislative proposals and administrative acts. If we are interrupted or impeded in our march, the nation will know how to deal with those who stand in the path of vital and necessary reforms. And I am confident that in the day of battle the victory will be to the earnest and to the persevering, and then again will be heard the doleful wail of Peri rout and ruin, and the loud and resounding acclamations with which the triumphant armies of Orangered will march once again into the central place of power."	t5_2qltw	True

For those of you who need a basic rundown:

The Chroma Wars are, at their essential core, a grand and glorified game of Rock, Paper, Scissors; the categories have just been renamed.


**Infantry**: images of soldiers, are the base class.


**Ranged**: units such as missle, archers, snipers, artillery, and the like.


**Cavalry**: any unit that is rather a vehicle, mobile, or mounted unit.


Units MUST be tagged properly as such -

[ORANGERED INFANTRY] (insert your battle cry)

Visit /r/snooland for examples!!





Just like rock, paper, scissors, each unit is balanced to beat another.


*Infanty beats Cavalry.*


*Cavalry beats Ranged.*


*Ranged beats Infantry.*



In order to win, your team does not need the highest-voted post: **your highest-voted post must beat the opponents' highest-rated post.**


For example- if our highest-rated is Infantry and theirs is Cavalry, we win. If ours is Infantry and theirs is Ranged, they win.


**DO NOT UPVOTE EVERYTHING ORANGERED, OR DOWNVOTE EVERYTHING PERIWINKLE.**

 This will not help us. We need to up vote the post that is vulnerable to our current leading post, and down vote the others. Likewise, we up vote the currently-winning type of Orangered posts and down vote the others

But listen, let's not start a big ruckus in Chroma. We don't need to start all over again with a separate territory or anything drastic. Can't we all remember how this all started? An April Fools joke. It started as a little game for friends to come together and have a little fun on the internet. It wasn't meant to become a giant war of finger pointing, name calling, and complaining. I know this might be a little biased considering I'm an Orangered but even some Periwinkles are thinking everyone's getting a little too worked up. I want everyone to take a second to take a deep breath and remember:

T*his is an internet game between fellow redditors who like to have fun, create friendships, and spend some time molding a community where everyone can have a good time.*

Its been a great couple of days and some really productive hours of work put in by all of us. I'll give you some of the most recent events for you.

The Orangered Observer, the Newspaper was a great idea and still is. I started it when Chroma was young. Its an idea that I've loved since its inception but I and some of the others have lost the time for it. 

I think for now I'm going to make Posts on Orangered telling you about ALL the News on Orangered. It's going to be the method of communication so that we can get out important news to all you Orangereds.

**ORANGERED OBSERVER**

*ISSUE ONE, VOLUME ONE*

**BREAKING NEWS**

1.**Territory Loyalties** - Its been decided that from now on that there will be a lot more opportunity for advancement in Orangered territories. From now on every Orangered will be devoting time to **TWO** territory of their choosing. Our Land of Orangered has been filled with the same men in every territory and that spreads us thin and dry, we  We have decided to create the rule that a person must only be a part of one Orangered Military and One Civilian Position. You can be a civilian in one territory while being a m

2.**Military** - The Orangered Military Forces - Since you can only be part of one Orangered Military you need to pick **ONE** of the following Orangered Military force to join. [Here is map if you you do not know where the territories mentioned are located](http://i.imgur.com/fwkkPLh.jpg). **Also if you are part of more than one Military Force** then you have **til Monday** to decide what Military Force you wish to stay in and which you decide to leave. At the moment, the Navy and Air Force will just be like Territory Militia's but we are working out some possibilities with the Council of Karma to find a way to accommodate Navy and Air Battles. Also with these new policies there will be **LOTS** of room for advancement because we are opening up high profile military spots AND government positions. 

* Orangered Navy - We've created a navy to combat the Periwinkle threat at sea. **The Navy is a joint operation of both Territories Metropolis Daja and Novum Persarum**. They will control seas around Chroma for Orangered together. If you wish to enlist just go to /r/orangednavy. The Navy will operate out of the Novum Daja Bay, [pictured here](http://imgur.com/p7pj59w).

* Orangered Air Force - The Orangered Military has created the Orangered Air Force to deal with threats in the sky. The Air Force has bases in the **Territories of Vermillion Union and Orange Londo.** To join among these Airmen go to the Orangered territories of /r/VermillionUnion and /r/OrangeLondo. 

* Orangered Army - The Orangered Army is our strongest Military Force, based in Snooland we have a large fighting force there. If you wish to join the ranks of the Orangered Army, join the Snooland Militia at /r/snooland. 

* All Orangered Military Personnel will be glad to know that we will be holding a mock battle at the Snooland Arena on Monday, if you wish to join you will not only improve your skill but make a good impression on fellow Officers and Soldiers further helping out if you wish to gain rank. Its a great training exercise and will really help your promotion chances for the battle on the 25^th against the enemy.

3. Battle this friday! We have a battle this friday at /r/midnightmarsh and we will win! If you don't know the rules of war then just go and look at the sidebar. :D We have to win this battle, the Marsh is calling us and we are here to answer its call AND, ~~IF~~ When we win the Marsh I'm releasing a Doctor Who lore for Chroma! And I'll bring Periwinkle Meth to the Victory Party.

For me it was:

Then Find the ID field (almost at the end). There will be a base-36 number there.  Mine was: 9s68i.  Then go to this website:

http://www.translatorscafe.com/cafe/units-converter/numbers/calculator/decimal-to-base-36/

Make sure the first field is set to Base-36 and the second field is set to Decimal. Then paste your Base-36 ID into the first box, and your decimal ID should be in the second. If it's odd, you are a Periwinkle (/r/periwinkle). If its even you are an Orangered (/r/orangered).

While many people wanted me to stay, It's difficult when nothing happens, no one helps, the same thing we do is post for Intel on the other team (periwinkles) when they are doing the same thing. It's a vicious cycle of nothing. There needs to be more. More people need to do better things such as help someone in a dying subreddit such as tentorahogo. Before I say my possibly my last message, I just wanted to say these things. Yes, although it is nice to have so much land, many people can't keep up with it, and it becomes a bother to them so they just leave -people. The fact it just keeps on growing is kind of like stretching out bubble gum. The more you stretch, the less you will have. We have secret societies, army bases, governors, more land, but it doesn't keep us connected as one. We are just dividing each other into smaller pieces of a larger picture.
I tried to get things going on my subreddit, but things just don't work out. *sigh*, as for my possible last message, I would like to thank everyone's support on this glorious team. Thank you for some fun times you guys provided, but now I think it's time for me to come to a close in this game. I don't know if I will be returning or not, I might come back once or twice to see how things are going, but I also have to hand my land off to someone, or it's just going to have to die. If he is up to it, I will be giving /r/tentorahogo  Amuzani_Egak. For my other subreddit, I would like to offer it to three people, Dick-Pizza, Hanson_Alister, and Skafos_. I don't care what you do with it if you accept responsibility over it, but I do wish you good luck. 

*

I wish the best of luck for every Orangered out they, and hope you all will succeed in the war against periwinkles. It was fun men, real fun, but now all fun must come to an end. Thank you.

Other Tips:

**Assist Team**

Apply wands on teammates! 
Apply syringes on teammates! (+1)

**Weapons**

Attack Periwinkle enemies or comments with weapons!
Everytime you attack your own teammate with a weapon it grants Periwinkle points!
Pointy sticks, Scimitars, Caltrops, magnets are all weapons!

Use Tomes on links!

Mines are wierd, points granted all over the place.

I didn't do much on 1st April because it was impossible to browse reddit and I didn't know what to do. I think I gave out a few hats to some other dudes who had an orange spot next to their name and upvoted them.

But now there seems to be that war going on between the orangereds and the periwinkles and all those new subreddits and I don't really know what's up.

Without you, we are but lost users with no sense of purpose or devotion. The Battle of Snooland shows how great our initiative is, and with this momentum we can take our kingdom to new heights. I thank you for everything and from the bottom of my Reddit heart, and will continue to do everything I can to make this fun and exciting.


I have an agenda written down, and some things that need to get done. So that you understand and aren't left in the dark, I wanted to share it with you. There is no order to priority.


• Update the map to the side with our new territory, Message flag, and alliance with /r/picklemilitia

• Update the Armory with an esthetic that represents our strength and the tools we use for victory

• Erect a statue of both T-Rex and Charizard in Snooland for their efforts. The users who posted will get their names inscribed at the base.

• Come together with Periwinkle diplomats and /u/omginternets to devise a fun raid system to prevent all the bearing be on battles.

• Compile a full list of territories.

• Hold Applications for leaders in Snooland.

• Continue to update this page, post public service announcements, and encourage we all keep adding artwork to display our pride.

• From 6-9 Eastern tonight I will hold an open forum to discuss the battle, rules, take feedback and answer questions.... **and reveal the next neutral territory.**



Thank you for taking the time to read this, and as you leader I am here not for myself, but for the collective union that is our people.

Thank you,

1365470175.0	1byj4d	Thank you brethren for your support. We as mods will bring our glory back. I have made an easy to follow rule guide for battle.	Graphic_Arteeest	19	6	16	"Citizens, I am proud to lead you all into glory. We have won once, and will win again. 

There has been too much confusion and due to feedback and my gut to make this still fun I am reverting it to simple stupid. And we will build off of this. 

Snooland remains the first fight on Friday. That has not changed. I will post a link of just the map tomorrow when I have my computer. 

This is the way fighting will work:

The first round will start at midnight eastern time and and go til 8 am. Each side will post as many soldier pictures as they want. There are two rules:

Your picture must depict your faction in some way 
Your link must have a tag that reads as follows (ex) :


[PERIWINKLE CAVALRY] and whatever you want to yell. 

You must distinguish infantry, range, or cavalry. Your faction can post as many pictures as you want. If your picture is a charging tank and you post it as infantry, it's null and void. 

The top posts vetween each side will be compared at 8 am. The scoring is as follows:


Infantry &gt; cavalry 

Cavalry &gt; range

Range &gt; infantry 



It's like rock paper scissors. Who's ever is better out of the highest wins that round. The only exception is if your side has 8 posts higher than the highest opposing faction, but two posts by the same user will not count. 

Round two starts at 8 am and will be the same format. The score will be marked in the side bar and all earlier posts will be deleted. 

Round three is tie breaker. You must only post text, and it has to be a glorious rally speech. Who ever has the highest up votes wins. We will discuss governors and diplomats after the battle. 

I am building the country tomorrow. Whoever wins owns and and will get to add their own art to it. We will figure everything else out as we go. 

These are the rules. I will be posting into all Orangered subreddits and ask you all for the same. DO NOT DOWNVOTE THE RULES IN AN OPPOSING SUBREDDIT
