Browneye and I have been talking and we were thinking of giving this place a little make-over: change up the logo and banner, and possibly the upvote and downvote buttons. 

But of course, we don't just want to do it straight away, without asking your opinions on it all. 

Do you guys have any ideas of what we could change the logo to? Or should we keep it? Do you think the upvote/downvote buttons are fine, or would you like something which looks a bit better?

Self-post, so please upvote so people can see :)

*I'll keep this post updated with changes I make*

~ Do give feedback ~

*EDIT: Upvote this if you want us to do a makeover :P*

*EDIT 2: I changed up the header/banner thing. I took Snoo (The Reddit Alien) and photoshopped a guitar onto him and then drew in some arms. I also made the banner less thick.*

*EDIT 3: I replaced the tartan with a sunset over some sunflower crop, I don't if you guys like it, I can always change it, if you have a better idea in mind, do just comment with it, this is just something temporary. I got rid of the red/black theme, it was distracting :P*

**EDIT 4: Updated the Upvote and Downvote buttons, I'm still not sure about them, what do you think? Larger? Do you want wants which have something to do with IndieFolk, or do like these?**"	t5_2srge	True

1352343275.0	12u4jh	Favorite Albums of 2012?	erratically_sporadic	37	6	68	"I know theres still 2 months left, but from what I've seen coming out in the next 2 months, nothing that can break my top 10 list for 2012. What have been your favorite indie folk albums of 2012? Also what do you think is the most underrated band/album of 2012?

Mine faves of this year are:

**Grizzly Bear - Shields** :While it may not technically be indie folk, nothing can really come close. Its beyond amazing for me. [Yet again](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuG9i5cwGW0) and [Gun-shy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHtgvPYKo3o) give me the shivers.

**Dirty Projectors - Swing Lo Magellan** :Also one of my faves from 2012. Very nice follow up from Bitte Orca. [Gun has no trigger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_qFaFl7JVc) and [Unto Caesar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wt-eVWuz9Mw) are my favs.

**The Mountain Goats - Transcendental Youth** :I don't know how they do it, but TMG always seem to impress. Similar in sound to last years (i think), but still another favorite. [Harlem Roulette](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzv7oiKqOvU) and [Night Light](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIr82azRFqM) remind me why TMG are one of my all time favorite bands.

**Shearwater - Animal Joy** :Jesus. I knew this would be near the top of my list when it came out. Darker, deeper and heavier than most indie folk, but overall amazing. All of it is so good, but [Breaking the Yearlings](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-zjzfS-YvE) and [Pushing the River](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2-U0UX0wY) are so so good.

**Horse Feathers - Cynics New Year**: I believe this was one of the most surprising and perhaps most underrated albums of 2012. Everytime I listen to it I find more things to appreciate about it. The strings on this album are probably my favorite part. Pacific Bray and [Fit Against the Country](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Haynrr8Hw) and excellent.

**Lumineers - S/T**:Simple, catchy, excellent. It was released early in the year and is still very popular. Lots of radio stations are determined to make me hate the singles due to overplay. [Dead Sea](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkH-lRErMo) and [Big Parade](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-RWyVinU) are must listens.

**Husky - Forever So**:Another surprise. Very moody and catchy. I saw them (and met them!) right before they got some media attention, so they are definitely on my list. Of course you need to hear [History's Door](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlWph8X18sc) and [Dark Sea](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gey_wfeaHYU).

**Band of Horses - Mirage Rock**:Probably the biggest surprise on my list. ""Biggest surprise?"" you ask. Yep I didn't anticipate the new BoH to be on my list but with songs such as [Dumpster World](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_mhcLmZAYw) and [Heartbreak on the 101](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKWY1BpMTEE), it edged out The Avett Brothers and Shins.

What about you guys? Here is my overall list (all genres) [if you're curious.]

**The Plan:**
We (/r/IndieFolk) will collaboratively create a playlist throughout the month, and at the end of the month it will be released for download. You can post your suggestions with a link (YouTube, Spotify or whatever) in the comments section and others will vote on them. We can choose the top 30, 20 or 50 (up for you guys to decide) tracks and then I will make them available for download.

* No RIAA Labels. [Wikipedia List](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_RIAA_member_labels)
* Freely available or self released tracks welcome
* Buy it if you like it, support indie artists

My hope is that this will encourage music discovery and promote indie artists, and we can create a hand picked selection of tracks chosen by the community every month for everyone to enjoy.

Anyway, here's a link to a free download of the album. I think the 200 freebies should be enough, but if they aren't let me know and we will definitely make something happen. 

http://thewhiskeyriverkings.bandcamp.com/

Obviously you don't have to, but if you find yourself enjoying the music it would be amazing if you would like us on facebook- those numbers really do help, even if it's just with band morale- we went back in studio to cut the first track off of the new record yesterday so we're all sort of excited right now. http://www.facebook.com/WhiskeyRiverKings

(P.S- if you just want the folky tracks you might want to give 3, 6, and 9 a miss and, as always, I would LOVE to hear any thoughts you have about the music, especially about what you might like to hear to make it better!)"	t5_2srge	True

1335590225.0	swgi5	Four months into 2012: Whats on your list of top albums/artists? CONVO THREAD - PLEASE CONTRIBUTE	erratically_sporadic	26	2	31	"I see a lot of youtube links to songs but not a lot of conversation about music. What albums are you digging lately?

I've been listening to Andrew Bird's new album a lot but I'm not a fan of the 'ambient' noise songs, like Belles for instance.

I haven't like Delta Spirit much in the past, but their new (self titled) album is likely to top my favorite albums list for 2012.

M. Wards new one is interesting but not as enjoyable as his past albums for me. I love M. Ward and I love Zooey Deschanel but for some reason I don't like them together. I don't know why.

2 other favorites of mine are Shearwater's Animal Joy and The Shin's Port of Morrow. Shearwater made an excellent somber album and I feel they are one of the most under rated bands.

I was skeptical that James Mercer would be able to pull off another classic album with a completely replaced band but it is much more enjoyable than I had anticipated.

Also, its good to have a bunch of newbies to the genre. Of Monsters and Men has a new album but Little Talks is still their best song (and super popular right now) imo. Lots of potential in the future.

Good Old War is great and I had the great fortune of seeing them live. Although its not my favorite style of music, its really good ""chill out"" album.

Someone (I think from this subreddit, not quite sure) sent me a few tracks from Dry The River. I haven't heard of them before and I haven't listened to them much but I really dig it so far.

Welp, that's my opinion. I'd love to hear yours! Did I miss some standout bands? What did you think of the musicians I've mentioned?"	t5_2srge	True

I don't see much discussion either (and I am definately one of the guilty lurkers) but I just want to say thanks and how greatful I am for the consistently quality links people are posting up on here. My ipod is now flooded with much better music then it was a few months ago before I found this subreddit. 

Very few of the songs i've listened to that were posted on here were not then added to my favourites. You guys have made grinding through hours of mindless rotoscoping and 3D modelling so much more bearable and dare I say fun now!

I'm Alec, and I'm a local radio DJ for [A Fistful Of Vinyl on 88.9 FM Los Angeles &amp; www.kxlu.com](http://www.facebook.com/a.fistful.of.vinyl).     I have an extra pair of tickets to give away to go see Josh Ritter tomorrow night, and you guys have always been really cool to me, so I wanted to give you first dibs.


Put your favorite Josh Ritter lyric on the wall of our [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/a.fistful.of.vinyl), and I'll pick one around midnight and let you know that you won tickets. You don't even have to listen to my show (though if you did, that'd be alright.)
