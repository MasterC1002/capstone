Woke up this morning and watched five Whitetails feed in the field below the house. Got the kids up and going and off to school and as we were driving into town I noticed a Whitetail stuck in the fence on the public hunting grounds. At first it appeared to be dead but as we passed by she flopped up and down pretty good.

So, turn around, pull down into the ditch near the fence and look things over. Her left rear leg had caught the top barb wire portion of the fence and twisted with the next link down. 

My two sons, 11 and 8, were pretty excited and wanted to know what to do. So I told them I would free her and see if she can move off on her own. They were to stay in the SUV no matter what happened. My 11 year old had shot a Buck in 2012 and has hunted so at first he had a confused look on his face. I started to remind him of the ethics and morals he was taught for hunting. He was trying to make the leap now on why we help a animal we hunt.

I called the County dispatch in case she was to far gone. I could have easily put her down myself since I did have the means with me to shoot and kill her but the law is the law and without a tag and this close to the road I'd be in deep shit if I did so.

County told me they would send someone out and to call back if I freed her. I worked about 10 minutes twisting the top part enough that her leg would free. I made sure to stay on the other side of the fence so she couldn't kick me. Once it did she laid there for a second, I hollered at her and she jumped up and limped off...slowly...but at least now she has a fighting chance against the 'yotes in the area.

Called the County dispatch back and told them all was well. Then bumped into both local Counties when I dropped the boys off at their schools. Both got the call but were on school patrol for the morning drop off and both know me, heard the name and were laughing when the kids got out of the truck and started telling them the tale. Both counties at both schools said the same thing. ""you handled it as we would hope someone would""

Oddest thing about it, when we left the house to go to school we saw a County Cop, F250 Super duty, he was coming out of the parking lot for the nude beach area. No idea how he didn't see the Doe, I know he passed her because I usually meet this County every morning driving to town.

I'm not karma whoring or looking for upvotes I just wanted to pass the story along somewhere. I'm more than happy to have people tell their tales in here also. Also give pointers on discussing it with kids. I think I explained it well enough, again, to the boys so they understand why we are not just Hunters but the poster child of our sport and need to do the right thing all the time.

Tim gets this horrified look on his face.

&gt;You shot that Coyote/Bobcat/Prairie Dog etc how did it taste, my daddy said only kill what you eat. 

Please don't take that so literal. I get it, you don't want things going to waste, but these animals are taken to prevent waste.  Not all hunting is for food, lots of hunting is for population management, and to deal with predators.  Predators that kill livestock which is not good for farmers. Sometimes population management is a win win because it provides more food. Oklahoma was asking hunters to take a couple extra doe last year, just for that reason. 

If you're not from an area where hogs are destroying land, and multiplying by the millions maybe you should read up on it, before you issue such strong opinions on how many a hunting takes at once. 

&gt;You hunt a feeder, that's not hunting

&gt;You walk down a trial in an orange suit and wait for something to cross your path, that's not hunting. 

&gt;You hunt high fence, that's not hunting. 

&gt;You hunt from a stand, not hunting, 

&gt; You hunt like this it's not hunting. 

Give it a rest, you're way of hunting may be the way you prefer, you may feel it's harder, you may feel you give the animal more ""fair chase""   That's FINE, keep it to your self.  Not everyone has the chance to hunt like you do, many places don't have natural food plots.   Many people start out hunting with a guide because they don't know where or how to hunt, so they need HELP not your smart alec comments. If someone is  taking the game quickly and humanly, then leave them alone. 

You hunt with a bow, that's awesome, you're awesome. Keep being awesome, I'll keep hunting with my rifle.  Not because I think their is anything wrong with hunting with a bow, it's just another hobby I don't need.

I moved to a new site. We had orange hats when we moved in to the spot and I did a quick check of the immediate area for safety. I Sit down and start calling. A massive Tom gets within view but not in shot. Tom gobbles back and we are calling him in. The Tom is about 30 yards away on the other side of some brush and quickly closing. All of a sudden a gun shot roars and pellets blast into the hillside I am sitting on. Some random dude stands up about 50 yards from me in direct line of sight runs over to the bird, grabs it. I yelled and he hauls ass out of the woods.

 My father and I are not injured but it was fucking close. The guy had to of seen us come in and set up our decoys as well as me scouting the area for safety. He also had to of known he was poaching. he took off like a bat out of hell when I yelled. And had this asshole injured me he would have left me there. 

 We are having the incident followed by police. Still a bit shaken up. 
 
Edit: State Police are investigating. One of the hunting club members was on duty (trooper) at the time. Lets see where this ends up. Will post if I find out more.

(not that I think you'd neglect to do either)	checkyotraps	67	3	25	"Just got back from a three A.M. adventure in single digit temps to track down the obviously suffering hound dog I could hear from my property. 

Went and checked my neighbor's field adjacent to our back forty first because I know they trap and my dog was once caught in one of theirs; but the mournful baying I heard once I was back there let me know that the dog was at least another 80 acres away on another property.

I hit the gravel road and was able to drive right up on said gravel to where I'd heard him and tracked the whimpering to behind a cedar tree just beyond the barbwire. 

I hopped the fence and there he was, wagging his tail to see someone and straining against a smooth metal foot trap. I gave him some pupperoni and put my coat over him, then got his collar off and called the number I found on it. The owner said he'd be right over. The dog seemed pretty friendly so I went ahead and risked freeing his foot. He whined a bit but didn't snap at me or anything. About fifteen minutes later the owner (pissed off father of the owner, actually) and dog were headed home and I rushed home all adrenalined out to tell the story on /r/hunting. 

Here's the thing. If I hadn't heard someone calling for their dog in the afternoon I doubt I would have concluded that the dog was in a trap. Someone went home without their dog and someone else neglected to check their traps in the evening and a very good dog had to sit trapped in single digit temps for at least twelve hours until I happened to go take a leak in the front yard. 

Who knows how long he'd have been there if I hadn't checked it out. I recognized the name on the trap and really doubt he'd have gone out to check his traps in the morning. I certainly never see him out my way and I tend to be out and all over the place by daylight. 

I just can't believe someone would go home during daylight without having found their dog. Kinda makes me sad."	t5_2qlkx	True

Yesterday,I gave him a big tasty backstrap!	dieselgeek	61	7	8	"He's been in the US for 5 years and his ears perked up when I told him that I hunt deer.  The way he explains it, they can't hunt as they don't have a ton of wild life to begin with.  He is of Hindu faith, but explained that they have steak restaurants and other westernized culture in his home town. 

Anyway, I looked in the freezer, and I had one vacuum sealed big thick back strap left.  I brought it in for him and he was very excited. He ran home from work real quick and dropped it off with his wife to start cooking for that evenings dinner. 

He came in today, said he liked it very much and thanked me. I just thought this is something I'd share w/ this sub. It was a good feeling to share something with someone that was forbidden from eating it and hunting it ( 10 year max prison term)  in his home land.  I like that it was something I harvested my self vs just taking him to a place that has Venison. 


    His wife cooked it like Lamb Fry, and gave me this link for the recipe.

I'm just curious why picture after picture after picture is being posted to this sub without any real background or information, or even a statement indicating that these are from your hunts, versus something you found online. A few of the comments hint that you were there, but it feels like you're just posting stuff from Google. 

Just looking for some clarity, that's all. If they're yours, I'd like to hear some background stories on them, as you must get some great hunting opps if these really are you.

I was doing some winter squirrel hunting today, with no luck. I was really just doing it to get out in the woods. As I was heading back, I see the sillhoutte of a small red squirrel dash across the snow into a hollow tree. It was kind of far away, too far to get a good look at and certainly too far for my 20 gauge, so I moved closer. I leaned against a tree and trained my bead on the opening. About 15 minutes a little copper-brown head pops out, and I fired.

The animal was dead in an instant. It rolls out of the tree and that's when I see the stripes. It wasn't a red squirrel. It was a chipmunk.

I know there are worse animals to kill by mistake, but I still feel pretty guilty and foolish for my mistake. I just needed to get it off of my chest."	t5_2qlkx	True

For her first time out hunting we sat in a double ladder stand we had put up together this summer.  We hadn't been sitting in that stand 10 minutes when these 2 came crashing through the woods.  They stopped 30 yards at most in front of us and were fighting to the death!  I have never seen deer in the wild fighting, let alone right in front of me.  I shot the bigger one through the heart and it died instantly and fell to the ground.  The other (smaller) deer kept fighting the dead one.  It was tossing the dead deer around pretty severely.  After 15 seconds of being stunned I told my wife to get her rifle up and kill the other one.  She did and it died right there.  It is no question the coolest thing that has ever happened to me in the woods and I will never forget it.  Both bucks had really bloody heads and faces.  The one had its ear cut pretty deep.  Awesome day in the woods.

The only problem is that my wife is never going to believe me when I come home skunked.  She is going to expect this everytime!  Just as a side note I am usually a bow hunter but on this one I used a .270 and she had a .243.  "	t5_2qlkx	True
