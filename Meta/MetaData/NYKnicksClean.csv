I think they're quite exciting to watch, and for some reason I took a liking to them from when I watched my first game.

So I guess I'm a Knicks fan...

Does someone want to give me a brief overview of the team, or is there a website I can read?

1372683429.0	1hf90p	Help me understand why the Bargnani trade is terrible.	nicejerk	47	3	59	"After reading tweets, posts on reddit, and posts on forums, it appears Knicks fans are unanimously against this trade.  I just don't get it. How could anyone see this as a terrible deal?

Here's what we know:

**Bargnani is owed $23m over the next two years**
Sure, that doesn't look pretty, but considering we shipped away nearly $20 million in salary between Novak and Camby, the money argument shouldn't be an issue. We broke even and got back a MUCH better player than who we gave up.

**It's still a terrible contract**
Sure, but we're so over the cap that it doesn't matter.  His deal is over in 2 years. By then, the Knicks will have zero guaranteed contracts (Felton has a player option, Shumpert has a qualifying offer, not sure of Hardaway's rookie deal). In fact, Novak was the only guaranteed contact in 2015, and we got rid of it.

**Bargnani has proven to be a 20 ppg score**
Whether it's the Raptors or a D-league team, Camby and Novak will never be able to match Bargnani as scorers.  Will Bargnani average 20+ on the Knicks. No. But, knowing that Bargnani has proven to have the ability to put up points, it will help this team more than what the combination of Novak and Camby would've been able to.

**We gave up a 1st round pick in 2016**
While anything can happen in 2016, As mentioned above, we have a clean slate in 2015. We can bring back Carmelo and bring in 2 additional star free agents, similar to what the Heat did a few years back. If so, we're talking about losing a 20+ draft pick and a 2nd rounder. Whoever that player is in 2016, I find it very difficult to believe that that player will have more potential than Bargnani today. If the Knicks are a lottery team by 2016, then sure, this deal will come back to haunt them. But, I just don't see that happening considering we may have the most salary cap flexibility this team has ever seen. And, as we've learned, it won't be difficult to lure star athletes to NYC.

**Novak and Camby have zero value**
If we had a player who averaged 8.4 points, 5.2 rebounds and 1 assist per game, we wouldn't care much for him. Those are the numbers that Novak and Camby posted COMBINED. These two players were dead weight with zero value who we were on the hook to pay $20 million over the next 2 1/2 years. Somehow, we managed to get a player in return who has has proven to have enough talent to be a starting NBA player.

**Bargnani doesn't play defense**
If Woody managed to get Melo and the crew to play defense, then anything is possible.

All of these arguments don't convince me that this deal is as terrible as some fans make it seem. I don't think it's a steal for either team. The Raptors wanted to get rid of Bargnani; the Knicks wanted to get rid of Camby and Novak. They both got what they wanted.

However, if we consider the following arguments, then I can understand why so many people are seeing this deal as a joke for the Knicks.

**Are the Knicks receiving a player better than Garnett and Pierce?**

**Is the player's name Rondo? If not, then I hate the deal.**

**Did we get an all star in return for nothing, not even a late 1st round pick?**

**Can we start the season tomorrow with this squad?**

... I'm sure there are a few other arguments we can add to this list. I need help understanding why so many people hate this deal. I just don't see it."	t5_2rur5	True

He worked on this corner three during his recovery from the ACL tear and this season he shot 10% better from downtown. I think at one point he actually passed Novak in 3pt percentage. He's quickly becoming a reliable offensive option who can also play lockdown D, much like Kawhi Leonard or Jeff Green. If he continues to up his game he can really be huge for the franchise in the long hall. If only Woodson can learn to give him more minutes and not sit him when the team needs him on the court. At times during these playoffs it seemed like he's the only player in a Knick Jersey playing with heart out there.	t5_2rur5	True

Everyone complains about Melo's isolation plays, but the fact is that when he isn't being doubled on the catch, a Melo iso is one of the most devastating plays in the NBA (PERIOD).

He isn't LeBron, he isn't Durant...but you know what?  **They aren't Melo either!**

They have taken their defensive playstyle from the [master](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DOUyxvp9bI) of all [flopping](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ukde193ivM) team, the [San Antonio Spurs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxHOJGc-vxw). What's worse, players gets fouls, destroys any hot streak, and the rewards faaaar outweighs any negative criticisms Jeff Van Gundy might say about their flop.

It's time we, the fans, stand up to these crap. Let's video every flop, be it the refs making the call or not, and spread it on all social media available and get the league office's attention that we, the fans, are sick of it.

It's time Dwayne Wade to take a jumper and don't fall on his ass.

Honestly, we're up 3-2 in the series. It's still a 1 win situation for us. We are still the team that can wrap things up with 1 game. Luckily, the game is tomorrow, and we don't have to sit on these vibes for multiple days.

Our team is very good, but also very streaky in terms of confidence. This game is different though. Now, the C's have all the confidence, the same confidence that led us to lose the last 2, and we have the feeling of desperation. I really do feel that this next game will be the closer. Watching the post-game interviews, it seems like they understand why they've been playing sub-par. It's not our defense, it's the offense. Woody is gonna have a field day with them at practice today, and I really do think they'll get it drilled in their heads that they have to move the ball and create good shots to win games.

So, let's not get any more down about the game yesterday, let's build our confidence back up. Remember, WE ARE UP 3-2."	t5_2rur5	True

1. The refs were pretty terrible all around. As Clyde mentioned in the telecast, ""The refs let this game get sloppy"". They should have called double techs on Chandler and Kardashian during that one sequence to set the tone.

2. The perimeter defense was pretty sloppy. The Nets, albeit a pretty good 3 point shooting team ([11th in 3P%, 2nd in 3PM](http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/team/_/stat/offense-per-game/sort/threePointFieldGoalPct)), should not have gone 15/31 from beyond the arc. Lin was having trouble all night getting around off-ball screens for Deron. They tended to collapse towards the middle and get out of position thus leaving capable shooters open for 3.  Shumpert is an excellent perimeter defender who we will need when facing elite PGs who can create their own shot like Deron. Lin, for all his strengths, is still lacking defensively; especially coming off screens (off-ball and on-ball).

3. I know it's the product of the defensive system, but I think the Knicks are too quick to switch matchups on defense. When Deron ran a pick-and-roll with around 3:20 remaining in the 4th QRT, Chandler was isolated 1 on 1 with Williams. A hot shooting Deron Williams will get his shot off, and likely in, 9 times out of 10. I think Woodson should take a page from our opponents playbook and hedge hard on screen and rolls when playing an elite PG. Hopefully the perimeter D was more of an anomaly. 

4. Amar'e has to step it up all around. His patented 15-18 ft jump shot was consistently long all night. For the year, his jump shot, which accounts for 65% of his total shots, has only gone in at [34.1%](http://www.82games.com/1112/11NYK12.HTM) for the year. Last year, his jump shot percentage was pure [44%](http://www.82games.com/1011/10NYK19.HTM) of the time. Not to mention, I think Amar'e must the worst hands in the NBA. He's awkward whenever he dribbles (which usually consists of recklessly driving to the basket with his head down) he often bobbles passes, and gets ""would be"" rebounds snatched every now and then. I have faith in my boy though.

5. Carmelo was really put in a tough spot for tonight. He knew going into this game that the team was playing tremendous without him. That being said, he still needed to show us that he can not only play but play within the system. Early on in the 1st QTR, it looked like he had found that balance. I was giddy after he ran the pick-and-pop with Lin and promptly sunk a Melo™ mid range jumper. I was perhaps even happier when Melo had a decent look from distance on a kickout only to defer to Stat underneath the basket for the easy AND-1. As the game progressed, the offense lost its flow and Melo seemed forgotten. Personally, I think the Knicks still need to get him the ball on the wing for isolation plays. I think I saw 2 maybe 3 instances where Melo initiated an isolation play. Let's not forget that he is an incredible isolation player that can get to the line (not with tonight's officiating crew) at ease.

Let's hope they ""work out the kinks"" so to speak. They have a gauntlet of a schedule coming up"	t5_2rur5	True

1367862349.0	1dsys2	How does this sub feel about the lone writer who voted for Carmelo Anthony as the MVP	macdoogles	36	6	35	"There's [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ds1td/i_voted_carmelo_anthony_for_mvp_gary_washburn/) post on the frontpage of /r/nba. Gary Washburn was the only one who didn't vote for Lebron James and instead voted for Carmelo Anthony. Below is his argument. Do you agree?

&gt; _When I placed my NBA MVP vote a few weeks ago, I knew I would be in the minority. I knew LeBron James was the prohibitive favorite to win his fourth award because he unquestionably is the best player in the game._

&gt; _I voted for Carmelo Anthony based on his importance to the New York Knicks, who, if you haven’t been paying attention the past decade, have failed to be relevant._

&gt; _When the voting was announced Sunday afternoon, I was flabbergasted to learn I was the lone voter among 121 to not give LeBron a first-place vote, truly believing Anthony, Kevin Durant, Chris Paul, and perhaps even Kobe Bryant would snag a first-place vote or two._

&gt; _Firstly, when I submitted my vote in mid-April, I had no idea I would be the only voter to leave LeBron out of first. This isn’t Mrs. Wilson’s class, I don’t walk around asking fellow sportswriters their answers to the US History quiz. I had no idea whom the writers were voting for, so this was no LeBron conspiracy._

&gt; _Secondly, this isn’t the Best Player in the Game award, it’s the Most Valuable Player award, and I think what Anthony accomplished this season was worthy of my vote. He led the Knicks to their first division title in 19 years._

&gt; _That’s a long time ago._

&gt; _Anthony led the league in scoring average and basically carried an old Knicks team to the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference. Amar’e Stoudemire missed most of the season with knee issues, Raymond Felton missed six weeks, and Tyson Chandler dealt with nagging injuries, leaving Anthony, J.R. Smith, and a bunch of lottery picks from the mid-1990s to win 54 games and beat the Miami Heat three times._

&gt; _LeBron can win the MVP award every year. He is that good. And it’s to the point where I put him on a Michael Jordan scale. Jordan won five MVP awards but could have earned 10. In the 1992-93 season, Jordan averaged 32.6 points, 6.7 rebounds, 5.5 assists, and 2.8 steals and shot 49.5 percent from the field._

&gt; _And the MVP award went to Charles Barkley._

&gt; _So my vote had more to do with Anthony and less to do with the dominance of LeBron. If you were to take Anthony off the Knicks, they are a lottery team. James plays with two other All-Stars, the league’s all-time 3-point leader, a defensive stalwart, and a fearless point guard. The Heat are loaded._

&gt; _If LeBron was taken away from the Heat, they still would be a fifth or sixth seed. He is the best player of this generation, a multifaceted superstar with the physical prowess of Adonis, but I chose to reward a player who has lifted his team to new heights._

&gt; _The Knicks were slapped around last season by the Heat in the first round, swept by the Celtics the year before, and the constant has been Anthony. Stoudemire, an All-Star-caliber player when healthy, has been dealing with knee problems the past few years. Chandler is a defensive center, and Jason Kidd, Marcus Camby, and Rasheed Wallace are beyond aging. That leaves the scoring load to Anthony and the mercurial Smith._

&gt; _The perception that I knew the other 120 voters cast their first-place votes for LeBron and that I went against the grain as some kind of statement is inaccurate. I have covered the league for years, watched Jordan lose the 1996-97 MVP to Karl Malone, and understand that for one season, certain players just elevate their games. I thought Anthony was the most valuable player to his team this season, not the best player in the league._

&gt; _And the fact that Anthony is struggling in the playoffs, three weeks after I cast my vote, is a serious case of Wednesday morning quarterbacking. Anthony scored 50 points at Miami April 2 and averaged 36.9 points in April when the Knicks were trying to lock down the Atlantic Division and the No. 2 seed._

&gt; _LeBron had a marvelous season and should be the first player to win seven MVP awards, but this season I felt Anthony meant more to his team. It obviously was not a popular vote but it was my right to vote that way._

&gt; _I definitely understand those who believe LeBron should have won unanimously but it’s no easy task making the Knicks relevant again and I think Anthony deserved my kudos for this season._"	t5_2rur5	True

The Knicks bring a half-dozen players with ties to the Nuggets to Denver tonight. Here’s a look:

Carmelo Anthony: Drafted third in 2003, Anthony turned into a perennial all-star and got Denver into the playoffs seven straight seasons. But he only got out of the first round once — in 2009 — and hurt his Denver legacy by forcing a trade in his eighth season.

Kenyon Martin: Played for Denver from 2004 to 2011 after leaving the Nets, who shipped him in a sign-and-trade as Martin inked a 7-year, $90M deal. He averaged double figures five of those Denver seasons. He left last season for the Clippers when the Nuggets didn’t re-sign him.

Marcus Camby: Played there from 2002 to 2008 after the Knicks traded him in the ill-fated Antonio McDyess deal. Had his best years, with four double-double seasons for points and rebounds.

J.R. Smith: Rarely got along with coach George Karl after the Nuggets traded for him in 2006, but he is the Nuggets’ all-time career-leader in 3-pointers made with 768 in five seasons. He left the Nuggets as a free agent during the lockout to sign in China.

Raymond Felton: Was miserable in Denver after getting shipped in the Anthony trade and got demoted to the bench so Ty Lawson could start. He asked for a trade in the summer of 2011 and got one to Portland. So nondescript was his Nuggets career, Felton had to tell one of his Knicks teammates that, yes, he played there once, too.

James White: Had a solid training camp in 2009, befriended Melo, and was the last cut of preseason. White then signed in Spain."	t5_2rur5	True

I go to IU and have had the chance to see the Knicks play the Pacers 3 times this year (regular season, 2 playoff games). I posted on this sub a week or so ago about how the Pacers beat us by roughly FOURTY earlier this season because we don't match up well against them, pure and simple. Making Woodson the scapegoat is absolutely not the answer, considering Knick players haven't connected with a coach as well as him in quite some time; this team hasn't done shit for over a decade, and while I'm obviously disheartened by our play of late, I recognize that most of what's happening in regards to the Pacers handling us so readily has less to do with our tactics and more to do with the fact that the Pacers' strengths directly expose our greatest weaknesses (defending the three ball &amp; our reliance on threes). It's Woody's job to address that, no question, but he can't go out there and force us to hit open looks and rotate the ball effectively--at the end of the day the coaches can only draw up the plays on the whiteboard and hope that their team has the mental discipline to follow through. Woodson isn't the reason we're in this position, our players not playing the way we did back in November is.

A ton of storylines in this one. The Knicks lead the Eastern Conference and are as good as they've been since Patrick Ewing was in his prime. The Lakers are reeling, sitting just 12th in the Western conference and two full games out of a playoff spot. Mike D'Antoni returns to the Garden with as much pressure as he ever felt last season before he got fired. The Lakers are just 4-8 since he took the job.

But all that said, the Lakers are still a talented team. Not a great team by any stretch, especially without Nash, but Kobe is still at the top of his game, Dwight is still as dominating a force as there is in the game, and Pau is still a top three power forward when he wants to be. On any given night they could explode, and this is as big a stage as any, so you have to believe they'll show up motivated. 

If they don't, D'Antoni will literally be on the hot seat already. I expect the Lakers to show up with a ton of energy because they have so much to lose by failing to do so. Whether it's enough against a very disciplined Knicks team that has yet to lose a home game is a different story entirely.

Whatever happens, I'm really looking forward to this game.

At long last, the Knicks and Nets face off after being postponed by everybody's favorite hurricane. Jason Kidd will sit this one out with back spasms, but other than that there are no injuries to report. Kidd should be a tough guy to be without, and I'd expect Brewer to play about 35 minutes tonight in his absense. 

These teams seem to match up really well, with interesting matchups throughout: Felton vs. Williams, Brewer vs. Johnson, Melo vs. Wallace, Lopez vs. Chandler, and Morrow vs. Smith off the bench. The Knicks don't seem to be favored in many of those, but it's time for them to make a statement and win a tough game on the road on the second night of a back-to-back, something they've done just once in three tries this year.

GAME ON.

(My thoughts)	syedd	23	1	17	"There seems to be some negativity surrounding the old roster of the Knicks, even within our own fanbase, but it seems unwarranted to me. Ok, first lets look at our roster. Age should not be that much of an issue if you consider who is in the rotation/depth and minutes played.

.

1st unit (avging about 30-35 mins) and age: PG: Raymond Felton (28), SG: Shump (22), SF: Melo (28), PF: Stat (29), C: Chandler (30)


.


2nd unit (avg about 15-20 mins): PG: Kidd (38), SG: JR (27), SF: Brewer (27), PF: Novak (29), C: Camby (38)

.


3rd unit (not really in rotation, but will back up older players like Kidd and Camby) if necessary: Pablo (35), Thomas (40), Wallace? (38), James White (29), Shurna? (22), Copeland? (28)

?= not guaranteed contracts, but has chance at roster.

.



Ok, now. We can see that our starters are relatively not that old (mostly in prime years). 3 of our oldest players are not really even in the rotation of as now, but are more of a safety net. Additionally, players like Kidd and Camby were considered valuable assets by teams as recent as this summer, but now that Knicks have got a hold of them  and the knicks got slapped with this old team stigma, there is a lot of negativity. Let us remmember not only that these players were starters this past season for other teams, but will be coming off the bench for us for limited minutes. Are we really saying Kidd and Camby cant still be productive coming off the bench for maybe 15 mins a game? Also, our 2nd unit still involves younger guys (Novak, Brewer, JR). Last point to make; veteran presence is a good thing. I've been following the media/scouts on twitter who watch the training camps and  have been hearing a lot about Kidd/Camby/Rasheed being vocal in practice and helping other guys out (how to get open, where to spot up, defensive strategies) --&gt; all these guys have been exceptional players in the NBA, and even if they dont have the prime physical ability anymore can pass on their wisdom."	t5_2rur5	True

Shumpert has finally gotten his legs back under him yet Woodson plays Kidd in crucial minutes when we need stops. I like Kidd but the guy is 40 years old and he's been getting burned so much by quicker guards. So far in these playoffs whoever Shump has guarded has been put on lockdown. He looks just as good as he did last year and has even been a threat on offense from long range.

Don't even get me started with Copeland not playing much. He's another scorer which can take pressure off JR and Melo. But Woodson just can't see it.

Smith, Iman Shumpert, Jeremy Lin: Who can the Knicks hang on to for next year?		21	0	36	"We all know Melo, STAT, and Chandler are going to be around for the next few years due to their longer contracts. But who out of Mobb Deep are we going to hold on to, and who can we not afford to hold on to?

Novak: No contract with the Knicks past this season.

J.R. Smith: Has a player option for next season.

Iman Shumpert: Will be here next season as per contract.

Jeremy Lin: Contract ends after this season. 


I'd really like to see the Knicks hold on to Lin, which I think they will. I also would really like them to hold on to J.R.. Woodson seems to have a good rapport with him, and I think after an offseason he'll be a threat next year.

Novak: I love him. But can we hold onto him. With his breakout season as being the top 3pt shooter in the league, surely he's going to want to get a $4-6 million contract for next year. Can the Knicks afford to keep him.


I'm just throwing things out there. What do you guys think are some likely scenarios as far as the lineup goes for next season? Here is the salaries/current player's contracts through the next 4 or 5 seasons:

The Knicks will start their usual lineup: Felton, Kidd, Brewer, Anthony, and Chandler. Contrary to speculation, Marcus Camby has been ruled out and will not make his season debut.

The big question now is Nash or Kidd, and I'm predicting Kidd would take a veteran's minimum while Nash would only take a Mid-level Exception. If Miami makes an aggressive push for Nash, we still have Kidd. I'll roll with him in this scenario.

Adding another PG is a must do situation for the Knickerbockers. As Lin is the only true PG left (since Davis is gone for 12 months) adding Kidd would certainly be a smart move. The Mid-level Exception should be used on players like Ray Allen, Brandon Bass, Jason Terry or Carl Landry. Let's say we get Allen, allowing us to fill the SG position with an excellent player in the emergency case that Fields continues being mediocre and Shump suffers a sophomore slump.

Thus, the potential Knicks lineup for the 2012-2013 NBA season could look like this:

**PG: Jeremy Lin / Jason Kidd**

**SG: Ray Allen / Landy Fields / Iman Shumpert**

**SF: Carmelo Anthony / Pick / Steve Novak**

**PF: Amar'e Stoudemire / Jared Jeffries**

**C: Tyson Chandler / Josh Harrellson / Jerome Jordan**

1368977056.0	1emtfk	Can we run a sensible offense next year?	barnun	24	6	19	"I certainly haven't made a deep study of it, but while the Knicks were struggling to score this series I turned on a San Antonio game and watched how they ran things. 

What a difference. EVERYBODY moves!! There are so many screens, so much off-the-ball movement, so much misdirection - they make the defense WORK every second out there. 

The key is that no one is the focal point of the SA system. It's about creating GOOD, OPEN shots. It's basic basketball fundamentals. When you get a defense moving, chasing, scrambling, the entire floor opens up and you will have multiple options every possession. Melo can still get his shots, maybe just a few less, but they can be higher quality looks, making him even more dangerous. 

Even this season, we heard it over and over again. When the Knicks offense was at its best, it was because of good ball movement, but it seemed like as soon as they got in a tight game, all that went out the window. 

I don't know if Woodson can do it. If he's capable of designing a comprehensive offense and then keeping players like Melo and JR (if he's still around) accountable to sound team principles, awesome. If not, I agree with the pitchfork mob on here, he has to go. Problem is, I don't know if any coach can accomplish that as long as Melo refuses to allow things to change and fully commits himself to being a true team player at all times, ESPECIALLY in pressure situations.

1334540992.0	sbogy	What are you taking away from the Miami game?	barnun	20	1	29	"My impressions: 

1. Only 6 players bothered to show up. Essentially, LBJ, Wade and Bosch beat Melo, Smith and Chandler. The fact that Miami has nothing after their Big 3 is their Achilles Heel, along with their lack of size, if an opponent can expose it. NY can and should get more out of their bench and role players than they got today. 

2. Fields is a big key and needs to get his head out of his ass. If he can get more aggressive and knock down even a couple more shots, he makes the offense much more dynamic. How many times did he get the ball in a key moment and either give it up right away, not even being a threat, or brick a shot? He's capable of playing better but right now he's a liability. 

3. This game was frustrating but encouraging. From a depth perspective, with players 4-9 or 10, the Knicks are a better team. Add in Stat, and maybe their size and depth turns this into a win. 

4. I'm excited about coach Woodson's investment in JR Smith. Looks like the support is paying dividends and Smith is quickly developing into a more reliable and complete player.

5. They need to run some plays for Novak. This guy is a tremendous shooter, but can never create his own shot. Right now it looks like they just camp him out on the arc and wait until his man is forced to help off. How about starting him on the baseline, running him off some double screens, and making a point of trying to get him open? even if he can't get free, you force the defense to shift or switch, creating opportunities elsewhere. 

6. Box the fuck out. NY got that memo when it was already too late. If they protect the defensive glass, they win; simple as that. 

Bottom line for me, if this Miami team wins a title, I may give up on NBA ball all together. This is a team sport, and you shouldn't be able to stick 3 players with a bunch of scrubs and win it all. Dallas beating them with depth and solid team play was refreshing, and I pray it happens again, preferably by NY, but otherwise my favorite team is anyone playing the Heat. "	t5_2rur5	True

Potential for 2nd round? ECF? Title?



Lin/Kidd


JR/Shump/James White


Melo/Novak


Stat/Melo/Jeffries (?)


Chandler/Camby




Ok, so we have a talented roster, and we have made some good moves in Kidd and Camby. Old as they may be, they are good pickups; Kidd still can pass as far as I can tell, and we only need him to play about 20-25 minutes as a backup to Lin. Camby is also old as hell but he is still effective; I think his rebounding efficiency was only second to Dwight (if I am not mistaken). We also don't need him to play heavy minutes as he will be backing Chandler. 

Defense has not been as much of an issue as our offense, which is not good considering we have players like Melo/Amare, who are scorers first and foremost. Lin gave us glimpses that he can be an effective PG. Shumps an all around monster already in his rookie year, and Tysons defense is superb. JR smith shoots too many dumbass shots, but he is a good player coming off the bench and is cheap (maybe starting till Shump returns). Novaks a knock down 3 point shooter, but hopefully works on moving off the ball better. Injuries plagued us last year, and hopefully it is not as much of an issue this year.  Hopefully Woodson can mesh this team well enough. Our players are apparently working hard. Carmelo apparently lost 12 pounds and Amare is apparently working hard as well, with a trainer going everywhere with him. 

The talent/potential is clearly there. 2nd round in playoffs is safest bet, but If we work out the kinks, I think we can go far (like challenging for the ECF).  If EVERYTHING goes right (and yea, I am biased as fuck but what do you expect) I can even see us contending for the chip. I know, I know, lets win 2 games first in the playoffs first, but shit I think the Knicks are sending a signal that they are trying to make a run. 

Also, Stephen A Smith mentioned that he thinks Nets are a better team than the Knicks as of RIGHT NOW without Dwight, which had me thinking wtf. With Dwight that is another debate but as of right now, I dont believe that shit, and was wondering where others were at within this debate.

But this whole discussion of Amare and Melo shouldn't be where the focus is.

Amare sucks.  That's right, I said it.  Yes, last year when he was **healthy** and the focal point of our offense, he played like an MVP.  But since he's been injured, he's been absolutely TERRIBLE.  Amare has been whack for over a year and it has more to do with injuries than his actual play.

He can't jump.  He has no legs.  It looks like he gets an inch off the ground.

He can't guard anyone, he's a step slow even when he tries.  And now everytime he touches the ball on offense, he tries WAY too hard and either gets stuffed or turns the ball over.  He doesn't even pass anymore, he just tries to go one-on-one.    

This isn't just the Clippers game, this has been Amare's motif for the entire season.  And I know we want him and Melo to work so badly... but Amare is in no condition to be playing good basketball no matter who he plays with right now.      "	t5_2rur5	True

1332470333.0	r9e8q	Analysis of Amar'e, Lin, and Melo Against 76ers	to_be_quite_frank	20	3	11	"1. **Amar'e Stoudemire**: It seems that whatever lingering back issues  STAT was experiencing from much of the season have subsided. At least for the moment, Amar'e is looking aggressive on both sides of the ball. He admitted earlier this year that his back issues set back his conditioning and pretty much all basketball activities. It showed. His shot, while it's not quite where is was from much of last year, has improved. His defense, although still nowhere near elite, is much better. Best of all, he's getting good position in his face up game and making strong, aggressive moves to the hoop. He assured us this week that he's got his mojo back, ""My rhythm is back, my strength is back and my timing is back. I rehabbed my back the whole lockout, didn't play contact basketball for six months, and that's the most I've ever been away from the game since I was a little kid."" 3 plays that really caught my attention this game were the two standing dunks from under the hoop, and the chase down block on Brand in the 4th quarter. I felt like Amar'e, in the beginning of the year, lost a lot of his athleticism and explosiveness.  These plays assured us that we can't stop counting down the days until Amar'e Stoudemire becomes Amar'e Stoudemire's expiring contract.

2. **Jeremy Lin**: He struggled for much of the game and finally got things going in the 4th. It was impressive how he showed resilience. Perhaps Lin's best quality is his fearlessness. Say what you want about his sometimes hapless defensive, or his lack of a left hand, or his relatively ""Below-The-Rim"" game, but he never back down from a tough situation. He takes the ball to the rim strong every time, unless he changes it up with a well timed floater, and he's not afraid of contact in the slightest. I'm pretty sure he's already gotten 2 bloody noses since taking over as the Knicks floor general. And when it matters most, Jeremy Lin comes to play. In the last 12 minutes it seems that Jeremy Lin just simply makes plays. 

3. **Carmelo Anthony**: Yes, he's cold. Yes, he takes bad shots still. But, you cannot deny the defensive intensity he has displayed since Mr. Potato Head (term of endearment) has taken the clipboard. He did a great job defending; last night especially. He closed out on jump shots by getting his hand up in their grill consistently, and occasionally made well timed swipes at the ball when a player got careless. While this is great, I wonder why it has taken him this long to start putting in an A effort on defense. Literally every great, and I mean *great* NBA superstar, has been an excellent defender. Jordan, Kobe, LeBron, Kareem, Russell, etc. have all been chosen to All-Defensive Teams in their careers. It's time for the Melo to become a consistent defender because he has certainly shown us that he has that potential.  

I'm excited for the Knicks going forward. They are absolutely stacked and the players seem to be buying into the whole team-first-defensive-minded-grind-it-out-at-any-cost mentality Woodson is instilling. Hopefully, this success is not fleeting.

**Strengths:** Decent shooter, ok scorer. Can get to the rim and finish. Pretty good off-ball player. He reminds me a lot of JR, but in both the good and bad ways.

**Weaknesses:** Not a great defender period. Probably too small to defend most forwards. I personally think he is a little overrated, likely due to his name. Takes bad shots and forces some shots. Inconsistent... had a great freshman year, terrible sophomore year and a decent junior year.

**Allen Crabbe - SG - 6'6'' - 200 lbs. - California**

**Projection:** Late 1st round

**Strengths:** Good scorer, good shooter, has NBA range. Good off-ball player. Could be a reliable scorer out of the box. Good length (6'11'' wingspan). Can be a capable defender with room to grow. Reminds me a little of JR, but he might not be as bad of a chucker.

**Weaknesses:** Limited ball handler, struggles with double teams and help defense. Not a great finishers at the rim. Not a great defender, but not terrible. Makes mental mistakes and gets lazy. Probably too small to defend most forwards.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

**Sergey Karasev -  SF - 6'7'' - 200 lbs. - Russia**

**Projection:** Mid to Late 1st round

**Strengths:** A lot of buzz around him lately, [Flip Saunders is in love](http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/sbnation/SBNation_20130602_NBA_Draft_2013__Flip_Saunders_compares_Sergey_Karasev_to_Toni_Kukoc.html) apparently (if that's a good thing). He's a great shooter and a good ball handler and passer for his size. He reminds me a little of Gallo or maybe Gordon Hayward. Good off the ball player. Could be a great addition for the Knicks, but he might get scooped up way before he gets to NY.

**Weaknesses:** Big surprise: defense. Not great at keeping guys in front of him. Do we really need another great shooter that can't play defense? Not a great athlete either (but not terrible, probably like Gallo). Needs to get bigger/stronger if he's going to guard forwards in the NBA. Doesn't go right well (he's a lefty).

**Reggie Bullock -  SF - 6'7'' - 200 lbs. - [North Carolina](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHnA94-hTC8)**

**Projection:** Late 1st round

**Strengths:** He's what I'm looking for in a wing player. He's a reliable shooter that plays defense and can rebound too. All things we could use on the perimeter. Might not be starting quality out of the box, but he could be a valuable bench player. Fights for 50/50 balls. He's also careful with the ball and doesn't commit many turnovers.

**Weaknesses:** Seems to be a common thread... but he's a little undersized for a wing player. He could stand to put on 20-30 pounds of muscle to help him guard larger players. Not a great ball handler and probably is never going to be a high volume scorer. Sometimes has trouble keeping opponents in front of him. Needs to develop some as a on-ball defender.

-----------------------------------------------------------

**Tony Mitchell - PF - 6'9'' - 235 lbs. - North Texas**

**Projection:** Late 1st round

**Strengths:** Great athlete. Explosive jumper. Perhaps a young Amare/Kenyon Martin. He also can shoot. Would be great for pick and pops. Might be able to stretch the defense with some three's too (D'Antoni would love him). He definitely could be a dangerous player on the pick and roll. Talented shot blocker, he uses his length well.

**Weaknesses:** He's average height for PF (he might be closer to 6'8'' than 6'9'') but has a great wingspan (7'3''). He had a bad season last year and didn't respond well to a coaching change. His stock has dropped as a result (which might be a good thing, he was a mid-round talent so the Knicks might get a deal on a good player). Takes bad shots sometimes and doesn't always give his full effort. So the question becomes: Will we see Mitchell's potential or will he not leave everything on the floor?

-----------------------------------------------------------------

**Gorgui Dieng -  C - 6'11'' - 245 lbs. - Louisville**

**Projection:** Mid to Late 1st round (this would be my pick)

**Strengths:** Great size and length (7'4'' wingspan). A lot more polished that Withey (but might not be there when the Knicks pick). He reminds me a little of Serge Ibaka. Strong defender, has enough strength to hold his own down low. ""Shown the ability to switch on screens and stay in front."" (go to 4:34 in the video for an example). Athletic and a good pick and roll player. Good rebounder, lots of hustle. He can pass and has developed a decent mid range shot.
 
**Weaknesses:** Needs to improve as a post player. Not extremely skilled and doesn't have many moves. He's not a high volume scorer either, at least at this point. Could be a little bit stronger, but he's gained weight since coming to the United States. Some extra strength might help out his low post defense (which is lacking).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**Jeff Withey - C - 7'0'' - 220 lbs. - Kansas**

**Projection:** Late 1st round

**Strengths**: Excellent defender and shot blocker. Protects the rim like a champ. Very athletic and a good pick and roll player. Reminds me a lot of Tyson, could be a good backup. Withey or Dieng would be nice to add some size to our lineup.

**Weaknesses:** Little offensive ability, can't shoot, can't post up (again, like Chandler). Hustle isn't great at times. He's tall and has a good wingspan (7'3'') but weighs only 220lb. In perspective, LeBron (a forward, obviously) is listed at 250 and Tyson Chandler is 235 lbs. He needs to put on some muscle or he's going to get consistently out-muscled in the paint.

These were just some of the guys I thought the Knicks could get in the late 1st round. The Knicks could obviously move up or down or a player could drop (ex. Shabazz Muhammad).

There are no point guards. Mostly because Isaiah Canaan and Brandon Triche are the only ones I've heard the Knicks are looking at, and they are both mid to late second rounders."	t5_2rur5	True

1365995324.0	1cd7jf	I'm from r/bostonceltics, what do you think of the match-up?	dangercart	19	3	18	"Hey r/nyknicks,

I'm a Celtics fan and wondering what you think of our match-up. I've seen a decent number of your games and think you're a better match-up for us than Indiana but that you're obviously the favorite with your recent play and home court advantage.

I think it's a good match-up for us because it's harder for you to create mismatches with Melo at PF because we can answer with Pierce and Green at the forward spots. If Chandler isn't fully healthy I think you'll have trouble stopping our offense (it will be low scoring because of pace but we should be possession efficient) but if he is then a lot will depend on if KG can draw him away from the hoop. If we had Rondo I'd be confident about the match-up but if he was we probably wouldn't be playing in the first round. I think you'll miss Ronnie Brewer because I'm not sure who can defend our second forward. I wish we had more consistent options to take advantage of your back-court.

Defensively we have the bodies to throw at Melo and Smith so, as it so often does, it will come down to if they're making contested shots. As with on the other end, the Chandler/KG match-up will be the one to watch. If KG isn't mobile enough to recover on Chandler's roll to the hoop it will collapse our perimeter and open up way too many threes. Interestingly, you killed us from three in the one game we won against you but that's the big fear for us. Seeing Pierce or Lee trying to recover to the corner 20 times just because KG just can't play his normal stellar defense is basically my nightmare for the series. That and seeing Melo go 15-25 despite good defense against him.

It looks like both teams will be as healthy as we've been in a while (though very obviously not as healthy as we'd like to be) which is good to see. What are you watching out for in the series and how do you expect it to play out?"	t5_2rur5	True
1365571516.0	1c1nw7	I don't give a shit about the streak or beating the bulls, sit Kenyon and Tyson no matter what	under9k	19	1	7	"No matter what. 

Melo can keep playing if he wants because he's unstoppable, but I don't care if we play the smallest team in the history of the NBA, we CAN NOT let Kenyon and Tyson be injured. We need at least one of them for Boston, both of them for Indiana, and both plus Amare for Miami.

They had Melo, Copeland, and JR as the frontcourt for some time against OKC and tonight, it really wasn't too awful. We'll have a chance to win, but I don't care at all if we lose.

In fact, the only game I think we should play those guys again is against Indiana. If we win that game, the second seed would basically be ours. Indiana would have to win every game and we'd have to lose every game.

Man, it would've been real nice if the cavs could've pulled out the win from the pacers.

What do you guys think?

That's the definition of being unselfish. He only had 5 assists, but I wish I could find stats on hockey assists, because watching the game, it really felt like him being double and triple-teamed opened up the floor for others, and he just rolled with it.
-Tyson Chandler is thriving. He's towards the top of the league in offensive and total rebounds. He's had 3 games in a row with at least 20 rebounds. He's also getting more aggressive in the paint, taking hook shots and layups when he can't jam the ball.
-Amar'e Stoudamire and JR Smith are both playing like they love the game. Both those players suck when they play angry, with a chip on their shoulder. It's a chicken/egg situation, but they're successful when they look like they're having fun. Amar'e seems to have successfully transformed himself from a shooter into a post player, which is very important for his coexistence with Carmelo Anthony."	t5_2rur5	True

* vs Detroit       .386
* @Washington   .262 (though 7-3 for their last 10)
* @Minnesotta    .415
* vs. LA Clippers .717 (at least it's at home)
* vs. Toronto      .364 (lol.... Canada) 
* @ Indiana        .591 (worried about this one)
* @ Toronto        .364 (lol.... Canada) 
* vs Philadelphia  .419 
* vs. Golden State .605 (again at home... phew!) 

So as you guys can see, there doesn't seem to be too many scary games this month... hopefully that gives us a chance to get this whole chemistry thing down.

EDIT: If you haven't done the math yet that leaves us with an opponents winning percentage average of just .434 and only 11 games in 28 days (thats how many days in February right?... lemme count my knuckles)...

The Knicks are without Carmelo Anthony tonight, who is nursing a sore ankle. The Knicks are winners of three straight and are yet to lose a home game this season. Here's hoping those trends continue tonight against a feisty Cavs team that just got Kyrie Irving back.

2) JR, Melo, Amare, and Baron havent played together enough for any kind of criticism to be fairly placed against them.

3) The knicks were getting fouled every time they got the ball and at least 40-60% of those resulted in no calls. Honestly, I couldnt believe how shitty the refs were and at a knicks home game no less.

4) Why would we want anyone on our team to give 110% against the nets anyway? Of what consequence would winning against them be? I'd rather lose tonight and be healthy against miami than win and watch stat get his knees torn apart.

5) More than anything else, the knicks need experience and every game played is one game more of knowing what works, what doesn't, what to develop, and what to drop. 

Obviously a loss always hurts and getting the W would have been nice but going crazy and starting up the panic artistry like we always do when we dont win decisively is bad for everyone and honestly, embarrassing as a fellow fan.

**Carmelo Anthony**

Season	Team	G	GS	MPG	FG%	3p%	FT%	OFF	DEF	RPG	APG	SPG	BPG	TO	PF	PPG

Carmelo Anthony is the Knicks franchise player, and the man expected to lead this team to an NBA Title. And while it remains to be seen if he can truly be the savior Knicks fans have hoped for, it is clear that Carmelo Anthony is keeping the Knicks competitive (sometimes singlehandedly) in a very tough Eastern Conference. Melo is one of the best, if not the best, scorer in the NBA, and it’s easy to see why.  Melo has the ability to score, seemingly effortlessly, from anywhere on the court, and has one of the best pull up jumpers in the game.  His offensive ability helped to carry the Knicks to 54 wins and their first division title in 19 years, all on the way to the NBA Scoring Title-the first in his career.  However, it is easy to question his offensive efficiency.  He shot only 45% from the field this season: the NBA’s 2nd best scorer Kevin Durant shot 51%.  On the defense end, Melo is considerably less dominant.  Looking at his stats, he trails elite players such as Lebron James and Durant in nearly every statistical category, his only advantage being in PPG.  Many have expressed concern over the effort he puts on defense.  As with the rest of the Knicks roster, health and age are something of a concern for Melo.  Late last spring he missed several games during the Knicks wildly unsuccessful West Coast road trip due to a bad knee.  Though he came back from those injuries playing great, it’s worrisome to think of the Knicks playing long stretches without him.  For the upcoming season, Melo will obviously be gunning for another scoring title, but several things need to change.  He has often been seen as a me-first player, and while he is the Knicks best scorer, a couple more Assists Per Game wouldn’t hurt.  If he combines that with more defensive tenacity, he will continue to not only be one of the leagues best, but possibly work his way into the MVP discussion.

**Andrea Bargnani**

Season	Team	G	GS	MPG	FG%	3p%	FT%	OFF	DEF	RPG	APG	SPG	BPG	TO	PF	PPG
12-13	TOR	35	25	28.7	0.399	0.309	0.844	0.7	2.9	3.7	1.1	0.6	0.7	1.5	1.8	12.7

Completely limited by the salary cap, Knicks GM Glen Grunwald did not have much room to operate this offseason.  Yet one of his biggest, and most controversial, moves was the trade he orchestrated with Toronto, which brought 2006 first overall pick Bargnani to the Knicks in exchange for Steve Novak, Marcus Camby, Quentin Richardson, a 2016 first round pick and 2 second round picks (2014, 2017).  While the departures of Novak, Camby, and Richardson were accepted, giving up 3 draft picks were not.  The Knicks had two big holes they needed to fill this offseason, rebounding and defense; Bargnani fills neither of them.  In addition, the former first rounder has spent his career underachieving in Toronto, and that’s putting it lightly.  He played only 66 games over the last two seasons due to injuries, not ideal for a Knicks roster already plagued by injury history.  However, despite all of this, Bargnani has the potential to thrive in New York.  His best career performance, 41 points on 67% shooting, 7 rebounds, and six assists, came at Madison Square Garden in 2010.  While he was slowed by injuries the past two years, he did average 21.4 points per game in the 2010-11 season.  At 7’ he brings size to a Knicks roster that was dominated in that department by Indiana in last seasons playoffs.  He can stretch the floor, be a threat from both mid-range and downtown. He can backup injury prone Amar’e Stoudemire.  And most importantly, he no longer has to be the number one option for a team that boos him.  All things considered, this could be a huge move for the Knicks, and a career year for Bargnani, as long as he stays healthy.

**Tyson Chandler**

Season	Team	G	GS	MPG	FG%	3p%	FT%	OFF	DEF	RPG	APG	SPG	BPG	TO	PF	PPG
12-13	NYK	66	66	32.8	0.637	0.000	0.694	4.1	6.6	10.7	0.9	0.6	1.1	1.3	2.8	10.4

Only one year removed from winning Defense Player of the Year, it was easy for many to think Chandler underachieved last season-especially when Roy Hibbert made 7’1’’ Chandler look like he was 6’4’’.  However, Chandler did have quite the season.  He averaged a double-double for only the second time in his career, was the backbone of a Knicks defense that turned many heads in November, and was in the top 10 of Field Goal percentage.  Unfortunately, Chandler’s season was derailed late in the season by a bulging disk, followed by the flu, which caused him to lose 10 pounds.  Offensively, Chandler’s only skills come from operating the pick-and-roll with Felton, and setting screens for Carmelo Anthony.  Ideally, if Chandler could develop any type of shot of his own, he could stretch the floor, forcing defenses to shy away from doubling Anthony, and though he vowed to add offense to his repertoire, it’s tough to believe he actually will.  Chandler is one of the 4 players who will be coming off the books in 2015, and it’s expected that the Knicks will use that cap space to upgrade.  In the meantime, fans can expect Chandler to continue to anchor the Knicks defense, and produce so long as Felton stays healthy.

**Raymond Felton**

Felton was one of the many casulties of the Carmelo Anthony trade back in 2010, but before he was traded, he was a catalyst for the Knicks offense.  Though Knicks fans were upset to see Jeremy Lin depart for Houston, Felton did a great job as the main man.  Though Melo is the most important piece of the Knicks offense, it all runs through Felton.  While he was injured last winter, the Knicks offense suffered, Chandler’s FG percentage in particular.  In addition to running the pick-and-roll, Felton has offensive strengths in his own right.  When Melo was not producing in game 4 of the Boston playoff series, with JR out, Felton led a Knicks comeback in the 2nd half, scoring 27 points in what eventually ended as an overtime loss to Boston.  How efficiently Felton plays next season will be key to how well the Knicks perform.

With the 24th pick in the draft, the Knicks weren’t in a position to draft a future franchise player, but regardless, Hardaway was a steal at the 24th overall pick.  A good shooter with experience in a championship setting at Michigan, he can bolster an already deep backcourt.  Though he will have to earn his minutes playing behind Shumpert and Smith, this has the potential to be a good pick up for the Knicks.

Going undrafted, he was considered to be a steal for the Knicks.  At NC State he was a prolific scorer who could use his size advantageously and stretch the floor. However, his focus and dedication have often come into question, which may be why he went undrafted. Hopefully a year in Woodson’s system will help change that.

O, Basketball Gods, bestow upon us your love and endearment, and enable us to reach the promised land. For we have suffered enough pain and turmoil. Since the dark days of Reggie Miller, we have endured through the ruthless onslaught of would-be defilers. The Dark Lord Isaiah Thomas sought to topple our beautiful kingdom by appointing the likes of Stephon Marbury, Steve Francis, Eddy Curry, Channing Frye, and Renaldo Balkman to do it's bidding. But we succumbed not to the Dark Lord's evil plight! Together we have forged a new world, free of corruption and terrible scouting.

1. Knicks desperately need Amar'e back, teams like Memphis/Chicago with very talented bigs overwhelm Chandler who is basically fighting for rebounds by himself.

2. Noah is INCREDIBLY important to the Bulls team, without him on the court (in addition to the Bulls trying to wait the clock out) the Knicks scored 45 points in the 4th.

3. Knicks need to get Copeland out there more, he's as consistent as any other shooter on the knicks (probably moreso) and even though his defense isn't optimal he plays with hustle and urgency.

4. I feel like people will chuck this up to ""whining"" but the reffing was EXTREMELY atrocious last game. Worst I've seen in my life. Examples? Prigioni swats a ball out of bounds, it's called a jump ball. Kidd intentionally shoves a Bulls player (no call), who in turn stumbles four steps travelling (no call). Noah was calmly ad politely voicing his opinion on a bad call, gets called for a T. Kidd, defending Nate who was travelling, has to yell the appropriate call at the ref so that he'll call it. That's just off the top of my head, I'm sure there's more. 

5. Chandler (though one of the most important players on the Knicks) clogs the lane and slows the offense a bit. Felton's shooting/lay-up woes are only amplified by the fact that Chandler camps in the paint with his defender. The paint was instantly opened up when Chandler/Noah left and Felton got to the rim and scored at will.

*We know what Ray Felton can do when he lays off the Doritos. It is acceptable and affordable.
*Passing on Lin give the Knicks a little more flexibility next year. Maybe go after Chris Paul.

1334756678.0	sfz8w	Breakdown of the last 5 games and what it will take for the 6th seed.	kevjacobi	15	1	19	"The Knicks enter tonight's game against the Nets 4 games back of the Magic with 5 games to play.  While this seems like an impossible amount of ground to make up, the schedule and the fact that the Magic are without Howard provide a glimmer of hope.  The remaining schedules are:

KNICKS
@Nets
@Cavaliers 
@Hawks
Clippers
@Bobcats

MAGIC
@Celtics
@Jazz
@Nuggets
Bobcats
@Grizzlies 

Assuming the Magic beat the Bobcats at home, they would need to lose all four road games, which certainly seems possible as all 4 of those teams are fighting for playoff positioning.

The Knicks, on the other hand, would have to win out.  The Nets, Cavs and Bobcats have pretty much packed it in for the season so if the Knicks don't play down to the competition (which is completely possible that they do in one of these games) those should be wins.  I like the Clippers match up at home, especially if the Knicks are still in the hunt for the 6 seed by then.  The Hawks on the road is the toughest game in the final stretch IMO.

1327091082.0	opa84	An angry Knick fan...the road to here.	jrzang89	17	3	19	Ok, so I’m just gonna poor out every kept emotion I’ve had with the knicks since last season. Right before Amare came to the knicks, I took at a look at there roster up and down. We still had tracy mcgrady believe it or not, and I was gettin in my 2k time. I had just moved out of my friends house and into a college dorm where I now owned a tv and could finally root for the knicks on tv. I had a very early idea...i wanted to be a real knicks fan and watch every single game of the season and follow them along so I could build a cool relationship with a basketball team. Amare comes through, and the knicks are sick. Felton, Fields, Gallo, W. Chandler, and Amare. A young sick point guard (who I knew Dantoni would work well with), my favorite player on the knicks rookie Landry Fields, a young white itallian kid (me being a young white italian I liked minus his lack of d) and an athletic quick pf who could even switch up and play the 3. AND who can forget the best player of all...Timofy Mozgof. Man, what a team. What a rich athletic young team. They were nobodies, I was a nobody, and better yet, the basketball was how basketball SHOULD be played. The ball moving around, all players touching it. No the knicks werent perfect, heck they werent ready for a championship. Everyone who sat around jacking off to the games knew that. That wasnt the point. The point was...We Were Winning! FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME the knicks had a WINNING record. It was sick. We had one of the best records in the east and everything was going well. Until...around the middle of the season, the fans (the knicks fans who are famous for loving the game and knowledge of the sport) began chanting something other then MVP in the crowd. They started cheering “We want Melo”. This started a chain reaction, because suddenly rumors and talks started to brew, and our players had their confidence drop. Even Dantoni asked the crowed to stop those chants because it was effecting the players game. I was fortunate to go the the Knicks vs Hawks game before the trade, and saw it with my own eyes. Instead of supporting the players who fought night in and night out, everyone had signs with a bible verses and we want melo. To say it quite frank, new yorks got a HARD DICK for the mere thought of melo. While I was at the game I went to the bar to get shit faced, and saw on the television highlight footage of Melo...on the nuggets! Knicks fans were getting such a hard dick for melo that seeing him play (even on another team) was like watching pornography. It was disgusting the level of idol worship that was brewing in msg. I remember being at the bar and mentioning it to the guy and him also thinking it was ridiculous. A few days later it happened. Felton, gallo, chandler, mozgov, and a couple of bench players --&gt; melo and billups. I was tight, mainly cuz my boi felton fought so hard and was the real reason for our success. However having chauncy cushioned the blow cuz he was a smart pg who I watched beat the lakers a few years ago for the championship against LA. Even tho he is old now I knew he’d help a depleted knicks roster. **The reason we made this trade by the way was that Melo had indeed expressed ‘interest’ in coming to NY however (and any real basketball fan can tell you) he was a free agent the next season free to sign with whomever he chose. But instead of choosing new york...he chose his contract. Alot of knicks fans with boners for melo forget that little ditty. At the end of the day melo wanted a contract extension and was even willing to resign with denver if it meant getting more money. Even nj was a possible destination. The knicks (who knew melo wanted $) acted desperately as the chants FROM KNICK FANS became louder. So that is how we ended up with melo. Chauncy was merely thrown in the equation to make the deal work, and he in fact wanted to retire in denver. But it’s cool cuz hey man...its all good. We got melo! THEN THE WORST possible thing happened. Knicks raised their ticket prices. Before a single game was played. It went from real basketball fans in the stands to “suits &amp; children” neither of which would know shit about basketball. Since that trade the knicks started to lose. Because the knicks did so great with felton and our old crew they managed to hold onto their playoff spot (even though they nearly lost it and sunk from 4th to if I remember correctly around 6th). They went to the playoffs, first time since I was in high school). After a series of unfortunate events, a depleted bench, and whatever else, the knicks got really hurt and were eliminated first round. Come to think of it, had the knicks kept their 4th maybe 3rd spot advancing to the 2nd round seemed very likely...anyways...due to forces out of anyones control we lost. But that was ok! Cuz we now had our new “big 3” billups melo and amare. All we needed was a good bench, time to get adjusted, maybe a center (we were thinking dalembert at the time) and it would all be spick and span. Then after the lockout and during the next season with expectations very high, we made another move. We cut Chauncy’s ass (cuz he’s old right? Fuck dat) and we brought in tyson chandler and baron davis (who is essentially broken with injuries). I also want it to be known that tyson is a great player and championship winner, I just would not leave a team point guardless because (as any real basketball player knows) we could sit here and masturbate till our balls turn blue that we have 2 “halloffammers” yea whatever bullshit but we NEED  a point guard otherwise we couldnt beat the washington generals...or the wizards for that matter. Especially with a fullcourt offense mastermind like dantoni.  As knick fans we are sitting 15 games into the regular season with a terrible team and everyone knows it. Fucking up the chemistry meant fields isnt playing like he used to, amare’s game is off, we have no back court ( except iman thank god) and everyone is off. And yet we are all sitting around with flacid dicks wondering how all this happened. (ironically we are doing the same sort of thing with the economy, but that’s neither here or there). The point is when I look back at who to blame for this mess, I blame...the fans. As much as I want to blame melo, maybe even donnie walsh, maybe I blame the lockout, maybe I blame god, either way...the famous knick fans who know everything about basketball couldnt see this coming. It was similar to watching the jews kill christ. Crucifying the good guys. I believe the ghost of raymond felton will forever haunt the knicks. Baron davis will never be who he was and at best we’ll get a fucked up point guard to manage our team, great. That will last 2 years before his back spazzes out again at most. The greed...and the hormones, of ny fans is disgusting. As I watch the game every fat cat and their stupid kids are wearing melo jerseys as the ship is sinking at an alarming rate. Atleast they can still play 2k and shoot the ball with melo and masturbate to that. If I could end this all it would be with gollum being thrown into the lake of fire still holding onto...my precious. 	t5_2rur5	True

When JR/Kidd/Shump were all in full-on choke mode and Novak was too much of a liability on D and playmaking, Pacers D packed the paint and took away Melo's room.

1. The latest victim is Pablo Prigioni.  Having an all-around nice season and Woodson flat out benches him.  
2. Woody decimated Novak's confidence by benching him when he was on-fire last season.  Has not been the same player since (though, he is playing better defense).
3. Lets Melo, Chandler, and JR get away with laziness on offense.  Chandler has not been o-boarding like he was earlier in the year. JR and Melo chuck.  It's not offense people.  Greg Pop would have an aneurism.  
4. Copeland debacle.  Here's a guy who showed immense potential and doesn't even play a minute some games.
5. James White starts the half and plays great D, makes some buckets, then disappears to the point where he becomes too garbage for garbage minutes.
6. Kidd is such a necessary leader.  Players don't buy in to Chandler, but they do buy into Kidd.  He needs more meaningful minutes and less garbage time minutes.
7. Camby! This guy plays smart bball, but Woodson doesn't give him time.  He's 6 fouls and 15+ yrs of NBA experience.  He was throwing alley-oops one game.  Find this man some time Woody.

When Felton gets back he will force teams to collapse towards the interior leaving our perimeter shooters with more room to get shots off. Not only that, but we will see Chandler and Stat becoming much more effective with the pick and roll (because lets face it, our other point guards are to slow to be really effective with it).

And if Lin continues to average 15 points, 8 to 10 assists, and 2 to 3 turnovers a game, I think he'll be worth more than $5 million a year.

He also has some good to great games offensively. This is simply not enough I think the announcer on SPURS network tonight put it pretty well, that number 1 might as well be a mannequin on the defensive end of the court. We have Carmelo he can carry the load offensively. If Stoudemire gave effort on both sides of the court he could be a force to reckon with. Lastly his knees are clearly shot. He can't put back offensive rebounds, and run to his spots before his defenders like he was able to do in Phoenix. Lastly what happened to his post, and toast game?

Today's decision to not resign Jeremy Lin is about more than Jeremy Lin. It marks the complete and utter sabotage of everything Donnie Walsh did to rebuild the franchise. It marks the conscious severing of the silver lining thrown to us by fate.

First off, congratulations on a good season. It's nice to have NY back in the playoffs.

I'm a mod over at /r/bostonceltics where we've built a tool to help fans play GM and try to map out their off-season decisions against the CBA rules. This tool is at an early stage right now because a lot of key data elements (like the 2013-14 cap figure and draft order) haven't been finalized yet but we're putting it out for some users right now for testing. Our goal is to post it onto /r/NBA right at the end of the season so we're trying to flush out any performance or math issues.

If you're interested in giving it a try, please [**come over to my post on our sub**](http://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/1eb703/fantasy_gm_roster_builder_tool_for_201314/) and take a look.

I'm posting this to a handful of teams so if you have questions about the tool, the CBA or your team's particular decisions you can post them right in this thread and I'll try to answer them. If you post Knicks questions in /r/bostonceltics you might get down-voted but you can also post in that thread. I'm not an expert, just a nerd who's read way to much of Larry Coon's CBA FAQ.

**Please do not cross post this to any other subs or distribute to anyone else as it is still just a beta version.**

2. Teams are starting to take advantage of him. Part of it is the team defense and the constant over-switching but opposing guards are tearing him apart.
3. This offense is different than it was earlier in the year. As said before, teams are starting to figure them out and we have become increasingly iso-driven. How many times have we seen Kidd or Felton repeatedly just toss it to Melo and clear out? Melo is great but we can't live on that.

It will also be interesting to see Harden in a Rockets uniform, something that I haven't been able to do since the very beginning of the season. Otherwise, the Rockets are a top-heavy team with a bunch of prospects and what doesn't seem from the outside like a lot of cohesion or much of a plan. 

But watching the Knicks is always fun, and I'm sure the game will be interesting no matter what. The Knicks have been grinding this sort of game out and wearing out inferior opponents in their own arenas, so hopefully that will contine tonight in Houston.

The Rockets will be without Carlos Delfino, while the Knicks have no injuries to report (other than Amare being out, but that hardly bears mentioning until there's news).

However, the Knicks were doing something interesting in Games 1-3.  They've been playing pretty gritty, tough D, and that combined with consistent point guards is leading to great pass and find the open shot offense (well, not so much last night.  But, one game does not make a trend).

I think we'll begin to know if this is REAL  when we play back to back games against San Antonio and Memphis.

San Antonio's the other team that's playing TEAM basketball.  They're 5-1, and Duncan's turned back the clock.  That said, they looked really old when they lost to the Clippers the other day (or maybe the Clippers looked young and athletic).

I love the Memphis team (the players).  They play great defense.  Zach Randolph found his home in Memphis (and not here).  The guy has been a beast on the boards.  And let's not forget they were the start of our losing streak under D'Antoni last year.  And combining that with Gasol, I'm not sure how well our lineup with Anthony starting at the 4 is going to work.  I think they're going to miss O.J. Mayo though.

So if we beat them, I'm going to start to begin believing this thing is real.

I'll want to see how we compare against Miami and L.A.

Also, quit hating on Stoudemire unless he turns out to continue sucking at playing defense.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHmvkRoEowc"	t5_2rur5	True

Would it be a roster change? Do you think they need to work on certain aspects of the game? Strength training? 

For Example: I think we should get rid of D'Antoni, and hire either Larry Brown, or Jeff Van Gundy both are experienced defensive minded playoff coaches and are currently not coaching any teams. I do not think trading any of our players would really help us. But I do see some holes for example our second units front court could use help and muscle. I think we need to find more spot up shooters, for the D'Antoni system to work, but if we ran more of a half court offense who we have now would be fine. I think our defensive scheming is our biggest problem. We switch too much, and there are glaring mismatches that are never fixed throughout entire games. Also offesnively we have improved greatly since the beggining of the season, but there is still too much ball stoppage with Amare and Carmelo. I think these players need to get into their rhythms. Miami had some of the same problems, but their defense allowed them to overcome the lack of offense. I think on the offensive side of the ball they feature one of their all-stars a quarter or string of plays at a time, and whoever has a better defensive matchup usually ends up being the finisher, and premier player of the game. I really like D'Antoni as a person, and he is great at drafting players, and building a competitive team and I can see his system being more successful that it was in Phoenix just not with this Knicks team. He is not making good use of what we have.  "	t5_2rur5	True

1373158805.0	1hs10p	Where the minutes will go.	nicejerk	10	0	10	"As of today, we have lost a total of 9 players who played some role on the team. (Kidd, White, Camby, Novak, Wallace, Richardson, Brewer, Thomas, Copeland).  These players have played a total of 6659 minutes. Here's the breakdown in order of most minutes played:

- Kidd (2043)
- Novak (1641)
- Copeland (862)
- Brewer (711)
- White (435)
- Thomas (392)

The rest were under 300 minutes (which is about 4 minutes per game), so I'm not going to bother to list them. But, clearly, we can see that the two players who have the biggest shoes to fill are Kidd and Novak. I'm going to miss Copeland (he was one of my favorites) but, I think we'll manage replacing his 862 minutes (or, roughly 10.5 minutes per game).

###Kidds Minutes###
As of now, I can see some of those minutes transferring over to Felton and Prigioni, but a good chunk of them will probably go to Shumpert. For a good portion of the season, Kidd played along side Prigioni and Felton as the SG until (and after) Shumpert came back from his injury. With Shumpert starting the season fresh, I think we can safely assume that the production that Kidd gave us last season will not be as good as what we're expecting from Shumpert (given an extra 1000 minutes next season). 

###Novak's Minutes###
Novak was bad. In hindsight, we may have rolled the dice once (or 50 times) too many. His 1600+ minutes will now go to Bargnani. This could be good, or bad. The good is that Bargnani, even in his worst year was still better than what Novak gave us last year. The bad is that Bargnani played 80 games (09-10) was his only time playing 80 games. If he stays healthy, Bargnani will be a HUGE improvement over Novak with the potential to be a 15-18ppg deep-threat 7 footer.

###Remaining minutes (roughly 36 combined minutes per game)###
This is where our role players will have to come up big for us. Hardaway will have to play his best Chris-Copeland impression, which will not be easy. We lost quite a bit of rebounds by losing Wallace, Camby and Thomas. This is my biggest concern going into the season because we'll be relying on a (hopefully healthy) Stoudemire to replace those minutes. This is why I feel Elton Brand would be a perfect fit for this team. He could easily help replace those missing rebounds.

So, going into the season, I think we've covered ourselves with our lost minutes. Shumpert and Prigioni will take Kidd's minutes. Bargnani will take Novak's minutes. And Stoudemire will simply need to replace Wallace's, Camby's and Thomas' production. I don't think any of these three expectations are too much to ask for, which is why I don't see a reason why this team can't perform at last year's level, or better.

Obviously due to his restricted minutes he's going to come off the bench, but I think it necessitates swapping JR with shump in our starting lineup. Having 2 elite scorers on bench squad with only one starting just seems ridiculous to me(although with Felton's recent performance I'd say he is a fringe case for another dependable scorer). 

1.  With JR starting Melo will have some pressure taken off him and hopefully we could see less iso ball
2. I believe K-mart will be able to help alleviate the defensive woes a STAT return to the second unit will necessitate
3. Look at our recent efficiency numbers, a guy that scores a reliable 10+ points on a high fg% is exactly what we need right now. We live and die by the jumpshot, but having a staple couldn't hurt us.

What do you guys think? Would Woodson keep JR coming off the bench to maintain Shump's defensive contribution to the starting unit? Would giving Novak's minutes to STAT be able to be a drawback in any way (or give melo a little extra rest)? This is also all barring us getting out of this round, which I'm fairly worried about.
