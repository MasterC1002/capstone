1374196232.0	1ilnjq	Had a very special wood delivery today	haudi	179	19	31	"I've never experienced amazing service like this before. On Monday, I tweeted @LouieMuellerBBQ (Top 4 in Texas Monthly's best BBQ in Texas list and featured on DDD on Food Network) asking where I could buy traditional post oak in the Houston area. Wayne Mueller, the owner, tweeted me back and asked me how much I was looking for. I told him 5 - 10 lbs for my home smoker, to which he replied ""Don't worry, I got you covered."" 

Sure enough, today he hand delivered post oak from his wood stash all the way from Taylor, TX to Houston, TX. And he wouldn't take anything for it. He is an absolutely fascinating and incredibly kind person for doing this for a random person who tweeted him. Just goes to show how awesome the BBQ community is down here in Texas. 

I'm pretty stoked!

1366046362.0	1ceeny	New policy on meme posts	mattbin	125	29	76	"Recently there has been some discussion about meme posts on /r/BBQ. The mods here have looked at the issue and decided that meme posts do not have a place in this subreddit, as they do not contribute to the discussion and enjoyment of BBQ.

We have updated the description to reflect this. Any future meme posts will be deleted.

Thanks everyone for your many contributions and keep your wood smokin'. If you have any questions or comments, you can message the moderators any time.

**Edit:** to answer the most common question here, no, memes were not overrunning the sub. However, the one that was posted recently did inspire some negative messages as well as mod messages, and we decided it was probably best to set the policy clearly.

Some members have also pointed out that pics of meat, smoked or raw, without comments or recipes, do not contribute much either. I agree that users who post these pics should include some commentary with them in the comments. If they don't, feel free to ask them for more information.

About a month ago the food probe just started reading LLL almost all the time, once in a while it will give a temp for a few minutes, then go back to LLL and the BBQ probe would once in a blue moon go to LLL for a few moments then go back to the temp.

Called Maverick, they answered the phone in a few rings. I spoke to a nice lady and just explained the situation and asked who I should talk to, if it was under warranty, etc.

Her reply: ""We will ship you out two new probes under warranty, I just need your name and shipping info.""

That easy!!

Maverick, you guys are doing it right! If your customer service stays that awesome, and your products stay as good as that thermometer has been to me in the last few months, I have zero reason to go anywhere else.

I wanted to drop this here as customer service is a big part of why many people will or won't buy a product. I would recommend them, without a doubt after this.

TL;DR: Bought a Maverick wireless thermometer 5 months ago, probes started failing, 4 minutes on the phone and they are shipping me out new ones, no hoops to jump through; just awesome customer service."	t5_2qxww	True

My first go: 3 spare rib racks w/ dry rub, Atomic Buffalo Turds (though I admit, I didn't say that's what they were called), and bacon wrapped, rubbed chicken breast halves on an Applewood chip smokebox, gas grill. 5 hours@225 for the ribs, 2 hours for chix and ABT's.  BOOM GO THE TASTEBUDS.  A vegetarian neighbor ate one of the ribs on the insistence of her husband and loved it.  



Lessons learned: it takes a long time to clean up those ribs, silverskin is tricky, and adds significantly to the prep time. Next time, I'll trim the tips off the ribs after I cook em, so they don't end up in the trash when the picky folks don't want to eat them.  



Tough decisions... I wished I would have had access to a real smoker, not a problem, wife tried her first rib and told me I could get one. Hardest part is deciding what to cook next.

I had no idea how to weld or the slightest inkling of how much work was involved in making a BBQ pit. The endeavor began with a simple conversation between friends and revolved around the quality of retail bbq pits. My friend had been around the block, he's made several pits, been through welding classes and has quite a bit of welding experience. By the end of the conversation, I had agreed to help him with a new pit and he'd help me with mine.

Work began a couple weeks later. We'd scrap together hours after work and on weekends, a lot of hours. We built my friends pit first, as I learned metal working by example and one-on-one tutorials. I'm a computer guy, a network engineer and systems admin by profession. This project was out of my world, but somehow I ended up loving it. After a few months and several hundred man-hours, the first pit rolled off the line and started smokin'. My friend had his pit and I had some experience.

After a few weeks break, we launched into my pit. The pics above are from this build. I got to take the helm on design and features. It was great seeing hand drawn plans find their way into standing steel. I was able to do most of the welding and parts manufacture by this point. And still got plenty of pointers on how to improve. After another set of several hundred man-hours number 2 rolled out of the shop. I now have a nice metalworking shop and tools of my own, and a great new hobby that's very practical. I'm proud of it and hope y'all like it.

That said, personally, I'd like to kick the place up a notch - kinda fix things up maybe. What I'm suggesting here is a bit of subreddit customization - you've seen it elsewhere - so how about here? [This] (http://i.imgur.com/K1TWh.jpg) is an idea of what I mean.

1354730927.0	14c07r	16 pound pork shoulder this Saturday... forecast is -1F with windchill of -15F... wheee!	alaorath	39	4	26	"Too late to call it off, the guests have already been salivating in the RSVPs.  It will be a cold one, but I think I'm prepared:

* 2 extra bags of charcoal
* 6-pack of firebricks to line the insides
* plan is 6-8 hours on smoke, then finish in the oven (or whenever my toes freeze off)
* **[edit:1]** plywood for a windbreak, and move the BBQ closer to the door.

I was toying with the idea of buying fiberglass insulation to wrap the BBQ, but I think it will be more of a hassle than it's worth.  I do have 2 old wool blankets I don't mind sacrificing if the temperature regulation becomes unreasonable.

**[edit:2]** Since there's been several questions/comments, here's my setup:

* cheapo [Char-Griller propane unit](http://www.lowes.com/pd_296447-49769-3001_0__?productId=3031229&amp;Ntt=bbq) with optional side firebox (I so want a Green Egg!  maybe this summer)
* ample supply of lump charcoal (3 x 25 pound bags)
* 1 full 25 pound propane tank and a warm water tub for it (emergency backup heat)
* roughly 15 pounds of applewood chunks (fist sized or smaller)
* last night I setup the scraps of plywood I had as a windbreak, and moved the BBQ so it's backed into the corner - out of the worst of the wind (thanks to **Hillside_Strangler** and **twobrain** for the suggestion).
* dual-probe thermometer will be used to measure grill and meat temperatures throughout the adventure.
* I de-boned and cut the meat into 2 chunks (thanks **chaz345**), tonight I'll give it a deep rub treatment and seal it back up...

Will post pics of the setup (and progress) on Saturday once I get started.  I'm actually getting really excited thinking about it... I could be crazy.  :P

**[edit:3]** forecast for tomorrow is getting worse... -6F with windchill up to -20F. Spirits (and ethanol spirits) are still high.

1358282734.0	16n0c3	School Meat Smoker Project	suesse	37	9	39	"Hi guys,

For my 3rd year Electrical Engineering design project I am building a custom electric meat smoker.  What I want it to be is PID controlled with 2 internal temperature probes, 4 meat temperature probes, a 1500 Watt element, and a wood weight monitoring station.  All of this data will be relayed to your smartphone where you can monitor everything in time vs temperature graphs, and control the temperature using your smartphone. For now we are just going to be using an old steel fridge for the smoker. When I am done I will be posting this to instructables for anyone to build.

For our design we are required to have ""customers"" to interview to ensure our design is meeting your needs.  I was hoping you guys could tell me any additional features or specs that you would want the smoker to have and we will ensure that it meets them.  This can be operating temperature range, amount of temperature probes, operating range of wireless, cost, etc.  Please leave no stone unturned for ideas as you will all have access to the plans eventually.

Thank you very much and I look forward to your replies."	t5_2qxww	True

GrizzlyDog	32	2	10	"Okay so I had [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/BBQ/comments/1iwcva/can_i_use_aluminum_to_make_a_smokenator/) question-based thread going wondering if I could make a smokenator out of a commercial grade baking sheet (aluminum).

Did some poking around with Google.  Found this [guy](http://thewildhoneysuckle.wordpress.com/2011/10/22/diy-smokenator/) and shamelessly stole his schtick (I know - fuck me right?).

Here's how it turned out. 

Cost:
$14 for the baking sheet.
$4 new jigsaw blade (wood blade, medium fine teeth)

I used a [cardboard form](http://i.imgur.com/rXnwzVL.jpg) to get the actual dimensions right.  I think this was the most work actually.

Then, I traced it onto the baking sheet.

I was going to do a square water dish, but dammit I couldn't find one that would fit properly.  I even tried a commercial kitchen supply shop - all theirs were like 5 or 6"" deep and wouldn't fit (depth-wise - go figure!).

So instead I used a [big 2 cup mug](http://i.imgur.com/n4zizlT.jpg) I had from camping - I just took the handle off and it's round so I know *that* will totally throw the whole works off, right?  It's made of the same stuff as a percolator coffee pot I have that I place right on coals all the time so I know it is fine for the heat.  Basically same materials as the Weber kettle itself.

I cut it out with a regular jigsaw (and not a high-end one at that - where the fuck did I put my good jigsaw???).  [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/3aJ1X64.jpg) what's left of the baking sheet.

And [here's](http://i.imgur.com/Ozbs7Oc.jpg) the finished product.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/bIKU7h1.jpg) it is in place in the BBQ.

Now, hopefully, this weekend I will do some test runs on it.

I'll do the whole 12 lit coals to 48 and play with the temps and report back.  See if I melted my BBQ or not.  Hopefully not.

In any event, it took only couple of hours.  Less if I do it again, now I have the form - maybe 45 mins?  Less?  Jigsaw cuts quick with a sharp blade.

Bending it was a bit of a trick but I used an old B&amp;D WorkMate bench/vise and then used a square of plywood to apply even pressure and it bent surprisingly well.

The trickiest part was lining up the smokenator tabs that grab the spot welded Weber tabs holding up the cooking grate.

So anyway.  OP didn't completely deliver ...yet.  I'll post the pictures of the fire crew and insurance agent after I get it running.

**EDIT1:**  Thanks for the comments folks!  I like to suggest you NOT TRY THIS YOURSELF **UNTIL I'VE TESTED THIS THING!**    Remember:  **It's aluminum** and there's been some skepticism as to whether it will stand up to 6 hrs of coals.  I WILL report back in a week on this.   I'm going to really heat the thing if I can get the temp that high.  

I simply don't want to be responsible for any fused kettles or melted piles of shiny stuff (except my own).

Cheers!

I can't remember the name of the rub (nor can I find the post with the link), but it used a lot of pepper and came out amazing!

Smoked for 15.5 hours (had some temp issues at the start with all the cold meat in the smoker) over hickory chunks, apple chips and JD oak barrel chips.

Brought to a big park party in Oakland and everyone really enjoyed pulled pork sandwiches.  Got my money back from all the expenses, was able to make some money for the event organizers and still had an entire shoulder leftover, which I will happily devour over this week.  Unfortunately, I don't have a pic of the pork after pulling, but here they are right before they came off the smoker to rest: http://i.imgur.com/EIkaT.jpg

My ribs and birds are killer but my Boston butts are missing something. I rub generously and cook at 225 for 12-18 hours. The tenderness is right, the bark tastes amazing, and the smoke ring penetrates a decent amount, but the whole inside of the roast is flavorless.

To get the bark/smoke flavors into more of the meat, I'm considering cutting my butts into 3-5 pound pieces so there's more surface area for rub and smoke penetration.

It helps you track multiple cookers and foods, cooker and food temps (as well as drawing temp graphs to see patterns), changes to the cook, cook and rest times, and you can post photos throughout the cook as well as of the end product. It also includes KCBS-style competition scoring for your cooks, and integrated discussion and social media so you can get feedback, suggestions and more.

We built this for the BBQ community, so it is completely free to use. Check out my recent sample cook at http://www.bbqpad.com/4/ to see how I used it to smoke a brisket - because we want the community to find this useful, we are really open to ideas and suggestions for improvements and refinements so it is as awesome as possible.

So naturally, i Google [Simply Marvelous](http://simplymarvelousbbq.com/) and end up on their site.   I eventually find the [RUBS](https://www.bigpoppasmokers.com/store/rubs?manufacturer=314) i'm looking for and notice that a lot of the rubs have dried fruits and even pecan meal in the pecan rub and even some dried honey powder.

I've used apple chips you can find in the produce section, ground in coffee grinder and didn't really notice the flavor.  That was a long time ago and will revisit it as i have some frozen.. also have some sun-dried frozen tomatoes I may grind up and throw in a rub.   

Questions....Who uses dried fruit powders, nut meals, dried honey, dried veggies, etc?   

How do you go about obtaining these ingredients?   

Anyone tried dehydrating at home?

Purchased a 12 lbs Picnic Pork Shoulder with bone in, Had the nice man at the butcher shop remove the bone

Soaked the shoulder in a gallon of water with a cup of salt and brown sugar added for 15 hours

Took the shoulder out, patted it down with paper towels

Placed it on a half cook sheet and left it in the bottom of the frig for 2 day

Took out the shoulder applied a layer of spicy mustard then add coating of dry rub, (Cumin, paprika, garlic powder, dried onion, ginger, ground black pepper, and something else I am forgetting)

Lit up the grill, held temperature at, or as close to 250 as I could for 6 hours, occasionally applying apple cider in spayed form to the shoulder.

At about the 6 hour mark I wrapped the shoulder in aluminum foil. Placed back on the grill

Placed chicken on a wire stand to hold up right

Continued the temperature at  about 250 until the chicken temperature reached 170.
