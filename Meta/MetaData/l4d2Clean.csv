Kicking and insulting only discourages new people from playing and the pool of possible matches and players will grow smaller and smaller over time.

I'm still obsessed with Left 4 Dead 2 and I'll still attempt to get games together via the two l4d2 steam groups associated with this subreddit every now and then.  Join the [reddit versus group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/rl4d2vs), which is where most of the action happens.  

The server listed in the sidebar is still going to be there for a while; it's rented for another three months; feel free to use it if I'm not doing so myself.  The mumble server is owned by null_vector and hopefully it isn't going anywhere; I and others that met through these events are there pretty often, stop in and say hi some time.

And that's it.  Huge thanks to Jerameme, Maurice Moss, Vectorious, and sweet_nightmares for helping organize these events, and thanks to null_vector, gulliver.bear, Hoopersonic, and felix_the_cat for regularly joining in so often.  This little experiment in social media/gaming community building would've been impossible for me to keep going if it weren't for you guys. 

This post probably isn't necessary and might get buried, but I wouldn't feel right just disappearing after being involved in this for so long.  Thought I'd share one more wall of text. :D

If you ever get a chance, definitely visit the city. It's beautiful, full of personality (and personalities), and has enough to keep you constantly busy for days.

I like to pass the time by setting myself difficult challenges in L4D2 and producing recordings of my successful attempts at them. So far, I've managed to beat The Parish on Expert without any teammates and without killing a single Infected along the way, and have managed to beat the first chapter of Hard Rain on Expert without any teammates and with only 1 point of health from beginning to safe room.

Here are the links to these videos, respectively:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYVHcqwk8kc

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8a6o-QX0kaw

I'm happy to answer any questions you have concerning these challenge runs, as well as happy to receive suggestions for other challenges to attempt. I always do my best to show that cheats are not being used, however let me know if you do not consider my offering of proof to be substantial with your given reason and I'll see what I can do about it. I'm currently working on a solo run of Questionable Ethics on Expert.

Thanks for watching and I hope you enjoy."	t5_2qzox	True

We previously held weekly Reddit games, but due to a lack of willing participants, it came to a halt. But now that there is a large group of new players, I decided to start [Reddit Left 4 School](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/left4school), so these new players can have some good practice in versus.

We will have games a few times per week (more or less, depending on the interest), and hopefully teach newer players how to play! The versus mode in this game is incredibly deep and complex, which can make it hard for newer players to get into. Usually newer players will just join a public server, get stomped, and then be done with the game, so I just wanted to give them an environment where they can play with and against similarly skilled players, and actually learn how to play the game.

Please add [myself](http://steamcommunity.com/id/wek/) or any other admin of the [Reddit Left 4 School group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/left4school) for an invitation, so we can get this started. Once we get a few members, we will start playing some games! :)

I started playing today to switch it up from TF2 which has an amazing community and am greeted by one of the worst online experiences of my life. Even if someone on your team makes a terrible mistake and gets charged back into the safe room don't you think it's a better idea to tell him what not to do in the future rather than call him a niggerdick? Now I know I'm going to get a lot of ""mad cuz badz lulz"" in here but being totally honest I'm not that bad. I see a lot of players better than me but I'm no where near the bottom of the totem pole. It usually takes an hour to matchmake into a game that is full and not modded but even then there's no balance feature so one team just rolls the other until they all quit.

From my composting and VFX background it would make sense that you could only illuminate something like that easily from your own POV using some kind of normal mapping trick (or something like that). But every single time me and the team hunker down in a dark room and I have to reload I wish that I could see their flashlights too. Not being able to see anything infront of you is really annoying while your reloading. I often look straight down so that my flash light (which is illuminating upwards) is aiming right at the entrance of the door/hall whatever so I know if a zombie has broken through the line.

* Subreddit Bar has been changed to black with green text

* Snoo has been changed to a generic zombie while we wait on a newer one

* Subreddit name has changed from text to the l4d2 logo

* Subreddit header now is dark with concept art from l4d2. Search bar now in header to save space in the sidebar.

* Sidebar reskinned and reworked to have a consistent style ( rounded divs with uppercase headers).

* Footer changed to be dark with more concept art from l4d2.

* User Flair Added! Currently have special infected, survivors, and steam/xbox logos (the platform flair can be edited!).

___

Now, some things that I tried NOT to change were anything related to actual content. Links are still blue &amp; purple, the main background is white, and it still feels like reddit.

Also, I'll be poking my head around here as well, and I am open to any suggestions about the subreddit in general. I want to hear from you guys. I want to make this a bit more active (but not -too- big!).

Here are some things that I have been thinking about:

* Start up a ""Valve"" Subreddit network, where we link to other valve game subreddits (tf2 and portal), so that way we can get a few more subscribers

* Add comment icons for portraits and stuff. You know, for fun!

* Modify the comment section to add greater visual difference in longer comment threads.

* Change the header or footer to some artwork of the Survivors

* Modify the ""Submit a Link"" Button to be more eye-catching

* Add a defined rules hover-effect to the ""Submit a Link"" Button (look at /r/letsplayLoL)

* Get weekly/daily discussions about maps, weapons, si, and other stuff like that going.

We all blocked him but he managed to find a way into our steam community groups chat.

Our group is rarely big enough to play friends only matches, but when we play as a group of 3 or 4 its a stack/pub-stomp and only last 1 or 2 levels. So it seems we end up dealing with foul people every time.

People who join, suicide, then leave. Who accuse others of hacking. Who call ""RAGE"" every time someone leaves. Who blame the server for every failure. Who swap while people are still loading in, resulting in the affected player getting kicked by the swappers team.

**Or you can start a vs lobby, and instead of choosing official dedicated, choose steam group and select it.**

**It should show up in your server list on the side. Awesome. **

It is an 8 player VS server ready for you to use.

It has one mod so far, which allows you to be the only player in the server so you can wait for others to join.

Let me know if you have any problems, if I need to ban someone, suggestions for mods to run, ideas for game modes, etc etc.

Currently you have to select ""Change Mutation"" and then choose the mutation you want, say ""Versus Survival"", and then it will only show you games for VS Survival, which is of course always zero.  They all are.  Because nobody can get any players for these games which are hidden in an obscure menu, nobody joins them.

**I'm fairly certain that if players could view a menu of all mutations currently being played at one time, people would play the ""other"" mutations a lot more.**


This seems like such an insanely easy fix that has literally no downside.  Also I know about the command ""openserverbrowser"" but that doesn't really help here, because as far as I know, there is no way to know if the server is hosting a mutation, only which map is being played.

The server is in Chicago; hopefully everyone in the continental United States and most of Canada gets playable pings.  It currently has 18 slots, 8 player slots and 10 for spectators if anyone wants to watch a game in progress.

**To use the server, you have a few options:**

* Join the [/rl4d2vs](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/rl4d2vs) group and it'll show up on your Group Server list within L4D2; just select ""Group Server"" when you're creating a lobby and then Reddit L4D2 Server from the list.

* If you're not in the /rl4d2vs group: before you launch your lobby type or c/p this in your console:

    mm_dedicated_force_servers 216.52.148.229:27015 (US)

* Just join from your main menu if you are in the /rl4d2vs steam group and you see a game happening or just want to sit on the server by yourself; I won't judge you, I promise.



----------------------------

The following configurations are available in addition to default confogl.  

* promod - [Pro Mod 2.6](http://www.l4dnation.com/confogl-and-other-configs/pro-mod-2-6/)
* promodhr - Pro Mod with Hunting Rifle
* pm1v1 - Pro Mod 1v1
* pm2v2 - Pro Mod 2v2
* pm3v3 - Pro Mod 3v3
* hunters - Pro Mod 4v4 Hunters Only
* hunters3v3 - Hunters 3v3
* hunters2v2 - Hunters 2v2
* jockeys - Pro Mod 4v4 Jockeys Only
* retro - Pro Mod Retro (basically L4D1 rules, quad caps possible!)

To use a config, you must currently be in vanilla versus; best way to guarantee this is to start a versus lobby with your fellow players and then join the server.  One player from both team simply types !match once the game is loaded, followed by the name of the configuration.. examples...       

* !match promodhr
* !match (without a config name will load default confogl, which is quite outdated at this point but still available)
* !match jockeys (for the lulz.)

...one player on both teams has to type the !match command to get the game going.  The map will then reload.

It would likely be a 4v4 VS server located in the center of the US for the most even pings for the largest number of people (if you put it on the east or west coast half the people will get 110ms pings, but if you put it in Dallas for instance the worst case is 55ms which is playable for all) with numerous plugins for democratic voting on maps.

I would also likely make a map-pack for quick download of the custom maps that will be on the server as well. If enough people think they would join in, I'm willing to give it a try. Any ideas or suggestions are welcome, including telling me not to bother.

Any plugins or mods would be good to suggest as well, as it would be ""our"" server, to do what we want with. Do you like crawl mods? The ones that make the levels longer and harder (They block the short routes and force the long ones) etc.

1374344124.0	1ipffi	L4D2 Xbox 360 Servers = Garbage	PeakTemper	20	4	11	"I have been playing L4D2 since it first came out, back then the servers were fantastic.

As soon as the Passing DLC was released, the servers have gone to crap. 
It started off slow, first with lag on the official servers, then the disconnecting of players mid game. It ended up straightening it self out for a while, at least until The Sacrifice came out, then it went crappy again. And the same thing happened again when Cold Stream was released.

Through thick and thin, I have been with this game, community and friends, but the servers recently are just down right awful.
There are several threats when coming into an official dedicated or local server game, these being:


-- Valved (This completely resets the game, taking you back to the Intro etc)


--  Instant Finale (The rescue vehicle appears instantly, this happens across every campaign frequently)


--  Random Server Shutdowns (Self explanatory)


--  Ghost Infected Grab (A person in ghost mode will grab a survivor, with the Charger pounding animation, only way to fix is if the ghost leaves game or an actual Charger frees the survivor)

These are just a few examples of what can ruin a game, considering how small the community is now.

The official servers are so bad (consistent, 4 step lag), that me and friends have been hosting on Local servers for the past 2 months now. And you know, if the host gets Valved, then the whole game is returned to lobby.

I am expecting replies like ""That's why you should get a PC, bruh!"". Honestly, if I could of, I would of. Could being past tense, I couldn't afford a computer to run L4D2, so I got a 360 instead.
But that is where I met my best friends, and I couldn't imagine playing the game without them honestly.

With the recent news of Microsoft dropping the fees for developers to update/fix their games through the 360, I don't see any reason why we can't get some support here with these servers.


TL;DR - The servers are shit, love the game, had to vent.

Charger = Boris?

Spitter = Not sure on this one.  (Jane?)

Smoker = Popeye? Woodhouse?

Hunter = Kreiger?  

Jockey = Pirate King?  Intern Danny?  (Again, not real sure the best choice.)

I've played maybe 5 games of vanilla versus since RV came out and have been disappointed by every one, in fact the last game I played was a parish were each survivor team literally finished every level until the last one where it came down to the tank on the bridge (where we finally won).  It was the longest most frustrating match to play as infected.

1376478649.0	1kcb0y	What's the worst Versus match you've been in?	Returips	19	4	33	"Me and a friend of mine had a bit of a surprise last night. I've probably played in much worse but we were playing No Mercy and everything was going great.

Our team mates had mics, we were fast, didn't leave anybody behind and dealt with commons and special infected pretty swiftly. 
Things started going bad around the 3rd chapter (as infected) when our team mates started calling us noobs and all that jazz, because neither of us had over 1000 hours played on the game.

According to these two players, if you don't have 1000 hours on the game, you're not good enough to play Versus. 
So as you'd expect we started losing. I sat in silence as my friend debated with them about how we should ""go back to playing Tetris"" 

So after hearing them argue and argue for what seemed like an eternity; I left. 
I never usually rage quit from matches. Since, in my opinion, only a real bad/""noob"" player will leave when things are going bad. 

I've met a lot of cool people while playing this game. Whenever one of our team mates makes a mistake, I just tell them to relax and don't sweat it. My friend does the same. Maybe we're just too friendly, but we can't stand yelling at other players for making mistakes. 

Maybe it's not the *worst* match I've been in, but arguing with your team mates can really cost you the game. Especially rage quitting. 
Perhaps this would have been better off on the L4D2 discussion forum on Steam, but if you've ever been in a bad Versus match, I'd like to hear it. 

Edit: I have almost 300 hours played of L4D2. I pre-ordered the game right from the beginning.

My favourite so far is Holdout, which is a survival style custom mutation where you hold out against waves of zombies, build barricades, and collect loot from special infected to purchase supplies.

There are so many differing game types that there is almost certainly something for everyone, and with the option of being able to make your own custom mutations being added later, you could always design your own.

The only down side that I can see to this is that the number of game modes being added may split the community slightly and make it a little harder to find a random game, but the number of options for game modes that you can have now means the game has much more appeal, especially for playing with friends.

I just started playing vs after quite a bit of experience on coop. I am terrible! Getting kicked a lot for failing (esp at tank), but the problem is there's really no way to learn these things except for by trying.

Also, a lot of the teams I end up on don't seem to communicate at all... I guess everyone assumes that I will know what to do?

I tried looking online for tutorials and such, but most of them seem to be about game mechanic and not strategy...

1339127810.0	ur187	Honestly speaking, This is my favorite game ever that I have the hardest and shittiest times playing	BesomeGames	20	4	8	"Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2 have to be one of my favorite games of all time. It (and TF2) can be credit for the 150+ Steam games I now own. I started playing on the Xbox 360 and switched to PC gaming after hearing about the improved graphics and online community. I not only own two copies of both Left 4 Dead games but I have also purchased four gift copies of the bundle for friends. I have spent hundreds of hours playing across both systems, I have recruited friends by giving them the game to have team mates, I have posted on Reddit, GameFAQs, and the Steam forums which got me over fifty friends on Steam. In all the effort I put into enjoying this game when it comes to versus I start to get really upset. I would have to say there is probably a 0.1% chance I will successfully end a versus games. For me, there are two major problems.  
  
**1. Time Commitment**
*This first complaint is mostly a personal issue and I don't blame the game*
A personal issue for me is being a cigarette smoker. If I am playing a game and my heart is racing I am going to want a cigarette more then anything after a few heart pounding rounds. It's practically impossible to get seven other people to wait three minutes for me to afk half way through a game. I don't smoke inside and I game upstairs. I wish each chapter was considered a game itself but still back to back, if not then at least an intermission with a vote to continue. I think those that drink and play can at least agree on that.  
  
I rarely finish a game with all the players I start with. For most games I play online it is quite different. It seems expected to me that I will not necessarily finish with the people I start with. I don't know if other people share the same opinion, but it's definitely not all vote kicks. A full game of versus is a campaign twice and can sometimes take over an hour. In this day and age I can't play any game for an hour straight without interruption. Bathroom breaks, spouse, children, phone calls, pets and life's random acts make it almost impossible to dedicate uninterrupted time for anyone that doesn't live at their parent's house unemployed. I am not trying to insult anyone I am just trying to state that I would think for anyone in a relationship, who has a job where they can be reached at anytime or live with people get interrupted a lot during a day. committing with seven other people for over an hour is hard in a day and age where a game of Call of Duty is less then ten minutes at a time. I stand firm about chapters as games themselves, with the whole campaign as a tournament. That way you would still get a sense of accomplishment and/or closure while still getting a sense of victory for the overall experience. Either that, or implement some sort of intermission.  
  
**2. The Community**
At this point I have already come to terms with the fact that I'm either going to make an elaborate excuse for an afk break or quit the game early. So I've given in to the cold reality and decided to play anyway. It's Russian Roulette trying public matches. Out of all of the post attempts to find like minded players I have amassed over fifty friends on Steam. I know three of them in real life, the rest requested me after reading a post looking for teammates. On average I have no more then three people online at a time playing Left 4 Dead 2. When they are on and I request to play I never get a reply. Not only did these people specifically request to be on my friends list in order to play, they also choose to ignore any attempt to join them in a game. At this point I have basically given up on any attempt at organized play. Not only is it hard enough to find enough people at a time, it's hard to keep anyone together long enough. This reduces me to public matches.  
  
Some of the most ignorant, rude, annoying and down right rotten people I have ever met online, I have met through Left 4 Dead 2. Tonight alone I was kicked for not speaking another language, spawning as a special infected someone else wanted, scoring too much, scoring too little, and twice I have no idea nobody said or did anything. Out of the eight matches I attempted tonight I finished none. I was kicked from six. Six games. It is almost impossible to please anyone. Recently I have been kicked for only having 70 hours on my playtime, even though I have over 100 on the Xbox 360 version. I attempt to talk on my microphone and I'm lucky to find anyone else that does. On the occasions that I do have teammates with mics we don't talk outside of introductions. Out of the hundreds of games I have started only a small hand few have I ever been able to use real teamwork and coordination. Those few games are the reason I play. The rush I get from thinking about it is indescribable. Knowing that I not only met random strangers over the internet, but we worked together like trained mercenaries. Warning each other, calling off plays, and best of all coordinating strikes. It is so fucking rewarding it ends up being the only reason I still attempt to play. I am basically an addict, addicted to that rush I had about three times I played.  
  
**The bitter truth**
Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2 are some of the most fun experiences I have had playing. It's not that often a game will come around so much I want to buy it for other people. It's like trying to play Goldeneye 64 back in the day if you were snowed in. There is nothing more frustrating then the time I waste trying to enjoy something. The worst part is that I know where it comes from. Valve is basically know for their kick ass games and support. It's unfortunate that Team Fortress 2 can get so much focus but there is no signs of improvement over the versus modes of this series. The Official Left 4 Dead 2 forums is littered with posts just like this, at least I can know I am not alone. There is no particular reason behind this post, I just wanted to rant. After wasted three hours of my time trying to enjoy something I love I just wanted to rant.

So I started this project when i was on TAFE(college) holidays, and now that tafe and work have all gone back, it's come to a bit of a standstill. It would probably take me at least another year to finish it by myself at this rate. So I'm handing it over to the rest of you. No pressure though. Figure out who wants to do what. Feel free to cross post this to other l4d2 forums and sites.

Here is a 300mb zip with all the DC maps in a full resolution PNG format. Someone wanted TARGA files, but they were like 1gb each. I've also included the autoexec.cfg file i use. And instructions and notes. Now it's easier than ever!

In return, I made a $10 donation to [Every Smile Matters](http://www.everysmilematters.com.au), a charity started by a young Australian boy to help out sufferers of Noma disease in Africa. 

Here is [proof](http://imgur.com/a/WOKPk) of my donation. Thanks again to the person who gifted to me!!

**Perhaps if there are any other Aussies (or Germans?) out there that want the uncensored version you could post your steam ID in this thread and see if anyone else wants to help you out in return for a donation to charity. L4D2 is 75% off on Steam at the moment, so even if you make a $10 donation you are still getting it for half price. Everyone wins!**



I live in Australia, and thanks to our draconian classification laws we can only get the censored version of L4D2. I was hoping someone might be able to help me out by gifting the US version of the game to me via Steam. It is currently on sale for $4.99.

If you send me an uncensored Steam version of the game, I will do one of the following:

* Make a **$10US** donation online to the charity of your choice
* Pay $4.99 to your Paypal account
* Gift you reddit gold in return

If anyone can help out, please let me know! I'd be happy to post proof of the donation. My username on steam is the same as reddit. Thanks!

As I have continued playing, I have been very frustrated by certain bugs which have no seeming resolution.

For example:

-Players getting swapped to opposite teams during a VS. match when the server changes level

-Dying in the no mercy elevator, sometimes without healing.

-Silent Jockeys

-Spitter damages. Desired behaviour : the longer you stay in spit, the longer you're hurt. Real behaviour : the longer the spit is on groud, the more it hurts.

-invisible charger glitch


j-okey over charger : when attacks occur both at the same time on the same surv, jokey will be carried by charger


-boomer can still vomit after a bunt (spam the button, it'll work), spitter can't.


-burning witch attacks the first survivor who will hit her after she was set on fire

-Finale glitches, no horde/ends straight away.

-Today I joined a game where only Team A was allowed to play map 1.  After that the game progressed to map 2 and was normal from that point on.  Team B never got to play map 1.

1364189103.0	1ayiy0	Help playing Splitscreen on L4D2 (PC)	Holographic01	14	3	2	"Hello awesome people of Reddit.
I need your guys' help on playing splitscreen on the pc version of l4d2. So far, I can play splitscreen on the same monitor and play using two PS3 controllers connected via bluetooth on any original campaign included within l4d2. My question is how do I play custom campaigns from the wworkshop and l4d2maps on splitscreen? I've seen so many posts on forums saying you just type in the custom campaign map on the console for l4d but that does not work for me. Is it even possible? Whenever i try using the splitscreen cmd + map name it always starts with only one player on the screen, no splitscreen. Does anyone know if its possible to play ss on custom campaigns and if it is, how?"	t5_2qzox	True

TO ENLIST FOR THIS LEFT FOR DEAD MAPPING TEAM

This is an opportunity for you and the L4D community to come together in the fight against the green flu. Infection outbreaks have been reported across the nation, cities are swarming with the virus, teeming with the soulless husks of former people. Will you hold your quarter?

**Project Name:** The Exodus

Brief Synopsis: Before the (L4D2) survivors arrive at The Vannah hotel, they have met each other at an abandoned farm ranch just inside the supposed exclusion zone where CEDA has told civilians to move inside. As they try to find rescue, they realise that the situation is much more desperate than it first seemed. Neighbourhood after neighbourhood has been overrun by the infection. Will they make it into the 'safe zone' and get to the Hotel for the final helicopter evac in time?

**Layout:**I planned for 5, but the is only the basic paths built on 4, so that would be our first decision as a team. Do we cut out the fifth map and stick the ending on Map 4, or do we make it the full monty?

**HOW YOU CAN HELP:**

Urgently required team members

* Level Designers (Preferably two, but not restrictive, mainly for fleshing out the maps)

* Sound Engineers (Sound Effects)

* Scorer/Composer (For the musical jingles)

* Artist (For the campaign poster/ in-game textures IF POSSIBLE)

* Voice Actors (For the conversations we had planned for the maps!)

* Senior Level Designer (For detailing, nav meshes, and the difficult stuff)

**CURRENT MEMBERS**

Head of Project is [Avenger](http://steamcommunity.com/id/theoneavenger/)/bingblondie
who's basically done everything so far, but doesn't have the time to continue all by himself.

Assistant Director is [FOUND](http://steamcommunity.com/id/FOPX/), who was a general advisor and level design superman, but once again time limitations mean that he's unable to regularly provide feedback.

Then there's me! I'm basically the go-between from the community and the dev-team. [Raptoxr](http://steamcommunity.com/id/raptoxr/). I help with concepts and ideas, but have no hard input on the actual maps themselves. I rarely use Steam, but am constantly on Reddit!

**PLEASE NOTE**: Community input is taken on board, and actively encouraged! Want to see a scene in the maps, like a zombie stuck on a lamppost? ASK FOR IT! We want this to be the best project ever, with ideas being forwarded by you guys! In addition to this, another Assistant Director can be appointed if any of you are enthusiastic enough to do it! We just need a bit of your time and brainpower :)

It's a bit hard to express this, but, inevitably, this project will die without the community's support. I beg of you, don't let this amazing concept fall off your radar! We have a strict timeframe on this (want it out by the end of Summer at the latest), as Avy is moving on to pastures new, and I myself will be heading off to uni. If it's not done by September, I think it'd be best left on the scrapheap - just joking, we'd open source it and let people cannibalise our work to make new maps!

I played on xbox for a couple years and switched over to PC in 2011. I immediately was drawn into the whole idea of ""confogl"". It interested me that the modding community was working on making the changes that they thought were for the best as far as balance goes. To skip a bunch of filler info, I ended up picking up metafogl development in January 2012, and shortly after decided to make my own config ""Pro Mod"". It was named after the old cod / counterstrike competitive configs which I used to play.

Recently we were able to get some better statistics with a stat tracker that was added to the config and we realized that people were wiping on average 75% of the time (99% on finales). It was then that I realized for too long we thought that making the game harder was balancing it. Lately I have been working with some other developers on making the config more balanced for all levels of play and wondered what stops you from playing? Was it the community? The config being too hard / elitist? Or was it something else? I'm here to try to work with you guys to make something we can all enjoy. I will answer any questions."	t5_2qzox	True

After subscribing to and waiting to download new Steam Workshop content, I booted up L4D2 and noticed that only about half the items where there.  

Finding it odd, I decided to restart the game.  After doing this, all the add ons had to redownload.  Confused and thought I did something wrong, I verified my game cache, same result.  

Reinstalled the game (authoring tools and dedicated server included), same result.  

I currently logged a ticket with Valve and am awaiting a reply, but maybe it is a surprisingly simple fix.

While I can just unsubscribe from all the add-ons, it seems a bit counter productive since the game, while fun, is supposed to have this feature now and it seemed to work better when you just manually put vpks in.

This is particularly annoying because I get chosen as tank fairly often. Like I said, usually I have a decent enough score that I'm one of the top two players in my team, but then I start as a tank, and it's like n00b time all over again.

For example, I land about 50% of the punches I throw when playing tank. Usually it looks to me like I am close enough for the punch to connect but then I miss. Sometimes I'm simply chasing a survivor who is running in a straight line and I can never catch up to them. However, when I'm playing survivor and I'm running away from it, I get nailed constantly. What gives?

If anyone has any tips or links to places where I can learn to be a better tank I'd appreciate it! I think most of all I need more practice, so is there a way that I can practice playing tank on my own?"	t5_2qzox	True

""Oh,"" you think, ""after killing hundreds of common infected, hunters, tanks, and witches, this is how it ends""
_____________________________________
TL;DR I think it would be interesting (and more difficult) with common infected children in the game that are short enough that they aren't visible when looking straight ahead.
________________
Edit: To appease those that would be critical of Valve producing a game that involves killing children (even though they are infected), Valve would simply add an Achievement:

My friend &amp; I started playing through the first couple of campaigns on normal &amp; started to feel like we weren't being challenged enough. So we decided to jump straight to Expert &amp; we seemed to be doing pretty well until Hard Rain chapter 2 Saw Mill.

The furthest we've gotten is to that building with the elevator where you press the button &amp; need to survive a wave. We've rarely gotten that far &amp; when we do, everyone's either dead or close to dying so we don't stand a chance against the wave.

Every other time, we just keep dying to stupid shit. Since everything's random, things can turn to shit in a split second. Needless to say, we're very frustrated. We even got a full team of 4 recently because the other two computer team members are completely retarded &amp; don't  do shit &amp; we still can't beat this fucking level.

Everything worked perfectly yesterday up until the point that I disconnected my computer to blow all of the dust out of the case and fans with a can of compressed air. After reconnecting my computer, I could not establish a connection to any games. 

Any lobby or game I attempt to join it just says, ""Establishing connection to game....3 games remaining, 2 remaining... etc."" eventually it just puts me into a lobby of my own that none of my friends can connect to. My internet works fine otherwise. I can connect to multiple websites, I'm getting a 12Mb + connection. 

Nothing has changed with my system settings, I have even completed a system restore back to a previous date where the game worked fine. I have also checked all my cable settings and reseated my RAM and video card.

Also, other games will not connect as well. For example, Battlefield 3 will not connect either. I know this is not a game you can assist with but I am just using it to give you more information about my issue. 

Voice communication programs such as Teamspeak and Ventrillo work fine as well. I can connect and communicate perfectly. It seems as though the only issue is with connecting to online games. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I've had this problem for a few months now and finally decided to ask on here.  I can't seem to find any answers online either.  My first thought was that the FOV was low but it's set at 90.

The only thing I can think that might have changed it was that I tried to setup split screen so that my gf and I could use K/M with a controller but I thought I deleted all the files and changed back the config.

I was just wondering what weapons people pick up based on difficulties...particularly melee weapons. When do you use melee weapons? When are melee weapons a terrible idea?

I purchased the games quite a long time ago, and enjoyed them a lot. I went to play today and for some odd reason, the heart pounding drum music that is supposed to play during a panic event (when tons of infected start charging you out of nowhere) will not play.

I have tried the ""Verify integrity of game cache"" option through Steam on both games, and each time it says 1 file was missing (I believe this is normal). In-game, I have used the console commands ""snd_rebuildaudiocache"" and the ""snd_rebuildlocalizedaudiocache"" options. When I get into a game and check the console during a panic event, there were no errors despite the music missing. The only thing I seen was ""cant call getguidforlastsoundemitted from server"" two or three times. I tried posting this problem on the official forums but it wasn't any help. Also turned Music Volume all the way up just to be sure to cover my bases.

Another strange thing I should mention is, I have to run the games through the .exes. When I try through Steam, it says ""This game is currently unavailable."" I am not sure if this matters.

Does anyone have a clue why this is happening or how to fix it?

After weeks of playing with randoms we found a regular player, which is great. He's a bro and we love playing together, but bots and randoms suck. We want a fourth to share in our adventures.

With the school year starting, our playtime is more limited. We're looking for a fourth person available every Friday and Saturday evening to play with us regularly. I'm sure you're thinking, ""Why not play public?"" Because randoms suck, that's why. Most of them don't use mics, half of them are not team players, and the rest are 11 year olds. And the one's that *are* good are condescending jerks. We want real players.

I don't want this to feel like a friendship application or something, but honestly, we don't wanna waste our time, so here's what we're looking for.

* A 17-25-ish year old player.

* Available Friday and Saturday evenings to play extensively with us.

* A decent player. Seriously, as long as you don't suck, we're good; we play for fun.

* Someone who *loves* co-op campaign. That's all we play together. We go through the entire game in order on Normal and repeat, and it's actually an incredible way to unwind and have fun. We're hoping to up the difficulty once we get good, but that may be awhile after we get a fourth person.

* **ALL DLC IS A MUST.**

* **A MIC IS A MUST.**

If you think you wanna play with us, lemme know. **My gamertag is Magik Waffle.** We just love this game and the cooperative aspect of it and just want another buddy to game with us on a regular basis.

1330952632.0	qiib5	Custom Campaign Night Week 6 - Haunted Forest! | March 5 @ 7:30 EST	daveyeah	10	2	4	"Custom Campaign night turns six weeks old with a campaign that has received the Valve stamp of approval: 

[Haunted Forest!](http://www.l4dmaps.com/details.php?file=6923) ([How to install custom campaigns](http://www.l4d.com/blog/post.php?id=4771))

Because it was a featured custom campaign, there should be no problem with finding official servers to play on to get these games going.  That said, the official unofficial reddit server does have the campaign on it for the  versus game.

Stop on in to the reddit l4d2 chat room ([direct link to chat](steam://friends/joinchat/103582791431039414)) to find three other players to play with at 7:30.

Sadly, there is only room for 8 players in the post-coop versus game (two slots are available for spectating the game if that's your thing), so it's a first come first serve basis as far as that game goes.  No hard feelings I hope.

See you tonight!"	t5_2qzox	True
1329508273.0	pua8t	L4D2 update released! Be sure to download before tonight's game!	Jerameme	13	2	17	"Updates to Left 4 Dead 2 have been released. The updates will be applied automatically when your Steam client is restarted. The major changes include:


**General:**
-Fixed missing steam avatars in transition panel.

-*Witches on fire will now continue to attack instead of sometimes flailing around aimlessly.*

-*When infected players slash at a jockeyed survivor, all damage will be applied to the survivor and not the jockey.*

-Added some missing music files for the L4D1 campaigns.



**Crash Course 1:**

-Rescue closet doors that are blocked in versus are now inaccessible to both teams.

-Fixed the area portals near the howitzer event. Players should now be able to see through the infected-broken holes in the walls properly.



**Crash Course 2:**

-Rescue closet doors that are blocked in versus are now inaccessible to both teams.

-Removed a bad item cluster in the finale which was causing too many items to spawn.



**Dead Air 3:**

-Fixed an AI bot pathing issue with climbing the fence leading into the construction yard.

-Removed the ability to climb an electric box prop near the barricade in the construction yard. It should no longer be possible to skip the barricade event.

-Added an infected ladder to some pipes on the far side of the barricade to create a route for player infected on that side to easily enter the construction yard.



**Blood Harvest 4:**

-Widened the gap in the railing on the final bridge.

-Falling off the cliff or the final bridge is now fatal to both teams.



**Blood Harvest 5:**

-Fixed a potential bug for low-end machines where certain walls and textures near the starting safe room would vanish in certain views.



**Cold Stream 1:**

-There is now only a single hunting rifle in the cabin after the rope bridge.



**Cold Stream 2:**

-Moved the magnum near the start of the map, nearer to the other tier 2 weapons.

-Tier 2 weapons near the start of the map are no longer single-spawn.

-Adjusted cars and road props to reduce the chances of players getting caught on geometry.

-New infected ladders added.

-Added a weapon spawn in the tent on the barrel explosion bridge.

-Fixed an exploit that allowed survivors to climb the tent on the bridge to skip the barrel explosion event.

-Added an M60 under the barrel explosion bridge.

-There are now slightly more infected coming at slightly faster intervals during the end-level onslaught.

-Fixed a bug where players and infected could get caught in the geometry along the walls in the tunnel leading to the stairwell during the onslaught.

-Several minor visual tweaks and bug fixes for performance throughout the map.

-Added wrong-way signs to indicate when infected players have reached the end of the playable parts of the map.

-Fixed several spots where players and AI could get stuck.



**Cold Stream 3:**

-Added a new, much more obvious path across the tanker explosion gap.

-Tweaked the wooden catwalk area following the tanker explosion to make it easier for survivor and infected AI, as well as infected players, to navigate.

-The water now has a new texture effect which will work on low end machines.



**Cold Stream 4:**

-Fixed a melee weapon that liked to spawn inside of a table near the start of the map.

-Fixed a case where AI infected would sometimes get stuck trying to mount the drain to climb up toward the start of the map.

-Consolidated items in the tank fight area at the halfway point.

-Altered tank fight area in the stream so that AI tanks don’t spawn in nearly useless/sitting duck locations.
-Removed one of the triage tents and replaced it with an open trash/storage area.

-Added a pair new routes up the final tower for infected players to reduce AI common infected collision and pathing issues, and to give infected players more strategic options.

-Several prop adjustments for players using low-end settings.

-Added wrong-way signs to indicate when infected players have reached the end of the playable parts of the map."	t5_2qzox	True

**How to install custom maps:**

1. Unzip the archive (obviously)
2. Copy the .VPK file
3. Navigate to C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\left 4 dead 2\left4dead2\addons (yup, that's a lot of clicking)
4. Paste! And that's it!

*Note: you cannot simply install by double-clicking the .VPK; this can cause errors as Steam's auto-extraction is flawed. You have to install manually for it to work!*

You can verify that it's installed by going to the main menu in game, clicking on ""extras"" and then ""addons."" All your custom maps should be listed there.

My in-game name is Ashlou[RS]. Look forward to seeing you all there! :) And if you can... please RSVP on this thread."	t5_2qzox	True

For those of you who are on the east coast, our next LAN will be in August and will be LANFest Sponsored By Intel. Check it out [here](https://lanfest.intel.com/events/fites-2013/main). The L4D2 Scavenge tournament is always the most intense (IMHO) and my favorite.

We are attempting to reach out to other gaming communities in order to build up our own by running game nights. We will be having our next FITES game night this Friday (6/21). The games we will be focusing on are DOTA 2, L4D2 and KF. We filled up our FITES Teamspeak server during the last game night and had a lot of fun with Planetside 2. Hopefully, we can make that happen again. Our TS info can be found on our [homepage](http://www.fites.net/index.php). Hop on in this Friday starting around 8:30 PM EST and play some L4D2 with some friendly people for a few hours. All skill levels are more than welcome. Maps, Game types, etc...can be decided upon in TS. We hope to see you there!

I did it once when L4D2 was new, but I don't remember how I got it to even work in-game nor how I compiled and all.


**Edit**

What I've done so far is decompile both models with mdldecompiler (with hooch fix) and then used guistudioMDL to recompile the world model, but I can't seem to be able to fix the view model (it doesn't show up, i've just changed the model smd to load and commented out hitboxes so far just to test). I'm compiling with TF2 gameconfig which might be why it doesn't work properly.

1358747675.0	16z3m1	"Does anyone else play ""Last Man on Earth"" or ""Lone Gunman"" mutators?"	xx2Hardxx	8	0	2	"I personally think they're an amazingly fun twist to the base gameplay, especially when I don't feel like using teamwork and just want to be a zombie ass-kicking machine. I also love the challenge of playing it on expert just because I can. 

For those who do not know, both mutators are single-player. ""Last Man On Earth"" removes all common, and the player must complete the campaign versus specials and boss only. Player may be incapped once and is automatically revived, but is black and white and must heal. All throwables become molotovs and any weapon can be found.

""Lone Gunman"" removes all special except Boomer and boss. Player must navigate campaign using only a magnum pistol, as no weapons are available. Throwables may still be picked up. On Expert difficulty, one hit from any infected incaps the player, forcing the player to restart the chapter. (Not sure about on easier difficulties; I only play it on Expert)

Both of these mutators offer good fun and good challenge, and they also help train you to be a much better L4D2 player. LMoE, for example, helps develop player-vs-special skills, as well as strategies for facing/strategically evading specials. It will also help train headshots, as you will need to earn quick kills on that surprise hunter or the sneaky smoker, etc. LG helps teach the player to check corners and minimize damage since it leaves no room for error. Since any scratch can incap a player, they must be defensive- but not slow- the AI director is picky and is likely to spawn a horde if the player is not moving fast enough. This forces the player to develop mobilization strategies, deciding when to hole up and defend, and when to dash towards to finish.

Just remember that while these mutators are fun, they will not turn you into an unstoppable L4D2 player- you will still need teamwork to survive no matter how good of a shot you are."	t5_2qzox	True

Suck? =/.	sushislushie	11	3	14	"Some of my friends recently purchased the game when it was on sale solely because they knew I played it so damn much and wanted to join me. However, one guy in particular is a cocky prick who thinks he's amazing and always wants to jump into versus with me without ever having played the campaigns. He thinks L4D2 is ""so easy"" and involves ""no strategy"" because all you do is spray shoot or melee spam.  

I really can't stand campaigns so I won't play those with him, and I can't stand his attitude in versus/scavenge. He'll join into a game I'm already playing, including really even matches where it's loads of fun playing a close game, and then fuck everything up with his cocky asshatness.  

Am I being rude in saying ""Play the game on your own til you're semi-decent and then I'll play with you""? I know we were all noobs at some point, but I learned how to play without having someone hold my hand... he can do that too, right?  

Also I've tried pointing him at the group here specifically for teaching new players how to play versus. He refuses. He says it's no fun playing without me. But I find no fun in playing with him. I feel bad that he's wasting his money if I'm not playing with him but gah I can't stomach it.

Later, I was re-playing Half-Life 2, and I noticed how perfect many of the animations would be: people fleeing from a building into the streets, a couple trying to console each other in a safe room, etc.

At the time I was a Spitter I believe, I was chasing the Survivors outside of the tall building with the death charge spot right beside the elevator.  The survivors were moving towards the big fuel tanks you can climb up.  I'm not exactly sure what happened, but I was down at the bottom of the ladder, about to climb up to get into position to spit on our Charger, when suddenly my Spitter simply vanished, and in it's place one of the Survivors was being ground pounded--by an invisible Charger right at the base of the ladder.

Now I don't know where the Charger charged from, whether he was on top of the tank and charged off and it glitched him *inside* the tank, or if he charged from behind and something just messed up, but it was really weird.  The other Survivors also had a hard time getting him free, they were firing at him but it seemed to take a long time for them to finally kill the invisible infected.

Anyone run into this before?  The only other glitch I've ever really run across in this game was a Tank somehow turning into a Spitter that couldn't move or attack--but I think that had something to do with the player leaving right when it was his turn to take the Tank."	t5_2qzox	True

1297460984.0	fjpx0	Question about a mod		10	2	5	"So I have been playing l4d2 since March '10... Occasionally I will join random games and get a modded server... About four or five months ago I joined one of these modded servers running dead center and played an amazingly odd versus game. OK enough back story, onto the description:

It started out with infected team spawning only as chargers with 1hp every 3 seconds... If you hit with the charge you would do the normal smash and pound, but if you missed you would die.

Next round it was only hunters with &lt;100 health every 3 seconds.  Quite fun i must say.

The following round it was all spitters with fast spawn... with double spit and after spit immunity.  

After that it was the strangest finale I have ever seen.  Upon reaching the atrium I noticed there were cans already by the car and no infected to be seen.  We get into the elevator and it begins taking us down.  When we reach the bottom floor we are greeted by a fresh Jimmy Gibbs Jr. zombie that will not die.  A message sprawls across the screen that says ""Jimmy Gibbs is stealing your ride!""  Oddly enough this is exactly what he does... Gets in the car and drives it off the platform, fishtailing into the elevator and breaking the glass before speeding out the doorway.  

At this point I am like wow that was fucked up, this dude just stole our ride and almost hit us.  That thought was quickly driven out of my mind by the six tanks that rounded the corner and promptly killed us all. 

Also, there was a train that kept coming through certain parts of each map with a message in green that said ""Chicago Ted is escaping"" (or something to that effect).  since those two rounds I have never come across this mod again, nor can I find it at any of the l4d mod sites.  

I want this mod and have a server to load it onto for hours of enjoyment.  I was hoping someone on here would know something about it but if not oh well, feel free to add [me](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198021617943) on steam, I will play any mode and not yell at or try to kick someone who is new.

Currently I'm meeting people from Europe, and I really don't mean to be racist, but most of these Russians I meet are ruining my gameplay. Most of them have a terrible attitude toward online co-op gaming. Now, I don't know if it's like this in every region but I feel like when I'm grouped with Russians, 90% of the time it either ends with me being votekicked or continously killed by them. The second they find out that I don't speak russian they turn against me. You might think the reason is that I'm a terrible player but I'm not, really (I've been playing FPS games for atleast 10 years now). 

I say again: Please don't take this as racism. I've got nothing against them in general, just the attitude of most of the Russians I meet in L4D2.

1366301708.0	1cm2ue	Feedback on my server concept please	hugo_montenegro	7	0	3	"I recently started a L4D2 coop server and I am having a blast running it. One unexpected benefit of having a server is getting to hear what different players like and dislike about the game.  I have emphasized the aspects of L4D2 I enjoy most on my server, but I'd like get some more feedback on whether or not people would enjoy playing on this style of server.  I'd also like to know if there are any changes or additions interested parties would make.

Now I know that some people, for myriad reasons, do not like to play on modded servers.  I respect that.  But before I begin, I want to politely request that anyone who wants to express their dislike of modded servers in general simply refrain from responding.  It's an interesting debate, but not what I'd like to focus on here.  Thanks.

OK, on to the good stuff!

The goal of my server is to increase the challenge of advanced coop in a manner that encourages constant teamwork and clear communication, and forces a group to have an evolving strategy throughout an entire campaign.  These are the aspects of the L4D series that make the game more than just another FPS for me.  I like to think that my server accentuates the need for all three.

Here is a breakdown of the server setup:

* No Tier 2 weapons spawn
* No melee weapons spawn
* Tier 1 weapons usually spawn at level start and a few other places but not always
* All Tier 2 weapons have 2/3 normal ammo capacity
* No throwables spawn
* No Medkits spawn in the saferoom or finales
* Any item can be purchased (even those that don't spawn), players start with 7 points

Points Awarded:

Heal or defib teammate: +5, Revive teammate +3, Protect Teammate +2 (Does not always proc, seems to be about 40% of the time)
Kill witch +4 (one player), Kill tank +2 (All Players), Kill SI +1
Kill 25 regular infected +2, 20 headshots +4

Cost:

Military Sniper -14, AK/M16/SG552 -12, SCAR -10, Spas/Auto -10

Health kit -20, Defib -15, Pills/Adrenaline -10, Ammo -8

* Any item can be dropped with a chat command
* Any item except weapons can be shoved to a teammate like pills
* The witch is slightly more sensitive and causes automatic b+w
* Friendly fire is reflected to attacker, however, FF can cause incap if health of victim is at 5 or below.
* The saferoom door can only be unlocked by one randomly chosen survivor each round.

As you an imagine tough decisions need to be made when purchasing health items.  Getting a tier 2 is a game changer, but if done too early and at the expense of keeping some teammates in the green, a multi-SI or tank attack can lead to a swift end of round.  If there is a restart, your weapons and items go back to where they were at start of round, but the points you spent do not come back.

Long periods are spent with low health as pills must be saved for when a tank comes, and healing must be done in a way that takes advantage of every bit of hp you have.  This heightens the tension and makes holding a tier 2 weapon, or the ability to move at normal speed feel like a true blessing.  I for one love this tension.  One random player said the pace and tension actually felt like a suspenseful movie XD.

All of the planning and points accumulation comes together at the finale.  Because their are no health kits, the quality of the team play will determine how doable the finale is.  If you planned for tanks and events with throwables and heals, and if you minimized the hp lost during SI attacks, an on-point team will usually finish with all survivors.  If points were wasted and teamwork was poor, the finale can be come a struggle that is, at times unwinnable.

This far more challenging than a vanilla coop game, but with good teammates and a plan, it often does not feel that way.  You have to be smarter with your resources, but I have found so far that a good team always has enough for events and finales.  When you have bad teammates, however, you realllllly feel it.  Accept in very specific conditions, winning teams *never* heal themselves on my server, and the coordination of when to purchase health vs defib takes a vocal team.

What I've arrived at then is not something equivalent to the challenge of Expert, but an Advanced+ mode that, in my opinion, limits the impact that a single dominant player can have on a team, and requires all team members to play an active roll.

So... for those of you who like modded servers, does this appeal to you at all?  If not, what sort of modifications do you prefer and why?  If you are into this, what would make it better or more interesting?

Cheers,

A last little note... I have found that with pubs the server causes a bit too many rage quits, and is better suited to very skilled random players, or a group that is already familiar with each other.  For this reason, I made an easier version of the server where points accumulate quickly, and some of the challenges are reduced or removed (health kits, for instance, do spawn at finales in this mode).  If you happen onto my server and it is in easy mode, my apologies.  Send me a message on Steam and we'll set up a game XD"	t5_2qzox	True

I've noticed a increase of players lately due to the sale, and would like to give you some friendly advice for how to deal with the vs portion of L4D, especially if its your first time. Let's get started!

Survivors: This is the easiest part! If you've played a fps game before you already know the basics, so it's easy to adjust. I'll number these tips for ease of readability.

1. Get a mic if possible. This helps so much with the teamwork aspect of the game. If you can't get a mic, make sure you stick close to the survivors and are a quick typer. If you must type don't unless your are being attacked by a special or are in a place where everyone is going to stay put for a min. Nothing is worse then having a player get attacked because he was just standing in the middle of a hot zone where infected are known to attack. 

2. Let people know you are new. People are bound to be more patient, and they will probably show you a couple of tricks as well. 

3. Stay close to the survivors. Don't go off shopping for items by yourself. Don't lead, but don't be the last one. 

3. Use your items wisely. Pipes are for when you are all in danger of going down or a tank is attacking and you've been boomed, not for clearing a room. Mollys should be saved for a tank, unless others instruct you otherwise. If you find a Molly, let a more experienced player know, so that you aren't the reason your team loses to the tank. No one likes that. Shots aren't for health use unless nessicary, usually they are used if you have to get some one up in a hurry.

That's about if for the survivors. Your probably like, duh! That's okay, the real reason I'm creating this guide is for the...

Infected advice. This is without a doubt the hardest part of versus to get used too. Here's what I got for you.

1. Attack as a group. If you've got a spawn ready, wait for everyone to get ready before you attack. Attacking by yourself is generally useless, unless there's a guy waaayyy of by himself. Then it is acceptable.

2. Learn to respawn. If you spawned and the survivors some how got away don't fret. Run backwards, away from the survivors. This will allow you to respawn. This doesn't work on every level, but it works on most. The key is to run towards the starting safe room.

And here I'll do s general guide to how to effectively attack its specials.

Boomer: The backbone to any good attack. The key is to blind as many survivors as possible so that the high damage infected (i.e. charger and hunter) can do as much damage as possible. You'll want to go in before them. Your stumble from being shot is also useful around ledges and spit.

Hunter: Pounce when you know that you have the best chance of staying on the longest. After a boomer, while another survivor is biding pulled away, just time it right. 

Smoker: Pull survivors over edges when ever possible. That is the most useful you can be. Also when you know the survivors are about to drop down a hole as a group, try to grab the last one. Just make sure not to spawn to early. They will hear you, hunt you down, and gut you.

Charger: You have the unique ability to kill any survivor if you charge the off an edge. Make sure you have a smoker or a jockey set you up, it will make it easier. You also have a very high damage punch. If you fail a charge, make sure you come out punching. 

Spitter: The second utility special. Your job is to wait until a hunter or charger nails someone, and then spit ASAP. Try to work your fellow specials to get them in a tight hallway or room for maximum damage.

Jockey: Similar to the smoker, you have the ability to force survivors off of ledges. You can also grab those who are way behind or way ahead and separate them further. While the charger and hunter are getting major damage, you grab a survivor and take them as far away as you can.

The witch: You cannot control the witch. But you can help her out. If you see survivors nearing, use your jockey or smoker to force contact. Hunters are useful for witches as well, as when the witch is scratched near a survivor, she gets extremely mad extremely fast. 

The Tank: If you don't feel like your up to the damage, stay put and wait for the tank to pass. It will after a certain amount of time of not attacking. If you do decide to attack, wait for a boomer. It makes the attack so much more successful. Watch out for mollies, and keep note of which survivors have them. 

Sorry if this seems a bit short or I left out anything, I'm typing on my iPad, and its a little harder to do a long post. Let me know what you think."	t5_2qzox	True
1357015860.0	15rcn8	Customizing Your Crosshair: Are there better ways to go about it? (Information and questions)	RaisinsAndSquid	8	0	0	"(I apologize if this is laid out and done terribly, I'm rather new to reddit and this subreddit)  

As a former Counter Strike player, I'm a believer in crosshair style/size/color affecting aim and precision.   

I've noticed L4D2 has a severe lack in crosshair customization. 
I'm well aware of the standard console commands (for the few unaware):  


    cl_crosshair_green (0-255)

    cl_crosshair_red (0-255)

    cl_crosshair_blue (0-255)

    cl_crosshair_thickness (1-5)

    cl_crosshair_alpha (0-255)

    cl_crosshair_dynamic (0-1)



But these are hardly aqeduate for my needs. I was wondering if there are any decent ways to alter the crosshair to a greater extent. I'm an advocate of skins/mods, and have come across these:  


[Zeon and Prodyigism's GUI/Crosshair Solution](http://zeon.prodigysim.com/gamemods/zonegui.html)


[GAMEBANNANA Upload](http://gamebanana.com/l4d2/guis/26460)  


I personally find them inadequate, as Z/P's modification has a crosshair far too large, thick, and solid, and because (for me) dots are unpleasant.  


So the question is, is there a way/modification for better, effective, aesthetically pleasing crosshair customizations?

Jd8coke	8	2	14	"So, as requested [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/l4d2/comments/13vweb/rl4d2_should_have_flair/), I have put together a set of flair images that includes the majority of weapons and characters from Left 4 Dead 1 &amp; 2.

I set up a new sub reddit to test this out first, but it should only take me a few minutes to copy things over if the community likes what they see.

If you would like to see what the current options are, please go here;

http://www.reddit.com/r/L4D2CSSTEST

And click on the ""edit"" on the right hand side just below the subscribe button.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Just a few things to remember;

 - I do plan on changing the boomer bile image to a proper bile jar. I may go in-game and get some screen shots for the bile jar/pipe bomb/molotov. But, the other weapons will be staying the same.

 - None of the images can be made much bigger in size without displacing the front page of the sub reddit. I have made them as big as I possibly can without messing it up too much. It's a fine balance, but if it makes the front page of the sub reddit look terrible there's no point in having them.

 - Please do suggest more options, but remember that the image will be fairly small so please take that into account when you comment. You can see how any of your suggestions will look by opening up MsPaint, pasting your image suggestion and shrinking them until they are 35 pixels high. (Remember to lock the ratio.)

 - ~~I'll also be adding a little Xbox and Steam logo for people who want their names in the flair. This isn't feasible to add to every picture as it requires a lot of editing code, and as you can see from the rather large selection of images, it would take incredibly long.~~ Done! You can now have either a Steam logo or an Xbox logo and put your name in there.

1332175652.0	r3n1c	/r/L4D2 Events for 3/19 - 3/22 - Also [Discussion] Time	daveyeah	8	1	23	"So, some questions for y'all.

First, is participation.  If you've never joined a [/r/l4d2](/r/l4d2) game night, why not? 

Second, is notification.  I'm considering ditching the event announcement posts altogether and putting a ""menu"" at the top of the page with names of reddit game nights and their respective days of the week, similar to [/r/music](/r/music); they could drop down with more info if need be, like the name of the current custom campaign or the mutation; thus we have an announcement of the event without having the post that feels kind of redundant sometimes; the downside being that we have nowhere to discuss the games if needed, but I guess if someone has a grievance to air or an idea, they can just start a thread.

Finally, new events: currently, as you probably know if you join in on any regular basis, there are two events every week; custom campaign night, and versus night.  Occasionally there is a beginners night when we think there is interest.  So I thought I'd throw a couple of ideas out there.

* Mutation night - this would likely happen on Friday nights, as that's when mutations change, not to much to discuss here I guess.
 
* 2v2 night - I really like 2v2 confogl, and thought it'd make an interesting event if we could figure out how to pull it off.  The way I imagine it is four players would start out on map 1, then the team with lower map score is replaced by two people out of spectators, assuming anyone is there.  I'd love for there to be an easy way to switch maps on the fly instead of relying on pre-set campaign (winner selects next map?), but I'm not sure how that would work without everyone being kicked out of the server on every map change.  

* Reddit teams - In a discussion about a game that happened on Thursday night a couple of weeks ago, team versus was brought up; Jerameme and rikonstruct both have friends they could consider a team and thought it'd be fun for redditors to gather up in set teams that play against each other.  I'm not so crazy about attempting to organize this, but if anyone wants to get into it, it'd be pretty cool; any thoughts?  This could be a one night a week thing where challenges could be announced and accepted in a thread or we could do a reddit ladder if someone wants to set it up.

The reason I bring this up is because of when I played Age of Empires 2 (very different game, but stay with me) and there were custom scenarios, you could download the scenario from the host.

Is there functionality of this in L4D2?  If not, is there a reason?  I know the files are much bigger, but I wouldn't mind waiting to transfer a few minutes if everyone saw the same mods."	t5_2qzox	True

1335936756.0	t2vdz	recount that one crazy yet perfect run where you felt shit ton of butterflies sloshing in your stomach	tj1987	8	4	13	"There were two separate runs in which I experienced a never-had-before amount of adrenaline gushing through my system.

First was Coldstream's finale, expert realism campaign run. We biled right off the bat and booked it. After we jumped off the cliff, tank showed up with his legions of undead minions. Our plan was to run around the tank instead of fighting head on. I had on me a shot, a bile, and a combat shotgun. Stabbed the lame thigh with the motherfucking shot, ran around tank and headed straight for the tunnel. Having played this game countless times, I knew very well, being separated from the pack, meant that I'd be targeted by specials and hordes from ahead. My fight or flight response quickly kicked in, and a crap ton of adrenaline was released into my system. I felt it. It was the wrath of a thousand butterflies swirling in my stomach. My muscle stabilizers went haywire, causing my hands and fingers to tremble out of fear and excitement. I did not experience time slowing down, but my sensory perception was certainly heightened - I took in a lot more details, felt more focused, my ear canals widen to listen for the specials' trademark sound. I was about to reach the stairs the lead out of the tunnel, when this horde came up, and they looked mighty quick and unforgivingly vicious. I already had bile in my hand, but I hesitated, unsure of my timing. In that 0.6 seconds before first contact, I threw that bad boy on the ground. Horde enveloped around me, but not attacking me. I was slowed, but I managed to shove them apart. I ran past the house. The butterflies in my stomach reproduced. It's now 10,000 butterflies in my stomach. I ran to the main entrance to the chopper zone, picked up another shot, jabbed it, and ran so fast I swear my pants got left behind. At this point my body was overwhelmed. It genuinely expected a fight or flight situation, but I was just sitting on my chair, neither fighting, nor flighting in their literal sense. All that extra energy from my adrenaline rush that had nowhere to go started to pent up real quick and almost knocked me out. Before I knew it, I was already on the chopper. I exhaled my first breath in 47 seconds, a period of time that felt like years. My teammates caught up, but one got caught. We bade him farewell, and rode the chopper to the setting sun.

Second run was a versus game, in the mall of Dead Center. Anyone worth their salt in versus knows the escalator in the panic event is a prime spot for concerted attacks. We hit the glass, ran out like a bunch of prisoners who just never wanted to go back to Guantanamo Bay no more, and hiked up the escalator. Alarm blaring. Specials spawning. You think a smoker pulling you off the escalator is bad news? Try tank and charger combo. Before I could calm my fucking legs to assess the situation, three out of three of my teammates went down. I had on me a combat shotgun and a moly. Nothing else. Still on second floor, I ran around the escalator, knowing the tank would come after me. I threw a moly on my legs, and the tank, which was 2 ft away from me, caught fire. At this point I was coming full circle back to the broken glass store, with the tank still hot on my heels. I saw my teammates all curled up in a bunch at the bottom of the escalator. A question briefly crossed my mind: do I rescue them, or just fuck it and book it? The answer was clear. With the tank this close behind my ass, there's no way I could help them up, even with a hundred shots stabbed into my body. I jumped onto the escalator, with only one goal in mind. Keep my distance from the flaming tank. Again, adrenaline started overcoming my mind. No logic, no reason, no strategy. Just pure caveman instinct of running and reflexively killing anything that wanted to kill me. I was on third floor now. Zombies started to pull on me. I felt like walking in a mud, with a big ass alligator closing the gap behind me. I shoved. I pushed. I blasted a few shots right in between the eyes of the undead. I broke free, but the tank was getting closer. I ran to the security room, closed the door, and deactivated the alarm. I could hear the tank breaking the door open. I did not turn around to look, for one look would probably slow me by a quarter of a second, closing the gap enough for tank to give me one tight blow to the ribs. I went out the second door, closed it, and ran. Another door. Closed it, and ran. Down the stairs, another door. Closed it, and ran. Each time I closed a door, I could hear the tank smashing through it soon after. But the gap was growing. And then, when I reached the door of the long hallway, a charger came after me. I instinctively avoided the head on charge, blasted seven shots in its general direction to make sure it died, and kept running. I looked at my HP. 65. A mixture of permanent health and temporary health. Still above 50. That meant I could still run at full speed. I ran out of the room,  up the escalator, and my ears sensed a jockey behind me. If my mind had worked, I would have thought shit I'm always weak against jockeys. I'll die. No. My mind stopped working a minute ago. My reflex had me avoided its repeated effort to ride on me, and as I did so, I blasted three shots at its head. Not pixel perfect accuracy, but enough to shut it down for good. I ran along the upper floor, saferoom door in sight. But I was still cautious. I blasted pre-emptive shots at the gaps ahead of me, to my right. A charger and a jockey had spawned earlier. So who knew, a smoker might show up next. And I was right, it did. I got into the saferoom, just as it unleased its furious tongue. I closed the door, and the tongue hit the door. Ding Ding Ding Ding Ding. I made it. Streams of chat text from the opposition team came through, cursing me, hating me, albeit in a friendly way. I still trembled from the adrenaline rush. I told myself, shit, that was one hell of a run.

TL;DR: Super heightened senses in adrenaline filled runs, surprised even myself.

*Custom Campaign Night - Week 14*

*Time* - ~ 7:30 EST

*This Week's Campaign:* [Detour Ahead](http://www.l4dmaps.com/details.php?file=4094) ([How to install custom campaigns](http://www.l4d.com/blog/post.php?id=4771))

*Who*- Contact [sweet_nightmares](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sweet_nightmares) (Ashlou[RS] on steam) for more information or to suggest a map for a future game.

*Wat*- Starting this week, we're doing things a little differently.  For the past 13 weeks we've played campaign so people could get a basic idea of a campaign's layout, and then we'd attempt to play versus.  We will now be featuring a campaign for a month; this month there has been a few games played on Detour Ahead, and so we're closing the month out with this campaign.  

We will be organizing versus right at 7:30EST, at least ""officially.""  Those of you who aren't into versus should still show up at 7:30 EST to find yourself a co-op group, of course!

*Next Month*: [I Hate Mountains 2](http://www.l4dmaps.com/details.php?file=8500)

If you're looking to play a relatively rage and asshole free game and nothing is happening at a time/day convenient to you, feel free to use the reddit groups listed in the sidebar to wrangle up a game.  It would be preferred if you could try to set balance teams for your groups as opposed to all-random, since there's generally a range of skill in most games and our experience has been that setting teams so there is some semblance of balance works best.

**Second weekly game?** 

Just throwing this out there and I'm not totally sure where to take this, but I'd like to get a second match going here.  I have a few regulars that have been joining me every week, and I don't want this to become a weekly advertisement of a match between people who already play together.

So there's a lot of different directions we can go with this, and I want to throw it to the [/r/l4d2](/r/l4d2) community to see what people want. 

*Is a second game on Thursday night at 7PM EST good?  Later?  Another night of the week?*  

*Should the lobby have set experience levels*, say Novice / Advanced or should the game be mixed skill levels with teams being set by lobby leader to attempt to balance?  

Either way, **I'll need a volunteer** to run the second game.  I'd do it myself but I don't have time to nail down two time frames every week, as much as I wish I did.  

Hopefully next week  or the week after we'll have something more concrete to set up; this week will likely be on the fly and unorganized and may not happen at all, but that's not exactly anything new for these weekly games, for anyone who's been here since the beginning :P

Last I played it on one of the first versions it was tough as nails;there's been many changes since then.  Anyone want to run through a co-op campaign before next Thursday?

**edit** great game everyone, our best yet, in spite of some issues keeping the teams full for the first map or two.  thanks for playing!  "	t5_2qzox	True

We've been having a blast just playing the offline Co-op with two computer controller survivors.  We blew through the campaigns on L4D2 on Normal and upped the difficulty to Advanced for a greater challenge.  We played through Dead Center, tougher, but nothing we couldn't handle.

We started Dark Carnival, same thing up until the Coaster...
We wiped 4 or 5 times before we called it quits for the night.  The problem seems to be our AI companions.  We start the coaster then bum rush to the other end.  The other two keep up for a little bit but always fall behind or off the track, they just can't keep up the whole time.  We don't really remember this happening on our play through on Normal.

Does anyone know of a different strategy that works when you've got two AI?  We haven't really had to babysit them at any other point.  I know the obvious answer is 'just play with a full team', but we'd rather play on our own (no pressure to do really well, just have fun).

I saw the L4D and L4D2 Steam sale this weekend ($10 for both? Dizamn, I almost HAVE to buy that) and so I went ahead and picked them both up. I have this habit with Steam games to get em and never really play them so I knew I would have to load one of them up if I was ever going to give it a shot. Herein lies my dilemma:  Which should I start with?


Is there a benefit to beginning with L4D instead of L4D2? Will L4D help me hone skills that I just can't get from the sequel? Is there must watch story lines that I need to play through both games to enjoy? I finally loaded up L4D2 and played a little bit, the story doesn't seem to be the main draw for this game, but it feels like if I jumped on a server at this point that I would just be so crappy I'd ruin it for the other 3 people playing. Also, do the DLC's add something that I need to look into or if I don't really get into the game on its own should I just skip over the DLC's? 


I wish I had more time to play video games to be honest, now that I can just get any my little heart desires I have neither the time nor energy to play through any of them. I think the only game I've actually sat and played through completely in the past 4 years is Portal. *sigh*"	t5_2qzox	True

the hardest part is that perspective warps everything. it would be easy if there was a way to set the view to an orthographic projection, but i'm pretty sure there's not.
so far my plan is to, start a game. turn off the director, remove all the infected, boot all the bots, turn off the fog, no clip, run ""exec screenshots"" to remove glows and HUD and hide the players hands. use cl_showpos to make sure my altitude stays the same. hover across the map in a grid like fashion taking load of screenshots. then run the screenshots into a panorama photostitching program to merge them. manually touch things up in photoshop if i need to.

some of the maps with multiple layers of indoors areas will be difficult, but i'll figure that out later.

let me know if anyone has any tips or advice.

1332227558.0	r4sm1	Helping my friend with his 10v10 server.		8	5	10	"I'll give some back story for context. We used to have a HL2:DM server a few years ago, he had a decent little community going along with it. Well now we play L4D2, and he got tired of the obligatory kick, or griefing every time we played. Not to mention we live in FL, and the closest viable 10v10 server was in Canada. The last time I played there it was fun, until I incapped somewhere and some asshole decides to mess with me and pick me up half way and let go of use to drop me again, (he did this several times). Needless to say my jimmies were rustled, and it wasn't worth the lag, or b.s. to play there. So fast forward a few months, and I'm here with a modded, perk laden 10v10 server. We have a blast playing with just bots, but I would like to see other people enjoy it too. He made medkits, and pills cheaper. Also you start the round with points, so it's nothing to get a laser, pills, molly, before you head out. You can also self help if incapped or SI has you pinned. He can also tweak stuff as we go along, but for what we use it for, it's awesome. I know some of you may not like 10v10 servers, albeit a modded one, but I am a hardcore vanilla fanatic, and I like this. So here's the ip: 206.220.173.243:27015  We haven't got a Steam group set up yet, but he's working on that. So if you want to play on a server where there is no griefing tolerated, with some chill people, then let's play. I hope I'm allowed to plug servers here, if not sorry in advance. And thanks for any feedback or bugs you might find. We are pretty busy most of the time, so we will be seeking more admins in the future. Hopefully sooner than later. Add me on Steam if you would like. [elizabethtincher]


TL:DR: New grief free 10v10 server needs seat of the pants testing/player slots filled. 206.220.173.243:27015 The Playground. Leave feedback ITT, or message me directly.

Am I wrong about the specs? Can I do any tweaking to improve performance? I'm wondering if it's a driver issue, but I tried getting the latest from AMD already, can someone point me to better drivers? The easy auto-scanning stuff isn't helping.

I should add that I've played a bit of TF2 on it already with few problems. The performance is much better.

Anyway... I'm thinking of having a couple people over for a small doomsday party that involves split-screen zombie-killing with Wiimotes. This is based off of a weekend project I worked on last week that allows me to easily create custom functions for a Wiimote in Linux (not just standard keybindings or joystick emulation).

It won't take much work tomorrow to customize it for L4D2 (which I'll be running under wine this weekend, unfortunately), but I'm wondering how the inputs should be mapped. I wanted to see if anyone wouldn't mind providing some suggestions.

I think the nunchuck extension should be a requirement, but let me know if you think it can be done without...

Here is what I'm thinking so far. First, these are kind of what I feel like would be the obvious mappings...

nunchuck control stick = forward, backward, strafe left, strafe right

nunchuck C button = jump

nunchuck Z button = crouch

nunchuck shake = push back

wiimote B (trigger) button = shoot

wiimote shake = reload

And here is everything I'm not so sure about...

Aiming: I already have a sensor bar on top of my TV, so infrared would probably be the obvious source of input here as opposed to the accelerometer, but the issue I'm seeing with this is that the crosshairs are always at the center of the screen, and there is definitely no way to change that. So to aim, you would need to point at the target, then follow the target as it is brought to the center of the screen, and shoot when it's in the crosshairs. Sensitivity will play an important role, but let me know if you think there are other things I should consider. The thing that I'm mostly worried about is that aiming needs to just feel right...

What should be mapped to ""A"" on the wiimote? It seems like it should be something important. 

wiimote - and + buttons = scoped weapon zoom in/zoom out? Is that even an option in the input settings? I can't remember...

wiimote dpad = I'm thinking should be something involving switching between weapons, pills, and medpack/defib

wiimote buttons 1 and 2 = I'm thinking they should bring up the voice commands menu

Is there anything else I'm not considering?

Also, if cyn wins (I hope so, sorry VR) then they'll have to play another match, which they want to be Monday night EST, which, what do you know, is perfect timing for me to miss it again because 10am class at Uni.

So sad.

Anyway, in case y'all didn't know - those are the time deets as of right now. And feel free to pity me and share commiserations (or, hey, you know.... make it Sunday/Monday morning/afternoon EST instead and I'll stay awake all night to watch.)

1328886137.0	pjeoa	Any way to force certain shader effects while on medium shader detail?	Jerameme	4	2	6	"Basically, I have a GTX 460 (768mb version, yeah I know, not a particularly good card by today's standards) and when I run the game at high shaders, the framerate stays at 60 *almost* the entire time, until someone throws a molly at the horde in a busy part of the map (particularly in the L4D1 campaigns, for whatever reason), then it drops into the low 50s/ high 40s.

Being the framerate nazi that I am, I turned the shaders down to medium to ensure that I have 60 fps at even the most intense moments. However, turning shader detail to medium disables a bunch of effects (film grain, specular highlights, bloom, motion blur, etc.) all at once, some of which I'm sure my computer would be able to handle if they weren't all being rendered at once.

So, the point being, I'm wondering if there is any way to enable film grain, motion blur, or bloom separately, while still keeping the shaders on medium. Anyone know anything about this?"	t5_2qzox	True

What I would like to hear, from anyone who plays Versus competitively or semi-competitively, is your opinions on the best and worst maps or campaigns to play Versus on. 

Specifically I'm looking for what is considered fun or not fun, and balanced in terms of win ratio. Like, if Blood Harvest stage 5 is very unbalanced because Survivors win 90% of the time they play that particular map due to its huge, open exterior area. 

Also if you know of any links to outside threads that may already be discussing such topics would be appreciated. This will help me study what is good and bad for Versus before I plan anything out. Thanks :)"	t5_2qzox	True

I remember having a lot of fun times just meeting new people and doing nightly matches/fragtags/raids, but I've fallen out of contact with a majority of them as many of them now have important careers, family obligations, etc. I've actually searched quite a bit on reddit in distinct subforums for people to play with, with what little games I still have anymore, in hopes of finding new friends to game with. 

The only thing I really have is TF2 and BFBC2. During the amazing sale last December I made a sort of premature decision to buy, with what money I had, Borderlands/Bioshock 2 instead of something with a still thriving multiplayer community.

If anyone does have an extra copy of L4D2 laying around from that sale, or whenever, and needs a new person to play with who is online quite a bit and a fun/experienced mature player, it would be generously accepted. I also, when I do have the chance/funds, do pass on the karma: I recently gave a legit digital copy of Witcher 2 Enhanced which I got for free on GOG after having the standard to brightstarblack on Reddit.

It is always at the same part of the progress bar on every campaign that it crashes on.

EDIT:

I think I may have found the problem. It appears a custom glow that I had installed may have been conflicting with the consistency command on dedicated servers. This explains why it would only freeze and crash on certain maps yet let me load them at other times. The maps weren't the problem, it was the servers that were hosting them.

I'm trying to install an addon map from lfdmaps.com, particularly Dawn Before Dead (http://www.l4dmaps.com/details.php?file=7774). I download, unzip, click on the file to install. That doesn't work.

I've followed all of the install methods http://www.l4dmaps.com/install-maps.php

I thought maybe because I have steam installed on a second hard drive, that I would manually ""open with"" install using the addoninstaller on my second hard drive.

3rd, I tried placing it in the addons folder in E:\Program Files2\Steam\steamapps\common\left 4 dead 2\left4dead2\addons (my secondary HD)

None of them work. One thing I noticed is that when I try method #3, once I open up the game the .vpk file disappears from the addons folder.

It doesn't show up when I try to start a campaign with an addon or find one, and if I go to extras&gt;addons nothing appears.

I've been on l4d2maps.com and getting some of the more popular maps. I am on mumble a lot for BF:BC2 but i often find the l4d room there empty.

1307646962.0	hvr5w	For fun	peterfmutch	1	0	0	I play L4D2 vanilla, and I play for fun but I like playing with a competitive spirit too.  I'm hoping that there's a community of people on here who wants to play with someone who doesn't rage quit and takes their fun very seriously and would want to play with me! My profile name is Nucking Futs if you want to add me, the profile picture is of Gordon Freeman.  	t5_2qzox	True
1306163046.0	hi2y6	Is the L4D2 reddit community finally dead?	keke_kekobe	2	1	0	With the release of Brink subreddits and more and more redditors losing interest in the L4D2 subreddit, is it finally over?  Maybe if we created a new competitive config subreddit, one that is a bit more accessible to new redditors.	t5_2qzox	True
1303114377.0	gsm63	Please give a reason before you votekick!	boydrewboy	1	0	0	I don't consider myself a noob as I've clocked over 80 hours on L4D2, so when I get kicked, most of the time I'm absolutely clueless as to why.  Once, I got kicked within 3 minutes without any member losing more than maybe 10 health, none of which I thought was my fault.  I usually clock as low as 30 pings and I don't run ahead unless teammates just sit in the safe room for minutes on end.  In order to improve the playing environment, I submit to you that before you initiate a votekick, you explain to the player why you are doing so so that they may improve before you meet them next time.	t5_2qzox	True
