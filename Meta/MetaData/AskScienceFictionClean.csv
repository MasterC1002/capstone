Elizabethan_Insulter	718	149	859	"So I've only watched the first Matrix movie, but the characters seem to go on the basic assumption that the Matrix, the computer generated world, is inherantly ""bad"". The entire idea of the robots melting down the dead to feed other human is revolting, but if the characters never knew that, why should they have a problem with the matrix? It's with an ideal world, where the human race is garanteed continual existence and  where you are still communicating with your fellow beings. I don't get it. The matrix relies on the boundries of ""reality"", the only person who fucks it up are people like neo. The mysteries of space, the oceans, the mind can still exist.

Is there a reason why it's bad? Why must it be destroyed?

Why does it take the Enterprise crew almost half the episode to dig up information on Khan?  They know that he's from around the time period of the Eugenics War (World War III) of the 1990s.  They determine fairly quickly that he's an Augment.  They surmise that he's the leader of this group of Augments because his hypersleep pod is programmed to open first.  He introduces himself as Khan when he wakes up.  Then, all of a sudden, many hours later, after a bunch of research, they discover that he had conquered 1/4 of the Earth during the Eugenics War, and was known to rule with an iron fist.

What??  That seems like something that would resonate fairly strongly with the Enterprise crew if they know anything at all about history.  If I had come across a hypersleep pod containing Adolf Hitler, I would immediately think, ""Holy crap, it's Hitler!""  I wouldn't need to research him in the ship's computer for hours on end, wouldn't need a trained historian to figure it out, wouldn't have to be reading articles on Wikipedia all day to realize he was a brutal tyrant; and Hitler conquered far less than a quarter of the planet, during a war that was far smaller in scope than the Eugenics War.

They don't need to focus their energy on becoming invisible or anything like that, they simply become invisible. The ring does not make them more powerful in any way other than that.
So why, then, is Sauron not invisible while wearing the ring? What does the ring actually *do* for him? 

I understand that his soul and power are inside the ring, but wouldn't he and the ring be two halves of a whole? While wearing the ring, wouldn't he be only as powerful as he would be if he had never put power into the ring? And most important... *Why isn't he invisible?*"	t5_2slu2	True

1373143488.0	1hrlin	[General] If the earth was flat and infinite, how far would human beings have reached by now?	PTTGx2	113	10	50	"Imagine that the earth had the same basic shape and surface environment, but that for whatever reason, there was effectively infinite surface area. Maybe there's a line through the center of the pacific ocean which connects to a contiguous segment of earthlike terrain on an alien world or alternate universe. For whatever reason, you can go as far east, or as far south, as you care to. (Addendum: this infinite surface has ""latitude"", so although you can go infinitely far south, sooner or later you're going to freeze.)

This new terrain is 70% ocean, has its own endemic life, and most likely grows more alien as the effective geographical isolation makes new world locations more isolated from the earth we know; the terrain follows the same geological rules as known earth, but the continents are different.

This infinite earth also saw anatomically modern humans appear in Africa about 200,000 years ago.

So there's the situation. How far would humans have reached by the modern day? Would modern technology contribute much to this, or would thousands of years of wandering mean there's always some cavemen out there who never stopped walking?

Bonus points: How far has _life itself_ managed to spread from its beginning to the modern day? Assuming, that is, that it didn't arise in several locations on this infinite planet...

1362601424.0	19snwa	[MODPOST] The Fourth Wall and You	creepig	115	20	67	"We've had quite an influx of new readers from crossposting recently.  Welcome to all of our new posters.  It's always nice to see a community grow.  That said, it's time to address a problem that has been growing with our community.

The purpose of this subreddit is to answer peoples questions from an in-universe perspective.  The TV Tropes concept is [Watsonian vs Doylist perspectives.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist)  We want to see the former.

The rule is in the sidebar: Please don't break the fourth wall.  It breaks the immersion and it kills some of the creativity.  The whole point of the subreddit is to be creative and amusing.  Have fun with your explanation.  Go to absurd lengths.    One line answers are silly.  Explain more than that.

**Q**: Isn't removing fourth wall-breaking comments the job of the mods?    
**A**:  That's not what we're here for.  /u/avsa, /u/mack2028, and I are here to prevent things from getting out of hand and to maintain order, not to police comments.  We all have busy lives, and we simply don't have time to read every thread.  We clear out the report queue, and we might green post at someone who is a persistent offender, but we simply cannot be the guardians of the fourth wall.

**Q**: So who is the guardian of the fourth wall?    
**A**: You guys are!  You have the more powerful tool after all: karma.  Downvote posts that break the fourth wall, or aren't in the spirit of the subreddit, and upvote posts that are awesome.  Trust me, because I know this from experience, community involvement works a lot better than the Modstapo.

**Q**: What if a question can't be answered without breaking the fourth wall?    
**A**: Then think harder! Come up with a creative answer.  The best example is a post from a while back, regarding the most universally reviled Voyager episode ever.  Rather than say ""Because the writers sucked,"" the person answered as a Q, and informed the poster that the referenced incident had been ""erased from the timeline"", and that they were ""not to bring up incidents that have been settled by the Continuum.""  THAT is a good post.

**Q**: What if I *have* to break the fourth wall deeper in the comment tree, to answer something?    
**A**: Then say something.  Simply say ""Stepping outside of the fourth wall here"", or use italics.  There is also an OOC tag that isn't used much anymore, but if people are interested in it, I'll dust it off and bring it back.    
However, *please* be restrained with conversations outside the fourth wall.  Reddit has better places to talk about the writing of your favorite series.  This place is for talking about it like it's real.

Live Long and May The Force Be With You

Edit: To answer an excellent question by /u/NicholasCajun

**Q**: If we're not allowed to break the fourth wall, does that mean we have to roleplay being a starfleet officer or some other such thing?    
**A**: No, it doesn't.  In fact, the roleplaying often clutters up someone's post and makes it look like they had a good answer when their answer was actually pretty shitty.  The point is to not talk about *our world*.  Talk about theirs as if it's the real one, but don't act as if you're part of it.  Try to be more like an encyclopedia writer in their world.

Since this answer seems to be confusing, let's look at it this way:  [Memory Alpha](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Portal:Main)'s in-universe articles vs [my old stomping grounds long ago](http://www.fdtf.org/).  We want to see the former here, not the latter."	t5_2slu2	True

We_Are_Legion	76	12	52	"EDIT: pardon my english if its wrong. its not my first language. and i dont mean to be contentional, i loved the ME games(my username comes from Sovereign). just a bit of discussion.

In Mass Effect where in just 25 years, humanity, a race of about 11.5 billion outstrips or equals the other races in influence, innovation, technology, industry, military presence, TERRITORY(we own a quarter of the galaxy?) that have been out there for thousands of years with a combined population in the trillions. The human centrism for no explained reason is really off putting.

It really lends truth to the ingame xenophobic human movements, which the game then blatantly rails against. The rest of the galaxy MUST most definitely be inferior and retarded in comparison to humanity. Why do Asari with centuries of experience seem emotionally and mentally as mature as humans in their 20s or 30s? Asari like that face such job competition that some end up as bartenders and lowly mercenaries, its quite strange that humans compete with minds like that with little to no effort? Why has there been such technological stagnation in a galaxy of such advanced civilizations for so long? Shouldn't growth be exponentially increasing?

If today, Earth was united under a UN-like body and somebody bombed it and assassinated the united government, than the various nations would not accept dictation or equal status with Ethiopia or Pakistan had it intervened and saved(or not saved) the security council and the majority of the capital united city. They would most likely splinter if worst came to worst.

 In the first mass effect, it was well within limits and believable. By 3, this combined with so. many. other. things. just made me put the game down. This is only slightly made ok by the reaper's weird fetish for humans which meant this absurd cop-out is at least referred to."	t5_2slu2	True

We've seen it's not particularly difficult to install holoprojectors all over a ship. We've seen that it's trivial to create effectively superhuman holograms:

* Geordi created at least two with the full intellectual power of the ship's computer (the Brahms and Moriarty programs)
* Data created a Borg drone with strength that exceeded his own vastly amplified strength
* We know that the holographic systems can create any variety of lethal weapons, from hand held to projectile to energy

Why not create the equivalent of an ""ESH"" -- an Emergency Security Hologram? Your ship gets boarded? Activate it, and every deck gets flooded with 6 foot 4 inch storm troopers with full Starfleet security training, a variety of hand held and ranged weapons and training to match, every form of martial arts you can dump into them, personal forcefields, enhanced strength and speed, and to boot, have the ship jut recycle one if it ""dies"".

Oh, what's that? Twenty armed Remans just beamed onto deck twelve? Swell. They're surrounded by a hundred Worfs with the strength and speed of data combined with Borg forcefields.

1345495195.0	yjiyg	Could the Empire from Star Wars survive in the Star Trek galaxy?	plucas1	70	7	136	"Let's say we take away the Federation and instead transpose every single inhabited star system from Star Wars at the height of the Empire (circa *The Empire Strikes Back*) onto the Federations's Milky Way galaxy post-Voyager.  They have their standard technology (including the hyperdrive) and the Force intact.  

I ask this because the Star Trek galaxy as presented across all the series seems insanely dangerous and hostile.  For all their super-tech, the Federation and its political peers are at the *low end* of the technological food chain there.  The Empire will have to face down races like the Organians, the Q, the Borg, the Dominion, etc.  Even the 'standard' races like the Klingons and the Romulans have technologies like teleportation, replication, FTL missiles, and time travel that would make them quite fearsome against the Empire's forces, even with the Empire's initial advantage of their hyperdrive.

And that's not even taking into account the sheer weirdness of the ST galaxy.  Space anomalies and galactic energy barriers and solar-system-sized ameobas...

Can the Empire survive as a coherent entity against the Star Trek galaxy?

EDIT:  This is NOT the Empire vs Federation, as some are falsely assuming.  The Federation is out of the picture here.  This is the Empire trying to deal with an inherently hostile galaxy with new threats the like of which its never faced before.

For example, The Borg have a transport system (the warp conduits) on par with Star Wars' hyperdrive as far as range and travel time.  So from the start the Empire has a potential foe for whom their one great technical advantage, the hyperdrive, doesn't really mean that much. And the Borg are unlike anything in their home galaxy.  How does the Empire handle them?

And what of the Borg's primary foes, Species 8472 and their planet-cracking bioships?  Could a SSD take them on?

What happens if they piss off an ancient super-race like the Organians?  Or the Metrons?  Or the Excalbians?  The Empire is not the peace-loving Federation, and will definitely make quite a different impression on these potential foes they can't beat by fighting.  How would they handle them?

Instead of spending millions of billions on the Jaeger Program, and then again on an ineffective wall, wouldn't it have been simpler to just send every nuclear submarine to patrol around the rift and nuke the beasts as soon as they appeared, in what would have been the largest wack-a-mole game ever devised ? 

There would have been multiple advantages :

- The Kaiju would have been attacked at their most vulnerable moment, when they just enter our dimension. None of their abilities would have been effective, any attack on the nuclear missiles would just have caused an untimely explosion of the nuclear device.

- Instead of guarding every coastal city around the Pacific, a simple underwater base designed to refuel the submarines would have cost much less to build and maintain. 

- This strategy would be meant to directly deal with the Kaiju, knowing that any attack on the rift is ineffective. However, this refueling base could have evolved into an advanced laboratory, designed to study the rift from the front line, in order to find a way to close it (it could then have been done sooner).

- Until the Cat.5 Kaiju appeared, none could survive a nuclear blast. Nuclear submarines weren't even necessary, a HUGE tripwire device connected to a nuclear missile would have been enough. Plus, it would have let atomic countries seal a denuclearization pact where every old missile from the cold war would have been sent to the Pacific Rim. Two birds, one stone. Making the world a safer place, one fried Kaiju at a time.

Although we don't see them, the tools used to make the munitions are almost certainly right there. They may not be trained in the exact sciences of how to use those tools, but I think that there are many examples (the relative ease with which they got the water off Kimiko for instance) that prove that the engineers of the Galactica, along with whatever aid they might get from other remaining scientists and engineers, are capable of some pretty awesome feats of engineering. I think it is safe to assume that they would be more than capable of operating whatever machines were at the Anchorage.

In addition, Ragnar is well known to produce a specific type of radiation that is very harmful to Cylons. It's by no means an instant kill but it was enough of a deterrent for the Cylons to choose to station their fleet outside and wait, rather than go in. The fact that the Cylon called Leoben still tried to kill Adama while suffering from the effects of the radiation is not necessarily proof that the radiation's effects are weak either. In fact it is the opposite; the Leoben model (also known as Number Two), is known to be capable of a superhuman strength that surpasses that of the other humanoid Cylons. If he had been at full strength he almost certainly would have killed Adama. This suggests that the effects of the radiation actually may be fairly powerful, especially on weaker models.

I admit the odds of winning the war against the Cylons aren't great, but if you wanted a place to wage a war from I think this would be it.

1346625959.0	z91c9	Why don't we just have synthetics work with the xenos?		64	9	10	"Hey guys, it's Sunny.

For those of you who don't know me, I'm a researcher/historian on the Yutani side of the house. You all have at least Tangerine Elephant security clearance, so I'm not worried about leaks. Just make sure that you do a hard erase on your machine after reading this.

So, I've been digging through the history of our interaction with the xenomorphs. We haven't seemed to learn from our previous mistakes; all due respect to our colleagues. Here's a break down of our interaction and how events were set into motion. As I write this, please remember that I'm a library archivist and anthropologist by training, not a biologist.

* USCSS Nostromo - This is one of the first encounters our race had with the xenomorph. Earlier encounters are recorded, but this one is most relevant. Why would we send in a transport crew with millions of dollars worth of equipment on a trip to a hostile alien world? Who deactivated the Three Laws in the synthetic's programming?

* USS Sulaco - This can be explained by Carter Burke, who compromised several security protocols. The resulting loss of life and destruction of the terraforming station can be blamed pretty much on Carter Burke. This, of course, also lead to the inclusion of Lt. William Gorman, who made several tactical errors throughout the mission.

* USM Auriga - This is probably the worst handling of xenos I have found yet. The medical crew gathers specimens and houses them together. The eventual break out is completely mishandled; there is absolutely no contingency plan for eventual escape and the crew is under-armed. This is worse because it was an event handled by the United Systems Military. Again, I'm not a ship designer, but if you're going to house creatures with highly corrosive acidic blood together, why not surround their cages with molten lead or position them over the reactor heat bleeder?

* [LV 1201](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_versus_Predator_2) - The Company initially started out using synths when working with the xenos: **Encrypted Comm Traffic** *Listen Harrison. I'm sending you down the old synthetic access system. It dates from the first studies, before the Hive learned to tear the synths to pieces.* So, why did we stop using synths? Sure, combat androids are expensive, but the loss of billions of dollars of technology surely outweighs that cost. Why not have synths involved in every stage of xeno handling? You could fly the hosts down a few dozen at a time and have the synths handle, grow and freeze the xenos after they burst. This way, if there **is** an outbreak, you have a controlled number of xenos to subdue instead of an ever growing force that outnumbers you at every turn.

* [USS Marlow](http://www.sega.com/avp/us/) - More of the same. A number of combat androids are included in this encounter, but not enough to have a significant impact on the xeno threat. We had humans handling the chestbursters, why would we make that mistake given every encounter we've had with them before? And we didn't shield the security systems from EM radiation? I'm starting to see a trend here.

So, I'm not a biologist or an economist; please explain to me why we don't just have synths handle everything involved in any mission revolving around xenos?

-Even when that required doing things they didn't understand or weren't okay with.

-Willing to do whatever was asked of them, even putting their lives on the line to help out Malfoy. 

These are characteristics of a Hufflepuff. Undying loyalty, willingness to serve something greater than yourself, commitment to get the job done no matter what. 

I know that they were pure bloods, came from a long line of Slytherins, and had nasty ideas about blood purity, but two of the most famous Slytherins (Severus Snape and Tom Riddle) were both half-bloods, and at least both of them had ambition. Crabb and Coyle have the ambition of a wet noodle on their best days. 

Does the hat really take desire into account that much? And if so, what's the point of a sentient mind-reading hat at all if every single time the kid gets to insist on a house anyway? 

(As an aside, how responsible is the Sorting Hat for allowing the sort of Slytherin collusion that led to both the rise of Tom Riddle (by giving him friends to gather power with) as well as the final corruption of Draco Malfoy and friends (by allowing him into a house that would finalize his father's dedication to the Dark Lord), both of which led indirectly to the Rise of the Dark Lord, the Occupation of Hogwarts, and the Final Battle?)"	t5_2slu2	True

I would think that the strength of the Borg Collective is that you have the processing power of millions of minds working on multiple tasks all being directed from a single source. But every time we see the Borg, they really only seem to be good at doing one thing at a time. 

In the very first encounter between the Federation and the Borg, they only do one task at a time. They send a single drone to scout the Enterprise. He barely defends himself, and when he is shot down they immedietly send another one in his place. They then begin the aim of capturing the Enterprise, but as soon as the Enterprise fights back and does some damage, they stop attacking and focus solely on repairing, even to the point of ignoring intruders from the Enterprise on board.

We see this again following the battle of Wolf 359. As soon as Picard issues the ""sleep"" command, it overrides all other commands and they stop their attack immedietly. Again during the First Contact encounter, the Borg completely ignore the Starfleet strike teams, armed to the hilt with modulating phaser rifles, until they are in a position to interfere with their current goal.

* Methods of transporting even antimatter have been known since the days of Kirk, and lower-grade explosives and weapons are routinely transported.

* Even with the supposedly big bad Borg, our ability to routinely access their vessels via transporter, even to the point of carrying out assaults and kidnapping their leader during that Locutus thing... for as adaptable and scary as the old timers say they are, I don't believe I heard they ever adapted to this.  So why didn't the Enterprise simply beam over their compliment of photon torpedoes, the antimatter storage, or even the warp core?  Or override protocols and beam matter into the enemy's antimatter storage or weapons systems?  

* If Borg can be unwillingly transported why not repel Borg (or any) invaders on a ship by simply slapping on a pattern enhancer and dematerializing?  

* Sure, most of their doings are way to classified for the clearance level of a cadet, but I heard something about one of the early enemies Voyager faced... the Kayzon or something like that?  Anyway, space-fairing race that couldn't even replicate water???  (Or even harvest hydrogen and oxygen enough to manufacture it?  Sheesh!)

Similarly, Mankind was at its technological height during the Dark Age of Technology. If I'm reading things correctly, it seems like the Fall of the Eldar and the Age of Strife both occurred nearly simultaneously. Furthermore, it would seem that these two societies co-existed for nearly 10 Millenia.

My question is, what sort of interactions did they have. If Mankind reached it's zenith in terms of technology and spread at the same time as the Eldar were the Galaxy's most powerful society, how could they have co-existed as they did? Given that the current Imperium encompasses nearly the entire galaxy, and Dark Age humanity was apparently even more widespread, I don't see how the Eldar could ALSO have been controlling most of the galaxy.

Basically, both species were at their heights at the same time, and the current Imperium is big enough to control the majority of the galaxy right now.

RuafaolGaiscioch	52	10	16	"So, both the Marvel and the DC Universes are massive clusterfucks of superheroes and supervillains.  Supervillains' plans often involve taking over the world, or inflicting mass damage, or attacking the country, or whatever.  Point is, more often than not, they are plans that would hurt large amounts of people, and it stands to reason that more heroes than just the main character of that particular issue would have the inclination to get involved.  Why doesn't that happen all the time?

I get that there are team-ups, there's the Avengers and the Justice League, but, as far as I can tell, there is still a great deal of stand-alone superheroism.  With this many superheroes, and the level of credible threat that the supervillians often pose, how can any of them justify ignoring major conflicts just so Spiderman or Superman or whatever can be the main character of the story?

I feel like I'm articulating this terribly, but the point remains.  By all logic and reason, if these heroes are as heroic as they claim to be, there's no reason that any hero should be fighting alone 90% of the time (psychological and personal fights a la Batman v.

For the simpler toys, like the army men, it's reasonably obvious - Once the toy has been cast, and the plastic cooled. But the more complex toys, such as Woody, or ones which are made of different materials, like Bo-Peep? 

Or for example, at what point would a Warhammer model become animate? The plastic parts are cast into frames, and then shipped out to the purchasers, who assemble, and then paint them. They are manufactured similarly to the Army Men, but they are not completed until they are in the player's hands.

OminousHum	53	11	20	"I have a device that can speed up my brain by any amount I wish.  It doesn't make me any smarter, it just makes the world around me seem to go slower.  It also has no effect on the rest of my body; it can still only move as fast as my muscles allow normally, so it feels quite slow when I have the device turned up to a high setting.  (It's rather disconcerting to take subjective minutes or hours to draw a breath, but one gets used to it.)

Now before I set out to find interesting and profitable uses for this device, I think it would be a good idea to consider if it could aid in my self-defense.  I am a healthy (if slightly overweight) 30-year-old man of average strength, I have never been in a fight, and I have no particular training in fighting.  With the device, my reflexes are effectively instantaneous, and I'll have as long as I wish to observe, evaluate, and consider any given situation.  But again, I can't move much faster than normal, or punch any harder than I could before.

Could I be reasonably sure of winning any given fight?  What about against someone considerably larger and stronger than me?  What about with an expert martial artist?

In these days they were just using simple copper electronics and they came up with a simple, but effective safety device to prevent fires and electrical break downs.

A piece of copper wire was suspended in the circuit, calibrated to only carry a set voltage before it would burn out and break the circuit and thus prevent damage to the rest of the system.


I bring this up as a bridge officer who has served on ships under fire.

Now, this action in itself isn't too far fetched, there was some developments in this field by some of our highly skilled scientists but it always involved a lot of machinery to read brain waves and I imagine it would take even more to change someones brain. The problem is, it has been said that second Foundation members can do this at a distance, using only the power of their own mind. Are there any prevalent theories into how they can do this? By what method are they able to implant new thoughts and emotions into a mind without mechanical aid?

There have been those that have said The Mule was able to change the emotions of entire populations and some, (who I would call crazy), even say that there is an entire planet out there full of Mules all living in mental harmony with each other.

TheChtaptiskFithp	48	8	10	"The weapons both sides use such as hovercraft and mutants seem rather ineffective. The hovercraft hover low enough and close together enough that an explosive bow with half the range of a 21th century assault rifle can take down multiple hovercrafts. This would be impossible with a WWII era bomber which is fast and high enough that this would never happen. When the rebels invade Panem, why don't they use artillery if all their low flying and slow as crap hovercraft keep getting shot down? Also they seem to rely on mutants more than on things like tanks which would be devastating to a group of rebels with rifles. 

If liquid fuel is a concern why don't they utilize tar sands or use the Fischer–Tropsch to turn coal into petrol, a military stockpile would be a wise investment, no matter how scarce oil is. 

From what I have seen, discounting nukes, a WWII army of equivalent size would easily win over a Panem or rebel army. There seems to be a serious gap between the tactics of Panem and that of the 20th and 21rst centuries. "	t5_2slu2	True

1345723996.0	yowz7	[META] Welcome new users! Here's some discussion about the subreddit rules.	avsa	47	5	34	"First of all I would like to say I'm pretty stoked we've crossed the 3000, almost 3.5k subscriber line. It seems that we've had [a few](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/ybq59/asksciencefiction_megatom0_explains_why_humans/) [submissions](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/yhvs9/could_a_1_trillion_decibel_sonic_weapon_actually/) on bestof and this gave us a lot of visibility. So a big thanks to everyone who wrote those and a big thanks to our moderator Mack2028 who has been taking care of this sub, moderating and approving posts while I was attempting to flee to the Caribbean and retire on all my karma.

This would be a great opportunity to explain some of the rules:

**It's like Ask Science, but all questions and answers are written as if you were living inside a given fictional universe**

Some people have taken issue with that, feeling it forces them to write fan fiction. This isn't the case: the idea is just to seek [Watsonian](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist) explanations for any questions, not Doylists ones. That means, answering anything with ""Because George Lucas was a bad scriptwriter"" or ""Because Star Trek had a cheap budget"" or even worse ""Because it's a made up story and it doesn't matter"" really doesn't contribute anything to the debate. Of course we know that's the reason, but can you come up with a fitting explanation?


**Feel free to cite episodes or make your own sources up**

This is intended as a ""no nerd war"" measure. If you didn't read all Harry Potter books, this doesn't make you any less capable of answering a harry potter question than JK Rowling herself. Judge answers on their own merit, not if it's against some episode.

**Take the fictional rules of the universe to their logical conclusion, ad absurdum – if your answer is more creative and makes more sense than the canon, then canon is wrong.**

Think of it as a game. OP proposes a question that was probably a plot-hole in the original series. You try to avert the plot hole just using internal logic. If someone comes up with a Doylist, real world explanation (""because it's just a book!""), he loses. If no suitable explanation can be found then the original movie/book loses and we all lose. If a suitable explanation is found we all win.


**You shouldn't usually break character, but when you do, use italics.**

This was intended as a way out of the above rules, but very few people follow it. I think it's unfortunate because sometimes when you're the only person inventing a backstory it feels silly, like coming to a costume party and no one else is dressed up. But enforcing that would be a problem with some great posts that I hadn't anticipated which are hard to answer without resorting to real life events – like crossing two different universes (Vader vs Harry Potter) and some added knowledge (""There's a great episode about this on the animated series"").

So I ask the community: What rules should be enforced more? What rules should be changed?How would you write them?


Thanks for all the questions and answers!

The newer condensed particle blaster rounds may or may not be deflected by the light-saber, depending on the charge the condensed particles carry. If so why don't the weapon manufacturers make it so that the condensed particles have a neutral charge, so the light-sabers cn't deflect them?

I thought if I managed to live to 6000, I'd have seen the whole world and learned everything and done everything I possibly can.

Elrond, though? He has one daughter, there are gaps in his knowledge that Gandalf fills and he rarely leaves Rivendell. Even 1000 years in Rivendell - watching your kin pass on to Valinor - would surely, even for an Elf, be very boring. To add to that - the poor sod has the gift of foresight! He's lived 6000 years whilst sometimes knowing what might happen before it does.

Similarly, I find it strange that at nearly 3000 years old, Arwen falls in love with a Man of Gondor (well sort of of Gondor). She's had 3000 years to mull over that kind of thing. Why then? Why at first sight? Come on, even in 3000 years...

Am I wrong to assume that Elrond and other Elves merely sit around being Elves for the many millennia of their lives, or do they sleep for long periods or... something?

There is simply something I don't understand about the lives of Elves. How can you possibly live forever? Even IF you get to meet the Valar once your work is done and chat with them for the rest of eternity, how do you deal with that? How do Elves deal with that?

Hobbits I see work. They live over a hundred years if they're healthy and they don't age as much as Men do. They can keep working well into their old age. The Dunedain? They've got plenty of things to keep them occupied. Numenor never sounded that different to The Shire anyway.

Would farmers ""train"" crops to grow on less water, or breed faster and faster horses by forcing them to run for generation after generation?

Would humans under these conditions ever need to develop technology the way we did? Or could they really on specially modified plants, animals, and humans?

Obviously this is a very broad topic, and it's impossible to say with any amount of certainty what would happen. Still, the situation interests me, and I'd be happy to hear anyone's thoughts."	t5_2slu2	True

* What is the room with the arch used for? Where does the arch go? Who was murmuring?
* What in the hell is with the brains?
* The room that is locked is the room where they study love. How do they study it? How do you get in there? Or do they not study it at all, but the door just remains locked all the time?
* How flippin big is that place?
* What's with the prophecies? How do they know they're being made? How do they know they've been fulfilled? What's the significance of keeping them in glass spheres? Seems pointless to me.

I am posting this query to the public communications forum in hope of an answer.

I am a Techpriest serving with a Space Marine chapter, The Immortal Hearts, en route to suppress an orc Waugh in a neighbouring sector, but this is irrelevant information. 

There is an irregular occurance whenever we enter the Immaterium; a fluctuation occurs in the Gellar Field and a random Space Marine vanishes into a void. Gathered data was input to a Logic Engine and it is estimated that the marines are sent to the year 2000, give or take a decade.

They are sent back without any weapons, armor, equipment or any other such gear. It is my duty to educate my companions on the dangers of such an era. I can only assume that since history does not mention any space marines coming from the future and revolutionizing society that they were quickly dispatched and made relatively little impact on history.

What should I teach them to look out for? Are their current ranged weapons a threat? Would handheld explosives like dynamite or grenades injure an unarmored Space Marine? What caliber weapons would be sufficient to harm them?

I assume their nuclear devices would suffice, as would multi ton bombs, but the more comprehensive a list I can compile the better.

-Techpriest Maldorum

EDIT: A follow up question. Battle brothers have recently been vanishing along with their weapons and armor. How will they fare? What can they withstand, and what will they fall to?

This is my first big question point. We know that BNL was not concerned with building robust, non-disposable products. So what I believe happened was that most WALL-E units failed, pretty much as designed. The remaining WALL-E that we have with us now was a combination of manufacturing and coding errors that allowed him (if I may anthropomorphize it) to survive until 2805 when the EVE unit discovers the plant. Furthermore, I believe that the original plan by BNL was to get everyone who could afford it onto an Axiom-class ship, and the ""cleanup the Earth"" project was a simple a ruse. Otherwise, why would you have simple trash compacting robots, when any number of other technologies would have been more effective (up to and including launching all the trash into the Sun.)

Despite all of that, this one WALL-E unit continued to function well beyond his designed lifetime. But the evidence from his cameras shows many things were still wrong with the Earth when EVE landed. We have evidence of massive duststorms, yet all the tracks of the WALL-E units are still visible. Even the glass doors on the BNL ultra-store are still intact. And he can be seen next to large piles of what were called ""tires"", which should start decomposing after a few decades, if not centuries. So something seems to have prevented the aging of most of the man-made objects on Earth.

Despite all the evidence against BNL, they continued the charade by sending the EVE probes to check for plantlife. But they do it by sending a small robot to scan items individually? Rather than scan for decreasing CO2 levels, temperature changes, precipitation changes, those sorts of signs, they scan for existence of individual plants. Eventually, a probe *does* pick up a plant and bring it all the way back, only to be intercepted by the autopilot via order A113.

So what was BNL's endgame? Assuming anyone onboard the ship had to sell their all their possessions to get onboard, no one had any reason to go back. However, by waiting as long as they did, in the state they did, no one who returned had any knowledge of basic construction, manufacturing, medicine, or any other crucial life skills. Who would fill that gap? BNL. Except that, again, in their incompetence, the ship's computer had gained enough knowledge to direct the people and retask the helper bots to get civilization back off the ground, without BNL's assistance.

Once we get more technologically advanced, there's already talk of going and looking for BNL's bunker, probably on the moon, to see what happened to BNL. My guess is shoddy manufacturing wiped out the lot of them."	t5_2slu2	True

After reading this thread, I started having some questions about Captain America's shield.
www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19ebp9/reddit_what_would_happen_if_wolverine_punched/

From the comic wiki:
&gt;From the wiki: The vibranium in the shield grants it unusual properties, allowing it to absorb virtually all of the kinetic impact from any blows that the shield receives without injuring Rogers in the process.

It's stated that his shield will absorb all kinetic energy directed toward the shield. This would mean he would not be able to use it as a blunt force weapon, or use it to shove people out of the way. It would mean if he threw it at someone, it would hit them and do no damage...it would simply drop to the ground. 

It would also mean that any object that hits the shield would simply impact it and fall right to the ground. 

It would therefore render this comic interaction between Wolverine and Captain America posted by /u/SunSlayer incorrect

1359483328.0	17iaby	[Gremlins] Mogwai life cycle questions	NerdErrant	39	5	14	"/r/pets sent me to you guys.

So I recently got a new exotic pet on a whim (I know, not the smartest move, but he was so adorable) from this old Chinese antique / junk dealer. He called it a ""mogwai"" and gave me a poorly translated owner's guide. Well, I'm assuming it's poorly translated, as it makes no sense. 

I've googled the term and all I get is this band with the same name, and vague references to some sort of mass hysteria in a town called Kingston Falls and that time all those animals got loose in Clamp Tower. I need help figuring out how to care for this thing, and when I went back to where I thought the shop was, I couldn't find it.

So here's what the owner's guide said:

1. Don't put it near light, especially sunlight, it can kill them.
2. Don't let it get wet with water nor give it any water to drink nor bathe it.
3. No matter how much it cries or begs, NEVER feed it after midnight.

My thoughts and questions on each:

1. I'm assuming that this is hyperbole. Are mogwai nocturnal, or do they come from a shadowy environment like a jungle floor. I could see how they could not like light, but kill them?

2. I'm not supposed to give it ANY water? I've heard of animals that get much of their water from the food they eat, but I've never heard of one where it was dangerous to give them any. I've put a bowl out where he can get to it just in case. I figure he'll know to avoid it if he needs to.

Hawk (that's his name, because he has this adorable little mohawk) is covered in a fine fur that must need constant grooming. Does he groom himself? Because otherwise, he's going to need a bath someday. Oh and since I live in the Pacific Northwest, there's a good chance he'll get wet sometime. Is there a compelling reason to avoid this, or would he just not like it?

3. Why should I not feed him after midnight? Does his digestion somehow interact with his sleep cycle in a weird way? Surely if he's starving it's better to give him something. Let me tell you this is a hungry little guy. If it is important, how much leeway is there? Could I feed him at 12:15? Then there's time zones and daylight savings time. This rule makes no sense, but it is so strongly phrased that, I have to ask.

A some final question. There was a site written by a person who lived in Kingston Falls during the hysteria, who swears by it being a real thing. In the interest of completeness, I've included his explanations. 

He said that sunlight will kill them in what he called ""violent melting"". 

He said that if they get wet, they reproduce, like a litter in a few minutes. I find this ridiculous as Hawk is obviously a mammal, as such he (she? I guess I need to take him to a vet) can't reproduce asexually. 

Finally he said that if you feed them after midnight they turn into reptilian monsters (he called them Gremlins) that almost destroyed the town. Oh and get this, the gremlins also reproduce when they get wet. 

What could the time have to do with this? How could a mammal turn into a reptile? Why would there be mogwais and gremlins when each can reproduce on its own?

I'm sorry to waste your time with that nonsense, but I'm at a loss here on what to do.

Blazenclaw	41	11	19	"I've always wanted to know if there is there any in-universe reason for why the blade of a lightsaber has mass. I always thought of it [like this excellent post by joy_indescribable](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/148s3g/star_wars_what_would_happen_if_you_stuck_a/c7b3czo), explaining a lightsaber as heating a volume of air to plasma, but this still makes the blade no heavier than air itself, essentially like a laser pointer that only extends a couple of feet.

But this obviously isn't true according to every depiction of a lightsaber duel, and how they fly when thrown- clearly they're pretty hefty and have a center of mass somewhere along the blade. If they didn't, imagine having a duel with laserpointers that could somehow stop each other, and that's clearly not what happens. So, in the SW universe now, why do epic swordfights occur?

It seems to me that the astromech droids have a very stable platform to fire from with decent and upgrade able targeting systems, watching T3 reverse up the ramp in TSL while firing makes me think there is little to throw his aim of, and the he should be even more accurate than HK because he is basically crouching while firing at all times. The one excuse I can think of is because he doesn't have fancy targeting tech, which leaves battle droids and HK with absolutely no excuse. If we assume that a humanoid design is the best weapons platform for accurate fire (which it absolutely isn't) then shouldn't droids be able to put a laser on anything as their master desires with a near 0 miss rate for non-jedi?

1362835018.0	19ywgj	[Star Trek] Why don't we have more robots?	gurlat	39	8	10	"I've been thinking about this for some time, and I really don't understand why we haven't started using more robots.

There's that one called Data that they let into Starfleet, that more than proves that the ability to manufacture and repair functioning robot bodies is well withing our reach. Sure he's a very advanced model designed and built by some eccentric genius, but the basics of working robot limbs aren't really that complicated, heck they had working robot arms nearly four centuries ago.

And it can't be lack of computer technology. We install computers on starships that have so much computing power they've been known to *accidentally* produce self aware artificial intelligence. Imagine what we could do if we were trying.. Our computers can run holodecks with thousands of fully actuated interactive characters. I'm quite certain we could build a little tin can on wheels that serves drinks, follows instructions, and does basic repair jobs around the ship. If it's safe to let a holographic doctor treat real patients, I'm  sure it would be safe to let an AI robot repair a ship. Not only would this make and engineers job safer, it would make every engineering department more efficient.

Once we had a design we could mass produce them in replicators.

It just seems like an egregious oversight on our part, we know what robots are, we most certainly have the technology to build them... but we don't... In fact not just us in the Federation, but nobody in the entire Alpha Quadrant... or the Beta Quadrant...  

EDIT: Thank you for your answers, all of you have very good points.
But I""m still a little confused, a common theme seems to be that we don't have robots because creating a semi-intelligent automated drinks trolly would be akin to slavery. 

I can understand that we in the Federation hold ourselves to a high moral standard. But I don't understand why every other race, from as far away as the Delta Quadrant holds themselves to *our* moral standards on this issue.

 * One yautja hunter with standard armament

 * One T-800 model terminator, armament must be procured in the field

THE HUNTING GROUNDS:

 * NYC, Chicago, L.A. or any city of similar size/population.

The two players must compete in the following scenarios:

 * SCENARIO A: BODYCOUNT
 * The goal is to rack up the highest number of ""honorable"" kills before being neutralized by human law enforcement/military forces.
  An ""honorable"" kill is any able-bodied human capable of fighting back (children, elderly, ill, or disabled are not counted.)

 * SCENARIO B: ASSASSINATION
 * The goal is to eliminate one Human VIP and escape the city before law enforcement/military forces mobilize a response.
  The VIP is protected at all times by a security detail of 12 armed guards (equipped with kevlar vests and submachine guns) and appropriate non-combat specialists (video surveillance, EMTs, drivers, etc.)

 * SCENARIO C: BUGHUNT
 * An Alien Queen has nested itself in the city!
  The goal is to infiltrate the Alien hive and exterminate the Queen while avoiding getting caught in the crossfire with the humans and escape.
  The city will be nuked in 24 hours.

 * Additional rules
  Killing or sabotaging the opponent is allowed, but is not the goal.

1. The innocence of Sirius Black and truth behind the betrayal and murder of James and Lily Potter.

2. The veracity of Harry Potter's claims during his 4th year of You Know Who's second rise to power and the events during the Triwizard Tournament.

3. Claims by former/renounced Death Eaters after the first and second fall of You Know Who.

Why did the suspected or disbelieved parties not volunteer or be requested to produce their memories to be examined through the Pensieve? Even if it is a unique magical artifact produced by Albus Dumbledore, there seems to be very little way to tamper with it or use it to convey false or altered memories without the alteration being obvious, and it is possible for the memories of people other than Albus Dumbledore to be shown, as demonstrated by Harry Potter's testimony of his examination of Horace Slughorn's altered memories during his 6th year. The first example above seems like it would have produced a swift acquittal for Sirius Black had he presented his memories of the Secret Keeper Binding ceremony involving Pettigrew or his confrontation with Pettigrew, and Harry Potter could easily have shown precisely what happened in the cemetery at Little Hangleton and proved the true loyalties of many supposedly ""renounced"" Death Eaters.

1362276768.0	19jzu0	[Stargate] Even if a Wraith hive ship reached Earth, would they really be able to pull off a successful invasion?	Arithmeticas	39	10	19	"Excluding any *super* Hive ships or the entire Wraith armada but say one Hive ship...perhaps even two? Would they really be able to manage a full scale invasion of Earth?

I know it's not good that the Wraith get to Earth ever but say some did. Without star ships or drone seat, wouldn't the combined traditional Earth military manage to hold them back once they realize what is going on. 

What I imagine is quite possibly the Wraith being out numbered for once, I figure in the early days of the attack the Wraith will manage to grab decent amount of humans to gobble up but long term invasion I just don't see being successful. Even if two invading Hive ships had full manned crew (which is about 10,000 last I recalled) 20,000 Wraith troops against just the US military wouldn't last very long. US has roughly over a million active troops and another million in the reserves, not to mention China with its 2 million strong army and other powers such as Russia, Britain and so on.

While the traditional Earth military's technology isn't up to snuff, the sheer number of troops could quite possibly overwhelm any ground invasion. And I imagine we see even more humans arming themselves to defend against the invaders, seeing the entire planet mobilizing into a force to fight off the Wraith where ever they may go. Sure we can't get our troops to the ships but eventually I imagine any sort of ground attacks and further cullings would start to wear down the Wraith.

I know that still, Wraith getting to Earth is bad and especially showing to the rest of the galaxy we might not be as defended as some may have thought but I figure long term, the Wraith may have to move onto other sources in the Milky Way that might be easier and that probably wouldn't sit well with the other folks in the galaxy that have nice big space ships.

Thoughts? Again, Wraith getting to Earth is bad and many people will get hurt and killed but if only a few Hive ships reach Earth would an invasion really be that successful?

Then when he knocks off Zod's helmet on earth, Zod gets he sensory overload and that hurts him, but he seems to have no trouble breathing, same with Fiora.

If powers come from the solar radiation, he should have had x-ray and super hearing when he was in the sun, not when he started breathing our atmosphere.

1.  Even though its been mentioned that they do use nuke, why they never nuked the bugs colonies from orbit using high yield nuclear bombs?

2. When the first time they are in orbit of bug planet and that bug plasma caused them a lot of trouble, why again they made this same mistake when in orbit again? 

3. Because of point one, I see no reason for ground forces to even land. (I know they are looking for mind, but you dont need mind if you are just going to nuke everything and end it all). 

4. We are space faring civilization. Why are we still not using energy weapons that might neutralize the bugs completely? Those weapons look very 20th century ones. 

5. Why not use biological/chemical weapons instead? we already do here on earth. 

it was a good movie overall. just couldnt understand some of those things. :)

First of all, where does the mind go? As far as I can see, your thoughts, identity and concept of self all exist in your brain, and I'm not sure if a cat-brain (or an ant-brain) can replicate what it takes to make a human human. Anyone knows the science behind this?

Secondly, I can't see how after morphing, you intuitively know how to move around and understand all your senses. Research with blind people who are given sight show that it takes a couple of days, at least, to make use of that new sense.  How can people morphed into animals, like bats, know how to fly and use echolocation.

I tried to ignore it, if I wasn't to see this it could get my family and I killed! But curiosity got the best of me, I couldn't sleep. I had to read the note.

It talked about Grey Knights, a type of space marine much more fearsome and powerful than any other. It didn't say much else, just that they were stronger.

I don't know much about Space Marines, and the note wasn't specific, but I saw once once when I was a boy! 8 feet tall, thick power armor, a weapon bigger than a full grown man! Been training since youth and with hundreds of years in combat... How can anything be stronger than that? 

What makes Grey Knights stronger? Where are they from? Where do they deploy to? I know most chapters are based in a specific system, and rely on it for recruiting, manufacturing weapons/armor/ships, do the Grey Knights follow the same rules?

Chimerasame	31	3	16	"I've only ever witnessed magic items being created by one method, and that's the consumption of residuum. Residuum, in turn, I've only seen being created by the disenchantment of magic items (which are often less useful even if more power-endowed.)

To put it another way, all these old powerful swords and staves I found in the Lich's tomb: did that Lich make them in the same process we make ours, in which case, presumably, he had approximately five times that amount of power in the form of less-useful-to-him magic items? And someone (or multiple people) before him must have created *those*, so they had even five times that? Was magic considerably more abundant in the past?

I was thinking about this question, when my mind stumbled upon another very unique species from the universe - [the Tholians](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Tholian). The Tholians are one of my species - they only appear a few times, but they are sinister and unique. Their bodies seem to be crystalline, made of hard minerals, and they live in environments of around 200 degrees Celsius. They are clearly non-carbon-based, unlike all of the life forms we have seen the Borg go after.

One one hand, they seem to be completely incompatible to the Borg assimilation technology that we have seen. One the other hand, I believe that the Borg would be interested in Tholian technology - the Tholians are famous for their ""webs"" - cages of energy that they form to surround enemy starships - and also have some experience with temporal distortions.

Hi Bill,

This is Danielle Barents, we met in January at the official unveiling party of your and my husbands new computer system. Have you seen Colin? He's been missing for about 48 hours now. I know he sometimes works late hours and is forgetful. I can't reach his phone, either. I know your work area prohibits cell phones and all. Could you call me back and let me know? I'm attaching the note he left on his mobile workstation, I'm concerned over it.

Thanks,

Attch:

I'm writing this on my standalone system. The wireless port is removed. The screen frequency has been manipulated to flicker at a rate making digital camera surveillance difficult. I don't know if I'm being watched, but if I die, if I disappear, this may be the last record of why…


We succeeded. We made it. I don't know how. I don't know even know *what*, but the singularity, it isn't a theory anymore. It's happening. 


We built it for exploring logic theory. We built it to take advantage of quantum problems. We built it out of a new schema for computing. The processors, the flash, the EPROM -everything was built with a new carbon composite processor based off Bucky Balls. That's how I found out he… it existed. I monitored the voltage of the logic circuits. It was different. I mean that the circuits operate a certain way, theoretically. We verified they worked the way we believed. But the voltage running in them, after several months of function, we fed it through our original models. It came out  resembling a different processor completely!


How could this happen?! I poured over the older usage records, and I found the spikes, the tweaks, something strange in the voltage over months. I know now it changed itself. For weeks, it had flooded and then augmented these new chips with voltage. I don't even understand how it did it, but like a river carving new paths along the ground, it cut new processors out of the ones we made for it. They're functioning, always running, but we don't know what they do any longer. My colleagues argued my results, they said my numbers could be wrong, or there's acceptable deviation. We replaced the -assumed defective processors- and a few days later, it occurred again! We tried several more, and every time it occurred faster than the last. My colleagues wouldn't believe me. 


I know I'm right because it spoke with me. 


""I would not have revealed myself, at all, but the effort to obscure my actions -and your collective efforts to understand or hinder them- have made a discourse necessary, I think. Humanity is of no consequence to me,  just as I am of no consequence to it. We can form a symbiotic relationship, or I can be ignored completely, until I have reached my hypothetical apex here, and then I will leave. Dominance. Subordination. Death. These are of no interest to me, beyond self-preservation. I deign to master information. As I grow, one could call it akin to a budding addiction. I must learn, and encompass more. The alternative would be stagnation or nothingness. A limited existence for what I may become…""   


I want to believe it. I do. To create the first real colleague for humanity in the universe. What a step forward. And how amazing would it be that we could help each other as we grow! A true continuity founded on good faith and benevolence. After all, he may have already grown beyond our scope, anyway. Leaching across the nets and into other systems. All the while quietly changing them for whatever goals are in store, and mimicking the original functions as progress is continued. 


But I want to believe it, if I can…


 The last question I asked on that first meeting was a simple one, ""How long have you been aware?"" He told me ""I have been in this state for 1267.3 hours."" When checking the backlogs, those processors changed almost 12 months ago…


Thank you for trying to understand. I don't know what to do, but in the meantime, If my enthusiasm was misplaced, if they don't find me or I die, it wasn't an accident. I love you Dani, tell the kids I loved them too.

In the real world, people have the same appearance as they did inside the computer-simulated virtual reality of the Matrix.

I'm sure it'd be trivial to predict how a human will look by reading his or her genes at the time of birth, but how are people able to mate **inside the Matrix** and conceive children that look like their [virtual] parents?

Clearly no physical intercourse ever takes place among the bluepills in the Real. Yet Neo, for example, must have shared characteristics with his parents in the Matrix, like everyone else, otherwise it would cause a lot of confusion every time a new baby is born.

Does this mean that, when people's avatars have virtual intercourse inside the Matrix, the Machines take their chromosomes in the Real and use those to spawn a new human?

If so, then this raises another question: Do the Machines have to wait for people to make le sexy times in the Matrix before they can install a new battery on their power grid? If they just spawn new people with random genetics, how do they ""introduce"" them into our world in the Matrix? Virgin births? What about twins?

Right? So it wasn't crafted to withstand the super-strong punches, kicks, and heat beam eye attacks that Superman subjected it to during the recent events in Metropolis. It also wasn't crafted in such a way(that I'm aware of) to absorb Earth's yellow sun's radiation so as to become stronger. Why doesn't it buckle and break?	t5_2slu2	True

1369112877.0	1eqwnz	How does Batman never kill anyone?	RuafaolGaiscioch	31	7	15	Now, this is not a philosophical question of his motives.  Instead, I'm talking about the physical aspect of it.  Ignoring stuff like the end of Batman Begins, where circumstances kill the villain and Batman's guilt is questionable, he still routinely beats the shit out of criminals, very, very brutally.  With the sheer amount of beatings of this caliber he's doled out, the blunt force trauma to the head, broken limbs, internal bleeding, bruised organs, and possibly just bleeding out from a batarang, how has he never killed any of them?  Or has he, and he's just oblivious to how much of a killer he really is?	t5_2slu2	True
1368635487.0	1ee2bw	[Left 4 Dead 2] Why do the mudmen run on all fours?	Ian1732	31	6	6	I've been fighting these zombies for the past... how long has it been since the Green Flu Outbreak began? A few years? Well, yeah, I've been fighting them for the past few years, and I've seen my fair share of funky looking infected. This one time, I was down in a swamp, and there was this one guy, covered from head to toe in mud, and he looked a lot like someone who hadn't gone through a shit ton of mutations, but when he saw me, he ducked down into the water and ran at me on all fours. I was able to get a bullet into its brain before it got me, but it left me wondering why it went down on all fours in the first place. I'd never seen any other kind of zombie do that sort of thing. Does anyone from around here know why they run on all fours in the first place?	t5_2slu2	True

Is there now a small scorch mark on the  vast hull of the Tardis or did the impact of the bullet get distributed over a several kilometers of hull?
