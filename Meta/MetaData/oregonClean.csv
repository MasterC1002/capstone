LettersFromTheSky	47	4	12	"Amending our State Constitution is pretty serious in my opinion so we should take the time to read the measures and make sure that we're not passing an amendment we're going to regret later on. 

The Constitutional Amendments:

**Measure 77: Catastrophic Disaster Amendment**

*  Authorizes the governor to declare a catastrophic disaster and bring legislators into session. Authorizes suspending specified constitutional spending restrictions.

**Measure 78: Government Branches Amendment**

Summary: The proposed measure changes the terminology in the state Constitution for the three state government branches. Makes grammatical and spelling changes. 


**Measure 79: Real Estate Transfer Tax Amendment** 

* Result of ""Yes"" Vote: ""Yes"" vote prohibits state/local governments from imposing taxes, fees, assessments on transfer of any interest in real property, except those operative December 31, 2009.

* Result of ""No"" Vote: ""No"" vote retains existing law prohibiting local governments from imposing real estate transfer taxes/fees (with exceptions), allowing state legislature to impose such taxes/fees.

Summary: Amends constitution. Current statutory law prohibits a city, county, district, or other political subdivision or municipal corporation from imposing taxes or fees on the transfer of real estate (with certain exceptions). However, the state legislature has the authority, subject to Governor approval, to impose such taxes and fees or to change current statutory law. Measure prohibits the state and any city, county, district, or other political subdivision or municipal corporation from imposing taxes, fees, or other assessments based upon the transfer of any interest in real property or measure by the consideration paid or received upon the transfer of any interest in real property. Measure exempts from the prohibition any taxes, fees, or other assessments in effect and operative on December 31, 2009. 

**Measure 82: Privately-Owned Casinos Amendment** (side note: Measure 83 is related to Measure 82 and even if Measure 83 passes it is not valid unless Measure 82 is passed) 

* Result of ""Yes"" Vote: ""Yes"" vote amends state constitution to authorize privately-owned casinos; requires such casinos to give percentage of monthly revenue to State Lottery for specified purposes.

* Result of ""No"" Vote: ""No"" vote maintains the current state of the law, which does not authorize any privately-owned casino or casinos anywhere in the State of Oregon. 

Summary: Amends constitution. Currently, Oregon Constitution prohibits the operation of any casino within state (unless it's land owned by Indians). Under measure, State Lottery shall permit the operation of privately-owned casinos within the state, provided that the particular operation is approved through initiative law. If the privately-owned casino is to be located within an incorporated city, city electors must also approve casino location. The privately-owned casino shall pay 25% of adjusted gross revenues each month to a fund created by law for the purposes of fostering job growth, educational achievement, vibrant local communities, protecting and improving natural environment, and supporting all federally recognized Indian tribes in Oregon. Amendment does not prohibit operation of privately-owned casino within 60-mile radius of existing tribal casino operating on reservation land. 

**Measure 85: Corporate Tax ""Kicker"" Funds for Education**

* Result of ""Yes"" Vote: ""Yes"" vote allocates the corporate income and excise tax ""kicker"" refund to the General Fund to provide additional funding for K through 12 public education.

* Result of ""No"" Vote: ""No"" vote retains existing corporate income and excise tax ""kicker"" that requires refund to corporations when revenue exceeds estimated collections by two percent or more. 

Summary: Amends constitution. Before each biennium, the governor must prepare an estimate of revenues expected to be received by the General Fund for the next biennium. The General Fund is the primary funding source for schools, prisons, social services other state-funded programs/services. Current law requires an automatic ""kicker"" refund of corporate income and excise tax revenue when that revenue exceeds estimated collections by two percent or more. Measure allocates the corporate income and excise tax ""kicker"" refund to the General Fund to provide additional funding for K through 12 public education. Measure does not change the constitutional personal income tax ""kicker"" provision that requires a refund to individual taxpayers when personal income tax revenue exceeds estimated revenue by two percent or more.

For full details click the link above, but I'll highlight key points:

Fine of 375$ + Police Fees (average 800$) per violation.  What causes a violation?  Many things, but two of them are ""littering"" and ""noise violation"".

A noise violation is any sound that can be heard at a 40 decibel level on the street after 10pm (for reference 30 decibels is whisper quiet and 60 decibels is normal conversation level).

Littering can be as few as 1 item of trash on your front lawn.

Which means virtually every house party is in violation, as all it takes is 1 red cup on the lawn and 1 open window with some light music playing to bring the ~1,175$ smack down on a single college student.

What's more is that after 4 violations at the same address (not even by the same tenant) will cause a fine against the property owner.  Property owners are not allowed to evict tenants based on their violation of this ordinance and even if they could, they have no way of guaranteeing that the next tenant won't have any social gatherings after 10pm.

Which means there are only 2 ways for property owners to protect themselves: Do not rent to students or charge higher rent to make up for possible expenses.  With both fewer places to be rented for students (lower supply, just as much demand) AND those that are rent already raising rent costs; renting a place in Eugene is about to get a lot more expensive for students.

My girlfriend and I are coming all the way from Sweden this summer for a “See the USA” trip that will include NYC, Chicago, Empire Builder train ride, and a roadtrip section to take us from Portland down to San Francisco. We have been doing homework for the trip for quite some time, but of course there are still questions, so I’m wondering if you guys would help us out?

This is obviously a once-in-a-lifetime thing for us, so we’d greatly appreciate your help making it as awesome as it can be!

Here are our questions:

1.	We’re arriving in Portland on a Saturday morning, and will probably just want an easy day walking around. We’ve read about the Saturday Market, would that be your best tip?


2.	The coastal route wins over inland, right? We know the inland route has Crater Lake and more, but the coast seems just generally *National Geographic* all over, with such an abundance of sights and scenery, plus it takes us right down among the Redwoods in California?


3.	The classic question: Any secret tips for what to see? We have done a lot of googling and are aware of the Undersea Gardens, the Sea Lion caves, the coast aquarium etc, and we plan to keep our eyes open for surprise signposts along the road as well. Anything we still might miss, and really shouldn’t?

4.	How lucky would we need to get to see whales off season? Can we find out somehow if any have been spotted once we're there?

5.	Should we be pre-booking places to stay? On earlier US trips I’ve always been able to find a bed at random roadside hotels and motels, will this work in Oregon as well? Anyplace really special where we should spend a night?

6.	All those national forests and such along the coast are just too many to google – can you guys tell us some favorites for some light hiking stops?

7. We keep reading about ""tide pools"", but where exactly do we go to see these?

If you want some extra info on us: We are a regular m/f couple, both early 30s, both Swedish. We are fairly seasoned travelers, although GF has never been to the US before (I have, several times, but not to the west coast). We have a decent budget for the trip. We are nature lovers, but also of course like all the usual travel stuff, such as museums, great restaurants, ""weird experiences"" and so on. Alcohol and heavy physical exertion are out for this trip, so no Portland breweries or more than fairly light hiking. We are also not into huge crowds or motorsports.

A big thanks to anyone who wants to help us!"	t5_2qhjg	True

Once a month the OLCC publishes an Excel document with the latest price changes. Oregon Liquor Prices imports this document and provides a nice clean interface for searching the product price data. There is also a basic store locator interface. Mainly this was a case of needing a side-project and having some cool data to play with.

The site is still very much a work in progress. The mobile layout is completely broken and the site is missing a bunch of features I'd really like to add. However, I wanted to get it out there so people can start using it.

I realize that the OLCC has an official site called [Oregon Liquor Search](http://www.oregonliquorsearch.com/). However, I think we can all agree that it's a pretty poor user experience. I wanted to do something better.

Anyway, let me know what you think and if you have any ideas for additional features. Thanks!"	t5_2qhjg	True

Pig'n Pancake?CHECK.Awesome.Roadhouse 101, Mr Bill's smoked fish, Gracie's Sea Hag and probably several more I'm forgetting.OH!And if you find yourselves in Portland you HAVE to check out Blossoming Lotus.All vegan (I am not vegan) and fanfkntastic.Great staff, great drinks, remarkable food for not having meat or dairy. Do it. Do eet.  

     Did a TON of hiking.Drift creek camp trails, all manner of lighthouse trails, checked out Pittock mansion, the Japanese gardens, the zoo, and just tromped up and down every beach and town we had time for...Newport (sea lions galore), Depoe Bay, Lincoln City, Boiler Bay, Devil's Punchbowl.. ALL AWESOME. 

     Went out on a whale watching boat and have a whole new respect for the fishermen.I could barely stand through those swells with a handrail, I can't imagine doing a JOB on that rollercoaster.

    Probably forgetting a ton, but thank you all for reading and for giving us so many good tips.We had a great time.

I once lived in Hillsboro for about 8 months (July to February) and absolutely loved it! My question is mainly about the weather. During my 8 months there (about 12 years ago) I found it to be pretty mild and balanced. My sister, whom I lived with, says that during the 3 years that she was there she experienced ""mostly rain"".

Is this true? Maybe my memory is just failing me but the weather sure seemed nice to me. Some sun, some rain and a very small amount of snow.

I'm 20, 21 by the end of this coming summer. I longboard when the weather permits, and snowboard when it doesn't. I like city life here in Columbus just because everything is so alive, but it can wear down on you after a while for sure.

It appears the average household income is in the $50k ish range, whereas much of the housing is $300k-400k. How do people afford to live there, where are the jobs? I found a list of the top 50 employers and there wasn't anything that really stood out as places to really make a large income. (I am in IT with a salary in the $140,000s, and could potentially work from home or be a traveling consulting if push came to shove).

What am I missing? What are your favorite things about living in the area? Least favorite? Any other tips?

My girlfriend and I (22&amp;23) currently live in Virginia and we have our hearts set on making a big move across the country (take risks while we're young, life is an adventure, etc.) We have done some initial research and have decided that Oregon is our current favorite (over CA and WA). She is from Vermont originally and Oregon strikes us as sort of being the ""New England of the West coast"".

The problem is that because of the distance and financial considerations, we won't really be able to come out to look around before moving, we'll have to choose our destination just based on internet research and word of mouth, so we want to hear which cities/towns you all would recommend!

To help narrow it down a little bit, we currently live near Washington DC but hate the size and the commute. We think that Portland would be too big for us. We have lived in Charlottesville, VA and she is from Burlington, VT, and we love both of those cities. We've heard that Corvallis matches up favorably with them in population size and being a college town, but are worried that the job market there might be too small. Our current leaning is towards Eugene, but that's just based on gut reaction and not really on hard facts. Other places like Albany, Bend, and Salem have had their names come up but we don't know a lot about the pros and cons for those areas. We love nature and camping and hiking. My girlfriend wants to find a job where she can help people and make a positive impact on a community, and I am thinking about becoming a teacher.

We would love to get any and all input for places to live, places to work, place to avoid, and things to do. Also, if you think we're crazy to  just up and move to Oregon you can tell us that too. All input is welcome!

Thank you so much future neighbors!

1352450779.0	12wmar	Are there ever end-of-month quotas for small town traffic stops in Oregon?	-Tyrion-Lannister-	20	3	34	"I was recently in front of a judge for a speeding violation that occurred on 22 outside of a small town. When allowed to give a statement, I said to the judge that the police officer tailgated me, and so I increased my speed in order to pass traffic on the right and then move into the slow lane. While increasing my speed (only moderately over the limit), the lights went one and he pulled me over. I then mentioned that the ticket was given on the 30th of the month. It was at this point that she completely lost her shit, right there in the courtroom and said that I had better not be implying that the officers were filling some sort of month-end quota. At that point it was pretty clear that things couldn't be going much worse for me, so I just gave up, and she charged me the full amount.

The thing is, after the officer gave me a ticket, I saw two additional cruisers making additional traffic stops along the next five miles of highway. I also know a Portland city officer who advised me (a few years ago) that many PD's in Oregon do indeed have unofficial quotas or at least strong suggestive influences for generating funds for the town, and these often come up at the end of the month.

I understand that it was a stupendously bad idea for me to say this in court, since the judge had no choice but to deny it either way.  

I'd just like to know the truth about this and be a bit more informed.

**TL;DR: Told judge that I was pulled over at the end of the month, judge flipped her shit, said there's no such thing a quotas in Oregon. A cop told me there are some small towns who do unofficial quotas. I'm confused.**"	t5_2qhjg	True

In December 2012, Keyes committed suicide while in custody, after giving investigators details about a few of his victims. He may turn out to be one of this country's more prolific killers. The FBI has published a timeline of when he was in what region and is asking for help in tracing his movements to aid them in finding more of his victims.

He claims the first person he attacked was a young woman whom he sexually assaulted in the late 1990's in Wasco County, Oregon, near the town of Maupin and the Deschuttes River. She survived the assault. If she would be willing to come forward and speak to investigators about her horrific experience, it would help them build a profile of him. That might help lead them to more victims.

He might have lied about the attack; there's no record of it ever being reported in Wasco Co. But so many sexual assaults go unreported that there's a chance this one did as well. It must be truly gut-clenchingly awful to learn that you not only survived an assault, but survived an attacker who became a serial killer. It would take a lot of courage for her to come forward and talk to investigators now. I hope, for the sake of his other victims, that word of this search reaches her and that she has the strength to contact investigators and talk with them.

In addition to searching for this woman, the FBI are attempting to crowd source information about Keyes' whereabouts during his multiple cross-country trips. The timeline of known regions and times, and a picture of Keyes, is included in this article: http://klcc.org/Feature.asp?FeatureID=4199

I have recently moved to this great state and am finally going to camp at Crater Lake in July.  When I look online, it seems as though there's only a small handful of campgrounds, some of which have reservation systems available, some of which look like they're more for RVs and whatnot.

I know it's way more popular in the summertime, so what insight do you rugged Oregonians have?  I would like to stay on the east side of the crater, so that I can watch the sunset over the surface of the water below.  

Is it really necessary to reserve a walk-in tent site?

Can you hike in somewhere, and camp so long as it's the required distance from a stream?

Are the ""first-come first-served"" spaces risky to try to get, since we'll be driving from 4 hours away?

1328963262.0	pkpan	Moving to Oregon	darkmooninc	19	4	39	"I've always wanted to live in a forest. When I watched Secret Window, I realized that living in a cabin in the woods by myself and writing is my life goal. Except I'm pretty sure I'm not going to move to Quebec. So I have to find something similar.

I grew up in Southern California for 25 years, about 50 miles out of LA. I hated every moment of it. The arid nasty desert, the 90 mph Santa Ana Winds, the pretentious Hollywood crowd, the severe poverty and rampant crime, and the terrible lack of a natural environment. The smog alone stole 20 years off of my life expectancy, I'm pretty sure.

I moved up to Reno NV through a series of choices about five years ago. It's nice, I like it. But I still pine for the forest. After a lot of consideration, I was thinking of moving to northern California to get my wife Medical Marijuana for her epilepsy and be back in California. But the cost of living, the extremely fast paced lifestyle, and the sheer California-ness of it all changed my mind. I then realized if I got up the coast, I will be closer to forests, still in driving distance of Seattle and San Francisco, and able to finally visit Vancouver. So I'm kind of thinking Oregon is the place. It looks like Eugene works perfectly.

Ok, personal info. I'm really friendly and very warm to anyone from any walk of life. Though I am a shut in, so I prefer being alone and not socializing - walks alone in the forest and staying inside my room most of the time. I have experience in Television and Customer Service. My writing career looks like it might pick up to full time, but I won't hold my breath. I'm a mythology obsessed non-religious person, wife is a classic Pagan. I am looking to major in Anthropology and Linguistics for my Bachelor's degree, as well as a fascination in Japanese and French. I'm a very open minded, easy going, pacifistic, full of wonder person. My wife and I will be raising a child, so there is a worry for local schools - though I will be doing a lot of homeschooling despite public school attendance.

I've seen that [Faireworlds](http://www.faerieworlds.com/) and the [OCF](http://www.oregoncountryfair.org/) are both in Eugene. I've also heard there's a lot of very organic food, nature oriented people. [City-data](http://www.city-data.com/) has a lot of scary stories about the hate-hate relationship between OR and CA, but if I tell people I'm from Nevada maybe I'll be ok.

Any advice?

Thank you guys so much,

The beach was nice so I took my time. I did some jumping jacks to limber up, ate some chips, peed in the ocean, smoked. In hindsight, I see that I was making a lot of noise and odor.

Finally I'm walking back to my car, and all of a sudden I hear something BIG rustling in the bushes, coming towards me FAST. I freak out, dash for my car, and fumble with the door in the dark. I hear the animal emerge from the bushes and hit the pavement running, but everything happens so fast I don't have time to even glance at it. I get inside with it only ten or twenty feet away.

Inside the car the interior lights are on (they stay on for 30 seconds) and my night vision is ruined. As soon as I close the door I can't hear anything either. I am lit up like a Christmas tree and I have no idea what's outside my car or what it's doing.

At this point I think about starting the car and getting out of there, but I don't want to run over the animal, at least not yet. So I crack my window just enough to listen. I hear it snuffling around my car, like a dog but deeper and throatier.

Finally my lights turn off and I can see a little. And there's nothing out there. It's already gone. I leave, wondering if it was a bear, a coyote, or what.

I learned that just because you're the only person there, doesn't mean you're alone."	t5_2qhjg	True

Pros:

*Promotion comes with pay increase and will be a nice stepping stone onto bigger better things.
*Living in a coastal town has always been a dream of mine, even though I always imagined it'd be on the coast of Lake Michigan or Superior I suppose the Pacific will suffice.

Cons:

*From what I hear there's not a lot going on out there for a single twentysomething young guy...really this is my only con.  I'm nervous about being able to find folks my own age to hang out with and not become a total shut-in.

Why are the signs misleading? For the following reasons:

* Right now, under current State law there is no real estate transfer tax. 
* A ""No"" vote **retains existing law prohibiting local governments from imposing real estate transfer taxes/fees** (with exceptions), allowing state legislature to impose such taxes/fees. The only exception is the existing transfer tax in Washington County. Which this constitutional amendment provides an exemption for. 
* At this time, I have not heard any thing from the State legislature about wanting to pass a law imposing a real estate transfer tax nor do I know of anyone who wants to impose a real estate transfer tax.  

The ""Vote Yes on Measure 79"" campaign is simply fear mongering about the possibility of State government imposing a tax that does not yet exist (and already prohibited at certain levels of government). Nor does it repeal the transfer tax that is currently in place in Washington County!  The signs imply that a real estate transfer tax is going to be implemented by our State government if we don't amend our constitution. I think we should be careful when it comes to amending our state constitution. 

The propaganda coming from supporters of measure 79 is designed to prey on the ignorant and uninformed about our existing laws.  Please make an informed choice! "	t5_2qhjg	True

Hey all! I previously posted in r/Portland and was directed to hit up this subreddit considering you would all be from all over Oregon instead of one area. (I'm moving from Chicago. I want to get away from the city feel and frigid ice pick winter.)

That thread brought me information about cities, weather, and some activites, I'll list so no one has to read the entire last thread or repeat themselves.

**Cities:**

* Corvallis - great food, cool shops, activities

* Forst Grove - Small town, cute shops)

* Eugene - College town, ""largest hobo jungle"", housing is better priced, town/community feel 

* Bend - Beautiful, nature/scenery, ""great aspects""

* Rogue Valley - pot capitol, great weather, beautiful, activities, diverse group of people

* Coast - depressing/old people

* Grant's Pass - small town, beautiful

* Cave Junction - same as Grant's

* Ashland - Hippie Mecca, cultural, had a headchopper killing off ppl on a jogging trail =/ ...

* Cottage Grove - not much info

* Roseburg - not much info

* Vernonia or Amity - 1950s or 1970s feel

* Mt. Hood - gorgeous, lots of snow (not really looking for tons of snow)

* Mcminnville - beautiful 

* Silverton - 45 mins away from Portland, better prices

* Beaverton - not nature, ""proverty with a view"", nice place to live (mixed reviews obviously) 

* Hillsboro - not much info 

I was told to watch Dead Man - Johnny Depp to get the feel for Oregon's winters. And to learn the lingo/jargon before I arrive so I'm pronouncing Oregon correctly. =P 

I'm trying to learn about the job market, weather/seasons, diversity, activities. 

Pretty much any highlight, tidbit/snippet, information that you have about Oregon. I would love to know more. 

I am planning on looking into a few colleges while I'm there to finish my BA but that won't happen until I've lived there at least a year and gotten a feel for the area and figured out where I can go to school.

I am doing my own independent research on where I will end up but am curious if you all can help pinpoint a good spot for my parents to retire to. 

First off, the parents are coming from Southern Alabama (lived there the last 5 years) and are looking for a place that has an easy to live with weather pattern through the year. I know they would like to stay away from long periods of 100+ degree heat and want to keep the snow fall in the winter to as little as possible (they have said that up to 1"" of snow is acceptable but still not favored)

The next issue is medical centers that have good ER/Trauma centers and have cancer centers within 20 miles of their new home. This is a necessity and had us looking originally in the Roseburg area but are now looking at other options. 

Any advice you can give would be greatly appreciated, we are all excited about moving to your state next year!

EDIT - THANK YOU OREGON! Didnt expect this much response but I truly appreciate it. You all are giving me and my family a lot of information to sort through and we truly appreciate it. Thank you again!"	t5_2qhjg	True

Help make a difference for the environment by collecting data for the Coastal Observation and Seabird Survey Team (COASST).  COASST is a citizen science project dedicated to involving volunteers in the collection of high quality data on the status of coastal beaches, and trends of seabirds. Our goal is to assist government agencies and other organizations in making informed management and conservation decisions, and promote proactive citizen involvement and action. COASST volunteers systematically count and identify bird carcasses that wash ashore along ocean beaches from northern California to Alaska.  Volunteers need NO experience with birds, just a commitment to survey a specific beach (about 3/4 mile) each month.

If you are interested in participating, join COASST staff for a full, 6-hour training session. Hear about how COASST started, learn how to use the custom Beached Birds field guide, and try out your new skills with some actual specimens.  There is no charge to attend a training, but plan to provide a $20 refundable deposit if you would like to take home a COASST volunteer kit complete with a    COASST Beached Birds field guide.  Training activities take place indoors, and include a break for lunch - please pack your own or plan to buy lunch nearby.

Upcoming COASST training session:

SATURDAY February 23, 2013
Pacific City, OR
10:00 am - 4:00 pm 
Kiawanda Community Center (34600 Cape Kiawanda Dr.)

1373414384.0	1hyzq9	Moving to Oregon from Az. Heard some REALLY negative things about it... opinions?	Flesh_Odium	11	4	55	"So. I'm actually a Canadian. Born and raised in the Sunny Okanagan. However I really didn't like the heat of the valley, and had always planned to move to the coast (I ADORE lush green forests) but I met my love and moved to Pheonix, Arizona, and I've decided to live my life in the States with him, but YUCK! I'm miserable here. I miss the rain, the green, TREES! Thankfully he found out his Catering job at Intel can be transferred to the Hilsboro area.

I decided to do some reasearch. I know what to expect with the weather, but I've been reading some terrifyingly negative things about the place. I've seen people calling Oregonians creepy, crazy, dirty hippies who can't stay out of others business. I've heard people are lazy, have no work ethic and that money wise the place is rather underwhelming/dying. Also I've read about everyone being miserable and unwelcoming. Also about the bums and just the general suckiness of alot of things there, including many restaurants and even the Rose Festival. And also how it's a place where hipsters and artists go to die.

I just really want an honest opinion. Personally I LIKE the fact people there give a shit about the earth. Hippy or no. The concept of no cell phone use while driving AND no smoking. That is fine, where I come from smoking is rarely seen, and banned from everywhere, including a certain few meters from entrances. And talking on your cell while driving is completely illegal there. And the Oregon nature is right up my alley. I live for nature.
 I'm also an artist (digital), and a bit eccentric myself. But I'm a rather shy, respectful girl. So hearing about the drama and rudeness I may encounter scares me. And I just want to make a decision before the time comes

**TLDR;
I've heard Oregon has terrible people (miserable, backstabbing and nosey), that Portland is crappy and filled with bums, everyone lacks work ethic so expect to have shitty service everywhere, it's the place where hipsters and artists go to die, and how pretty much the whole place sucks. :/

BenBraddock9	16	8	40	"Coincidentally my sister and I are both moving away from home within a few months of each other and some how it turns out we'll both be living in Portland. My mom and 79 year old grandmother don't have any real reason to stay where they are now (Northern California) in fact my mom's boss is very close to selling the business and my mom might be out of work soon. We want them to move with us to Oregon, not necessarily Portland but much closer than California. Here are the complications/requirements:

* Someplace that has a fair amount of sun. Not necessarily beach weather all year long but at least some sunshine would be nice.

* My  mother hates the big city feelings but my grandmother wants a place where she can walk to the stores/markets/book stores and still retain a level of independence. Shes fairly healthy so a 20 minute walk would be cake for her.

* It'd be really wonderful if someone knew of a place kinda near Portland so we could visit often.

* My mom works in medical billing, she was an administrator and office manager. (Just to give you an idea of what kind of work she'd be looking for)


Thanks so much for the help!!! I really appreciate it!

Edit: Thanks very much everyone! I'll pass on the news and hopefully we can get them settled!"	t5_2qhjg	True

1363224582.0	1a98mm	Canadian here - need some advice re:Oregon coast!	meezajangles	10	2	36	"Hey all - vancouver (bc) guy here - so my girlfriend and I will be visiting Oregon all next week - the plan is to do a few nights in Portland, then head over to the coast and try to find a nice resort, cabin or B and B to stay at near the ocean. I've heard cannon beach is awesome, but touristy - anyone know of other nice beaches or places to stay? We can't camp (it's a bit too wet and cold still) but just want something relaxing and chill.. As for price, we can't go crazy, but don't mind something in the 150 range if its worth it. I've gotten tons of tips for things to see in Portland already, but more would be welcome too.

Bottom line, if anyone knows any good hidden gems, please share - I can return the favour if you'd like to know any secret lake/gulf island spots next time you're in BC. thanks!"	t5_2qhjg	True
