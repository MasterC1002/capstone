1365490647.0	1bz5q5	Hi Redditors, I just asked Taylor Swift if she would help me propose to my girlfriend at her concert. Any chance you can help me out?	slccsoccer28	141	42	28	"She has no idea we are going to the concert (In fact, she thinks we’re going to a different concert entirely) and she’s a huge fan of Taylor (I’m a pretty big fan myself).  I think this would be just an amazing experience and it would be amazing if you guys could help me out – I think I would honestly cry from joy.

We’ve been dating for nearly two years and have been talking about getting engaged for a little while (so I know she’ll say yes).  I was thinking about doing it this summer, but when I bought tickets I realized that this would totally top any other way of proposing.

Here’s the tweet asking Taylor (if you're extra awesome, maybe you could retweet it): [link](https://twitter.com/HopefulProposal/status/321516613377605632)

Obviously, it’s a fake twitter account – I would hate to have my girlfriend find out.



Thanks Reddit! You guys are awesome!

Also please don't kill us in our sleep now that you have our names) to the page - we're towards the bottom. Took a screenshot, posted to Facebook, had a laugh, thought it was done. A month or so later, he texts me and says we're [all](http://rumorfix.com/2012/12/eminems-daughter-to-taylor-swift-stop-whoring-around/) [over](http://www.celebomb.com/articles/10851/20130102/taylor-swift-harry-styles-dating-trouble-song.htm) [the](http://www.wattpad.com/9492263-taylor-swift-journey-to-fearless-taylor's) [internet](http://badgerpause.org/a-e/2012/12/17/taylor-swift-could-she-get-any-worse/). That's four different links; no serious articles from like E! News or TMZ, but still. This is from a post I thought had been taken down the day after. Then Jimmy Fallon picks it up and does [this](http://i.imgur.com/tMxa2.jpg), so now we've been on national TV as her ex-boyfriends. Just first names, but still. Articles are still being published, and we're waiting for the ""I don't know Kyle McKinley or Riley Howell"" interview. Or honorary boyfriend plaques. Or a visit.

Tl;DR - Made a fake post with my friend to Taylor Swift's list of boyfriends, wound up having our names on national late night television.

It's such an amazing, incredible experience. I was skeptical of being the only guy there, but there are so many people of all ages and both genders. Everyone was singing and dancing and having a good time. Yes, there are more teen and younger 20 female fans there, but there's also a good number of male fans there. Some with girlfriends or family, some alone. And no one cared. 

In your seat, it's pretty dark and everyone is looking at the stage, so no one will even notice/care.

If you feel uncomfortable in your seat, it's totally worth it to go and simply walk around the stadium and watch/listen. 

I felt compelled to write this after seeing some people posting they are afraid to buy a ticket, but after going to the concert, I want all Swifties to experience what I did. It's a once in a lifetime experience, IMHO.

However, I think it would be pretty annoying if people were obssessed with her the way they are with Emma Watson, Jennifer Lawrence, Alison Brie, Anna Kendrick, etc. 

The smaller subreddits are always better, and this is no exception. You guys are my favorite community on reddit, and I think it's awesome that it's like our ""little secret"" (not so much) that we can appreciate Taylor and all that she does without the hive mind of reddit. 

Anyways. I just wanted to say thanks to you all for being awesome. "	t5_2rlwe	True

So I went back last night, in cheap seats. I went looking for Mama Swift on the upper concourse to tell her thank you for the night before, and I found her. I told her how much it meant to me, and she said ""How would you like to watch from the front row tonight?""

We went around the upper sections finding more people to bring (I was the only guy), then went backstage, where I met Taylor's aunt, then we went to the front row.

I'd love to go to a concert of hers, but I feel that I'd feel weird seeing how the female to male audience ratio is ridiculous. Anyways, my question is, have you gone to a taylor swift concert by yourself,and did you feel weird being one of the few guys there?

When Taylor came by during 22, I put my hand out, she switched hands on her mic so she could high-five me. [My video doesn't quite get it, but it's close.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGbPC-EXgdA)

Then during the third to last song, Mama Swift was walking by, she kept being mobbed by people that recognized her. I said ""Andrea!"" and put my arms out for a hug. She hugged me and said ""it's so good to meet you! How are you?"" I said that I'm here by myself, she said ""No you're not!!"" [Then we took a picture that didn't really come out.](http://i.imgur.com/bUdlDHg.jpg) 

A few minutes later she came back and said ""You're here by yourself, she's here by herself from Mexico, you two are going to the pit!"" I got to be in the pit for the last two songs, which was amazing!

1375338293.0	1jh8gf	Taylor Swift's music saved my life. How has it affected yours?	jonhayes37	51	11	31	"Hi everyone! 




So, to make a long story short, I first heard Taylor Swift in the darkest time of my life. I was in high school living with my alcoholic, bipolar mom and for 3 years, every day brought with it another crisis to deal with (many times ending in a 911 call). It was hell. I just wanted to end it all so that I didn't have to deal with all of the stress anymore, but then I heard ""Love Story"" on the radio, and downloaded the Fearless album that night. As soon as I heard ""Change"", every single lyric resonated with me, and that song single-handedly saved my life and helped me to focus on positive things, and I am now in university studying Mathematical Physics.


But enough about me, I wanna know how her music has affected all of your lives; I love hearing stories of how she has touched so many people with her incredible songwriting!"	t5_2rlwe	True

The pictures I imagine would look something like the flair in /r/AdviceAnimals, although pictures of Taylor (or any other subject) might be too small.

The other option, text, would look similar to something like the flair in /r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon where you can type whatever you want. It could also be restricted to a favorite album, or song title as well.

Whether that be the teenage fangirl crowd, or just being incredibly cheesy. Obviously as Swifties we know that her music goes much deeper than that.

But I want to know how many of you are open about being a Swifite, and how many of you keep it under wraps.

---

Indicate your choice from the following options

1. I make a big deal about being a Swftie
- I mention it if it comes up in conversation
- I'll let a select few people know, but not publicly
- I try to keep it to myself
- It's my little secret

- *Alternatively: I don't consider myself a Swiftie*

I normally shy away from focussing on these, but here I think it's going to be relevant. Please give indication of your:

- Age 
- Gender *^(Edit: The number of people feeling the need to assert their sexuality is Too Damn High)*

I'll follow up with the results, with some demographic analysis.

---

*Feel free to share your stories of sharing, or being discovered as a Swiftie. And to what extent you might broadcast it/hide it as appropriate*

*okay so i just found out something about Taylor that makes her an amazing human being (even though we already know that).*

*I was driving through my neighborhood here in KC and there were blue ribbons tied around all the trunks of the trees. I had no idea what it meant, so when I got home I did a little research.*

*Apparently the little girl who lives next door to me had been diagnosed at the beginning of the year that she had a rare form of cancer, and that she only had a few months to live.*

*This little girl absolutely loved Taylor Swift, and somehow her parents got ahold of Tay’s management and set up a surprise for her.*

*Then about a week ago, Taylor called up the little girl (her name was Bree), and talked to her over the phone. Bree’s cancer had gotten so bad that she could barely speak, so her parents had to hold the phone to her ear and do the speaking for her. Apparently her and Tay talked for around an hour, and at the end of the convo, Taylor told Bree that she would send her something special in the mail and to look for it in the new few days.*

*Well 3 days later a packed arrived for Bree, and it was a giant box full of Taylor merch. Things from the Red Tour, store merch, basically everything a Taylor fan would ever want. Taylor had also included a pair of tickets for Bree and her mom to see her when she comes to KC in August.*

*2 days after that package arrived, Bree died. It was like Taylor had given her the best gift in the world and that Bree hung on until she she got to talk to the girl who was keeping her alive.*

*It was her dying wish. And Taylor helped her get it.*

*I talked to Bree’s mom yesterday and they are going to put all the merch that Taylor sent her and the note from Taylor that was in the box, into her casket and bury it with her. They’re also going to put a Taylor t-shirt on her.*

*So if you still think Taylor Swift is a horrible person, you need to re-think your life.*

There's this one guy on twitter (@MikeDanger989 I believe), who works on some radio station, and he was tweeting some Taylor related stuff, and tons of people started getting in on the conversation and asking him questions and what not. He replied to many fans, with very informative answers. Sadly, this morning he deleted all of said tweets. Luckily, I was able to scribble down some information he 'leaked' out. Here goes:

* The song is about a breakup, not a sad song however.
* To describe the song: upbeat, pop, fun, clever, sassy, angry.
* Very pop-like song, but country mixed in.
* Taylor **will** perform the single on her webcast this Monday.
* Radio stations will be allowed to play the single on Tuesday.
* Very personal song, most likely written by her.
* The word 'never' is used a lot in the song.
* Opposite of Eyes Open, similar to Mean.
* Main instrument is guitar.
* Roughly 3 minutes in length. 
* About an on/off relationship.

Well.... what do you think?!?! Can't wait personally."	t5_2rlwe	True

1363923237.0	1as2oj	Forgive my rant, but I feel like this subreddit has a lot of untapped potential.	wrigsam	46	17	55	"As it stands, this subreddit consistes of /u/throwfrogs42 posting a few pictures every day with a 2-word description of the picture. He/she probably just has a google image search feed, posts it, and collects karma for whatever reason. He/she also does this for various other subreddits, gaining some karma for each posts, but usually gaining 0 or 1 comments.

Now, I don't really care what this particular user does. We all have different feelings towards karma; to each their own. But I think that with Taylor Swift's fame, combined with her recent ""grown up"" drama, combined with her recent album that is far more mature that her first 3, we could actually have some quality discussions - at least discussions that warrant more than 0 or 1 comments. Off the top of my head:

* Has the general public's image of Taylor changed since Red came out? Is she seen more than just the innocent girl singing about boys?

* Did Kanye's interruption at the VMAs propel Taylor into stardom?

* Is ""22"" about the carefree single life, or is it more about the anguishes of feeling alone and using alcohol and hook-ups as an antidote?

* What will her next album be like? Is she going to be going further down the electronic road like ""I Knew You Were Trouble"" or will she go back to country like her self-titled album?

* What will Taylor be like in 20 years? Washed out, crazy, and a memory, or an influential country (or pop) star?

* What is it like going to her concerts? Is it worth going if you are in the nosebleeds? Is it all 13 year old girls or are there college guys too?

I think/hope you get my point. In general, the most successful, intriguing, and engaging subreddits have one of two formulae: original content images or judgement free discussion. Because most/all of us don't hang out with Taylor, OC pictures might be a bit tough. But if we can start and facilitiate quality conversations with different opinions and a lack of dissent (downvoting), this could be a really cool, engaging subreddit.

I would propose that we strive for posts to be limited to:

* Self-posts

* New music videos

* New interviews

* News


And *maybe*:

* Good covers of Taylor's songs

* Good mash-ups with Taylor's songs

* MAYBE picture updates of Taylor at awards ceremonies/new haircut, etc.

Basically, instead of general pictures of Taylor, we could use this subreddit as a place for discussion and sharing our common interest that is Taylor and her music. 

I think I am done with my rant/proposal. I really like Taylor Swift's music, and I think that recently her lyrics and actions have become more than that of a whiny pop teenager that she is credited for. If we treat this subreddit like so, and we make it more than just a dumping ground for Google image search, this could be a really fun place.

TL;DR: Current state of subreddit is boring and doesn't fuel discussion. Let's change that. "	t5_2rlwe	True

Then I discovered Taylor and her Speak Now Album honestly made me not care about how other people viewed me; I would openly post her calendar in my cube at work or repost quotes of hers. She gave me hope to find love again through this album. Then I went back and discovered her other albums which gave me an even bigger anchor in the music she writes. So I went and saw her in concert here in DC last year and it made me believe in Love again!  I was just wondering if anyone else had a similar experience because I appear to be the only one moved by the words of Speak Now or Sparks Fly around here...

(If not, I ask that you allow this post some visibility for those who are)	kenbw2	30	5	3	"Following [the previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/17r1hp/uk_swifties_i_propose_a_rtaylorswift_meetup_vote/) it's been established [we're fairly evenly distributed around the UK](http://i.imgur.com/LMnAn2Z.png)

**LOCATION**

**The location I've established would be the best for everyone is Rugby**, for several reasons:

* **It's central** which means the easiest, quickest and cheapest place to get to
* **It has a fairly major railway station** with good connections to most UK locations
* **It's on two major motorways** - the M1 and M6
* **The River Swift is there** - needs no explanation

I was considering different options, mainly focussed around being the closest, and therefore cheapest, to everyone. I had considered London and Manchester, but neither of these are central or easy/cheap to reach.

**DATES**

I'm fairly open to dates, but I assume everyone would prefer a Saturday or Sunday.

For simplicity I'll suggest we go for **Saturday 2nd March**. I'm not intending to dictate a date, but I know reaching a concensus can be hard. So if noone has any opposition to the 2nd March I'd like to pencil this in

Failing the 2nd March, I'd like to go for the 23rd February, or 3rd March. 22nd February isn't available for me.

**ITINERARY**

* Meet up between 11:00 and 12:00 at [The Station Bar](https://plus.google.com/115721503128640684342/about?gl=uk&amp;hl=en) ([Directions](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?saddr=Railway+Terrace&amp;daddr=The+Station+Bar,+125+Railway+Terrace,+Rugby,+Rugby&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=52.377132,-1.252763&amp;spn=0.009313,0.01929&amp;sll=52.377361,-1.25301&amp;sspn=0.004657,0.009645&amp;geocode=FaA8HwMdDuns_w%3BFWEwHwMdqtXs_yn55YqruEB3SDFlHdUxn2WOdQ&amp;oq=The+Station&amp;t=m&amp;dirflg=w&amp;mra=ls&amp;z=16))and wait for everyone to arrive. Bring along any Reddit and/or Taylor merchandise you might have so everyone knows how to find us.

* Once everyone has arrived, I'd like us to make our way to the nearby *[Swift Valley Country Park](http://www.rugby.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=67&amp;categoryID=200194&amp;pageNumber=3)*.

* I'd like us to spend some time presenting (nothing too formal) our respective favourite Taylor song. Come prepared with a few points of what you like about the song and anything you think might be insightful. We can follow this with some down time just generally socialising with a selection of Taylor's songs playing.

* It'd be nice to get a group photo at a sign with the Park's name for posterity, and for posting to /r/TaylorSwift.

* Once the evening sets in we can have dinner at the nearby Pizza Hut which should cater to most tastes, at a reasonable price.


**TRAVEL**

One of the factors for choosing Rugby is that it's much cheaper to travel to than London or Manchester. I've established the prices for trains below, based on one adult travelling there and back, without railcard, on the 23rd February.

[Prices for travel to Rubgy](http://i.imgur.com/keYN19J.png)

It might be worth considering a Young Person's Railcard if you're 25 or under. It's £28 for a year's validity, and cuts a third off the fares.

In need of particular attention are those of you in South Wales and South Scotland, the most expensive travel. I think it'd be useful to see if we could get any car drivers to potentially see if we could split the costs, rather than spending on train fares.

**PLEASE REPLY TO THIS THREAD**

Please comment in this thread, letting us know your location, to the highest accuracy you're comfortable posting on the internet (town/city would do fine, failing that then the county).

**Let us know how you intend to travel, what route you plan to take, and your estimated arrival time**.

Based on this we can hopefully establish whether any of us can end up travelling together - whether by car or train.

Please also post your preferred dates from the list above and we can reach a concensus on when to arrange it for.

So, the game goes like that. I start with the song 'The Story of Us'. In the song, there are lyrics ""I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us/How we met and the **sparks flew** instantly."" Obviously, the next song that logically follows is ""Sparks Fly"". Now, the next participant finds a part of lyrics that appears both in ""Sparks Fly"" and another one of her songs, and names the song for the next guesser. I just thought it would incredibly awesome if we could make a chain for *all* of her songs without breaking it!

Some more rules:

1)The one who has found the reference in another song needs to point out the *exact lyrics*, but the new song needs to be only named;

2)If it can be avoided, do not post the same song twice;

3)If you are completely sure the chain has ended, you can start a new one, but try to limit it to exceptional cases;

4)Please try to keep it as an answer to a single comment, and all comments *about* the game, but not *for* the game as separate comments;

5)Please, do not make circles. I.e., I say 'The Story of Us' has a reference to 'Sparks Fly', and the next commenter says that 'Sparks Fly' has a reference to 'The Story of Us'!

So, that is all. Hope you like it!
