But anyway, as the art form exists today, this idiotic notion really irritates me. Somehow, if something is a cartoon, even if its content is entirely aimed at adults (Rocko's Modern Life, for example), the best anyone can ever say of a cartoon is, ""it has some adult references/things in it kids might not get."" Or, ""it's entertaining for parents, too!"" Or, ""it's entertaining for adults who are kids at heart!""

Stupid, stupid bullshit. Somehow, witty cartoons are for childwwwennnn, but freak'n Two and a Half Men is an adult show. Nothing childish about immature, inane sitcoms like that or anything. After all, they're live actors and they talk about sex all the time. As we all know, a show is for childwwwennn unless it has lots of sexual stuff in it. And it can't be subtle sexual innuendo as there is in so many cartoons - it has to be conspicuous, vulgar stuff. Only then is it for ""mature audiences.""

People have it completely backwards. "	t5_2ubx7	True

1358170513.0	16jt00	"""Ed, Edd n Eddy"" REVIVED with ""The Walking ED"""	Firmi031	28	4	2	"""The Walking ED"" is an upcoming web series based on the classic animated Cartoon Network series ""Ed, Edd n Eddy"" created by Danny Antonucci. The director/writer/creator of the fan-made web series, Matt Madjerich, obviously played with the words ""The Walking Dead"" - Pretty much every ""EEnE"" episode title is a popular quote with one word replaced with Ed (for example, ""Take This Job and Shove It"" was turned into the episode title ""Take This Ed and Shove It""). It'll be some kind of survival horror series, probably with a touch of comedy. 
While I'm a Cartoon Network live action hater myself, I can't wait for this! A funding campaign coming soon

When I first stumbled upon this a few years ago, I could not stop reading it. If you were as big a fan as I was of this show as a kid, being an adult and reading this person's hilarious take on the show will have you in stitches. I highly recommend starting at the beginning and working your way from there. I was laughing until I was crying many, many times."	t5_2ubx7	True

TooMuchExplained	25	8	9	"I have been looking for the original pilot of the wild thornberrys for a while now with no luck. [The pilot](http://www.tv.com/shows/the-wild-thornberrys/pilot-70904/) where Eliza gets her powers.

The pilot is not included in the DVD release. I have checked several torrent sites with no luck, and searching on google (using various search phrases) only gives information about the episode or shows the first episode of the DVD release as a pilot.

Does this episode still actually exist somewhere?"	t5_2ubx7	True

Some of you may also know about the recent IAmAs with Christian Tremblay (the co-creator of the SWAT Kats) and his discussion about getting the series back into production. One problem that he hinted at was that Warner Brothers doesn't seem to want to get the series back into production. Now stop me if this sounds stupid: a kick-tail (ha-ha) fan campaign gets organized and sends cans of tuna to WB along with letters that *politely* ask to reconsider their decision. Okay, that's a bit of a flight of fancy, but something needs to be done to get WB on board with this considering that the series rights are apparently split between them and the Tremblays. So I need help in a few areas:

* Suggestions for possible campaigns.

* Planning and running the campaigns.

* Advertising the campaigns.

If anybody is interested, just tell me which way you want to help me and I'll PM you my Skype username. Later on, we'll decide on a good time to meet based on our locations."	t5_2ubx7	True

the description is that it was about this teenage kid who finds out there are aliens on earth or something and there are tons of hijinks and there are these things called Howlers which are alien dogs which are really scary and hunt people down, then in the last couple of episodes you find out that the president of the US is an alien and that the aliens have a moon base that the teenage kid attacks with his friends and then the teenage kid's dad cruises by.

anyways I'm sorry for how super vague this is but I would really love to know the name of this series and if there was anyway to watch it again."	t5_2ubx7	True

There were three contestants, and on each turn a contestant had the opportunity to tell a video game character (I want to say his name was Max, or something similar) to go X spaces to the left, right, up, down.  The character then moved to that space and it would trigger a mini game that they had to play to win the round.  The mini-games were like green screen challenges that made it seem like they were actually in the video game.  I also remember that there was a minigame type that has something to do with ""a bully"".

Once a special item was found they moved onto a new level, where the game basically just repeated, I don't remember if there were a set number of rounds or not.

I want to find the titles of two cartoons I've watched as kid back in the 90s. Problem is I only remember a few details about them.
In the first one the main character is a blond young man, somewhere around his 20s (maybe less). His features are close to those of Goltar, I think. His role is to gourd the sacred diamond from the forces of evil (with the balance of the world being at stake, as always). Alas, due to series of unfortunate events (which I do not remember) and meddling of the forces of evil (in the form of a Darth-Vader- like character) the diamond's energy (or soul, not sure) was divided into multiple pieces and scattered around the world. So, the protagonist and his faithful worm side kick set out on perilous journey to retrieve the scattered pieces. Problem is, the pieces now inhabit various places and beings and have the freedom to refuse the return to their former state. The hero has to hurry, because the diamond is growing week and unstable.
The show probably aired on British Cartoon Network around 1994. Not sure about the producers, probably Hanna Barbera. 
The info I have about the second one is even more scarce. A group of people manage to predict the future of their planet. It is grim, for the Sun is soon to erupt. The planet's government ignores the information. A group of children (or slowly aging individuals) developed a female android to lead them into safety, into a new world. And so they embarked on a space journey to find a new home, facing danger, pirates and what not. 
At this point I am unsure what came first, the android or the prediction of the grate annihilation. 
This cartoon probably aired around 1994 or earlier.
So Reddit, did these cartoons exist or am I just a victim to false memory syndrome? Plus, sorry for the grammar mistakes, English is not my first language. "	t5_2ubx7	True

I've been having trouble for awhile trying to remember the names of these two cartoons from my childhood. I live in California, and used to wake up every Sunday morning to watch UPN (channel 13 over here) cartoons. 

One of the cartoons was kind of weird, I don't really remember too much except that the main cast morphed into some sort of cars, and when they showed them like that it was in some 3d animation sort of thing. Thats really all I remember. I have no clue as to why they did that, I think they used it to fight evil monsters. And I think their main hangout/hideout was a garage.

The second cartoon was about pilots that piloted robots and used them to fight in arenas for people's entertainment. I believe that first episode the main character was a young pilot, and he piloted a sort of rodeo clown. It mainly seemed to be about a good and a bad team. I also remember another episode where the ""bad team"" found some sort of way to upgrade there robots and beat the good team in the arena with them, so the good team snuck into their base underground and managed to upgrade the main guys robot. I remember comparing this to Gundam Wing, so this show was probably out in the early 2000s.

If any of you have any sort of clue on what shows these are, please help!"	t5_2ubx7	True

1352940007.0	137n3i	Help us out (shameless plug ahead)		7	1	2	"For those of you who were lucky enough to have cable in the early 90s. You might have recalled a series called SWAT Kats; The Radical Squadron. While the show did have some cheesy moments (it was the early 90s) it was overall a pretty decent show. Despite being the #1 syndicated show of 1994, it was canceled by Ted Turner (the official reason given was that it was ""too violent"" although there are rumors that Turner was upset that SWAT Kats was getting more attention than Captain Planet). 

Christian Tremblay (one of the creators of SWAT Kats) has in a few emails hinted about bringing the series back. The remaining fans of the show are excited about this (naturally) and want to help Mr. Tremblay wherever possible. However, we're still a pretty small group. If we're to be successful the first thing we need are more people.

The site with the most people participating is Facebook, the particular group can be found [here](http://www.facebook.com/groups/150713438282857/). If you want to join, then by all means do. If you don't, that's okay too. If you want to downvote me, you can do that as well."	t5_2ubx7	True
