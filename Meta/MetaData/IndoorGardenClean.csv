1375332348.0	1jh2wg	DIY LED Lights &amp; Test Results! [X-post from r/hydro]	byronnn	26	0	1	"So I've been working on a system for growing kale indoors and as part of that I've put together and bought some LED lights.  
SuperAngryGuy was a big help through PM and [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/IndoorGarden/comments/1gfyvs/are_these_led_lights_any_good/).  
  
I started off looking on eBay for cheap LED grow lights and ended up buying [this 18W light](http://www.ebay.com/itm/TOPGROW-6X3W-Series-LED-Grow-Light-Lamp-for-flower-plant-herbs-vegetables-/111094734982?_trksid=p2047675.l2557&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEWNX%3AIT&amp;nma=true&amp;si=bKz8%252BpGf1R4XbeKLRa2igeD82vE%253D&amp;orig_cvip=true&amp;rt=nc) and [this 27W light](http://www.ebay.com/itm/BestGrow-6RED-3BLUE-9X3W-High-Power-LED-Grow-Light-Lamp-For-Flowering-Plants-/111096658016?_trksid=p2047675.l2557&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEWNX%3AIT&amp;nma=true&amp;si=bKz8%252BpGf1R4XbeKLRa2igeD82vE%253D&amp;orig_cvip=true&amp;rt=nc). The problem with these is that they do not actually consume the amount of power listed. I contacted the seller for the emitter information and by my best guess they use about 35% of the listed power, which makes them quite efficient but also very expensive to grow anything significant.  
  
The lights I ended up building are made from cheap eBay [emitters](http://www.ebay.com/itm/380471971154?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649) and [drivers](http://www.ebay.com/itm/111083822403?var=410179871603&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649) attached with [thermal adhesive](http://www.ncix.com/products/?sku=23642&amp;promoid=1062) so a CPU cooler. I used CPU coolers that were on sale ($12/each) and powered the fan with a [DC adapter](http://www.ebay.com/itm/200798800333?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649). I used a 40W driver on a 50W emitter and a 50W driver on a 60W to increase the working life of the emitters. [Album is here.](http://imgur.com/a/G3Hc2)
  
This summer I'm working at an agricultural research station and have access to a PAR light meter so I tested my lights. I pointed the lights directly at the sensor from 18 and 9 inches. [Here are the results.](http://i.imgur.com/OFemJEZ.png) I was told that this sensor is not particularly accurate below 500 which might explain some of the unexpected results.
  
The eBay lights look to be more efficient than the lights I built which is likely due to them being so significantly under driven. The 40W light did better than the 50W light which may be due to bad luck with cheap LEDs or me reading the meter inaccurately.  
  
As per [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnComplexity/comments/17ny46/plant_lighting_intensity/) I'm aiming for 500+ uMol/meter^2 /sec on 4 square feet so these lights should do well if kept less than 9 inches above the canopy.

1363714322.0	1alrbi	My indoor garden and salad bar	ChompyCat	25	3	7	"Hey everyone, I started seeds for the first time last year and learned a ton. This year, I decided to start 9 varieties of peppers (hot and sweet), as well as get an early start on herbs and lettuce with some indoor pots under lights. Last year I bought a HydroFarm grow light, 2 seedling heat mats, and ParkSeed.com seed starting cells/trays/domes. This year, I expanded my set up with a cheap shelving unit and some shop lights with daylight compact fluorescent bulbs. I started lettuce seeds in old plastic lettuce containers with holes punched in the bottom and used the lids as water trays. If the lettuce does well under the lights, I plan to grow it indoors year-round--outside, I get so many bugs and slugs, it's almost not worth the effort. Anyway, I'm really looking forward to seeing how all my little seedlings fare this season!

I keep them on a windowsill above the sink.  http://imgur.com/NxbeShp,UJQ79Cb,ycviDv7#0 I kind of assumed they would just keep growing if taken care of properly (im dumb) but I just found out they dont last very long at all!

RE1Do	19	0	20	"My SO and I inherited a number of house plants this past fall, and I've been misting them 3-4 times per week in the morning during the dry winter months (I live in Canada).  I just assumed that all plants would respond well to misting; my thought process being that in nature, most plants would receive some natural misting by way of the morning dew.  For the most part, they seem to be doing well.

However, in searching around today on the subject, I have read mixed reviews on whether this is a good practice or not.  What say you, /r/IndoorGarden?

I should add I've got a range of plants, including two [Lucky Bamboos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracaena_sanderiana), a huge [Pothos](http://gardening.about.com/od/specifichouseplants/p/Pothos.htm), a struggling [Spath](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spathiphyllum), a non-flowering (but growing) [Amaryllis](http://www.amaryllis.com/pac.htm), an out of bloom [Orchid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalaenopsis), and a [Fern](http://www.gardeningoncloud9.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/ferns.jpg).

I've seen a couple of automated planters, such as the ""Aerogarden"" and the ""Click and Grow"" products. And they seem ideal. We're willing to spend some money for the benefit of convenience. But I have a couple of questions. 

*    What's the current recommendation with products like these? 
*    Are there other similar products that might be more effective?

There are two main stems, and the smaller of the two has started to dry out and a couple of the leaves have turned brown.

I noticed about a week ago that some freshly formed flower buds, less than a millimeter in size, turn black and fall off the pepper plants. Today I noticed a couple of slightly bigger ones had fell off too, without first turning black.

At first I thought it was because the pots were too small, so I gave them some much bigger ones a few days ago but they keep doing this. Larger buds seem to be doing fine but I don't want them all to fall off, I gave them a bit of fertilizer mixed in the water once a week before I moved them into bigger pots with fresh soil so could it be because I gave them too much/too little of it?

I have made a few attempts in the past to start an indoor herb garden. I lived in an apt building that only had a northern exposure and didn't get much light, and what few successes I had (cilantro, basil) were eaten by my puppy so I gave up. 

My current place has a western exposure. I seeded some thyme, rosemary and basil two weeks ago, and so far only the thyme has sprouted. It initially seemed to be doing pretty well, but then after watering (I hadn't watered in 5 days and the soil was quite dry), half of them kind of fell over and shriveled up. The rest seem to just be kind of hanging on, growing at a snail's pace if they are growing at all. 

Rosemary I have now learned is hard to grow from seed, so I am writing that off. But Basil seems like it shouldn't be so hard to grow, yet not a seed has germinated. After two weeks with nary a sprout, I sowed the other half of the seed packet this weekend, a bit shallower, and want to try keeping the soil more moist until they germinate. Will this do the trick? 

But over all, it seems like I am missing some knowledge on how to grow things, and searching online yields only very shallow information. Are there any books/resources I should know about for a beginning gardener? "	t5_2vyus	True

I have 2 areas, the tiny balcony that faces the west (high humidity, indoor envt), and the long corridor that faces the east (&lt;4hr sunlight due to high wall, high humidity). 

So far I have bought some grown plants from the nursery and raised some seeds:

* Nursery plants

   - limes, tomato (now 2), chilli (which refuses to flower), edamame (no flower), orchid.

* Seedling/ Cuttings plants

   - sunflower, cherry tomato, pandan (from cutting), sweet potato leaves, loads of aloe vera, cactus, spring onions and leeks (last 2 due to octopuscrackle's [nice posting!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IndoorGarden/comments/16ogr1/16_foods_thatll_regrow_from_kitchen_scraps/)).
 
So far I have encountered the tomato's blossom drop and stubborn plants refusing to flower. I suspect high humidity and insufficient sunlight.

I have been trying to grow several plants in pots in my apartment, and most of them do pretty well. I have an enormous basil plant, and some chives that seem fine. 

The problem first started when I brought home some loose-leaf lettuce to plant. It grew well at first, but then suddenly the tops just pulled out of the ground; the roots had been eaten away. I started noticing these tiny flying insects around my pots. The basil doesn't seem disturbed, nor do my decorative plants, but then I tried to plant some green onion roots from the green onions I had purchased at my local market. Again, they grew well for a week or two and then died because the roots had been eaten out.

About a month or two ago, I bought some seeds for loose-leaf lettuce and jalapeno plants. The lettuce shoots came up just fine, they seemed to be doing well, until I watered them one day and they easily toppled over. Now I worry for the jalapeno shoots. 

I can't describe the bugs or get a picture, so I hoped that describing what they are doing would be more helpful than nothing. I don't really know what to do about the problem. I tried to search through a few stores for a pesticide that wouldn't be harmful for me if I put it on my edible plants, but I don't really know where to look. (I am an American expat in the Netherlands, even with the help of my Dutch friends I have been unable to find anything useful.)

My roommates and I have challenged each other to a grow-off where we each choose a type of fruit bearing or flowering plant to grow in our dorm room.

The plant I have chosen to grow is an edible root vegetable, the radish. 
[Here](http://imgur.com/a/QoAV8) I have planted the seeds in an egg carton. After they start to show above the soil I will transfer them to a clay pot I have.

This is the first gardening like project I have taken on and it should be fun. Since I have not grown anything before I would appreciate any suggestions or tips you may have with regard to this project. I think at least one other person who is doing this challenge with me will be sharing their story on this sub.

Edit: I have added photos of both pots planted.  I'm going to see how the plants in the egg carton do and possibly transplant them later. The plants in the pot will stay put. We'll see how they do.

Edit 2: I have added a picture that I took today. The radish seeds have germinated and are poking their head through the soil now! I can't believe its only been 6 days!"	t5_2vyus	True

1358396131.0	16qdtr	Capillary matting is a great way to keep an indoor garden watered, even when you go out of town	decizis	10	2	6	"If the bottom of your pot is wet and in contact with something below it that is wet, a phenomenon called capillary action will cause the pot to wick up moisture from the bottom surface as the soil dries out. To take advantage of this, capillary matting was invented as a material that never rots and can pull up water from a reservoir and allow constant moisture to be available to any plant that touches it.

I bought a few of [this finished product](http://www.amazon.com/Tierra-Derco-GP70-Large-Self-Watering/dp/B001D1ITRG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358394792&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=tierra+derco+self+watering) from amazon and love them, but you can buy the matting super cheap and build your own self watering system for next to nothing, if you prefer. Some designs have multi gallon reservoirs that can go months without being refilled.

Great thing about this is that it encourages good downward root growth and the pots only get what they need,so they are not overwatered. My plants growth have been many times faster than when they were watered from the top. 

Pro tip: I keep a bit of wet twine stuck into the drainage holes of each pot to ensure the best connection between the mat and soil."	t5_2vyus	True

1363376104.0	1ad8qb	Advice on growing beans/seeds indoors for Elementary Education grad student science project? (cross-post from /r/gardening)	small-medium-atlarge	9	2	4	"I'm taking a grad class on science education and, naturally, one component of this course is how to conduct an experiment with plants. I have to submit my finished project on April 7, so I hope this is enough time to see some decent seedling growth before then. At the gardening store, a woman working there recommended green beans as a quick-growing plant. I also decided to go back and get a ""back-up plant"" in case something goes wrong with the beans. The guy who I spoke to when I went there the second time recommended corn as a back-up.

To be clear, I only need to see some observable growth so I can take comparison photos of my variable and control groups and I am not necessarily going to be transplanting these plants (if they do well, I'll see if my mother would like them for her garden). I am just concerned about screwing this up since there is a time constraint and it's for a grade; I have never planted anything beyond helping my mother with her garden occasionally. Searching the internet yields so many different responses to a few questions, so I thought I'd try to get a consensus here.

Basic info:

* My main plant is ""Earliserve Bush Bean"" with maturity at 45 days and my back-up plant (in case something goes wrong with beans) is ""Early Sunglow Corn"" with maturity at 65 days.

* The variable for this experiment is soil type. I will plant 4 beans in containers with potting soil and 4 beans in containers with regular dirt I dug up from the yard. (Repeating this also for the back-up plant, corn.)

* I live in the Hudson Valley in NY and unfortunately it's not been incredibly sunny lately. Still pretty cold too-- mostly highs in 40's and lows in the 30's. The weather this past week was mostly cloudy, partly-sunny on some days. These plants will be in the window of sunniest room in the house, but I'm concerned about heat (even though I keep it 65-67 degrees) and light because of recent weather.

That said, what can I do to ensure the best results (not necessarily for eventual consumption) and simply be able to see some measurable growth I can record and describe?

1) Do I sprout the beans in a damp paper towel in a ziplock bag? Corn too? Or soak them? For how long before planting? I have no idea and have read conflicting things about this, re: mold and degradation of seed.

2) Do I find a supplementary heat source for growing indoors? Use some sort of enclosed planter to create a ""greenhouse"" environment?

3) I have to measure and record everything-- including amount of water and how frequently. One person recommended misting with a spray bottle to not disturb the seeds early on. Another person said simple watering from a measuring cup is fine. Again, mixed responses.

Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated-- I am working in a group with 2 other grad students (one is doing the Powerpoint and the other is researching plant growth) and I am nervous about messing this up since I am responsible for the actual plants. Help! :-)

I have an empty wall, the 8.3ft one, that I'd like to grow yellow squash, zucchini, cherry tomatoes, heirloom tomatoes, peppers, spinach and, romaine lettuce. I was thinking of doing this over three tiers, about 5ft each, with the tomatoes and peppers on the bottom; squash and zucchini in the middle, and spinach and romain on top. All three tiers would have lights installed. 

Do these different vegetables need different types of light for optimum production? Also, how many lights are needed to support each tier? From my research it seems the T5 lights would be best; I would buy the 4ft ones. 

Would it be better to have two tiers? More room for the tomatoes/peppers/squash to grow?

The 'grow wall' containers will be split:  tomatoes and peppers will grow in their own 5 gallon  containers the squash and zucchini will share a box, as will the spinach and romaine.

I've always grown up in a family that had a lot of plants, did a lot of gardening and yard work, but I always hated the stuff. Lately in my life I've really grown to the idea and I have a friend who says he wants to help me start a little garden in our backyard (that'll be for another time of course).

For right now, though, I'm looking for an indoor plant to put on top of some shelving I have. I have this glass shelf in my room where I store all of my nice whiskies, and I want to give it a little more liveliness! I'm looking for some sort of indoor plant that grows long and would essentially hang down the sides of the shelving  unit and essentially ""frame it,"" if you will. It would, of course, need to be a plant that doesn't need much sunlight, if any at all, and would be resilient to not being watered all the time. I might even need two to put on each side of the shelf so that they both grow downward on the sides. 

Does anyone know what type of plant I'm looking for? And while we're at it, I wouldn't even know where to begin looking for a plant like this, if you could help me get an idea of what type of shops and businesses I'm looking for. I'm in Central Florida.

Any thoughts?

This isn't a picture of my plant (thanks, Google) but it perfectly illustrates the problem I'm having with my basil right now. I have seen a few little light-colored bugs hanging out in the soil before, and this morning I noticed two on one of the leaves. These bugs are SO SMALL that I cannot possibly see them if they are not moving. The new leaves look great for the first day or so maybe, and then they are all covered in this mottled brown junk (and I think they're becoming a bit more translucent as well?).

I had a bird's nest fern and an autumn fern that were also infested with these ridiculously tiny bug/mite creatures. I gave up on the bird's nest fern after almost a year of no growth, and my autumn fern is down to one last small, underdeveloped frond. I separated it from the dead stuff and thoroughly washed the leaves and roots off, but the bugs are back! (albeit in smaller numbers) I've also tried misting my plants with diluted Dawn, but the damage hasn't stopped progressing on my basil and my fern isn't making any new fronds.

What in the world are these bugs, and how can I stop them from destroying all of my plants?

Thanks!

This is the cheapest one I could find with the best spectrum coverage.  After 8 months, I had about 2 dozen incredibly hot Ghost Peppers and the foliage has a deep dark green and the plant looks excellent, with almost no effort on my part.

I got most of my information from this site on how to grow it but all you really need to know is keep it really warm, somewhat dry and sprouting the seeds takes forever (took me like 3-4 weeks just to get one started): http://www.thehottestpepper.com/how-to-grow-bhut-jolokia-seeds.html

I got LED because it's just easier to deal with.  I don't need extra room for cooling or circulation, just a cheap mechanical timer will handle the puny electrical load without risk of fire, and when the plant sprouts up to the light, it doesn't immediately burn from the heat.  I kept the plant a good 2 inches from the light the entire way through its life for maximum exposure, which tropical plants love. 

I harvested right before Christmas break since I don't have any kind of automated watering system ([Arduino anyone?](http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/arduino-powered-plant-can-water-itself/)). You can see from the reviews that plants love this thing but it has some QA issues.  I did have a loose wire plug, but that was easy to fix with a Phillips-head screwdriver and just plugging in an internal jumper plug. 

Tropical plants prefer sandy, slightly acidic soil so make sure you get it right when you start and all you should need is water after that. I used pete, sand and horticultural charcoal mix. I grew them in the winter in my bedroom which worked out great because I had an electric radiator going 24/7 for my bedroom specifically, keeping me and the plant at the preferred toasty temperature. Some wire shelving in my apartment closet made it a cinch to setup the light and adjust it as needed.

Help?	basidia	5	0	5	"I have an autumn fern, a birds nest fern (that I just gave up on and tossed), and a majesty palm that all have very small grayish mites in the soil. They are easiest to see when you blow on the soil a bit and they start moving around. So far they haven't gotten to my peace lily, and I haven't seen any webs so I'm not sure that they're spider mites. I did think I brought in spider mites on my majesty fern, but I misted with diluted dish soap and the webs? (it's possible they were more dog hair than actual webs) went away and haven't resurfaced.

The two ferns have by far the highest number of mites, and they haven't been growing much at all in the past year. I tossed the birds nest fern (which hasn't had any new growth at all in a year) and separated the last two fronds of my autumn fern from all of the dead stuff, washed it off really well, and re-potted it today. The autumn fern keeps producing new fronds, but they usually die before unfurling. This week is the first time a new one has actually even begun to unfurl, but it's extremely tiny.

I have been looking at making my indoor garden, primarily for herbs. If it is possible to make tomatoes, cucumbers to make pickles or salad, it will be awesome. Note that I do not have a lot of space in front of the window (and in general) and that I live in Shanghai (perhaps some elements are more/less easier to come by). 

My questions are;

* Horizontal or vertical garden?
* For herbs do you need hydroponics?
* Best herbs to start? Basil is not so easy to find here.
* Any love for spring onions?
* Which vegetables and herbs are easily replicable (onions, garlic)? I mean taking a part of it and make it grow again.
* What are the recommended plants to have?
* What space should I have to get something usable. Meaning enough to make some sauce or use in my cooking.
* How long should I look for before it starts getting somewhere? 2 months?
* What is the best resource(s) for Indoor growing?

I have a history of being relatively greenthumbed, but I'm stumped this time. 

In my current apartment I have about 5 plants all doing pretty so-so. All of them are placed in two large east-facing windows. My problem is that none of them seem to be thirsty; they drink water insanely slowly or not at all. I've even left one plant unwatered for a month, and when I touched the soil, it was still wet.

- Yes I'm using pots with drains
- Yes I'm watering ""through"" the soil and letting it run out the bottom (meaning, not topping off with a cup of water every day)
- None of the plants has root rot nor fungus 

Is it lack of light? Wrong soil? Wintertime stubbornness? 

Regardless of the cause, how do you deal with it? Do you seriously just let the plants go without it for weeks on end, if they're not drinking what they're given? 

Thanks in advance

They aren't.

So in the pamphlet I got, it says to start with just a generic commercially available potting mix without fertilizer or wetting agents and to mix with redwood shavings, cedar wood shavings, or perlite.
I was thinking Miracle Gro but those all have wetting agents or fertilizer as far as I can tell. Espoma Organic potting mix also seems like it might not work.

I'm confused, please recommend some good brands. I live in San Francisco and have a nice south facing window for good sun exposure, I mist the leaves twice, daily, and water the trees in their current state when the shavings it's sitting in are dry. /ihavenoideawhatimdoing

1365700178.0	1c590v	[Meta] Congrats, indoor gardeners! We passed 2,500 subscribers! How should we celebrate?	JudgeDan	3	2	1	"Hey, Indoor Gardeners.  I've been trying for a couple of weeks now to find a sponsor for a small giveaway for when we hit 2,500 subscribers, but so far it has all been for not. I guess seed companies don't know what Reddit is, haha. I was wondering if any of you had any ideas on other ways we could celebrate.  I'd be willing to put in the work, but I am still a broke college student. You can either [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FIndoorGarden) or you can feel free to post here! 

Thanks for being a great and helpful community! Here's to hitting 25,000 before the year's end!"	t5_2vyus	True
