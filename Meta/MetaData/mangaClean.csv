I've suggested this before, and i really think we should start doing it. people are going to inevitably ask for it. I don't care if it's popular like naruto or a random doujin, people are going to ask 99.9% of the time.

We don't have to crucify anyone who doesnt do it, but we should heavily encourage people to anyway right? 




edit: to clarify, i'm talking about posts that show a single page taken from a manga. like so:

http://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/1eaf93/i_want_a_shirt_like_that/

http://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/1eb1lg/what_is_this_and_how_is_every_chapter_a_story_of/

http://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/1e75zq/from_all_6246_chapters_ive_read_so_far_this_is/

http://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/1e06vf/well_this_is_awkward/

these kinds of posts make about 1/5th of the posts going through the subreddit, so it isnt thaaaaat big of a problem. but still... name of manga in title =  world peace. trust me on this.



**TL;DR: World peace can be achieved by putting the manga name in the title.**

A few years ago, possibly 3 to 5, I read a manga about an attractive female student who transferred into a new school. She was asked to join many after school clubs, but ended up joining a dingy supernatural club instead. She pursues a relationship with one of the members, but she won't allow him to cum for any of their encounters. The title was something related to ejaculation. The girl has medium black hair and is petite. It wasn't a straight up hentai as much as it sounds like it, and it was relatively long.

* What are scanlators?

Scanlators are groups/teams of people that do all the work of translating/cleaning/redrawing/etc. the majority of the manga that you read online. They work for free and do not profit from their work. They are fans, providing for other fans, bringing works overseas that wouldn't normally be seen outside of Japan. However it is worth noting that there are some groups that don't follow these principles, keep that in mind.

Scanlation is a lot of work: there are scanlators lurking in this subreddit, I'm sure they can explain this better than I can.

* Why boycott reader sites?

The reader sites are turning these fan translations into a for-profit, zero-effort business. I, and many in this subreddit, do not wish to support this business.

* Where the hell am I supposed to read my manga now???!!

[Deal with it](http://i.imgur.com/6E6n1.gif). Many scanlators have readers on their websites, and they also offer their scans for download. You can find their sites through [mangaupdates](http://www.mangaupdates.com) or by searching with the tried&amp;true google. Check your local library, bookstore, or internet storefront. There is also the site [Batoto](http://www.batoto.com), which works with scanlators and returns ad revenue to the individual groups. However, I'm not sure if you guys want to support this as well. In the end it all comes down to:

* Why support the scanlators either? Piracy is Piracy!

Well, you aren't incorrect. The reality is, the internet manga community operates in this gray area. This is the way the ecosystem is right now. Scanlations arose to fill in the holes that the industry couldn't or wouldn't fill. The Scanlators do a lot of hard work for no profit or reward because they love what they do. They are not meant to be ""the free version"". But in some cases, especially due to reader sites, that is what they end up being. But even so, the industry still hasn't stepped up to take their place, or in some cases even guaranteed the same quality. The manga community is an odd case where the industry can't seem to compete with its own fan-base.     
**HOWEVER**, bearing all of this in mind, I pose this question to you: in addition to moving towards abolishing reader sites, maybe we could also move towards supporting the industry/mangaka better? It is true that the industry is still operating on old outdated business models, region-blocking many potential customers, and dropping series half way through, but it is also true that most of the manga we read wouldn't exist if that industry wasn't in place to support the mangaka that bring us all of these wonderful series. Where do you stand on this issue? There are arguments on both sides, and we need to have them here.    
*THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM*, have at 'im:

Oh and also: Would you like me to remove links to reader sites, even if it means it will hurt the submitter's ability to post in this subreddit (removing a post throws it into the spam filter, and this might cause their future posts to automatically be caught by the spam filter)? Or do you want to take it upon yourselves to downvote any offending posts (self-moderation)? Let me know:

Also, the question of Batoto: yay or nay? No reader sites at all or allow this one exception?

**please upvote this post, even if you disagree with its content: I receive no karma from self-posts, and this is something everyone in the subreddit needs to see/discuss**

**EDIT**: okay I just woke up, and I'm reading through all of your comments. THIS IS YOUR SUBREDDIT, NOT MINE. That's why I will leave the ultimate decision of any rule up to you. I feel like this is an issue that we have been glossing over too easily, and I wanted to bring it to the forefront so that we could have a discussion. Allow me some time to read through all of the comments.

**edit 2**: I've read through all of your comments, and it's been made pretty clear that this rule wouldn't accomplish anything more than pissing everyone off. RULE VETOED! Thank you for all of your comments, I am going to make a new post in a bit."	t5_2ql0i	True

If you have tall shelves, you can raise the back row of books (using pieces of wood, old cd cases, old vhs you don't use anymore) so both rows of books are visible all the time.

I used CD cases and vhs tapes (http://i.imgur.com/gcgy7YG.jpg) and went from this (http://i.imgur.com/OoHkmUL.jpg (old photo)) to this (http://i.imgur.com/S9nrxI0.jpg)

Now I don't feel bad about those volumes on the back row that you keep forgetting about and it's easier to ""scan"" your collection when you are deciding what to re-read.

I hope I can get someone to think ""Wait, why didn't I think of this!"" as I did before :)

This post is to dispel some misconceptions about importing manga, and why a ""supportive fan"" should import series they like.

I often hear **""Well why would I buy it if I can't even read it?""**
Think about it this way: Is there really a big difference between buying the English copy, reading it, and putting it on the shelf forever. Versus reading the scanlation online, buying the JP copy, and putting that on the shelf forever?

http://i.imgur.com/hDxUgOt.jpg

So you have a series that you really enjoy reading, but it's not out in English. You read it from Batoto or another less reputable site every time a new scanlated chapter is posted.

Authors rely on domestic sales to stay serialized. Yes, things like the questionaires in the magazines are important to them, but volume sales are also very important as well. By the time something gets released into English, it can be *years* later ... if it gets licensed at all. Your favorite author could be canned a long time before that. *For every Oda and Tite Kubo ... there are 100 manga-kas working long hours with no vacations and NOT getting rich, just because they enjoy their work.* And, using Naruto for example: US sales are only 5% of what it gets in Japan. They also see next to nothing from overseas royalties, and those sales make no difference to your author keeping their job.

tldr: **Importing the JP volumes directly supports the author, and those sales numbers directly factor into its popularity and keeping the author serialized in the magazine.**

**But it's really expensive to import manga!**
The answer to that is: *Sometimes*. But not if you are smart about it -- in most cases it's actually **cheaper**.

(Something I won't get into here, because I don't know what kind of royalties the authors get from them. But a large number of titles are offered as ebooks via sites like Honto, Amazon Japan, and NicoNico Seiga. Where you could theoretically support them without even having to pay shipping costs)

Certainly ordering a single volume directly from overseas is expensive. I'll cover small orders (1-3 vols) and more bulk orders (6+ vols) separately:

For smaller orders, you have choices such as Kinokuniya, Asahiya, and Yesasia. I really advise not ordering less than 3 books at a time, because it's just really inefficient. Yesasia has the highest base prices ($8-11), but they provide free shipping over like $25... so for ordering a handful of books, you can get equal pricing to English titles from B&amp;N etc.
Kino and Asahiya have base shipping of around $6-8+$1 per extra item ... and their base book prices are cheaper than Yesasia by a few dollars.

**Bulk Orders** -- Where you can really save money and be cheaper than US prices (Exchange rate ~100:1 atm)

My preferred site is Honto (http://honto.jp) although HMV can also be decent. It requires navigating in Japanese, but there are guides out there to help setting up an account. You pay MSRP prices (476yen for Jump titles, 600yen for most other publishers)

Ordering 9 books at a time, at current exchange rates, my price per book after shipping is $8.00USD. SAL Small parcel to the US takes about 18-21 days. The reason for 9 books, is that is just under the 2kg weight limit for SAL small parcel, otherwise the shipping price jumps up and you would want to bump up to ordering 15-18 books for the next sweet spot. (Packaging is 450grams + 165gram avg per book. Shipping cost is about 1yen per gram of weight FYI)

This has been rather long, but I hope I made a good case for why you should support your favorite authors. At some point in the coming months, I actually hope to launch a website to compile this kind of info + ordering figures, guides, shipping data for various sites, etc. to inform fans and make it easier to find."	t5_2ql0i	True

He ends up getting sent back to when he was a child to prevent a murder of one of his classmates that happened in the past.

[Rin](http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=87646) - From the mangaka of BECK. This is about a boy in high school who wants to become a mangaka and a girl who seems to have psychic powers. BECK is my favorite manga and this seems to have the same feeling to it, except about manga instead of music.

[Yuusen Shoujo - Plug-in Girl](http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=85643) - New shonen manga in a futuristic setting. A boy takes a bullet for a princess on the subway that blows a huge hole in his body. His body is reconstructed as a cyborg and 6 years later is enrolled in a school for robotic engineering run by the girls family who he saved. She was injured in the incident and has to be plugged into a giant computer. Seems interesting so far and has pretty good art.

[Spirit Circle](http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=78322) - Someone posted this the other day, but so far its really good. From the mangaka of Hoshi no Samidare, this manga  is about a boy who gets a mysterious new classmate. She hates him and he doesn't know why. It turns out they are mortal enemies who have killed each other in several past lives. The manga is about him reliving his past lives to figure out what is the root of their problems.

[Dear, Only You Don't Know](http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=77380) - A romantic comedy Manhwa. It has several main characters with their own stories that are all connected.

For a Shounen manga, I think the plot is really well done. How many Shounen manga can you name that has multiple storylines going simultaneously, yet eventually converges? What about the emotional relationships built between characters? Naruto focuses a lot on the theme of true loneliness (Naruto, Gaara, Haku, Itachi, Sasuke, etc.) and acknowledgement. I see people saying that it's stupid and that these characters should just get over it, but isolation, rejection, and loneliness, if you've ever experienced it, are really scary things.

Before making a post asking for recommendations, **READ THE FAQ.
[HERE](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/manga).** It provides links to recommendation lists. 

I'll post some of the links below, and one or two other, for the lazies. I don't hate people asking for recs, but it's insane the *same* post is *repeatedly* made weekly.

The rating system to me can be very iffy, My son has O.K.ed some manga that are T but has warned me of others.

TL;DR - Is there a site I can go to as a parent, to see more of the details of the story to make sure what my child is reading is appropriate? (Audience rating aside) 



EDIT: It seems like I come off as heavily guarding. I'm generally lax, when topics approach I'll just talk to her about it. I was just wondering if there was a compiled topics list ass BassEXE suggested that would just let me know what comes up, I'll just have to research each manga  to see the plotline because Shojo and Shonen only tell me so much haha."	t5_2ql0i	True

Oh, you can access the online reader at this link, but you can't select the language, so it's just the RAW, I linked this so you can see the online reader is back to front, you press left to go forward a page, and there is ads, ad block plus is a must if you hate to death ads, the ads are intrusive, but I disabled ad block plus anyway, to experience it.

Ken Akamatsu has started a trail on j-comi.jp. One that allows registered users to see out of print manga, in an online reader, with ads. In any language and allows them to edit the text!

You may have pirated Love Hina or some other out of print work, I know I did, Love Hina is a definite recommendation for a harem comedy and one of my all time favorites that I was planning on reading again.

Now I can read it legally, with ads, in an online reader, in English in higher quality scans than the pirated version I presently have.

If you want to do this yourself, you'll need to go to j-comi.jp, register, activate by email, login, go to he online reader, log in again if it didn't carry over but it should and then select the comment bubble on the online reader's user interface, on the bar at the bottom of the page, you'll need to scroll down to see it, the comment bubble opens up a nice blue transparent window that overlaps the manga, and has a selection box for language.

The language selection box is only available to logged in users, the interface is crappy, the text is white on blue, the translation isn't correct, and the text isn't on the image at all, like you'd be used to in an online reader.

In my opinion, its not really all that good, but it is legal, and it is making money for the author, for a series you enjoy.

I'm going to try to read Love Hina this way, and get back to you on how I enjoyed it.

-update. Man this translation more than sucks, its not even readable, I do remember what it should be saying though.
since its like this, I'm tempted to update it... 

I recommend you don't use J-comi jp for now, unless you know Japanese, and want to read the raws.

the raws are what I'm seeing, and the English translations are in the reader, not on the page... its annoying as the interface isn't ideal either."	t5_2ql0i	True

In the end, blocking out two sites, three site, four sites, it'll have no effect on the grand scheme of things. There are plenty of reader sites that do the same thing as mangafox and mangareader, hell, I have 3 different people constantly spamming their own reader sites (probably a thousand posts in the spam filter are just from them). Really, anyone who wants to read on the reader sites is going to, that's not going to change. Convenience always wins over those who do not want to put in the effort. I don't believe banning two websites is going to give them that effort. **Nor is that really my battle to fight.** I think we'll leave this subreddit about manga, and leave the politics elsewhere, or at least until they come to bite us in the ass again. And in the meantime, try to educate people about the manga landscape, the way manga gets distributed and everyone's place in it. People can decide what they want to do for themselves after that.

* For me, it is how male virgins are portrayed. 

I swear that every manga I read shows the main character as this sex starved nervous wreck who can do nothing right when the time finally comes. It always seems like they come in 2 seconds as well. I don't know about the rest of you guys and gals but when I started having sex it wasn't nearly as traumatic as it is portrayed in manga. 

* Those sticky security protection devices they put on manga in stores to keep them from being stolen...

* Finally, that if the main character in a romance manga is male that he must be some sort of emotionally stunted weakling who is so wishy-washy that they can never make a decision. "	t5_2ql0i	True

Scipion	50	14	11	"Hi, /r/manga, I haven't been around your section of reddit much, but my girlfriend is a big time lurker and lover of your topic. Recently her job has has cut hours making bills very tight for her. Leading her to skip out on electricity in order to buy bulk ramen and other such essentials (read gas). Luckily she's got a new job lined up next month! However, she has to pay her full bill in the next two weeks or have all power cut off. Tried to work around it, but they're pretty harsh.

This has lead her to the sad decision to try and sell off much of her manga to help get by. She is pretty shy and thinks that if she makes a post on a new account you'll see her as a spammer, hence why I'm stepping in. If you fellow fans could be generous enough to take a look at her ebay listings we would really appreciate it. Again, this is her first time trying something like this so any feedback on prices, procedure, or tips on how to do it better would certainly be appreciated.

(Pretty much an [RT!] for Psyren, but with an overarching question)	Erenle	38	7	29	"This might be an outdated topic, but I haven't seen it really addressed yet. Yesterday, I was thinking about mangas that I should get to reading and I remembered catching a fleeting recommendation for Psyren from one of [gigguk's AZ rants](/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xtl-U_XhFZY). I talked to some friends and many were surprised that I had not read it for being a shounen series that was four years old from it's start. So I sat down and started on the 145 chapters + 1 bonus chapter.

It was great; I had finished the series within a day. No shounen manga had ever given me quite the experience that Psyren did, and based on what I've gathered from the internet, many felt the same way. Everything that I can think of that is good or just ""right"" in a shounen manga was in Psyren. The action was intense, the art was great, the plot was heavy and immersive, yet still understandable, and the characters were developed very well. The series embodied the dark idea of an Apocalypse manga while still maintaining the feel of a shounen manga and even the edge of a mystery manga the entire time.
I didn't feel as if there were any really bullshit powerups that are pretty common nowadays. Every power that a character had or received during the manga was either well alluded to or was specifically shown to have been acquired through some means (training, innate ability, etc.) In fact, the lack of ass-pullery (except for maybe the last few developments) in Psyren was probably one of the most impressive aspects of it.

So after finishing the series, and with the knowledge that it was reasonably popular during its run, I went to watch the anime and...there is no Psyren anime.

The lack of an anime adaptation baffled me. After [doing](/http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=253370) some [research](/http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/2000121-/60497602) it turns out that Psyren actually wasn't very popular (ranking in the bottom 5 of questionnaires consistently) and was cancelled, which would explain the lack of an anime and the rushed developments in the last chapters. How could they have cancelled the series after 145 chapters while other series during the same run got animes with even less chapters? I had always assumed that after the 100 chapter mark, a series was pretty much safe in any magazine, even Jump (poor Mx0, just one chapter away). Does anyone have insight on why it was dropped? To me the series had much more appeal that many other works in Jump.

**TL;DR: Discovered Psyren later than most. Thought it was really good. Went to find an anime but instead found out it was never adapted because it was cancelled. Anyone know why?**"	t5_2ql0i	True

**Edit:**

Thanks for posts so far (some are very convincing).. In response to violaxcore, I've realized that there's a bigger question that we could be asking here (since we're all already here, right?):

**What do you, as a subscriber, want this subreddit to be? What kind of content do you want to see here?** Are we okay with easy lulz and circlejerks, or do we want to keep it to in depth discussions and recommendations? The subreddit has grown a lot since last June, it'd be good to set some guidelines before it gets any larger.

**Edit2:**

Alright, the majority of you want memes banned, SO IT'S HAPPENING.

**MEMES BANNED** (from now on). If the content isn't manga related, it will be removed.

1308115246.0	i02c9	Hello everyone! I am your new moderator. Some important announcements, please read :]	errorcache	41	7	47	"Well, since the previous moderator was totally inactive, I've taken over the reigns. Aside from a CSS makeover (which I'm still working on, sorry if things seem a bit messy here for awhile), I was hoping to make it a bit easier to hold discussions for various manga.

To help organize this better, I am introducing some link title syntax, so when you submit the kind of link i'm describing, I implore you to use the proper syntax. This may seem like a pain in the buttocks, but if we do this correctly it'll be possible to find any relevant discussion via the search bar.

First off, the discussion tag. It will be used like this:

&gt; **[DISC] name of manga (chapter)**

So if you want to discuss the latest chapter of Bakuman, you will submit a link with the title

&gt; **[DISC] Bakuman (135)**

or if you just want to start a general discussion, submit

&gt; **[DISC] Bakuman (General)**

If we do this, then somebody who wants to find all the discussions about Bakuman only has to type ""[DISC] Bakuman"" into the search bar to see all of them, and can include the chapter number or ""general"" if they want to be more specific. This will be necessary as I imagine not all posts will fit on the front page (depending on the number of different manga you guys decide to discuss). I will preemptively say, **PLEASE search before creating a new thread.** 

~~Also, I will be making this subreddit self-posts only. Why? Because self-posts garner no link karma for the submitter. This way nobody can argue about karma whoring (and nobody will be rushing to submit the latest chapters), and you can use upvotes to ""bump"" particularly good discussions.~~
Posts are unchanged.

The next tag I want to introduce is the ""Read This!"" tag.
I see a lot of good recommendations for manga that disappear and never get seen again, so with this tag it'll be possible to, essentially, create an archive of them.

It'll work like this:

&gt; **[RT!] name of manga (genres)**

for example's sake:

&gt; **[RT!] Sora no Otoshimono (ecchi comedy/gag sci-fi)**

With this, someone looking for some good new manga to read can simply type ""[RT!] ecchi sci-fi"" into the search bar to find all manga relevant to their particular interests! Pretty cool. **Also, please be very liberal with the genre descriptions! You want these manga to be found.**

If you are going to create an RT! post, please include a small summary about the manga and what you like about it, or something along those lines. If we do this it'll be like creating a reddit suggestion archive, neat. I'll also say, **if you find that a manga already has an RT! post, instead of creating a new one, please post in the comments.** Also, I'll have to ask that RT! posts remain relatively spoiler free. If you comment with some spoilers, please use the spoiler tags.

          [This is a spoiler sentence.](/spoiler)

Alright then, those are pretty much the changes I wanted to introduce. ~~I was thinking of maybe a [???] tag for questions for the entire community, such as ""[???] Who is your favorite mangaka?"" but it seems kind of pointless.... let me know what you think. I'll use the [???] for mod announcements from now on.~~

To ask community questions, put ""**r/manga**"" in the title, and it'll get a differently colored link and it'll be searchable with that keyword. cool. This tag isn't as important I guess, but it's good to have. I'll be using it for community announcements, so keep that in mind.

 I temporarily disabled downvotes in the comment section, let me know if you guys want them back or not. Oh, and for any posts that are neither a discussion or Read This!, just post the way you normally would.

okay, I guess that's it for now. I'll be creating a new thread later asking for user submitted drawings to put in the background. Thanks for reading, and sorry for such a long post."	t5_2ql0i	True

But *even* that's falling off hard, and its been in production for 20 years....

Unfortunately, unlike most previous volumes, this one hit me in the middle of my exams so I'm unable to scan it like... immediately. However Hox is aiming to do a Christmas Eve release (because who doesn't want to spend Christmas in that post-Asano emotional hangover?) and my schedule is more than able to accomodate that, so no worries. It'll be worth the wait, trust me! From the uh pictures and sentences that don't have a lot of kanji I don't know I have been able to ascertain that shit is indeed getting real. Hox said he's been reading reviews that make him think ""it's almost as crazy as Eva 3.0."" and I'm gonna have to agree.

Anyways I figured I'd post a few pictures to whet your appetite. There won't be any spoilers or anything.

[This is the inside cover, it just absolutely blew me away.](http://i.imgur.com/DYxJ6.jpg) Asano's had some impressive inside covers before on this series but I think this is on another tier. Hopefully that tides you over until I can get a good scan.

The special edition this time came with a book cover and a bookmark. [Here's the book cover](http://i.imgur.com/9hAWe.jpg) ""Femme Fatale"" Aiko with a half-fufilled Daruma Doll. It's soft vinyl and I honestly don't really get how you're supposed to use it, but I'm dumb.

In a lot of manga any 'adult' situation, nudity or what not tends to involve nose bleeds, grossly exaggerated over reactions and more of that trope. A stumble where the protagonist 'accidentally' falls with his hands grasping a breast where hilarity then ensues etc etc. 
While for some titles this is appropriate and fitting with the theme lately more and more its started to get on my nerves. 

Sadly the only place where sexuality tends to be taken seriously is Hentai and for someone who loves a good compelling story with a more mature element to it. That is not to place to search for character development or plot.
( r/animeplot/ is not the plot I`m looking for.)

Now I know that there are several good manga out there that can take a more mature approach to these matters, a more realistic one if you will where in a situation of nudity, for instance. 
The protagonist walks in on someone in the shower. Instead of the nosebleed blow back or clumsy falling into the bath or what not, he`l raise an eyebrow excuse himself and carry on. Or a multitude of other approaches. 

A few examples of titles doing it right.
Sundome or Nana to kaoru for a more perverted streak.
Spice and wolf, for that same sense of maturity within a title thats less adult oriented.

Essentially what I`m asking here is, have fellow redditors found titles that fall along these lines or perhaps anything to add in a discussion ?

To many immature manga, help finding more mature titles with more plot then school buss meets Cthulhu. "	t5_2ql0i	True

I have been looking for the title of a manga for quite some time. It should technically be a Hentai manga, but is a very story-driven one, and from what I understand, quite depressing.

From what I remember, it takes place in a town that mines cobalt and... it may be episodic, but it may not be. I think it deals with the troubles of being a cobalt mining town, including sicknesses associated with mining and other things. There is a heavy erotic focus, but it also focuses a lot on story.

I only heard about it in passing what was probably now 5 to 6 years ago, and I've been dying to read it ever since. Anyone have any idea what it might be? Sorry I can't give anymore details; this is all from my rather poor memory.

Thank you in advance, and... on an offshoot, if anyone knows of any other sad/depressing/with story more then pwp hentai manga, by all means please recommend!"	t5_2ql0i	True

As I got into the later chapters I noticed the scanlator group placed watermarks on almost every page that had an open spot large enough in the image, talking about the parasites at Mangafox and MangaHere. 

Why the hate? Is it because some of the members of those websites do not respect the 24 to 48 hour release windows some scanlators try to enforce? Is it a popularity contest and they want more people to come to their website instead? Or advertising revenue? I honestly don't know, so I thought I would ask.

1369723136.0	1f6pu1	Sekitou Elegy finally updated again, a great romance manga that deserves some love (Or: Why I hate so many other romance mangas)	SadDoctor	37	11	28	"So happy to see that the translation for this great series has [picked back up!](http://www.batoto.net/comic/_/comics/sekitou-elegy-r869)  I've never seen it mentioned here on /r/manga before, but it's really a *fabulous* antidote to all the bullshit that usually drives me crazy about romance stories:

1 - They're not students.  I'm sorry, but I really don't think I can bear to read yet another High School romantic comedy.

2 - The girl is completely non-moe.  She works part time at her family's fabrication shop in addition to her job flagging, she fixes her motorcycle herself when it's broke, and she wants to get a license as a *commercial truck driver,* for pete's sake.  She's self-sufficient and actually thinks about things besides her boyfriend, and has goals independent of him.

3 - It's a blue-collar romance.  Think about that, how often have you ever seen a romance story that's not about people who are at *least* comfortably middle class?  They both have to worry about money, and balancing time with each other with work, and enjoying their time together, even though they can't take awesome vacations to private beaches, or wear awesome expensive clothes without having to worry about the cost.

4 - They're not the prettiest people in the story.  They get together because they make each other happy, not because either of them is a 1st Place Prize to be won and everyone else to feel jealous about.  There's both uglier and prettier couples in the story.

5 - Unlike most romances, in Sekitou Elegy relationships fail - there's failed marriages and broken families all around them.  His mom's a widow, her dad ran out on the family, their neighbors are in the middle of a spat, his younger brother's girlfriend might be pregnant and doesn't know what to do... Relationships are risky and can be painful, and life can always interfere.  There's a real sense of risk to the romance that just isn't there in most stories.

6 - But on the other hand, it's also a source of reassurance - It's not just the main character having problems with his love life, *everyone* struggles, even the people who are ridiculously handsome and seem far above the self-doubts of ordinary people, even if it's not apparent right away.

7 - They both have realistic flaws.  He's kind of a recovering neckbeard, and his self-doubts and clinginess are treated as a real problem that he needs to grow out of.  Similarly, she's got some legit anger and trust issues that make it hard for her professionally.

8 - They can have arguments and disagreements and get angry at each other, without it meaning everything's ruined forever.  

9 - Sex is an important part of their growing relationship, because, yeah, sex is an important part of a romance, and it's awesome!

10 - BUT, sex isn't the *only* part of their relationship.  Neither the first kiss or the first time they have sex is a ""Congratulations you win at romance!"" end point (Seriously, how bizarre is it that most stories treat it like that?  The relationship is just starting!)  They have to keep working on the relationship, and that's really what the manga's about, is two young people growing into adulthood together.

I want just inform you that we released new version of KindleComicConverter (Not Amazon Kindle Comic Creator).


For people who not heard about KCC: It is tool that can be used to convert manga to format that allow reading it on devices with e-ink screen. I'm talking mainly about the Kindle. Can't guarantee good results on other e-readers.



We **rewritten GUI** from scratch. It is much more user friendly now! 

Added **ultra quality mode** that fix last issues with blurred images.

And added mode that allow to **create EPUB files for non-Kindle devices**.


If you have **any** problems, question or feedback feel free to leave comment or find me on Batoto IRC channel.

It's currently empty, so clicking that link may have been anticlimactic.     
Anyway, in the meantime while I try to figure out how this works, do you have any suggestions on what kind of info we can put in it? I was thinking of expanding on the FAQ a lot more (Like an explanation of the manga community (scanlation, reader sites), how to find translations, where to buy etc.), and possibly creating a recommendation section (a page for each popular series? or a bunch of different lists? both?).

I'm also going to be messing with the CSS, hopefully streamline it, and maybe create more alternate themes (like the Ika one). So expect the look to change a bit around here. 

I believe I can allow people to help me contribute to the wiki, but I want to get it all set up and organized first. After that I will probably ask some of you for help. That's all for now I guess, I look forward to hearing your suggestions.

Also, just a quick note. We've gotten a lot of new subscribers lately, and I haven't said anything officially in awhile. So, hello to all of you and welcome.

There was foreshadowing, sure.  But it certainly could have meant she moved, or left for some other reason.  Maybe she got better, it could happen.  But no, as the story goes, she gets thinner and more sickly looking.  She is obviously dying from something, but that doesn't make the hurt any better when it finally happens.   Even at the very end, after the time skip, Hideo clearly hasn't gotten over her, even with (apparently) a new relationship.  ""I will always belong to only you.""

Thanks for making my cry like a baby at the ending.  You bastard.

Other than that, I highly recommend."	t5_2ql0i	True

That was a good move. 

I just finished reading it right now after about what, 5 days maybe, and it has quickly found a special place in the top of my manga charts. I'll admit that at times it got repetitive with its premise, but I just couldn't stop reading. I think it was mostly because of the characters, they all tended to be so colorful and fun that I just loved seeing them all interact. 

That's all I wanted to say, I just had to get this out somehow. Again, to all the people that have thrown this title around, thank you so much. "	t5_2ql0i	True
