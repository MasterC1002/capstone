My guess is that Chris will be the one to die. His character has become the slightly annoying comic relief who doesn't really add much to the plot and killing him off probably wouldn't hurt the story too much.

could we come up with a way to categorize the request similar to r/picrequests. ""[REQUEST] who is the character that says ______""

I think this would make those posts easier to search for and would help them get answered.

let me know your thoughts and ideas. thanks.

Something early on where his paralysis was the result of falling off a fence while chasing some guy?  And at the end of the episode Joe ""catches"" that guy under similar (but reversed) ""falling off a fence"" conditions?

The sun casts a ray of light through that crystal, and Peter retrieves a lost object from the attic, it's location indicated by the ray of light.
