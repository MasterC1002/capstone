Over a number of years I've built a site that's kind of an ""IMDB of art history"" - linking artworks, artists, museums, etc. together. Currently it has close to 90,000 user-uploaded artworks by about 5,000 artists, and it should hit a million unique viewers this year.

It's here: [The Athenaeum](http://www.the-athenaeum.org)

I'm always working on it as a hobby, and there are plenty of rough edges, but I'm starting to get close to what I think of as ""1.0 functionality,"" which leads me to ask - what else would you like a site like this to do? 

Any feedback/suggestions/critiques welcome.

Thanks! 

[Edit] Recapping some of the main suggestions/themes thus far, as much for my use as for the discussion:

* General sense that it looks ""dated"" in some design choices (e.g., the gif background)

* Some unintuitive or bugged things around logging in/captchas

* Search could be better 

* Make site look generally less busy - more whitespace or plain gradients seems to be a theme. Again, just a simple switch from that gif background might be a big part of it...

* Info/admin stuff: A contact page instead of e-mail link, some custom error pages

[Edit 2]:

As an exercise, I swapped out the gif background for a plain flat grey-ish color. Would be curious how much of an effect that one simple change has for people.

[Edit 3]: 

I'm on London time and have an early meeting in town tomorrow, so I'll continue responding to comments tomorrow after the meeting. But thanks to everyone for all of the fantastic advice - I really expected this to go under the radar. :-)  I hope to sift through these and knock off some of the easier suggestions over the next few weeks. And for those of you who've offered help (especially with design), I'd love to discuss more in the next few days. Thanks again!

[Edit 4]

Quick response before heading out work at I-can't-believe-I-am-awake-o'clock:

* Lots of calls for art movements, which of course we've intended to do anyway, but this probably moves that up to ""next planned feature"" status.

* Just to reiterate, the search function is a new feature being worked on to get us off of Google search (i.e,. it went in right after Christmas), and definitely has some bugs and is inconsistent across pages. That's probably ""bug number 1"" right now.

* Today I'll change the artist/person listing to be LAST, First.

* Several requests for a mobile or tablet-oriented app. I'd like that too but I *think* it's a ton of work to program real apps (i.e., in Objective C which I haven't yet learned). The alternative is an ""app"" which is really just a link to a mobile-optimized site, but I'd still have to build every major page for several screen resolutions, wouldn't I? This may not be the forum, but to do this I'll need time and some advice from people who know how that's done. So it's a goal, but probably a ways off.

* If people wouldn't find it a misuse of the /r/art channel, I'd like to take a few weeks to work on a set of things, and then come back for another round of thoughts from those who want to continue the discussion. I'll keep replying later after work today.

* Thanks soooo much for the comments, both encouraging and critiques. Really makes me feel the work to date has been worth it.

EDIT 1:  You guys are all fucking awesome.  

EDIT 2:  Wow... this feels like an AMA!  I'm really enjoying it though. 

EDIT 3:  Thanks everyone, and I do mean everyone.  Opening is in 40 mins so I'm going to get ready.  I'll come back and update with pics. 

FINAL EDIT:  The opening was last night, I didn't win anything but an owner of a gallery here is interested in perhaps representing me!  I have to get pics of my work taken and send her a portfolio!  Thanks again everyone for pumping me up before this opening.  I went in very positive.  (3/30/2012)"	t5_2qh7a	True

1325521996.0	nzvr8	What I dislike about r/Art	LOLTofu	1045	302	344	"Today, I am unsubscribing from r/Art and I thought I would air some of my issues with the subreddit as I head for the door. Here's what I see in r/Art:

* ""My girlfriend/mom/grandfather/neighbor/cat is an incredible artist and won't you please shower them in love via karmic deposits made in my name!"" Fishing for compliments and karma is boring.

* ""I did this in X number of minutes!"" Again, the time you spent on it should be less important than the content of what you create. Again with the fishing.

* ""I would really appreciate some honest critique."" Which is funny, because if anything approaching honesty is posted to the comments, even honesty framed as useful, constructive commentary, the comment is massively downvoted by the r/Art community.

* ""Check out this gimmicky guy who makes technically skilled things out of everyday objects!"" Chewed gum collages are the art equivalent of that funny chain letter your great aunt emailed you last week.

* ""Check out this gorgeous work."" This one invariably links to digital paintings of moist-eyed naked women or sci-fi illustration (which I like, but it's illustration and there is a difference).

* ""Check out this incredible skill/talent."" And here we see every manner of photorealism, from street chalk work to photographic paintings of cars.

What I *don't* see here is much discussion of art for and by conceptual, contemporary artists. I don't see talk about the art world, be it talk about its highlights, its problems, or its participants. I'm headed off to r/ArtSphere and r/ContemporaryArt, but I would love to eventually see a ruthlessly moderated ArtforArtists subreddit (if there is enough interest to carry such a thing.) r/Art is clearly for art hobbyists and casual voyeurs, which is fine, but let's not pretend like we all want to hear one anothers' honest opinions about each others' work, taste, and submissions. (My apologies: I may have done the possessive plurals incorrectly in that last sentence.)

Thanks for listening, r/Art. I hope that those of you who love it here are getting what you want from this subreddit. Are there lots of you who aren't seeing what you'd like to see here? Let's start something new.

EDIT: Overwhelming response, guys. I think rather than starting something new, I'm going to go for stronger presence in smaller subreddits. We pretentious blowhards need to get our art on somewhere, so let's enjoy ourselves in ArtCrit, ContemporaryArt, and ArtSphere. 

Also, I'm not a guy. It's funny that so many people assumed I am."	t5_2qh7a	True
