1329667122.0	pwhyn	"""Stop listening to stupid people on the internet."" My vet's response to reddit."	outhere	731	129	226	"Not long ago I posted a picture titled, “Why I don’t buy doggie treats.”  It was a picture of an 88¢ package of hot dogs.  Most of the responses I got were terrible. Two redditors told me “I hope you die.”

Really?  For giving my dogs the occasional piece of hot dog as a treat?  I wonder what you would think of me when I let my children eat a Hershey kiss.

Most of the comments went way overboard.  Most of the comments were downright misleading and uninformed. (“You are killing your dogs”) How do I know this?  Because I consulted my vet after I read the posts. The over-blown responses sounded more like PETA that reddit. My vet rolled his eyes and told me, “stop listening to stupid people on the internet.” He went on to explain that a steady and exclusive diet of fatty, salty processed foods can cause serious health problems, but treats are virtually insignificant. “Just like humans.” He said.

So I did a bit of research and found that the probability of a large dog getting pancreatitis from eating two grape-size pieces of hot dog every day for 5 years straight is less than 2% higher than a dog that eats specially formulated dog foods and nothing else.  By comparison, a child that eats two Hershey kisses a day for 20 years has less than a 2% greater chance of contracting diabetes than if he ate nothing but healthy foods exclusively for 20 years.

The fact is, most dogs, especially large dogs can easily and safely digest these kinds of treats.  Dogs have been human companions for at least 10,000 years, but food made specifically for dogs has only been around for a bit over 100 years. Even then, dog nutrition has only been studied and applied to dog food for about 50 years.  What did people feed dogs for the first 9900 years?  Scraps, fat, lard, stale bread, spoiled milk and rotten eggs, an overwhelmingly fatty diet.

Being a dog owner means giving your dog a good life.  A good life means being flexible and reasonable, and not dictatorial or overly restrictive.  When my 10 year old drops a chicken nugget, I’m not going to rush off to have my dog’s stomach pumped. In fact, I’m not going to worry about it at all.  But I guarantee I won’t tell reddit about it – too many knee-jerk reactions by uninformed people.

1359921754.0	17tlmt	I am shocked... and disgusted.. by what I'm seeing.	gnosticpostulant	663	105	139	"I just found this subreddit after seeing a related post in /r/veterinary. So I came over, lurked for a bit to see what is going on, and I'm shocked by what I'm seeing. People are coming here asking for help for medical issues with their pets, and every unqualified yokel is just posting whatever snake oil solution they heard about from their neighbor.

In one post, a person made a suggestion to the OP that could have been FATAL to their cat. A reply to another post essentially informed the OP their animal was going to die when all it needed was a bath and a round of antibiotics.

I have worked in an emergency animal hospital for 3 years (not quite new to it, not quite an old hand) as a veterinary technician. I am going back and forth between cringing and facepalming as I read these posts, and I feel like I need to express a few pieces of knowledge.

1.) If an animal's nose is dry, the only thing it indicates is that it's been a while since they licked their nose. It has ~nothing~ to do with their physical well-being.

2.) DO NOT give your animal aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen without a specific dosage provided by a vet. Dogs and cats are unable to metabolize it out of their body as quickly and efficiently as we can, and it can build up quickly and cause toxic reactions... liver failure, kidney failure, bleeding ulcers, neurotoxicity... etc., etc.

3.) DO NOT induce vomiting at home with hydrogen peroxide or salt without having previously been given a dose by a vet. Hydrogen peroxide can lead to gastroenteritis because it irritates the lining of the stomach and intestines as it goes through. Giving salt can cause sodium toxicity and lead to kidney failure and heart problems.

4.) There are no respiratory illnesses that can be passed to or from cats and dogs to humans. If you had the flu last week and now your cat is sneezing, IT IS NOT the same thing and you DID NOT give it to them. ...But there are plenty of things that can be passed, especially parasites. If your animal is diagnosed with worms, fleas, or ringworm, use good hygiene to protect yourself. Do not directly handle feces or urine at any time, and if you are exposed... wash your hands before you do anything else.

5.) If your dog is eating the cat food, expect diarrhea, but it will be fine. If your cat eats the dog food, expect constipation. If your cat eats ONLY dog food, expect to find him at the vet with blindness or heart problems due to taurine deficiency.

6.) If your animal eats any of the following, it is an ~emergency~ and you need to consult a vet or be seen by one ~immediately~... not tomorrow morning: garlic, onions, sugar-free gum or any product with xylitol, grapes, raisins, chocolate, coffee/espresso/cappucino beans/grounds. The list goes on, but those are the major ones we frequently see.

7.) Marijuana is toxic to dogs and cats!! Do not be afraid to tell your vet that your animal may have ingested it... they will not report you to the police. We just need to know what your pet ingested so we can treat it correctly. Marijuana toxicity has a very specific set of symptoms and we likely already know, upon seeing your animal, that that is the problem. But we need you to confirm it! Set aside your paranoia!

8.) A seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes needs to be seen by a vet immediately, even if there is a history of seizures and you are used to it. Prolonged seizures can cause a spike in body temperature... we had one in our clinic last week whose temp was 107.7. After we stopped the seizure with meds, it slipped into a coma and never woke up... because the owners didn't think it was a big deal to seize for an hour straight.

9.) Animals are not little people! It doesn't matter how well they know you, if they are scared, cornered, or hurt, they will lash out to protect themselves. 

10.) Going back to things we feed our animals, feeding high-fat items... like meat trimmings, pizza rolls, cake (yes, seen it)... to cats and dogs has a chance of causing a wonderful condition called pancreatitis... days of hospitalization with IV fluids and meds. If you want to give your animals a treat, try green beans... they love them and it's good for them.

11.) If your animal has been vomiting for more than 24 hours, SEE A VET. Dehydration can happen quickly and lead to a number of secondary issues! We ~regularly~ see patients who have been vomiting for 1-2 weeks and the owners didn't think it was a big enough deal to be seen... and then are shocked when we present them with a $1000 treatment estimate to correct all the problems associated with it.

I'll edit if I think of anything else, but for now, PLEASE, think before you give things to your animal or follow the advice of unqualified people.

EDIT: To be clear with everyone, I am not going to respond to individual requests for medical advice. This post is about not trusting internet advice, and I'd like to point out that despite what I say, you have no proof that I am a Vet Tech.

If you have questions concerning medical situations or nutrition, please consult your vet. If you have questions concerning whether something, or a particular amount of something, is toxic, consult your vet or the APSCA Poison Control center."	t5_2qh6o	True

1374128954.0	1ijlbc	My dog died in a hot car last weekend. Read my story, and may it never happen to you.	redacted915	340	74	80	"Its been three days since I found my dog Gunther dead in the car. The guilt I'm feeling now surpasses the sum of every bad feeling to ever pass through my body. Guilt, shame, self loathing, grief, you name it, I have it. I deserve it. But despite wanting to crawl under a rock and die, I decided to start a throwaway account to tell the story. Because unlike most cases where a dog dies in a car, I am not some cruel uncaring monster that left my dog in a locked car while I went shopping. My case had a much more innocent, freak union of timing and misfortune, but my dog is no less dead. I realized though, if this could happen in MY family, the way it did, it could happen to anyone. So if I can get just one person to start checking the back seat before they lock up the car, Gunther may not have died for nothing.

A word about my family: We are like you. Normal everyday people. I'm an electrician, My wife is receptionist at a veterinary clinic. I used to volunteer at the local animal shelter. We love animals, especially Gunther, our 7 year old German shepherd that we rescued in 2007. He was our first and only dog as a couple, and has been wonderful with our three kids.

Now to the story. It started in a way over the fourth of july weekend. My buddies and I did our annual ""guys only"" camping trip. I left Gunther home to ""guard"" the family. My wife said he paced the house while I was gone and seemed rather ticked that I left for two days without him. When I got home I parked the Suburban with all the camping gear in the driveway where it stayed all week. I was too exhausted that day to unload it then work kept me busy all week. (The suburban is our old extra vehicle that only gets used for camping trips and Home Depot runs). I know Gunther saw the suburban and he knew that he had missed out on a camping trip, which is of course a dogs favorite thing.

Fast forward to this last Saturday morning. I got up around 9 and decided to take care of the camping stuff. Gunther was still inside and didn't seem too eager to go out, so I let him be. I opened the side gate and pulled the suburban into the yard next to the garage and began unloading and organizing all my gear before taking it one armload at a time into the garage. My part of the country is experiencing a heat wave, so it was already starting to get hot. I got everything out of the back and was just clearing a few things out of the middle seats when My wife popped into the garage and asked if I was almost done. We had plans with her family. I said yep, organized a few things in the garage then went out and shut the door on the suburban, and closed the gate.

An hour later, as we were pulling away from the house in the minivan, I asked her ""Did you let Gunther out?"" She said ""yep"" and that was the last I thought of him until coming home later that night.

He didn't come in when I called him and I saw his food was untouched. I checked every corner of the yard and called him for ten minutes. It wouldn't be the first time he decided he wanted to stay out on a nice night, but it was still pretty muggy so I figured for sure he would want to come in. After kicking around every shrub and bush, looking under the suburban and under the canoe, I determined he WAS NOT in the yard. Suddenly I realized the gate had been open this morning, and he must have slipped by me. Looking back I cant believe I didn't think of the other alternative right then, but in my mind, he HAD to have left the yard. My wife called all the neighbors we know and put the kids to bed while I scoured the neighborhood. I gave up around midnight. He has gone on such escapades twice before, so I knew he would come back.

I picked up my search in the morning, and when nobody had seen him I began to worry. By noon I had run out of ideas so I started making posters. Being sunday, I couldn't even call the shelter to see if he had been picked up. So I started hanging posters around. I convinced myself he must have been nabbed by the dog catcher, and I'd have to spring him in the morning. I had a nagging feeling though that they would have called me as he is tagged and chipped.

So finally, about 4 pm, I had covered the town and turned to facebook and craigslist for help, and I threw my hands up in frustration. I was starting to think someone had taken him. I walked into the yard and just started poking around, more slowly to see if there was anything I could have missed, like blood or footprints. I was getting THAT desperate!

As I rounded the back of the garage I came face to face with the grill of the suburban and the answer to where Gunther was hit me like a bullet to the chest. A chill washed over my body and I stood there for a moment, not wanting to go look inside the car. I froze, terrified to look, because I knew at that moment that Gunther being inside wasn't a sure thing until I looked. It was like I wanted to NOT look so I could still hope he had just run off. Then I saw tongue marks on the windshield. 

I bolted over to the door, threw it open and leaned inside. I said ""GUNTHER!"", then was nearly knocked over with the smell of death. I wretched, stepped back and slammed the door. I hadn't seen him, but 36 hours in record temps had already gone to work on him. I knew he was in there.

I broke down in the backyard all by myself. My wife was feeding the baby while the other two kids were napping. It took me 15 minutes to go inside, but when I looked at my wife she knew I had found him.

We called my parents, and they dropped what they were doing and drove over. My dad an I opened the tailgate and found Gunther in his spot in the very back. There was no doubt from the level of decomposition that he had been dead since shortly after we left the house on Saturday.

We wrapped him in a blanket and used my dad's pickup to take him to my childhood home in the country, where he was buried with beloved pets from years past.

I filed a report with the police. Its a small town. The cop knew me from high school. He was understanding, and said it would be an ""Information only"" report.

The suburban has been sitting open for three days. I don't dare even go on that side of the house right now. My kids are devastated, especially my oldest who is 4. My wife has just broken down into crying spells at random times over the last few days, and I feel like such a piece of shit I don't even have the words for it.

I'd like to add some pearls of wisdom or say some inspiring shit about what a great dog Gunther was, But honestly typing and reliving this has taken it out of me. That's no way to end a horror of a true story but its all Ive got right now.

Tl;dr......Check your backseat even if you DIDN'T take your dog anywhere. He may just THINK you are going on a car ride.

EDIT: Thank you all for the kind words. I can see starting a throw away account was an unnecessary step. I honestly feared for my safety if people knew what happend. My family and facebook friends think we found him on the side of the road, hit by a car. I couldn't bear to tell people who know me what really happened,  but now I may so they can benefit grom this lesson.

We are taking my 4 year old to the grave to help her better understand where Gunther is and why he isn't coming back. I've prepared some words so we can have a little graveside service.

Telling this story has had mixed results with my current emotional status. I'm not as angry with MYSELF,  but reading and responding to some of your comments has been difficult.  I am glad to hear people read my story and then hugged their animals. I guess that means I got through to some people on a deeper level.

I can't respond to every comment, but I AM reading every one! Thank you all.

1359267523.0	17cwpo	Have a happy tail. How 3 lbs of fur changed my dad's life.	Azusanga	222	29	16	"When my parents divorced, my dad was left alone. He had no one in his life, except for the rare visits when my brother and I would go to live at his house. When we were gone, he was completely alone. He'd lived with animals his entire life (literally), and not having another living soul quickly took it's toll. When my brother and I came around, he perked up exponentially, and when we left he became sullen and withdrawn.

After a few months of this, I noticed that a friend of mine was trying to give away her rabbit, Thumper (financial and living situations). After a bit of pleading and bargaining, Thumper was to become mine. This docile rabbit changed my dad's life. After re-naming him Mocho (like Mocha, but masculineified (I was 13)), my dad began to open up to this little rabbit. When he would come home from work at 3 in the morning, Mocho would always leap laps around his small cage in excitement for the treat he knew he was going to get. When he was let out, he was happy to cuddle up against your feet.

My dad then started to wonder why this sweet little rabbit had to live in such a small home. So we made a plan, and built a new cage. The new cage, a 6x6 hand-made wooden open-topped cage, allowed ample room for this tiny furball to run around in. But he was a social creature, and my dad knew it. So, after searching the internet for a breeder, I was able to convince my dad to let us adopt a pair of twin doe's; whom we later named Latte and Decaf. The Twins are nearly identical. My dad and I are the only two that can tell them apart.

After getting Mocho neutered and letting the girls mature a bit, we introduced them. It was an immediate success. The three curled up and fell asleep together in one big mass of fur. To this day, they get very irritable and grumpy if they're separated for too long. My dad has completely changed. He'll text me at 4 in the morning, relaying some cute thing that one of The Twins did, or some cute new sound that Mocho made. Eventually he started to identify the body positions and sounds of the rabbits, and can now communicate on a basic level with the three of them. A man who was alone in the world and had no one to welcome him home.... was changed into a man who always had creatures that were ready to cuddle at any moment. He always had 3 rabbits jumping in excitement whenever he came home. Now, no matter how hard he would try, my dad never felt the bitter sting of true loneliness again.

**tl;dr**: My dad was lonely, adopted 3 rabbits (2 girls 1 boy (neutered)), and is now super upbeat and happy from having something to love who would reciprocate this love. (they give him kisses)"	t5_2qh6o	True

5 years ago, I lost a dog who was very precious to me. She walked me to school, and would wait faithfully for me until I was out for breaks, and until school was over. She would follow me all over the small town we lived in. She was terrified of nearly everyone... except me. Slowly I worked with her to get her better with people, and we got closer. 
One day, when I was 17, a girl who didn't like me called the police and claimed that I was abusing my dog. With no investigation, they took her away from me. No pictures, no reasons, no viable proof. They came a few months later and made me sign her for adoption. When I said that I didn't understand, that I never would have done anything to hurt her, they said ""Who will they believe, you or the police."" Young and hoping somehow i could adopt her back, I gave in. (Granted after months of harassing them trying to find out what was going on because i wanted my dog back). I never seen her again.
Not too long ago, I posted an ad to see if anyone out there knew if she was at least still alive. I just wanted to know if she had been happy. Within four days, I got a phone call and explained to the lady even the collar my dog had had. She and i cried on the phone for an hour, and she sent me this picture, a recent fully grown picture of the dog who captured my heart. 
The whole police thing is still fishy... she had worked at the humane society, and was there when they brought the dog in. They had lied to her and told her they picked her up running wild. Raised a lot of questions... but the most important question has been answered! My sweet Cocoa is now Elizabeth, and she lives happily in her forever home. She is alive, well, and happy. Just wanted to share with you guys :)

However, that does not mean that it's fair to post pictures of pets titled ""If you don't adopt X she/he will die!"". There are thousands, and likely millions, of animals in shelters in this same predicament right now. We all understand that if they don't find homes, many of them will die. When you post something on here pleading the case of your specific pet it shifts the culpability from being general to being personal. *I do what I can*. I have my own dog, I take really good care of him, and that's all I can afford. I don't deserve to be guilt tripped every time I check Pettit. Thank you for being considerate.

1338009699.0	u5n4a	I went for a morning run today and my cat, expecting fun, followed me. Having to endure watching me run for 30 min., I decided to return the favor by following him on his 'patrol route.'	Tartantyco	186	23	14	"He's followed me a few times before, but usually darts into the woods quite early and meets up with me on the way back. Today he stayed the entire time and was really bored near the end(Lying down in the middle of the path as I ran by). As we came to the spot where he usually veers off when he follows me back he started meowing, trying to make me follow him, and as he'd followed me I thought I'd follow him as well.

His route goes behind the houses in my neighborhood, near some marshland and thickets. First he tried to drag me into one of the thickets, but it was too dense. Giving up that he took me on a 10 minute tour of his grass eating spots and watering holes near the route. He's apparently a connoisseur when it comes to grasses as he spent a good amount of time sniffing different batches and straws before deciding individual straws to eat. Then we had a 5 minute staring contest with another cat about a hundred meters away before continuing on to a small elevated area of the path where he laid down for another 10 minutes, just watching his surroundings. After that he decided that it was time to eat and we went back home while he occassionally attacked my running shoes, much to the detriment of my shins. More sniffing and eating of grass was also had."	t5_2qh6o	True

He's 12, he can't always hold it. Usually, he does the rattle at my husband's side of the bed. Last night I woke up to him standing in the hallway outside our bedroom door (my side of the bed is closest to the door), rattling away. I was confused until I heard my 3 month old daughter fussing and I realized - I had forgotten to turn the baby monitor on before I went to bed. He was waking me up because my daughter was crying, not because he needed to go out. I got up to feed her, gave him a pat on my way into her bedroom, and he settled down outside her door, like he always does. Goooooood boy.

1358187066.0	16k9iw	animal shelter rant...think before you adopt a pet! My first post...	catsdaww	187	60	161	"First post here,
Been a lurker for a while but something has been happening where I work all the time and I feel like I finally had to say something. I like to think this is something people need to be taught about and if they knew what they was doing they would change. Maybe that's a stupid hope because most people are selfish and don't care about how their action affect the world. 
People have this mentality *""Someone else will take care of it""* or *""It's not my problem""*. You live on the earth, therefore it's your problem. 

I work at a animal shelter where we take in strays and owner surrender pets. I love working here (for the most part) and seeing happy endings. Unfortunately a lot of the time I run across people who are the absolute scum of the earth and makes me doubt the good in the world. 

You want to know how kind or unkind a person is? Look at how they treat their animals. Their true colors come out then.

Where I work, we almost always are full especially during spring and summer. We are on the outskirts of a town that unfortunately has a lot of dog fighting rings. So these people will dump the bait dogs, dogs that have lost their fight, female pits who can't breed anymore into our yard. That accounts for about half our strays that comes in. **It f-ing disgusting what people will do for money. **

You wouldn't believe how many people will bring in animals they have had for years and won't blink an eye to dump them on us, even if we say there's a chance of euthanasia. Then you have the people who wants to dump the animals on us and act all offended that we have to do euthanasia. They act like we are evil. You can't even take care of your pets but you think we are responsible for taking care of around 200 animals at a time and find them all a home for them? **Get your pets spayed and neutered people!** The best thing you can do for your pet! No you don't have to wait until they have a litter, it's not going to change their personality (for the most part, for males it might make them less aggressive and females less annoying) and now days you don't even have to wait until they are 6 months old. We spay and neuter pets when the are about 2 months. They never know what they are missing and they don't have to deal with the possibility of starving on the streets with kittens or puppies. Its not just my opinion, the American Humane Society has this article you can read [here] (http://www.americanhumane.org/animals/stop-animal-abuse/fact-sheets/juvenile-spay-neuter.html). 

You wouldn't believe how many times animal control has picked up puppies and kittens from a dumpster. People THROW away their pets like garbage. It happens here ALL THE TIME!

Also when you adopt a pet, think about what will happen if you need to move or what if the animal require emergency attention.  Will you be able to take care of that? What about the work you are going to have to do on your part to train the animal. Animals have to be discipline to have certain behaviors, they just don't learned randomly how to sit, stay, not jump on people, go to the bathroom outside. You have to teach them! People adopt from us and then a month later bring the pet back a month later, because of the stupidest stuff...such as.. the cat is scratching up my furniture, the dog won't stop barking, the puppy got bigger than I thought,  I can't potty train the dog it pees and poops in the house all the time even though I take it out ONCE a day, I just put hardwood floor down and I don't want the dog to scratch it (heard that excuse more than once). I don't say anything I just take the animal back but when they say this.. ""Can I exchange the animal for another that will work better?"" it takes all my will not to leap across the counter and strangle them. **This is not fucking Wal-Mart people. Pet's are not products that can be brought back if they are ""defective"". **
Also! This is a major ALSO for me.... if you are going to adopt a pet...do not assume the animal will be better if it is brought from a breeder!  Mutts are way healthier and have less health issues than a purebred. I am not just saying that, it's proven by genetics. How to you get a dog to look a certain way such a Golden Retriever? You pick two dogs that have the traits you are looking for and breed them. You breed the offspring with other offspring and their mother. (I know I am not using the exact scientific terms and if someone is a genetic major here please feel free to jump in and correct me. I know I don't know everything.) until they look a certain way. When you have multiple copies of the recessive genes getting expressed that when you are going to run into problems like, hip dysplasia, occurrences of certain types of cancers, things like that. Mutts are for the most part, expressing dominant genes, which for the most part are good. Not always but most of the time. Don't buy a pet from  the pet store.. I know they look all cute and perfect but think where they came from... puppies and kitten mills. I have been in one a couple times and it is sick. You don't believe me? Google it. You will want to vomit and take a shower. 
I think I got some of my suppressed anger out and I hope I educated at least one person. Feel free to ask questions or if you feel like I misspoke about something, feel free to tell me. 
I found this link and this is what people tell me all the time why they are giving up their animals 
[Top ten people give up their pets] (http://www.petpopulation.org/topten.html)

**TL;DR**  **If you have a pet, spay and neuter them so we can stop this epidemic of stupidity and waste. Adopt from your local shelter!**
edit- I added TL;DR. I was schooled on how to make it easier to read :-)

The reason why is my husband is active duty and we are being transferred from North Carolina to Colorado. We already have 3 indoor cats, the 4 I need to place are mostly outdoor cats. (I saved a stray one summer and then she got pregnant and...well you know how it goes when you have an animal lover in the house). We have to get rid of the outdoor cats because we won't have the outdoor space for them. They are used to having a backyard shed and a fenced yard and a garage all to themselves. It looks like our yard in CO might be rather tiny.

Hubby and I are driving from Raleigh North Carolina to Colorado Springs Colorado. We will be driving along I-70 W. If you would like one of these cats and are along our route (or close to) I would gladly deliver! 

All 4 are current on their shots, including rabies. Vet records included for proof. All are litter box trained and have been around other cats. Unfortunately only one is fixed (Grizzle) and they haven't yet been trained to not scratch the indoor furniture. 

Please let me know if you are interested and thanks for the help Reddit! We leave on the 5th of November!

They chased him down the street, lost him, and then caught a glimpse of him just as he got hit by a car going about 30mph. They ran over to him, and he proceeded to get really freaked out and take off into the city (Chattanooga, TN). We searched high and low, in every nook and cranny in about a three mile radius of my house (which is in the middle of downtown Chattanooga), but were unable to find him. The next day I set out to put up flyers, signs, anything I thought that might catch someone's attention and bring him home. Every minute I wasn't in class I spent looking for my pup. Nothing. Nothing... Nothing for over a week. I had put up a post on Facebook that was shared by a decent amount of my friends and their friends as well as an ad on craigslist, but no one had seen him. My dog is epileptic and had been going through a spell of seizures (all you epileptic dog owners know how scary this can be), and he was so disoriented that I knew he wouldn't be able to find his way home. I was devastated. He was my baby. I couldn't help but break down every time I walked up the stairs and didn't hear his paws scrambling and scraping behind me. I wanted to give up.

Last night at about 6 o'clock, I got a call from an unknown number. It was a girl who went to my school (where I had put up about 200 flyers with my Oliver's picture and my phone number). She had seen a dog getting picked up at her apartment complex, some 6 miles from my house, and was pretty sure it was him. She found my number on craigslist. Craigslist. I couldn't believe it. So today I called up the animal shelter where she thought he might have been taken. They had him. My baby was coming home. And home he is.

During my search, I felt helpless. I felt like everything I did accomplished nothing towards bringing my Ollie home. But it wasn't hopeless. There are good people out there who worked hard to bring my dog home. Today I came to find out that animal services chased him for three days, starting on Sunday in the middle of the interstate, all the way to the complex where he was eventually picked up. I found out that a stranger would go out of her way to call me and tell me where my dog was. I wouldn't have my best friend back without them. 

Never lose hope. There are always people out there that will go out of their way to help. There are always good forces at work. My dog was saved by good people getting on their computer to do something wonderful for a complete and total stranger. I love my dog. I love the people that found him. I love this world. And I love the internet, for making it all possible."	t5_2qh6o	True

As soon as we realized what'd happened, we took him to a 24-hour vet (it was about 12:30 AM) and, thankfully, there's one less than a half mile away. After taking the x-rays and feeling his abdomen, the vet said he's not in any pain and it doesn't appear to be obstructing his digestive tract, and that, at the time of the x-rays, the necklace appeared to be about to enter his colon. He's been playing with his (not biological) ""sister"" and acting, eating, and drinking normally all day today, but he's yet to pass the necklace. I've given him extra food last night and today to hope to get it to pass quicker. However, I'm afraid that the necklace will get close to the end and get stuck. Fingers crossed, and I will keep this updated, if anyone's interested.

EDIT: [He's the one on the right in this picture.](http://i.imgur.com/NtVHq.jpg)

EDIT 2: 4:20 central time. We just got done playing, and he was to the point of panting, so that's a good sign, obviously. Still no poop, but they go once a day or every other day since I switched them to Innova a couple months ago. 

EDIT 3: An anticlimactic, but happy, ending. He had been completely normal throughout the rest of the day yesterday. This morning, he and his ""sister"" were begging for food like normal. He had a nice, normal poop while I was in the shower after they had eaten, and afterwards I put on a pair of rubber gloves to check it out. Success, both parts (he'd broken it into two pieces) were passed! I can now stop worrying, haha. "	t5_2qh6o	True

So, I ultimately decided to go ahead and at least call the people and decide from there. Since the dog was just a bit flinchy, but obviously fed,and soft, and taken care of, me and my husband both figured she was missed. So, I called the cell number the vet's office gave me and ended up speaking with a lovely woman (a nurse who worked nights), who had been missing her dog Ellie. She came over to pick Ellie up and was all happiness and tears. I did mention that her collar with her rabies tag was much too small for her and she did say she'd been meaning to replace it, but time had gotten away from her.

Sure, Ellie would have been a welcome edition to my home, but I'm sure she'll be happy in her own."	t5_2qh6o	True

Back story: I was out walking my 3 dogs and seen your sad lost dog wandering across a busy street. I asked a few of the neighbors that were out, if they have ever seen the dog. Of course no-one in subdivision knows anyone. So, I leashed your dog, carried one of my dogs, and walked a mile back home. Once home, I gave your dog water and got it out of the heat. I then proceeded to call the number on its tag. Of course you do not answer the three times I call. So, I reverse number search your ass and find your address.

I leashed your dog and proceeded to walk it back to its house ( in blistering hot 90 degree weather) because I am an amazing person who did not want you to be sad your dog was missing and have to pay the 100 fee for dog impound. (As well as the fact that it is Friday and your dog would have been impounded and euthanized by Monday) because it is the weekend.
*Back to the story*
Of course, you come driving by and as soon as you get out of your car, your dog cowers like it is about to be beat to death. Between your nonchalant attitude ""oh yea, she got out"" and your dog that had up-to-this point not cowered in fear, (even when approached by 3 dogs), makes me want to egg your house.

1373915477.0	1icwt8	My new kitten. [uplifting]	Aoladari	125	30	23	"So about a week and a half ago we went to the Humane Society for a ""petting session"". We typically are the people who will pet all the cats, or try to socially interact with them when they are in the adoptions that PetSmart/PetCo do on the weekends. Well, long story short we ended up going home from the Humane Society with another cat. She has 3 legs, but is recovering from surgery nicely (which was 10 days before we got her, so ~20 days ago now).

I didn't want to ask too many questions where the amputation was concerned. I know our Humane Society can cut corners, and I just don't want to know. Considering that during the adoption 2 different stories popped up about her amputation, I just **don't want to know.** If I find out her original injury was cruelty I'll have a mission in life to kill some bastards.... anyway.

This past weekend, she was being observed by her new human overlords, (the interactions with the other two cats in the house have gone splendidly) and we saw her go to the box. For every step/or hop she took, she had a tiny ""mew"". So in the litter box, all you heard was rustling of litter and ""Mew, mew, mew, mew, mew, mew, mew."" It was like she was singing to herself ""This is how the litter is supposed to go before I squat, this is where I place my feet...."" you get the idea. The funny part is I'm not even sure she realized she was doing it.

So if you're having a bad day, imagine a 2 month old, 3 legged cat kitten ""singing"" to herself every time she's in the box.

*We had a rocky start with the other 2 cats, but she has since wrapped the Maine Coon with anger issues around her little paw. He's acting like he has been given the best toy in the world (it's self propelled!), and he is constantly by her side showing her things, and has even taken to cleaning her backside (a motherly duty to make really young kittens.... tinkle). Two days before this, he was hissing and running from her like he was on fire.*

1355895836.0	153fvc	When you see a 'damaged' dog play for the first time, suddenly becomes worth it	CMRescueAdvocate	116	24	33	"This is really true of any animal, but this specific instance is about a dog. I figured you all might appreciate hearing about it.

I run an animal rescue, and I specialize in animals that are special needs, elderly, and generally hard to adopt out due to behavior, health or whatever reason. But I admit I was not quite prepared for the latest rescue I got. I've had rescued dogs before, but none that were quite this psychologically scarred or with the particular behavior problems this one came with. 

We recently took in a solid black (one of the most unpopular, overlooked, and euthanized type of animal) dog formerly owned by an elderly woman who was losing her faculties. All I knew about the dog is that she was ""probably spayed"", and that she spent the last 8 months of her life chained up indoors and living in her own filth because none of the family would take the dogs and the owner didn't want her to get euthanized at a pound but no longer had the wherewithal to fully grasp the dog's dire need for a new home. I found out later she jumped around through a lot of homes, some with rowdy aggressive children.

When she came to us for the first few days she refused to eat. Up until recently she always acted like someone was going to harm or hit her, constantly nervous despite being very well socialized with humans of all types since a very young age by the second owner. She would regularly defecate and urinate in the house. The last part was incredibly frustrating as you can understand. Even my other rescues had come to me housebroken at least, they had other behavioral issues but voiding their bladder and bowels indoors was not one of them.

There were times I thought I might have to give her to another rescue, maybe one that had experience with puppy mill raids since she had common issues I've heard puppy mill rescues having. I thought she would never learn to trust us, she was afraid of women because of her past so I thought she would not trust me at all.

Skip forward to about a month ago. She played, really played, for the first time here, or probably ever really since her old owner didn't really play with her. I'd tried to engage her in play, even with her favorite toys, she acted scared and nervous so I did not push it. Then one day I just get down at her level and pat the ground and she comes over and starts pouncing playfully and runs to get a toy. Now she likes to pick up people's socks and run after them to get you to chase her and get them back. It's funny because some people might get annoyed with dogs doing this, but because of the fact that she used to never play and thought play time was something scary or that would cause her harm, it's heart warming. I actually cried, and I knew at that point, I could ""fix"" her.

She is also getting much better about the housebreaking issue. She has her own little dog sweater since it's winter to make going outside much warmer. We do have to crate her when we leave the house but she hasn't snuck off to potty indoors when we turn our backs in over 3 weeks (whereas she would do it quite regularly). I know crating will always have to be done even if we only had her, just to make sure she doesn't relapse, but just that she's made so much progress is great.

I normally do not like to keep animals that aren't highly unadoptable because the point of the rescue part is to place animals in forever homes. Although I do have a sanctuary for animals that just can't get adopted out, such as the human aggressive/fearful and even same species aggressive elderly rat I have, and the FLV+ cat I rescued off the streets. But this dog has grow quite attached to my family and my fiance, and the third owner is related to my fiance as well. I would feel bad if I put her in a home and she regressed back to not being housebroken and they brought her back because she has been through so many different homes, and that caused her to have separation anxiety. so we'll see what happens."	t5_2qh6o	True

Suddenly she got down and started making noises like she was going to be sick and threw up her dinner.  Now being a lab, sometimes she swallows a piece of chew toy, but it always comes back up and my wife thought that's what was the culprit.  As she went to clean up the mess, the dog went and sat at the landing of the stairs.  This was odd because usually if she got sick she would cower and tuck tail thinking that she did something wrong, but she just indifferently went and sat down, then laid down.  My wife called up to me, ""I think there's something wrong with Lani."" I came down the stairs and noticed she was tracking me with her eyes, but not lifting her head.  As I was checking her over, she stopped breathing.  We moved her to the living room floor and started CPR.  I wrapped her up and put her in the car, racing to the veterinary hospital while my wife continued compressions.  At the hospital they continued trying to revive her to no avail.  The DVM did an ultrasound to determine what caused the sudden crash and discovered a tumor on her heart that had ruptured and filled the sac around her heart with fluid.  There was nothing we could do.  

She was the perfect dog; sweet, playful, obedient, great with our toddler, never peed in the house, etc.  Now a large void sits where our Lei Lani used to be.  We have lost a member of the family.  I just wanted to share with you all as a reminder of how quickly these critters that make life a little brighter can disappear from our lives.  Please give your furry family members a hug and kiss on behalf of those of us who can't.

[Formatted version of Nugget's Story](http://nuggetthechicken.blogspot.com/2012/12/nugget-story-of-how-abused-chicken-was.html)


**Pecking Order: The story of Nugget, the chicken who never gave up**

Nugget grew up with 3 other chickens, Kung Pao, The Colonel, and Tandoori.
And when they were young, these birds never had a worry.

I never knew the origin of the phrase, ""pecking order"".
But the words came alive when watching chickens grow up in close quarters.

As the chickens matured, rough bullying started.
Our friend Jim, Nugget's first owner, was broken hearted.

Nugget was the target and they would peck, peck, peck.
Nugget never fought back, even with blood soaked feathers on her neck.

Nugget laid down motionless as if she wasn't there.
The chickens kept attacking her as if they didn't care.

Nugget could not defend herself so Jim looked for a new home.
Maybe one with nicer chickens that would leave her alone.

So we adopted Nugget from Jim and hoped for the best.
Would she fare better with us? That was the test.

Her new coop mates had names like Uggs, Puggs, and Sweets.
We hoped she wouldn't be the new target of their tweets.

Though her neighbors were different, the result was the same.
The chickens kept pecking at her as if it was a game.

We couldn't stand it and we built her an individual cage.
Nugget would have her own area where she could peacefully age.

She wouldn't be bothered when she wanted water or a meal.
And we hoped the wound on her neck would eventually heal.

After a few weeks we decided to let Nugget mingle.
We knew she was desperately lonely and feeling single.

But this time around Nugget seemed stronger.
We could leave her in the yard with other chickens for longer.

Nugget didn't socialize because she wasn't quite able.
But she would watch from a chair or up high on a table.

And when the chickens approached her to try to attack.
Nugget puffed herself up and would take a step back.

Everything went well for Nugget for a few weeks.
But we knew something was terribly wrong when we heard shouting from their beaks.

Somehow or another a dog had entered our yard.
And his target was the chicken who was most mentally scarred.

By the time we got outside we saw.
A mean dog running with Nugget firmly in its jaw.

My daughter cried and said why Nugget - she had lived the hardest life.
I watched in horror, completely stupefied and called my wife.

I put my daughter in the house and locked her in.
Then I searched for the dog who had attacked our chicken.

I found the dog with Nugget motionless by its side.
To be honest I didn't know what to do and I was terrified.

Suddenly an amazing thing happened that I didn't believe.
Nugget stood up and started running. But I was only partially relieved.

The dog tried to chase after Nugget but I kept him at bay.
I tried to give Nugget time to get away.

I searched all over the yard but Nugget was lost.
But I kept looking and I would find her at any cost.

I imagined finding her dead and my stomach sickened.
But to my surprise she was at the coop talking to the other chickens.

The chickens crowded around her wanting to hear how she survived.
Nugget had learned to play dead in order to stay alive.

All of the times she laid motionless and abused against her will, 
in one lucky moment was her life saving skill.

We put her in a box and then drove her to the vet.
They asked for her name. Embarrassed, we whispered, ""Nugget.""

The doctor gave her stitches and said Nugget would be fine.
How many lives would this chicken have ...  Nine?

When we brought her back home we locked her safely away.
So she could relax and rest for the rest of the day.

She wouldn't be bothered when she wanted water or a meal.
And we hoped the wounds from the dog would eventually heal.

After several weeks we let Nugget back out into the yard.
But this time the other chickens didn't make her life hard.

It seemed the other chickens were glad to have Nugget back.
And they were in awe of her for surviving the dog attack.

Nugget played with the other chickens during the day.
But retreated to her own coop at night to get away.

One day during a rain storm, her coop door was closed.
Nugget could not get in and had nowhere else to go.

Nugget went to the coop with the other chickens to stay warm.
She was alone at the bottom but she was safe from the storm.

In the morning we set Nugget free to play outside.
And we left her private coop door open to let her decide.

The next evening Nugget stayed with the other chickens again.
She slept on the second level and was fitting in with the other hens!

On the third night after the storm we looked in the coop.
Nugget had reserved the most coveted top stoop!

From then on Nugget lived with the rest of the flock.
Amazingly she was no longer the one to be mocked.

It was as if the other chickens now respected her.
And Nugget had a new-found confidence we never expected in her.

1312768343.0	jbzdo	My little man. Put down today at 7 months old.	ashsauce	107	13	51	"What do you do when someone you love is severely sick?
I only knew him for Seven months.
When I first saw him he was a little fur-ball.  He was so cute running around the pen dashing at you filling your heart with his sweet nature. We instantly fell in love with him, filled out the paper work and took him home.
It seemed to us he grew bigger every day. He was our “Big boy” he was supposed to be 200 pounds someday!
At first we thought he was just hard to house train, but it then became apparent that something was wrong when he couldn’t even hold it in while he was in his cage.
He was taken to the vet and they suspected it being diabetes. We were shocked, how could our little man have that? We did the “water tests”, he was drinking more then 13 cups a day. It was sure to be just Diabetes.
Months went on and we dealt with his “Diabetes” constantly showering with him, giving him water, cleaning up all of his “water”, buying rolls of paper towel like no tomorrow.
Then it was time for him to get neutered, they did pre-surgical blood work to make sure everything was ok.
But it wasn’t.

The test showed his liver enzymes were way too high. We had him tested for quite a few different diseases, all negative. So it was down to a few possible things; a Parasitic Fluke, Hepatitis, or a liver shunt. Every option was horrific. We decided to treat for the liver shunt as it was the least expensive thing and hopefully “easiest” to treat. Other options were to have ultrasounds done to his liver to confirm a shunt, where then the only possible treatments were medication his whole life or a surgery that can only be done at the University of Saskatoon which was thousands of dollars which he would be hospitalized and would need continuous vet visits to ensure that he would be progressing. 
He was on antibiotics and Lactulose, and his new vegetarian diet. For the first few days he was responding really well to the therapy. He didn’t seem as lethargic; he was walking around, and was even starting to play again!
He started to get sick again. The medication was no longer working. More blood tests were done.
They showed his body was now attacking his Red Blood Cells. His RBC was very low, and he was severely Dehydrated and now Anemic. Even if it was a Shunt and we had the means to get the surgery done we couldn’t because of the anemia. More needles, subcutaneous injection of fluids for his dehydration and a new set of medications to help prevent his body from attacking itself.
Only it didn’t work.
His eyes, ears and gums all yellow. His liver was not working and he now had severe jaundice. His body attacking itself and now he was poisoned, he was having a very hard time breathing and it was a struggle to just look at him. I held him that night, felt his fur, trying to make sure he was ok, making sure he was still breathing.
I woke up to him howling. I was relieved he must be better if he’s barking. I got up to find his kennel covered in vomit.  We took him out washed his paws and set the kennel bottom outside. I watched him sleep, he was struggling.
A little while later he vomited again, this time it was black. Immediately we knew something was very wrong. We called a vet and made an appointment, got him in the car and left.
We waited about an hour for the Veterinarian. After he examined him and we showed him the medications and filled him in about his medical history he gave us two options.
1.	Subcutaneous fluids for the dehydration and Zantac injection to stop him from puking. He was bleeding in his stomach from a peptic ulcer caused by the medications that’s why his vomit had been black. He would continue to bleed internally, but it would ease his stomach until we could get him to his regular vet.
2.	Blood transfusion. He would need one every day for at least three days. It wasn’t guaranteed to work because his body was already destroying his RBC’s so it would also most likely reject the donor cells. It was also a very lengthy and expensive procedure.
I stared at him. He was panting on the ground, nonresponsive as the Doctor continued to look at his eyes and gums. We realized the only real option.
We were all in the room, for how long I’m not sure. Petting him, holding him, giving our last bit of love that we could. 
Second last needle; to sedate him. He was fully sedated after 10 to 15 minutes. We were all there for him.
It was the last needle and shortly thereafter his last breath, and most importantly no more suffering.
We love you Moose.


Edit: I wanted to share more pictures of him, he was so darling. Thank you all SO much for the support! It's really helping me deal with the loss. Thank you again.

1375913912.0	1jwy13	[UPDATE] I asked r/pets for advice concerning my 23 year-old cat... was I considering letting her go for her or me? Here's my update.	LyingLouise	106	19	23	"[Here's a link to the original post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1jpren/am_i_putting_my_23_yearold_cat_down_for_myself_or/)

First, a huge thanks to the r/pets community - you guys were so kind and thoughtful with your replies and I valued each one.

I took her to the vet once again, kind of desperate to just be told bluntly one way or the other if they thought she should be put down. The vet seemed really concerned just by looking at her. He said he suspected renal failure - he said she was severely dehydrated and apparently weighed less than a four week-old kitten he'd weighed earlier that day. I asked him straight up, ""if she was your cat, what would you do?"" He said he'd put her down.

That was enough for me and helped me with the guilt I felt about having her put down because she'd become 'hard work'. I suggested having one more week with her, but he actually said he wouldn't leave it a week in her condition. Which really shocked me, I thought she might have a few months left in her, if I pushed it.

So she's booked in for Friday and I'm heartbroken, but in a way relieved because a decision has finally been reached. Now I'm looking at her through fresh eyes I've suddenly realised how weak and frail she is. I do think it's time.

I hope this update was okay with the mods, as it is technically about pet loss, I guess. Anyway, [here's a picture](http://imgur.com/a/cdM0C) of the girl in question... my gorgeous Flo (bonus pic of the dog shaking his head!) "	t5_2qh6o	True

At 10, I realize he hasn't barked to come in, like always.  

Discovered his absence, and went ballistic.  I am not a dog person (former letter carrier with two rather bad encounters with dogs), but this one was rescued, and rather charming in his own less than intelligent manner.  

So, I drive the surrounding area calling him, cursing and grumbling.

Then it hits me.....Craig's List! Post about him, especially that he is epileptic and in need of medicine. I figure its worth it.

I called my wife and as I do my inbox on my comp chimes three times.  

It's been 10 minutes and 2 people tell me to read the post 2 above mine.  The third is the author of the post, saying call me, I have a tired, dirty, non smart puffball.

Had him back 30 minutes from noticing him gone.

1353947391.0	13tg5c	So my cat decided to eat some raw pizza dough	annoyingrob	112	22	16	"Two nights ago my fiancée and I decided to make some pizza for dinner. We made the dough, wrapped it lightly in saran wrap on the counter, and went out to the store to get some ingredients while letting the dough rise. This isn't uncommon, we've done it many times and the cat has no interest in the dough. We come back about 45 minutes later, and the dough is missing. Confused, we start looking aroung. After some searching, we find that he's carried the whole ball of dough half-way up the stairs to the landing where he decided to have a snack. Quite am impressive feat I must say. We couldn't help but laugh at it.

It was pretty funny, he acted totally normal until he saw that we found the dough, then he immediately ran away to hide. We locked him in the bedroom for a few minutes as punishment, but I think the real punishment was a big ball of yeasty goodness now going to town in his stomach. 

Long story short, he was a very gassy kitty for the rest of the evening, and not enjoying it at all. I've never seen a cat burping before, it was hilarious. I think he learned his lesson, and so have we. Don't assume it's something the cat doesn't want to eat.


Before anyone goes an jumps on my back about this, yes I called the vet after he ate it to make sure that he would be ok. The vet said give him lots of water, and watch him to make sure he doesn't get the runs, or get super lethargic.  "	t5_2qh6o	True

Loki, the one on the left, was listed as a 6-year-old Domestic Medium Hair, and Freyr was listed as a 3-5-year-old Maine Coon. They both came from the same hoarder, so they may be related.
___________________________________________________________________________

**The first few months**

They had been up for adoption for a month before I got them, but were still pretty sick. [Loki](http://imgur.com/WhWTbD1) had to have 12 teeth pulled because they were so rotten, and [Freyr](http://imgur.com/zSUEJfM) couldn't really open his eyes - plus they were both sneezy, skinny, and very, very sleepy. [Here's](http://imgur.com/TNHFDqY) a picture after about a month out of the shelter, where Freyr is looking pretty good, but Loki is still looking very skinny (it was tough to get him to eat, until I switched to softening up his dry food and warming his wet food). Around this time, we got a different age estimate from a regular vet - she guessed around 8 years old for Freyr and ""possibly much older"" for Loki. It was really tough to hear that...

A few months later, though, they started to look much better! Obviously it's good that I have both of them, since they're [best friends](http://imgur.com/IYnA3Xm). [Loki's](http://imgur.com/2J3hWro) fur had started to grow back in, and [Freyr](http://imgur.com/h93MPky) could sort-of open his eyes at this point (it took surgery to get them better than that). Their age was estimated at this point to be around 5-6 years old, but probably not much over 7. 

_____________________________________________________________________________
**Health Problems**

There are problems with adopting sick shelter cats - you have to be prepared for the possibility of several vet visits and a lot of expense. After trying several ophthalmic creams for Freyr (and almost giving up on him ever being better), the regular vet referred him to an ophthalmologist for surgery - the fur from his cheeks was scratching his corneas, and would possibly cause him to go blind. Here he is [before](http://i.imgur.com/LV4nU.jpg) the surgery, [a few days after](http://i.imgur.com/yQwak.jpg), and [finally able to open his eyes!](http://i.imgur.com/Bzv41.jpg). The total cost was around $2k for the surgery.

Loki had his own health issues that are still being worked on. He seems to have an auto-immune disease that causes his nailbeds to be chronically inflamed and infected, but it's being kept under control with medication. No pictures of that, because it's gross.

The point here is that you have to have time/money to help sick kitties turn into happy kitties. These guys are easy and can be left alone, but some people have disabled cats that cannot. Know how much money/effort you are willing to put in before adopting!

________________________________________________________________________
**Finally looking good!**

At this point, around 2.5 years after getting them, Freyr has gone up from 11 lbs to a svelte 14 lbs. He is a [BIG](http://imgur.com/LNzuNQa) cat. Loki is a bit smaller, and went from 9 pounds lbs to 12.5 lbs. Loki wants to be a [model](http://imgur.com/hEjSi95), and is now [very very fluffy](http://imgur.com/BWFCVu5). And I was pretty excited to finally see [Freyr's eye color](http://imgur.com/wUyyQsC), but he typically just spends most of his time sleeping.

As for personality, they're obnoxious food-stealers, which is probably left over from their previous starvation and made worse by my lack of strict parenting. Meal time seems to change their personalities, and I definitely could never leave dry food out because they eat fast enough to make themselves sick. Outside of meals, they're both very laid-back and loving. I have two cats on top of me most nights (except when there are new guests over - then they're so excited for affection from a new person that they don't pay attention to me!). As I'm typing this, they're both curled up in little balls on the couch with me. They almost never like to be alone.

And yes, they're still [best friends](http://imgur.com/Vdj7XJl)!"	t5_2qh6o	True

We bring the dog back into house.

He looks where the couch WAS! He backs up and takes a flying leap to land on the couch.

He couldn't breath, was crying out in fear and agony, and suffering from cardiac arrest. He didn't make it to the vet, and died while I was driving 100 mph down the highway. Not wanting to accept his silence as what I knew it was, I kept driving. We got to the vet, but there was nothing left to do. I had the veterinarian do a physical examination, and his diagnosis was that he was born with a congenital heart disease. His heart stopped working properly, it could no longer pump blood to his body and fluid was pumping into his heart. The most common congenital heart problems effect the heart valves and the septum and usually causes heart failure by 10 months of age. We didn't get an autopsy, so the exact type of heart disease is undetermined. The veterinarian expressed that when you don't know the parents, or the breed background of a rescued animal, the risk of adopting a pet with a congenital disease is great. The moral of this story redditors is if you find a kitten under a car or in your backyard or adopt it from a shelter, please please when you take them to the vet to get them spayed/neutered and vaccinated ask your vet about the risk of congenital heart defects and if they could xray and sonogram your new kittens chest and lungs. You don't wanna have to say goodbye to your cat that way at such a young age.
Thank you for reading, here is a picture of the most wonderful, sweetest cat in the world. [Hemingway](http://i.imgur.com/dbo7L.jpg)

EDIT: 
There's no need to spend thousands of dollars on medical tests! Or to get your cat checked for every possible aliment ""just in case."" Heart defects are rare but serious, and are hardly ever tested for. Tests to determine congenital defects are costly, information is free. Just ask your vet about possible signs/symptoms.

LETTER FROM A SHELTER MANAGER:
Author Unknown

""I think our society needs a huge ""Wake-up"" call. ...As a shelter manager, I am going to share a little insight with you all...a view from the inside if you will. First off, all of you people who have ever surrendered a pet to a shelter or humane society should be made to work in the ""back"" of an animal shelter for ... See Morejust ... See Moreone day. Maybe if you saw the life drain from a few sad, lost, confused eyes, you would stop flagging the ads on craigslist and help these animals find homes. That puppy you just bought will most likely end up in my shelter when it's not a cute little puppy anymore. Just so you know there's a 90% chance that dog will never walk out of the shelter it's dumped at? Purebred or not! About 25% of all of the dogs that are ""owner surrenders"" or ""strays"", that come into a shelter are purebred dogs.

The most common excuses: ""We are moving and we can't take our dog (or cat)."" Really? Where are you moving too that doesn't allow pets? Or they say ""The dog got bigger than we thought it would"". How big did you think a German Shepherd would get? ""We don't have time for her"". Really? I work a 10-12 hour day and still have time for my 6 dogs! ""She's tearing up our yard"". How about making her a part of your family? They always tell me ""We just don't want to have to stress about finding a place for her we know she'll get adopted, she's a good dog"".

Odds are your pet won't get adopted &amp; how stressful do you think being in a shelter is? Well, let me tell you, your pet has 72 hours to find a new family from the moment you drop it off. Sometimes a little longer if the shelter isn't full and your dog manages to stay completely healthy. If it sniffles, it dies. Your pet will be confined to a small run/kennel in a room with other barking or crying animals. It will have to relieve itself where it eats and sleeps. It will be depressed and it will cry constantly for the family that abandoned it. If your pet is lucky, I will have enough volunteers in that day to take him/her for a walk. If I don't, your pet won't get any attention besides having a bowl of food slid under the kennel door and the waste sprayed out of its pen with a high-powered hose. If your dog is big, black or any of the ""Bully"" breeds (pit bull, rottie, mastiff, etc) it was pretty much dead when you walked it through the front door. Those dogs just don't get adopted. It doesn't matter how 'sweet' or 'well behaved' they are.

If your dog doesn't get adopted within its 72 hours and the shelter is full, it will be destroyed. If the shelter isn't full and your dog is good enough, and of a desirable enough breed it may get a stay of execution, but not for long . Most dogs get very kennel protective after about a week and are destroyed for showing aggression. Even the sweetest dogs will turn in this environment. If your pet makes it over all of those hurdles chances are it will get kennel cough or an upper respiratory infection and will be destroyed because the shelter gets paid a fee to euthanize each animal and making money is better than spending money to take this animal to the vet.

Here's a little euthanasia 101 for those of you that have never witnessed a perfectly healthy, scared animal being ""put-down"". First, your pet will be taken from its kennel on a leash. They always look like they think they are going for a walk happy, wagging their tails. Until they get to ""The Room"", every one of them freaks out and puts on the brakes when we get to the door. It must smell like death or they can feel the sad souls that are left in there, it's strange, but it happens with every one of them. Your dog or cat will be restrained, held down by 1 or 2 shelter workers depending on the size and how freaked out they are. Then a shelter worker who we call a euthanasia tech (not a vet) find a vein in the front leg and inject a lethal dose of the ""pink stuff"". Hopefully your pet doesn't panic from being restrained and jerk. I've seen the needles tear out of a leg and been covered with the resulting blood and been deafened by the yelps and screams. They all don't just ""go to sleep"", sometimes they spasm for a while, gasp for air and defecate on themselves. You see shelters are trying to make money to pay employee pay checks and don't forget the board of directors needs to be paid too, so we don't spend our funds to tranquilize the animal before injecting them with the lethal drug, we just put the burning lethal drug in the vein and let them suffer until dead. If it were not a ""making money issue"" and we had to have a licensed vet do this procedure, the animal would be sedated or tranquilized and then euthanized, but to do this procedure correctly would cost more money so we do not follow what is right for the animal, we just follow what is the fastest way we can make a dollar. Shelters do not have to have a vet perform their euthanasia's so even if it takes our employee 50 pokes with a needle and 3 hours to get the vein that is what we do. Making money is the issue here not loosing money.

When it all ends, your pets corpse will be stacked like firewood in a large freezer in the back with all of the other animals that were killed waiting to be picked up like garbage. What happens next? Cremated? Taken to the dump? Rendered into pet food? Or used for the schools to dissect and experiment on? You'll never know and it probably won't even cross your mind. It was just an animal and you can always buy another one, right!

I hope that those of you who still have a beating heart and have read this are bawling your eyes out and can't get the pictures out of your head, I deal with this everyday. I hate my job, I hate that it exists &amp; I hate that it will always be there unless you people make some changes and start educating the public. Do research, do your homework, and know exactly what you are getting into before getting a pet. These shelters and humane societies exist because people just do not care about animals anymore. Animals were not intended to be disposable but somehow that is what they are these days. Animal shelters are an easy way out when you get tired of your dog (or cat), and breeders are the ones blamed for this. Animal shelters and rescue organizations are making a hefty profit by keeping this misconception going.

Between 9 and 11 MILLION animals die every year in shelters and only you - as a pet owner can stop it. I just hope I maybe changed one persons mind about taking their dog to a shelter, a humane society, or buying a dog without researching. For those of you that care--- please repost this to at least one other craiglist in another city/state. Let's see if we can get this all around the US and have an impact.
PROMISE A FUTURE - and DON'T FAIL THEM! PETS ARE FOR A LIFETIME!!!

Best I can figure is that she got in through a window in my basement that was broken almost a month ago, and subsisted on some mice that came in too.  She crawled out into the open, and was crying, but otherwise unable to move.  Some water seems to have helped, but she's still very weak.  Some quick pictures I took... http://www.flickr.com/photos/vax-o-matic/sets/72157625370978827/

Update:
It's apparently a girl, and I've named her ""Lucky.""  The vet said that she's older, her temperature is critically low, and she's seriously dehydration. Her neck seems to be bothering her, but we're not sure why yet. She's getting warmed up and an iv overnight to try to re-hydrate, and they're still running some bloodwork. I'm sticking around for an hour or so to see how things go. 

Update 2:
After about an hour, her temperature is going back up to where it's supposed to be, and they're trying to fix her electrolytes while they hydrate her.  She still has a strong aversion to putting her head up - the doc thinks that she may have a sore neck, but isn't sure why, and will get some x-rays after she stabilizes a bit.  She's staying overnight on IV in the kitty-ICU, and I should get a call in the morning on her status.

Update 3 (next morning):
Got a call saying that she's up and moving in her cage, doing much better than last night. She has an enlarged thyroid, which is probably treatable. I'm keeping her at the vet at least until tonight to see if she gets better. She also has started eating now. 

Update 4 (night 2):
Went and saw her in the kitty ICU.  she's moving around somewhat, but still isn't able to walk.  They have a tube down her nose to help feed her, an IV, and a collar to keep her from pulling out the feeding tube.  She looks a lot healthier now, they've cleaned her up a bit.  They're hoping in 24 hrs her sodium levels will be back to normal.  She is front-declawed, so she must have been someone's pet at some point - they haven't checked her for a chip yet, I think because they're more concerned about fixing her other problems.  Oh, and they think she's about 5 years old.
Pic from her in a cage in the ICU: http://www.flickr.com/photos/vax-o-matic/5222632558/

Update 5 (2nd day after finding her):
Got a call from the vet.  Her electrolytes are back to normal, and she's eating, but still on the feeding tube for now.  She may have some neurological damage from not having eaten for so long - also may just be vitamin deficiency.  She's having an adominal ultrasound to look for suspected kidney/intestinal problem.  I'm going to go see her again tonight, and maybe will be able to consider taking her home.

Update 6: (3rd evening after finding her):
Talked to the vet some more. Her pupils are less dilated, and she's showing signs of being able to see, so hopefully no neuro problems.  She was finally scanned for a microchip, but they didn't find one in her.  She's steadily getting better, and they're going to focus on getting her better so that I can take her home.  She's a bit anemic though - dropping red blood cell count, so they are going to give her a blood transfusion.  She's showing some interest in eating, and drinking more on her own.  I'm going to see her again in the morning.

Update 7: (next morning):
The transfusion appears to have worked, and her red blood cell is back up, but she's still not eating.  The neurology dept offered to do a free consultation - she appears to have coordination problem, and over the first few days had ""episodes"" (the vet couldn't come up with a better word) which are similar to what a cat goes through before going into cardiac arrest, though it's been over a day since the last one, and she hasn't had any problems with her vital signs after these.  Still the vet says that she's ""doing good"", just recovering slowly.  I hate to think of it this way, but I hope she gets good enough so that I can take her home soon, not just for her sake, but also for my bank account's sake. :("	t5_2qh6o	True

College kids always fucking do this and then can’t afford BASIC veterinary care and don’t have nearly enough time to properly raise, train or love a puppy/kitten. I can tell you how this story will end: your “pet” will find itself severely neglected, living with your parents, or back in the shelter. Good work.

IF YOU OWN A PUPPY: Congratulations! Now don’t fuck it up by parading it around while it’s still 10 weeks old! Your puppy should not go on neighborhood walks, to public areas or ANY dog parks until FULLY vaccinated. The earliest this could possibly be, depending on your state, is at 4 months. If your puppy is less than 4 months old, confine their world to your home, puppy classes, and private socialization with dogs and owners you know well. Strutting around with your puppy before it is protected makes you a giant fucking tool and I hope you have the money to treat it when it contracts parvo.

IF YOU OWN A DOG: Unless you are an experienced breeder with the necessary time and resources, SPAY AND NEUTER YOUR GOD DAMN PETS. I don’t give a crap how amazing you think your dog is and how you “think you want to breed it”, YOU ARE NOT A BREEDER and you don’t know what the hell you’re talking about. And guys: the excuse that you don’t want to castrate your male dog because you yourself wouldn’t want to be castrated is RE-TAR-DED. Seriously, all that says to me is that you have a tiny dick, and marble-sized balls.

IF YOU OWN A SMALL DOG: Don’t feed it fucking table scraps. I don’t give a shit how much your dog begs and gives you that wide-eyed, sad look. You’re going to feel a whole lot worse when you have to hospitalize them for pancreatitis/HGE, than if you just ignore their begging. If you reward bad behavior, you better believe they’ll repeat it.

IF YOU ARE A HUMAN BEING: Don’t be a douche bag and ignore signs that your animal is sick until Friday at 5pm, or the day before you are about to go on your fucking vacation. Luckily for you, your vet will most likely have sympathy for your animal and squeeze you in somewhere in their jam-packed schedule, all while secretly hating your guts and wishing you many nights of blow-out diarrhea. Way to take advantage of people trying to care for animals. 
Fight the urge to accuse your vet of being money-hungry. While it is true that veterinarian offices are BUSINESSES and need to make money in order to function, most vets genuinely want to help your pet and are only doing what they think is best. Finding out what is wrong with your animal is not a guessing game; your vet cannot treat without knowing what to treat for. And unfortunately both steps cost money. If you are surprised by this, you should not own an animal.

And for fuck’s sake, follow your vet’s advice. If this doesn’t work out for whatever reason, find another doctor. Your vet probably won’t miss you.

TL;DR: If you are a student, a giant tool or an idiot, don’t get a pet. You aren’t doing them any favors bringing them into your shitty life if you can’t care for them.

May 2006 - March 2011

I miss him so much.
My wife and i got him when we were engaged.

I took him in on Saturday because he seemed to have had some weight loss and wasn't pooping as much this past week. Still had his full appetite, wagging his tail, playing, etc. Come to find his anal glands were swollen and were preventing him from going to the bathroom. The vet said it probably was causing him pain. Even during this visit he kept getting treats and seemed fine. We go home.

The next morning (Sunday) i felt him walking over my feet and shot up really fast to check on him. He had thrown up all over the bed (at least 5 times and it was all dark brown). So i got up and called the vet, they were closed but i knew they opened in 45 minutes. So i got ready to go. At this point he has thrown up at least another 3 times. I live in NYC so we took the bus, and then i had to walk a few blocks. He threw up on the bus too. Finally at the vet, they took us back immediately and they wanted to keep him overnight and watch him. After talking with them they thought it was pancreatitis. So after spending half of the day there, they took him back for the IV and meds, etc. This was the last time i would see him. They called that evneing a few times just keeping me updated. He had stopped throwing up and even was walking around and wagging his tail again.

The next morning (Monday) i awaited the vets call and they asked if I could come in and see if he would perk up when seeing me. After squaring things away at work I left and took the train to the vet. Once there I waiting in the lobby and down the hall I saw some people start acting frantic and then the door shut. My heart sank and I had an awful feeling all over me. They took me back and told me. He was doing ok and then all of a sudden his tongue had turned blue and they did CPR. He didn't make it. It was a very aggressive acute pancreatitis. My puppy passed away right when i had gotten there and was waiting in the lobby. It's like he was just trying to wait until I could get there.

I know we didn't do anything wrong and there was nothing the vet did wrong. Life just happens... and it just takes time to heal. He is in a better place and not hurting anymore. I personally believe I will see him again one day.

Whatever you do, always take your pets in for yearly check ups and do whatever it takes. It is worth it.

**Part 1/2**

I found [Dodger](http://imgur.com/g42xy.jpg) in 1999, a few months after I had graduated from college and moved to Los Angeles.  I was working on Sunset Blvd and one afternoon I saw a small, black dog running in and out of traffic. A few people were watching him dodge the cars that whizzed through the intersection, gasping in fear, but no one was trying to help.  I don’t know why, but I ran into traffic to try to grab him.  He was not interested in being caught and pretty soon the chase was on.  At least in his efforts to escape me he got out of the street and onto the sidewalk.

I chased him through the streets of Hollywood for at least 30 minutes.  Every time I thought I had him he slipped away.  At one point, I gave up and turned around to go back to work.  I walked about ten steps before something in me said, “No - you can’t give up now,” and I resumed running.  Finally, he ran down a blocked side street where a man with a walkie-talkie stopped me from following.  

“You can’t come in here,” he said.  “They’re filming up there.”  

“I’m trying to catch that dog!” I said, pointing to the small figure trotting away from us.

“A dog?” said the security guard.  “Let me see if we can grab him.”  He got on his walkie and his counterpart at the other end of the street moved to head off the only exit.  We cornered the dog between us and he finally stopped running.  I hooked a finger underneath his collar and knelt to look him in the eye. *You got me*, he seemed to say, and sighed.

“You should name that dog Lucky,” said the first security guard.

“No,” I said, “His name is Dodger.”

I tried to find Dodger’s owner.  I put up flyers in the neighborhood and put notices in the paper.  I called local shelters to see if anyone was looking for a dog matching his description.  He had a collar but no tags, and the vet didn’t find a microchip.  Someone cared enough about him once to put that collar on him, but he had long since outgrown it.  The vet couldn’t estimate how long he’d been on the street, but did estimate his overall age to be about two years.

Part of me wasn’t sorry that Dodger’s original owner never turned up.  From the moment I knelt down and looked him in the eye, something clicked and I knew we were going to be companions.  He slept under my desk at work that afternoon, worn out and content to find a place to rest. I gave him a bath that night at home, and after I toweled him off he rolled onto his back and put his head in my lap while his tail thumped the floor.  It was the only time he ever did that, and I know he was expressing his gratitude.  He slept on the foot of my bed that night and every night afterwards for the next 11 years.

Dodger’s street origins were apparent in many of his behaviors.  He had massive separation anxiety and would cry piteously if I as much as shut the bathroom door between us.  Once we went to visit my husband’s aunt and uncle and had to keep Dodger in the garage for the night.  When we woke up the next morning we had to buy them a new door - he had destroyed it trying to get back inside to me.  On the other hand, he was also still inclined to bolt out the front door if we weren’t careful, and I reprised our initial chase scene a few times before he finally settled down.  On a trip to Mississippi he took off after some rabbits into the woods and for a few terrified moments I thought I would never see him again.  He came bounding back to me, though, immensely pleased with himself. He also snuck food given any opportunity to do so.  We used to keep apples on a low,open shelf in the kitchen, and one day we watched in amazement as he dug up and ate an apple he had stashed in a potted plant in the living room.

I loved Dodger with all my heart, but even I knew that he was not a sweet dog.  He was obstinate, independent and mistrustful.  He resisted cuddling or holding of any kind.  While he was tightly bonded to me, he merely tolerated  the other people in my life - my brother, my boyfriend (and eventually my husband), my housemates.  My mom and I were not on great terms at the time, and he warmed my heart when he barked ferociously at her during their first meeting.  He hated being manhandled by anyone, especially the vet.  I had to muzzle him for every trip or else he would growl and snap the second the vet put her hands on him.  He was also racist at first, which was a real problem since one of my housemates was an African-American man.  Luckily my housemate was a patient animal lover.  He cured Dodger’s racism by putting his dinner plate on the floor every night for Dodger to eat the scraps.

He was a fierce guard dog.  Although he only weighed 25 pounds, his bark was deep and loud, and from the other side of a door you expected to be met with a dog three or four times his size.  He was deeply suspicious of delivery people and workers of all kinds.  If we didn’t shut him up in the bedroom, he would follow the plumber or handyman around our apartment, legs stiff, head down, and growling low the whole time.  He hated the mailman so much that we had to put plexiglass over the front window - he actually broke a window pane once by pounding his front legs against it. When we finally moved out of that apartment we had to rebuild the window sill with putty from all the damage he had done to it over the years.

His quirks were many.  He would “stalk” his water bowl, walking in slow motion to it and not resuming his regular speed until he’d had a drink.  Sometimes we would put a treat on top of his food just to watch him eat around it, finishing all of his regular food before eating the treat last like a doggy dessert.  He was finicky about eating anything from our hands as if the smell of human turned his stomach, yet he would gobble up moldy bread on the sidewalk when we took him for walks.  He also loved to eat paper, and would munch straight from the toilet paper roll if we left it in reach.  He would often lie down with his paws crossed, looking like a regal dog in repose.  He walked well on leash and never seemed to get tangled up with anything.  If he walked around a signpost or tree, he was able to backtrack out of it.  If the leash went between his front and rear legs, he would do a little handstand and swing his rear legs over it to get clear.

One time Dodger had a pinched nerve in his back that caused him tremendous pain.  It was at night, so we took him to a 24-hour emergency vet to find out what was going on. They prescribed a pain reliever until we could get him to our regular vet the next day.  The pain reliever worked, but he still had a lot of difficulty walking.  He would stagger a few steps, sway in place, and then stagger a few more.  When we took him to our regular vet the next day, she saw his behavior and checked the pain medication prescription.  They had given our little guy a dosage appropriate to a St. Bernard.  The vet had no idea how he was even conscious, much less walking.  He was just that stubborn - he refused to go down.

Over time, Dodger settled down and mellowed out.  He stopped trying to run out the door every time we opened it.  He lost his separation anxiety.  He ate without being frantic and slept deeply and untroubled.  He became friendlier with other people (though he never did warm up to the vet).  I believe he finally felt secure. When we sat on the couch at night, he would turn in circles next to me before settling down with a *thump*, his paw draped over my leg.  *Don’t for one second believe that I’m your dog*, he seemed to say.  *You are my person*."	t5_2qh6o	True
