1341528648.0	w3ls6	A word from your moderator	dubiousbro	190	15	59	"I predict that this may turn out to be a somewhat unpopular post, but so be it.

Over the last few months, I've been getting a lot of messages suggesting that I'm not doing my job. It's especially unpleasant to receive messages giving me an ultimatum: appoint another mod or we'll take over the subreddit via r/redditrequest. Despite what it may seem on the surface, I still actively monitor the moderation queue here. 

I've said it before and I'll say it again: 

* real reports are few and far between because this community is very well behaved
* legitimate submissions rarely ever get caught in the spam filter
* actual spam is rarely posted, and even if it is, I don't mind just letting the community downvote it appropriately

There is barely a need for one moderator, so I see no reason to add more.

Aside from this, your other big concern is probably flair. There have been a few vocal users who have strongly advocated for implementing flair on this subreddit. I've waffled on this issue in the past, and I appreciate anybody who's tried to make relevant Katawa Shoujo flair, but let me say it explicitly right now: as of this moment in time, I have no plans to implement flair on r/katawashoujo. I've always preferred a clean and simple layout to subreddits, and this is one is no exception. It's been a community for approximately 6 months now and has been running perfectly without flair. I'm sure there will be plenty of you who will disagree with this decision, but I'll say it one more time: **as of this moment in time, I have no plans to implement flair on r/katawashoujo.**

Thanks for reading."	t5_2tb50	True

This morning i have a guest that comes in by himself (age looked to be around 20 something) and he had on a shirt that no lie had that heart with the band-aid logo on it. at first i wasn't sure if it was a coincidence or legit so i didn't mention it but when he started ordering and it got to the part where i had to ask if he wanted bacon, he says yeah, and i reply ""so do you want that bacon extra Hanako?"" guy does a double take and i think i was mistaken, but then he just busts out laughing...only problem was he was drinking from his glass at the time. problem was he started choking...really bad. problem was he passed out and one ambulance later im feeling like the worst guy in the world. Ill never know if that shirt was legit or a coincidence though.

tl;dr- sent a guy straight to Yamaku high after causing him to choke so hard on water that he passed out.

-also yeah this really happened, freaked the mess out of me for a bit.

-first post ever on reddit. Im sorry if my storytelling is bad.

UPDATE- When the guy left in the ambulance he seemed to be doing fine. They were just taking him to the emergency room just to make sure there wasn't a bigger problem at hand. i just got off of work today though and i made sure to ask my manager if he heard anything about that guy. He said he got in contact with him and offered him a good sized gift-card (probably out of fear, in case of a lawsuit) and also invited him to come back anytime. So maybe ill see him again? we can only hope."	t5_2tb50	True

1333984097.0	s0ux4	I met a blind person in Boston this weekend	Wolvenfire86	116	10	8	"He stopped me and asked if I could point him in the direction of a Starbucks. How he got to the busy heart of Boston by himself, I still can’t figure out. Even more impressive, he came from the suburbs north of Boston but he was but two blocks away from his destination.

I offered to help him get to his location since I had the time and wanted to help. Go figure, [*I* got lost and *he* told me the correct way to go.] (http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3opii2/)

He took my arm as we traveled, talked a little as I helped him maneuver around the streets. He was really interesting and it was relaxing to be in his presence. He said such nice things, as paced and patiently as Lilly.

People don’t just stop and talk to anymore, not like that. Isn’t that sad? That there are such interesting people out there…but we don’t stop to get to know them. Not really.

I think I was with him for about twenty minutes. I don’t know if I would have reacted as calmly in this chance encounter if not for KS.

The meeting wasn’t super special or world changing or newspaper-worthy…I don’t even know why I am telling you guys this. It just felt nice to meet a delightful stranger. Someone needed a little bit of help and I didn’t ignore that person. That meant something. Maybe it meant more to me and it did to him. He’s probably forgotten about me already. But that doesn’t matter. That wasn’t the point.

I didn’t feel an ounce of pity or awkwardness, and after about 30 seconds I forgot that he was blind. He was just a person like me.

So I guess here is another post thanking KS for making me a better person."	t5_2tb50	True

Rin - http://shimmie.katawa-shoujo.com/post/view/2627
Her child is maybe the most adorable among the five pictures, although she's just a ""clone"" of her - wonder if Hisao's the father? A good thing about KS is that choosing a girl doesn't mean the others won't find happiness witout Hisao.

Shizune - http://shimmie.katawa-shoujo.com/post/view/2628
She looks great with a ponytail. It's also cute that you cannot really tell whether the child is male or female - keep in mind Hideaki's the uncle...

Lilly - http://shimmie.katawa-shoujo.com/post/view/2629
There's speculation int he comments on whether the child is blind liker her mother. If that was the case, well, the Satou genepool would be a troubled one - after all, two siblings had each a daughter, born with a disability, in the space of a few months...

Hanako - http://shimmie.katawa-shoujo.com/post/view/2630
The worst of the sketches, unfortunately. On top of appearing very rushed compared to the others, the child is creepy with that hair, dress and little high heels shoes (!) that make her look like a doll - if it isn't in fact a doll...

The first time I heard of the game was in the end of 2009. When I finally end the demo I was impressed for the story, the art, the music but the most shocking element of the game was the feelings in it.

Probably some of you never meet a blind person before, or maybe had contact with somebody with a missing limb. Maybe you never shared something with a deaf.

Sometimes looks like they hide from an hostile society, but more probably we don't wanna see them, after all you can't understand how they feel or maybe you don't know how to treat them but they are people.

Is our ignorance the most critical element in they way how to deal that distance. For example the first time I tried a blind to cross a street I tried to held his arm... I didn't know instead He was supposed to grab my arm. It's funny now imagine how much fun it must have been watching a fight between a blind and a fool... and who finally lost ;).

I had an hearing impaired (not deaf, but nearly) friend in school. He was the most beautiful person around and was very fun deal with him. Probably he was a little annoying sometimes when in a hurry he didn't want to hear us (lol). He wasn't much different from us, the mayor difference was the way in how we communicate with him. We must say thing s l o w l y, letter by letter. Of course sometimes he just didn't understand us, or he answer us, in his frequent rush, something undecipherable. I don't know how is he now.

Probably is difficult try to do not think in the reason of a lost limb. I don't remember a particular situation but maybe I had many.

My brother lost an eye too, so It took me some time to realize that when I walk beside him I had to walk in one side... Many times in the house he crash on me because I was careless and he wasn't paying enough attention(I know he simply can't see me if I stand in the wrong spot). I can't think that my brother is disabled but I know that he had some limitations (Who doesn't?), but he is able to do many things I can't.

What did I learn of this game?

Simply. Disability is a matter of belief, capabilities are matter of effort and limits are just lines draw in thin air if you have help of others.

Besides you are a wonderful person if you are unable to reach him/her you are the disabled one.

The feelings the game gave me were the motivation to understand better the people around me, after all if I can hear then, I can't see them, I can't feel them the disabled one is me.

The other day, I was sitting on the train headed into the city, when a man walked up to me, tapped me on the shoulder, and held out a pen and pad. He had written ""Do you know the time?  _____ ""; gesturing for me to write a response.

At first I wondered about the man hold the pad, and was about to reach for it, but it soon clicked what the situation at hand is.

I signed back, ""It is half past 12 o'clock"".

This got me a suprised and joyful look from him, as he signed back ""Thank you. Wow, you know sign!""

Shortly following this came possibly the best 10 minutes ever. We chatted about several different subjects and events, however most of it was him correcting or explaining a sign I didn't know. It was still a humbling experience and felt awesome to put a cool skill into practice.

As a short side note, I had known a bit of sign before KS, but only started taking classes after it, being influenced by Shizune's route.

How about everyone else? Are there any similar experiences that people have had that would've been different if not for KS?"	t5_2tb50	True

&gt;I lost my mother in a house fire when I saw three, and my father ran out on me and left me to an orphanage, where I was teased for my anti-social behavior and quiet demeanor.

&gt;I was adopted when I was seven by my 'new parents', but I don't speak to them often. I don't really like talking at all, to be honest.

&gt;I won't give you pictures of my scars, so please don't ask me.

I got a request to bring it here, because I've played the game and suffered from a bad case of the feels. If I'm not allowed to x-post this, I'll delete this and lurk under my other account.

1327333539.0	osygv	Lilly's route wrecked me.	JohnsBrokenHeart	88	8	32	"--WARNING, SPOILERS, Because I can't get the actual spoiler tags to work.--

I never wanted to be this guy. I laughed at people who played VNs for having ""waifus"" and not being able to be part of society.

I mean, let's face it, I've cried at particularly good games before (Red Dead Redemption or MGS4 anyone?), but come on, a dating sim? Especially a degrading one about disabled girls that 4chan (4CHAN!) is advocating.

But hey, I was bored, it was free, I gave it a spin.

The intro didn't really pull me in. I felt like I was reading some shoujo-esque high school manga. I could tell the flags from the questions, and which one would lead me to which girl. I laughed at the obvious approach to ""pathing"" that the developers took. But again, I was bored, so I continued.

I ended up going on the Lilly route. I was somewhat interested by her before. The tall, beautiful girl that you spent a quiet afternoon drinking tea with. Better than the walking stereotypes of Shrinking Violet girl, Cloud Cucko Lander girl, or Plucky Cute girl. And Shizune's attitude was a bit off-putting to me, so I quickly came to my conclusion.

I was enthralled. We spent time together, arm in arm, quietly whiling away the hours. Having tea and talking about the world. I felt myself missing her when she left, sad that I couldn't see her face. And somewhat embarrassed that I cared about a 2 dimensional character that much. It felt like a weight was lifted when he finally called her and told her he missed her.

And then we went to the vacation house. To see concern from someone who obviously has had a hard life of her own touched me. To be cared for by someone who couldn't even see like a ""normal"" person was humbling. And then she confessed. It was a beautiful scene, one with emotions and feelings that I didn't nearly expect from this game.

It felt natural, two perfectly complimentary personalities that realized they fit together like pieces of a puzzle. We leaned on one another. I fucked up a lot, thinking she needed my help, but I realized we needed one another just as much.

The only thing I'd read about the route was to tell her the truth, so I tried to at every turn. But in the end, she left.

I felt like a failure. I couldn't even get a fake relationship right. I couldn't keep her with me, the one girl that got me.

The truth is, in real life, I feel like that all the time. I feel alone. I feel unwanted. I've watched 4 ex girlfriends leave me alone and so many ""friends"" disappear from my life. I know that agony he felt in the hospital room, feeling worthless and weak, without someone to lean on. An empty feeling of loss and hopelessness.

And then, the music box played.

I couldn't have stopped myself if I wanted to. I bawled like a baby. Not the epic tears that hit me at the end of MGS4 (I'd been a life-long fan, you see), not the sad tears that came when I lost my grandfathers, but sharp, warm tears of happiness and love. I watched her come in and hug me through watery eyes. I sat through the epilogue with a burning chest.

-----

You see, this is all I've ever wanted. I'm an escapist. I hate the real world. I play games and read books and watch movies to try and get somewhere else. And, embarrassingly like a young girl, all I want out of life is a fairy-tale romance like Hisao and Lilly have. I've always wanted that. A girl that I can be romantic with, a princess that I can court and hold and smile quietly with. A girl that I would willingly fight to the death for and die happily knowing I protected.

It's not about her being blind or anything like that. It's about finding something that precious to you and following it to the breaking point. I know that I would've done the same, running after her in spite of a condition like that. That I'd risk death, knowing that life without her would be even more painful.

And I laid in my bed that night, feeling that loneliness, that emptiness. I know it's not real. I know that those types of stories are just in books and games. It tears me up inside. But I can wish. And believe me, if I ever find my Lilly, I'm never letting her go."	t5_2tb50	True

It's all high quality and really sets the right mood for the scenes.  A lot of it makes me nostalgic remembering my own time in high school, and growing up playing Final Fantasy 8 (for some reason, a lot of the music reminds me of the lighter stuff in the game, particularly [FH](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMYisFOaz1s), [Breezy (Balamb's music)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLH9BIR4QEc), [Tell Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXF0paveuAA&amp;feature=related0), and [Love Grows](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBWCTYE3Dcc&amp;feature=related)).  

I've started to associate various songs with events in the paths I've played so far (just Emi and Shizune so far, starting a Hanako path next).  It's one of the better OSTs I've heard - I'd put it in my top 10 in a heartbeat.  But even without thinking about the music in terms of quality, it manages to do something powerful - it invokes an emotional response.  That's **EXACTLY** what art is supposed to do, and the music in Katawa Shoujo hit dead on in that regard.  

When I first fired up the game, still not quite sure what to expect and thinking myself a pretty emotionally stable guy, I didn't think much of the main menu music and mainly just regarded it as background noise while I investigated my settings (wasn't sure what there was to set as KS is my first visual novel - certainly won't be my last).  But after finishing Emi's path, and coming back to the main menu...  Onions.  Onions everywhere, partially from Emi's path opening old wounds in my life, but then that menu music bringing me full circle back to the start...

I had this thought about the music while in my third playthrough, and tabbed out to [Ease](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyKa2LwBVnk).  Those onions are in my room again, I think.  Even if I save at a happy moment in the paths I'm on, the main menu still makes me teary eyed.

If you haven't downloaded the OST yet, it's [on the official site](http://www.katawa-shoujo.com/download.php).

TL;DR:  The purpose of music, and all art, is to invoke an emotional response in the listener.  Katawa Shoujo soundtrack: nailed it?  This Redditor says yes."	t5_2tb50	True

I need to talk about this, get everything out there, you know? My mind is just a haze right now and I've shed my lurker status after three years.

 The best way I can think to do that is girl by girl, in the style of a review with all my feels along the way. I'll go in the order that my playthrough went. 

I suppose it all began, funnily enough, when I was on the hunt for fap material. It's kind of weird how that habit led me to this game which then led me to reconsider the habit along with a whole bunch of other stuff, but I'm getting ahead of myself.

**1. Emi**

New to the VN thing, I stumbled into her story by accident. I didn't necessarily want to, but I was trying to play as close to myself as I could and I'm totally the kind of hubristic mofo that would run hard in spite of a heart condition. From then on, I was Emi's. At this point I had still been expecting a more typical hentai game - for some reason the light piano in the intro and the general tone hadn't convinced me otherwise yet. I feel like I didn't get as much as I could out of her story as a result.

Don't get me wrong, it was great. After all, it was what hooked me. I would say that she definitely won me over by the end. I could respect her for wanting to be strong and I absolutely could not believe that Hisao couldn't connect the dots with her dad. Rin saying that 'Emi was at her Emiest' when she ran was a really sweet touch as well and I think that overall the romance between Hisao and Emi was one of the more believable beyond Hisao being so obtuse. I was tempted to push her, but I also knew there was a limit. The happy ending was one of the more neatly presented conclusions, though ultimately it did not affect me as much as other ones would. It just seemed like they were happy in the moment and would go on being happy. Once the large obstacle of her not letting you in was overcome, it seemed like they had no reason to part ways. Either way, I can see why she inspired many a player to take up running and that little detail made her story more beautiful in retrospect for sure.

I'd say that Emi's path gets an 8/10 from me.
Emi herself an 7.5. She can't get undervalued because of Hisao being a bit of a dummy, but she may have been a *bit* too childish for me. The cute character rarely does it for me. 

**2. Shizune/Misha**

I wasn't sure at first whether my choices had mattered or whether the game had a set order in which the stories could be played, so I decided to make totally different choices this time around. The Student Council it was. I have to admit that from my first playthrough, the idea of having tea at lunch with Lilly and Hanako seemed to appeal much more to me, but I was testing the choice system, I guess.

I was surprised to find that so many people disliked this path, but in the end, I can see why in some ways. There *is* a lot of build-up with Hisao learning sign language and Misha's confession and proposition. The idea that Siccachan brings people close to her only to push them away was similar to Emi's issue, but here it seemed a bit ridiculous since I had learned a language for her and she had initiated our first sexual encounter in her own house, no less! Either way, I dug her style. She dressed like a classy girl outside of school and I honestly didn't mind her father, although I was waiting for Hisao to really one-up him at some point.

The ending was what I think soured me, though. At the time, the whole 'we'll see each other in 10 years' thing really got to me since I've been in that spot at the end of an era of schooling. Parting ways with people is tough and this ending reflected that. I think it's better that I played this earlier though, since a lot of the other paths allow love to conquer all and have you and your lady head in similar directions. Here, though, it seemed like all that build-up had no pay-off and while that was sad in a beautiful, true to life sort of way, it was still somewhat disappointing. I feel like the story needed to go further, like this happy ending was closer to a neutral ending. Even so, at the time I dug it and my first impression has lasted. But did I miss something or do we never hear about her mother..?

The path gets a 7/10 from me
Shizune gets an 8.75/10. She deserved way bit better, IMO, although I totally identified with her insistence on making sure things are done right, so maybe I deserve a control freak.

**3. Lilly**

At this point, I had figured out that choices definitely mattered, so it was time to go for the tea room girls. I technically created 3 files at once and got them all to Act 2 with the remaining three girls at once, but Lilly was the first I went further with. Her story was pretty great, honestly. The courting was believable and I loved all the trips into town. It was also nice to get a bit of a preview of Hanako at the same time and I loved that she became her own person as a result of our romance. The intimacy was the most fleshed out of any of the paths, but still suited Lilly's playful yet elegant demeanor.

Akira was a welcome addition to the cast and the trip to the country was a lovely set piece. In the moment, the ending was great, it really brought me on a roller coaster of emotions, though in retrospect the perfectness of it did seem a bit much. I guess that she didn't have that much of a reason to ditch Hisao after all, but the fact that he almost died and her returning to him in the hospital with the music box and everything was a bit too perfect. I *really* appreciated that there was an epilogue, though. It made me all warm and fuzzy. 

Overall, I enjoyed it but I think it made the least of an impression on me. Also the fact that each path was written by someone different started to dawn on me here with all of the heart problems and the spicier love scenes. 

The path gets a 7.5. It just felt a bit too easy.
Lilly gets a 8.25 though. Her calm, sweet, yet playful way of being was pretty irresistible at times. 

**4. Rin**

Holy. Shit. I left the two feelingest of feel times for last. I know Rin is even less popular than Shizune in a lot of ways, but I'm not sure - her path totally floored me. The enigma of her character slowly unfolding before my eyes was so organic and felt so rewarding. Her quirky philosophizing and her struggling with proper communication reminded me of the kind of conversations *I* have sometimes and I have to say that her video was by far the best in my mind. Totally captured her character and the relationship to come. The image of what she sees while drawing still flashes in my mind. Her 'hugs' are amazing, the smoking scene is beautifully heart-wrenching, and her choices were some of the harder ones to make for me. Hisao being a bit of an idiot was almost excusable here since she was such a tough nut to crack. 

The ending, though. Oh man. 'What is that feeling when everything in your heart feels okay' or something along those lines. That clinched it for me. I love her path, even if she isn't the most immediately relatable of the girls. While the Art Teacher may have been a bit of a controversial guy, I don't know that I hated him that much. He was trying to get a real talent out into the world. The uncertainty of where the romance will lead is frustrating, but in the best way possible. 'I don't think it matters', Rin says about her career as an artist. It's meta within the context of the game, but so true to her story as well. She can finally be herself. 

The path gets a 9.5. Definitely my favourite. 
Rin herself gets a 7.0, she'd be worth it in the end if the story went like it did for Hisao, but I don't know that I could make the kind of calls the game let him. 

**5. Hanako**

The fan favourite. And I can see why. While I was disappointed that she didn't get to develop as a person in the same way that dating Lilly let her, I think that she still gets to grow here. She no longer needs to be doted on in the end and I think that, other than Rin's path, this is the best pay-off for all of Hisao's efforts. From the moment I started the game and bumped into her in the library, I knew that I would like to get to know her story. The parallel of her scars and Hisao's was lovely and not overdone thankfully. I also dug her fashion sense as much as Shizune's. The cap was a nice touch. Playing pool with her was a great set piece and I think that the path does well to punish players who try to coddle her too much. 

The ending had mad feels, of course, seeing a cutie like her cry would make anyone feel. It was warm and full of promise, but didn't necessarily hit me as much as Rin's did. I think that this is one of the endings that is most believable and that bodes best for the couple's future. Even if neither of them totally know what they are going to do in the future, they are kind of stuck with each other now after everything they've been through. 

The path gets an 8.5. It was so close to matching the greatness of Rin's!
Hanako herself gets an 8.75. I think that a synthesis of her and Shizune (sensitive yet assertive somehow?) might be close to my ideal.

The music in the game was great, no complaints, only feels.
The animations at the beginning of each Act 2 were great, in order I liked : Rin's, Hanako's, Shizune's, Emi's, and Lilly's, although if Rin's is like a 9.5/10, then Lil;y's is still something like an 8/10 or at worst a 7.5. They were all amazing.

But on to the feels themselves...

When I first finished *everything*, the rest of the day was a total write-off. Granted, every other day during the playthrough had been as well, but now I couldn't even turn to a new path. There was a void in me. I think that one of the writers did an AMA and pointed out that the game only pointed to things that were already there inside you and I tend to agree. The game didn't create a place in me and then vacate it within a few days, that's not how things like that work.

No, I think that it pointed to a void already in me and I guess highlighted it for me. 

My brain hurt. My heart hurt. I wondered whether I could feel anything like what the characters in the VN felt, I wondered if I knew what love felt like beyond this secondary point of view. I literally stared at my ceiling for an hour before I finally jotted some of my thoughts down on paper and that helped, but it still left the void rather raw if only less obscured. And then I turned to the Internet. It was nice to see that people had similar experiences with Katawa Shoujo, that I wasn't alone in this. All the self-posts here and elsewhere, the fan art, and the promotional stuff for the VN allowed me another fix of KS before the heaviness of withdrawal returned. But then I found the 4-Chan poll - (For the lazy or uninformed: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1758493/4chan-survey.png) and it kind of blew my mind.

Not all of the stuff about the girls themselves, I could have guessed the results to *those* polls without having to check, but rather the lifestyle changes the game caused in people. I already said I get the running thing, the idea of trust between you and Emi that forms as you become running partners as well as the physical benefit it has for Hisao (he is doing much better at the end of her path than any other in this regard) were enough for me to guess at that. Heck - the night I'd finished Emi, I lay awake convincing myself that I would join a gym and start running more. Still probably will. People started drinking tea too. Mmhmm. I could get that as well, but I was an avid tea drinker before KS, maybe that's what drew me to Lilly and Hanako at first. I also like reading and chess, so I guess I had those covered.

No, for me the two that floored me were improved eating habits and reduced masturbation. At first I couldn't really understand how KS really led people to these changes in habit. It wasn't like the above changes, these weren't the adoption of new hobbies that the girls specifically had, nor were they really present in the game at all (eating better was a little bit, mind). These were concrete psychological transformations that KS had caused and it was at that point that I realized that I hadn't craved sugar or masturbated in days. I don't know that I was ever addicted to masturbation, but I used to do it multiple times a day and every time I would try to stop, I would fail. I finished KS on Saturday and haven't had the urge to get off in that way since. The last time I masturbated, in fact, was to Misha's sex scene, which, while uncomfortable to be sure, fell under the perverse category of 'sex with someone you shouldn't be having sex with' that I can lose myself to in my fantasies. The other sex scenes were arousing to be sure, but I guess I felt like masturbating would cheapen them? I don't know but either way the VN has broken something in me that I thought was unbreakable. And I owe it for that, at least. 

At the end of this wall of text, what am I left with? I downloaded this game looking for porn, and have ended up not wanting to look for porn any time in the foreseeable future. While playing through the different paths, I looked to KS for models of love and companionship that I could relate to and instead ended up feeling drained by the knowledge that such models are rare to nonexistent. I'm in the heat of finals at university and I still take an extra hour to fall asleep in the morning and an extra hour to get up because the VN had that much of an impact on me. It's sitting on my desktop and I want to re-visit certain parts, maybe re-do Eli and Shizune's paths to see how they measure up to my 'eureka' moment in Rin, but I know that such an undertaking could only bring more of these conflicting feels and it's sad, but I don't have time for them right now. It begs the question - what else have I given up on because 'I didn't have time'? Have I passed up chances at true love because they weren't framed for me in a narrative that all but guaranteed a picturesque romance with someone whose personality was set in stone- er code? I was in a really bad way for the first couple of days after completing Katawa Shoujo. I literally wondered whether I was capable of loving another person. I questioned my love for family and friends. I wondered whether I would ever be able to find someone that I would be able to honestly say that I love. 

I wouldn't be able to say I had learned anything from the VN if I didn't answer this by saying 'I don't think it matters'. It clearly does matter at some point, but not in the present moment. For now I'm just going to *be*...

If anyone actually reads this without downvoting because TL;DR, then thank you. Writing all of this out was difficult, but I think it's helped me. It had better have helped, anyway... I don't want to have dropped my lurker status for nothing.

I just wanted to put that out there. Do you think you could start a similar journey today?

A few years ago, I was diagnosed with a genetic collagen deficiency, a mix of three types of something called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (I have a mix of types II, III and IV) and was given the ""I don't know how you lasted this long without serious injury"" speech (I've had countless minor ones throughout my life, though!) Collagen is a base protein that gives strength to everything, skin, hair, bones, etc, it also lines joints to keep bones in place. Well, I have none, my base collagen is replaced with elastin, the stuff that makes your body stretch and squishy. As you can imagine, this affects everything in my body. My condition started to worse when I hit 20 (when I stopped growing, apparently) and has continued in decline since (I'm now 26.)

To start, I have a form of arrhythmic tachycardia thanks to a valve prolapse. This means my heard beats oddly when it beats too fast, because my autonomic system doesn't work properly (this controls temperature, adrenalin, blood pressure, etc). So straight away I was hit with similarities (and I sure recognised a few of the medications that appeared) if I move too fast, get too hot, get hit in the chest, etc, I will blackout. Luckily, it's slim that I'll actually have a heart attack, although what I have feels a lot like what I imagine dying to feel like. Fast heart beat also means high anxiety (thanks to the adrenalin, I guess) as well as low blood pressure, which again means blackouts.

I almost didn't want to continue playing after the intro, thanks to my surprising resemblance to Hisao, but I wanted to see how it would progress. Introduced were Shizune and Misha, who both showed sides of my personality (I'm also bipolar, so I often act like Misha as a ""defence"" if that makes sense at all, loud, centre of attention, etc, I have no idea why, because I hate it!)

Then Hanako appeared and I really started to worry. The lack of collagen means my skin is similar to bread dough (but a bit more elastic) and most of my body (from the neck down) is scarred from where my skin has stretched under its own weight. I have hundreds of white/silver scars all several inches long covering my shoulders, upper arms (to just lower than the elbow), chest, stomach and legs. In direct light, these scars also shimmer. Luckily, unlike Hanako, I have very few on my hands and face. They won't heal, and I can't get rid of them, in fact, any new cut or scratch will scar me, too. This has always bothered me, since I can remember, and people always liked to point it out.

Aside from wearing glasses for extreme short-sightedness, I didn't have too much in common with Kenji or Lilly (although with the heart thing, I can have ""whiteouts"" where I get blinded for a few minutes, especially if I reach too high or stand up too fast... I'm also extremely light sensitive.) After their respective stories, I felt glad that I have the sight I do, and sad that there are people who don't. It made me feel bad, that it wasn't right somehow.

Now on to Emi and Rin. I have all of my limbs, but my joints are loose and are prone to separating very easily. I have dislocated both hips and knees when there was a strong wind... Literally blew me into a heap on the floor. I also had to have people relocate my arms a few times, usually friends, family, co-workers, etc. I've even had a doc beat the heck out of my back to force a rib back in, that threw some disks in my back and I couldn't walk for three days.

Anyway, I understand not having the use of an arm or a leg, but again, I'm lucky that (with some effort) I can get mine back. Like Rin, I was a bit of an artist (good, according to my tutor several years ago, sketching portraits) however, soon after I was diagnosed, I slipped a disk in my neck which put me in hospital (one of many visits, this being the longest one.) This was my ""serious injury"", and I damaged the main nerve to my right arm, which won't heal. My arm still works, but it's odd. I had to learn how to use it again, how to write, move my fingers, etc. Sometimes it hurts a lot, and other times it's like it's not quite there. A phantom limb.

I played the entire game, every route, 100%, and I felt odd after. These fictional characters had learnt to adapt and live (like I slowly am, after my rather rapid decline) I've been retired from working (I'm literally not allowed to work) and spend my time in books, the Internet, video games (hand/finger joints and right arm permitting) and at the recommendation of my physio, Lego! (to help me to relearn my dexterity) I need distractions to keep me away from my own thoughts, but sadly, not many people understand that.

I've certainly had ""feels"" from this game and it's also helped to boost my self-esteem. I've only recently come across Reddit (through Katawa Shoujo, oddly) and finally feel brave enough to tell my story. Plus it's like 3am, and I feel a bit more of an emotional wreck when my medications are wearing off in the middle of the night.

Well, thanks for reading this rather long mess, and thank you for accepting these (albeit fictional) broken people, it makes me happy.

1327826139.0	p1jmf	My reaction to Katawa Shoujo, very long and kinda personal	MrBackpack	68	8	13	"This has been gnawing at me for the past couple of days, seeing all the posts about how Katawa Shoujo has changed people's lives, and all my own comments on many of them. It's time that I shared my story.

I have often been described, and often described myself as such, as a negative, cynical, sarcastic asshole; a persona that I redly embraced. It was easier to be all those negative things, become numb, than to face reality.

Then, along comes my best friend , the woman who would become my girlfriend and now fiancé; she saw through  my act and we started a relationship. There were hard times, I was in college two-and-a-half hours away, but we got through the four years that it took me to graduate with 'skype-Saturdays' and random texts throughout the week.

Now, like any 19-23 year-old male, I am/was a randy bastard. However, when we started dating, we made and agreement: she was going to wait until her wedding night for her first time, and I agreed thinking that I would eventually break that resolve down.

I haven't. We're still waiting.

I'll be honest, it would've been too easy to stray, she would have had no way of finding out; I am proud to say that I never did and she put up with my not-so-subtle hints about moving forward with our physical relationship. I knew after a year of dating, in a very metacognizant kind of way, that I was in love with my girlfriend, that I would love her for the rest of my life, but I wouldn't let myself really feel those emotions.

I had long since locked those emotions away, deep within myself, behind as many barriers and walls as I could erect ; keeping what I felt for my girlfriend as close to my real emotions as I could without really letting her in.

We got engaged in August of 2011.

Fast froward to the release of Katawa Shoujo, the real turning point in this whole rambling diatribe.

Like many, I downloaded the game for the hentai, thinking that it would simply be a quick fap and then delete the game and go about the rest of my life. I, being the reader that I am, stopped to read a bit of the prologue and quickly became enamored with the story, forgetting my original intention for downloading very quickly. I played through Emi's story first, then Hanako, followed by Rin and Shizune, smiling when the girls did, frowning at their sorrows, and grinning during the 'good endings;' but nothing really hit me, they were just characters on the screen, well done characters, but just art and a good story, nothing else.

Then along came Lilly.

Lilly waltzed right through my mind and into my heart, right past all the defenses that I had and stood before the fortress that I build around the deeper parts of my psyche.

By the end of her 'good ending' Lilly had walked through every defense, every wall, every barrier and lock that I had, right into the vault that held my locked my emotions into. She took my hidden emotions by the hand and led them out of the fortress, smiling as the fortress fell away behind her, leaving a gaping hole in my heart.

She then took my emotions over to my fiancé's location, joined them together and shoved them into the hole in my heart.

Fast forward again, to a couple of weeks ago, my fiancé and I were watching a movie together, curled up on a couch, she was more on me than the couch; and for the first time that I can remember, I wasn't thinking about sex with her, a thought that usually dominated my mind, and this realization didn't make me thing about it either.

I smiled, a real, warm smile as I pulled her closer to me, content to bask in this feeling of being truly and utterly in love.

Now, that was long and melodramatic, but I think that it had to be said to really get the point across that Katawa Shoujo is and can be a game changer in your life. I didn't want to be changed, I thought that I was fine just the way that I was. Katawa Shoujo will change you, you might realize how great a 'game' can be at telling a story or you might realize, like I did, that your life can be so much better than it really is, it doesn't take all that much effort to change. 

**TL;DR** Lilly changed how I connect with people, KS can change you

Without a doubt, I know that this has been said, but the world needs more stories like this; it's one of the most moving and human experiences that I have ever been through, be it in a movie, book or poem; as a English BA graduate, I have been through many 'moving' experiences, but nothing has ever been this powerful.

This is my game of the year 2012. I know that I will probably play other games more than KS, might even enjoy them more than KS, but nothing is going to stick with me like KS will.

I've been an amputee from birth (a birth defect caused my left leg to be shorter then my right, and my parents decided amputation was the best option in order for me to have maximum mobility). As a member of the handicapped community, I just want to say that playing this game was very special to me. The game nails it on how we wish to be treated- just like anybody else. Our physical limitations are not a problem unless you make it a problem. It was also interesting to get an idea of what the experience of dating a handicapped person might be like on the other end of the stick. I would absolutely recommend this game to pretty much anybody- not only as an awesome romance game, but as a way to better understand what it's like to know and live with handicapped people.

P.S.- Rin is definitely my favorite. It took me forever to get to her good ending(I refused to use a flowchart), and when I did it felt super rewarding. Emi was pretty cool too, for obvious reasons :)

1356617559.0	15ip4h	Discussion: Katawa Shoujo and social stigma regarding the line between real life and fiction.	Falconhaxx	67	8	64	"So, I've been thinking about this for a while, mostly due to [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/d99tN.png). When I read a really great book, I become enchanted by the story and characters of that book, and they affect my emotions. The ASOIAF books are a great example, as is the Wheel of Time series. I guess Harry Potter did that for me too, when I was younger.

The problem is that I always hopelessly fall in love with a character, which I can never admit to anyone because of the social stigma(""Dude, you love a fictional character? That's weird and sad.""). With the aforementioned books, I usually don't have a hard time keeping that to myself, because it's not like it affects my life in any tangible way.

With Katawa Shoujo, the problem is different. I ended up loving all the characters, of course, but that in itself is not the problem. The problem is that these characters, being so lifelike and realistic that they could actually exist, somewhere, somehow, make me want to get off my ass and do something with my life. Which, in turn, causes the dilemma of the answer when people ask ""Why did you suddenly start running and listening to piano music?"". I could never lie about something like that, but what would people think if I said ""Oh, I was inspired by a fictional character""?

To me, Katawa Shoujo is real because the vast majority of the plot elements and characters are plausible. If I ever admit that to someone else they will, of course, think I'm weird and ""out of touch with reality"". I think that even people who have played Katawa Shoujo usually try to tell themselves ""Nah, this was just a book, it's fiction, it's not real"". You are allowed to obsess over lots of things, why not over this?

Why is it so taboo, in this world, to pretend that a fictional character is real? For the vast majority of people, it causes no problems. Is it because it's so awkward for others to adjust to the notion that there is something that they cannot see, hear or touch that is still so extremely important to another person? If someone wants to pretend that they're running with Emi, is that so wrong? 

Why is it that it's so extremely difficult for me to even write about this? Where did humanity go so horribly wrong that matter triumphed over mind? If I want to create a universe inside my brain, why am I not allowed?"	t5_2tb50	True

A good friend of mine told me last week he was 'going on a manly picnic'.  My initial thought was that it was funny that he'd accidentally made a reference to Katawa Shoujo.  But over the next few days he told me several times, really pointedly, that he was 'going on a manly picnic'.  It was weird the way he kept mentioning it randomly in conversations we were having, and sort of half staring at me, half trying to look casual whenever he brought it up.

I started thinking about it.  He'd broken up with his partner about a month ago and hadn't handled it too well.  He'd been moping for a while, but I'd never paid it too much mind as he was able to bounce back well enough whenever we were socialising.  I knew he was sad, but I figured that's all it was.

And then I thought: 'Is my friend trying to tell me he's considering taking his life?'

It didn't seem like him but you never know.  I didn't think he'd ever played KS, but, again, most of my friends don't know I've played it either, so maybe he had.  He certainly knew I'd played it, because I'd talked about it, so maybe he was trying to tell me something.

I'm glad that a few days later I actually worked up the balls to broach this very uncomfortable subject and ask him if everything was all right.  He just stared at me and told me he'd be fine, that the 'manly picnic' was tomorrow and then everything would be fine.

He asked me if I'd be there for him.  He looked almost guilty as he asked.

I told him I would, but that life would get better, he just needed to hang on.  He asked what he had to hang onto.  I told him he had friends, and we were here for him, and that we'd help him.  I told him not to take his own life.

He stared at me for about a minute and then asked me what the fuck I was talking about.  I asked him if he was talking about the 'manly picnic' from Katawa Shoujo and he said: ""What the fuck is a katawa shoujo?  I have a picnic, in Manly, this weekend, with my new girl, and I need a hand getting my boxes to her place on the train.  I sent you an email about this a week ago and I'm still waiting for you to tell me if you're free to help me.""

So thanks Katawa Shoujo community for this incredibly embarrassing experience.  Thanks to you bastards I'm now seeing feels everywhere, even when there aren't any.  I'd forgotten that before I played KS I, too, was able to spend an entire week without feeling great depth of emotion in every god damn personal relationship.  Thanks to you guys being so open about your emotions I've forgotten that that's nor normal."	t5_2tb50	True

1330578287.0	qciio	Inspirational Quote from Neil deGrasse Tyson, from his AMA	FreudChicken	63	10	12	"""The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation.
For me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you.""

I think what Dr. Tyson is saying is so profound, and it relates to almost everyone, especially those who've played KS. This quote embodies the main essence of KS and its lessons to learn from. We can't just sit back and wait for our life to play out, for it unfold itself according to our intentions; life's just not like that. Nor can we expect to find things like love, meaningfulness, and motivation simply by searching for it, expecting it to be like some treasure buried in the ground. We have to grasp life in our own hands, and seize the initiative. 

The beginning of Rin's last scene, Proof of existence, begins with Hisao's thoughts on the idea of being in the present

&gt;""Present is a fleeting and vague concept at best. The moment between the past and the future? That doesn't really mean anything. Thinking too much about things that don't make sense is a waste of time. That's why living through the present is always the best option. Besides, for us who can't foresee the future and who forget the past too easily, present is really the only proof of our existence. Even though existence will go on even if you forget about it for a while, it's good to seize the day at least every once in a while.

&gt;That way...you can confirm that you are, in fact...alive.

I thought that this intro quote and Tyson's quote go fairly well together. We have to deal with life as it is today, and yeah, life does seem shitty and unfair at times. But, that's part of the human experience; we can't help if life throws a curveball at us sometimes. We gotta generate our own meaning and motivation, and use that to push us forward, past these obstacles into a better life."	t5_2tb50	True

1328842292.0	pisg0	Today, I ran for Emi.	xsq	58	5	36	"KS has me in a funk, so I decided to run for Emi today.

I'm a skinny guy, but I haven't run in a long time, so I wasn't sure how long I could keep it up. I used [Emi's chart](http://i.imgur.com/2Owsp.png) (thank you, whoever made that!) as a baseline, but I was feeling pretty good after alternating 60 second jogs with 90 second walks, so I bumped it up to 90 second jogs with 90 second walks.

I was still feeling good, so I decided to stop counting after eight reps and just run for Emi. After all, pushing my limits is what made her interested in me in the first place, right? I only stopped when I thought Emi was satisfied, and that made me happy too. I exceeded my own expectations considerably.

I'm not doing it to impress a real life girl. I'm not doing it to lose weight. I might be doing it to improve my mood. But I know for sure that I'm doing it for Emi, and I'm perfectly happy with that as sufficient justification.

Afterwards, I rewarded myself with a piece of hard candy and a shower with Emi.

God bless you, Emi.

I'm here to give you an update on what we've been doing and to announce that we're opening the auditions for the voice actors. For any part you wish to specifically audition for, I'd ask that you read two-five lines of dialogue on whatever audio equipment you have, both to give us a gauge of your audio technology capabilities and vocal talents. If you have examples of past work you'd like to use instead, that's fine, but it must be done on equipment you have access to. All auditions are to be posted [**here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/LHaSREHi/comments/1ftvxn/casting_calls_here/) where the audio team and I can find them.

Now on to the updates. Well this has been crazy, we started in late January with just the idea that maybe we could make this anime actually happen and four months later we're well into it now. To anyone that has not heard, we are in the process of creating our own website to host a forum for our show that will be opening soon. 

While I can't give too much away about the series, I can reveal one very important thing, the name. We need a new name due to the fact that, in the event that 4leaf ever makes an official anime of their own they can make one without having to worry about confusion. Well, we've been trying hard to come up with a new name for the series to distinguish ourselves from the VN, and we our tentatively going by the title **Kokoro no Shoujou**, ""Conditions of the Heart"".  

Anyone wishing to help out with the rest of the production is still able to join. We are always looking for more artists and animators, so if you think your talents are good for us, just post go to our subreddit /r/LHaSREHi and post a submission of your work, or just PM me directly, and we'll add you to the team."	t5_2tb50	True
1366287806.0	1clnug	What Hanako taught me	Dr1mpossible	67	12	19	"So I finished the Hanako arc on Monday and I've just been dealing with all these emotions (I refuse to use the word 'feels') ever since. I decided maybe typing everything out would sort some things out in my head. But where to start?

This storyline touched me more than I care to admit, and not so much in the 'OMG Hanako is my new waifu :3' kind of way. In fact... I think I've already found 'my Hanako'. 

Bear with me.

Ok, my girlfriend isn't actually an orphaned burn survivor with crippling shyness, athough, I did choose Hanako to go for first since, minus the burns, she looked most like her (An asian with long black hair? How rare D:). My SO has her fair share of strife, mostly in the forms of eating disorders and secondary depression stemming from this, not to mention a generally unhealthy home environment. Ever since I met her, all I've wanted to do is be there for her and see her get better. When she's happy, whenever the moment takes her, even if just for a while, she forgets about everything that's wrong. She's carefree and, by extension, so am I. Those days I'm on top of the world. Other days though, after a binge, after a rough day at uni/home it suddenly feels like the world is ending. A lot of days I would sit there on the phone with her in total silence because I can't make her feel better, I would repeat the same stale reassurances over and over, try and make her come out with me to take her mind off things etc. I tried everything those days and nothing ever seemed to work. Even after everything she's done to make my life well and truly amazing, I could't make her happy and it killed me inside. I met her pretty soon after moving to a new country for university too, so a lot of the time, I put making new friends, and just generally making a new life, on hold just to be there for her 24/7. Her own personal distress line. I could never pull her out of those moments though, no matter how hard I tried, no matter how much I wanted to. It was rough, more on her than on me, obviously, but I love her so much I was usually only ever happy when she was.

I realised something along the way though, something that took me almost 2 years and Hisao a few days and a call from Lilly to realise: She didn't need me to be there for her 24/7 waiting by the phone, she didn't need me to constantly 'pull' her out of it all, all she needed was the knowledge that I existed. I could never fully actualize this thought in my mind until I played this game though. With regards to the eating disorder/depression, my girlfriend is a lot better now, a damn sight better than when I first met her despite the fact that over the entirety of our relaltionship I haven't felt like I've done much, if anything, whatsoever. I guess that's the point though. I think just being here helped her, having someone who truly loved her not just because he wanted to help the broken girl he saw, but because he could see past that and see the beautiful one underneath the cracks, one that he would go to any length to be with. Having someone there like that gives you that motivation to push forward and get out of whatever destructive cycle is controlling your life so you can be whole again and make them as happy as they make you in return.

I guess around there was when the line between Hanako and my SO blurred (along with my vision) and I sat there, man tears streaming unashamedly down my face thinking ""I finally understand.""

I've read a lot of posts that say that Hanako's ending is bitter sweet since she doesn't 'fix herself'. In fact, I think CplCrud himself said he didn't intend for Hanako to have any 'good' endings at all. But for me, at least in my headcanon, Hanako get's better, sure their relationship is highly codependent, but if you're willing to stick it out, fixing that after everything else you've been through isn't too hard. At least in my experience.

Thanks 4LS, you beautiful bastards, for making my year.

And sorry about the wall of text and unwarranted life story &gt;_&gt;

TL;DR I can't play the other arcs now because it feels like I'm cheating on my girlfriend:("	t5_2tb50	True
1359189926.0	17b470	Thank you, 4 Leaf Studios	YonderPosterior	57	7	81	"Four Leaf Studio,

Thank you so much, I can't say that enough.  I tried out Katawa Shoujo when it was featured on the Front Page a week or two back, with no idea of what I was getting myself into.  I have never been so emotionally attached with any Video Game, Movie, or Book that I've ever spent time on.  There were times that I would be grinning from ear to ear, completely and blissfully happy at how events turned out; then there would be other times where I would be crying my eyes out.  KS has made such an impact on my life, and opened my eyes to so much.  I want to refine myself, I want to learn how to truly be there for someone.  I want to go out and become more active, and learn to see what others are trying to express.  I want to truly understand someone, the way they see things.  

I'm sad, though..  Sad because, it's over.  We all go through our lives, getting hooked on one thing and sticking with it until they're done.  Then waiting, waiting until the next thing comes along that'll captivate them.  I don't know when something will come along that'll move me as much as KS did, if ever.  For me, KS might be that one game that I'll always look back to and say ""That was the best story I've ever read.."", I could be wrong..  But I don't want to be, honestly.

Even though I'm done, KS will always be with me.  Lilly, Hanako, Emi, Rin, Shizune (And Misha, of course) will always hold a special and dear place in my heart.

So, Thank You, 4 Leaf Studios.  It's been an incredible journey.

Sincerely,

A Fan for Life."	t5_2tb50	True

After a few games we moved onto Taiko where I smashed my way through the higher difficulty modes and threw my sticks a couple of times.

Just as I we were in the middle of a heated game of Taiko, I felt a strange light nudge on my arm. I ignored it a hit a few more notes, the nudge became a small tug. I spun around, sticks high in hands, and standing there was a girl holding a board with a piece of paper. 

I stood slightly perplexed and looked at her for a few seconds. She looked a about in her early 20's or so. Her build was petite. She wore a red checkered shirt and jeans shorts. Above the pad was a pretty face with big eyes. Her hair was long and black, with two braids at the sides. She looked a bit timid and cute at the same time with those puppy dog eyes. I thought she might have even passed for Japanese if she was whiter. No doubt she was a little startled by my sudden reaction to her presence. She quickly smiled at me and pushed her pad forward. 

I thought I was going to see a marketing research or survey, but straight away the words ""deaf mute"" and ""donation"" made me realise instantly what it was. There were four or five names already on the form, along with dates and amounts. I smiled back and happily took her pen in hand. I paused when I entered the date, I'd never been good with remember dates. She saw it and gestured the numbers ""6"", ""3"" and ""0"" with her hand. I smiled again and wrote it down. At the amount column, I looked at the other ones which were all 10 or 20 RMB. Without too much thought, I scribbled down a 50. Then I took 50 RMB from my wallet and handed it to her. She gladly accepted it and gave me one of these in return - [image](http://i50.tinypic.com/2vc8ffn.jpg) - it's a small Chinese token of wishing someone good fortune. As I held it in my hand, thinking of what to say, she gave us a small bow and disappeared into the crowd. 

I'd always been a Lillybro myself, but at that moment I wanted to say some things to her. I wanted to tell her that she doesn't need to rely on other peoples' pity, that she's a normal person just like everyone else. I wanted to know what her life is like and I wanted to tell her she' pretty. But that moment has passed. I could only treasure this little symbol of her gratitude. She may not realise, but it'll remind me of this unexpected encounter that hit me right in the feels."	t5_2tb50	True

1374180678.0	1il319	I think most people misinterpret the lessons the game is trying to teach. Asserted: the choices you make to get good/neutral/bad endings are what constitute the message [massive spoilers]	Atario	55	6	16	"To me, the lessons to be drawn are observed by watching which choices result in what outcomes.

Character|Lesson|Explanation
-|-|-
Emi|Consider the help and advice of others.|Ignoring Mutou, Misha, and/or Meiko pushes you toward the bad ending; listening to them pushes you toward the good.
Rin|Support is more important than understanding.|Choices that emphasize or demand understanding her (on the part of yourself or others) over supporting her regardless push you toward the bad or neutral endings.
Shizune|Don't cheat.|Pretty obvious.  ""Comforting"" Misha bad; refraining good.
Lilly|Be open and honest.|Hiding anything gives you the bad ending; being open and honest gives the good.
Hanako|Be available (but don't overdo it).|This may be my most controversial assessment (everyone seems to think it's all about ""white knighting"").  Choosing to ""call it a day"" after Lilly leaves — abandoning Hanako when she needs you most — is what gives the bad ending, whereas going out with her does not.  Choosing to check up on her in her room gives the *neutral* ending, whereas choosing to give her space gives the good.  There's also a minor lesson as well about accepting the advice of others as in Emi's route (giving Hanako space is couched as listening to Lilly's advice, whereas checking up on Hanako is couched as ignoring Lilly's advice).

Of course there are echoes of these lessons elsewhere in the routes, e.g. Lilly's own lack of forthrightness (about her family situation and the summons to Scotland and her feelings about all that stuff) go a long way toward instigating the conflict in her route, reinforcing the message of openness and honesty."	t5_2tb50	True

LilyBro	57	6	20	I finished my first arc Hanako's good ending in one sitting and after completing it was over run with emotions. I realized that I had more feelings for Hanako a fictional character then my actual real girlfriend and that just felt weird to me so I thought about it and waved it off as nothing more then me being overloaded with feelings after taking in so much in a short time so I decided to sleep on it. The next day I woke up and decided to sit down and really think about my feelings, and I came to the conclusion that she wasn't really the kind of girl I wanted to be with and that she was kind of shallow and didn't really seem to care about me. So later in the day I talked to her and told her that I thought it would be best if we broke it off.......And she didn't even bat an eye lash, she didn't give a damn, she didn't really love me, she was just using me for attention and it took a game about dating disabled girls to make me realize I was being used by someone I thought loved me.

1372045582.0	1gy4qo	Everything Eaten and Drunk in KS	MatthewVett	56	6	17	"So, I guess I have too much time on my hands, but I decided I wanted to go through KS and keep track of everything that the characters ate and drank throughout the game in a single spreadsheet, which you can find here: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5IDpnHj_aiOWnhCU2RRdFhuOVU/edit?usp=sharing

The idea was that I wanted to challenge myself to come up with some new recipes for the characters based on what they liked, and in order to determine that, I had to know what they ate, and so you have the above link.  If I missed anything or made any mistakes, let me know.  (Desired) means that the character expressed an interest in eating it in the future, like when Kenji asks to borrow money to order pizza.  (Implied) means that there's evidence that it was eaten, like when there is an empty coffee cup in the nurse's office.  Everything else should be self-explanatory.

The first recipe I came up with is as follows.  I've already made it before, I confess, but since Lilly's fairly addicted to tea, and she enjoys vanilla ice cream as well, it seemed like a natural fit.

Lilly’s French Vanilla Tea Ice Cream

Ingredients

•	1 pint heavy whipping cream

•	1 pint whole milk

•	1 or 2 vanilla beans, split lengthwise with the seeds separated.  If vanilla beans are unavailable, use 1 or 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract, instead.

•	2 tablespoons of your favorite loose leaf tea, or 1 tablespoon of matcha powder.  Amounts can be increased or decreased somewhat if you desire a stronger or weaker tea flavor.

•	8 large egg yolks

•	¾ cup sugar

•	¼ teaspoon salt

Steps

In a heavy saucepan, combine the cream, milk, vanilla, and, if you’re using loose leaf tea, the tea.  If you’re using matcha powder, add it to the egg mixture in the next step.  Warm the mixture over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture begins to simmer.  Lower the heat until it’s just simmering, and allow the mixture to simmer for a while so that the tea can steep, about three or four minutes.

Meanwhile, in a heatproof container, combine the egg yolks, sugar, salt, and, if you’re using matcha powder, the matcha powder.  Beat with a whisk for about two minutes until the mixture is smooth and creamy.

Prepare an ice bath, that is, a smaller container inside of a larger container that is also filled with ice water.  The smaller container must be large enough to hold the entire recipe.

Pour about one cup of the cream mixture into the bowl containing the egg mixture, and whisk until smooth.  Once that’s done, pour the egg and cream mixture back into the saucepan containing the rest of the cream mixture, whisking constantly.  Stir until the mixture has formed a custard thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.  You will know when it is ready when you dip a spoon in the mixture, draw your finger across it, and the resulting trail is not filled in immediately.  This should only take one or two minutes.  Do not allow the mixture to boil.

Place a sieve over your ice bath, and slowly pour the custard into the smaller container.  Gently press down on the tea leaves and vanilla bean in order to extract any absorbed custard.  Discard the tea leaves and vanilla bean once the entirety of the custard has been transferred into the smaller container.  Stir the custard occasionally until cool.  Cover the smaller container and refrigerate until very cold, for at least four hours.

Finally, pour the custard into an ice cream maker and follow the manufacturer’s instructions.  Once the ice cream is complete, move it into a container of your choosing and return to the freezer until ready to eat.  When serving, place the bowl lightly against Lilly’s fingers so that she knows where the bowl is.  Enjoy!

This WILL be a long post. I don’t care how you feel about this, but this is the only way I am able to completely and fully express how I feel: by throwing it all on the table. I’m sorry, I just have to.

Oh, and there's a chance that many edits will follow.

So I've been lurking on this subreddit for a couple of days, wondering whether or not I should post my story. Today, I decided to do it. I needed to do it. I've noticed that some people have used this place to vent, so I guessed that I could vent here too. I guess you get a lot of these. I didn't see any rules (if there are any to begin with) against these posts, so... yeah. 

I just have to share. I just have to share it with people who can understand. People who won’t judge me. And even then I’m still scared of posting this. But I need to share. I have to.

I'm posting this from my alt because I simply feel too ashamed to post this from my main. That, and I have the distinct feeling that some of the guys I know in real life know the name of my reddit account. Call me paranoid. It wouldn't be too far from the truth, really.

It took me some time to write this. Like, around 6 hours or so. At moments I was about to burst into tears. But I doubt school is the place to do just that. This whole post underwent massive changes. I hope the result is acceptable enough.

Please excuse me for any mistake I've made. I'm still a bit shook up and emotionally distressed. The fact that English is not my native language doesn't help either. And neither are my thoughts clear. Instead, they're... ""clouded"". You'll find out soon what I mean with that.

I originally had the intent to include my spoiler-filled dream in here that I had. However, I figured it would make the post too long and deviate from the main point of this post. But if there's any interest in it, I'll include it as an edit.

Now come. Come, and I shall show you how deep my rabbit-hole goes, and where it ends.
___
I should have seen it coming.

So. I finished KS last week. Did in three days. Perhaps too quickly. I plan on playing it again soon, don't know when though. Maybe wait a month or two, maybe three.

When I played it, I went with Lilly's route. And I loved every single bit of it. While I initially didn't cry DURING the route, I did cry a couple of days later. And when I say cry, I really mean crying for hours upon hours. About everything that happened.

The game left its mark on me. I have become emotionally wrecked. I felt this huge emptiness in me. Usually, when I finish a game, I feel satisfaction. But now... I feel nothing. Nothing but emptiness.

And then I realized. It happened to me before with a different character (although I did get over it), but not to this extent. Not this much. Not so much.

I feel a bit ashamed for saying this, but… I fell in love with Lilly. Deeply in love. She walked right into my mind, brain, heart and soul. Past all those defenses that I had set up. Defenses that should've prevented this from happening a second time. But she walked right past them.

I should have seen it coming. The moment I first saw her appear in the game, I should have seen it coming. Because I knew. At that moment I knew. Or should've known. Something in me clicked. While I hadn't decided at that point whose route I wanted to pick, I had a strong urge to take Lilly's.

And so I did.

As the game continued, I fell in love with her. And with every scene that passed I fell a little bit more in love. I treasured every single moment with her in the game. I always felt a strange sensation every time she appeared on my screen. Whenever I saw her, my heart would start racing. My mind would become clouded. I would keep thinking about her. Dreaming about her.

I should have seen it coming. I should have stopped when it became clear. But I didn't. I went further. Further down the rabbit-hole. And before I realized how far down I went and how far down it goes, it was too late.

As the third and fourth act flowed over me, I became more enamored with her.

And now, all I've got left are feelings. Feelings I don't want to have. I know she's not real. I know she's not there. I know she does not exist. Then why do I feel? Why do I fall in love with someone... something as intangible as a fictional character? As a bunch of pixels? Why does this affect me so? Why does this happen to me?

I don't know what to do. Should I embrace these feelings? If I do, wouldn’t I risk falling deeper into the rabbit-hole that I'm in? Into that dark abyss of emptiness and despair?

I once felt like this before, but not as much as this. In all these 20 years that I lived I never had a girlfriend or had a whole lot of friends. I only had rejection. I was the reject of primary school, high school and also college. Sure, I have my friends. In fact, there are several people who I consider really good friends. But all of them have a relationship. And so does my brother. And when I see them all being happy and having a good time, either with their girlfriends, friends or both, I feel sad. I feel terrible. I feel empty. I feel like something is missing.

By no means am I a social person. I try, but it is hard, especially since I have PDD-NOS. I try to change. But I don't know how. I don't know how to talk. What I do know is that I desire. But only video game characters seem to fulfill that desire, because only they seem to accept me. And even then they only do so because they are programmed to do so. And this game only made the loneliness in me grow. It made the desire to be with someone, to have that special someone, grow.

Last night, I had a dream. It was something along the lines of a lucid dream, or, at least, I think. I didn’t realize I was dreaming though, so it might as well have been a normal dream. In that dream, all the events of the end of act 4 happened. I would tell you guys the contents of this dream, but… well, should I post it here? You be the judge of that. All I can say about it is that I was there, Lilly was there, and so were Mr. Mutou, Yuuko, Kenji, Shizune and many more. Almost the entire cast was there. And I was happy there. Extremely happy. But as much as it felt I was there... I wasn't. Deep inside, I knew I wasn't. It was as if my brain was playing out every desire that I had, as if it was toying with my thoughts and feelings.

When I woke up, I felt lost and devastated. I felt horrible. I didn't want to get up. I didn't want to go to school. I wanted to fall asleep again. To dream again. To go to that special place again. Even if it was for one more time.

But I figured that moping around wasn't going to help me. I figured that doing that would only hurt me more in the long run. That things would only grow worse if I allowed it. None of it would become real, no matter how hard I would try. No matter how hard I would pretend. So I got up and went to school, taking that miserable feeling with me. As of typing this, I still feel horrible and miserable. As if I'm on the verge of crying. Because I know I miss something. And that something is something that is completely unattainable in my life. And the worst part is that I know that there’s nothing I can do to change that. I am powerless and alone, at the mercy of my own brain, which has no intent of stopping the torture anytime soon.

I simply... don't know what to do. I fell that deep in love with her. I love Lilly simply that much. And once again, I am left alone. Disappointed. Because I know that what I love is not real. And every attempt in the past to attain love has failed. I feel like that it doesn’t matter who I love, it will always be unrealistic. I feel like I'll never find any. 

I don't know what to do.

I keep asking myself these questions. The how’s and why’s.

Why didn't I see it coming?

Why did I fall in love with her?

Why did this happen to me?

How did this happen to me?

How do I get over this?

Why can’t I change?

Why didn't I stop when there was still time?

Why didn't I stop going down that rabbit-hole?

Why do these things keep happening to me?

Why me?

How can I save me from myself?

All I have is questions and no answers.

I have been thinking of practicing lucid dreaming. I heard how it helped other people out. Maybe it could help me out. That, or it potentially only makes it worse. It's a gamble. But it's a gamble I'm willing to take.

I hope you guys can help me sort out my feelings. To get over this. To get out of the shithole I’m in. Because I don't want to feel like this. I don't want to feel alone. I don't want to cry.

I should have seen it coming.

I should have stopped before it was too late.

I should have.

But I didn't.

The Director has been called ""The next Hayao Miyazak,"" which, while apt, fails to give him credit for his incredibly fresh take on the genre.

The synopsis is as follows: Told in three interconnected segments, we follow a young man named Takaki through his life as cruel winters, cold technology, and finally, adult obligations and responsibility converge to test the delicate petals of love.

I hope that some people on the sub here can attest to the beauty of this movie, since I'm sure we have a few anime fans here as well.

Also, please up-vote for visibility, its a self-post!

1342165433.0	whn28	I kinda broke myself.	Angry_Peanut	60	14	12	"I want to start off with saying that this is more or less a pointless post. I don't expect any miraculous advice, or even for anyone to care much past posting an encouraging reply, if even that. I just kind of need to vent and here is as good a place as any. Sorry for wasting your time if you view it that way.

To be honest this isn't even entirely KS related, it's just what started the whole thing and I feel more comfortable here than in /visualnovels. Anyway, I guess I should just get to the point at hand.

During spring break a couple months back I was bored out of my mind and browsing The Escapist website, looking for something to read. I found an article about Katawa Shoujo. Being bored and generally open minded (I had been a brony for nearly a year at that point, but that's beside the point), I decided to give it a try. I was not prepared. To give a little background info on myself, I'm pretty much the archetypal lonely nerd. For as long as I can remember, I've been told I was a 'gifted' student. I was never really sure of what that meant, I just found school to be easy, I didn't get why some found it difficult. I'd always been outgoing enough and never afraid to try and make friend with strangers, but still I never really had what I would call a close friend. I'm an only child, and though I have both parents, and they love and care for me with all their heart, and I am extremely grateful for that caring, I still find it very difficult to connect with them. My problems have always been my own, out of a desire to keep from bothering others. My secrets, desires, opinions, difficulties, I've never really been able to share them openly with anybody. Growing up, I realized that I was a bit lonely, but I've never had any idea how to get that close to someone. It was my Junior year at a public high school, and since freshman year I had become progressively less social and more inclined to stay at home. That year in particular, I had grown distant from nearly everyone, and I can count on my hands the number of times I left my house to do something after school or on the weekend. To make matters worse, I've always been a hopeless romantic idealist prove to falling in 'love' too easily. Needless to say, things haven't worked out for me very well. To this day I've never been in a romantic relationship, and not for lack of effort. Of course this left me quite lonely and hungry for some form of love any way I could get it. Katawa Shoujo was my ""perfect storm"" in a sense.

It took my about a week to get through my first playthrough, ending with the good Emi ending. When I realized that the story was over, realization truly hit for the first time that this was just a work of fiction. The time I spent reading about and getting attached to these character was fruitless and meaningless, and it just made my hollow lonely feelings grow. It wasn't the first time I was saddened by my lack of a social life, but for some reason this time around it hit harder than usual. Seeking to relive some of the happiness I found with Emi, I went back and played the good route for Lilly. Then Hanako. Then Rin. When I ran out of new experiences in Katawa Shoujo, I did some digging and moved on to other VN's. I've still never had it in me to go back and play through any bad endings. But, visual novels have become a form of escapism for me. As long as I'm reading a story I can forget about myself, I can experience some amount of what it's like to love someone and have your feelings returned.

I don't know what to do. When I finish a vn, I can usually be happy for a few hours, before I remind myself that it hasn't changed anything and I'm still alone. I've wasted half my summer in my room, thinking and thinking about what I could do to make myself better, wondering what it is about myself that makes me so undesirable. I've tried going outside, during the 4th of July I attended the carnival. I saw crowds of people, enjoying themselves with their friends, and I felt more lonely than ever. I spent four hours wandering through the crowds, hoping someone would reach out to me. I've wasted most of my adolescence, and I will never be able to get the lost opportunities back, but I have no idea what to do. Thanks for sticking by and reading if you've made it this far. Sorry again for wasting your time otherwise. Like I said, I just needed to get this out somewhere."	t5_2tb50	True

So we browse the store for a while, when I stumble upon a music box. I chuckle to my self, and completely reminded of Lilly's route I open it. 
It started playing the same fucking song.
I even compared it with the sound track I have on my phone.
I just started crying right there in the store.
So I closed the box, and went out side for some air, it was 20,000 yen, so i couldn't buy it. I spent the rest of the day thinking about that god damn music box, and how wonderful Lilly's route was."	t5_2tb50	True

We've formed a team, created a setting, and now have six separate routes outlined for our working-title ""Souls without Salaries."" The premise is something I'm sure a good few of us are familiar with - it deals with the ups and downs of unemployment, and the myriad of new experiences such a time brings. Our main character will go about finding a solid career, and come to form some new friendships in the process. Or maybe even a lasting relationship.

If you're interested in following our progress or just giving some feedback, drop a line over in the Guest Room [here](http://mumei.forumotion.com/f7-guest-room). We plan to open up an IRC to the public soon, in addition to the forum we've got in place. Recruitment is still available, though at this point we are likely only capable of accepting artists, website management specialists, and a few other odd positions. Ask all the same, and we'll try to see if an option is open.

Thanks again, everybody. This is an ambitious endeavor, and we've all accepted the challenge it brings. We hope that you'll back us as we go down this road."	t5_2tb50	True

finishing katawa shoujo for the first time hits pretty hard on me.i choosed hanako's route and felt somehow really conected to it.

my first love was back then when i was in middle high school.i wasn't popular,i wasn't good at sports and i liked alot of girls back then. 

but...there was one girl that would just go silent in class being scared to open up to society.she was scared and i guess cant really talk to anyone seriously. i fell in love with her and try to aproach her knowing that she will just ignore me. i tried asking for her number, but it always ends up making her shut down or just walk away. curiousity grows and i kept trying to get her atenttion. tried to talk to her during lunch breaks but it always ends up just like when i was asking for her number. i tried to give up asking for her number but i guess i just cant manage giving up on her, she still have many things to see in this world. everyday i would just wait for her in the front gate just to see her pass by me like i was just somekind of trash that always stands still. i usually eat lunch at the cafeteria but then i just bring my lunchbox and ate in front of my class waiting for her to come out off her class. when the last bell for the day rings i would just rush to the front gate and wait for her to go home just to take the same treatment i get from waiting for here to come to school.

her car usually waits in front of the gate so she can just go home without waiting for anything.but one day,she forgot to bring her cellphone and her car isent anywhere to be seen so she went back inside school and waited for her car too come. the school was empty and the teachers went home early today.it was one of the bigeest chance for me,so i dident want to miss it. i started to walk to her and she noticed it right away.she seems calmer then usual so i asked the first question that came through my mind ""so...where's your car?"" she smiled and replied ""i dont know where it is...and i forgot to bring my cellphone"" she smiled a little.i still dident believe that she answered my question. i told her that i remembered her car plate number and asked her if she wants me to look for it in the parking lot.she refuses but then smiles and answers ""i'll search my car with you"" .we went to search her car and finally finding it.inside that car was the sight of her driver sleaping -____- .she thanked me and went inside her car without saying anything else. the next day i asked her  number again hoping that the little encounter is going to help.and it did. i finally got her number and the feeling was one of the best feeling i ever had.

i will always call her everynight and i feel that we get closer as each day passed like it was nothing.she started to open up to me,and told me that the reason of her being scared was because of her thought of her friends leaving her alone again.she feels that if one day her friends will end up leaving her then there is no point of having friends at all.

i never give up trying to make her change her mind.and after about 6 months she started talking to other people and become really social. it was amazing to see someone changed her way of life and changing his/her personality like that. soon,me and her and her friend (i'll just call her mia) became best friends and just like lilly and hisao, our feeling to protect her was really big. i never told her the truth, the truth that i truly do love her with all my heart.

she started to like someone,but that someone isent me.she will always tell me first, about the boy that she likes and and talks about him everyday.it made my heart shattered.but that was not the worst.on 7th november (forgot what year),she became that boy's girlfriend and told me first about it.i was happy for her and i dont have any intention to tell her that i love her.i just dont want to her smile that i search for so long disappear.

i never talked to her again untill i finished middle high school. it was painfull to see someone you love not by your side.back before she went out with him,she said that she was going to the same highschool as me.but no. she dident. she told me that she was transfering into another school...with her boyfriend.

i cried because even when she was with him,at least i can see her everyday,smiling.but now...i cant.seeing her smile means a lot to me.it really does!!! .she told me to meet her in her house (she was going to move out her house too) i tried holding my tears walking inside her house.

she smiled but her face also looked sad at the same time and sayed sorry that she's going to leave me.she cried and told me not to give up. i was puzzled about her sudenly saying not to give up to me.

she stopped for a while still crying and gave me a jar of stars she made by herself http://imgur.com/9L6BD (i'm sorry if the pictured sucked.i dont have any good cameras) and then she told me...

""love is like stars,even if you see it shining as it is now,you never know when it really shines dont you? it could be from a million years ago or it could be the shine from yesterday.but...eventually that shining star will be gone and all you can see are the other stars surrounding it.you will try to find it but you just cant.and soon enough you will find other stars,stars that shine brighter than the last star you saw.the star that will always be there for you. that big blue star is me,and the other big blue star is you. i know you love me...and i'm telling you that i love you too... but there is just something missing,something i dont know yet. but all i know is that true love will always be there no matter what.even if you cant see it,you just know that it's there""

that was a long time ago and katawa shoujo reminded me about that memory again

when i played katawa shoujo, i always choose something based on my heart and ended up with hanako. as i continue with the story i ended up getting just the normal ending for hanako...and being her friend...and just that. it harshly reminded me about my love story in middle school. i tried palying act 4 again and got the good ending eventually.i cried. it made  me relize that i was to selfish,i was to ignorant i was only thinking about her and never thaught about the things she thinks about me.i never saw it from her point of view.i liked her so much back then that it made me forget what true love really means.

true love doesnt mean that it must be there to be seen.it can be anywhere but you just cant see it,but you know that it's there. 

even if i dont know where she is now .i will always love her no matter what. because i know that somewhere i dont know where lol she's feeling the same way

katawa shoujo made me relize that. so thank you 4 leaf studio for making such a great game :)

I finished Lilly's path in tears and I realized that I had cried for the first time in a very long time.
