1334507481.0	sax87	I'm a Jew, I love Israel, but do not blindly support it at the expense of others		67	13	68	"I was born in the US, I was raised Jewish, now I'm only culturally, not religiously Jewish.

I have never felt oppressed, or had my rights violated. My Jewish side of the family is from Lithuania, I come from a long line of rabbis, they are all dead, only my part of the family in the US is still alive. I know that anti-Semitism exists, but it is not a threat to me.

If Israel had existed as a Jewish state before, my Lithuanian relatives would still be alive.

But...

**Kinda big edit I didn't think about earlier:** Miko Peled was a family friend of ours growing up, while I knew I liked Judaism, Israel was something I didn't put much thought into then, but I knew that there were respectable people who worked towards peace by understanding both sides. In the end I don't agree that Israel needs to be a Jewish State in order to protect Jewish interests, especially in this context. A one-state solution is really what I support.

I do not blindly support Israel, it is not a perfect democracy, previous oppression and current hatred against Jews doesn't justify human rights violations by Jews, and I know Israel continually violates international agreements for the sake of demonstrating their own power. If we, as Jews, are supposed to be better than everyone else, why are we against taking the high road, being gracious, extending a peaceful hand? Why do we value Jewish life and rights but not the lives and rights of all humans, all of the oppressed?

I do not believe Israel belongs to the Jews, even if I think it should be protect Jewish interests. I think that Zionism is harmful and another form of extreme nationalism. I think that it makes people unwilling to compromise, rationalizes settlements, encourages oppression to ensure constant, complete security, makes people unwilling to make any concessions, and makes the whole issue into a religious, not a political one. It makes people close-minded.

I am sick and tired of being called anti-Israel because I think Palestine should have UN representation or that Israel is perpetuating conflict in the region through its policies. I'm sick and tired of being called an anti-Semite for believing that Israel doesn't belong to the Jews, it belongs to the Israelis, or for acknowledging that the creation of Israel was done somewhat arbitrarily and with the knowledge that it would create conflict in the region. I'm sick and tired of being told that my opinion is uninformed because I don't live in Israel. I'm sick and tired of being fed lies about how Arabs/Muslims/Palestinians are all hateful of Jews, dangerous, uneducated, or unethical (I've had enough friendly conversations with cab drivers, many of them Arabs, to know that many of them just want to make a good life for their children, not harm others based on their religion or race).

Most of all, I'm scared that I have been called a ""sympathizer"" because I don't blindly acknowledge that Palestinians are just there as a ""pawn"" for other Arab nations, or that I believe Palestine is a legitimate state, or that Arabs and Jews and others have lived in the region for centuries, and no one group has a complete claim to the region. If I was alive in Germany in 1939, would I be labeled as a Jew Sympathizer? If I lived in the South and was against slavery, would I be labeled a Negro Sympathizer? If I lived in Iran would I not be labeled as an Israel Sympathizer?

I know everyone is born a human, I know that religious extremism on both sides is a problem, I know that the way Israel is doing it is wrong and they have the upper hand, but it has positive results for Israelis and Jews so it meets little protest with them.

I protest Israel not to the exclusion of Syria, Iran, Hamas, etc., but because I know that there is a chance that my voice will not fall on deaf ears in Israel. I know that my opinions can elicit change. I protest Israel because I love Israel, and people I care about live there, just like you would protest a friend who was putting himself in danger. I am tired of hearing that because other countries are worse, my criticism of Israel is baseless.

I do not want to see a country that I love go down a road of extreme nationalism tied to a racial identity (a familiar and troubling combination), and violently oppress a minority on the basis of biblical entitlements, previous oppression, and vilification of a Palestinians in general because of the actions of a few. I do not want to, in 10 years, see that fear of being called anti-Semitic in the wake of the holocaust led people to overlook another oppression."	t5_2qhak	True

&gt;9:59 P.M. Rocket alert sounds in Kiryat Malakhi and Ashdod.

&gt;9:28 P.M. Two rockets fired toward Eshkol Regional Council, land in open areas.

&gt;9:13 P.M. IDF and Shin Bet strike home in Khan Younis belonging to a top Islamic Jihad leader. IDF claims it carried out strike before the cease-fire went into effect, while Hamas claims it occured afterward.

&gt;9:10 P.M. Four rockets land in open areas in Sha'ar Hanegev and Eshkol Regional Council. Iron Dome intercepts Grad rocket above Be'er Sheva.

&gt;9:05 P.M. Four Grad rockets fired toward Be'er Sheva, one intercepted.

&gt;9:00 P.M. Gaza-Israel cease-fire goes into effect. 

I'm a leftist. I want a truce. I want peace. But it seems clear to me that Hamas broke the truce terms.

What are your thoughts on that, /r/Palestine ? Is there something you want to add?

On April 9, 1948 Zionist paramilitary groups attacked Deir Yassin killing over 100 Palestinians including women and children. According to Israeli historian Benny Morris after the massacre took place many others including women and children were taken prisoner and paraded through the streets of West Jerusalem where they were spat on and stoned and then finally killed. A year later the Jewish neighborhood of Givat Shaul was built upon the ruins of Deir Yassin. 

This has made Deir Yassin a symbol of the greater Palestinian dispossession. (also known as the Nakba) For Israel was built upon the suffering of the Palestinian people, the destruction of their villages, and theft of their lands. A fact that Israel continues to deny to this very day."	t5_2qhak	True

Still, you guys don't need to support the ""nationalistic"" conflict between your military leaders. By doing so, by propagating the belief that your side is absolutely in its right and you are just being used as yet another tool.

If you want to live in peace then prove it. Stop supporting those that promote conflict and constantly point fingers saying ""they started it"". Nobody knows and/or cares anymore.

You are **never** going to win, either of you. You probably know that. At least not if you keep biting each other to death.

I can't take it anymore, all this violence topped with insults online and stupid hateful ignorant memes, cartoons and other forms of hate propaganda.
When ""something happens"" you suddenly pull out facts, links,  and quotes to justify some kid getting shot in the face.

Sometimes I almost feel like I want you guys to kill each other for good and be done with you.

To start those who follow the events comfortably sitting thousands of miles away from any actual rockets or even sand, could you stop adding to the problem ? The conflict doesn't need more hate. There are constructive discussions out there, they give me some sort of hope, but they are too rare.

To those who live in the affected areas, could you not blame a whole population for decisions and actions made by a few trigger happy assholes ? Could you also not support those assholes ?

Could we see Israelis offering housing to Palestinians made homeless ? Can you guys show the world that your leaders are quite possibly committing serious war crimes and you do not support them, on either side ?

To those who actually do this sort of thing, you are incredible super heroes and I want to hug you to near death.

For the love of Jesus, Mohammed and Moses, and Darwin too, please stop being war tools, stop promoting this endless conflict.

I joined this wonderful team of professors and doctors whose aim is to build the biomedical research infrastructure in Palestine. With the countless hours we put into this project, we currently have 3 published papers, and 3 more in the pipeline.

One of our greatest accomplishments is securing 4 rotation spots in Neurology, Neurosurgery, Internal Medicine and Psychiatry at one of the best US hospitals (Ill mention the name to those interested) for 4 medical school students, as well as lab rotations at many distinguished institutions. 

Expanding the sciences in a developing country is very difficult on a shoe string budget, and I wanted to reach out to r/Palestine for help in finding some donors for our program. I have a more complete proposal and list of accomplishments for those who want. I can also provide my cell number, and email address for those interested in learning more or donating. We have a 501c3 account set up with the Rutgers Foundation. 

go to neuroscience.med.alquds.edu for more info, I am currently working on updating the website as well.

Please PM me for more details, suggestions, comments, feedback, etc.

I can understand hating the country, but do you guys hate somebody that committed the crime of being born in Israel?

Please don't turn this into a ""hurr durr"" thread

EDIT: I don't think if I made this clear. I've had fights with my parents and friends over the whole Israel/Palestine issue, I fully support the 1967 borders with Jerusalem as an international entity controlled by the UN (that way everybody gets everything), but only if we are 100% sure that we will not get attacked once we make peace (either with a demilitarized state or with a government that obviously does not want to kill us). I think that I am as neutral as you can be, ask me anything if you want to

EDIT 2: OF COURSE that I condemn the settlements and how the Government treats the Pallys (I thought that went without saying) but I equally condemn the people that make a party when an Israeli Sbarro's is bombed. **The color of your skin or who you pray to does not matter to me, if you like me I'll invite you to my house and I'll make you coffee, but if you want to kill me/my family/my friends I'll kill you first.** I think that's a good way of seeing any conflict"	t5_2qhak	True

Here on reddit I found one dead subreddit with nearly, but not quite, the right definitions (r/IsraelPalestine) , and the /r/israel and /r/palestine are obviously not meant for that.

So my question is whether anyone knows of an online community of Israelis and Palestinians, that focuses on getting people from across the border to know each other rather than to argue politics.

If an active one can't be found, would anyone here like to help start a subreddit for this purpose?"	t5_2qhak	True

&gt; Israel called the vote a ""tragedy"" and the decision damaged relations between UNESCO and the United States, an ally of Israel that provides about 22 percent of the body's funding, or some $70 million. [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/lvfx6/unesco_grants_palestinians_full_membership/)

Not all American citizens feel this way. That the United States is allowing something like people being included in the world community and furthering their goal of self-determination to damage relations with those people is confusing and horrifying. I know many Americans who support the Palestinians cause and would not agree with the Federal government's position on this UNESCO vote. 

Palestine, Americans **do** stand with you, whether our government sees it the same way or not. Don't let them push you around.

I've studied the Israel-Palestine struggle for a bit now and I have several questions for this board, preferably from actual Palestinians. 

Firstly, tell me a little about yourselves. What is your experience with this issue? Do you have family in Palestine or were expelled from Palestine/abused by Israel?

What is the specific goal of the Palestinian struggle? Does ""end the occupation"" mean the West Bank and Gaza, or all of Israel/Palestine? 

Would a Palestinian state be theocratic or secular? Would Israeli Jews be able to live in the area, particularly in the holy cities like Jerusalem and Hebron, or would they be forced to leave or even at risk of genocide/some kind of sectarian civil war?

Can there be room for multiple states rather than one Palestinian state or one Zionist state? Like Jewish, Christian and Muslim entities?

Is the ""Right of Return"" realistic given that that whole area is already quite overpopulated and running out of water?

Is the Palestinian flag racist, since it represents Arab nationalism, and does it exclude non-Arabs?

Would Palestine be a nation of it's own, part of Egypt, or part of some kind of pan-Arab caliphate? Does it matter?

Are there alternatives to Hamas and Fatah? Since neither one seems to be in the best interest of the Palestinian people.

Thanks"	t5_2qhak	True

I am an only child and was raised in the US' mid-west. The most I know about Levantine culture is through their cooking, which my dad was very passionate about. I do not speak any Arabic more than basic phrases such as ""I love you,"" ""I hate milk,"" and ""that's crazy."" I visited for a month at the age of nine, but all I remember was poking at scorpions with my cousin, hating the dumb Christian sites we visited because of my mom, and getting a little desensitized to gunfire.

I am in my mid-20s and have not had a strong relationship with my dad's side of the family because he has kept a distance from them for reasons he absolutely refuses to get into. I've met the major family members (aunts, uncles, and their children who are much older than me) only a few times on very stilted terms.

I've been dating the man that I will soon marry for two years now. He's culturally Jewish but not religious and hates politics. However, I've gotten many texts, emails, and facebook posts with links depicting youtube videos of extreme Zionism from my family. 

I've tried talking to my father about this and he has just given me a terrifying look and told me to never speak of it again. He loves my fiance, but has told me explicitly to not contact the family if I ""want a happy life.""

How do I respond to this? I want to connect with my family and learn more about my and my father's culture (which I've been trying to do on my own, but not knowing Arabic, I feel I am losing out on much) but I also have no idea how to broach the subject without getting my father's affairs.

Both my father and my fiance have told me that I'm ""not really Palestinian."" I have no idea what this means but I am extremely insulted by it. How do I respond?

**TL;DR:** American girl who's half Palestinian looking into culture - even worse, dating a Jewish boy. "	t5_2qhak	True

power"	NonZionist	17	3	39	"This post is inspired, in part, by the eloquence of the women who have taken up the defense of the Palestinian people.  See my comment [here](/r/NewIsrael/comments/nxwmy/who_said_israel_has_a_right_to_exist/).

The Iranian effort to avert war relies on diplomacy based on reason.

The U.S. / Israel effort to initiate war relies on theater -- with Iran cast as Insane Supervillain and the U.S. cast as the White Knight.  

Iranian diplomacy, however brilliant, will fail, because reason is constrained by reality and theater is unconstrained.  

* The U.S. has shown a complete disregard for reality.  ""Iranian Nukes"" are no more real than ""Iraqi WMDs"", yet the U.S. makes ""Iranian Nukes"" the focus of its propaganda assault.  

* The U.S. also shows complete disregard for its own interests.  Attacking Iran will double the price of oil and tank the U.S. economy.  Countless lives will be lost, including many American lives, and another trillion dollars or more will go up in smoke, all to achieve nothing.  

* The U.S. has shown no interest in diplomacy.  Iran has offered numerous [conciliatory proposals](http://www.iranaffairs.com/iran_affairs/2011/11/iran-offered-to-recognize-israel-in-2003.html) that attempt to address nuclear concerns.  Most of these proposals are instantly dismissed by the U.S. and Israel.  At one point, the U.S. was forced to reject its own proposal, when Iran agreed to it.  At another point, Iran accepted a proposal by Brazil and Turkey and the U.S. torpedoed it.

U.S. politicians, it seems, have only one aim in life, and that is to obey their sponsors in Tel Aviv.  Since 2002, Israel has been ordering the U.S. to attack Iran, and the U.S. is eager to comply, no matter what the cost to America and the world.  Under the trance of suicidal bellicosity, the U.S. is marching straight into the sea of war and madness.  

Diplomacy based on reason is powerless to stop this lemming-like march.  The lemming just covers its ears.  I see only one way to break this war trance: Iran must fight the U.S. propaganda theater with theater of its own.  

In particular, Iran must obliterate the Archvillain or Demon stereotype.  And it can do that in an instant, simply by putting women in positions of power.  The chief negotiator, for example, should be a woman.  

The U.S. and Israel want to annilate Iran for one reason: Iran rejects global domination by the Ziosphere.  The need to dominate the world is what drives Israel and the U.S..  

That need for domination is a male game, a manifestation of patriarchy -- one cave-man bashing in the skulls of rival cave-men.  That is the dynamic behind U.S. foreign policy, these days.  The dynamic depends on the existence of rival cave-men.  When there are no rivals to bash or club to death, the U.S. is at a loss.  

Because the U.S. treats negotiations only as a launching pad for war, there is no chance that Iran's male diplomats will make progress towards averting war.  A female diplomat could not do worse.  

But the presence of the woman in a position of power would enable Iran to combat the theater of the war-makers.  The cave-man versus cave-men script would no longer work.  The U.S. would have to come up with a new script for war-making, and it would be a far weaker script.  In the meantime, the popular opposition to the insanity of war-making would continue to grow, and might become strong enough to actually influence the rulers in this ""Democracy"".

The demonstration was a splendid success, with ca. 1000 people showing up and, as such, constituting quite possibly the largest demonstration outside of the U.S. embassy to date. This may sound like a really shitty and low number to people from big countries, but the street was rather crowded.

Among the speakers was the interior minister of the Icelandic government and Left-Green Party who condemned the Israeli actions and took a much more ""hardline"" stance than the foreign minister who ""condemned both parties"" (or something). The finance minister, who is the leader of the Left-Greens, was spotted in the crowd.

A Palestinian held a passionate speech condemning the attacks, Zionism and U.S. complicity in genocide, and told everyone about hearing from his relatives in Gaza who were being bombed and how scared everyone was etc. 

Here are photographs from the event. All credit goes to the photographer, and not myself: www.demotix.com/news/1614566/rally-solidarity-palestinians-held-reykjavik#media-1614550

I kid you not, there was audible laughter and snorts from all around the room when they said this."	monkeyfacee	18	7	10	"Today during a major international conference, a draft resolution was presented on the situation of women in Palestine. 

Only two countries voted against the resolution: Canada and the USA. After that, Israel delivered a statement, starting off by saying that “This resolution has no place in this forum, it is biased, unhelpful, and one-sided”. I kid you not, there was audible laughter and snorts from all around the room when they said this. 

In its statement, Israel did not speak to any of the allegations of human rights abuses it has been accused of, nor the fact that there are numerous UN resolutions condemning their actions. Israel holds the record for ignoring UN Security Council Resolutions. Israel has violated nearly 100 UN General Assembly resolutions, and 28 UN Security Council resolutions. This webpage has an easy to follow breakdown of Israel’s violations of UN resolutions, as well as an advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice on the issue of the separation wall in the West Bank. Israel is also the first country in the history of the UN to boycott the Human Rights Council and refuse to participate in its Universal Periodic Review (UPR), which is an overview of the human rights situation in a given country. I find it strange that instead of defending their own actions that have been condemned internationally, and on many occasions, Israel’s strategy is to refer to resolutions related to Palestine “biased, unhelpful, and one-sided”.

The one-state solution?	voodoochild312	16	5	24	"By my estimation, we've reached a point where the two state solution will never work.  With permanent settlements (which will mean a continued Israeli military presence in a Palestinian state), Israel's dividing the West Bank up into Bantustans, and the probability that Israel will demand that Palestine be demilitarized I don't think what comes out of that is a ""state.""  It would lack the necessary sovereignty and autonomy.

I am well away that Israel (especially its right-wing) would very likely reject a secular/democratic one state solution due to the ""demographic threat,"" but I wanna know what you guys think about it."	t5_2qhak	True

Note that Google translate made a few major errors in translation that completely undermined the description of the events so please check the original Hebrew text carefully before complaining about mistranslations.

**Tourists Beaten at the Allenby Crossing to be Compensated with ILS 166,000 ($42,000)**

The Jerusalem Magistrate's Court decided two weeks ago that a Palestinian born American citizen and her son, who entered Israel from Jordan via the Allenby crossing, and were beaten by security guards, will receive compensation of ILS 166 thousand ($42,000). While the court granted them compensation, it did not conclude that the security guards, who are employees of the *Israeli Airport Authority* and a private security company *Security Systems*, acted negligently or violated security procedures.

The incident occurred in July 2006, when Hanuna Tina George, a native of Beit Sahour in the West Bank who now lives in the United States, came to Jordan with her 16-year-old son, Michael Shaheen. They wanted to enter Israel via the Allenby Bridge, but the personnel of *Security Systems* suspected that the son was a terrorist before they entered security. The mother and son claimed that one of the guards approached Shaheen shouting and waving his hands, but the son did not respond since he speaks no Hebrew nor Arabic. The son claimed that he did not know that this person was a security guard and was afraid that he was trying to steal his music player from his pocket. The mother began shouting and the guard punched her in the face and hit her son. Shaheen claimed that the security guard threw him onto the floor and threw away the card he presented that states that he suffers from a heart condition. He said that another security guard then came and hit him. A third guard cocked his gun and aimed it at the mother's head, yelling at her to shut up and threatened that if she spoke, he would shoot her. The medical report submitted to the court showed that she suffered a broken nose and required hospital treatment.

The two were then handcuffed and taken into a side room. Some time later, one of the guards apologized to them and said that they could complain to the police. One of the managers of the terminal even offered them financial compensation. They filed a police complaint, but a month later the police closed the case with the justification that there was no case to answer. In 2008 the two instructed a lawyer — Shlomo Lecker — to sue the *Israel Airport Authority* for damages. The *Israel Airport Authority* argued that it is not liable for damages, since the security guards acted according to the standard police and *Shin-Bet* procedures. *Security Systems* argued that *""the guards had immunity, since this was a wartime action""*."	t5_2qhak	True

So wouldn't it make sense to make peace now while the two state solution is still viable?	mystical-me	8	2	18	"I got my number of 1,000,000 pretty simply. The west Bank settler population has doubled between 1999-2012, a period of the 13 years, from 180,000 to 360,000 people. For there to be a [doubling time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubling_time) of 13 years there must be a growth rate of 5.5% in the West Bank. In [2012](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/02/13/israeli-west-bank-settlers-increase-by-4-7-percent-in-2012/) the growth rate for west bank settlers was considered to be 4.7%, a doubling time of 15 years. so if the growth rate continued as it has been, the West Bank Settler population 720,000 by 2025-2027. 

In East Jerusalem the population increased by an average of 2600 people between [2000-2010](http://www.fmep.org/reports/archive/vol.-22/no.-4/chart-settler-population-in-east-jerusalem-2000-2010) to around 200,000+ people in 2010. If the East Jerusalem population went on at an increase of 2600 between 2011-2027, would be an increase of 44,200 people. Though the New E1 plan intends to build enough housing for 45,000 people for that many people in one area in anticipation of even farther growth.
