I found an interesting way to make a hidden passage with signs and paintings, since paintings can be placed on signs (even the edge of it, as shown here), and paintings can be passed through.

http://imgur.com/fqmLx.png

Another use of ""Painting Security"" (Hidden Switches)

http://imgur.com/dHbDD.png

It's kind of hard to understand whats happening from the pictures, so I'll explain it some

Wooden pressure plates can be activated when throwing items on them (most people probably know this)

Paintings can be placed directly on the edge of the pressure plate (where the cursor is in the pic), which will hide it

Objects can be thrown through paintings, which allows you to activate the door

These concepts can also be combined, making it so even if people run into the painting they wont be able to tell there is an entrance there, let alone where the button is all with one painting if you wanted

1305320340.0	haty8	Making minecart stations is my favorite part of Minecraft. Here is the culmination of every station I've ever made, before it is rendered useless by 1.6: Simple Minecart Station V.4	Mandalf_The_White	41	6	10	"I set out to make a station for my SMP server with three objectives in mind.

1) It had to be simple to use so as to not intimidate any players on my server.
2) It had to be fully featured and adapted for multiple (simultaneous) users.
3) It had to be as ""clean"" as possible, with all the inner-workings hidden away underground.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/f4GNy.jpg) is a an overview of the station. It's not pretty, nor is it compact; the total size of the schematic is 42 x 55 x 15. If you wish, the sandstone exterior can be changed to stone or dirt or whatever with McEdit. 

Features:

* Simply get in the [cart](http://i.imgur.com/c8iO1.png) and you're on your way; no need to press any buttons.
* [4 destination selector](http://i.imgur.com/VDMaf.png).
* A new cart is brought out when one leaves the station, ensuring there is always one waiting for the next rider.
* Runaway cart detection: carts without a rider are sent back to the dispenser.
* [3 Incoming cart areas](http://i.imgur.com/Krwkm.jpg). When coming into the station, you are directed to the first unoccupied area. Once you arrive and get out of your cart, another cart comes along and takes the cart you arrived in away (i.e., you may stay in your cart as long as you wish, but the moment you get out, it will be taken away to the dispenser).
* Fully featured [maintenance room](http://imgur.com/a/2W3ty).

For those interested, download [here](http://www.mediafire.com/?hdfos1b6s35vm7b).

PS: Please note that in my title, I was not complaining about Notch fixing the boosters bug; I realize that it had to be fixed eventually in order for new, more refined methods of minecart handling to take its place."	t5_2s5j6	True

This will take advantage of a few tricks:

1: When you log off, and something is blocking the point you logged off at, you are set ""on top of"" whatever is there (to the next highest spot in the Y direction that you can stand on).

2: While in a mine cart, you can be ""inside"" of a half block without taking damage.



Because you are placed on the nearest Y above you, this can only be used to travel up (but when paired with falling into water from above, it makes for extremely fast upward and downward travel).  In order to determine where you will be teleported to, line up the X and Z coordinates with where you want to go and the teleporter, and also make sure all spaces between the teleporter and the ""landing zone"" can't fit a player (just make a pillar).



In the picture is a mine cart wedged between 2 blocks with a half block and pillar over it.  After entering the mine cart just simply log out then back in to instantly travel upward through the ceiling."	t5_2s5j6	True

My recent submission [Tileable Smart Furnace](http://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftInventions/comments/x6yww/tileable_smart_furnace/) had quite a lot of upvotes, much more than I expected really. Thanks everyone.

Now I'm back for an update on the topic with a lot more compact design of it. One cell is 4x5x1, still tileable of course. Better, cheaper, faster.

And as a gift for all the upvotes I also included another design with a bell (can be disabled). It rings when you start cooking something and more importantly anytime a furnace stop burning.

1365625853.0	1c34z4	Fellow inventors, what are your thoughts on automation? Here are mine.	attosama	26	5	16	"Hands down, one of the things I love about the redstone update is the ability to semi/automate: sorting, brewing, chicken and sugar cane.

**The three main points:** 

That I'd like to make for automation are: is that it's **fun** to build and engineer, extraordinarily **satisfying** when you have to work for the resources in survival to build it, and makes it feel like there is **a way to beat the game**. 


- **Fun**

For the longest time the only thing that we could really automate was mob grinders and cobble generators, and sometimes Mojang made them harder to build, but they only beaome more fun to engineer. (Mobs don't move if you aren't near them? Built a water system with a timer to push them to their death). 


- **Satisfying**

Hours of obtaining iron and redstone, I never really ran out until: I built a sorting system for over forty items, multiple item elevators, and other systems that required timed farming. It felt satisfying to have a use for all that redstone and iron I mined, which brings me to my final point. 


- **Beating the game**


Having a way of overcoming obstacles makes the game feel more complete, and you have to work fairly hard and spend a fair number of hours to do some of what I listed above. Of course you'll never truly beat the game, because you can always just *build*. The fun of building in survival is it comes with some risks and dangers, and sometimes great losses; beating the game for me is minimizing those risks. 

---

**My Suggestions** 


I'd personally like to see a way to: plant seeds and saplings with dispensers, we've already seen some intense designs for tree farms, and the argument that automating these things would be too easy just simply [isn't true](http://imgur.com/a/3gDD0); collecting charcoal from burned trees set on fire; dispensers that use tools until they break, something like this would need to be occasionally replaced so that it isn't OP; collecting snowballs with water again, it drives me nuts now that we have hoppers to connect to dispensers, that this can't be done.


**The two big things I DON'T want to see added**

You should always have to **Mine** and **Craft** on your own. We should never see robots that mine for you, even if they have fuel or their tools break. And there should never be a way to have things crafted for you. 

I don't want to see the game play itself, the above are ideas I consider to be the limit of automation, while still making you play the game to run it all. 

---

P.S.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, I know it's a bit long.

And I've posted this in [suggestions](http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1aljri/argument_for_more_potential_automation/) before and it did well, but I want to hear  your thoughts now.  

---

Edit: Regarding auto-crafting,

I've seen a lot of good arguments for auto-crafting, but at the moment I'm 50/50. On one hand the resources and time it would require to build would very well be worth the reward, and on the other hand is that it would truly be 100% automation, and the purpose of my topic was to prove to Jeb and DB is that they could add a few more things to dispensers without this happening."	t5_2s5j6	True
