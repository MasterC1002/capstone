Music, a non-profit website dedicated to promoting aspiring bands and musicians in order to shed light on the talent buried in the underground 	jpw123	8	3	5	"Okay guys, I'm Jeremiah Walton, manager of Nostrovia! Poetry, a small, independent publishing press.  Over the past year, I've debated the idea of creating another website, this time, rather than poetry, dedicated to music.  I've begun organizing the website Nostrovia! Music.  The site's goal is to provide a platform on which bands and musicians can be promoted, for free.  Sound too good to be true?  We'll it's true.  My goal is to have the site up by this summer, but in order to do that, I need content.  That's where you guys come in.  If you have a band, or know anyone seeking promotion, Nostrovia! Music is seeking all genres to promote.  I've always appreciated music, but never had a knack for it.  This website is my contribution to the music industry.  I currently have a [FB page for Nostrovia! Music](http://www.facebook.com/NostroviaMusicPromotion), which all artists are welcome to like, and post links to their own FB pages, band camps, reverbnations, websites, or wherever good music and talent is displayed.  Personal bias against genres does not disqualify you from posting.  I'm not particularly a fan of dubstep, but by all means, if you're a dubstep artist, promote your work.  This is a home for all musicians.  The main difference between N!M and other music promotional websites is that N!M is free to be a part of.  Your band page consists of links to outside content of yours (the band's), interviews, bios, and other forms of media.  I'm pretty lenient if there are particular aspects I haven't listed that you'd like included.  Nostrovia! Music is seeking bands and musicians interested, and if you are, email me at nostroviamusic@aol.com with your band name, genre, brief bio, and any links to content you have online. Cheers!

-Jeremiah Walton

This is our debut album, 10 tracks in all. If you have specific questions about the music, band, or even myself, ask away! If you wanna see us live, ask me about shows, or request us! We need all the help we can get, and I'd appreciate ANY and all help and listens.

This is my uncle's band from Perth, Western Australia. He's been working on this song on and off for the last ten years about one of his friends that died in a car accident while under the influence (you can read more about it on the page if you want) without really taking himself too seriously, but I think that it has potential... but I might be biased. Some honest feedback would be appreciated.

Going into it though, you're going to hear a pretty rough, spontaneous recording - I think it may have even been done on a mobile phone. But it's taken a lot of encouragement to get him to post it, so if you guys think he has potential and can give him some more encouragement, I'm hoping to get some better quality recordings out of him!

First post here by the way. I'm looking forward to upvoting some new bands, especially anyone from Western Australia?"	t5_2rzhy	True

I come from a 70s punk / Detroit garage influenced background while the rest of the guys are more into hardrock a la Turbonegro and straight up heavy metal. We just finished recording and I'd love to hear what you think about our tunes! We'd love to hear from music writers, labels, and hot girls.  

Oh and on our myspace there's a video where a random girl kisses me during a song at at 00:58. That rocked!
