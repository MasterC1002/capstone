My hope was that it could make Korean music more accessible to people who are interested in the genre, but don't know where to start or what to look for. Secondarily, a place for fans to find new artists they aren't aware of in the link-dump pages.

I intend to keep working on it long-term, adding more links and information, so I welcome any recommendations for music or otherwise. 

It's not very slick or anything. Brutal honesty is encouraged. Please let me know what you think!

1343621452.0	xdiix	[Hwayoung Watch 2012] Hwayoung is leaving T-ARA	belongstomin	231	29	313	"All I have right now is this [tweet](https://twitter.com/allkpop/status/229789626565529601) from Allkpop 

EDIT 1: 
Here is Allkpop's [article](http://www.allkpop.com/2012/07/breaking-ccm-announces-hwayoung-will-leave-t-ara). 
Exerpt from the article:
&gt; “In deference to the complaints by T-ara’s staff of 19 people (5 stylists, 7 hair &amp; makeup, 5 on-site managers, 2 team mangers), Hwayoung’s contract as an artist will be voided effective immediately with no conditions.”

EDIT 2:
Here is Soompi's [article](http://www.soompi.com/2012/07/30/t-aras-hwayoung-gets-the-boot-contract-extinguished/)
This is what Kim Kwang Soo has to say:
&gt; “I would like to repeat that the T-ara’s bully theories are not true,” “Because I consider teamwork more important than each individual member of T-ara I have decided to respect the opinion of the 19 staff members. I decided to make this decision after thinking that there should be no staff members that are having a hard time anymore,” and “I thought for a long time if this was the right decision, although I know it hurts as much as your skin being pierced I made this decision for T-ara’s future and continued existence. With the staff members I have helped the T-ara members come to an understanding all-night until 7am this morning.”

EDIT 3:
Hwayoung just tweeted [this](https://twitter.com/rhy422/status/229797921611210752) which translates to, ""Facts are not true.""
[pic](http://i.imgur.com/69G8c.jpg) (thanks brb214)

EDIT 4:
Here is Koreaboo's [article](http://www.koreaboo.com/index.html/_/general/core-contents-media-announces-hwayoung-r16773) on this.

EDIT 5: 
[CCM's CEO Kim Kwang Soo's twitter](https://twitter.com/bosskwangsoo)
He is posting up the details of Hwayoung's departure in English.
**apparently it is a fake twitter??**

EDIT 6: Hwayoung's twin sister (and member of 5dolls), Hyoyoung tweets a [response](https://twitter.com/Rhy93/status/229794885362933760) (kind of..) [pic](http://i.imgur.com/PZFTf.png)

EDIT 7: Soomi (who was rumoured to be bullied out of 5dolls) tweets to Hwayoung, [here](https://twitter.com/leesumi00/status/229806313956339713)
Tweet just translates to, ""Hwayoung ah.."" (thanks sykoex)
also good to note that Eunkyo (who was rumoured to have bullied Soomi) also [tweets](https://twitter.com/qwer1347/status/229807297227026432) to Hwayoung saying, ""it's not fair.""

EDIT 8: Full press release [article](http://www.allkpop.com/2012/07/full-press-release-from-core-contents-media-regarding-hwayoungs-departure-from-t-ara) from Allkpop.

EDIT 9: Similar to Allkpop's article, this is a [fuller translation](http://jennyjjong.tumblr.com/post/28316309925/t-aras-big-announcement-full) (thanks mushuchan)

EDIT 10: Random note. T-ara's fancount has dropped ~5,000 on their fancafe. [link](http://houseofhappyendings.tumblr.com/post/28319987088/t-ara-fan-cafe-number-before-and-after-hwayoung) Although the first figure is taken from May, but this gives you a slight look at how fans are taking this..

EDIT 11: Allkpop just posted up a new article. [A Kim Kwang Soo interview](http://www.allkpop.com/2012/07/ccms-ceo-kim-kwang-soo-interviewed-regarding-hwayoungs-departure)
&gt;""I hope this issue is not inflated any further, (Hwayoung) I hope you stay quiet.""

&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

EDIT 12: [Another article by Allkpop](http://www.allkpop.com/2012/07/ccm-reveals-the-dark-side-of-hwayoung-mudslinging-ensues). This one allegedly showing the dark side of Hwayoung. Supposedly she refused to perform at MuBank last minute causing Eunjung and Hyomin having to take over her lines, which caused the mishap of Hyomin needing cue cards to read the lyrics.

*EDIT 12.5*: Here is a [naver article](http://news.naver.com/main/ranking/read.nhn?mid=etc&amp;sid1=111&amp;rankingType=popular_day&amp;oid=404&amp;aid=0000009897&amp;date=20120730&amp;type=1&amp;rankingSeq=3&amp;rankingSectionId=106) which describes the music bank incident like the one in edit 12. [Hwayoung was indeed at last week's MuBank](http://i.minus.com/iVkf383ZGO7oo.jpg). (thanks skatm092)

EDIT 13: [Tweet from a Japanese T-ara staff](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/ija01a) saying that Hwayoung did not talk to anyone, she was always calm and smiled at the staff and left a good impression. (thanks thefarrahmonster &amp; brb214)
This is quite a mess.

EDIT 14: From a different [reddit post](http://redd.it/xdono) Kyary Pamyu (popular artist in Japan, PON PON PON!) is on Hwayoung's side. (thanks EaglesOnPogoSticks &amp; boweruk)

*EDIT 14.5*: eng trans for her tweets avaliable here [1,](https://twitter.com/kyaryeng/status/229971470355398657)[2,](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/ijif5h)[3](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/ijicfp)

EDIT 15: T-ara's August comeback will continue as planned. [link](http://www.allkpop.com/2012/07/t-ara-to-proceed-with-their-august-comeback-as-scheduled) Which makes me wonder if Hwayoung's parts in 'Sexy Love' be replaced or was this the main plan all along &amp; that she isn't even in that song at all...

EDIT 16: This is a [blog post](http://m.pann.nate.com/talk/pann/313412698) ([pic](http://nimg.nate.com/orgImg/hi/2012/07/30/2012073016192942_1_rstarssw.jpg)) she supposedly made in November 6, 2011 that talks about her being bullied. [unconfirmed] ([allkpop's article on this w/ eng trans](http://www.allkpop.com/2012/07/netizens-dig-up-evidence-of-hwayoung-being-bullied))(thanks smarii &amp; sykoex)

[unconfirmed] [Eunjung's apology.](http://oniontaker.com/post/28328355082/eunjung-apology#axzz21zWUWI5J) However the screencap may be fake, also the date on it says July 28.

[Article](http://www.dkpopnews.net/2012/07/possibility-of-hwayoung-to-re-join-t-ara.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter) by dkpopnews.net says:
&gt;On the 30th, Kim Kwangsoo said to Star News, ""If Hwayoung truly realizes her wrongs, it's possible to talk with the T-ara members and staff about her rejoining. Once again, this is if Hwayoung looks over her previous actions and self-reflects so she does not repeat the same behavior."" (thanks BabyYourDoll)

SBS PD sides with Hwayoung, states that he will no longer cast T-ara. [Sources: [1](http://www.allkpop.com/2012/07/sbs-pd-states-he-will-no-longer-cast-t-ara-t-ara-concert-may-flop) [2](http://enewsworld.mnet.com/enews/contents.asp?idx=11129)] (thanks BabyYourDoll)
**update: PD apologizes for tweet [here](http://www.allkpop.com/2012/07/sbs-pd-ryu-chul-min-apologizes-for-his-tweet-regarding-hwayoung-t-ara)**

[Cliff Notes article on this whole controversy by allkpop](http://www.allkpop.com/2012/07/t-ara-controversy-cliff-notes-edition)

Eunjung's drama, Five Fingers will continue with Eunjung. [Source](http://www.allkpop.com/2012/07/five-fingers-to-proceed-with-t-aras-eunjung-still-a-member-of-the-cast)

EDIT 17: Former backup dancer of T-ara claims that Jiyeon once slapped Hwayoung across the face during a dance rehearsal. [read it here](http://www.allkpop.com/2012/07/t-aras-former-back-up-dancer-claims-jiyeon-once-slapped-hwayoung) **update: T-ara's dance team captain has responded to this claim and says that this incident is completely false. Sources: [1](http://redd.it/xf7vf) (thanks minifriedrice),[2](http://www.soompi.com/2012/07/31/alleged-t-ara-back-dancer-statement-points-to-hazing-ccm-denies/) (thanks Xeqa)**

EDIT 18: ~~Kim Kwang Soo~~ **An industry insider** now states that it was Hwayoung is to blame for Jiyeon's bad attitude incident back in 2010. Apparently Hwayoung was throwing a fit which led to Jiyeon's sour attitude. [article](http://www.allkpop.com/2012/07/t-aras-hwayoung-was-responsible-for-jiyeons-bad-attitude) &amp; [this performance](http://youtu.be/dP1jsrNO_C4)  (thanks lolipopp &amp; Xeqa)

EDIT 19: An online cafe named T-Jinyo (We Demand the Truth from T-ara) has gained over 160,000 members overnight. I'm seriously hoping this doesn't turn into another Tablo fiasco. 

EDIT 20: Another article summarizing the whole Hwayoung incident [here](http://kpopsurf.com/t-ara-hwayoung-controversy/) (thanks kpopsurf)

EDIT 21: There is now a petition going around for T-ara's disbandment. Currently has ~68k signatures, with a goal of 100,000. [petition](http://bbs3.agora.media.daum.net/gaia/do/petition/read?bbsId=P001&amp;articleId=124880&amp;objCate1=1#commentFrame#commentFrame#commentFrame) &amp; [article](http://www.soompi.com/2012/07/30/a-petition-for-t-aras-disbandment-has-started-online/)

EDIT 22: Kim Kwang Soo has met with Hwayoung/Hyoyoung's parents, claims that they are understanding of this situation. He ask that ""all articles in relation to T-ara be confirmed through our company before they are released on the internet"" Sources: [1](http://www.allkpop.com/2012/07/ceo-kim-kwang-soo-meets-with-the-parents-of-hwayoung-and-hyoyoung)

EDIT 23: Article about ""E.Via and Shin Hyun Joon express their feelings on bullying and ‘T-Jinyo’"".
[source](http://www.allkpop.com/2012/07/e-via-and-shin-hyun-joon-express-their-feelings-on-bullying-and-t-jinyo) (thanks Xeqa)
&gt;rapper E.Via has stepped up to criticize the “witch-hunting” by the group, as well as express her own feelings about bullying and ostracism.
Actor Shin Hyun Joon also spoke on the issue of bullying as he wrote, “Bullying.. is a cowardly, faceless killer. If you hurt someone, you’ll be hurt even more later on. Why don’t people realize what a joyous event it is when those around you come across success..”

Started 4 years ago ""areia remix"" is a k-pop remix/remake brand that with the help of our 27,000 fans became the most popular of its kind. After 120+ releases ""areia remix"" now includes a workforce of almost every Youtube k-pop remixer under the production guidance of Jun Areia. Moreover the brand caught the attention of several entertainment companies giving us the chance to boost the brand with official remixes like last year's ""Love Is Energy"" and ""Hypnotize"". With many more official remixes in the works and income coming in ""areia remix"", what was some Youtuber's fan-work was transformed into an actual paid job for a whole team. Except ""areia remix"" the production team has worked on original k-pop songs such as Andamiro's Waiting.

That incredible fan response and external investment from people that believed in what we are doing, gave us the courage and opportunity to attempt something that a few years ago would be a silly dream: since last May areiacreations is officially a label/entertainment company and we are preparing to debut our first two artists in early 2014! Unlike most traditional business models it's the fan support that made any of these possible so we would love to engage with you, answer your questions, chat about your thoughts and listen to your suggestions!

1.  I wasn't sure if it was really necessary and 

2. I'm sure it will just get down voted into non-existence. 

I've come to the conclusion that it is VERY necessary and I don't care how many down votes I get.

[/r/kpop](/r/kpop) has become the SNSD subreddit. Now, There is nothing wrong with liking SNSD. Hell, I'm a huge fan. Who doesn't like catchy songs sung by extremely attractive woman? (Well maybe hipsters...)  

I don't mind when a new SNSD song (or any group for that matter) is coming out and the front page is flooded with MV, Songs, performances and the like. 

What I take issue with is post like ""Sunny cut her hair!"" or ""Jessica the sleeping beauty!"" or todays top post ""Hyoyeon"". If you want to Karma whore for pictures, or you just can't help but scream from the rooftops how beautiful your favorite member of SNSD is, [GO TO THE SNDS SUBREDDIT.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ggggbabybabybaby) 

It's ridiculous that out of the top 25 posts for this month, almost 75% are post relating to SNSD. Out of the top 15 links today 11 are SNSD related. That is crazy. The second highest post of all time is a picture of Sunny. It's driving me insane, and I love Sunny, she's my favorite member. 

I come to [/r/kpop](/r/kpop) to get away from the pointless drivel of Allkpop and the circle jerks of the fan forums. I can appreciate a good circle jerk, who can't, but lets not turn [/r/kpop](/r/kpop) into one. 

IF you have a MV, a song, a performance, or some interesting information that is not generally known, post that. But, please, try to keep the circle jerk crap in it's place. 

Anyway, I'm sure this will be downvoted by all the sones who are not ready to hear a different point of view, but I'm hoping the more reasonable ones will take what I say to heart.

Thanks for listening.

Sincerely,
       Ironyfree

EDIT 1: It is not my intention for this post to become the catalyst for a whole new set of rules on r/kpop. I do not wish for pics or gifs to be banned. I am simply hoping that people realize that posting pics and gifs is not really what this subreddit is for. If you like a group a ton and you want to post pictures and talk about their clothing and hairstyles, do it on their fan forums. I don't think that anything SNSD related should be posted in SNSD (though you certainly can cross post), but that we should keep the frivolous things to an absolute minimum.  

In my opinion, and this is simply MY opinion, this subreddit should be for things that we can't find on the mainstream sites and for discussions of things that are big news. 

I would hate to have anyone leave the subreddit because they feel that they are unwanted, and I don't want the Mods to starts cutting posts. I just want us all to really think about why we have this subreddit and what content will make it better. Then just vote and post accordingly. 

Lastly, this isn't about SNDS. SNDS is just popular enough, and the timing is right, to create this problem. I feel the same way about any similar posts, be it Kara, Big Bang, T-ara or any one else. "	t5_2r1ox	True

Lately this subreddit has seen a decrease in quality content and the rise of selfposts which do little to promote discourse and thoughtful discussion. Not only do these posts fill the frontpage with simple questions can easily be answered, but they also provide little substance for our subscribers to work with in terms of engaging in meaningful conversation.

Some of these posts have had little to no relevance to the Korean pop industry, and while these posts barely qualify as submissions based on our rules, they have their place in the [Friday Free-for-All threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/search?q=friday+free-for-all&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on). Other posts are simply frivolous speculation, highly subjective, questions which have been asked numerous times before and can be answered with a search query. The kpop network of subreddits has grown steadily over the past year, and it provides us with another outlet (in addition to IRC and Friday FFA) for these kinds of posts.

I know that others who visit this subreddit share the same sentiments expressed in this post, and before we take action, we’d like to hear your thoughts and opinions on how to go about solving this problem.

To combat these issues, we’ve come up with some solutions which we’d like some feedback on:

* Possible addition of a weekly or biweekly General Discussion and Q&amp;A/help thread (Q&amp;A may be a separate thread from discussion)
* Possible addition of a weekly recommendations thread (if you/I like *x*, you/I might like *y*)
* Possible addition of a “What’s In Your Playlist” (or similarly styled) thread

We are aware that there are many new users who may have not yet familiarized themselves with our submission history and rules. While we are a kpop community, we believe the quality of our discussion can exceed the level of quality typically found on fandoms or blogs—let’s try to keep the primary focus on the music rather than the idols or musicians.

We are grateful for those who spoke out on this topic, whether it was through pure frustration and spite or through reasonable criticism. Know that this issue has been identified by many subscribers of the subreddit in addition to the /r/kpop moderators. **This is change that the community hopes to see.**

As always, thank you for listening.

1360054533.0	17xb05	As promised! My current collection of kpop ringtones I have made. Download/request inside!	Imcyberpunk	165	20	56	"Hey fellow K-poppers! 

Sorry for the delay, I originally said I'd get these up after New Year's but its been crazy busy at work and stuff... Anyway!

I have around 270 kpop ringtones and texttones (I change my tones all the time ha) that I have made. 

It is mostly girl groups, but there are some guy groups in there. I broke it into 2 sections:

* texttones (short audio clips 1-6 seconds long) 

* ringtones (longer audio clips 12-28 seconds)

I also used the following format to keep it easy to navigate: Artist - Song - Section of song/member singing - RT or TT (depending on which it is)


As I said before, I will take some requests! 

If anyone has requests, please provide the following:

* artist - song

* ring tone or text tone (or approx time duration wanted)

* any specific section of the song? (ex: ""the part at :33 where SooYoung says 'ayo GG!'"" or ""the first line of Gain- Bloom and the beat right up to before the second line"")

* phone operating system and/or file format. I know Android and Blackberry use mp3, iPhone uses m4a/m4r. 


I'll admit, the past 2 months or so, I haven't been keeping up with most of the latest song releases, so if there is one you want and don't see, just ask! 

*** iPhone users! all my ringtones are in mp3 (as I have an Android phone). I *can* convert them into m4a/m4r format if you need, but you can also use [Any Audio Converter (free program)](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEUQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.any-audio-converter.com%2F&amp;ei=zccQUe76EIbQygH7kIDgCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEFfb_XpY0reagT2qfSVaJNEvHqXQ&amp;bvm=bv.41867550,d.aWc) to convert it yourself.

* What's their fan club called?
* Any fandom in-jokes?
* Tell me a bit about the members
* Any good variety shows/diary shows/interviews/videos/behind-the-scenes/dance rehearsals etc.?

Well-known groups (even *really* well-known ones), rookies, groups who aren't around any more, whatever. This could also be a chance to share some groups who you feel are under-appreciated. Feel free to request groups you want to know more about, too.

So I just wanted to say something in case there are.  This applies to anyone, from the greenest rookies to the veterans, and to either gender.  

I think I can speak for the community when I say that we know how unbelievably hard you all work and what you have given up for your craft.  You have sacrificed any semblance of a normal life-relationships, seeing your loved ones, doing what you want, eating what you want, saying what you want, even being what you want-to entertain us.  All I want to say is that we here at /r/Kpop (and all of the related subs) genuinely appreciate this.  You have provided us with countless hours of great entertainment and much happiness with your music and performances and your appearances on television shows and specials, and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. 

To the community- I am not doing this for karma (it's a self-post) or in hopes for a response (although that would be wonderful) or anything like that.  It's just that outside of the minuscule chance of actually getting to talk to one of these people someday there really isn't any other good way to express these sentiments directly to them.  I figured it was worth a shot.  Also, you are all awesome!  But you already knew that.  "	t5_2r1ox	True
1354929720.0	14h5e3	GDragon says to expect solo albums from every member of Big Bang in 2013	balmaniac	137	15	29	"[Press conference in HK (121207)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9yC5Al8i1Q&amp;feature=player_embedded)

**Seungri**: Hello, we are Big Bang!

**MC**: I know this month is Seungri’s birthday. Happy birthday! How would you be celebrating it?

**Seungri**: Everyone knows that my birthday is coming, actually there has been many friends, teammates, colleagues starting to celebrate for me. I feel their love for me, and I feel very blessed. But actually we still have many undone performances, on my birthday we probably have to complete many live performances. It is also possible that on the actual day of my birthday I’m spending it on the plane. But I don’t mind this, because I know that many fans will still love me. I am very thankful! At the same time I will reciprocate everyone with better stage(s)!

**MC**: There’s a reporter who asked G-Dragon about him constantly appearing with different hair colours, so actually (s)he wants to ask you how do you take care of your hair? What are the special treatment that you will do to prevent hair fall? 

**GD**: Actually I don’t do anything much to take care of my hair. Because I want to always present myself to everyone in different hair colours. There isn’t any worry now, but..future..I don’t know.. (reporters laugh)

**MC**: Will there be any solo plans for every Big Bang member next year?

**GD**: From now on, probably next year, every member subsequently will have a chance to produce solo album. Actually everyone now has already started composing songs and lyrics etc. Whether it’s me, Taeyang, Daesung, Seungri, TOP, every member will have a chance. Everyone will see it next year.

---

To those who don't listen to Korean hip hop, I suggest that you at least try some of the links I list below. If you're asking for justification, I have a lot of reasons for bumpin' it as frequently as I bump American hip hop. 

I'll provide you with the main reasons.

The flow employed by these rappers are all pretty unique (feel free to correct me otherwise) and pleasant to the ear. The ""rhyming rifle"" technique in their flow, characterized by the unrelenting punches of internal as well as external rhymes, keeps me hooked. Not only that, but the scene prides itself in the massive availability of relatable lyrics for the average person. Sure, there are still songs dedicated to those who grew up in the slums, but more popular than those are lyrics dedicated for the average listener. Corporate workers, students, and fellow rappers alike. Don't get me wrong, there are still dope hype songs, but the Korean scene seems to manifest mainly in insightful topics, which is what I love personally.

Anyways, I present to you the most influential artists in the hip hop scene in Korea as of late. Instead of providing you with specifics on each artist, however, I'll provide links to songs I believe will most heavily influence your first impression of the rapper/group.. and so we begin:

---
**I've provided English subtitles to all of the following songs, so you can understand the lyrics!**

-------

&gt;***Epik High*** (Consists of members Tablo, Mithra, and DJ Tukutz): 

Let's introduce these guys with a funny-ass English freestyle: 

[Drunken freestyle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoiEHAHXFHI) - These two are Tablo and MYK. (MYK is considered an honorary member of Epik High)

and a parody of The Office: [The Office: Map the Soul: Episode 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRaghpPNHZQ)

Now onto the music..

1. [Rocksteady (English Vers.) feat. Kero One, Dumbfoundead, Rakka](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7NVPurpubs) - This song turned me onto Korean hip hop a few years ago. Features real dope MCs, including Rakka of the Dialated Peoples (who is the only non-Korean on the track, mind you)

2. [Day of Peace](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhPC2dqTHdU) - I really like to just vibe to this song to bring up my mood.

2. [Umbrella feat. Younha](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIvORsUx0z0) - For those rainy nights.

3. [Maze feat. Dumbfoundead, MYK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-k3_zfXlH8) - Dope flows and dope lyrics.

4. [Over](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKiGy2A_nU) - Some may relate to this..

5. [Mr. Doctor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgstjf5hmgU) - Be on the edge of your seat for the sick English verse.

Side note: Tablo is a proficient English speaker. He graduated from Stanford University with an English major, and continues to pump some dope English lyrics here and there. Also, Dumbfoundead, Kero One, and MYK are Korean rappers as well, though their target audience is mainly American.

------

&gt;***Primary*** (Producer):

Been bumpin' to this guy's EP a lot lately (Primary and the Messengers EP). Really, the music this guy makes is for anyone.

1. [?(모름표) feat. Dynamic Duo, Choiza](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUVUZL4Gmws) - The title translates to Question Mark.

2. [만나 feat. ZION.T](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBC55La8SLQ) - Translates to Let's Meet.

3. [Right There feat. Dynamic Duo, E-Sens, Boi B](http://youtu.be/1sOKWrCCA-c) - Crazy hypeass song! Sorry I couldn't find a translated version to this.

Side Note: This cat thrives on features for his music, being a producer, but still holds his own.
 
----
&gt;***Drunken Tiger aka Tiger JK***:

I'd recommend this dude to more old school cats.

This song isn't really my style, but I wanted to mention it because I think it's pretty mainstream and there are Korean denizens who want to push it into the American charts: [Get It In (English Vers.) feat. Tasha Reid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLVkzL0fLXE)

The songs below are much more typical of Tiger's music.

1. [Monster (English Vers.) feat. Rakka, Roscoe Umali, T, Rakim](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFNx5M_eOto) - Yep, you read right. That's Rakim of Eric. B &amp; Rakim. The majority of this track's rappers are indeed non-Korean!

2. [8:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHxnPSWZXMg) - Soulful as hell.

3. [Because I'm a Man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_3QTqBmUic) - Popular song by him years ago. Can't say anything about it myself.


Side Note: Tiger JK is known as the one who most prominently entered South Korea into the relevance of hip hop. His wife, Yoon Mi-Rae, is also a rapper known as Tasha Reid, or T.

-----

&gt;***MC Sniper &amp; MC Outsider*** (Outsider is known as one of the fastest rappers alive):

Just to show you the speed of Outsider's spits, and its legitimacy: [Like a Man (Live)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWYi3PvUFY) - Just wait for it.

I listen to these guys for flow.

1. [One Way](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__ngaU-uhJQ)

2. [Better Than Yesterday feat. Outsider, Room9, Zenio7, TakTak36, DJ R2, BK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H59z3eixoeE) - Gotta love the Rocky sample 

3. [Face Off](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw3gO2VS74I) - Sorry, couldn't find English translations for this one.

4. [City Hunter (Outsider feat. Basick, Carry D.)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5on_7jyVbo) - Again, another one untranslated. My apologies!

Side note: I put these independent artists together because I think they complement each other very well, with a fast spitting flow matched with one with a sort of off-cadence. MC Outsider is MC Sniper's protege, and they rep the same label.

----

&gt;***Dynamic Duo*** (Consists of members Gaeko and Choiza)

These dudes make a lot of smooth, soulful songs that appeal to the mainstream, but still retain meaningful lyrics. Again, for anyone to listen to and enjoy.

1. [죽일 놈](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRYkLg-TWC0) - Translates to Bastard.

2. [거기서거기](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk0b41kh2yg) - Translates to Without You. Sorry for the music video's interruptions, but that was the only translated version I could find!

3. [Solo (feat. Alex of Clazziquai)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjOX1o0Zkkk)

4. [Loves Gonna Getcha by Dumbfoundead](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvIvSHnyZIA) -Smooth as hell.

----

&gt;***Supreme Team*** (Consists of members Simon Dominic and E-Sens)

1. [I'm No Good (E-Sens feat. Simon D., Minos)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITUm7pq7aHo) - Hittin' a classic Amy Winehouse instrumental. Another one without translation, but the flow is tight.

2. [Cheers (Simon D. Solo)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy94tB5MldE) - A smooth drinking song. One of my favorites! I apologize for the absence of ass in this music video. 

3. [Then, Then, Then feat. Brown Eyed Soul](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evn7MgjuTss)

Side Note: Yes, these dudes are a bit more mainstream. If you're not about that, fine. But if you jump to conclusions and think they're not about lyricism, you gotta read the translations!

-----

After you've (hopefully) been through all of these songs, here's how I rank these artists:

1. Epik High
2. Dynamic Duo
3. Primary
4. Supreme Team
5. MC Sniper &amp; MC Outsider
6. Tiger JK

To each his own, though.

All information is completely anonymous, so don't worry about your responses being associated with your IP/name or anything.

The survey can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGJ0VmN2Y3MzZkwwRXlBZmtNS1N0QWc6MQ). Let me know if you have any questions! I'll post the results in a few days once this has accumulated enough responses.

Also, thanks to everyone on IRC who gave me suggestions for the survey / helped me edit the questions :)

Edit: Things to address:

- Sorry that there's no Northern Europe / Scandanavia option for region! Put it under 'other' and I'll go back and count up those responses.

- I also forgot to include US territories such as Hawaii in my regions. Apologies &gt;&lt;

- I also neglected to include New Zealand as a separate region from Australia... I'm not sure whether people have been picking Australia anyways or typing in New Zealand in 'other' for region if they reside there, but do whatever you wish.

- For some reason, I missed f(x) and G.NA on the artist list. Type them into 'other' if you want to select them - I was going to go back and check the other responses anyways.

- I added an 'other' option for gender for those of us who are genderqueer/do not fit the gender binary. My sincere apologies for not including this option from the start. I think next year I will also include a question on whether one is cis/trans* just so we can get some more thorough stats."	t5_2r1ox	True

A friend of mine noticed that the English translation of Gangnam Style [found here](http://www.kpoplyrics.net/psy-gangnam-style-lyrics-english-romanized.html) has a few inaccuracies, though (some major, some minor), so he made an attempt to correct it.

Here's a revised one with some notes:

&gt;Oppa's Gangnam style^1  
Gangnam style  

&gt;A girl who is warm and human by day^2  
A classy girl who knows how to relax with a cup of coffee  
A girl whose heart heats up by night  
A girl with that kind of twist  

&gt;I'm a guy  
A guy who is as warm as you by day  
A guy who one-shots his coffee before it even cools down  
A guy whose heart bursts by night  
That kind of guy  

&gt;Beautiful, lovely  
Yeah you, hey, yeah exactly you, hey  
Beautiful, lovely  
Yeah you, hey, yeah exactly you, hey  
Shall we take it to the limit?  

&gt;Oppa's Gangnam style, Gangnam style  
Oppa's Gangnam style, Gangnam style  
Oppa's Gangnam style  

&gt;Heyyy sexy lady, Oppa's Gangnam style  
Heyyy sexy lady oh oh oh oh  

&gt;A girl who looks quiet but who gets down when she gets down  
A girl who lets her hair loose when she feels it's the right time  
A girl who keeps covered but is sexier than girls who expose it all  
A sensual^3 girl like that  

&gt;I’m a guy  
A guy who seems calm but who gets down when he gets down  
A guy who goes completely crazy when it's the right time  
A guy whose ideas bulge bigger than his muscles  
That kind of guy  

&gt;Beautiful, lovely  
Yeah you, hey, yeah exactly you, hey  
Beautiful, lovely  
Yeah you, hey, yeah exactly you, hey  
Shall we take it to the limit?  

&gt;Oppa's Gangnam style, Gangnam style  
Oppa's Gangnam style, Gangnam style  
Oppa's Gangnam style  

&gt;Heyyy sexy lady, Oppa's Gangnam style  
Heyyy sexy lady oh oh oh oh  

&gt;Above the man that runs, is the man that flies^4 , baby baby  
I’m a guy who knows a thing or two  
Above the man that runs, is the man that flies, baby baby  
I’m a guy who knows a thing or two  

&gt;You know what I'm sayin'  
Oppa's Gangnam style  

&gt;Heyyy sexy lady, Oppa's Gangnam style  
Heyyy sexy lady oh oh oh oh*

**Notes:**

1. Contraction of ""Oppa IS Gangnam style"" (NOT ""the Gangnam style that belongs to Oppa""). Put as a contraction for accuracy. It's shortened in the Korean.
2. When words like ""warm"" and ""human"" are used (the literal translations) they hold similar metaphorical meanings in Korean as they do in English - friendly, approachable, natural, and so on.
3. NOT ""sensible."" There is a huge difference!
4. Literal translation. This is a proverb equivalent to ""every man has his superior."" PSY's saying that his talent is a tier above everyone else; he's in a different league. ""Run"" can also be replaced with ""jump"" - the intended meaning is the same.

http://youtu.be/EJq-VqaM5j8 - super junior singing '[ai se eu te pego](http://youtu.be/hcm55lU9knw)'

About the show: I'm not a super junior fan (i know 2~3 songs at most) but my girlfriend is a huge fan.

The show itself is quite good, better than i imagined:

* they interact a lot with the fans (one of them actually gave an autograph during the show)
* the songs are catchy, even the slower ones
* holy shit they dance really well
* it's quite long (3ish hours) show and they have tons of videos - from almost-movie-like secret agent scenes to a parody of the avengers
* they didn't have the same structure as they have in korea since it was a smaller venue, but there were a lot of light effects, bubbles, shredded paper.
* their (brazilian) fans are loud. i mean, really really loud. i don't think i ever heard so many girls screaming/crying/screaming at the same time.

* apparently some korean tv was there for the show – lots of cameras, korean guys taking pictures of the fans waiting for the show, people being interviewed.
* the show was absolutely crowded – it was sold out in less than a week.
* and last - i saw people singing all of their song, probably in broken korean since i don't speak it. and the super junior guys heard and commented about it at the end of the show.

EDIT 3: [this](http://oniontaker.com/post/28323050539/t-ara-what-just-happened#ixzz22ACc0GRY) article draws a few conclusions, and I agree it is a good read. KKS could potentially be having Hwayoung take the bullet for all the damaging information T-ara is facing. (thanks 084806)

&gt; Sharp broke up because of the group’s disharmony. It’s hard for me to talk about T-ara when one member has left.” She continued, “(The stories) may be true or not, but I think all are victims and attackers in one. In addition to Hwayoung, all the members are really getting hurt.”

Another [article](http://www.soompi.com/2012/07/31/t-ara-losing-endorsement-deals-due-to-bully-controversy/) about how T-ara is losing endorsement deals.

&gt; “I just uploaded an apology post. I’m going to go apologize to the CEO right now. I feel really bad. He has been good to me...I don’t hold a grudge against him (CEO, Kim Kwang Soo). He treated me very well. I am just regretful of all the damage that is being done because of me. So I’m going to go apologize.”

Company officials are now sitting down with idol group members to talk about if they have been experiencing problems in the groups, some officials have been limiting the idols' SNS bans (*I think that may be internet use?

IMPORTANT: Since there are soo many entries, Ive decided to give out another CD as well. It will be Sistars Loving U Summer Love album. Its the repackaged Alone Mini Album. It will not include the poster though.

~~Okay, So I bought an extra random copy of their 4th album. I got it when it was on Yesasia and they only had the Random edition ones. A few days later I found the individual Albums with each member on them so I bought all 9. So I have an extra one coming.~~

~~Since Ill have all 9 already, I mine as well make someone happy and give it to them. All you guys have to do is post a comment below and ill put the names into a RNG calculator when the CD gets here.~~

~~Please do not post more than once, I will make another post to put the winner in. I will pay shipping to the person who wins.~~
Good luck and Have fun

EDIT: So this kinda got blown up really fast. I might have to dig around in my collection and find another thing to give away at this rate

EDIT 2: So if I get the group album cover, then the winner will be able to choose what Version of the album that they want. But if its a member cover then, that will be the CD given."	t5_2r1ox	True

So I raise the volume to max only to realize that my headphones sound weird..I look down at the headphone jack..and omo..they're not plugged in...
~""Lipstick stee tair ya go..ommah om maaah""~
....Fack. I wasn't sitting next to people at the time but there were certainly people around me and now theres this Asian guy walking around trying to find the source of the music with a smile on his face. 

So yeah..anyone else have a story?"	t5_2r1ox	True

Some things of note:

- 18-24 is the most common age range, matching the rest of reddit
- We have about the same male/female distribution as the rest of reddit
- We have more bisexual people than gay, which I thought was interesting
- Race is where we differ most from the rest of reddit - we have a very significant number of Asian members
- Region is a little messed up because I forgot to include an option for Northern Europe, New Zealand, and US Territories, hence the large number of responses in the 'other' category. We have a good number of Europeans, Canadians, and Australians!
- The relationship status stats are pretty depressing...


For the K-pop related questions:

- Much larger spread of artists than last year, but of course, SNSD is the clear majority with a surprising 27% of total responses
- A lot more people are voting for guy groups this year - BIGBANG has 8% of votes, SHINee 3%, etc.
- A ton of people were exposed to K-pop through e-sports (17%). Many responses to this category didn't fit the options that I had laid out, so definitely check out the spreadsheet to see how people discovered K-pop!
- Lots of longtime listeners (I'll include more year ranges next time)
- Lots of us know a little bit of Korean (likely picked up from variety shows and dramas and such)
- I'm surprised at the number of people that visit Allkpop and Soompi for news

1347906178.0	1018fe	[Guide] Kpop 101: How to Stay Up-to-Date with KPop Information	soshix21	119	18	22	"Hi /r/Kpop! ☺ I’ve been meaning to write something like this for a while, but never got around to it. However, I felt that it would be a great way to celebrate us reaching 10k members, so here it is! It’s a bit long, so I apologize ahead of time. 

I’ve gotten a few questions over the last few months about how exactly I stay on top of Kpop news and information. I’ve been a fan of Kpop since the 90s, and there never was a time before when information was so easily accessible, yet hard to quickly filter through junk and decipher news. The current sidebar of /r/Kpop has 6 links to how to start listening to Kpop (and recommendations to “starter songs""), but none to continue to find new content and stay on top of the burgeoning industry (outside of ""Useful Sites""). Finally, a lot of fans have gotten more secretive about the source of their material, so hopefully this will expand people’s horizons and quench their curiosity. Here’s my list of recommendations, in order of most important to least (the first 3 are the best):

* **Twitter**: There really isn’t a single website that is more influential and important to the spread of Kpop information than Twitter. Sources directly tweet and respond to thousands of people simultaneously. From here, you often hear the fastest news, most recent pictures, and leaks/spoilers to upcoming events/music of your favorite artists. The difficult thing about twitter is that there is no centralized Kpop representative—it’d be way too hard to follow every artist and every piece of news. Instead, there are major “Big Name Fans” in each fandom that corner their own market. It’s important to look for those in your particular interest and follow them if you would like. While I do not claim to know all fandoms, a few good ones off the top of my head are:

&gt;For SNSD: 
&gt;
&gt;* @Real_Chichinhu
&gt;* @ch0sshi
&gt;* @haljung
&gt;
&gt;For Big Bang:
&gt;
&gt;* @LueKim 
&gt;* @hood_bang

Beyond that, there are twitter accounts (examples) associated with almost all major fansites (@sosiznet), fanmade photo sites (@flying_petals), and actual artists (Dara’s new Twitter: @Krungy21). You can add whoever you want depending on your preferences. If redditors know more about their own groups, please share! I’d love to expand my Kpop list on Twitter.

* **Forums**: Sometimes Twitter is overwhelming. Some fans tweet all day, so news can be lost amidst personal and random information. Forums have always been a great place for K-pop fans to come together. It’s nice because it’s a more distilled form of information that doesn’t disappear if you don’t read it within a certain amount of hours. You can backtrack on your favorite artists after a long day of work or after being away for weeks. Moreover, hundreds—if not thousands—of fans try their best to quickly post new information to notify others. Thus, it helps bring together people of different fandoms and bias groups to post the pictures and news they find. Lastly, it helps fans communicate with each other—both Koreans and Non-Koreans. This is helpful because people vent their frustrations, express their happiness, and are able to read translations/subs of news articles/videos before they’re even released on Allkpop or other congregates (usually hours to days before).

After 6Theory, the major forum site last year associated with Allkpop, “disappeared,” the best forum site now is probabl. I was more willing to post this guide now because of two reasons: First, [posts like these](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/zyqee/a_proposition_to_the_mods_or_rkpop/) honestly sadden me. No fan should be left wondering what is happening with their favorite group because a major news site decides not to report on them while they’re “on hiatus.” Questions are meant to be asked, and discussions are always great. I would check out  with all the links to artist’s/idol’s threads. Find an artist you are interested, and just take a look around at the content and community. I guarantee that if you are a major fan of a group, you’ll love the threads for the sheer amount of camaraderie and similar enthusiasm. 

Post a 411 so the community can properly welcome you[ ), and Say “Hi” in artists threads you are interested in. Fellow fans and members will welcome you with open arms. If you jump in and start posting, you’ll see why forums are a great community for any Kpop fan!

* **Tumblr**: Tumblr is great for sharing new pictures, gifs, and fanmade edits. It hurts itself because there aren’t really that many that discuss Kpop. People like OnionTaker used it as a platform to start a community, but these types of situations are rare. For SNSD, there are some great ones like www.ggoh.tumblr.com who makes new content and answers questions. Find some reputable names in your fandoms. Furthermore, tumblr is great because it has a search tag function. If you replace the #### with a group name or idol you like, you can find all the recent posts tagged with it: www.tumblr.com/tagged/#### This is how I find the most recent gifs for people on Reddit when they ask during a comeback. Put “Secret” in there, and see all the most recent “Poison” gifs made by the community. Put “Hyosung,” and you’ll only find content related to her. Also, this  helps find tumblrs associated with your interested by seeing who submitted those posts.

* **News Aggregates**: There are good news aggregates and bad ones, depending on how they present the news and how nonbias they are. My favorite to visit is probably Koreaboo (by our very own /u/fiveSeven_). Koreaboo (like Soompi, AllKpop, etc) is a news aggregate with information from all areas of Korean Media (not only music). KB is very professional with their wording and timings, without losing their quality. The biggest issues with these sites are that they aren’t always up-to-date with information, sometimes even days to weeks behind when news is actually released, and can’t possibly cover all the information about all your favorite artists. They need to (understandably) choose what is appropriate and post the most important. 

* **Special Sites**: First, [Omona](http://omonatheydidnt.livejournal.com/) is a more unfiltered approach to Kpop news. They are a bit quicker and they don’t take themselves as seriously as the sites above. Second, [NetizenBuzz](http://netizenbuzz.blogspot.com/) is run to provide recent reactions from Korean Netizens by directly translating articles and comments. Not all the comments are worthwhile/rational, but they give a good glimpse into how Korea is reacting, instead of only reading international opinions on Reddit or Allkpop. Third, Reddit. We have our own /r/Kpop, which provides barebones news, past throwbacks to MVs/music, and have some discussion. It is generally the most mature Kpop environment I’ve found on the web, simply because it emulates the rest of Reddit/the type of members it attracts. However, because it’s user-driven it might be the sparsest for actual up-to-date information. Also, check out related reddits like /r/Korea and /r/koreanmusic. Lastly, [SeoulBeats](http://seoulbeats.com/) is a great site to read editorials and more lengthy discussions. While the quality has gone done over the years, it nevertheless is the best site for actual written content. I may not agree with everything posted, but they are valid opinions of someone else.

* **Korean Sites**: There are numerous Korean sites that help keep people informed. The obvious Newsen, OSEN, Naver, Daum, etc are good for those who can read and understand Korean, but not everyone can. Moreover, it is hard to translate all those articles and reactions no matter how hard we try. Other sites, like fanmade sites for photos (ShiningSmiles, Seople), often require a KSSN to gain access, but you try to e-mail/tweet them for permission. I can discuss this in another guide in the future.

* **Chatrooms**: Most major communities have a chatroom, but they are often hard to find. Some, for example, are: /r/Kpop has a chatroom (details on the right) and International Sones have a few (/r/snsd, Hallyu8’s ustream room via their Artist Thread, SSF’s Sbox). If someone else knows more, please let us know!

* **Major International Fansites**: I put this last because of how variable it is. Places like [BB World Wide](http://bigbangworldwide.blogspot.com/) do a GREAT job staying on top of breaking news and keeping the community close (I’m almost positive they were the first to report the Sungri scandal hours before anyone else picked up on it recently). Other sites, such as Soshified, have slowly gotten weaker because of the lack of new support. However, they do have a stable forum/gifting portion, and an assortment of past SNSD media/subs. This depends on your fandom and who runs it. Usually the bigger the group, the more fans; the more volunteers/staff, the better sites.


I purposely left out how to access K-Media (Video, Pictures, Subs, Torrents, etc) because I felt that this guide was already too long. I’ll try to write another one up in the future if this first guide is well received or people request it. If not, I can just leave this here for any newcomers, and keep it at that. I know most about SNSD these days, so if fans of other fandoms want to post twitters, tumblrs, chatrooms that would be awesome. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns via comments or PM."	t5_2r1ox	True

PutYaGunsOn	114	14	68	"Alright, so thanks to sort of an [on-the-spot collaboration between me and Ayailla](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1ccioq/what_characteristics_do_you_associate_with/c9fibo0), if that's the right thing to call it, I'm posting a drinking game.  Ayailla started it, and I pretty much just expanded on it.

Basically, pull up a K-pop video on YouTube and read the comments until you can't go on anymore.

**1.** Take a shot for every comment in which someone spams their favorite member's name.

For example,

""Eunhyuk &lt;3 Eunhyuk&lt;3 Eunhyuk &lt;3 Eunhyuk&lt;3 Eunhyuk &lt;3 Eunhyuk&lt;3 Eunhyuk &lt;3 Eunhyuk&lt;3 Eunhyuk &lt;3 Eunhyuk&lt;3 Eunhyuk &lt;3 Eunhyuk&lt;3 Eunhyuk &lt;3 Eunhyuk&lt;3 Eunhyuk &lt;3 Eunhyuk&lt;3 Eunhyuk &lt;3 Eunhyuk&lt;3 Eunhyuk &lt;3 Eunhyuk&lt;3 Eunhyuk &lt;3 Eunhyuk&lt;3 Eunhyuk &lt;3 Eunhyuk&lt;3""

or whatever.  Take two if it's in the Top Comments section.

**2.** Take a shot for every ""(name of group) fighting!""

**3.** Take a shot for every ""(name of completely different group) is so much better"".  Basically, if someone actually went out of their way to put down the group in the video and say that their favorite group is better.

**4.** Take a shot for every comment where someone calls them Chinese or Japanese.  Take another if someone calls the vid/group/song ""kawaii"".

**5.** Take a shot for every non-Korean comment that has a ""saranghae"" in it somewhere.

**6.** Take a shot for every ""(name of member) is my oppa/unnie &lt;3"".

**7.** Take two for every unholy combination of 5 and 6 (which usually take the form of ""Saranghae (name of member) oppa/unnie &lt;3"")

**8.** If watching a video of SHINee's Sherlock, take a shot for every reference to ""Soy un Dorito!""

**9.** Take a shot for every comment where someone asks if they said ""nigga"".

**10.** Take a shot for any reply to 9 that's like ""OMG NO THEY'RE SAYING NIGA/NAEGA WHICH MEANS YOU ARE/I AM OMG YOU'RE SOOOO IGNORANT""

**11.** Take a shot for every comment that tells you to like/increase views/vote by to get the song on the top of some random chart.

**12.** Take a shot for every comment thread showing two fandoms arguing.

**13.** ""OMFG (name(s) of member of another group(s)) IS IN THIS VIDEO"" - shot for each name mentioned.  Another shot for each one referred to as oppa/unnie.

**MINI GAME**
If you're gonna be clever and avoid getting drunk by using Gangnam Style as your K-pop video, play [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1ce3eb/youtube_kpop_drinking_game/c9g00cp) instead.

Have fun!

Oh, and [check out this drinking game too!](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1cgc91/kpop_mv_drinking_game/)

**STREAMING**

1. [KGP HD WORLD](http://www.justin.tv/kgp700) - probably will be the best looking stream, reliable and eng chat from korean streamer. (backup streams [kgp701](http://www.justin.tv/kgp701), [kgp703](http://www.justin.tv/kgp703) and [updates on twitter](https://twitter.com/kgp700))

2. [SNSDSUNKIST](http://www.justin.tv/snsdsunkist) - next most reliable stream and good quality from this chinese streamer.

3. [LIONS927](http://www.justin.tv/lions927) - another reliable streamer.

4. [KPOPSTREAMS](http://kpopstream.wix.com/streams#!gayo-daejun/c1mgo) - unsure how reliable these 10 streams will be.

*these are the streamers I've been able to confirm with so far, unsure of any official streams at this point.

*This post will continue to be updated as more info comes in. If anyone has more info (specifically line-ups and official streaming links) please post in comments or pm and I will update. Thanks everyone and looking forward to some great stages this year!*"	t5_2r1ox	True

(And no, I didn't starve myself after looking at pictures of SNSD.) The answer? Dancing. Pick your favorite most upbeat song on your kpop playlist, and literally just put all your energy into dancing to the beat of the music. I have lost so much weight by just doing this and not changing my diet at all *( I eat nutella more than I'd like to admit )* Something about convulsing your body like a madman to music just works. I usually do this for about 30 minutes, or like 8~ish songs. Time goes by much faster and you don't *feel* like you're working out. I've lost about 8 Lb since I've started doing this around the middle of April. 

Don't worry about looking stupid while doing it: you will. That's why I do it in my bedroom with the doors locked and blindes closed

Also, don't worry about learning the **actual** dance to the song, unless you want to, but I don't recommend it for losing weight, because usually dances are toned down so they can sing."	t5_2r1ox	True

1349846845.0	118lte	Just got an email confirmation for Pledis Audition...	Zodiacd	112	16	53	"Ok so first of all, here's the info.

&gt;Schedule:
Los Angeles: October 13th, 2012
San Francisco: October 14th, 2012

How to apply: Deadline is [October 9th, 2012]

E-mail: auditionusa@pledis.co.kr
[Send in your Profile (Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Nationality, School, Phone Number, Place of Audition)]

Applicants must be born in the years 1991 – 2003 and be Asian American.

------------------

With that said, that was the first information that was sent out. I instantly saw it and got excited until I saw...

**Applicants must be born in the years 1991 – 2003 and be Asian American.**

I was born in 1988 so I slightly lost hope...but I said you know what? Why not just give it a shot and send in the application?

I've gone through SM auditions and failed because I was nervous about auditioning. So I almost gave up until I saw the Pledis Audition news.

Here's a short story of me. I used to listen to old school kpop such as H.O.T, Shinhwa, Baby VOX, BoA and S.E.S. I stopped listening around 2002-2003. I recently got back into it just last summer. How? I was at anime expo and the hotel I was staying at was owned by a korean family. So they had 2 channels that was korean. There, I saw a music video of a girl group (which til this day I still don't know who it was) and liked the beat to it. So I said, once I go back home, I'm gonna search them up. Upon getting home a couple days later, I youtube Top 10 girl groups kpop. Searching and searching, I found plenty. But then with some clicking to the recommended videos, I saw

**After School - Because of you.**

I fell in love with this song. Everything about it was amazing. Rain, Piano, Violin, the sadness in their voices, their expression, the dance, the dark clothing...everything. I was obsessed with this song! And so it began, I got back into Kpop.

I became a fan of After School every since and without knowing much, I just wanted to support them and their company. Go into Son Dambi, NU'est, and now Hello Venus. I missed my chance at last year's audition but now this time, I had to give it a try.

So upon writing this email and submitting my application to Pledis Audition US, I added something else.

One in english, and one, I used a google translator and translated my paragraph to Hangeul.

Pretty much I said, I've grown up singing and listening to music all my life. Never once did I think I would want to do this until I saw After School - Because of you. Something just sparked and I wanted to be a kpop star like everyone else. But the thing was, I'm 24 and I was too old to be considered in their application. But this is my dream and I've gone to other auditions and didn't make it. I was just about to give up this dream until I saw Pledis Audition, who I've always wanted to go for. If Kahi became a singer under pledis at around 28-29, then give me a chance. There's nothing for Pledis to lose and everything for me to lose as this is my last chance to chase my dream. If I didn't make it, alright, that's fine, not everyone will make it at the audition. So pledis doesn't have to worry about it, but for me, I have to at least try one more time and this time it's the company I truly want to be apart of. So I asked them to just please for once, ignore my age and allow me to try.

And that was that.

Usually, auditions, they would send you a confirmation about the application and later email you a specific date for the audition. I didn't get one so I said, you know, maybe I am too old and thus they ignored my email. I simply just gave up and continued my daily life.

Until now.

I randomly check my email and I get a confirmation from Pledis.

-----------------------

&gt;Hello, This is PLEDIS CASTING TEAM.

We gladly inform that you passed the document screening of 2012 PLEDIS GLOBAL AUDITION.

So many people filled with passion and talents applied for 2012 PLEDIS GLOBAL AUDITION.
We are appreciating your interest in PLEDIS and intense applications.

Please find the date, time, and location of scene audition we're announcing and be sure to attend.
PLEDIS wishes you to pass the audition. Thank you. 

----------------------------------

Just today? I haven't even prepared for it and I have no cash at all. @.@ My audition is Sunday in San Fransisco at 10AM. Did they honestly give me a chance? Whatever, this is my last chance to chase my dreams. Tomorrow, I'm going to my bank and seeing if I can take out a small loan just for gas and other things to make my trip to there for this moment. If the bank doesn't allow, I'm selling as much as I can on craigslist. I'm going full throttle with practicing my singing. The song I will sing for my audition will be Hyun Bin - That man. My last chance to take ahold of my dream. Even if I don't have the looks, the body, the voice or anything, what matters, is I pursue my dreams and shoot for it. 

**Hwaiting!**

*QUICK EDIT:* Just so others would know, my name is Dan Cha. =D It was funny reading ""Zodiacd"" so I thought I just put my name out there and thank everyone who's showing their amazing support. I will definitely see this through and do my best. Thanks for all the encouragement guys.

**Quick Edit 2:** Has anyone else seen Dream High II? There's a scene where JYP's character tells Kahi's character that he doesn't think he can become a singer because he was too old. She then told him that you're never too old to chase your dream. In which later JYP goes for an audition. Although movies always makes it look easy, it's still comforting to hear what they said and the determination. One of the reasons why I'm going for this chance.

**Quick Edit 3:** I'm sorry everyone, I appreciate everyone's encouragement and support, but there are things that I can't control in life. Worst case scenario, I can't come up with enough money for gas and food for my trip since I had to help my family with this one traditional thing that's going on, on Saturday. Craigslist responded but it was just the typical scam. Even though today is Friday, I can't ask anyone else for money even though I know i'm gonna pay them back. Heh, now I wish I didn't leave my friends. If I had gotten the confirmation that they accepted my application a few weeks back, I would've been able to save money for this. Oh well, what's done is done. I'm happy Pledis Entertainment gave me a chance even though I was 24, and I'm honestly ready to go this Sunday and do my best to show that I want this. But with no money, there's no way I can make it to San Jose. *sigh* I'm disappointed but I just have to look forward and pursue something else that is much easier to attain. I'll always support Pledis Entertainment and their wonderful idols and future idols. Son Dambi, After School, NU'est, Hello Venus, Kahi, Bekha, and the up and comers. Really wish I could've been apart of that family. Whoever's going to the audition, I hope you accomplish your dreams and make it. Because I can't, I'm giving you my energy to help boost you a little and hope you can make it. Hwaiting!"	t5_2r1ox	True

1357609973.0	165nb9	[Scandal Summary] Block B vs Stardom Entertainment 	balmaniac	106	16	20	"Block B is “suing, or filing an injuction” against their company (Brand New Stardom Entertainment) because they have not been getting paid properly since April of ‘11. (their debut) They filed it on January 3rd, 2013 in Seoul.


Facts :
---------------------


* The CEO of Stardom (Mr.Lee) took about 70,000,000 won (approximately 66k USD) from the members parents and disappeared with it. His whereabouts are currently unknown. Authorities are looking for him.
* They are suing together as a group. This is suing against their company. They are all suing. They are all upset at BNS. They are not upset with each other. 
* Disbandment has not been spoken of, only terminating their contract with BNS if they do not pay them their due regularly and what they owe them and their parents.
* ~~The company (including CEO and Cho PD) have not spoken out on this.~~ [Block B and Brand New Stardom's official statements](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/15xd86/block_b_send_petition_to_part_ways_with_management/c7quoda) as of January 3rd, 2013. EvoL and Topp Dogg (trainee group) has remained silent about this so far. EvoL members have been on twitter, changing twitter display pictures and banners but not tweeting. 
* Park Kyung and Zico removed Block B from their twitter descriptions
* On December 31st, Kyung randomly informed fans that he changed his twitter from @blockbkyung to @kyungpark1992. People think this may have happened because he was ready for the switch
* They have not been properly paid since debut. After one member became fed up and tried to terminate his contract in March of 2012, BNS finally gave the members some money. They discovered that 10+ events in which profits were made were missing from BNS's calculations, and therefore missing from their paychecks.
* BNS still stands by their statement that they paid Block B fairly, while Block B claims that BNS is blatantly lying.
* BNS confirms and acknowledges the fact that their CEO stole money from Block B and their parents. They claim that Mr.Lee (CEO) swindled the members parents (as well as Brand New Stardom) on his own. He met with the parents on his own accord and extorted money from them without consulting the company at all. Police are now on the lookout for him, he will be criminally charged when found.
* BNS does not support Mr.Lee at this time. Mr.Lee's friend, a higher up in BNS who assisted in this crime, will be resigning and will be charged as well
* Block B believes that BNS did not work hard enough to get them onto music shows, reality shows, etc, after their comeback. Because of that, did not get much screentime to promote. As a group that is still fairly new, screentime is essential for the success of the group. They are unhappy because of this. 
* Brand New Stardom first found out that Block B was suing them by reading articles on the internet.
* Block B has been wanting to cancel their contract for a long time, and have finally decided to do so now as a last resort. They believe that Stardom is untrustworthy. 
* BNS and Block B separately released public statements on January 3rd. At the moment, the two are telling two different stories. Block B says that Stardom's statements should be read carefully and are put out with the intent to mislead the public. 
* Jaehyo retweeted the following things on December 19th : 

&gt; Usually, the person who gives the best advice is the person who lives holding onto the most problems.

&gt; Negative emotions are more contagious than positive emotions.

&gt; There are many times when someone who looks fun on the outside are actually depressed on the inside.

He followed up with tweets apologizing to fans for making them worry about him, and saying that he's not actually depressed.

* [BBOMB's twitter header has been changed](http://i.imgur.com/BptM9.jpg). It now reads ""Seven people together, forever"" on a picture with all seven members on a stage with fans in the background. 

* ~~Zico has unfollowed Stardom on twitter. As an artist, following all company related things and labelmates is standard practice. The other members are still following it.~~ Zico never followed Stardom in the first place.


Things that have not yet been confirmed 100% but are circulating:
---------------------


* They had little to no support from their company.
* P.O paid for all their stage outfits, out of pocket.
* Their staff worked for them using their own money.
* The “$7” comment that struck the Thai scandal was a jab at their company. Yes, this has been possibly going on for that long.

The controversial interview in question: 

&gt;ZICO: Tell us about the donations you usually make.  
KYUNG: Normally, every month I take 200,000 won from my account. (US$180)  
INTERPRETER: Where does it go?  
KYUNG: To kids in Africa.. yes. Because donating is helping, I think making donations is something indispensable in life, and even when we succeed later on I'd like to donate half of all that I have.  
INTERPRETER/OTHER MEMBERS: Half of all your fortune? You said that clearly. Oh~ Oh~  
KYUNG: No no, half of my salary. For one month, one month.  
**ZICO: What!?~ If it's going to be half of what you receive in one month, then in 3 months *at most*...**
   
&gt;(T/N: Here the interpreter cuts to the next question and you cannot hear what Zico said which made Kyung laugh.)

&gt;INTERPRETER: Would you happen to know that there were floods in Thailand?

&gt;ZICO: Yes, we know it..

&gt;KYUNG: Yes of course we know about it.

&gt;INTERPRETER: This is for the benefit of the victims of those damages.

&gt;BLOCK B: Ah~

&gt;ZICO: Ei of course we do, we know it. We think that everyone must have suffered greatly due to the floods, and we hope that this monetary compensation can help them recover. We have nothing but money...

&gt;KYUNG: How much did you say you have this time?

&gt;ZICO: Huh?

&gt;KYUNG: How much did you say you have this time?

&gt;ZICO: Me? 7,000... won... thereabouts? (US$6)*laughter*

* Zico and Kyung removed ""Block B"" because the name is copyrighted by Stardom
* Stardom used the money to build their new modern company building, which is still in the works. [This is a picture of the concept photo for it](http://i.imgur.com/XiGtj.jpg), they shared it on twitter in August 2012. 
* Zico's new twitter description says *""rapper,music producer Do'main Buckwilds""*. Buckwilds is the name of an old hiphop crew that his friend, Hanhae (of Phantom) used to belong to. Not sure if he used to be apart of it as well. It's kind of underground so it's unsure if it still exists or not as a group. Zico mentioned Do'main on episode one of MTV Matchup, when some guys came around during their music video shoot. Unsure of exactly who/what ""Do'main"" is, but they are friends. 
* Zico is leading this 'revolt' against Stardom
* Block B, if they decide to stay together, may be falling back on Brand New Music entertainment. Brand New Stardom used to be run by Cho PD and Rhymer, for reasons unknown (possibly disagreements?) Rhymer split off and started his own company called Brand New Music. The most logical company to move to would be this company because : 

a) It contains Hanhae (of Phantom). Hanhae trained with UKWON, Zico and Kyung as one of the five original Block B members. He was cut before debut. They're around the same age, they are probably still close friends. 

b) They noted Verbal Jint as a musical influence before. VJ is in the company. Zico also mentioned before that he really looks up to them.

c) Miss $, hiphop girl group, was in Brand New Stardom with Block B. They moved over to Brand New Music not too long ago, you may have heard the news a while back that [Stardom was suing BNM for taking them.](http://www.allkpop.com/2012/09/stardom-entertainment-files-lawsuit-against-brand-new-music-over-miss-s-new-single)

d) BNM's style is similar to Stardom, mostly hiphop oriented work. The other companies that other suggest, such as YG, JYP, SM, TS, are too different for them. I'm pretty sure YG would never allow Zico to go to clubs alone with a crew and rap a song called Cocks (which briefly mentions blowjobs). It will taint their name. YG is more hiphop and badass than, say, SM.. but it's not even close to what Stardom is. 

e) Rhymer is the owner of BNM. Block B mentioned before that Rhymer was the one who watched over them during auditions, practice and was their mentor during their trainee days, Cho PD was not too involved. He disciplined them over the phone, Rhymer was there in person. They probably are close with him because he watched them grow up and become stars. [Source.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG5bxJAUe1I)

* EvoL has never had good promotions. They hardly had any stages on music shows, any spots on variety/interviews and recycled their music video outfits many times for the lives that they did get. This suggests a problem with Stardom's funding, which only supports Block B's claim that Stardom did not help them out much. 

* There is a wanted poster found at the very beginning of Nillili Mambo's music video. The reward money is $77,000,000.. about the amount that Mr.Lee took. It may have been put there intentionally. 

* In Studio C (a show where Zico was a permanent member), Zico mentioned that he didn't bother getting a driver's license because he would have no money to drive anyways. He also made an offhanded comment about how he didn't like how management was running, but didn't explain further when Sangchu and Shorry J asked him about it. (needs validation)


FAQ:
---------------------


*But Cho PD isn’t involved because he’s not the CEO that took money right?*

* Nothing more has been confirmed on who is or is not actually involved. All we know is that Stardom was not paying, and Cho PD is the founder/owner of Stardom. Let your thoughts run.

*What will happen if Block B terminates their contract?*

* No one can know for sure.

*Isn’t this what happened to JYJ/DBSK?*

* Vaguely.

This is a collection of all the rumors/facts going around so far. 

Note : Decided to make this a self post because it was getting way too long, and I thought maybe some people who didn't catch it earlier could see it again (with the new things added). And, it would be easier to look for later on. Cheers! "	t5_2r1ox	True

Apparently these tweets were sent by the T-Ara members the last few days. All of this translation and everything below is from the above source, I can't read Korean so if anybody here can it'd be good if you could verify the translation.

&gt; Hyomin: It’s a difference between levels of dedication ^^ Let’s all be dedicated and hwaiting!!!!!!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Soyeon: It’s a difference in Dedication + Manners + Selflessness. Let’s be strong again today.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Jiyeon: Difference between levels of dedication ^^ Having manners ^^ Always staying polite^^ I applaud you, acting genius^^ RT Hyomin: It’s a difference between levels of dedication ^^ Let’s all be dedicated and hwaiting!!!!!!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Boram: Clapping… clapclapclap!! RT Jiyeon: Difference between levels of dedication ^^ Having manners ^^ Always staying polite^^ I applaud you, acting genius^^

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Eunjung: Just like a position can make a person, dedication can make a person too… sigh… such a pity. You should know look after the people around you. RT Hyomin: It’s a difference between levels of dedication ^^ Let’s all be dedicated and hwaiting!!!!!!

&amp;nbsp;

[[this](http://i.imgur.com/9I9gh.jpg) is apparently a screenshot of the tweets. I believe they have been pasted in the wrong order on this though, for example Hyomin's tweet was first.]

Hwayoung tweeted after the other members. Note: She has an injured ankle that is in a cast and is unable to perform fully at their concert.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Hwayoung: Sometimes dedication alone is not enough. At times like these, it might be disappointing but I still believe that God has a good reason for making this happen… God, you know all~ don’t you? Hoot~

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Hyoyoung (Hwayoung’s twin sister): My other half is going through suffering. It hurts to watch. No matter what anybody else says, Ryu, you can fight through it.

&gt;Hwayoung (in reply to Hyoyoung): …… there’s nobody but you… ah

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Tarae (Hwayoung’s rap coach): I know all empty-headed bitches act the same way but I wonder if there’s anything that could go beyond imagination like this. They think they made it… they’ve forgotten when they used to be nobodies, right??

&gt;Hwayong (to Tarae): Teach, I want to see you. [Translation literal, but can also be seen as “I miss you.”]

&amp;nbsp;

If there are any Korean speakers here, it'd be awesome if you could translate!

Like all other Korean articles I've posted, please be aware that I don't read Korean and am only going off of what others on twitter or GDD are saying! Will update with English sources when they're out.


Just to be clear, IU already announced that she was leaving and Minah is taking the spot that she left, she wasn't kicked out for Minah to replace her or anything (AFAIK of course). Just wanted to clarify in case the wording of my title was unclear.

I wanted to write about the concert for those of you interested in such things and my thoughts on his new song ""MichiGO."" Also, this is a spoiler alert for those who want to wait to see a DVD of the concert or are planning on going to one of the concerts themselves. Sorry, if I have accidentally ruined (or heightened) anything for you.

**BEFORE THE CONCERT:**
First, I want to describe the venue and fan experience leading up to when the concert starts. Now, most of you know about the level of fandom in KPOP that I don't think can be seen anywhere else. The first concert on GD's world tour was in Seoul at 6pm on 3/30. The venue was the Olympic Gymnastics Hall. I knew I had to go early in order to be able to get some One-of-A-Kind merchandise at the venue so I decided going to the stadium at 1pm was early enough. Well, I couldn't have been more wrong. Earlier that day I met a group of Japanese girls at the hostel I was staying at and they said they were leaving at 7am in the morning to get in line for merchandise and get in line for the standing VIP section. I thought that was too early so I decided to get there at 1pm because I only had seated tickets and only wanted a few things from the merchandise tents. Anyway, as I exited the subway towards the venue I quickly noticed I am in the 1%....maybe even the .1%. I think I was the only white foreign male attending the concert. There were lines upon lines upon lines already formed of fan-girls wearing tons of One-of-A-Kind merchandise and trying to get fan club merchandise as well. It was really interesting to see how hardcore these fans were. Many of them were wearing masks with GD's face on them. It was also interesting to see many Japanese fans attending the concert when I know Japan is GD's next stop on the world tour.

YG has great staff. Everyone working and helping at the concert were extremely helpful and very nice to deal with. Everyone I spoke to had passable English as well which was great because as a foreigner I get confused very easily. The precedings before the concert began all seemed to run very smoothly and YG ran it like a well oiled machine.

After 4 hours of waiting in lines for merchandise and ticket pick-ups they finally opened the doors to the stadium. If you have seated tickets then there is no rush to get there early but if you had standing tickets then I saw lines formed a longggg time ago and those little fangirls don't mess around. As soon as they entered the stadium they bombarded the gates closest to the stage and I think a few of them could try out for the olympic track and field team by how fast they sprinted. Many people didn't arrive until the very last minute but it looked like all the seats were sold out and the show was going to begin. The atmosphere of the event could make any casual fan get extremely excited and turn their fandometer up to 11. 

**THE CONCERT:**
When the lights turned off and a video began of GD racing in a car which looked like it had all been done with computer graphics, very tron-like. Then it shows GD get spun out by the other driver and it shows him about to crash and then **BOOM** the curtain drops and there is GD in what seemed like a crazy diamond-plated batmobile. GD stood up on the car and the crowd went nuts. GD wore a theme of gold/diamond/red/black clothes all night and looked completely in his element. His bright red hair was awesome and showed the fire he brought to stage performances. The lights from their BB sticks created an amazing view. Then we hear the words ""MichiGO!"" and a brand new song starts playing to start things off and this song was AMAZING. It is the perfect song to get crazy to and to pump up the crowd. The song has the potential to be up to ""Crayon"" levels of popularity. It seems like a hip-hop/rock anthem. It may have been just in the live performance but it had a really cool electric guitar/rock sound during the chorus and a heavy bass sound during the rap verses. Also I was surprised to hear ""Motha Fucka"" in the bridge of the song, but it seemed fitting of G-Boy. I'm excited to hear how they mix the final cut of the song. **Oh yeah, and here is a small video of the entire opening of the concert before it gets taken down by YG** [;)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=753q8ARsQeQ). 

The beginning of the concert was non-stop hype for about 20 minutes. After MichiGO he went directly into One-of-A-Kind with an army of shirtless male dancers. Then he never let up the momentum and went into Light-It-Up which is the bonus track with Tablo and Dok2. I'm glad that he didn't tone down any lyrics during the concert even though it said it was for ages 8 and up. A big expectation for this concert was who was going to give guest appearances. GD had done a few collabs with YG people and he has an entire album with TOP. Well, he met the fans halfway on this one. Tablo ran out on stage to perform with GD which was amazing. Then to push the hype and momentum over the edge was the next song ""The Leaders"" with Teddy and CL. Out of no where comes the absolutely stunning [""baddest female"" CL](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BiY-wBJma8). This lady exudes SO MUCH confidence and just general bad-assery it's amazing. She completely killed it while performing with GD and looked great doing it. GD even bent down and cleaned her heels with a towel and the fangirls went nuts. The program then started to slow down into more slow songs and old favorites like ""Missing You"" ""A Boy"" ""She's Gone."" Then a surprise appearance from Lee Hi singing alongside GD in ""Without You/Eventually."" Lee Hi's stage presence is still pretty bland and bad but whatever she lacks there she makes up with mind-blowing vocals. Mid-way through he even took up live mixing/DJ'ing and played a live mixed song with a sampling pad just like [Madeon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTx3G6h2xyA). It just showed how extremely talented he was with everything relating to music. He really impressed me with that.

He then turned the hype machine back on during the ""first"" ending of the concert with a mash up of Crayon and Fantastic Baby. After that the music stopped and people thought it was over but the lights never went on so many people were confused. It was like that for 5 minutes and then GD appears with on the side of the stage and has English bubbles pop up on the screen behind him saying ""Why are you here?"" ""Go home!"" and of course the crowd is screaming and then he started playing ""Heartbreaker"" and then ""Breathe."" Then he starts winding it down again and introduces and thanks his band and very warmly personally thanks everyone involved with making the concert happen, he even almost started [crying](http://24.media.tumblr.com/7f1da996c96c596869687bd03093a544/tumblr_mkh97xIWXO1rl9532o1_500.gif) a few times. Then he introduces his dancers and says BYE and they start walking back while everyone is chanting ""Encore"" (but in korean it sounds like the letter ""N"" and ""Core"" instead of 'Ahn-core""). GD hears it and stops, turns around and then tries to run back onto the stage but his dancers stop him and then music to his new and amazing song ""MichiGO"" starts playing and he ends the concert with a blast of swag and an awesome performance. I really think ""MichiGO"" is gonna be a huge hit like ""Crayon"" was for him. 

**FINAL THOUGHTS**
YG put on an amazing event. From the way everything was handled so orderly and smoothly to the staff to the production of the amazing stage with the huge screens and the STUNNING camera-work it was truly a great experience. 
GD is phenomenal. Not many solo artists can command a stage with so much confidence and swag for 2 hours like he did. I never thought for a second that the stage was bigger than the artist or that he shrunk in the spotlight. I really think GD is one of the best artists in the that nature right now. When him and CL were on stage together is was a like a new universe of swag was being formed. I'm also *extremely* impressed with his dancing skills, musical ability, and vocals. His dancing was spot on all night. GD is gifted with a music making abilities across any platform. He basically made a song live when he was fooling around with the sampling board and DJ'ing live and it sounded great. His vocals were impressive. He can rap with the best of them and also his singing ability is wayyyy better than I had previously thought. He did the acoustic rendition of ""That XX"" with his guitar player and it just showed how great he is as a singer which he doesn't sometimes get credit for.

The only disappointment I could say that I had was the lack of appearances by Big Bang members. Taeyang was at the stadium watching and GD went and hugged him during one of his walk-through-the-crowd moments, but that was it. GD made an entire album with TOP and he didn't even play a single song from that album at the concert. He may change this for later concerts and add in some GD&amp;TOP action if TOP is available but it was disappointing not hearing or seeing ""High-High"" or ""Knock-Out"" or ""Baby, Goodnight"" with TOP. TOP better be doing some important work elsewhere haha. This is the only issue I had though of an otherwise perfect event. If you ever get a chance to see this swag-machine of a man live, GO DO IT!

**OVERALL: 9.5/10**

(Sorry for the poor writing. You're welcome to ask any questions relating to the concert or venue and I will try my best to answer them. Also, sorry for lack of quality pictures. They were extremely strict on the ""no camera/photo"" policy. I saw 3 different people around me get thrown out because they were taking pictures/video.)

With the rocket of popularity of the video in the last three weeks, I can imagine this might have been asked here before (but didn't show up in my searches).

**I'm not looking for what the lyrics mean**. CNN focused on that and completely missed the obvious satire and blatant fun in the video. I am, however, looking for how this video fits into the broader context of K-Pop.

For me (and many others), Gangnam Style is the first exposure to K-Pop (in a very broad sense). From what I can gather, there are a bunch of cameos from other idols and K-Pop stars (like the guys jumping from the explosion, who are part of BigBang, also on his label, right?)

I'd love to know:

* Who are the other cameos in the video? (The guy in the elevator, the tall guy in the dance-off, etc)
* What are their relationships to PSY -- on the same label? Friends?
* How does PSY fit into the rest of the K-Pop landscape? This is a sort of a 'comeback' album, right? Was he super popular before?

Thank you all for taking the time. I'm just trying to get a deeper appreciation for a really, really fun song (and the best music video I've seen in years), steeped in an amazing culture I know very little about."	t5_2r1ox	True

One of the things we love to incorporate in our show is bad imitations of k-pop songs, it's pretty funny since we're all guys.

Long story short, some TV producers saw us singing Twinkle Twinkle earlier this year and they've invited us to do a broadcast later this week.... And it seems like they're bringing Girl's Day in for the show as well. I have no idea what's going to happen, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be hilarious. :)

If you have any other suggestions please feel free to comment but I only really want to keep this list containing higher quality remixes (i.e. not double speed or overlayed songs).

*Note: These are not all remixes available but simply the ones I feel are high enough quality for others to be recommended i.e. no/very few harmonization issues etc.*

**Edit: The list has now been split into remixes and mashups just to make it a little more obvious if it contains other tracks.**

There's a lot of parsing that I did for this so it may not be accurate 100%.

I group similar words into one, like ""song"" and ""songs"", ""dance"" and ""dancing"", ""k-pop"" and ""kpop"", ""favorite"" and ""favourite"", ""kara"" and ""kara's"", and many others.

The total is 75 words. Each word came up at least 100 times over the past month in this subreddit.

I originally made this list for a [forum I frequent]( http://forum.jphip.com/index.php?topic=34519.0), but figured it would be of use to more people here! I only included performers who had a music video or televised performance on youtube, so some groups that released music but had no video aren't included. (Let's face it, they're probably dead anyway!) Note that the linked video isn't necessarily their debut song. 

Use this list to meet, look back on and discuss the rookies of 2012! I have to warn you, not all of them are worth knowing... But there are also some quite good ones in there :)

(I realize the year hasn't ended yet and someone might still debut. I'm still waiting for Supearls and that other new YG girl group...)

Then they uploaded their guerrilla performances/promotions in attempts to help them get on said shows. It made me a little sad to the possibility that a unique group might not be able to make it past their rookie years.

For those who don't know what it is, SHINee were allowed to go on a short holiday wherever they wanted, and they were in charge of their own vacations. Onew went to Krabi in Thailand to chill and eat, Jonghyun went to Japan to visit as a tourist rather than going there to work, Taemin went to Switzerland to do extreme sports, and Minho and Key went to London - Minho for football and Key for shopping. They all then proceeded to be stupidly adorable and make SHAWOLs everywhere squee to death.

So today my band and I taped our Starking appearance. We sang with Girl's Day - at least, three of them, Minah must have known I'm dangerous and stayed away.

I never realized just how young those girls are - but they were totally charming, super professional and heaps of fun. Then we did a couple of songs with Brown Eyed Girls, who came across as... Sort of grumpy.

I don't know how our singing went, but we had an awesome time with the new hosts, Boom and Teuk (ex super junior) and it was a pretty damn hilarious day all up, once all the waiting around was out of the way. They seemed to think we kicked some butt, so who knows, it could lead us somewhere. :)

it's going to air in late November, I'll get a copy when I can and stick it on YouTube - but yeah, I thought you guys would appreciate what a crazy day I just had! :D"	t5_2r1ox	True

1363048940.0	1a48ee	Lets make together by posting and voting K-pop playlists for every mood!	mwff	77	11	17	"I saw this done at /r/hiphopheads and realised I would love to have many kinds of only k-pop playlists or to discover new tracks of certain type.

**So how it would work:**

* Each week we set a theme or mood for a playlist
* Unlimited comments per person
* You add a Youtube link for any song you post
* If a link gets 10 upvotes it makes it to the list
* Top 50% makes it to the list. 

By the next week I make a youtube/spotify/somethingelse compliation of the songs that made it along with the new topic for playlist.

I would really like to hear if you guys are interested and opinions about everything

**Edit**
Yay!  I think  people really like this idea, so lets start a soon as possible, I'm thinking about narrowing down to 10 weeks-10 playlist, so far here the possible list but we can add or change the topics if you guys want:

*  Happy/ Mood boster
* Romantic / Cheesy
* OST songs
* Workout/Hype
* Sad / Heartbroken
* Oldschool k-pop
* Hip-hop oriented
* New Artists/ Indie Artist
* Chill / Mellow
* Partay!"	t5_2r1ox	True

&gt;*There will be a special artist also collaborating with the girls on the song, and although the identity hasn’t been revealed yet, rest assured that they’re world famous in that they’ve already amassed over 40 million likes on Facebook.*


The Wonder Girls are going to make a US release with an artist that has over 40 million likes on Facebook. That actually narrows it down quite a lot, because only a few artists have that many likes. The possible artists are therefore: Eminem, Linkin Park, Akon, Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry. I think it's most likely one of the final 2 as they would fit the Wonder Girls style most, whereas the others are more mature in style.

* The Wonder Girls [have met](http://edwinruser.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/2012040201000044900003841.jpg) Katy Perry [multiple times](http://cdn2.mixrmedia.com/wp-uploads/ningin/blog/2010/08/katywg.jpg) before.
* The Wonder Girls have used the same fashion stylist as Katy Perry. 
* The Wonder Girls have named Katy Perry as one of their favourite artists.
* Katy Perry [has said ](http://blog.ningin.com/2010/08/01/california-girl-katy-perry-wants-to-work-with-the-wonder-girls/?from=rss) that she wants to work with them.
* Katy Perry is probably the closest fit to their style out of the possible artists.

All the information is completely anonymous. I'll have the results out once I feel we've had enough people fill it out.

And let me know if there's any problems!

**Edit**: Oh, and sorry if I didn't get your favorite group. I got most of the more popular one's, so hopefully it's enough.

**Edit 2**: Added multiple answers for Favorite Groups, but please don't just go around checking all the groups you like. Reserve it only for your absolute favorite groups if you can't decide on just one.

Also added ""Streaming"" for ""*How do you get your music*.""

**Edit 3:** **Well, it appears you have to pay extra to have more than 100 form submissions a month! If I were to upgrade my account it'd cost $14.99 a month.**

So.... looks like this turned out well.

**Edit 4:** The user jayg28 said I could use Google Docs to create a poll, so I'm working on that right now. I'll try and have it up as soon as I can. Thanks!

So the plan was to host a 128-song tournament, which is still happening, but to maximise the amount of competitors (and minimise the amount of nominations that people may have felt went to waste), a pre-tournament will be held, from which 16 different songs will emerge victorious and secure the last 16 places in the main tournament (112 have already been given to the most-nominated songs). This brings the total of songs competing in both the main tournament and this qualification tournament to 240.

The qualifying tournament will be held over the next four days, and will be much more brief and streamlined than the main tournament, with a different voting process. There will be no match-ups, only 16 groups consisting of 8 different songs, and each day 4 of those 16 groups will be revealed. Your role as voter: vote for your favourite song in each group. Once 24 hours have passed, the song with the most votes from each of the 4 groups will be crowned the winner of that group, and will secure one of the 16 remaining places in the main tournament, which will begin once this qualifying tournament concludes.

So, I hope that wasn't too confusing! Here are today's four groups! Remember, post in the comments with only the name of your selected song. I will post an example of a voting comment in the comments that you can follow. **Unlike with nominations, you do not have the option of PMing me!**

A couple of footnotes: if, once 24 hours have passed, there is not a single winner based on amount of votes, voting will be extended ONLY UNTIL somebody's votes put one of the songs in front, at which point that one song will be deemed victorious. Also, I will probably not be using a 'central hub' self-post that contains to links to everything else; I will probably just put everything necessary into the one post each day.

**TL;DR: This is a pre-tournament to be held before the main one to allow as many songs as possible to compete in some way; choose your favourite song in each of the  groups shown above; winner of each group advances to main tournament. This voting formula is for this qualifying tournament ONLY, not the main one.**"	t5_2r1ox	True

&gt;The singer’s wake is currently being held at the funeral center of the Asan Hospital, where family and friends have gathered to pay their respects. Sung In Kyu previously revealed his diagnosis with thymus cancer through a touching letter to his fans back in 2011. Since then, he had been fighting his battle with the disease through continuous chemotherapy treatments.

&gt;Park Jung Jin bid farewell to his fellow member on his Twitter, writing “In Kyu, a dongseng who I promoted with as a member of A’st1 has passed away today. He must have had a difficult time undergoing chemotherapy but he always answered the phone with a cheerful voice, that was the kind of person In Kyu was. I hope he will be able to close his eyes in peace now in heaven.”

&gt;Sung In Kyu made his debut as a member of A’st1 back in 2008 and promoted songs like “Dynamite” and also sang the OST song “Yearning of the Heart” for the hit drama ‘Boys Over Flowers‘.

&gt;May he rest in peace, and our hearts go out to all his loved ones.

The duo also announced that they will be releasing their first mini album on January 17th through several online music sites!

Jiyoon had originally tweeted two pictures of ’2Yoon’, attracting much attention from fans both in Korea and overseas. The [tracklist](http://static.allkpop.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/20121227_doubleyoon_tracklist-600x600.jpg) for the new album was also recently revealed.

’2Yoon’ completed recording their album and filming their music video late last month, and will be trying a new genre never before used in K-pop as their title song, bringing a fresh new concept to the table. Fans are excited for the new combination, especially as the members of ’2Yoon’ are also the well-known main vocalists for 4minute. This will be the second major unit project released by Cube Entertainment, following the success of Troublemaker.

’2Yoon’ has already seen a great response during the 2011 ‘United Cube in London‘ concert. Check out one of their tracklist here, and don’t forget to tune in to their new album on January 17th!

Now for the final match-up, between the most nominated song prior to the tournament (Genie), and the most dominant song throughout the tournament (Gee)!

Also, I'd just like to thank Nerdrockess and Dwesk in particular. BIGBANG's Beautiful Hangover received both of its nominations from these two users, and it was listening to this song and watching its MV during the group stages that got me into BIGBANG, a group whose brilliance I wasn't really aware of prior to that song getting me absolutely hooked on them. 

To tell you the truth, before I decided to host this tournament, I had the least interest in K-pop that I'd had since I started listening to it early last year, but I've finally found a group that I can literally fangirl over to the point of already buying their merchandise (I'd never bought an Asian artist product before, despite having listened to J-pop since 2005), and my newfound interest in this group has restored my interest in K-pop as a whole. If I hadn't decided to host this tournament, I don't know if or when I'd have gotten into BIGBANG, so I'm incredibly happy that I did. :)

Once again, thanks everyone for making this worthwhile!

**There is a list of accounts whose votes will not be accepted. All accounts are being checked, just FYI!**

The rules:

* 24 hours to vote (starting 10:00 EST / 14:00 GMT) for one song in each blue match-up
* All votes should be submitted via the comment box and never as a reply to somebody else's votes
* REVISED TIEBREAKER RULE: If, after the 24-hour deadline, two songs are tied, the votes for both songs will be reset to 0, and the match-up will be repeated in the next day's set of votes to determine the winner after another 24 hours.
* Any remix or alternate version spawned from any of the songs listed is a valid option when voting; it is still the same song, just arranged differently!
* This is obvious, but christ, don't use multiple accounts to vote lol that is so cheap

1348624004.0	10hfv7	[Discussion] On Gangnam Style's Influence on Western Perceptions of K-pop and Asians	TearsOfThree	75	14	43	"Recently, there has been a scandal brewing as Tiger JK unleashed a racist rant - against whites in particular - during a recent concert. The story goes that he was taunted by a few members of the audience to perform the ""horse dance"" popularized by Gangnam Style. He responded by launching a tirade against whites and Western Media as a whole for which he later apologized. You can read more about it at his [twitter](https://twitter.com/DrunkenTigerJK), or in [this article](http://chincha.co.uk/2012/09/the-creators-project-2/).

The issue of racial discrimination against Asians in popular media is well-known and well-discussed: there are the typical arguments of Asians only displayed in terms of action/martial arts, typical projections of stereotypes (as the nerd, the exotic Asian woman, etc.), or simply in absolutely ridiculous over-the-top ways such as ""Chang"" in Community. There really is a dearth of ""serious"" Asian actors, and whether or not that is because they have a much smaller base to choose from (Asians remain a small percentage of the population in Western society), cultural reasons (Asian people are more predisposed to go into STEM fields, for example), or some other reason, it's not really the point of this post to discuss - and I'm quite sure I don't have the necesssary capability to do so.

The introduction of Gangnam Style, however, into mainstream media is something unique: it was never a serious attempt to promote K-pop or Asian music outside of Korea a la the WonderGirls, Rain, BoA, or Utada (all of whom ultimately failed, and I unfortunately have included the WonderGirls due to their neverending impending debut in America). 

The music video being what it is - a critique of a facet of Korean culture - did not stay that way. Once it breached the waters of western media, it has evolved into something else: a purely comical music video that portrays Psy not so much as the satirist he is, but as a grown man doing this silly dance to words they don't understand. Furthermore, not only is it a portrayal of Psy as a rather buffoonish man, it is something now that Koreans and Asians in general have to be associated with. Any attempt of K-pop to reach western audiences, for better or worse, will also be judged with respect to Gangnam Style.

This is not a big deal in itself, but when Asian stereotypes have always been rather negative - whether it be as the geek, the socially-inept, or the guy with the ridiculous foreign accent - adding in this new phenomena is understandably uncomfortable. To many, it could be a feeling of reaffirmation that Asians cannot be taken seriously, whether in Hollywood or in everyday society. The former could be laughed off, but the latter is very worrying. 

Everything being said, this is not the fault of Psy: I doubt anyone could have predicted that this music video could have skyrocketed him to this current level of fame, and even if they did, it is still well within his right to do whatever the hell he wants with his music. 

But I just want to say, in light of Tiger JK's rants, and in no way condoning them, I hope his underlying message gets through as well. It's unfortunate his response would be forever tainted by racism, and I wish he had articulated himself without such comments. 

But his statement regardless holds true: that a person should always be treated with respect because of *who they are* and not because of *who you want them to be.* 

**EDIT:**

I'm glad everyone seems to be talking about this quite frankly, even if you disagree.

Some of my follow up thoughts however:

A few people are arguing that Gangnam Style has no effect on the way people perceive Asians and the reinforcement of stereotypes. I have to admit that arguing one way or another is pretty futile: it's something that is almost impossible to quantify, and if tried, I don't think the results would be too accurate anyway. 

That being said, it is in my personal opinion that I don't think that's even slightly possible. When a social phenomenon becomes as large as Gangnam Style has become, there is almost certainly going to be a link between the person of interest and his race. While everyone can sit around and argue that race is a social construction that is from a bygone era, it is very much something that affects a great deal of people today. 

You can argue that the people who think stereotyping is something only idiots do, and we shouldn't care about idiots, but that's simply ignoring the issue. When a kid in elementary school gets bullied because of the kind of food he brings to eat for lunch, can you console him by saying those bullies are simply idiots? No, I know from personal experience that doesn't fucking work at all. There was a post on the frontpage a week ago or so about a recently arrived Chinese classmate who was getting bullied by his peers, and the redditor was asking if he could do anything to help. Yeah, I'm sure that person will feel really great when you tell him that everyone in his class are idiots and stereotyping is only something idiots do and not to worry about them.

My reason for getting on this soapbox is that this line of reasoning is absolutely pointless when trying to deal with an issue. Dismissing it as a stereotyping and the kind of racism it is liable to become as simply the product of idiocy you don't want to deal with is not the appropriate answer. 

Now, is Gangnam Style going to perpetuate any negative stereotypes, for sure? I don't know, and I don't have all the answers. I personally think it does because most people who watch don't recognize the underlying sarcasm and it only perpetuates the comedic Asian who's only funny becomes he does these incomprehensible things. Are Asians going to be only looked at this way by western civilization? 

Of course not, but it certainly doesn't help the portrayal of Asians in society when they're simply trying to be viewed as equals and taken seriously for who they are instead of being the butt of all these asinine martial art/human calculator/starcraft playing jokes."	t5_2r1ox	True

My friend and I recently started an Etsy store for shirts we make that are K-pop related. We wanted a way to get shirts outside South Korea that are affordable and high quality, and we decided to share with other fans looking for the same. 

We started with a bunch of stuff for SNSD's ""I Got A Boy"" comeback, but we're starting to expand to include lots of other groups.

As the fine folks over at /r/snsd can tell you, we make very good quality shirts for very good prices.

If you want to check out what we've got so far, check out our store:

**http://www.etsy.com/shop/kpopgear**

I also set up a coupon code for 15% off for all of you: **kpopreddit**

We're still new, so we're looking for ideas and suggestions for what you would like to see from our store. Hopefully this gives you all a chance to get unique shirts for good prices. 

Thanks so much for your support, and don't hesitate to ask any questions or make requests for groups/designs! We'll do our best to come up with something!"	t5_2r1ox	True

1354111963.0	13xm6w	TIL there is Android app today that has full english subbed K-Pop music videos.  What other apps do you want to share?	Sephorria	61	6	22	"I was told by a friend about this [Android app called Viki](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viki.android&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDNd).  It allows you to stream fan subbed K-shows and music videos straight to your device.  I really wish I had known about this sooner!  

There's a few more ads than I care for, but the app is free, and it's subbed by fans.

What other apps do you know of, that are relevant to K-Pop, that you want to share? "	t5_2r1ox	True
