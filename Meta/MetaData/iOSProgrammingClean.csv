In January, my friends and I were sitting around, and had one of those ""wouldn't it be great if there was an app for this?"" ideas.  Now I know those ideas are a dime a dozen, but I decided that it didn't sound too complex, and that I might be able to do it.

The app is called 'Back To Here,' and basically allows you to set a bookmark at your current location, and points you back in the direction of that bookmark if you ever select it later.  So you can use it to remember where you parked, where you're meeting up with people later, where you left your gear, etc.

Working through a couple different subreddits (including this one) and two iTunesU courses, I got a basic understanding of XCode and Objective-C.  I submitted my app last week and it was approved yesterday!

I'm super excited, nothing I've ever written has had other people using it.  I'm here to tell everyone to stick with your hobby projects, it feels so good to look at the iTunes page with my name on it."	t5_2s61a	True

[Accessorizer](http://www.kevincallahan.org/software/accessorizer.html) - Boilerplate code generator. Converts ivars to properties, etc.

[Alcatrack](http://mneorr.github.io/Alcatraz/) - A plugin manager that integrates directly with XCode, becoming part of it's menus, code completion, etc.

[AppleDoc](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/) - Apple-style documentation generator. Like Doxygen, but the outputted docs look like Apple's and they integrate very nicely with XCode.

[Code Pilot](http://codepilot.cc/) - Project navigator. Makes it easy to find files and text snippets.

[Color Picker](http://panic.com/~wade/picker/) &amp; [ColorSense](https://github.com/omz/ColorSense-for-Xcode) - Graphical UIColor editors. ColorPicker turns a color from anywhere on the screen, picked with an eyedropper, into a UIColor instantiation. ColorSense turns a color picked from a pallet into a UIColor instantiation, and displays the actual color of a UIColor when it is selected.

[Completion Dictionary](http://www.obdev.at/products/completion-dictionary/index.html) - Extension of the built-in smart code completion. E.g., type in the initials of a method, press enter, and it will complete the method.

[Dash](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dash-docs-snippets/id458034879?mt=12) - Extended Local Documentation. Includes documentation for everything from Cocos2D to MongoDB

[Google Toolbox for Mac](http://code.google.com/p/google-toolbox-for-mac/) - A large collection of XCode plugins. Provides unit testing libraries, code coverage, analyzers, etc.

[Mogenerator](http://rentzsch.github.com/mogenerator/) - Code generator for custom Core Data classes. Manages two classes per entity: one for machines, one for humans.

[Themes](https://github.com/jbrennan/xcode4themes) - A bunch of color schemes for the editor.

[XCode Colors](https://github.com/robbiehanson/XcodeColors) - Colors certain log statements. For example, it can display error statements in red.

[XCode Fixins](https://github.com/davekeck/Xcode-4-Fixins) - Various XCode extras. Automatically adds the ""ignore case"" option when you hit CMD-F, highlights the line currently being edited, etc.

I've just began writing some technical blog posts quite recently, here's the first, slightly chunky post I have written so far. 

It's a little beginners guide on working with blocks in Objective-C and when you would use them. I haven't went into detail on memory and history. I made this decision based on the target audience, as I develop for iOS myself, I don't often find myself riddled with memory problems. I can see how this would be an issue on larger applications though and I might add something around this down the line.

Anyway, I thought you guys might appreciate it, or at least find something to critique on it and shout some feedback at me for it!
Have a read, if you find it interesting maybe drop a reply mentioning why. If you find it terrible do the same. Any feedback is more than welcome as I am a complete blog newbie!

I'm a ux/visual designer working exclusively with mobile, 90% iPhone. I'm currently building up content for a design blog, so rather than write a load of content just for designers, I'd like to write stuff so that anyone developing an app can pick up basics of design and apply good ux principles easily.

I have a bunch of ideas and a few articles written, but from a dev point of view is there anything, from photoshop tutorials to prototyping methods to basic ux/usability articles, that you guys would like to read about?

I was unsure whether pimping is allowed in here or not so I won't post a link to the blog unless I get the all clear! 

Happy to answer any general questions here about design &amp; ux if you have any too. 

EDIT: As pointed out by [bennyguitar] (http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/1fvijj/what_would_you_like_to_know_about_ux_visual/caei4cb) the blog is very relevant to this subreddit so the URL is [www.pocketux.com](http://www.pocketux.com). Funnily enough, even though there are only 3 articles right now, 2 are very relevant to a few of the questions being asked. I'd recommend you guys follow the twitter account as I've got about 8 articles in draft format which I hope to have published in the coming weeks. Thanks!"	t5_2s61a	True

This usually happens when moderators aren't paying attention to the subreddit so they don't catch the false positives in the spam filter.  Then one day they decide to check, and a month's worth of submissions get released all at once.

We've got submissions like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/1hmwu8/requesting_feedback_on_my_nonib_view_with/) - asking for feedback - getting ignored for a month because nobody saw it.

I've seen this happen three or four times in this subreddit.  The last time it happened, I messaged the moderators asking if they needed help and I was ignored.  It's not like they aren't active on Reddit - just uninterested apparently.

Can we do something about this?  I don't want to see people's submissions disappear into the spam filter just because the moderators can't be bothered checking the moderation queue more often than once a month.  As I understand it, AutoModerator can auto-approve submissions.  If they don't want to add any more real moderators, how about they set that up instead?

tl;dr:

* iOS users download more apps (offers more revenue per app).
* Android users are ""phone"" first, ""smartphone"" second.
* more developers with iOS experience in the community.
* iOS is not as segmented as android (predictable screen size, capabilities)
* iOS is easier to develop beautiful UI design/animation/transition.

Built with students and freelance creatives in mind.   

------
A little more about me and the app:

My name is Julian Thayn, a UI/UX designer by trade, I've been designing professionally for 6+ years and in January of last year I took up the task of teaching myself how to program iOS applications (with no programming experience). 

A year later and with a few contract apps under my belt I set off on my own and developed Clocked.  Clocked was born out of a frustration towards the time tracking programs I've been unhappily using for years while designing. Whether it be desktop, web or mobile they've all been a huge disappointment--cluttered, ugly UI, unintuitive, overcomplicated and with features I didn't need or care about.  

I set out to make an app that was simple to use, and beautiful to look at. I wanted an app that was flexible to whatever a user was trying to accomplish with their time. An app that had all the features that one would need to get things done efficiently whether it be working, studying, reading or what have you. 

I believe I accomplished this and am proud to introduce Clocked!

1350572758.0	11owun	Enterprise iOS app deployment tip.	aazav	25	6	6	"As some of us know, all of Apple's certificates, provisioning, code signing and deployment can be an utterly maddening experience.

I ran into a situation that was rather maddening last week, semi solved it last night, still don't know why or how it happened, and though I would save some people's sanity in explaining the problem and how it was fixed.

Situation:
An enterprise signed iOS app that I distributed ala ""OTA"" installation (simply over an internal web site) was built from my Mac to a device, tested, archived, installed and successfully downloaded on and since July 24th, 2102.

Last week, I got a fix from one of my employees and went to build to the same device and test.  

The app built successfully, opened on the iPhone, loaded the splash screen, the first screen, fetched and processed data from the internet and then quit without throwing an error.  

No SIGABRT, no SIGTERM.  Just quit.

Xcode reports ""Process cannot be found"".

W T F ?

Nothing useful in the console output, nothing useful in the organizer console output on the device.  Nothing.

I looked and all my certs and provisions were legit and able to be used to distribute the app.  I walked the source code tree back all the way to July 24th and the same thing happened with EVERY SINGLE code snapshot.

How the hell can something like this happen?  Why did it happen?  These questions remain unanswered.

I compared the app's build and code signing settings to that of another project I built to the device and deployed two weeks ago.  They matched, but therein lay the problem.

For code signing, I was using the distribution profile for debug and release versions of the app on the executable target.  This WORKED FINE on the iPad app that I released two weeks ago, but some note on StackOverflow mentioned that you can't build to a device using a distribution profile.

Assuming that the fact that I was able to build to a device and got this to work for the iPad project at 5 AM, I considered that I should simply try changing the debug code signing profile to our generic app profile.  

Viola.  It worked.  I was able to build to the device.

Now, I have no idea how or why this worked before, but it's simply insane that Apple does not even throw an error when trying to assign a dist profile to an executable and then trying to run on an iOS device.  

In any case, if you find this happening to you, where you try to run an app on a device and it quits with no error after a successful launch, check to make sure you haven't applied your distribution certificate to the Debug section of your target app's code signing.

I still have no idea why or how this worked in the past, why it works in another project and if it changed at some point, how or why that happened.
It's entirely possible that I assumed that I was building to the device or only looked at code that was checked in AFTER I changed the code signing.  No idea.  I'm just glad it works, it installs properly (even to the other side of the planet) and if this happens again, I know what to do.  But DAMMIT APPLE, at least throw some error messages in cases like this.

1371012072.0	1g6d20	For new apps. Go ahead with iOS 6 or wait for iOS 7 release?	Kasuist	21	2	17	"I have an app I've been working on for about 3 months now, and in the past, new iOS updates haven't really changed a whole lot, especially to the look of the entire UI, so there was never really any concern on changing much about how your app looks between OSes

In a recent WWDC video titled ""Building user interfaces for iOS 7"" however , the developers behind it mention that all devs should start focussing on iOS 7 now as to make the most of the changes. 

What I'm stuck on is, I still have a few weeks left before the project is finished. Do I build and release it for iOS 6 (with all the old ui elements) or should I focus on really getting it polished and set for iOS 7, and just wait if I finish early? There's also the new dynamic text APIs to consider too.

Apple mentioned in the keynote that well over 90% of users are on the latest version of iOS. So I'm not too worried about leaving users out, and since it's a new app, I won't be versioning out previous customers anyway. 

What would you guys do, are you doing? I'm sure there's a few different ways to go about it.

EDIT: We should also consider iPad only apps in the discussion since if we wanted to release only on iOS 7 we would have to wait until Apple puts out support for it.

1373110536.0	1hqtfx	Promoting an app	klassobanieras	20	3	20	"[My app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id663567628) just hit the store a couple of days ago, and I'm starting to realise that my attitude of ""if you build it they will come"" is not really gonna cut it.

It's a comic-book reader, and I'm obviously biased but it's a cool app that does genuinely differentiate itself from the bazillion other comic-readers out there. My basic pitch is that it's the comic reader that cares about image-quality - it does custom upscaling that preserves line-art, high-quality downscaling, sub-pixel antialiasing, motion-blurred panning, and so on; the goal is to make any decent medium-res comic look retina-quality.

So I've submitted it to the more obvious sites, but I'm sure they get a bazillion apps submitted every day and I really wouldn't blame them if they just closed the email upon seeing the words ""iPad comic-reader"". Beyond that I don't really have any ideas for promoting it, and if I'm honest I don't have much aptitude for that kind of thing either.

Halp? Suggestions (or just a pep-talk) would be really appreciated.

PS: I'm running low on promo codes but am happy to dispense a few if anyone wants to take a look, PM me and apologies in advance if I run out

1372087289.0	1gz0tf	iOS developer here looking for a buddy or two to build some fun apps. Anyone else looking for the same?	gnovos	22	6	19	"I'm not talking about starting a company, or even any serious attempt to make money, I just *love* Objective-C and love writing apps.  

I've got at least a dozen almost finished games and utilities, but my problem is that I don't really have the commitment to follow through and compete any of them when I'm only just dicking around on my own.  As soon as life gets in the way and I have a lull in development I usually end up moving on to something else by the time I'm free again, basically abandoning the project to the git graveyard...

If you're in a similar boat, maybe we could collaborate on our old apps (and create some new ones!), and have some fun!  

If we all work well together we *could* start a company someday, who knows?  But if that happens later it's a whole 'nother thing we'll talk about later.  For *now* I am thinking everyone who wants to join will all agree that this is more for fun than work and just do free apps in our spare time.  If that's cool with you and this sounds interesting, PM me with an email address and I'll set up a mailing list and later this week we can figure out what to tackle first!

Cheers!

I'd just buy it and run with it, but if it's no better than the Stanford course it'd be easier to stick with what's free. Thanks!

Due to time constraints, we haven't done anything with it for almost a year, but it still manages 200-300 downloads a week. We in the middle of revamping our entire retail operation, and have envisioned several ways to tightly integrate the app with our shopping experience, though this probably wouldn't happen for another 6-9 months.

Recently, however, a large company in the same product space (not so much a competitor as a co-existor) has approached us about either buying our app or partnering with us in some way, and we're really not sure how to respond.

We've spent considerable amount of money as well as months of our own time in developing the app, so selling is definitely appealing. While I've always thought licensing was better in the long run, we aren't sure what the advantage is for us - we don't have the time to actively develop, and the rebranded app wouldn't drive any traffic to our business.

We also have some brick and mortar retail partners that has expressed low level interest as using our app as a sort of in-store kiosk (which most likely would drive traffic to us), but that's something we haven't even begun to explore either.

I could see us ""leasing"" the app, where we maintain it for a certain length of time and the other company pays rebranding, our time, and further development. At the end of the lease, we'd have made some money and would also have a better app. I'm not sure if this is feasible, however, because they certain have in house IT resources that I imagine are at least as capable as I am.

My questions, then: What are the pros and cons of selling and licensing? Are there other partnership opportunities that we should explore? Any tips for questions we should be asking ourselves and our suitors?

Thanks.

MKevin3	16	3	43	"Apple appears to be kicking around the idea of some new device sizes for both the iPad and iPhone which I think is a good idea at least on the iPhone side. I personally have a Note II and enjoy the larger size and extra content real estate. Not sure I would want a 13"" tablet but maybe they are thinking Air with touch screen.

What will this do to your programs? 

Are you using auto layout and are you happy with the results? 

Do you truly feel it will scale? 

Do you do a universal app (runs on both iPad and iPhone from one code base using full screen resolution for each)?

The apps I have written are business based, not games. They have been universal - one code base with IF statements to do things differently between iPad and iPhone. The first one did not use ARC as it was not used widely enough at the time. Since then I have used ARC but have not yet use auto layout.

Android was done with various screen resolutions in mind from the start. Some went nuts with the ""fragmentation"" word due to that. For my PC (MS, MacOS, Linux) programming I never considered having multiple screen size to be fragmentation. I coded to resize as needed and to take advantage of multiple monitors when possible.

Apple was happy with hard coded resolution for a long time and then just doing 2x or 4x from there as to not screw up existing code. I am not sure they can keep that up. The iPhone 5 was a start and made developers rethink how some code should work.

So far I've learned most from the Stanford iOS development lectures on Core Data (Lectures 12,13,14). From what I understand from these is that the best way to obtain a Managed Object Context is by storing a UIManagedDocument, and retrieving the context from that every time the app runs.

Is that what I should be doing? I feel like I'm misunderstanding something since this seems vastly different then having all of the core data junk in the app delegate. And the fact that I still don't understand what a UIDocument really is, or a UIManagedDocument (besides the fact that it's a UIDocument with core data). What's the difference between working with a managed object context through a UIManagedDocument and through the app delegate?


And since I have to access the database through two different view controllers, should I be using two separate contexts to access it, or should I create a singleton-type convenient class so I only have to use one?






**EDIT**: Just remembered UIMangedDocuments autosave their core data database. So if I don't use the document method of obtaining a context, I have to explicitly save?"	t5_2s61a	True

Early in this book a knowledge of the C language is mentioned as a requirement for learning Objective-C and iOS programming.

I have several years of programming experience, mostly in the .NET world, but I haven't written an actual C program since I was in school. Should I dust off my K&amp;amp;R and re-read it, or just dive into iOS programming and fill in any gaps in my knowledge as I go?

Edit: the consensus seems to be that studying C again is not too critical, and possibly even counterproductive. Honestly I think the only area my rust would show is in in interpreting funky declarations like ""an array of pointers to functions taking an integer and returning a pointer to a function taking and returning int"", which I'm unlikely to encounter much (or at all) in Objective-C programming.

I'm the same, and have been learning and developing for about 8 months (just about to submit my first app. Yay!).

I've been seeing increasing numbers of platforms/frameworks/etc that enable developers to write apps using other technologies (specifically HTML5 and CSS), then cross-compile to various platforms as ""native"" apps (as opposed to being mini websites displayed inside a container app).

This is great in the bigger scheme of things, as it lowers the barrier to entry into the mobile application space, shortens development times, yadda yadda yadda... However, as someone who has a vested interest in recouping the time and effort I've expended to become a competent iOS developer, I'm worried that this trend will have the effect of diluting the opportunities I will have to make a living from the platform.

Do other subredditors have any experience with these sorts of frameworks? Anyone considered the impact they may have on their future employment prospects? Is it a case of just sucking it up - given that change is the nature of what we do - and looking for other opportunities? Maybe focusing on the toolset and development support sectors?

MrGrim	16	6	30	"I've been having a lot of trouble getting my ""Official Imgur App"" into the app store, even though many third party Imgur apps exist already. The app has been rejected 4 times based on content. Here is the whole conversation with them: http://imgur.com/a/pkhMm

They see Imgur's user generated content, which contains memes and things that *may* be copyrighted, and are rejecting the app based on that. However, all that content comes straight from the internet and the app is not ""including"" it. It's no different from any other app that loads content in from the internet, including the 6 other Imgur apps that have the exact same functionality.

I'm pretty much at a loss here and have decided to submit an appeal to the Apple review board. However, I have no idea what to expect in an internal Apple “review” process. Can Imgur submit a formal opinion letter from counsel? Are any IP attorneys involved in the review process?
 
I understand that Apple can turn down anything it wants – it’s not beholden to any law or standard, and just because they approved unofficial Imgur apps in the past, if they don’t feel like approving the official one, then they don’t have to. It’s a very opaque process, almost big-brother-esque. You approach on bended knee and, from outside the castle gates, plead with the high priests for an indulgence. So unlike a normal legal appeal, you can’t go by normal legal standards and logic. You have to figure out what they want.

1376509817.0	1kdbif	For those who do both iOS and Android - does the Apple review process annoy you or make you a better coder?	MKevin3	13	2	46	"I write and release apps for both Android and iOS. They have been corporate use with login required so nothing to post / brag about. They are free apps with niche markets.

The Android side is really simple. Create the app, put it on the store and update as you see fit. It is about a 20 minute end to end process.

The iOS side is not so simple. Create the app, try to make super sure you did not do anything that would annoy Apple. Build it and I don't find archive to be a logical name for getting ready to build for the store - submit it and hope like all get out they accept it the first time. If you get rejected try to understand why. If you need to do a patch release start the whole process over. It may take 1 day or 10 days, you just don't know.

Since the iOS side is scary / annoying / drawn out I think it forces you to really think about your program. You want a solid QA process. You want to triple check things as you don't want to get rejected. I don't care for fear when programming though. I don't get happy thoughts about Apple. I have been rejected for unfounded reasons. I have been rejected for good reasons - they found a crashing bug. I have been accepted then done a bug fix that was rejected then accepted when I started asking why. They had picked the wrong thing in a drop down combobox, accidents will happen. I was totally at their mercy for two weeks and my clients were pissed they could not get the bug fix. My fault, my bug but Apple ended up getting in the way.

You don't get much in the way of crash reports from Apple either. Their store statistics are not very good.

As for Google / Android I have neither love nor hate. I publish the app, I can fix a bug and have a new version out nearly instantly. I don't dread the experience. I don't have fears going into it other than the standard ""I bet someone finds a bug in 2 seconds"" fear we all have with any software. I don't think much about the third party libs I have used for JSON parsing having used an illegal API call. 

If someone finds a bug I get a crash log from Google and I can generally track it down and fix it as I get a full Java stack dump. The store statistics are acceptable but not eyeball bending.

In the end I end up with a fear and hate of the Apple process and I just find the Android process to be a tool I use at release time.

So as I am getting much more proficient at programming in Obj-C i have noticed that my app design is somewhat.. lacking.

When I look at the designs of those apps that are doing well and compare to mine its.. well.. shit.

Like.. I get the designing in photoshop / illustrator bit (web dev by main trade) but styling an app within is sort of.. difficult like.. it just looks plain ugly.

I was getting into Objective-C about two months ago but then moved across the country to Chicago and just ended up signing up for a coding bootcamp that I ended up not being happy with. So I'm back to learning on my own =[. I am studying for about 7 hours a day but I am still at the beginning of things. I've learned my way around xCode, IB, getting buttons to change text.. a lot of basics. I'm looking to start the Stanford courses also though soon. If anyone wanted to get a study group going where we could work on the Stanford material and talk about iOS topics (especially with iOS7 coming out) I think it would be very beneficial with talking out pain points, reinforcing what is learned, and keeping each other accountable. I'm 24, and I don't have any previous programming experience but I do catch on quickly.

EDIT: [Facebook Group](http://on.fb.me/1bizb2c)
-When you join post a brief summary of your technical skills, where you are at with Objective-C/iOS now, what you're hoping to be able to do by the end, your available hours, your favorite color, etc.

*PS: It's a closed FB group. So you can see the members but not the posts unless you are a member. Whenever I tried to make a private one and I opened the link to it it would come up as non-existent and I want this part not to be the hard part.*

First of all, thanks, this subreddit has been incredibly useful while learning objective-c and ios development. I find reddits like these really help ""take the pulse"" of a new technology.

The app took two of us about a year to learn about and build, during which time we had a brief dalliance with Titanium. I refrain from comment about that, but we did eventually decide to go with native code for both Android and iOS.

It was really fun to have the alien, noobtastic feeling that comes with a totally new platform.

I just wanted to show off what I managed to build and say thanks for helping me figure out how to build it! I can't share any of the source code, but please take a look at the app itself and let me know what you think.

Now, I signed up for an Apple Dev account so I could upload the App and run all the contracts, etc. My programmer got confused and uploaded the game to his account. Now when I log-in to my iTunes Connect account there's a dropdown menu in the top right corner that shows my Apple ID. When I click it, it shows my name and the programmer's name.

We both share Moderator roles, but he has ""legal"" roles. So he controls all the contracts. I know there's a way to ""transfer"" the App to just my Dev account, but I'm not sure how to do this. Can anyone advise? I think the developer and I may be on a ""team"" or something, but even if that's true, shouldn't I be able to request my own contracts?

Basically, I want full control of the game, and all roles. Currently it seems like we're sharing control. How do I change this?

Thanks!

1. Ask CLLocation Manager for an update
2. Once I get an update, tell MyLocation where I am.
3. MyLocation reverse geocodes the location
4. Once the reverse geocode is returned, MyLocation tells my view to display that info.
5. MyLocation then tells my POI class to load POIs from a web api
6. Once the POIs are loaded, my POI class tells my view to display that info. 

It works when everything works, and in a linear fashion. However, as soon as I start handling errors, such as location being turned off, the API being down, etc., the whole train derails. I'm putting in flags left and right, and handling things like the user manually changing the location are a mess.

As I work on the iOS client, however, it raises a lot of questions about a message delivery strategy, and I wanted to see what Reddit's opinions are on the matter.  The no-brainier solution is, obviously, to use Apple's push notification service to deliver the messages.  My server will send a notification with a message identifier, and the app can the retrieve the message using a web service.  This has shortcomings, though.  What if a user does not enable push notifications?  How do I handle the initial pull of messages when the app is launched?  Is APNS reliable enough for this situation?

There are other strategies available. I could poll for messages periodically.  But, at what interval?  Are there at APIs available in its for scheduling this type of thing effectively?  What about other types of ""push"" protocols?

1349865897.0	118vau	Where to start, and how to start?	G-BuLleT	10	3	9	"Hi ladies &amp; gentlemen,
if you don't mind a intro I'd like to start by saying that I'm new to iOS developing and i find it very interesting and feel very good vibes about it, and more importantly a challenge which brings up my interest and that hasn't seen the light of day for quite a long time now. I have a little experience in C++, PHP..., and currently studying Java at Uni. Secondly what I feel should be noted is that I'm a bit low on the budget side and can't/couldn't afford an apple station to work on and my only way of going around this was setting up a dual boot win7/hackintosh, just so anyone who thinks that this is a unethical way of going about it, if felt like that will simply mind their very way past my post.
During and ordinary day at work, while talking to a very special person on msn, and apps topic opened up, and from within that conversation that was spawned an idea for a app was born and contributed to by the both of us.
I myself including the other person feel that this idea hold some ground and should be realized.
Mainly it's a calendar based app.
The user will be asked to enter a certain date, and then a counter should start going about counting the days, and a pop up message should automatically inform the user on the 21-st day, and in that message a youtube video might be included a personal message, a warning, a quote... within the next 7 days the app should inform the user with certain messages that contain informational content of the type of the apps idea several time per day say 3 times in the morning, afternoon, and at night, those messages to be able to include youtube videos, quotes of any sorts, some common sense.
And at the end of every message, before the app goes down to waiting counting the time that till the user should be informed again, to have include links to several sites where a proper topic is opened, of course the topic being related to the base of the apps idea, so that the users can gain more info from each others experiences, providing more support.
Now my question here is how to go about it, from where should I start, and of course if possible a little bit of encouragement and positive thoughts about this given that it will be my very first iOS app - if this isn't asking to much.
I thank everyone that will reply/contribute/help me with this before hand, and let everyone who would like to help out know that this is smth that I'd like to do for the purpose of doing 2 things that I honestly love very much and only have interest for those two, coding/programming/developing and working together with that special someone.
So again, I would like to thank everyone that will contribute and everyone that will even read the title of this. Thank you."	t5_2s61a	True

It only makes sense when reading from a JSON file, an XML file or a pList that you would be able to return dictionary keys in an ordered form.

 NSArray *myDamnArray = [[myDamnDict allKeys] sortedArrayUsingSelector:@selector(caseInsensitiveCompare:)];

Dicts of arrays containing the row NSStrings seem to make the most sense when you want to populate TVC.  Not being to get them in an ordered fashion seems like a CS 101 fundamental that was ignored.

Thankfully, as with his work on singletons, Matt Galloway has one solution to this.  An OrderedNSDictionary class.

It's sad that we have to go hunting for this, but something like this seems to be addressing a significant oversight in Objective C.

From my understanding, I would need the client to sign up for the [iOS Developer Enterprise Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/enterprise/) at a cost of $299 per year.  In addition,  he would need a DUNS number which, since we're not American, would take about a month to get. 

For corporate clients, $299/ year is nothing, but honestly - for small clients, I would feel pretty strange having them charged $300/year for a small app that never passes through an Apple audit or is held in the App store.  

Has anyone had this situation and how did you deal with it? 

--------------------------------
Edit 

Thanks all for the great feedback. The solutions to this seem to be:

1. Develop the app under Apple's [b2b](https://developer.apple.com/programs/volume/b2b/) program.  The client will have to sign up for Apple's Volume Purchase Program which looks to be at no cost. 

2. Do an ad-hoc install and then delete the developer account.  That will prevent the nag screens. Obviously, I won't be deleting my developer account but the idea was how to prevent loose strings tying me to a project.  Here I would probably set the client up with a dev account. 

As pointed out, Apple puts up a number of hoops to jump through so a jquery mobile for UI solution would probably be more efficient.

I have made a scrollable thumbnail grid like the one in the Photo app using the recycle technique discussed in one of the WWDC videos (2010, Designing Apps with Scroll Views). It seems to work perfectly, but I do have one problem:

When I start scrolling, the scroll bar sits on top of the images like it should. But when I get to images that were not visible when the scrolling started (and thus are the once that are recycled), suddenly the images are on top of the scrollbar.

I am unable to test it on a device at the moment, so it is possible that it is a bug in the simulator, but I haven't been able to find anything about it anywhere.

The code is really simple. I have a scroll view where I add ImageViews where needed. The scroll view is inside a navigation controller, but I don't think that is relevant for the problem.

Does anyone have a suggestion?

Thanks


EDIT:

I think I have a solution. Fubarx suggest the following:

*After adding each subview, explicitly toggle the scrollview.showsVerticalScrollIndicator to NO then YES.*

It seems to work great! Thanks to all of you.

I am slowly getting my head around iOS dev and thought a good project for myself would be to pick an old game, and try and reproduce it to an extent, and learn from it.

What I would really appreciate though, is some sort of mentorship where I can gain some insights on good coding practice.  The game I have chosen is an old Commodore 64 game called Jack Attack.  I have chosen this game for a number of reasons - it is relatively straight forward as far as game physics, game play, etc, while still having to do quite a lot of thinking around ""baddie"" logic, physics, tile sets and animation.  I would be happy to post updates of the project somewhere so others could maybe gain some insights from it.

I don't see this as a project I expect to submit to the app store, but more of a learning exercise where I can use the knowledge gained to move forward with more exciting and challenging projects."	t5_2s61a	True

RadicalRaid	8	0	8	"According to [this blogpost](http://akosma.com/2010/05/28/initwithcontentsofurl-methods-considered-harmful/) you should never ever use initWithContentsOfURL in a production environment. I can find myself in some of the points he's making, for example that it might block the UI when you're not using threading and the whole having no control over timeouts or possible errors. But, usually I am using threading when loading stuff via URL and I provide spinners and such to indicate such activities.

I'm afraid my app will not be allowed in the App store because of that one method.

For all that is wrong with initWithContentsOfURL, it does simplify a lot of things. I don't want to manually parse plist files, just for the added error handling. Of course, it would be useful if there were some free available classes that provide such functionality.

So I guess my question is:

Surely this is a problem other iOS developers have encountered - can anyone point me towards a solution?

We run windows desktops and have meeting/collaboration tools that allow us to share screens.

So far, our (bad?) ideas include:

- From windows, VNC to OS X dev box running the iOS simulator and the app, and from Windows share the screen with meeting participants
- Use a video capture card on the Windows system, connect it to an iOS device via the A/V out cables for the device, and share the screen with meeting participants

I'm new to iOS development, my background is in web programming but I'm attempting to learn something new and iOS dev seemed like a good idea.

I'm attempting to do the Standard table view / listing with a tab bar for changing views and a navigation controller for going backwards / forwards within that tab.  I put together the layout using Interface Builder, using a UIView as the main holder, and then I dropped in the other elements. If I run that interface through the simulator it works perfectly fine, but as soon as I build and run my application within Xcode the table view takes over the entire view, apart from the tab bar at the bottom.

For development reasons, I made the background colours bright and easily distinguishable, but they didn't appear in the actual application, here's a screenshot which shows the view in Interface Builder and the application running in iPhone Simulator - http://i.imgur.com/i3Zl8.png
As you can see, they look entirely different and I don't really understand why.

The data in the table is pulled in via JSON, I used [this tutorial](http://iphone.zcentric.com/2008/08/05/first-json-iphone-application/) as a basis for doing that. Taking out all of that code still makes the table take up all the view.

I tried adding the navigation bar programatically, but it just attached itself to the table and scrolled with the table, something which was obviously not acceptable.

My datastore has some initial logic that does the whole ""Look for the database and if it's not there copy the default file"" thing.

I'll repeat - this works.  App's been out for months.  No problem.

Now I'm doing an update, and I'd like to seize the opportunity to update the database.  Not changing the schema, just adding rows (going from 1000 to 2000).  So I include the newer sqlite file, and I change the logic from ""If the database doesn't already exist, copy the default file"" to ""Overwrite the existing database with the default file.""  I'm safe, this is a readonly database, the user will not have changed it.

This seems to work for the simulator.  I fire it up and I see my 2000 rows.

But when I build to my device, I always see the old number of rows.  I am deliberately not uninstalling the app - I'm trying to simulate what will happen when my existing userbase downloads the new update to the app.  

Any ideas?  Is there something in the device that makes its own persistent version of what happens in CoreData, so that simply updating the sqlite file that is came from is no longer sufficient once it exists?

UPDATE - I think I may have found the problem.  The ""copyItemAtPath"" function does not have an overwrite mode, so when I switched from ""If file doesn't exist then copy default to that space"" to ""just copy default into that space"", I'd been throwing a ""file exists"" error, and no file copy was happening.  I switched around the logic to do ""If X exists then move it to temp, then copy default to X, then if X exists (successful copy), go ahead and delete the temp copy.""  This fixed the problems that I was seeing, and I've got it with my testers now.  Thanks for all the help!

1347552518.0	ztsv0	I want to use iCloud via Core Data but I don't know if I should. Help!	tharris0101	8	4	12	"I have an songwriting app [Songsmith](http://loneyeti.com/songsmith) that is iPhone only and works great. I want to make it into a universal app that works on iPad as well. Sharing the app's data through iCloud seemed to be a no-brainer, but now I'm second guessing everything.

My app is currently SQLite backended, but I have a Core Data version (that would convert existing user's SQLite data to Core Data so they don't lose any data) that I've tested and seems stable and ready to go. There is no point in switching to CD unless I do iCloud, though so I haven't pushed this update to the App Store yet.

In learning Core Data over iCloud, several opinions from other developers keep getting repeated:

* Core Data over iCloud works fine in an optimal situation but things like turning iCloud off and on, a device that stops syncing for a while, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, having the user delete app data can all really muck things up and cause data loss or errors while syncing. There does not seem to be a great solution for some of these issues

* Its nearly impossible to foresee and plan for everything a user might do that could corrupt his/her database or break future syncs. At some point data loss is likely for at least a very small percentage of users

* iCloud takes a lot of time to code and especially test. That time could be better spent adding other features to the app or making new apps (I'm not as concerned about this, I've just seen it come up multiple times)

* Finally: Core Data over iCloud is just not ready for production yet and should be avoided

Please give me your opinions on these. Has anyone successfully used Core Data over iCloud in a production app and are happy with the results? It would be a GREAT feature for my app but stability and protection of data are very high priority for me.

**tl;dr**
I have an app that iCloud using Core Data would be perfect for, but horror stories on the internet have me worried. Should I use it?

My app will need to list books that users have added to a database. Each book has data like its author, isbn, genre etc that I have parsed from a json search through google books. Adding books is done through the app by a barcode scanner I have already integrated.


Right now I have the mechanics of adding and viewing the books complete through a local coredata setup, but I am interested in knowing what I need to read up on to get it working by pulling and adding to my own web database.


From poking around stackoverflow I see lots of talk on ruby on rails, sqlite, php, webservices etc but that's all a bit foreign to me and I'm having trouble filtering it down to just what I need to focus on. I have a test box that I can use to setup whatever database server I need, but with all the options available, I don't know where to start.


I am thinking it goes along the lines of..
sqlite database on server that my app communicates to through REST. The main listing of books I need to populate my tableview is somehow downloaded from the server and saved locally into coredata. the tableview uses coredata to populate the table. when a user needs to add a book to the remote database, the book object is sent to the remote database where it is added.

If I am going about this the wrong way (which is likely), let me know. I am mainly interested in what I need to do read up on to get my app talking with some form of remote server."	t5_2s61a	True

I don't mind having the lower eCPM i'm getting now, but what I would like at the very least is some consistency like I get with adMob.  AdMob will consistently have (at least for the past 6 months) a 95% fill rate with an abysmal eCPM.  This is my iAd data from the past 30 days.  It's like riding a revenue roller coaster - i can never predict what my monthly take is going to be since it varies so wildly from month-to-month.

Not sure whether this is the right subreddit for this request, if it isn't, please advise me and apologies in advance. I work for a well-known international education resource that you will have heard of, but I cannot identify (this is a speculative inquiry for the present). This body has an amazing archive of (free) educational material that would be incredibly useful for anyone trying to get into a particular field, but mostly it sits online unread by many of those that would benefit. At a recent meeting I mooted the idea of an app that could push interested parties towards the right material, alert them when new material was published online and offer personalized tips and training opportunities to those signing up. The idea was met with some enthusiasm by our directors, but it was quickly squashed by our IT department for money/resource reasons. My questions are: in theory, how difficult would it be to develop the appropriate app? What are we talking about money-wise? And would it make a difference cost-wise if the app set out to further education for the public good rather than make a profit?

I guess my question is what are generally considered the best systems to use to ensure that it can meet demand in case it sees some user growth, without slowing down? Would [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/iphone-application-hosting/) be the way to go as far as hosting goes or is there a more preferred service to go with?

As far as the server software/language/database I'm assuming Apache/PHP/MySQL will be fine to use or will any one of those not scale well? I'm fairly confident PHP will work fine since most requests will just be a quick script that will check authentication and either pop a little data or write a little data out/to the database and exit. I'm mainly worried about the web server and database choice; I have experience with PHP/ASP.NET and MySQL/MSSQL (running on a mix of IIS and Apache) but it has been used for internal company applications with a comparably limited number of users so there was never any issues with speed. If I had to do it now I'd probably go Apache/PHP/MySQL, and sure it would work extremely well in the beginning, but I don't want to end up kicking myself later, and would rather go the ""right"" or ""standard"" route from the beginning.

What would you all recommend?

Oh also, I'm kind of just tacking this question on to this post since it's somewhat related, but besides the back end setup one of the only other parts of this project that is really intimidating me is user authentication for the API (is there a way to authenticate based off the user's device ID or phone number or does an account with my service need to be created?).

* To identify an unaddressed niche.
* To get notified when infringing apps enter the App Store.

Thanks for taking the time to read my post.  I'll try to keep this brief.  As a disclaimer, this has been crossposted to try to get comprehensive feedback on the situation.



The TL;DR of this would be that I'm considering purchasing and expanding a task manager/to-do list app.  Go ahead, get the eyeroll out of the way.  Just keep in mind that I am still considering it.  I would say I am currently in the market verification and cost/benefit analysis step.



The app as it exists is fully functional and has had a couple hundred downloads.  The design and UI are attractive and intuitive even though the font could use some love.






Here are the current features...

""Lite""  (The ""Pro"" version simply removes the limit on the number of tasks you can add)

**1. Add New Tasks**

You can add your new tasks in a daily, weekly or monthly format.
You can save the task to your iPhone calendar app, too.
 
**2. Check the Done Tasks**

Can't remember if you finished your task? Just check it!
 
**3. Calendar View**

You can view your tasks in a calendar viewmode.
 
**4. Alarm**

You can set your alarm to every tasks.






First and foremost, I understand that this is a very simple app.  I would combine the ""Lite"" and ""Pro"" versions into one app.  The asking price is about $1,500, which initially strikes me as high for such limited functionality, but I understand that it is basically a finished product from an aesthetic standpoint.  I'm viewing this as a solid foundation to build on.



Some features I would like to add include prioritization of tasks and automatic arrangement of high priority tasks over lower priority tasks by day, week, month.  I would also like to include the option to mark a task as done and take a picture of the finished product, then share that on social media with a caption.  There are other ideas, but those two should be a good start.



So, the big question here is...what is the value in this?  I'm not trying to get rich, but I don't want an expensive, ""fun"" project that leaves me with nothing in the end.  If I wanted that, I would spend $1,500 on playing golf.  Is this app overpriced (my gut instinct is yes)?  Could I pay a developer and designer less or a similar amount to build a comparable app from the ground up (my gut instinct is no)?  What would be a ballpark estimate for incorporating the two new features listed above?



I'm sure I will have follow-on questions, which I will include in the form of edits.  Thanks in advance for any help!

1364278521.0	1b10pn	Quick Question for Beginners (recap)	Optronx	9	3	9	"Hey guys,

I've been browsing this subreddit for little bit and was wondering if anyone had anything else to add to what I've found. The only experience I have in programming is a week or two of self taught basic HTML. Other than that, I have ZERO programming experience.

I've found a couple similarities and wanted to know if anyone else had anything to add to help me (and others) start a proper track to learning how to create apps for iOS devices. I DO NOT want to program games. I would like to create productivity apps and/or other apps you would use to simplify daily life (i.e., simplifying complex activities). 

Where to Start:

1) Standford Programming Class on iTunes (https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/ipad-iphone-application-development/id473757255)

The only question I have about this is for someone that has zero experience, it seems very difficult. Also, they state that as a prereq, you should have knowledge of the C language. 

2. Books by Jeff LaMarche (https://www.apress.com/index.php/author/author/view/id/1812)


So far, this is all I have. I know it's not much, but it's something. I love computers and am very interested in dedicating all of my free time to making this happen. I've wanted to learn how to code for years and have never had the opportunity until now. So here are some questions I have for you guys:

1. Where do I start? 

Is this a decent track to follow or should I start somewhere else? A couple friends have suggested learning Python, but if that has no crossover into iOS app development, I don't really see a point.

2. How do I see a visual of what I'm developing?

By this I mean, is there an application that I code in that shows me what I'm doing in real time or do I code, save, put into my iOS device and see how it works? (Please don't be rude in answering this question. I know it's stupid and probably sounds ridiculous, but please remember that I'm a completely noob)

3. What was the track that you took to get to the point that you're at in you iOS development career? 


Thanks for all the help guys. I know that no matter what questions I have, Reddit always has my back. Thanks!

I am involved with a small tech company named Tau Cygnus that is close to releasing its first product, Cyborg. At the most basic level, Cyborg is an iPod dock that you can control with your smartphone (Android or iOS) via a free app that we will be making available at launch. I am developing the iOS counterpart, while the other guys have been in charge of the Android app and developing the dock itself. The dock is fully functional at this point (still fine-tuning some things here and there)  and we are nearing the beta testing phase of the app.

We recently launched an [Indiegogo campaign located here](http://www.indiegogo.com/cyborgdock/x/1841316), which goes into greater detail regarding our progress and Cyborg’s capabilities. Oh, and we will be making the software development kit open source so that you can create your own apps that interact with the dock in any unique fashion that you come up with!

This product has been in development for quite some time and I'm thrilled to be this close to production.

I am a long time apple user and will be finishing up my BS in electrical engineering this spring. I am currently working on a project for a design class and have some questions regarding Bluetooth Low Energy and how it is implemented in iOS (both 5 and 6).

First a bit of background about the project. We are designing a occupancy detection system for a building. The plan is to have BLE modules attached to walwarts throughout the entire building. These devices would communicate with a users smartphone and provide location information to a backend system. We want this system to require very little user interaction. Essentially they would download the app, enable BLE, and then forget about the app. At least at first. We plan to add further functionality to the app later.

I have done a bit of research and it sounds like all BLE control will be done via an app. I plan to build off of [TI's demo app](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Category:IPhone4SBLEDemo). 

My first questions is regarding how backgrounding works with BLE. I understand that there are two different backgrounding methods, explained [here](http://lists.apple.com/archives/bluetooth-dev/2011/Dec/msg00012.html). It sounds like we would want to use session backgrounding, to minimize user interaction as much as possible. But my question is does the backgrounding stay enabled indefinitely? 

Backgrounding Questions

1) Event or session backgrounding?

2) Does the backgrounding stay enabled indefinitely?

3) What happens when the phone is reset? Or if a restore is done (assuming the user backed up their apps)?

4) Can other apps disable the BLE functionality?

My next category of questions involves the central and peripheral roles. Our main goal is to limit power usage on the smartphone so that users will not be tempted to disable bluetooth. I believe this should be possible with either mode. 

Central or Peripheral

1) Do you see any benefits to having the iOS device being one over the other? 

2) Would it be better to have the iPhone send out an advertisement periodically or the BLE walwart device? 

Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"	t5_2s61a	True

Question is, I receive a request in plain text, so do I do splits and make NSArrays out of everything? Do I have to manually create my objects from a request formatted as a NSString?

Any help on this would be appreciated.

Anyways... I've been following along using the ""Beginning iPhone 4 Development: Exploring the iOS SDK"" book from Apress. It's a good book (I have C++ and Java experience) but there's one example in the book that I'm toying with and I can't get it to work for the life of me. It compiles but bails at run time before even running the nib, it appears. 

Here's what it's supposed to do: As an example of having a different layout for portrait and landscape modes, they have you create two views in your nib, and then use your view controller to swap between them upon rotation (with a nice little animation).

It's showing the line of code that gives the problem being here:

self.window.rootViewController = self.viewController;

that line is in - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
which is in my AppDelegate .m file...

Could anyone explain the level of complexity behind my app, would it be fairly simple? Quite difficult?

These guest users will be prompted to log in to their Facebook accounts and make a post on their walls. After the post, I want my app to erase their token cache / forget their credentials.

Unfortunately, it seems that the Facebook SDK doesn't easily allow this. I've looked at the Switch User Sample demo app and, while close, it isn't exactly what I'm looking to do. In the app, you can add up to three guest users and have the app 'forget' them by clearing the slot, but it turns out that the user's information is not truly forgotten. If you click on an empty slot after forgetting a user, the web view dialog is skipped altogether and the former user is automatically added with no prompts.

Has anyone run into a similar issue? If so, do you know how to actually make your app delete the user cache/information and force the web view login prompt to show? 

**Update:**

Some further weirdness:

I thought that perhaps Safari was caching the Facebook cookies and that was why the user wasn't being prompted for a login. To test this theory, I deleted my app and rebuilt &amp; ran it. The first run through it worked perfectly, with the user being prompted for their Facebook email/password in the web view.  The next run through, same issue. So this leads me to believe that something about the Facebook session is being stored in the App sandbox. 

Next I tried resetting NSUserDefaults before attempting a Facebook login. This had no effect, with the first attempting working and all subsequent attempts not asking for the user's login information. 

What else is going on here? Is the Facebook SDK storing the user information somewhere else? How do I go about actually closing their session and deleting all local data? 

**Update 2**

After about 10 hours of trying to find a fix for this, I finally came upon the solution.  

After I attempt to log the user out, I clear the Safari cookies using the following code:

    NSHTTPCookie *cookie;
    NSHTTPCookieStorage *storage = [NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage];
    for (cookie in [storage cookies]) {
        [storage deleteCookie:cookie];
    }
    [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] synchronize];

When I go through creating a new FBSession and opening it, the user is automatically prompted for the credentials again.  "	t5_2s61a	True

1359324937.0	17e2gj	Challenge: How would you go about looking for an Open Source POS with REST API for ecommerce app?	jlmitch5	5	1	4	"Hey everyone,
I'll start off by saying I'm very new to Objective-C and iOS development.  I was reading my development book while at my retail job, and it got me thinking about what I'd want to make in an app for the store.

I was wondering if you all know of an open source POS that has a functional API to grab stocking information for an ecommerce-based iPhone app.  By this, I mean a smart system that would allow the app to auto-populate the store's stock, and automatically add it as items for sale in the app.  Also pulling info like if an item would have to be special ordered and couldn't be delivered directly by the store at time-of-purchase, if it's sold out.

The reason I mentioned REST is because while googling for a solution, the only system I could find that would have those APIs would be [LightSpeed](http://www.lightspeedretail.com/developer-api/), and that's most definitely not open source.  Would there be another way to directly access databasing not using an API in a POS system to do what I'm asking?

I will note that this isn't a project I'm intending on taking on right now, so much as a chance for me to get some direction into ways you seasoned devs access data from systems where that data might not be so simply accessible.  Kind of frustrated that my googling skills aren't really getting me the info I need (as various ways I've tried to search [open source + POS + iOS + development + API] are not going to anything development related, rather already created POS systems that can be accessed on iOS devices).

So yeah, this question is more methodology-based rather than implementation-based.  I'm interested in knowing *how* the hell you guys find the stuff you use for development, as I'm finding that a lot more difficult to wrap my head around, because I feel like the more I get into my CS degree, the more I realize that we're learning how programming works, not how a programmer works.

The first way is using UIImagePickerController with SourceTypeCamera.  Using this method, the user clicks a button to load the camera view, clicks to take a picture, and then clicks Use (or Retake).  The image is then queued up to upload and is also saved into the device's image gallery for later use.

The user also has the option to load up a gallery picker, and select multiple images that they have previously taken either in the app, or with another application (such as the standard Camera app.)

So here is my question: Is there a better way to take multiple images in my app without the user needing to click the Use button each time (for a total of 3 clicks per picture.)  Ideally, I would like it to work similar to the built in camera app, where you can load the camera interface once, and then just click the picture button and take as many pictures as you want in a row.  Maybe there is a setting to allow you to do this, but I haven't been able to find it, and in my search found other people who were asking for similar functionality.  I have found people who recommend streaming the video from the camera to the screen and basically taking a screen grab of the video, but they say this will obviously produce lower quality images, which sadly won't work in my situation.

Alternatively, if I can't get the ImagePicker to take multiple images similar to the built-in Camera app, would it be possible to just launch the Camera app itself by clicking a button within my application?  As this app is an internal app only, if needed, the solution wouldn't even need to be app-store approvable.  Most of the working solutions I've seen for this seem to require a jail-broken phone to be able to launch applications from within other apps if the app to be launched doesn't accept URLs.

So, any iOS devs with more experience know of a good solution for this issue?

- I start a Windows based project and then add two view controllers (one for each view) and two views.

- I start a View based project, then add a second view controller and a second view.

So I have three questions:

1. Can a view controller control more than one view? My guess is, probably not, but I want to be sure.
2. Does UIWebView always need its own view controller?
3. Which one of these is a better choice?

It does some nifty stuff with Parse in the backend and automatically downloads new recipes every time I add them to the database

I wanted to outline some of the things that I learned building this app.

1. Third Party API's and libraries are awesome. Beginners shouldn't be afraid to search around for them and start implementing them. This project used Google's XML Parser, FlatUIKit, Parse as a backend, and Socialize for sharing and commenting features
2. Reading other people's code helps you learn to write better code. Some of my favorite stuff was Apple's simple examples on their developer site.
3. Learn by doing. Following along with tutorials from RayWenderlich.com or YouTube makes a huge difference

For example if I have an

And I can do similar things for NSData.  But I would really like to have something more general.

I have looked into, with no luck: 

* Zones, which seem like they are no longer used.
* Creating a parent class of NSObject and casting everything to that and keeping track of the memory regions.  This has just been a complete pain though.
* Encrypting the actual contents of the data and forcing a decrypt on access.  This gets back to the problem of knowing something about every single type.
* Encrypting then decrypting memory regions, can't find a way to reliably know where in memory a general object is.

So I have recently got into iOS programming, and more specifically, games programming using Cocos2d.

I was just having a look at some of the cross platform frameworks - such as Monogame/Corona SDK/Cocos 2d-x etc and wondered what people thought of them (both for apps, and for games).

I'm just a bit dubious about the whole ""develop for one platform, publish to them all"" kind of tagline.

Those people that are using an ""all in one"" for cross platform, is it actually that easy?  Is it a case of building all of the under the hood stuff x-platform and then building a separate UI for each?

I'm just wondering if now that I have the basics down, I should jump ship to a cross platform framework, or stick with Cocos2d for now and port my games later if I want to do it.

I'm working on games mainly, and would love to release for both iOS and Android if it's not a massive headache.

    Just a couple of quick questions.

I'm getting waaay ahead of myself here, but want to avoid any hiccups down the line.

I've signed up for the iOS dev programme recently, and intend to release some apps/games in the future (obviously).  It's more of a hobby than a business plan, but who knows, I might get some sales at some point.

I've signed up for a sole developer account.  However, I'd probably want to brand all of my apps under a software company type name at some point.

Couple of questions on that front:  

1. If I intend to publish my apps under ""My Software Company"" at some point, do I need to start developing them with a certificate signed under that name from day 1?  Or can I worry about that later if I actually ever get a fully functioning app up and running?

2. If I were to publish a game from my sole dev account, can I later upgrade to a corporate account and switch the app to the new brand?

It would be a shame to write a game/app that made some sales, and then set up the software brand but not be able to have all your apps under the ""others from this developer"" type link in the app store."	t5_2s61a	True

Flash forward a couple of years.  While surfing Reddit I stumbled across a post mentioning MonoTouch... apparently it's still alive.  Doing a little more poking I discovered that Apple had since relaxed its rules regarding 3rd-party IDEs.

Unfortunately, a typical 2-pass blur didn't prove practical in my mobile (Android) tests, so I ended up taking a different route. 

I figured my technique might also be useful for some iOS devs.

Basically, it involves blurring each mipmap level, then picking between them using the optional *bias* parameter of texture2D() in a fragment shader. This way we can increase/decrease the blur strength simply by sending a float uniform to the fragment shader; and otherwise everything renders as per usual (no extra draw passes or FBOs).

I describe the technique in brief [here](https://github.com/mattdesl/lwjgl-basics/wiki/Lerp-Blur-Brief). I include more discussion and code [here](https://github.com/mattdesl/lwjgl-basics/wiki/OpenGL-ES-Blurs). It's in Java, but it shouldn't be too difficult to port to other platforms.

I gather the relevant information using averagePowerForChannel: in combination with NSTimer, checking the volume of the sound file at an interval. So, I am now capable of determining the average volume of a sound file.

However...

I have come to the discovery that, regardless of the value I input at setVolume, a specific sound file will always return the exact same average volume. So, it simply looks at the file, not taking into account any changes to audible volume caused by the value which I input at setVolume.

You can enter a value between 0 and 1 at setValue. However, how does this value effect the volume? I need to know this so I can make an accurate volume comparison.

I hope somebody can provide some answers || point me in the right direction. I checked the class reference, but it was no help There's a similar question on Stackoverflow, but no definite answer.

If this is not the right place for this question, please inform me where I'd perhaps have more luck.

I don't see this kind of thing done in mobile games too often and I think it would be really cool to allow a 3d option that can be turned on in one of mine. 

I know it's pretty gimmicky and probably only fun for about 2 min (depending on the game) but people love that kind of stuff and it may help with getting noticed in the app store.

Rombusrk	3	0	2	"I'm working on an app that will need to store a text description and some small attributes for each day of a month for about ~500 individual ""lines"" of data. The ~500 lines currently reside in their own CoreData entity and I'm trying to decide what would be better: 

1. Generate and store the month of data as an array then encapsulate and store that as another attribute of the current entity. 

2. Create a new Core Data entity and store the resulting month of data (28-31 individual ""days"" per ""Line"") with a relationship between each ""day"" and the corresponding line.

I'm not too worried about the creation/storing performance since there's a rather good chance that will happen on a server. My major concern is usage performance because I'll need to be working with this ""days"" data while displaying my ~500 lines in a UITableView. I'm also trying to keep the size of my CoreData store itself as low as possible. I cant see a need to do any sort of pulling/sorting on the ""days"" entity, just need to be able to pull those days via relationship.

1343911061.0	xk6b9	Convoluted question about using an iOS application for Crime Scene field work	Noromaru	3	0	10	"The problem:
I currently work as a Crime Scene Specialist (field work for crime scenes) in a major city in the US. Due to accreditation requirements, our department is exploring alternative methods of retaining field notes in order to make those notes available in the case file.

Currently the notes are transcribed from handwritten notes taken on a notepad in the field into a Word document that's saved into LIMS (our Laboratory Information Management System). The new requirements say that we must keep our field notes as they are. This means that any handwritten notes must be scanned into the case notes in LIMS as they are taken. Of course, the notes must be legible, but they also must reflect the final report written in LIMS.

The problems that we're facing is that any corrections that come up (misspelled words, incorrect names, dates of birth, etc.) for handwritten notes would require that the notes page be printed out, corrected by hand, and scanned back into the system. We also see problems with the legibility of handwritten notes taken at a scene that may last several hours. Due to this, our management is interested in an electronic method of taking notes in the field that's time efficient, less cumbersome than a clipboard that would have to be carried around while photographing, and able to be edited in the case of corrections.

In an ideal world:
We would like to have a module-style form to input information. The way we would like that to work is to start with the basic information (case number, location, date and times, offense type, etc.) and be able to add other information. Other types of information would be things such as vehicle, detective, subject, processing types, general observations, and evidence information. Once the scene is departed, ideally the information would be generated into a document containing only the added modules. Again, said document would ideally be an editable format for further corrections.

I realize that this could be incredibly complicated, and would be extremely difficult (impossible?) to implement. Again, due to the fact that we're constantly photographing and collecting evidence, the physical limitations means that an iPad wouldn't be very plausible either. An iPod touch would likely be the ideal device in terms of being able to carry the device on our person to be able to add any new details that come up.

SO, my main question is how difficult this would be to create. Would it even be possible? Are there other options that may work better for the application (Android, for example)? Is it even something worth pursuing, or would it just cause more problems than it would solve?

Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated."	t5_2s61a	True

 Currently, I'm coding it so onApplicationDidFinishLaunching: loads all the items as objects in an array. I'm worried that this isn't the best way of doing it.

&gt; In your app delegate instead of:
&gt; 
&gt;       [self.window addSubview:navController.view]; 
&gt; 
&gt; Use:
&gt; 
&gt;       [self.window setRootViewController:navController];

People are going to read your website, product descriptions, and any other words you put in front of them. If the writing isn't good, they won't buy, or subscribe, or do anything other than click the back button. I can help.

**I will write the product descriptions, website copy, and other marketing materials for your project. For free.**

It's not entirely out of the kindness of my heart; what I really need are portfolio pieces. Copywriting is a cutthroat world, and no one is willing to give me a chance unless I've got a book bursting with work. But if you and I work together, we both win: you get professional-grade language for your product, and I get another project with which to woo a potential employer.

Someone noted to me previously that this arrangement may negatively impact copywriters by devaluing their work, which is something I am loathe to do. To prevent this, I have sworn only to use my powers for good, and to assist with those projects that cannot afford to hire a copywriter. If you have the need and resources to engage the services of a professional copywriter, this offer is not for you (although you are perfectly free to hire me).

And a final caveat: your project must be live, or very nearly going to be (no speculative planning phases, please).

There it is. I'll write your copy, free of charge, and we'll all come out of this with smiles and mutual expressions of esteem.

If I can, I would like to transition into contract work slowly, keeping my existing job (I am a Business Systems Analyst by day). Ideally, I would like to start by taking on 10-15 hours of work per week at an hourly rate of $30-40. I will have some constraints around my availability - which I would make clear to any client - but I have been putting in around 20 hours per week into my own iOS projects for the last couple of years without it impacting my 9-5.

I am borderline desperate to make this career move. I enjoy my current job very much, but I spend my weekends in xCode, wishing that work on Monday was more of the same. I'm not naive enough to expect the same satisfaction if and when I am working for someone else, but I'm confident it would be a good fit for me. I would also like to earn a little more money a couple of years from now, doing something I love.
Despite this, it is not feasible for me to simply quit my job and take a punt. I need to prove to myself and my partner that I can make a go of this without bankrupting us in the process. We both also rely on my employment for health insurance.

Ideally, I would like to start working with some kind of trial period in place. If the client thinks I'm not up to the task, s/he can find someone else. Similarly, if I determine that the project is too advanced for me, I can comfortably let the client know that I am not skilled enough to complete it (and re-assess my next steps). I suppose the benefit here cuts both ways - neither of us has to commit sight-unseen to a long term contract, at least not at first.

Once I have delivered a couple of projects, and know that I can make a success of development, I would line up something more substantial and commit full time.

Is this a workable plan? Am I likely to find anyone looking for this? If so, how and where? Or am I being unrealistic"	t5_2s61a	True

First post in this subreddit - hopefully I'm not breaking any rules. I can see through the forum and personal experience working at some major game and app studios that monetization and advertising have been an extremely bad experience for the most part. 

microGiving is our new technology which places a donation button inside your app or web properties so your fans can donate to a charity of their choice. Any time a donation is made, we give you (the developer) $1 USD. Our recent tests have shown that users are 3x more likely to make a donation than make an ""in app purchase"" and we've seen our platform monetize at a much higher rate than major ad networks: about $10 per 1,000 active users a day is not uncommon amongst our partners. We've partnered with the American Red Cross and Child's Play as our premier donation partners for our beta program.

Basically, I have form field information that is generated by the server and then passed to my iOS client where fields are laid out in a table.  For most text entry fields, the UITextField view works perfectly.  The problem comes in if the user needs to type in more text than space allows.  I played around a little with adding a UITextView into the tablerow instead of a field, but it behaves a little differently and really I'm just not sold on it. 

I've thought about opening another screen with a TextView and then displaying the text in a label of the table.  This should work fine as other fields (such as a list selector) also load a separate screen for data entry.  Is this the ideal way to handle it, or is there another preferred method?

Using Storyboards, I have a UIViewController that has two UITableViews placed on it.  Each of these tables has a different custom class that is handling drag and drop operations between the them.  At the moment, I'm just using an NSArray in each tableview as a datasource for testing.  Now the drag and drop between the tables is working I need to get the proper datasource for each table working.

When the ViewController is segued to from the previous controller it passes the Managed Object Context plus some other objects.  What I want to do is the pass these objects on to each of the UITableView custom classes.  But I can't get it working.  When I'm debugging the UITableView classes seem to be executed first, so trying to pass objects from the controller's ViewDidLoad etc doesn't work.  I can't figure out where to pass these objects so that the tableviews use them when they load.

I also tried passing them in the previous controllers PrepareForSegue method, e.g. 'destinationController.UITableView.object1 = self.object1' but this doesn't work either.

        [buttonOne setTitle: @""Original Title""];
        [buttonOne addTarget: nil action: @selector(buttonOnePressed:) forControlEvents: UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
        // add button to view and layout along with other controls

        SubView *subView = [SubView new];
        [self addSubView: subView]; // Add subview in
        // Layout subview in respect to main view
    }

MainViewController.m

    - (void)loadView
    {
        [self setView: [MainView new]];
    }
    
    - (void)buttonOnePressed: (UIButton *) sender
    {
        [sender setTitle: @""New Title""];
    }

The SubView.h and SubView.m files are created similarly and the MainViewController implements the MainViewDelegate protocol (that is a composite of its subviews protocols).

Here are my thoughts and reasoning's.
The MainViewDelegate is a composite of its immediate subviews delegates (and those in turn should be composites of THEIR immediate subviews delegates). This creates a composite protocol hierarchy that allows the view controller to only reference the top most protocol directly without having to list all the subview protocols.

By setting all controls targets to ""nil"" I can remove the need to have a custom initWithDelegate method (that the developer might forget to use) as the event will now go up the responder chain and get picked up by the MainViewController that should have implemented the delegate protocol. There might be a performance hit by letting the event bubble up the responder chain versus setting the target to a delegate property. I'm not sure how to test that. I may be over thinking the initWithDelegate though. If I have the controls targets set to use the delegate property, but the ViewContoller doesn't instantiate the class using initWithDelegate, the delegate property will be nil and the event will bubble up the chain anyway. It will ""just work"". At this point, I still think that the initWithDelegate isn't ""required"" and reduces code in the MainView and SubViews by not having to implement it.

I created the view objects in init as that should be called no matter which constructor the developer uses.

I set the action method for the button to use UIButton as the ViewController should be aware of what type of control called and removes the requirement for casting in the case that it will be modifying it.

The one thing I have not figured out the best way for is for modifying controls that didn't initiate the action, like labels for example. Should I create them as public properties in the view and reference them in the ViewController as self.view.myLabel.text = @""Blah""; or use an initWithDelegate method to wire up the views controls with weakly referenced properties on the ViewController similar to how IB works (I think) and reference them as self.myLabel.text = @""Blah""? I'm leaning towards using initWithDelegate now as subviews will need someway to wire up with the ViewController. So, in the ViewDelegate protocols, I can list the UIControl properties that the ViewController should implement, and then the views handle the wireup in their initWithDelegate methods.

i've got an idea for an app (hasn't everyone!!) and i checked the store and nothing exists which is similar to what i'm trying to make. w00t! so i'm going to fumble my way through making an app and try to teach myself the basics at the same time (learn by doing!!)

the app is very simple - the main function is to listen to a 20ish minute speech (think of it as a workout video, but audio only). 

here's what i'd love to get some help with:

1. i want the app to have 4 pages, each swiping in a different direction like this:

http://i.imgur.com/rrir0zq.png

i have the swipes working in xcode, but the animation transitions are default and always swipe right (up actually, since my app only works in landscape). so how can i make the transition match the swipe - the swipe pulls the page in the direction that it's being swiped (much like iOS 7)

2. ~~for the audio workout, i will put that on its own page. is there a set of default audio controllers bundled with xcode? i couldn't find any. the audio needs only be a simple start, pause, search forward/back. it's just one track, so there's no library or other tracks.~~

i've installed the audio packages for xcode and added the controls to the page. the ctl+drag linking isn't working, but i'll figure that out!

3. the 'other' page might be a random quotes page. what's the best way to store something like quotes and pull them randomly (such as a database). i thought of putting it online to make the app smaller, but without access to 3G or wifi the quotes wouldn't work. so i guess it's best to store them inside the app.

Consider the following method declaration:

    -(void)insertObject:(id)anObject atIndex:(NSUInteger)index;

According to Apple's documentation, **insertObject** and **index** are both *method signature keywords*, while **anObject** and **index** are *parameters*.

So **atIndex** is not actually a parameter/argument, but part of the method name. Objective-C doesn't use named parameters, but parameters interleaved with the method name. Got it.


On the other hand...


According to the Big Nerd Ranch iOS book, **atIndex** is a *selector label*, and the term *method signature keyword* is not used at all.

And according to Kochan's well-regarded book, **atIndex** is an *argument* - which seems wrong, because if atIndex is an argument/parameter, then what would that make **index**??


So, out in the real world, what terminology is actually preferred?

I'm still not a fan, and frequently run into simple cases where I try to get something working in the storyboard for 1/2 an hour and end up making it work in code in 5 minutes.  Bearing in mind that it is certainly still possible to screw up in the storyboard real easily, it appears that /u/NSFlux has mastered many advanced concepts in the storyboard that really should be seen by the rest of this subreddit.  Since he took the time to distill his knowledge and type it up, it would be remiss of me if I did not present it here for the rest of you to see.  

I've taken some time to make links more visible and proofed the text for your listening pleasure.

What follows is /u/NSFlux's highly informative post.  All credit belongs to him on this:

----------------------------------

I've actually been meaning to do a video on these techniques but at the same time I've been working on a massive rewrite of our app so my time has been very limited.  That and I discovered I suck at video editing.

First of all you have to understand what a storyboard is.  A storyboard is not just a single file that contains all the screens in your app.  I think this is what turns most people off of storyboards is that their app gets to cumbersome in this single storyboard approach.  Interface builder gets slow, endless streams of merge conflicts, etc etc.  So they give up and go back to using nibs. 

Others shun nibs as well as storyboards and just write it all by hand.  I think this is also a bad idea.  Everybody writes code differently, and has their own idea of how ""it should be done"" but generally when building UI's in interface builder, most of the implementation details are pretty obvious, and it keeps a bunch of unnecessary UI drawing code out of your app, and in a pace where it's easy to quickly get a good idea of what your app looks like.

I'll give you some tips below on some general storyboarding guidelines, then I'll provide a handy little class that can facilitate following those guidelines easily.  I'll include link to a demo project as well.


**1: A storyboard per user story**

A rule thumb I usually follow is that I have one storyboard per user story.  In iOS apps, especially on iPhone, a user story can take up multiple screens.  If you have more than say 10 or so screens in your storyboard, your story is probably too big and needs to be broken down further.  All a storyboard is, is a collection of NIBs stored in a single file.  This gives us some benefits such as being able to do a rough story implementation quickly to gauge how the screen flow is going to work, as well as see how all the screens relate to each other.  It also provides a nice encapsulation of a series of related screens.  So now the question is, how do we related storyboards together when we want to flow from one user story to another.  I'll get to that in a bit, but in a nutshell the ""leaf nodes"" of the storyboard usually will launch other storyboards or UI flows, or if you use my storyboard swizzle trick below the leaf nodes are actually the first scene of another storyboard.


**2: Merging storyboards isn't really that bad**

Storyboards are just XML files, and most diff tools can handle them just fine.  If you follow my first suggestion though, you generally won't have more than one developer working on a single storyboard at any given time.  Occasionally you might, if maybe another developer had to fix a bug.  If you do find multiple developers frequently bumping into each other in a storyboard, again, you probably have not properly broken down your user story.  I've been using storyboards in my app for the better part of a year, and I can count on one hand the number of times I've had a storyboard merge go badly enough that I had to revert to the common ancestor and rebuild.  And even in those cases, we hadn't diverged so far to make it impossible to recover.


**3: There are things you can do with storyboards that can't be done with nibs**

* Static tables make it easy to quickly layout some static data in table form.
* Container views with embed segues are an awesome way to make a single screen composed of multiple view controllers.  This is huge.


**4: Internationalization**

If you are using base internationalization, storyboards make this a much easier process.  You can now encapsulation localization for multiple screens at a time without having to worry about tying all your labels to outlets and setting them using NSLocalizableString() and you can minimize your usage of NSLocalizableStringFromTable().  You get a single strings file for your entire storyboard, and now don't have to deal with merging Localizable.strings files (if you have multiple modules in your app via  [cocoapods](http://cocoapods.com), or git submodules, or another static lib project in the workspace).


**5: Segues**

These are just very cool.  These encapsulate the transition between screens.  You can create custom segues and make all kinds of creative custom screen transitions.  Unwind segues then make it practically a single click effort to navigate back to any arbitrary location in your storyboard flow without writing hardly any code.  I've had a blast with these as it makes these custom transitions easy for other developers to use.  InterfaceBuilder will recognize the segue name if you name it something like ""SuperSegue"" you will see the segue type ""super"" pop up in the dialog when you wire up two storyboard scenes.


**6: Just because you are using storyboards, doesn't mean you can't use nibs also**

Sometimes you have a view that will show up in multiple user stories.  A log in dialog is a good example.  Say your app allows users to use it without being authenticated, but some features require authentication.  When the user navigates to that portion, the server sends back an authentication challenge where the app is supposed to respond with a login dialog.  You can import the login nib into your storyboard by setting the class on the scene to the login view controller, and then deleting the default view out of the storyboard scene.  When you do this, you will the controller class name in gray in the storyboard scene.  Then just create a modal segue to that login scene and you are practically done.


**So how do we connect storyboards?**

This is actually very simple.  I've created a little class that when I showed it to one of our interview candidates he was like, ""oh cool, it's like your doing storyboard swizzling"" and he was right, so that's what I'm calling it now.  I'll describe that more in detail below, but for now you don't really need to use it.  

So, to connect one storyboard (encapsulating a user story) to another, in this case we're in a navigation controller context:

    OtherViewController *otherStory = [[UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@""OtherStoryboard"" bundle:nil] instantiateInitialViewController];
    [self.navigationController pushViewController:otherStory animated:YES];

That's it.  You could have easily have shown it as a modal, or added it to a tab controller, etc.  It's just another way to instantiate a view controller.


**Storyboard ""Swizzling""** (Editor: ugh, I hate that term.  What is this, a martini?)

So a cool trick I've come up with (at least I think I did, I haven't seen anybody else use it) is a way to link storyboards together in interface builder without having to instantiate view controllers from another storyboard using code.  It uses a special kind of view controller that when loaded from a storyboard, will either replace itself in the storyboard with a scene from another storyboard, or it will add the scene from the other storyboard as a child to itself.  It chooses which approach to use depending on the context. (e.g., in a modal dialog scenario, it uses the latter approach since there is no parent view controller).

So basically is the idea is when you are working on your storyboard, and you get to a point in the story where you want to jump to another storyboard, you segue to this special controller in the ""source"" storyboard.  You set runtime attributes on the storyboard to tell it what ""destination"" storyboard you want to load and what scene from that storyboard you want to start with.  If you only specify the storyboard name, it will use the initial scene defined in that storyboard.

Here's the code:

[StoryboardSwizzleViewController.h](https://github.com/amccarri/StoryboardSwizzleDemo/blob/master/Storyboard%20Swizzle/StoryboardSwizzleViewController.h)
[StoryboardSwizzleViewController.m](https://github.com/amccarri/StoryboardSwizzleDemo/blob/master/Storyboard%20Swizzle/StoryboardSwizzleViewController.m)

And the containing parent project which you can download and see how it fits together:

[StoryboardSwizzleDemo project](https://github.com/amccarri/StoryboardSwizzleDemo)


So there ya go. I'm not sure if that answered your question, but feel free to ask me for clarification on any details that I may have glossed over.  Also hope you find this useful, and if you come up with any improvements to the swizzle code feel free to fork my project and send me a pull request.

Cheers!

1365024947.0	1bm6qw	Runtime Tunables	sethkills	3	1	1	"I use a lot of named constants in my ObjC code, especially for things like pixel offsets, layout rectangles, and other visual interface specifications, and especially when doing iOS apps (due to high demand for skinning).  I do this for a few reasons, the most important being that I can add semantic mappings to those “magic numbers” without having to add comments.  Another reason is that then those constants are available symbolically while debugging.  For example:

    static const CGFloat kAccessoryViewWidth = 18, kAccessoryViewHeight = 22;

This is all well and good, but to achieve the same level of optimization as constant literals, these need to be qualified “static const.”  This means that in order to tweak one of these values and see the results, I need to restart the code/compile/debug cycle over again.  What if I didn’t need to?

I could externalize all of these pixel offsets, and even though the overhead of reading and accessing them will be negligible with few exceptions, I still need to build that externalization system, and most of the time I’ll still need to relaunch the app.  It’s also going to be difficult for me to do this outside of the simulator (Jailbreaking to access the file-system of my own apps, adding files to Documents/ via iTunes?).

Thus, I’ve created a macro for my projects that I call “CONST_TUNABLE.”  Here is how it’s defined:

    #ifdef DEBUG
        #define CONST_TUNABLE volatile
    #else
        #define CONST_TUNABLE const
    #endif // DEBUG

By marking the same variable “volatile” when compiling in the debug configuration, I can set a breakpoint and modify its value very close to where it’s used.  The compiler is prevented from generating code that caches or inlines this value.  Using the “expr” LLDB command, I can modify the value each time the breakpoint is hit.  This could be on every redraw, for instance.  This seems like a clear advantage, especially for apps that take a long time to load or require several steps to reach the same testing scenario.

Here’s an additional macro I find useful.  Often I need to define constant CGRect’s, but Apple’s built-in CGRectMake() function is an inline function returning a structure rather than a macro.  Therefore it is not compile-time constant.  I figure the safest way to initialize a CGRect at compile-time is using a structure initialization with named fields:

    #define RectMakeConst(_x, _y, _w, _h) {.origin = {.x = _x, .y = _y}, .size = {.width = _w, .height = _h}}

I’m a professional Test Engineer currently working on automation testing and performance testing the backend servers (REST-API). I’m looking to expand my knowledge on iOS test automation on my free time, and I’m thinking about buying my first MacBook + developer license in the summer. So I was wondering if it’s possible to participate in an iOS project as an unpaid freelancer/internship kind of a way, as it is pretty dull to develop automated testing for some dummy textbook example apps. I’ve done manual iOS app testing full-time and I’ve taken a course in basic iOS coding and used XCode and UI Automator, so I’m familiar with the platform. 

I already have a full-time job, so I wouldn’t be able to commit full-time nor to strict schedules, so what I am looking for is a project that I could tinker with and learn from on my free time (mostly in weekends). In exchange I would provide feedback and ultimately test automation code for regression testing for the project. Would this be something that you’d be interested in? And are there some kind of legal or other reasons that could prevent this that I’m not aware of? I live in Finland, so there might also be the time zone issue to consider. Anyway, if this sounds feasible, let me know. :) And more so if this can’t be done from a legal point of view. :D

Edit: To clarify, what I mean by automated testing in this case is the automated functional testing via the UI. I'm not talking about unit testing, as I'm not competent enough (yet) in Objective-C.

I've been doing all of the development from work, and now I am getting a Mac for my apartment so I can work on it more frequently from home. How can I get all of the files I'm using (everything from the xcode project to all the .pngs that are in the app) onto my new Mac?

Maybe what I want I do is not possible, but I'd love to know the easiest way if there is one. I'm afraid I may also need to relocate all of the images in my app into Dropbox or something, which I'm pretty sure would require me to remove them from the project and put them back in.
