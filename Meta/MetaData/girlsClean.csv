1363014757.0	1a32e5	Thoughts on Adam, shirts and weirdos.		46	5	21	"Apologies in advance for the book.  Skip to the very bottom if you want the short and sweet of it. 

It was tragic watching Adams fall this episode, and I knew it was coming all season.  I'll be honest, Adam is a bit of an micro-obsession of mine.  We both have histories with alcohol, and I can just relate to the character so easily.  All season we've seen him since the cops were called, he's been putting a shirt on, both physically and metaphorically.  He's been putting on a show of his life being put together, or as best as someone as broken as he is see's put.  There is so much in the world that everyone else ignore's that he notices, and so much they care about that he doesn't but he's trying to understand the way everything works.  Sometimes, he fails (like the Dog) and sometimes, he succeeds (for a bit) like with Natalia.  

But the thing is, that's not Adam. HE DOESN'T FUCKING WANT TO WEAR A SHIRT!  HE LIKES BEING THE WEIRD ART KID!  I mean think about that.  He hates shirts, shirts are restrictive, and completely unnecessary in every utilitarian sense except warmth.  I'm sure the only reason he wears pants is for pockets and legality.  He was bound to snap back into shirtless Adam mode, and it all started with Hannah.  All season long he'd been trying to act as normal as possible, and that was even reflected in his shirts, like the Dog episode he's wearing a cut off tshirt, like... the bare minimum of shirtness.  Around Natalia, he had even started wearing... *collars*.  He was becoming normal, and seeing the wreck that was Hannah made him realize he was just putting on a show.  He had to show Natalia how weird he really was, and he went *way* to far.


Lets go back to him and Natalia having sex the first time.  He says ""I love how clear you are with me"" but what I heard was ""I hate that you have these tiny rules, when the last relationship was the most reckless, debasing, humiliating, and satisfying sexual relationship of my past... where every weird desire was explored.  And you don't like soft touching?  What the fuck am I supposed to do?""  

But he saw Hannah, and he remembered how good it felt, to be honest, to be raw, to that *weirdo* that he's always wanted to be.  I promise you, when he was getting off on Hannah pretending to be a preteen streetwalker, that was more about just seeing what that would be like... with Hannah, because he trusted her to not get weirded out by that.  And all those emotions and feelings came back.  He wanted to be weird.  He wanted to be honest and raw.  He wanted to be *shirtless*.

So he drinks, he takes her back to his cave of weirdness, his cave of raw weird emotions, and he does his raw weird thing.  He was hoping Natalia would open up, and get weird to.  He was hoping that she would expose some totally embarrassing, thought or desire or want... or at least connect and play along with his debasing because hey... she didn't care if he is that weird kid.  He was hoping to have an emotional connection with her and it went just about as awfully as it could of gone (hopeful rape roleplay ending up more just rape and all)

I feel really bad, because at the end his shirt came off and he was just that weird fucking kid again, who no one liked, and no one understood.

**TL;DR:  Adam has been putting on a shirt (metaphor) all season, and this episode it came off.  Adam is weird.  He knows it.  He doesn't want to be normal.  He likes being different.  But he needs validation, because when he was younger (probably before he worked out) no one accepted his eccentricities, like not wanting to wear a shirt.  Hannah was the last to validate his sexual eccentricities, and Natalia couldn't (understandably so).  Adam is just a weird kid who doesn't like weird shirts, has some hangups, and just wants someone to understand him**

**TL;DRer: Adam knows he's weird, hates shirts.  Natalia didn't embrace his weirdness.  That hurt.  he hurt people, he took his shirt off**

Adam running to Hannah to save the day and the music coming on right when he leaves his apartment. It also just felt too ""TV"" and not so ""real"" like the first season was. "	t5_2qj0h	True

1363700907.0	1albe9	The fantheory (not mine) that Girls is a show about a book seems more likely to me now.	fnordcircle	40	5	22	"I read it from someone else here, but I think that ending to season 2 sort of clinched it for me.

The theory goes that parts of the show are 'real' and parts of the show are what Hannah is writing.  That there are two separate worlds, basically.  I'm not sure who is part of which world, but right now I'm leaning towards Shoshanna and Jessa being book-only characters.  I think Marnie, Ray, Hannah, Adam and Charlie are real but Charlie and Adam are just ex-boyfriends that Hannah is now writing about.

Anyways, parts of the last episode that were real for Hannah were the OCD and pressure from her publisher.  When her head hits the pillow and she says 'I have to write a book in a day.' that was real.

The rest of the stuff - Marnie and Charlie getting together, Adam doing the 'run through the city' stuff was all what she hastily wrote to get something into her publisher's hands.  That's why it was so over the top cheesy.  It's because she had to rush to get anything to him so he couldn't sue her.

It also explains stuff like, Charlie going from a guy dating headband girl without much going on in his life to suddenly becoming a wealthy, mature business owner.  Because the real Charlie is long gone and Hannah has just been writing about him now as basically her fantasy for what she wants to happen for her friend.

This also makes the publisher's comments about how he didn't read all of her pages because he didn't want to a sort of criticism of parts of the show.  But only the book parts.

I dunno, it's probably all BS, but I think it is fun and it is the best explanation for the ridiculously awful 1980s movie ending."	t5_2qj0h	True

Can't we just accept that SOME adults act like this and move on to enjoying a pretty funny show?	kintaeb	23	2	16	"I had heard a little bit about this show a few weeks ago but didn't get around to watching it until this morning.  I tore through all of the episodes.  I thought it had moments where it was unrealistic and a little off, but overall I enjoyed all of it and I've grown to enjoy the characters.

Maybe it's because I'm a male, but I honestly see every single one of the characters in the show as being flawed, pretty bad people, which when you think about it is how most people are.  I don't think the women are just spinless idiots with no self worth, I feel like they make poor choices and want validation.  The guys aren't great characters, the most likable of them (Charlie) is probably my least favorite and the least likable (Adam) is my favorite.  But that's because it's a comedy, and I watch it to laugh.  Why do people have to analyze it like this show has said ""This is how all adults act, this is where society is going, choose your side""?  I watch it because it's funny and interesting.

That's not to say it doesn't have things to talk and think about.  I think it's incredibly thought provoking, but it shouldn't draw such hateful speech at all.  Same goes for Veep as well I guess."	t5_2qj0h	True

The thing about Girls that I love is it acknowledges the crazy in all of us. Hannah tries so hard to find a balance between loving herself as a person, saying fuck the hate let me be me, and being good — both by moral and societal standards. In the season two finale her and Adam find each other in that place, that quest, to strike balance. It is such a beautiful scene because it is truly so raw and vulnerable. To be held in that moment of pure ugliness, self hate and questioning that Hannah is experiencing when Adam runs to her, is so comforting that it reminds us of the moments we have wanted and needed that. 

Lena is such a genius. She pulls out what is complexly beautiful in the female (and human in general) soul and shows that there are so many angles at which to see it, to understand and admire it.

Thanks,"" I prefer to imagine a scene that would live up to the wonderful writing that Lena and her writing crew produce.

&gt;
&gt;Laird: (uncomfortable) Oh. Hey. Hi. Um. Look, I'm just sort of, um, hanging out with them, sort of looking after them so they don't get into too much trouble. Because of all the drugs they've done, you know?

SheHe	29	13	17	"First of all, I genuinely believed that she takes women a few steps back (my whole statement is an elaboration on this), and was disappointed that she is such a tacky 'Jap' stereotype (were we not above this, Lena Dunham?).

As well, I am incredibly over the whole Valley-Girls thing. I was faithful that I would never have to tolerate someone like her again after high school. I considered Shosh to be more of a cartoon character, which in my opinion weakened the rhythm of the cast. 

THAT BEING SAID, I wholeheartedly concur with her sentiment in the last episode. It was the first time I genuinely liked her, and she definitely has my sympathies now. I hope this is a permanent change, and that she will stop BEING. LIKE. OMG. SO. WEIRD. AND. LIKE. SO. VALLEY. GIRLISH. AND. LIKE. TOTALLY. RIDICULOUS.

It bothers me SO much when women dumb themselves down to be trendy or cute, or perhaps even more accessible to men. I believed, until last night, that this character was a prime example of this. And nothing but this.

But last night, her rant and her decision making showed growth. It showed autonomy and evolution. Which was such a breath of fresh air for this character. Not only that, but I came upon a realization recently: Despite the fact that she lives in New York and struggles to breathe among the hippest of hipsters, Shosh has managed to keep herself from getting tangled up in the ironic and blasé facade that has become so prevalent among recent twenty-somethings.

She has become the most authentic and least self-centered character. Last night's episode has forced me to see the many facets to her character that I was not able to see before. And I really, really hope this is a step in the right direction."	t5_2qj0h	True

That relates to what I'm talking about. As Season 2 goes on I more and more feel the hand of Dunham, clumsily puppeteering the show. Donald Glover's quick exit was actually funny in that context the link gives, but I feel like it's gotten to the point of immaturity just how defiant Dunham is being with the show. It's starting to feel like Dunham's big thing instead of well, just a show, in my opinion I'm starting to feel her bleed into the material too much. Given that she also acts in the show which I do not object to, it might be difficult for me to articulate this, but I'm starting to become self-aware too often, to the point where Dunham herself may be overshadowing her character.

However, maybe I'm wrong, and maybe I'm just unhappy about the increasing focus on Hannah to the expense of much more likable characters and this is just a rationalization to justify that irritation. Everyone's been thrown to the side, and Ray was made to blow up so Hannah could have an excuse to go over to apologize (I very much doubt she would've gone over if Ray handled that calmly). But we still have the rest of the season to see how this all turns out.

1358545739.0	16ua5e	Prediction on Shoshanna	hey_sergio	31	22	19	"She's going to try to kill herself.  Calling it now.

Evidence: 

(1) She puts up a front.  In S1 she tried to convince that dude that she's not the type to get attached, which he did not believe.  In this last episode she tried convincing everyone that she was ""over"" Ray (deflowered not devalued).  If she harbors suicidal feelings, she will not reach out to people about them.


(2) She is insecure.  I feel like that point is obvious.  She tries pretty hard to get people to really like her.  She tries hard to fit in.  Very accommodating to others.


(3) No one is actually close to her.  People prone to suicide tend to be driven there by loneliness.  She tries hard to make it seem like she is not lonely but her true nature is that she gets overly attached very fast, which turns people off, so she learned to try and outwardly downplay her desire to bond quickly.  


(4) Ray.  He has the potential to make her do crazy shit.  The emojis demonstrate that she has these overly attached girlfriend tendencies that drive men away, yet no one seems to acknowledge that she was crazy about Ray because when she arrived at the party it was she who brought up the topic of Ray possibly being there.  If she had been public about her obsession with Ray there is no way both of them would have been invited--or at least the subject would not have been treated so casually by Hannah and her roommate.  Note also how she made sure to be the first one at the party (she wanted full control over the circumstances in which she knew she would see him again).  If Ray has this much control over her feelings, then one false move (intentional or otherwise) could make her do something really irrational.


(5) Passive cries for help.  Although she is putting up this front, you'll notice she does or says things that people don't really pick up on, but in her mind a caring person who paid attention to those things would listen to them and try to help her out.  Kind of like those cryptic facebook statuses with song lyrics or questions directed at no one in particular (but totally directed at someone in particular).  The clear foreshadowing here is **her karaoke song choice: Sean Kingston - Beautiful Girls**  which is about being afraid to get attached to someone beautiful, and the pain driving you to suicide.  I consider it clear because it more or less is Shoshanna in a nutshell.  No one really paid attention to her in the midst of the party, and people just think of her as this comic relief.  Her passive, vague message alluding to suicide was ignored by everyone.


**So I predict that Season 2 will be some quasi-romance between her and Ray that means way more to her than it does to him, but she hides it, and he does something that hurts her and she tries to kill herself, giving the show a serious punctuation and the characters feel guilty about not being truly attentive to her.  She might even deny that it was deliberate (if she survives) and probably the reason that the suicide attempt fails will be because of something kind of funny**"	t5_2qj0h	True

1364015935.0	1augcb	Girls: why I love it (and hate it) and why you should too	toyfulskerl	11	5	2	"This is going to be long, so if you want a TL;DR, then here: **I hated the season finale of Girls, but I think the reason I hated it was *because* I liked it**. There you go; if words scare you then you can bail now.

One of the reasons why I love Girls so much, at the same time finding it so painful to watch, is that Hannah reminds me so much of a recent ex and that so many of the male characters in the show (including Adam) remind me of myself. This feeling isn't exclusive to me, I hear a lot of people say ""I had an experience kind of like that"" when they talk about Girls. To watch so much of my previous relationships played out on the TV screen is painful; my understanding of myself, and my own 'Hannah', informs my understanding of so much of the inner life of the characters on the show. For example, where so many people on the net had trouble understanding why Joshua would accept Hannah into his home and life the way he did, I had no such difficulty. I have **been** Joshua, I know exactly what he saw in Hannah, and why he accepted her craziness. And while it is a scene that never got played out on our TV screens, I also am intimately familiar with the feelings of loss Joshua felt when he came home from work that day to find his house immaculate and empty. I feel like I know these characters, because I **am** these characters.

Let's talk about the entire series first, before I get into the details of how I feel about the finale. Girls is about relationships, first and foremost. It's really not so much about situations and the crazy things people can get into as it is about how those situations put people into conflict with one another; when they have a situation that the characters are involved in (a wild party in Bushwick), that situation is only there to allow the characters to explore their relationships with one another. To understand the characters, we need to understand their relationships.

Let's start with Shoshanna and Ray. Shoshanna is young and inexperienced, trying to figure out who she is and her place in the world; Ray is quite a bit older, has a pretty good grasp of who his, and is unhappy with the place that he's found in the world (and just the world in general).  To really understand Shoshanna you must realize that her mental life has her wanting to take the role of one of the characters from ""Sex and the City""; to Shoshanna SatC is everything that is cool about being a woman in NYC, she wants her life to be that cool, ergo, the more like SatC her life is, the cooler she is. Shoshanna can easily imagine Marnie and Jessa being characters from the show and repeatedly bores them with those rambling fantasies. When it comes to Ray, however, Shoshanna is at a loss. Ray is nothing like any of the characters in SatC. However, Ray does (for some inexplicable reason to her) seem to like her and want to be around her. He seems to find something in her that she doesn't see herself and that is a powerful attractant.

At least, for a while.

Ray is bitter, but he's bitter because he's lost his hopes and dreams. He's a wastrel, a loser. He's 33, with a shitty job and no aspirations. I can easily understand Ray because I've been him. He's attracted to Shoshanna because she's the exact opposite of him and her effervescence and drive are charming, even as they are somewhat annoying. Shoshanna still has the enthusiasm that has been beaten out of Ray by life and, by being around her, he can borrow some of that enthusiasm. He finds drive within himself, not because he wants to make himself better, but because he wants to be better *for* Shosh. He finds renewed hope through her. And this is exactly the right time, when Ray is just starting to hope again, for Shoshanna to go chasing after her dreams of being a character from SatC; Ray might actually be good for her (as she is for him), but when you are barely in your 20's you are still hoping for 'the perfect match' rather than the 'pretty good thing I have right now'. This is what makes the series finale for them heartbreaking and perfect; this is exactly what really happens in real life (as I can unfortunately say with assurity) and why I loved that part of the finale. Both Shoshanna and Ray are in a bad place (whether they realize it or not) which seems to be the ending theme for this season.

Now we have Jessa. Through the course of the show we've come to know Jessa pretty well and understand why she is the way she is. I've known a few people like Jessa in my life; the most I've ever been able to achieve with them is 'cordial disdain', as anything more means putting up with their self-involved bullshit and requires too much effort and sacrifice. Jessa is an emotional pit that sucks you in and spits out your bones. What's important to see in the series is just how much Hanna admires her. Why? Why does Hanna put up with Jessa, follow her around like a puppy dog and enable her crap? Remember that from the very first episode, Marnie says ""Every time she comes into town, you go on some week-long bender, and then she leaves to go off to her next country and I'm left to pick up the pieces."" What does Hanna see in Jessa? ""I just think she's fun,"" say Hanna. It's not that Hannah doesn't see how self-centered, abusive or self-serving Jessa is, it's that Hannah envies all of the life experiences that Jessa's character faults have brought her. But we'll get back to Hannah in a bit. Jessa's story arc ends early in this season with her devolving back to her normal pattern: when things become too difficult for her (or just not to her liking), she leaves for a new adventure somewhere else, abandoning anyone (Hannah in this case) who might have been there helping her. I don't think anyone can deny that Jessa is in a bad place, even if it might not be a particularly new place for Jessa, by season's end.

That brings us to Marnie and Charlie. When we first meet them, Marnie is 'the perfect girl' and Charlie is an enabling pussy. That's not my opinion actually, but Hannah's from the very first episode. A better analysis would be that Marnie is just starting to live the life she's envisioned for herself and Charlie, doing his best to be the nicest boyfriend ever, has become a smothering blanket. In Charlie's viewpoint however, he's just doing what he's always done, been there for Marnie when she needs him, and done his best to support her emotionally. You can immediately see why Marnie would hate that and she does….at least she does up until she sees that Charlie, after she's dumped him, is doing successfully both in his dating and professional life, neither of which she can say for herself. As her professional life plans unravel and she finds that she is neither ""the good friend"" nor considered worthy of being the girlfriend of the guy she's sleeping with, she's left feeling powerless and empty. Getting Charlie back would go a long way to making her feel better about herself and her place in life and she goes after him with the blundering confidence of someone who can't really envision him turning her down. Charlie doesn't disappoint her, only himself, and you are left at the end of the season finale with the sick feeling that these two people, in spite of their Hollywood bullshit ending, are in an incredibly bad place.

And that leaves us with Hannah and Adam, the two most broken people in this series, the two people in this series I understand the most. The overall story arc for Hannah is ""her journey to become the person she is going to be"" (not a perfect quote from Lena Dunham, but certainly something to that effect.) But the point of the show isn't that Hannah is 'trying to find her place in the world', Hannah knows what her place should be (she is a writer, ""the voice of her generation""); the conflict comes from the world not recognizing what she holds to be truth and Hannah deciding that the best way of fixing that discrepancy is to 'experience the truth of the world' (which somehow translates as ""Do All The Drugs And Sex!"") The show has been about showing Hannah's skydive into destruction, a destruction that, in so many ways, she really *wants* for herself. While she might not have wanted to be cut off by her parents, since then she's consistently chosen the hard way every chance she's gotten. I believe the whole point of the bottle episode of S2E5, ""One Man's Trash"", was to show that Hannah could have the self-realization that, while she did want to be happy, she wanted the bad things, the things that would allow her to become a good writer, more. Once she's chosen that destructive way however things spiral out of her control and she finds herself crumbling under the pressure with no one to turn to. Jessa literally abandoned her, Marnie has become distant and unfaceable, her parents misinterpret every overture she makes towards them (or, worse, correctly interpret every overture she makes) and she's left with no one to turn to. Even the ex-junkie apartment supervisor that she had a one-night-stand with isn't interested in putting up with her psychodrama. She's left feeling alone, unsupported emotionally and out of control.

Why would Adam want any part of that? Why did Adam want to be a part of that in the beginning? Hannah was just a hookup. She didn't ask him about his life, didn't try to be part of his life and he was willing to accept that; I think he could understand that, even if it didn't encourage him to be anything more than that with her. He gave her only as much of himself as she asked for. Once Hannah started telling him that she wanted more, that she was unhappy just being a hookup, it must have confused the fuck out of him. And then, once he starts opening up and making her a part of his life, she gets flighty and runs away. The beginning of season two showed just how badly things can get fucked up between the two of them, with Adam not backing off until he is literally arrested for being the 'psycho stalker ex-boyfriend'. Understandably, we can see in S2E4 and S2E9 that Adam still has unresolved feelings about her. So, why would he want any part of that craziness, the craziness of the half-dressed girl walking down the NY streets at night coming back from the ER?

Because she needs some sort of emotional stability in her life and he **sees** that. He **sees** that there is no one else in her life who is helping her, who **sees** just how much of a mess she is, who **sees** just how much worse her life could get if he's not there to help her keep things together. And there is a part of him that wants to be needed that much, a part that wants to fix things, that wants to do something that feels like it matters. He's already been burned badly by her before, and even knows that she's probably going to burn him badly again in the future, but he just can't *not* try to help. I know what it's like to be the person who can see all the emotional turmoil that another person is going through and find himself unable to resist reaching out to try and help that person.

Hannah **is** going to burn him badly in the end, we know this about her. It's not just her consciously choosing the dark path of 'experience', although that alone will inevitably encourage their split (yes, there is such a thing as a happy writer, but unhappy writers who are driven by their unhappiness are a trope for a reason); given the choice between happiness with Adam or the ability to 'be a voice of a generation' she will choose the latter, just as she did with Joshua. Hannah is narcissistic and a shit-stirrer. She is someone who has to process things several times through her head before she decides on how she feels about it. When she reacts immediately, those reactions tend to be purely emotional, not a reaction with thought behind it, and this is why she seems to throw herself at situations. When she *does* think things through, she almost always makes her decision based on ""which choice will make for a better story?"" She may be guileless, but that lack of guile doesn't keep her from setting up the people who are in her life for failure. It seems inevitable that, once Hannah has overcome the momentary obstacles that are in her way, she will begin to chafe at the anchor that the relationship between her and Adam must become.

And here's why I hate the ending of this season. It's because, in real life, Hannah doesn't call Adam and they never get back together. In real life Hannah does find someone else to connect with (an acquaintance, a co-worker, even a random bar hookup), and decides to keep moving forward, focuses on leaving all the craziness of Adam behind, and continues without him. In real life Hannah and Adam never get their Hollywood bullshit reunion.

And it's why I love this ending of the season. Its Hollywood bullshit and I love it because I know, through hard-won experience, that Hollywood bullshit doesn't really happen in real life. I know how the real life Adam's life works out and there is a part of me that is happy that there is at least one Adam who gets to reclaim some happiness before his inevitable destruction. But I can't help but think, as we put away our soggy tissues and embrace the warm and fuzzy feelings this season finale engendered, that we know Hannah and Adam are in an incredibly bad place and they aren't going to get to enjoy their 'rom-com ending' for long."	t5_2qj0h	True

1340501632.0	vi8vz	DAE think this show was about how shallow and self-absorbed these characters are?	cancle	9	7	4	"Seriously.

I just finished watching the series last night. I watched it in two blocks: from episode one to episode six, and then from episode seven to the end. 


After finishing the sixth episode, I still found all the characters reasonably likeable, and I felt I could relate to them. At this point: 

**Hannah** has finally committing to being finacially independant, and was shown to have a warm relationship with her parents.

**Marnie** had finally broken free of her long-term relationship, which seemed like an honest and mature thing to do.

**Jessa** was still working as a nanny, and while she seemed irresponsible and flakey, was still doing something to earn money and remain independant.



However, from the seventh episode onwards, I found that all of the flaws written into the characters were magnified to the point where it becomes impossible to sympathise with them. For example:

**Hannah** is shown to be uncommited to her writing and increasingly unreasonable in her relationships. Even though I felt she was the most likeable out of the three, her incapacity to make good decisions made me lose any sense of identification with her character. For example, who in their right mind would want to live with an ex-boyfriend who is bitchy and hostile?

Even though **Marnie** begins to look more and more desperate in the later episodes, I found her to be the most sympathetic character by the season final. Regardless, it's hard to believe her and the Wedding Celebrant getting together, and her thing with Jessa seemed unlikely.

**Jessa's** marriage makes her character seem completely shallow and materialistic. We know that Thomas is an asshole, and Jessa's wedding makes her seem like all her ideals are thrown away, simply so that she can have a comfortable life.


If the point of the series was to show how unlikeable many 20-something girls are, then I would say it was succesful, and well-written. However, because I couldn't relate to the characters in the last half of the series, it ceased to be entertaining, and bits that I should have found funny just seemed contrived and unrealistic. 

I'm interested to hear if anyone else had this experience, or if I'm just trying to read too much into the series.

Thanks.

Anyway, I've been discussing the second season with friends for a few days and it occurred to me that the most common complaints we're having are the same ones he lists for not liking the book. Namely:

* It doesn't seem like the same old fun-loving Hannah

This season is very different from the version of Girls that we were presented with in season 1. That ""pitch"" was all sex, drugs, experimentation, and 'real' drama. This season was pretty different. Hannah has sex with Laird and that weirdo teenager, then gets OCD and tries to make herself deaf for attention. Marnie tries out something new, then when it fails she freaks and runs back to safe waters. Shoshana and Ray break up. Jessa tries to face down her daddy issues, then just runs away. Etc. It's a downer, but it's all pretty realistic stuff. Life isn't always partying and experimentation all the time, because eventually things settle down and when you reflect back you're not always proud of the things you've done. This is especially true of people in their early 20s, who are dealing with the rollercoaster that is developing into an adult rapidly post-college. The problem with this is that it's an aspect of life that's not sexy or traditionally very sell-able. The publisher is confused by it but wants to give Hannah the benefit of the doubt based off her earlier brash display. We feel this way too! I was totally half hoping that the finale would be a return to form of sorts - and I'm very glad that it wasn't. Dunham's doing her own thing with this show, and is forcing us to deal with all of the shitty aspects of life along with the exciting ones.

My thoughts.. 

- Loved the hilarious story around the rabbit 

- Loved how at first Frank looked hipster and edgy and maybe cute, but he was just a complete geek. Someone who wears weird 70's stuff not to be fashionable and ironic. 

- Jessa's blow up with her dad was really powerful to me. I am in my early twenties and I feel like inside I am freaking out all the time and the inner me is screaming I'm a child, why is this happening to me?! Why am I paying bills, why am I getting audited by the IRS, why do I have to pay for my sick dog, why do I have to work until it's dark, don't they all know I'm just a kid?! I thought it was evident that all of us, no matter the age, have a part of us screaming that we're the child and want to be taken care of. You could tell her dad wanted to yell the same thing back at her. 

- Hannah's conversation with her parents, I think we've all been there. You push parents so far and can be so dismissive that when you need them or have something nice to say, you're in shock when they react suspicious and in turn dismiss you. 

- Purely speculative but towards the end all I could think was WOW Hannah definitely has an STD and then gave it to that weird man baby and something insane is going to happen. But then I remembered he finished on her leg crease. I died laughing, I have DEFINITELY been there with an extremely inexperienced let down. Hahaha. Another spin though.. what if she does have one and gave it to Josh? That would be so awkward and humiliating and crazy for her to go through if he tracked her down.

It seemed like it was a totally different show. The types of camera shots, the themes, the characters, everything...seemed like it was intentionally wrong in some way that referenced popular culture. It was like it was some meta-episode for all sitcoms.

WTF was that episode?

1363604241.0	1ainy2	Why do so many people think Shosh 'won' the breakup?	tbutters	4	5	8	"It's great seeing her assertive (well, for her,) but I don't think that's praiseworthy on it's own. Ray's been consistent and frank for their entire relationship, so Shoshanna's therapy suggestion bugs me. She apparently expected him to change this entire time; why is that seen as a good thing?

They're very different people, a break up makes sense. Their compatibility seemed a bit forced from day one. So they end things. Fair enough. It sucks that Ray loved her, and was trying to make her happy. In turn, she cheated on him and expected him to become a different man. When she finally realizes that people don't work that way...congrats Shosh. She should have had that sorted out years ago. 

So why did she win? Did the writers just give her wittier dialog, or was she actually more justified? "	t5_2qj0h	True
1363549928.0	1ahaa1	Girls: Is my Adam different from your Adam?	Lechateau	2	3	2	"So, I've discovered girls this weekend and I binged on it. 

Yes, I saw everything this weekend. I guess my experience with this show is a bit different from everyone else's. Adam was what got me hooked, the second I saw him.

(I am a 30 yo female, European, living in the US for the past couple of years, I apologize for my English in advance)

I think that the first couple of episodes Lena paints a really ugly portrait of Adam, I didn't buy it and I'll explain why my Adam is a bit different.


Most of the time we don't see real Adam, just what the other characters make of him and I really think he is jut misunderstood. 


I tried to be vanilla and normal, and fit in for most of my life. I was pretty good at it. My family thought I was a very level headed person, always did good in my endeavors, got a good PhD in a hot subject, so I really fit in.

The truth is most if the time I just really wanted to do bad things to my partners. When single, and anonymous I would fuck man, women, multiples, I wanted to subdue them, make them make dirty things and carry around displaying them. When in a relationship I would go back to ""normal"", plain, simple. I would get frustrated at times, sometimes the kinky would leak, they would ask what the fuck are you doing? 

And then I met my current bf. A few weeks after we started hanging out I caught him masturbating while stuffing his face in dirty panties, I sat there and watched the whole thing when he finished I walked in a few insults flied and he got aroused again, I was in heaven, I had found a partner in crime.

Outside all the twisted shit we do in bed and a bit of crassness on bf side (he is a bit crude, but a gentle giant in the end) he is the best person I have ever met. He is truly good and is always there for me.

The scene when Adam pees on Hannah? I did that to my bf, he was washing his feet or something and I just angled myself to pee on his feet. 

In the end I just wish I could see more of him.

1355379515.0	14ru68	Discussion thread about the four main characters. Dont spoil it for me, Im on episode 7.		3	4	0	"I just got done with episode 7 and I truly do not like the two main characters. I mean, I find them interesting, but Hannah and Marty truly are very selfish as Elijah and Adam just got done explaining. I am hoping that these two find some revelations and start thinking about the other people around them. I dont blame Marty for not liking her boyfriend (forgot name) of four years because he is kind of a pussy, but I do think she went about it the wrong way.  Although, I do know what its like to be in a relationship for a long time and not feel anything. But, me being a dude, had to side with the boyfriend when he came up with that decision line--he decided on her. Elijah revealed more about Marty that was not cool with me either. I dont like Marty much at all besides her being a foil for Hannah. I hope Elijah returns.

Hannah is interesting, of course, she handles things in exactly the opposite I would, but her inner monologue is great humor. I am beginning to think the point of the show is not to like her--she reminds me of a watered down version of Louie of Louis CK on FX

The other two characters are my favorites, especially the virgin, Shishana. She provides the most comic relief. I hope the thing works out with Marty's ex's friend. Hes pretty cool.

And the other one (forgot her name with the british accent) is really cool because she doesnt hold anything back. She has convictions and while i dont endorse most of her actions, I can see the value of not giving a shit what people think of you.

Adam revealed quite a few things this latest episode and I suspect there will be some potential for him to be cool. I really liked what he had to say to Hannah before the taxi showed up.

Not too much detail here, but I dont want to spoil all that much for future viewers.

I do find it addicting and refreshing watching characters i dont quite agree with. "	t5_2qj0h	True

I think it's got a few seasons in it, but I'm not so sure it has the staying power of a multi-season series.

However, one of my really close friends asked her but she rejected him, so now I have to wait awhile to ask her, but she still told all her friends that she wanted to go with me. However, just yesterday, another one of my close friends (or so i thought) went up to her and told her that I talk shit about her even though I don't, and now she's really upset at me and I really don't have the energy to deal with this anymore. I know that I probably sound like a whining baby but I really just didn't know what to do. I know there's no perfect solution but if you guys have any suggestions I would really appreciate it.
