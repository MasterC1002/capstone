Summary below [(read this thread for further info)](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ytjvi/destiny_of_rstarcraft_fame_forfeits_his_mlg/):

There is a guy called 'Destiny' (or Steven Bonell), who is a minor celebrity in the world of Starcraft II.

'Destiny' was chatting/flirting with a girl known as 'Bluetea'.  She apparently shared nude photos of herself with Destiny and Destiny sent her photos of his penis (while having a girlfriend). 

Destiny then went on to ridicule her appearance to his friends in a chat room and one of them leaked the logs to Bluetea.

Humiliated, Bluetea logs into Destiny's twitter account (he gave her his password for some reason) and posted pictures of his dick ([see her reddit thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/yt1a8/to_spare_erin_heres_whats_going_on/)).

What does this all lead to?

In reality he copied the garnishes from a year-old dish called [**Lamb 86**](http://alineaphile.com/2012/05/garnish-key-for-alinea-restaurants-lamb-86-recipe/) at Alinea, one of the most famous restaurants in the world (scroll down the page to see all the garnishes listed in a grid). 

What's worse is that neptuneway [**appears to be**](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/vppqj/hey_chicago_what_do_you_do_for_work/c56ot0o?context=3) a chef de partie at L2O, another Michelin-starred Chicago restaurant (there's also [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/u7y0h/cleaning_crabs_at_chicagos_michelin_awarded_l20/) and [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/1c8puk/beef_cauliflower_onion_and_black_truffle/)) right down the street from Alinea. If this guy was caught doing this in real life it would destroy his reputation, assuming he has any. 

Anyway, if he is who he says he is, I think neptuneway's comment is definitely worstof material.

Recently it came out that karmanaut was bechus. It was raised again in the relationship advice thread today when he [replied to his own comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/cuji0/how_to_abuse_your_mod_powers_on_rrelationship/c0vdwqv?context=2)

Anyway today I was looking through the award section and trying to find the “bestof 2009” awards but the link was broken. So I decided to google it and see if I could find it.

The first link I got was this one:

http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof2009/comments/algx1/commenter_of_the_year/?sort=top

Everyone you would expect had been nominated: bozarking, kleinbl00, karmanaut, flossdaily. But as I went through I noticed something else. bechus was trolling the nominees.

Here he is trolling kleinbl00 about “ragequitting”. I thought this might be true so I looked it up. It turns out kleinbl00 never “ragequit”, he quit because people had started to contact his home address and call him in person. It seems he had made this pretty clear and anyone who was familiar with Reddit would have known.

Here is bechus stating that bozarking shouldn’t be given the award.

In the official nominations bechus shows up again:

http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof2009/comments/aor7y/final_round_of_voting_commenter_of_the_year/c0injap

This time he’s claiming that flossdaily shouldn’t be given the award because he’s too new. Not 'trolling' but he's actively saying 'I agree, flossdaily shouldn't get the award' as his main account karmanaut sits right behind him.

What the fuck? Karmanaut is supposed to be some pillar of reddit. He moderates a bunch of different subreddits including /r/askreddit and he’s going around on alternate accounts and trolling other users?

He was nominated for commenter of the year, and instead of saying “thanks, you guys are awesome”, he jumps on alt accounts and starts giving reasons why the other nominees shouldn’t win? I liked karmanaut but that's pathetic.

So this was a lovely AMA during the whole Prop 37 debate.  It's an older post and enough time has passed that making fun of it and reading the cringe is wonderful.  It has been archived so hey, the votes don't matter, so why not share the trainwreck.

It got FANTASTIC when you realized that poor Stacy was making new accounts to keep herself from getting downvoted and to ask herself questions.

http://notjustaprettyface.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/fran1.jpg - Here is Stacy with 'The Nanny'.  Totally unrelated to the AMA.   She also wrote a book on the cosmetic industry.

Here are most of the accounts that I found that were created that day and only asked or commented once and never have been seen again.

Perhaps if you need to create 15 other Reddit accounts to make it appear you have a 'groundswell' of support, you really don't.

I'll start off by saying there is nothing surprising in this thread... it progressed exactly the way anyone who has spent any time online would expect a thread on this topic to. Roughly half the posts ask if the girl was hot, the white knight brigade immediately jump on the bandwagon and start downvoting everything, even people who have genuine questions. People start jumping on the negative comments, criticising the people who made them, to ride the karma train. The most downvoted comments are guys who seem to be furious at being denied a similar opportunity, or simply call the OP, who seems to have been severely traumatised by the experience, a fag.

I thought I made a fairly reasonable point about how a repost for one person might not be a repost for everybody, and that since Reddit threads tend to ""die,"" reposts are actually a valid method to reopen discussion for a link.

Ever since I posted that, I've been getting a PM from a user named [Jushooter](http://www.reddit.com/user/Jushooter) every couple of days. Every message contains the link to the video I wrote my comment on. Here's [a screenshot of my inbox](http://i.imgur.com/QqpDM.png).

I understand that some people really get really tired of seeing reposts on Reddit, but this behavior is out of line. At first I thought he was being clever, but at this point he has gone too far. For harassing me and perhaps other users, I submit this to you, worstof.

**TL;DR**: Some troll is spamming me because he disagreed with a comment I made over a week ago.

*EDIT:* Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post this. It seemed appropriate to me, and I just thought he needed to be called out for this.

*EDIT1:* I never posted the link he spammed me with. I simply commented on it. I'm not a ""reposter.""

*EDIT2:* BAWWWW

*EDIT3:* The user has apologized and assured me he'll stop. I'm going to take his name off of the post body and mark this ticket as *resolved*.

*EDIT4:* Turns out he's a liar too. **He didn't stop.** His name is going back up. [Jushooter](http://www.reddit.com/user/Jushooter), the worst of Reddit. I'm sure glad I didn't delete this (like he begged me too)."	t5_2qh3y	True

1327465280.0	ovldy	The subtleties of being banned and having your comments removed in r/anarchism &amp; r/metanarchism.	CantSpeakFreely	40	17	20	"As someone who has long followed [the drama in r/anarchism](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/j6txt/censorship_in_ranarchism_23_screenshots_that_will/) and its related subreddit (r/metanarchism), I found it interesting when the creator of r/metanarchism was recently criticizing the very person whom they left in charge of that subreddit (by de-modding themself a few months back).    

(For those who may not know, r/metanarchism is the subreddit the moderators of r/anarchism use to to discuss bans, flair, comment removal, and other aspects of that subreddit.)  

Not wanting to be banned from either subreddit, I created an alternate account to express my skepticism at the sincerity of the supposed in-fighting amongst these two individuals who are heavily involved in both subreddits.  [The underlying issue at hand had to do with the fact that a group of users was unilaterally barred from the community by Skobrin](http://www.reddit.com/r/metanarchism/comments/otdfg/sick_of_ancaps_constantly_invading_our_subreddit/) (the top mod) and a number of people believed that at least one of the bans was unjust.  This number included the creator of r/metanarchism, dbzer0.

My basic message was that dbzer0 should have been well aware of the reported authoritarian and heavy-handed unilateral tendencies that many people have brought up over the past several months in regard to Skobrin's moderation.  And, by leaving Skobrin ALSO in charge of r/metanarchism (instead of just r/anarchism), he was plainly and overtly centralizing more power and control over both these subreddits into one users hands.  You can see this thread and dbzer0's denial of the obvious [in this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/o1RY1.jpg). 

Unfortunately, [my account was banned](http://i.imgur.com/IwmuK.jpg) (*from both of the subreddits in question*) and all my comments in the thread (despite being fairly clear and accurate) [were removed](http://i.imgur.com/J7CHD.jpg).  I was unable to respond to db0's last comment.  And, of course, it's standard procedure to be banned in both at the same time so that the persons being banned are unable to effectively protest or defend themselves against any spurious allegations.     

In any case, I thought some of you might get a kick out of these latest proceedings in the world of r/anarchism and I'd like to point out that the supposed anarchists moderating there, and concurrently in r/metanarchism, are not very representative of most anarchists that I've ever met throughout the years.  Most anarchists are not nearly as deceitful, venomous, or as ignorant as those pretending to be anarchists in their role as moderators on Reddit.  It's a shame, really.  

I should also note that, as of writing this, my posts have been restored, but my account has nevertheless been banned for offering nothing more than honest criticism.  And I think the issues with r/anarchism go far beyond me being banned or having my comments temporarily being banned.  The moderators of r/anarchism and r/metanarchism are the perfect blend of corruption and ineptness, unfortunately they've nevertheless wrested and maintained control of a subreddit dealing with profound subject matter.  Reddit isn't really a democracy in this regard.  Rather, instead, it's a matter of the first troll squatting a good keyword for a subreddit and then inviting all their friends and sockpuppets to have a party.  "	t5_2qh3y	True

It became one of the most revered posts in f7u12 history.  When mods removed it because it ""wasn't a comic,"" there was a massive backlash (which, incidentally, [I caused](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/m20sb/this_injustice_will_not_be_forgotten/))

Although the OP was never exposed as a fraud, it is almost certainly a fake, for the following reasons:

1. The OP made his account the day he posted the comic (claims to have been a redditor for a while). 
 
1. From the looks of the post, the OP is highly skilled with the rage builder (claims it is his first post). 
 
1. Never responded to address the many charges of fraud.
 
1. Come on!  An 86-year-old gamer redditor?   That would be Ron Paul in **TEN YEARS**.  There's no way.
 
1. Gives the vaguest description ever of the ""evils"" of war.


Also, take a look at the Yuli Daniel stuff at the beginning.  What's that doing there?  Very odd.  My analysis: Someone saw that it was Yuli Daniel's birthday, led to this idea.  And everyone (including me) completely bought it.

[tl;dr] some loser pretends to be 86-year-old gamer/redditor/rage-comic artist.... everyone buys it.  41K upvotes.
