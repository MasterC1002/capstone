I know this is a lot of text, so if you read it all you are a champion. I am just posting this for people that would just like a little insight. This is a REALLY ROUGH draft of what I am working on. I will add more links over time, and with the help of you guys add more to this post. This is how I see making clothing. We all don't have the same views, so I won't get butthurt if you disagree.











As I promised, here is a document that I hope can help people who want to start up their own independent clothing line. Sorry that it is a little late!

In this document I will try and cover different levels of clothing companies and also try to give you guys projected costs for starting a brand, or just making clothing as a hobby. 

A little intro, my name is Spencer. I am a mod of /r/streetwear and currently a first year at UCLA.  I have made some clothing in the past with a BUNCH of research and I am now going to give you guys all the resources that I have collected.  Hopefully the information that I provide can be of use to some of you guys. I am also going to write up the levels of clothing companies as I see them. Feel free to disagree with anything that I write. I just want to create an outline for people.

Levels of clothing companies
These are only things as seen through my eyes. Feel free to disagree.
(I will provide some links to the supplies that I am talking about at the end of the post).  

Remember this, you do not need a lot of money to establish a brand. These are just how I see it due to equipment, web costs, and the cost of producing clothing. You could be at any one of these levels with other amounts of money that funds your company. You could be at an intermediate level with $300 in your pocket. It all depends on how committed you are and how you use your money. Try and use it wisely!

Beginner: ($200 or lower)
	What I interpret this level as, is the person who makes shirts themselves in their house with low cost equipment. They make shirts in their free time and distribute them through their friends and family and really have no intention to expand and become a fully-fledged clothing company. You have an inexpensive press, screens, inks, and everything else you need to print shirts. Spreading your brand to others outside of your circle isn’t priority number one. 

Novice: ($200-400)
	You have some cool designs that you want to put on shirts. You have friends that would buy and support your company, but that’s not enough. You want to make an shopping site (maybe big cartel to start with) and you want to reach a larger audience. This is what I see as a step above beginner. You want to reach a larger audience than your friends, however you don’t have a large budget. Paired with an inexpensive press, shirts and hoodies can be printed. Everything is done by you, but in small batches because you don’t have a lot of money to create a collection from the start. Products are released whenever they can be, and there’s nothing wrong with that as a starting clothing line that’s all created by you. Don’t feel pressured to start with 5+ pieces if money is a concern. Just release high quality and genuine pieces as you can and focus on that later. 

Intermediate: ($400-1,500)
	This level is not as much of a side job, as it is a passion. At this level you are determined to create a brand and put a lot more time and money into it, and you want your company to reflect all of the work that you are putting into it. You can still print shirts yourself to avoid minimums from printers, but with a higher budget you can focus on designing and advertising as others produce clothing for you. This level is where there will be more variety in items as you have more money to put into the company. Maybe caps, beanies, hoodies, and shirts are made to kick off your clothing company. You could outsource work for caps and accessories to China if that’s what you want to do, and keep printing local. You have a lot more flexibility with a higher budget. 

Advanced: ($1,500+)
	This is going to be your job. You are more than determined to create a clothing brand and spread it into shops and hopefully open a physical storefront when you can afford it. There is a lot more clothing that is produced. Custom labels, hangtags, collaborations, and a LOT more variety in clothing. Seasonal collections that include more than a handful of items. All of your time is spent on your clothing company. At this point your eat, sleep, and breath your brand. I have not gotten close to being at this point, so anyone who has, please comment and we can edit this document with advice. 


Equipment and resources!

Here you will find equipment that is common in creating clothing and some links to places that will gladly produce clothing for you!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some items on this list is me assuming you want to do as much of if yourself. It’s all personal preference. I like to do as much myself as possible. I do the minor sewing, leather imprinting and such so that is why some of these supplies is included. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Manual silkscreen press.
-Squeegee for spreading ink across the screen.
-Spatula for the ink.
-Ink
-Heat gun to cure ink (only if you want to speed up the process).
-Silkscreens.
-Light box, emulsion, etc for creating a screen yourself. 
	-This is a lot more complicated if you are just working out of your house. I would recommend that you ask a local print shop if they would be willing to burn your design onto a screen of your choice for you instead. Saves time and it will be done right. Anthem screen-printing in San Francisco offers this service. 
-A basic sewing machine to sew on custom tags and such if that  is what you are planning. If you are putting tags onto cotton shirts, hoodies, etc, you won’t need anything expensive. 

For leather: I do all of my leatherwork myself. I make every leather logo that goes on my items so here is a list of what I use if this is something you want to do. There are other places to get these supplies, but here are some options. 

-Sharp x acto knife for cutting.
Just search for a high quality one. 

-Overstitch roller.
http://www.tandyleatherfactory.com/en-usd/home/department/tools/8091-00.aspx

-Stitching awl for making holes for the thread.
http://www.tandyleatherfactory.com/en-usd/home/department/tools/31218-01.aspx

-Leather stamp with your logo on it.

JGodfree	48	5	30	I think it's the format of most of the content we're posting, it's normally links to streetwear blogs or people asking where they can pick up a certain 5 panel whilst that's all well and good, I feel like anyone who's into streetwear is already familiar with at least one or two of said blogs, and google/ebay is your best bet for anyone looking for a specific item. I think what would maybe be a bit more interesting and would allow us to interact with each other a bit more personally (rather than just slagging off the latest supreme drop) is if we posted every piece we picked up, our collections and any original content/personal views, this would allow people to come across new brands (there are so many underground gems out there) and new pieces.

Who is Been Trill? Been Trill is a collective of artists featuring Matthew Williams, Virgil Abloh, Heron Preston, Justin Saunders, and YWP. They are artists, art directors, visual curators and designers first and DJs second.

 Their products consist mainly of hats and graphic tees, although they do have a few hoodies.

 The two most notable products of theirs have been the series of Hood By Air collaboration tees ( http://imgur.com/a/kMxuc ) and the 40oz NYC snapback which came in multiple colors (  http://imgur.com/a/lsgDz ). 


For more ideas of what their designs are check out their website ( beentrillbeentrill.com ), take a look at their Stussy collab  http://www.stussy.com/features/been-trill-for-stussy, or go to PacSun.com and check out their diamond colab tees and their PacSun exclue tees. Thats right, Been Trill announced that they would have exclusive tees at PacSun. The whole community exploded when this was announced. Most hated it. Others laughed. It went from spending $100 on a graphic tee printed on Gildan to $30 for a screenprinted tee made in America. It was a bold move on Been Trills part, and some of their fans took it as a slap in the face. Then to make things more dramatic, they announced a collaboration with Diamond Supply Co., which again would be PacSun exclusive. 


So what do you think of the brand? Good? Bad? Lame? Did they sell out? Do you like their designs or collabs? What do you think the future has for Been Trill?

I thought I would give you guys a look into my own clothing brand that I am relaunching called [Features Clothing Co](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Features-Clothing-Co/447154825349481?fref=ts)

It has been in the works for a while now after I changed my company name and I am proud to say I will be ready for release in the coming month if there are no more delays. A lot of work has gone into this upcoming release of my company so hopefully you guys appreciate it :)

Since I have posted about how to start up a brand I thought I would show the process here. 

Here are my fabrics: I have chosen to go with a spring critters theme for my first drop paired with a woodsy colored woven cloth. I hand sourced the printed fabric from a fabric retailer here in LA and as for the woven fabric, it was woven in Scotland for Features :)
http://imgur.com/gJ4goHE

Here is a close-up of the woven cloth:
http://imgur.com/tzTzyqL

Just picking a fabric isn't easy at all. I know I talked about stock fabrics in an earlier post, but sometimes you have to do it in order to ensure products. I have nothing against it. Now back to the process. It took me months to figure out what I wanted to do for my first drop from Features. In addition to selecting fabrics, they are relatively thin so I had to stiffen them. All of the fabrics I will be using are fused with interfacing to give a certain stiffness to them so they aren't flimsy. If you look at this picture you will see 40+ swatches of leather samples and a stack of about 30+ fabrics, and that's not even half of what I have here....
http://imgur.com/bqa1ARf

After finally determining your fabrics, you have to figure out what you're going to do for tags and a patch for the front panel. These can either pull your hat together, or look ridiculous on the hat. I began with wanting to do leather patches on the front, but due to complications I won't be using them for the first couple drops due to the leather. Here are pictures of the stamp I had created and what the finished product looked like:

The stamp:
http://imgur.com/JMfRY9s


The finished product:
http://imgur.com/3pJFwPF

These will be used in a future release with a thinner leather, but at the moment I don't have the finances to order a thinner leather :( So instead I have back-up woven labels that were meant for shirts, sweaters, and hats. 


Here is a picture of the sample label (the finals ones have less space between the image and edges).
http://imgur.com/znwWqhc



So these are the pieces that make up the hat, but what will the hat actually look like? I am not going through a factory and do as much of the work myself as I can. I then have someone put it together so it looks professional. In the pictures below the black hat is the first sample hat that was produced and the second hat is the one that I developed the pattern for and used some fabric I made a while ago. 

Here are the pics:
http://imgur.com/kPOkaq2
http://imgur.com/bnpGt93

You can notice the second hat has more of a shape to it. I fused the fabric so it would retain its shape. 

Of course there are some others things to consider when you are trying to start your own line. If you decide to go through a factory you can have them use their fabric or you just send yours and then you have a produced hat. There is nothing wrong with that but I chose a different approach.


The reasons I chose to get as involved in my hats as possible and have them made-to-order is simple. I want my company to release high quality clothing. Yes, setting up a pattern and doing a lot of the work cost a lot of money to setup, but to me it's worth it. Since this company is a representation of myself, I want to be as involved in the process of creation as I can :)

I will post some more updates as things get closer to release. I just wanted to show you guys what I have been doing.  Like everything, if you have any questions I will do my best to answer them :)



Cheers,

Spencer

BenPup	39	12	50	"Diamond Supply Co. is primarily known as a clothing company, but it originally started out as a skateboard hardware company making screws and bolts for trucks. With a good logo design though and the want to succeed, Diamond has become something that most brands dream of becoming.

Straight from the website:
Diamond Supply Co. was founded in 1998 when Nicholas Tershay (aka Nick Diamond) created a skateboarding hardware line from his humble one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco. In 2000, Nick moved to Los Angeles and began building Diamond Supply Co. in Mike Carroll &amp; Rick Howard’s legendary Girl Skateboards distribution house - soon growing Diamond Supply Co. to a full range of skateboard hard and soft goods, including bolts, bearings, t-shirts, fleece, accessories and more. Having a strong design aesthetic, and a commitment for creating high quality goods, Diamond Supply Co. was quickly embraced by skate and street fashion communities alike.

In 2005, Nike Skateboarding asked Nick to design his own signature Diamond Nike SB Dunk, which quickly became one of the most sought-after sneakers, and hailed as one of the greatest Nike SB’s of all-time by esteemed publications and collectors alike.

In 2006, Diamond Supply Co. opened its flagship doors in the historic Fairfax neighborhood in Los Angeles, and has remained a cultural staple since. Home to exclusive special releases, the shop is no stranger to lines that wrap around the block or the un-announced pro-skater, artist, or athlete, stopping by to pick up the latest releases.

In 2013, Diamond Supply Co. will open two more flagship locations. The first in Nick Tershay’s home of San Francisco and a second location in downtown New York City, in the heart of SoHo.

Diamond Supply Co. has an elite team roster of more than 100 of the best skateboarders in the World, from the likes of Paul Rodriguez, Eric Koston, Stevie Williams, Torey Pudwill, Nyjah Huston, and more.

Under Nick Tershay’s signature design and aesthetic, Diamond Supply Co. maintains a strong focus on delivering skateboarding goods with high integrity and matching quality, keeping true to its roots and remaining unchanged for over 15 years.

Whether a skateboarder, artist, designer, or athlete, anyone who pursues his or her dream, and makes that dream a reality represents the #DIAMONDLIFE

So how do you feel about Diamond? 

Do you like the designs?

Do you like the marketing?

Do you like the collaborations?

Please discuss below and remember, no senseless hate or praise. Please explain your opinion.

Please list what you're wearing from top to bottom and link to a picture of preferably you wearing the clothing. If you don't want to be in a picture then lay the clothing out on a table or the floor instead of like a bed or couch.

The best layout would be something like: Supreme / Levi / Nike, if you are wearing a supreme shirt, levi pants, and some nikes.

Once again please provide feedback on peoples fits and if someone really likes what you're wearing and wants a link please provide one or at least the name of the piece.

The winner gets a trip to LA to be mentored by Dyrdek and 10K to help start up the company. 

As a mod here, I know you guys are *always* getting accosted by promoters and offers from different brands but I'm hoping this brand will stand out enough to at least make it worth you checking it out. Plus all I'm really asking for is a few seconds to submit an email and click. I think my friend is super talented and all the guys we work with are really deserving of the kind of break winning this would provide. By voting you'll also be helping to put on a lot of other skateboarders, local designers and comic book artists that are apart of the Doom Squad! 

Below is a bio and the links for voting. I really appreciate you guys taking the time to read this and commenting and even more gratitude if you voted. 

Thanks for being an awesome community and as always, if anything or anyone gives you trouble in the sub, let me or the mods know!


Shirts and comics aren't available yet but will be soon after the concert ends. (Monday) 

**TL;DR: Rob Dyrdek is having a street wear contest, my boys at [DOOM UNITED](http://www.doomunited.com/) are in the final ten nominees and voting for us could put 10k in our pockets. Do your boy fuzz a favor and [vote for us!](http://www.ivivision.com/getbusyliving/#/vote)You know the heads up on that mishka sell helped you out. ;)**






&gt;Doom United is a company that merges a unique underground comic universe with clothing; it will produce a brand that has never been seen before. Doom United will not only produce clothing, but also a limited run of collectable action figures to accompany the comic book. Within the Doom United universe will consist of a league of villains content on world domination. These villains will be illustrated within the comic and also translated into designs to be worn on clothing. Doom United was created because we felt the t-shirt market was saturated with mass produced designs. Now, there will be very limited print runs of the designs; this way not everyone in the entire galaxy will have the same t-shirt design. We plan on using unique inks for some of our designs that glow in the dark. Some will also be activated by sunlight to reveal artwork that can't be seen indoors. To keep our designs fresh, we plan on hiring unique and talented artists with styles that may blow your mind.

I noticed there are quite a few people on this subreddit that have created their own clothing lines which is awesome! 

For people who have created clothing, or want to create their own clothing line, it is hard to start. There are large minimum order quantities that make everything almost unaffordable if you don't have a large budget, that is if you want to produce items such as hats and some embroidered goods. Or you can go the DIY way and print your own shirts, which takes practice. 

Whatever method people use to create their own clothes, I think it would be valuable to every clothing entrepreneur on this subreddit if we would be willing to help each other out with resources. Like names of manufacturers, fabric suppliers, equipment, or anything that is used to produce clothing.

For me it was frustrating trying to contact people asking for help with manufacturers and getting cussed out for trying to learn their manufacturing ""secrets"". I think hiding this information is bullshit as we should all have a chance to do what we love, and that is to create clothing. 


If anyone has any questions about manufacturers, or anything, feel free to reply to this post or message me directly. I have some knowledge that will hopefully help some of you guys :)

* [St. Alfred](http://www.stalfred.com/)- Probably Chicago's most famous sneakershop. St. Alfreds has indeed become a staple of Chicago streetwear. Their shop is not the biggest one you'll find but they have a nice variety of brands for both sneakers and streetwear. 

* [Leaders 1354]( http://www.leaders1354.com/)- Located near downtown Chicago, Leaders offers more affordable products in comparison to many other shops in the city. They have recently gained more popularity due to their endorsement of Chance the Rapper, who seems to rock their brand in almost all of his videos. 

* [Jugrnaut](http://www.jugrnaut.com/)- Jugrnaut is similar to Leaders in that is an affordable streetwear boutique that is heavily involved in the Chicago hiphop scene. Home of the famous Treated crown. 

* [Akin](http://akinchicago.com/)- More so a sneakershop than streetwear boutique, Akin offers their own brand of clothing as well as a wide variety of sneakers. They have two locations in the city for both the northsiders and the southsiders. 

* [Succezz](http://www.succezzthestore.com/)- Located on south Michigan Ave, Succezz is a streetwear shop with a huge Jordan account. The one time I went there I saw a dude rocking Air Mags so there's that. 

* [Sir &amp; Madame](http://www.sirandmadame.com/)- Perhaps a little more /r/mfa than /r/streetwear, Sir &amp; Madame lets you get your grown man on while still keeping it real. 

* [Uprise](http://www.upriseskateboards.com/)- By far Chicago's most famous skateshop, Uprise houses all of the hybrid street/skate brands such as Huf and Diamond Supply Co. They also have the best Nike SB account in the city if you're into that sort of thing. 

* [Belmont Army](http://www.belmontarmy.com/)- With two locations in the city, Belmont Army is without a doubt the biggest shop on this list. Just to put its size into perspective, the Belmont Ave. location has   separate floors dedicated to apparel, shoes, skate goods, and thrifted clothes.

1368585455.0	1ecxbh	My story of how I ran my clothing business for a month	OfficialDanek	30	7	27	"This is my story of how I had a dream of running my own little clothing store online, and failed.

First of all, running a small company is serious and has it's risks.

In order to make any sales at all, you need to know that you're a good artist*. Illustrator is usually the perfect software when making one or two or three color designs (will get in that a bit). Photoshop is usually for full color prints, which is extremely more expensive.

I wasn't a good drawer, neither did I know how to use Illustrator, so there were my problems. I was pretty good in computer graphic designing though through Photoshop, I always got A's on my projects in school, so I thought this should be easy!

Wrong.

First of all, setting up a website. Big Cartel or Wix are two possible options, but I went with Big Cartel because it was free.

Designing a logo, setting up descriptions, the company's goals, etc. was easy.

What wasn't easy is investing your own money into this. A big mistake that many small companies make is that they buy lots of inventory (let's say, 20 t-shirts for the price of $8 each), and then they don't make any sales, and have all those t-shirts laying around.

You just lost money.

I wasn't sure if I wanted to risk that, and I just started this, so I instead payed a huge price ($16 + $7) per t-shirt + shipping from Vistaprint since they were a company easy to work with and reputable. Another thing, my strategy was that once a person makes the order of a product from my website, I'll make the order from VistaPrint and have them ship the item directly to my customer. It was effective, but I didn't make much profit from it since my designs were **full print** and it was an order of only 1 t-shirt, rather if I would have ordered 5 or more, the price of per t-shirt would drop.

So I had a design of a t-shirt on my website, and I got a person from Kentucky and a person from Virginia that bought it! The t-shirt with shipping costed $30 total, and I was using PayPal, so if it costed $23 to make the t-shirt and ship it to the customer, I should be making $7 profit, right?

Nope, wrong, PayPal charges 4% out of every payment received, meaning I got $28.34 or something like that rather than a full $30.

Now, to the topic of printing.

A full print is when the design concludes of multiple colors, like for example, a colored picture of New York on a t-shirt is considered full print. And full print printing is very expensive.

When a one color print t-shirt design costs $4 per t-shirt, a full print t-shirt design costed $13-$18 per t-shirt (varies by companies). Big difference, right?

I was bad at drawing in general, so I thought about having a partner in on this who was a good artist, but profits were so little, and problems were arising of how I was going to advertise my company, and it was just really stressful when you don't know what you're doing.

It's complex and hard, not an easy process to go through, so I gave up on it.

I wouldn't this was a waste of time, because I did get to learn from this experience, and hopefully you'll learn something out of this too.

Since there are quite a few posts by people advertising their own independent brands, I was thinking we could compose a list of the brands started by people on this subreddit. I think we should help the brands started by members by promoting them on the sidebar, and if you have a launch date for a new collection or the launch date of your brand we could put the date next to the brand name.


There are currently 1,183 subscribers to this page so there could potentially be A LOT of indie brands out there. If we can get a list composed with websites and such, I was thinking we could have a rotation of the brands on the side every couple of days so that everyone could get some attention and to help out every brand as much as possible.
Let me know what you guys think of this!


ALSO,
A list/document of resources for people who want to create clothing is being composed. It won't have a whole lot to start with, but I am hoping that there are people on this page that would be willing to contribute more information.


Cheers,

Just be thankful for what you have and know it could all end in a second. Always do your best and when you look at your past you should be happy about every single thing that you've accomplished and have no regrets.  

Always put more then 100% into whatever you do. Fuck it. Put more than 200% into it. I feel like I have more motivation to do my absolute best now with my company and everything I do. 

Things like this make you thankful for what you have.

As I'm sure is the case with all of you, when I'm visiting another city on holiday, one of my highest priorities is to check out the local streetwear stores. Having just returned from a long weekend in Barcelona, I realised something is missing: a comprehensive guide to the locations of these stores. Me and my girlfriend used unlike city guides and Hypebeast's store guides to find stores but found stores weren't open any more and those that were still open, were almost impossible to find. All too often the store locations are just too hard to find even if you have the address. As such, I want your help. This week I will be starting an exhaustive guide to the locations of streetwear stores in central London and compiling it into a custom map on Google Maps. I urge everyone who has good knowledge of streetwear stores in their city to do the same and between us we can help others getting lost so much in our cities.

The guidelines I will be using when creating my guide are as follows:

    Include photos of store front

    Include photos of the side view of the store, showing the view down the street from their respective angles

    Mark location on custom Google Maps

    Include directions from the nearest subway/train station

    Mark landmarks on Google Maps so you know you're on track, include photos if possible

    Make instructions descriptive. For example, ""look at x store sign, on your right should be y and on your left should be z, now turn left..."" Think more like a video game tutorial than a guidebook

    Include brief descriptions of which brands etc. are stocked but remember this guide is primarily concerned with explaining locations of the stores.

    Date stamp whenever possible to keep the guide current. If a store closes down, mark it as closed instead of removing it from the map to avoid confusion.

Any suggestions on what can be added or changed to these guidelines to improve the quality of such a guide is welcomed"	t5_2sgoq	True

After it was over I got to shake Jeff's hand and talk about possibly interning at Staple Design after graduating college, all the while trying to avoid fanboying too hard. Me and my friend were the only highschool students (seniors) there, considering it was an event at Vandy but Jeff seemed to appreciate us going out to it. Bun B was also hella cool. They both were really humble and it was a day I'll never forget. The people hosting the event were rushing to get Jeff and B on their flight, so asking for a flick and an autograph was out of the question but they posed for one [group shot](http://i.imgur.com/UlAOWoE.jpg) (sorry for the shitty quality).

I got aware of the brand as a reddit user promoted the bigcartel site, including a still running offer. Buy one hat; get one free! So I checked them out and noticed in addition that the caps were on sale. As I live in Germany, of course I had to pay a higher than usual shipping sale anyways I only payed about 46 canadian $ for two dope hats.
The caps arrived within the following 2 weeks and I am very content with the outcome.

The first hat I ordered was the ""Whistler"" (already sold out). The cap has an [extremly dope print](http://i.imgur.com/iBiNTOZ.jpg) and came out [very well](http://i.imgur.com/kVXfy7g.jpg). Sadly it is a bit hard to pull off but it works with white or navy blue clothes.

The second hat I ordered (and got for free) is just called ""11"". 
I like it even more than the ""Whistler"" one because it's so simple but so tight. The Cap is plain black and got a [violet patterned brim](http://i.imgur.com/ZNDMu7G.jpg) &lt;-- sorry for the small pic you can see it [better on their website](http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91990982/max_h-1000+max_w-1000/4.1.JPG).

All in all the caps are awesome, the quality is great (not as good as HUF or Obey ones tho) and they fit well. The only thing I don't like that much is the [adjustment clip at the backsite](http://i.imgur.com/adZSy99.jpg) which swings free in the air. If you have a small head it turns out to get very long and there is no possibilty to hide it. But thats not that disturbing at all.

A friend of mine who ordered [another cap](http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91990346/max_h-1000+max_w-1000/3.1.JPG) from brightlights had the problem that the cap started to [wrinkle in the rain](http://i.imgur.com/5bEMwz5.jpg). The problem was solved as he dry aired the cap, anyways you should be carefull.

I'm bored as fuck in my lecture hall and am tired of listening to my teacher. 

So I feel like posting something I find mildly interesting.


What do you guys think about companies that use stock fabrics? Especially in the 5 panel game.

As I scour the internet every night for fabrics while slowly decaying in my chair dressed in a dirty wife beater and boxers, I come across companies everywhere that use very basic and easy to find fabrics. Some fabrics are so easy and cheap to find that companies will often times have the same fabric. What do you guys think about that?

This is mainly predominant in companies that manufacture 5 panel/camp hats (whatever you prefer). I can even say I am guilty of using such easily accessible fabrics. I won't deny it. As a small company that is solely funded by myself, how will I be able to fund such ventures that will include printing custom fabrics? With a small budget you are forced to look in the clearance sections of fabric outlets and websites, and often times someone out there will have already used that fabric or something similar. So what does that mean for the future of 5 panel caps? Also, how much work or thought can you really say went into the development of a hat? We all know that in reality we look around, buy fabric, send it to a manufacturer, and hazah! You have a hat. I know this is a VERY broad generalization, but think about it. I have respect for a lot of companies out there, but recently The Quiet Life released their Au Natural pack. If you know fabric and designers you could immediately tell that is a standard Alexander Henry fabric that you can buy for under $10 a yard. I found a link to buy it within a minute. 

http://www.modes4u.com/en/kawaii/p10304_Pin-up-women-in-nature-fabric-by-Alexander-Henry.html

I am in no way trying to bash companies, but I just wanted to bring this to attention. I just want to find out what you guys think is on store for the future of 5 panels. It seems they are starting to lose their aw factor as more fabrics arise that look so similar. I personally believe that making 5 panels is an art form and that's how it should be treated as, but how do you make it stand out with a stock fabric? As a majority of five panel caps are made in factories, how involved are we really as designers of these caps?

Maybe it's my lack of sleep over the last week that caused me to rant, but hopefully you have an opinion! 

My lecture is about to end so I will talk to you guys later.

Cheers,


Spencer

At present, I don't quite have any ideas on how to achieve this. Things I'm toying with are to change up what's on our side bar and feature YOUR brands. Any 2 cents you have would be greatly appreciated."	t5_2sgoq	True

I am a young entrepreneur and more ambitious than anyone I know. I hope you see that as a challenge because I am the type of person to push others around me. 

I started Kingdom at 19 years old and can be more thankful to have as much knowledge and experience as I do now at 21. I hope to inspire you all with some of the progression posts I share.

We haven't posted as much as we used to.  Just when we have new drops/deals.  To everyone who is hating, more love to you.  To all the smaller brands out there keep grinding and working towards your goals.  To the customers we did get from this sub, thank you all for rocking with us and I hope you enjoyed our service and the products we offer.

We offer discounts and etc, and people still hate.  At the end of the day it's alright though.  What we sell isn't for everyone, but if you want to complain about us posting, you better do the same with every other brand/site that does it also.  This isn't about profits to me, this is a side job.  This is about bringing REAL streetwear to people.  Independent, real shit to people, without charging high prices.  When we first came here the sub loved it!  We came out the gate throwing discounts, but hey it's all good.  I want to thank everyone on this sub and the mods!  I really think this sub is to mainstream (at times).  We are done here.  

Again,  big thanks to everyone who supported the movement! For those who supported the movement take 30% off using code FRSW.

I'm gonna try to balance out making this a more personal post than most new brand promotion posts, against writing a wall of text. I'm a 33 year native New Yorker living in Brooklyn. I've always loved jackets. I started collecting jackets in High School, and I've been collecting ever since. Three years ago I decided to make my own jackets, but having no educational or professional background in design or manufacturing, not to mention being pretty much broke, it seemed like a pipe dream. After dealing with some personal shit in my life that was kind of holding me back, I'm finally ready to begin working on samples for my first collection, which will hopefully drop in the F/W 2014 season. I've worked with a graphic designer to create an original camo print that I want to use for inner linings and trim, I've got all the materials and hardware, found a pattern-maker and I believe a factory to turn out my samples. As for aesthetic and quality, I'm aiming to be an American Answer to Japanese brands like Junya Watanabe Comme Des Garcons, Sophnet, and Visvim.

 In order to get my feet wet, and to get my name and camo print out there, I collaborated on a t-shirt with my friends over at DC based brand, Borgata DC. 

Here are some pics:

[Bonus: Back w/ 3M Reflecting](http://www.borgatadc.com/borgata-dc-springsummer-2013-lookbook/?pid=113)

The T-Shirt features a cotton twill bar of my original camo print on the front, screen print of my script logo on the sleeve, and the logos of Brogata DC, and my brand, Artillery Concern, in 3M Reflective material on the back.

You can buy it [Here](http://www.borgatadc.com/borgata-dc-x-artilery-concern-bar-tee/) for $40.

I made an Etsy site for it and posted on here asking for advice and just feedback in general, which everyone was more than willing to give. After a month of tweaks and adjustments, I have finally put together a small site to display my products. Well without further adieu, here it is! Hope you guys like my products and of course, any feedback is greatly appreciated. I know it's only pocket tee's and a cuff print tee, but I plan on learning how to screen print some of my own designs. Hopefully that happens within the next 2 months, I've been studying for the GRE that I'm about to take in 3 weeks. Alright, rant over.

 I don't really dress that way at all but I've always loved it. 

But do you guys think as you get older your style will change and deviate from a street wear style to, dare I say, a more professional look? (not sure if professional is what I mean to say)

Or to put it another way is there an age cap on street wear? 

Will you be 70 and still rockin' the same Supreme Tee and Bape hoodie (or whatever brand happens to be hyped at that moment)?

Or can street wear be molded to the age of the wearer?

Found this subreddit the other day while on my other account, I should have known there would be a reddit for streetwear. Anyways, a friend and I are starting up a clothing line and are in the process of finding someone who can do logo work (for pay obviously) and has an interest in the streetwear culture or has even worked in the industry. I know there is a Graphic Design For Hire subreddit, but it's difficult to go through portfolios and only see logos that were created for lawyers, auto shops, etc. and know that a person would be able to come up with something that is of more of a niche market.

-----

I've been really admiring the whole streetwear culture and scene for awhile now, but never really knew how to go about starting a wardrobe based on it (it was time for me to get some new clothes as I've outgrown most of my old ones now).

Was researching online a few weeks go for streetwear stores in Melbourne since I was going on holiday there and saw that [The Sure! Store](http://thesurestore.com) was one of the more well-known ones in Melbourne.

I managed to check the store out today and was extremely excited when I was finally able to see brands like 10 Deep and HUF (both of which brands I really love the style of) right in front of my eyes :D

Thought I should spoil myself a little bit, since I'm already here and may as well splash out a little bit more for something I'll be wearing often anyway.

These are the stuff I bought, including 2x 5 panel hats for my younger brother who has been really interested in what I've been checking out recently as well, what do you think?!

I'm not looking for some ultra-spacious, indestructible backpack (I'd buy a surplus army pack if I needed that), just something that can carry my stuff around and not fall apart (bonus if it has laptop-protection).

What are some good streetwear brands that put out quality backpacks? I see [Herschel](http://i.imgur.com/F5QZnno.jpg) constantly, but are they quality or just flavor-of-the-month/trendy? I've also read about/seen a brand called [Fjallraven](http://i.imgur.com/w0iaGBF.png) that make bags, but apparently they've sourced their manufacturing to Vietnam as opposed to Sweden which may or may not be a good thing.

Thoughts/opinions anyone? Links or input would be very much appreciated."	t5_2sgoq	True

I've recently approved of the final sample for a baseball cap that I had made with Ebbets. Here is a cell phone pic (better ones coming soon) http://imgur.com/F73VHzr

I would ideally place the order for all of the caps by myself and just release them to the public, but due to some complications with college I had to dip into my company fund in order to stay at my university since that is my priority. I can't even afford the final samples for my camp hats :/

Due to this I won't be able to fund the production of my hats that I've spent so much time working on. I've thought of things such as kick starter but as a full time student who also has a job I am worried I won't be able to fulfill the gifts for donators in a timely fashion. I want to be able to guarantee a product in a timely fashion. 

I plan on retailing these hats for ~$46usd. The only thing is that I would need a certain amount of pre-orders to order the run of caps since there is a minimum. 


So the question is, if I open pre-orders, who would like to support Features Clothing Co? If enough people would like to support an up and coming quality hat company just let me know :) If I get enough feedback I will open pre-orders on my site! 

Thanks for reading,

Spencer

1375841614.0	1jut87	/r/Streetwear News: Introducing Flair for Confirmed Sellers	dirtyrobot	6	3	5	"In an effort to improve the sub we're introducing a new flair system for confirmed sales. We're going to be teaming up with /r/supremeclothing for this, so flair and confirmed sales with be shared across the 2 subreddits. 

How it works is pretty simple: If you make a sale here, request the buyer to message the mods with a photograph showing the item in hand and including a link to the sale post. You must include a photo for it to count and it must come from the buyer. 

For the time being there are only 2 levels of flair. If this takes off and we need greater differentiation we'll expand the flair selection. So, any confirmed sale will get the blue flair (that I currently have on my name) and at 5 confirmed sales you'll get gold flair. This follows the same system that is currently in place in /r/supremeclothing, the only difference is that they use the Supreme ""S"" instead of a dot. 

If you've sold items on /r/streetwear in the past, those sales are eligible so long as the buyer provides a photo and a link back to your sale post.  

Let me know if you have any questions or if I've overlooked anything.

Its purpose is to motivate, inspire and empower people to chase their dreams while striving to find balance in life to ensure success in the foreseeable long-run. 

What is FP? 
FP is influenced by our everyday life; music, skating, street fashion, attitude, parties, drugs, girls, alcohol, etc... Anything goes. FP derives from the previous original name, Flying Packs. Flying Packs stems from the idea of chasing a dream. Working in the industry of package transportation I’ve seen and heard of several exotic and interesting things get shipped away to different states and countries. A Flying Pack has a start point, a route, and a final destination; Similar to having an idea, an execution plan and finally accomplishing your goal. Just like a Flying Pack. 

 What is LR?
 LR stands for LongRun. ""We are in it for the long run"". LongRun represents an accomplishment over time and a literal meaning of being active/healthy. 

The equals sign, ""="" is placed in-between both words to represent that one is not better than the other, instead they are both necessary and a balance of both is highly desirable.

1365631124.0	1c3cjy	An exhaustive guide to the locations of streetwear stores in major cities	Dannah573	4	0	0	"As I'm sure is the case with all of you, when I'm visiting another city on holiday, one of my highest priorities is to check out the local streetwear stores. Having just returned from a long weekend in Barcelona, I realised something is missing: a comprehensive guide to the locations of these stores. Me and my girlfriend used unlike city guides and Hypebeast's store guides to find stores but found stores weren't open any more and those that were still open, were almost impossible to find. All too often the store locations are just too hard to find even if you have the address. As such, I want your help. This week I will be starting an exhaustive guide to the locations of streetwear stores in central London and compiling it into a custom map on Google Maps. I urge everyone who has good knowledge of streetwear stores in their city to do the same and between us we can help others getting lost so much in our cities.

The guidelines I will be using when creating my guide are as follows:

* Include photos of store front

* Include photos of the side view of the store, showing the view down the street from their respective angles

* Mark location on custom Google Maps

* Include directions from the nearest subway/train station

* Mark landmarks on Google Maps so you know you're on track, include photos if possible

* Make instructions descriptive. For example, ""*look at x store sign, on your right should be y and on your left should be z, now turn left..*."" Think more like a video game tutorial than a guidebook
* Include brief descriptions of which brands etc. are stocked but remember this guide is primarily concerned with explaining locations of the stores.

* Date stamp whenever possible to keep the guide current. If a store closes down, mark it as closed instead of removing it from the map to avoid confusion.

**Any suggestions on what can be added or changed to these guidelines to improve the quality of such a guide is welcomed**

I live in bumfuck Finland and my town doesn't really have a proper store to try on streetwear brand t-shirts (we have like H&amp;M and other generic clothing stores) and ordering from the US/elsewhere just to try shirts on is really expensive so I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions for brands to check out? 

As an example, I've got an M [Adidas Originals x Star Wars](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.svpply.com/large/924185.jpg) Tee, which is imo fine shoulder width-wise (If you ask the fellas over at /r/malefashionadvice they'll probably still say too small), but the length is just too long and I feel like I'm a lady wearing one of those large Tee/dress hybrids. 

An M sized Tee from Apliiq.com I have is way closer to the desired fit. Delivery from Apliiq is almost $50, though, so I'd like to find something that doesn't require me to commit +$100 every time I want a new T-shirt.

Any suggestions appreciated :)

I obviously don't want to start putting up ads and stuff or throwing an open 'launch party', I want to reach new potential fans without giving off the impression that I'm trying to get to anyone and everyone. I've launched the brand in Egypt and streetwear culture doesn't really exist here. Any tips on how I can go about it? Any insight would be appreciated.
Also, if anyone's interested this is the brand www.krakbaby.com (we're only in Egypt but we can handle international orders on a case by case basis) :)

Hell, I'll go for the white floral. 

Woke up in time to make purchase, card input fucked up so I checked to see of it was in stock and it was. So I tried again, same problem! Tried 2 more times and then it sold out.  Went for the white one but then it sold out. 

Card magically worked when I went to buy the Panama snapback (which I wanted and was available in the color I wanted, just put off buying it for another companies 5 panel). 

Yeah, that's my frustrated rant but anyways if anyone could help me out I would really appreciate it and try to hook it up for you with something.

1376879845.0	1kn4ej	A service I'm thinking of offering (custom hats of all kinds)	sashankle	5	3	4	"So I haven't been too active lately due to working almost 24/7 and also working on some side projects. 

What I've been working on is setting up a way to allow people to create custom caps (I know it's something that isn't too hard to find online). These caps would be competitively priced and there would be options for five panels, snapbacks, six panels, fitteds, and more in the future. It would start out with fabric that you can send in or pay a little extra to have a fabric designed just for you. 

My goal isn't to make a lot of money off of this, but to just offer a service that will deliver a cap of amazing quality that's also handmade in the US (there will be no factories involved).

The main reason I want to do this is because I've had a lot of disappointing experiences with custom cap companies and also had POOR customer service when it came to communication. I don't want others to experience that. 

I am also thinking of offering a service that will allow small clothing companies to manufacture caps through me with no MOQ (minimum order quantity for people who don't know). Of course the pricing would go down when more hats are ordered. This would just be an alternative to buying 50 caps of one design at a time. 

Let me know what you guys think. I am working on getting just blank caps made of each model that I would offer and I am working on a site as well.
