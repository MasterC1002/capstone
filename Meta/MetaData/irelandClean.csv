Can someone drink a pint there tomorrow for me? I am good for the funds, and will pay a the sum of a few pints (and/or reddit gold) in return for any credible photographic evidence of the act.

Very thankful to be a part of all of it. If it's not too rude, I'd love to talk to all of yous about whatever's going on with our part of the world. I currently live in Texas, so, please, fire any questions you may have about a yank's view of how we live, or my views on whats going on over here. Anything really, comic nonsense, all that. Any shite like that, that'd be lovely. Fire away!

I did an AMA within Reddit before, and that was great, but I'd love to talk to the fellas from back home about stuff. Hence why I'm posting this. Simple as that, really. 

Edit: If I don't initially respond, it's because I'm 6 hours behind you. Promise though, I'll answer all of your questions. Pose a question, I swear I'll answer when I wake the fuck up.

**EDIT: I'm back on. If any of my answers didn't make sense last night, blame the Harp. Reading back on them, some of them really don't. Sorry.

NOTE: If any Irish ones are around Dallas, TX or live in Dallas, hit me up. I need to find some Irish folk in this town.**

As a young guy in his 20 somethings, I can't swing a pint glass without running into at least a half dozen Irish folk. Much though we whinge about the poms down here, you lot are always welcome ~ not only does it lift the tone in terms of liveliness and good humor, but the increase in friendliness, collective complaints about the ~~rest of the UK~~ **collective stereotypes that your neighbours unashamedly fulfil - cheers @ thejmii for that faux pas** &amp; generosity makes every weekend (and weekday) a blast.

Edit: Tl:DR ~ you're politer than the Aussies, better educated than the Americans, better looking than the ~~British~~ **English** and less criminal than the Scots.

Edit 2: Also, fuck the Welsh.

Edit 3: Anything I've missed there?

I took the Dart out to Howth and went in to a small bike shop where two of the employees sent me out on a 'cliff run' right beside the ocean. It was one of the most scenic runs I'd ever been on. ([Pic](http://imgur.com/oTlXtzp)) 

I accidentally went to far, and ended up in a small town, somewhere between Sutton and Howth. I'd been going for awhile and was starting to get tired, so asked an older couple who were walking along the road for directions. They pointed me towards the Sutton train station, about 5km down the road. As I started away again, my foot started to really hurt. After another couple kms, I couldn't run anymore. I thought I was getting close to Sutton, so kept walking along the road. Half an hour after meeting them, the couple I spoke to on the side of the road pulled up in a car beside me and offered to drive me to the station. The man had been a runner when he was younger and saw me favouring my foot when I left them earlier. Turns out he had a daughter in Canada (where I'm from). 

I rode back on the train and couldn't stop smiling. Can't wait to get back out there. 

TL;DR - Sent on a great trail run from Howth, got lost and tired, saved by friendly locals. "	t5_2qhb9	True

Ten days ago, I left the United States with my school band. We took a tour of Dublin, Galway, and Kerry, and on Sunday we marched in the St. Patrick's Day parade in Dublin. 

I'd just like to say that Ireland is the most amazing place I've ever been. In fact, the only bad part is that I have to go back today. I love everything about this beautiful island. I love the architecture, I love the countryside, I even love the freezing, sunless climate. I spent last night looking at Irish universities because I can't wait to come back. 

I'd like to thank all of the kind people I've met here. This has been the best experience of my life.

As a graduation present my folks surprised me with a trip to Ireland. My dad graduated from notre dame so we went for the emerald isle classic and spent the rest of the week sightseeing in Dublin, Galway, Kilarney, and Kilkenny. I just wanted to say thank you to all of you because we had the most unbelievable time! We got my great grandmothers birth certificate in Dublin and learning about the history of Ireland was something I will cherish for the rest of my life. Everyone was warm and inviting and I felt a special connection with Galway because I am half Irish and half Spanish :p Anyways, we felt very welcomed and I wanted to say thank you to all of you and will hopefully come visit again soon!	t5_2qhb9	True

I'm sick to the teeth of being treated like a child when it comes to drinking on Good Friday. I think it would be a lot more convenient for everybody if only Christians were bound by this particular law. Maybe atheists and people from other faiths could have the option of carrying an ID card which states their religious status, enabling them to purchase their beverages of choice whenever they damn well please. It's a radical and impractical idea, but it's a radical and impractical law. If some people believe it is wrong to drink on this particular holy day, then they can abstain all they like - that's the beauty of personal freedom. But it strikes me as arrogant and unfair to inflict these beliefs on everybody. It might have been all well and good when the entire country was Catholic/Protestant, but it is now 2012, and it's time to move on. Curious about other people's opinions on this.	t5_2qhb9	True

From the Press release I got:

&gt; **Tourism Ireland invites Canadian couple behind viral video to Ireland**

&gt; 12 August 2013 – The Canadian couple who created a viral video hit during their recent honeymoon in Ireland – which has been seen online by almost 140,000 people around the world – will make a return visit to Ireland, courtesy of Tourism Ireland and Air Canada rouge.
 
&gt; Stephen and Shannon Parker, makers and stars of the viral video “A Fortnight Plus Half – An Ireland Adventure”, have been invited by Tourism Ireland and Air Canada rouge to return here to continue their Ireland adventure. 

&gt; The video, recorded in just under three weeks during Stephen and Shannon’s honeymoon in Ireland in May, has been viewed almost 140,000 times since it was first posted online, with people from Ireland, Canada, the US, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa – and even as far away as Botswana – going online to watch their lauded 19-minute travel diary.
 
&gt; The couple recorded over 16 hours of footage in Ireland during their three-week trip; then edited it to create a wonderful montage that quickly went viral. The end result is a 19-minute video documenting their 2,653-km journey around the island – taking in Dublin, Belfast, as well as counties Antrim, Derry, Galway, Clare, Kerry, Cork, Waterford, Tipperary and Wicklow. 

&gt; It features fabulous footage of architecture; spectacular coastline, waterfalls and mountains; traditional music sessions; and even lots of sheep running on the road alongside their car! It also incorporates footage of mouth-watering food – including lots of seafood (and oyster-tasting), Irish cheeses, brown bread and a full Irish breakfast! The challenge of navigating in a foreign country and driving on the ‘wrong’ side of the road also features!
 
&gt; Tourism Ireland has been sharing the video through its social media platforms – including through Facebook and Twitter. Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: “We are delighted to invite Stephen and Shannon to Ireland, to express our sincere thanks to them for sharing their Ireland honeymoon video online. Their video is a superb showcase of the island of Ireland – from the dramatic beauty of places like the Giant’s Causeway and Connemara National Park, to the rich history of our heritage properties like Dunluce Castle and Dunguaire Castle – which also manages to convey the friendliness and the warm welcome people receive when they come here. It’s a fantastic compilation of some of the very best things to do on holiday in Ireland, which will surely inspire other travellers around the world to come and experience the destination for themselves.”
 
&gt; Both from Toronto, Stephen and Shannon’s families have strong connections with the island of Ireland and can trace their ancestors back here. Shannon’s family come from Limavady in Northern Ireland, while Stephen’s hail from Dublin. As seen in the video, the pair visited Shannon’s family’s farm during their honeymoon; however, Stephen hasn’t yet explored his family heritage. 

&gt; Tourism Ireland will help Stephen trace his roots here, in advance of the couple’s next visit to the island of Ireland."	t5_2qhb9	True

So I've got some news.  The support I, and my mam, have received from Ireland has been really great.  In the mail recently she got an awesome package from [Minority_of_One](http://www.reddit.com/user/Minority_of_One) (I think) which contained some bits of the homeland.  It had shamrock seeds, a bog cat (very reddit of you btw,) and a heartfelt card which included a Mass in Dublin where my mother will be prayed for.  The last bit put my mam in tears over the phone.  [Here](http://imgur.com/LTRIX) is a pic of my mam holding the heartfelt gifts.  Also [trevvr](http://www.reddit.com/user/trevvr) posted a slideshow, [found here](http://imgur.com/a/QGpHR#0) of his home near the Shannon river, my mother was ecstatic to see these.  Someone also sent my mam a youtube playlist, [here](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL36500A670EB35142), she thoroughly enjoyed the show; unfortunately the chap that posted it deleted his name, so I must forgo a proper thank you.

GOOD NEWS.  My mother just went to her first scan after chemo.  She has had considerable shrinkage in all of her tumors, some have even disappeared.  Her blood markers for cancer went from over 5500 to under 250.  Her initial prognosis of 3 months has been extended to well over a year.  I call it the luck of the Irish.  Between the folks in Ireland and the family back home, my mam has been on cloud 9.  

I really cant express me and my families gratitude to everyone here.  It means a great deal.  

Thank you so much, and I will keep you updated.

By now, most of you are aware of the current meteorological situation that our country finds itself in. I have been told that many of you have been wandering the streets, staring into the sky in dismay and disbelief. I would like to speak to you tonight, to reassure you that Fine Gael are here to help you through this trying and troubling time for our nation. At my request, your government, Fine Gael, have prepared a 5 point plan to demonstrate my leadership in this time of crisis.

* Point 1: I will begin immediate negotiations with my counterparts in Europe, many of whom have faced this situation in the past. I am confident that with my negotiation and leadership skills I can secure orders from the EU that will help us through this crisis. I assure you all that when Europe tells me what to do, I will then in turn tell each and every one of you what to do, and will continue to do so until you all do what Europe tells you to.
Through no fault of Fine Gael, we have been led into this situation, because the previous government failed to deliver Europe's message to you the people, but under my government things will be different, and by doing the things that Fine Gael tells you that Europe wants we can restore this island to light rain with the occasional bit of sun poking through the clouds.


* Point 2: My team of ministers, under my leadership, has voted to send Joan Burton to the shop for ice-creams. Eamon Gilmore has requested a Cornetto. Pat Rabbitte has asked for a choc-ice, calling it the chosen ice-cream of the working man. Ruairi Quinn requested a feast for the mind, by which I assume he mean a Mint Feast. Michael Noonan has asked if they still make Fat Frogs, we have commissioned a team of highly paid consultants to investigate this, and I can assure you that the conclusions of this report will be made available to you in the fullness of time. Leo Varadkar could not decide which ice-cream he wanted, and will instead take a bite of everybody else's.
I want you all to rest assured that under my leadership, your cabinet will be remaining cool and fresh in the days to come.

* Point 3: Fine Gael, Fine Gael, Fine Gael, Fine Gael, Fine Gael, Fine Gael, Fine Gael, Fine Gael, Fine Gael, Fine Gael, Fine Gael, Fine Gael, Fine Gael, Fine Gael, Fine Gael, Fine Gael, Fine Gael, Fine Gael, Fine Gael, Fine Gael, Fine Gael, Fine Gael. Fine Gael.

* Point 4: It has been made clear to us that the current sun and temperature can be extremely damaging to the nation's cheese supplies, causing it to sweat and become yucky. This is something which effects every man, woman and child in this country. Under my leadership, this government will not stand idly by and allow this to happen. At my direction, the goverment has procured a stockpile of the best [sun protectors](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Cocktail_umbrella_side.jpg/220px-Cocktail_umbrella_side.jpg) available to safeguard our countries supply of cheese. There are 12 available, and these will be distributed on a first-come-first-served basis.

* Point 5: Lastly, I urge you all to stock up on wellies because it's guaranteed to rain for the next 3 months.

**VIOLIN : Bela vaci / cdm-r**

**BOW : Wanka**

**Vn CASE : Eastman / shiny light green hard case**

These aren't hugely expensive instruments on the scale of things but have *massive* sentimental value.

She's been teaching the Sing out with Strings programme in schools in Limerick for years and really puts her heart and soul into helping the kids in Limerick. Now some scumbag has stolen her pride &amp; joy. 

Spread the word as far as you can, if you know anyone who could possibly be offered the item then please show them this!

Thanks
