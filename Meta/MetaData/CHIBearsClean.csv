1349183859.0	10tbvc	Jay Cutler might be the greatest Quarterback of all time.	smilewithguile	512	114	62	"Jay Cutler is absolutely ridiculous, he torched Dallas' defense. It was so ridiculous, a couple steps dropping back and he's flinging it out immediately downfield. No offense line blocking? No fuckin' problem, all it takes is a flick, regardless of if its off the back foot. You are guaranteed a 20 yard pass with a Cutler to Marshall hookup.

Who needs help from the defense when your offense isn't even struggling to score? It is quite simple when you are lead by a beast of a quarterback named Jay Cutler. Can you believe it was so simple to give up that bum Kyle Orton and some picks just to get Cutler! And Orton doesn't even start in Dallas!

Cutler is not only the greatest QB ever to play, but what other Quarterback has to deal with Type 1 Diabetes in addition to throwing a good game? Finally the Bears got him a good receiver and what happens? Cutler goes off, finding him on every quick strike, ignoring the blitzes, as it didn't affect him. Mike Tice finally giving Cutler control definitely turned things around as Cutler went off on the Dallas defense.

No passing touchdowns scored on Dallas? Check again, Cutler sliced up that defense too, it's on to the next one. Cutler doesn't pay any mind to the haters, yeah he hurt his hand when he fumbled, but he came right back out and kept on playing.

Who needs Forte healthy when you have this kid throwing the ball down the field? Setting his feet, fuck that, he'll throw of his back feet with a smile on his face and still torch your defense. Pressure doesn't phase him, a little flick from his rocket and he's loaded up to Brandon Marshall down field.


A couple of strikes and he's got Rob Ryan screaming at the refs. Jay Cutler don't give a fuck, he knows he can carry his team to a win regardless of what Rob Ryan thinks. It wasn't pass interference? Well who cares, a field goal still wins us the game, easily. The game is over? Cutler don't give a fuck, another touchdown for Brandon Marshall. Next time, send more of a challenge if you really want a legitimate struggle out of Cutler, he's too much of a beast to be phased.
Explain to me why he was ranked behind Leinart and Young yet his career has already been more successful than both of them? He's an absolute monster, torching defense after defense. The only team he lost to isn't even leading the division.
Cutler is carrying the Bears back to the playoffs..

1354366880.0	143nxq	Good Guy Peanut Tillman	twentysixtwo	237	31	43	"Nobody bought me anything but I remember like it was yesterday:


In 2004, I was a high school senior working at a north suburban movie theater. The Bears season had just ended about 2-3 weeks prior and one afternoon, Peanut walks in with his wife/gf and buys tickets from the other box office rep, who had no idea of who he was. Tillman had just completed his rookie season. I remember asking my boss if I could go on break a little early, to which he obliged. 


Tillman and his partner were sitting on a bench chatting and they both caught me staring at them. Tillman actually waved his hand and said ""Come over here man! What's up?"" I said ""I'm really sorry to be rude, but are you Charles The Peanut Tillman?"" His partner almost shat herself laughing and Tillman said ""YEEAAHH! I'm da Peanut! Sit down, man!""


All 3 of us proceeded to have a conversation for the next 10 minutes. After he asked me to sit down, he asked me what my name was and if I was a real Bears fan. I then proceeded to name off about 14 of my favorite former Bears and talked about how I hated John Shoop's offense, which he and his partner got a real kick out of. I told him that the coolest thing I had seen since becoming a Bears fan was seeing him rip away the jump ball in the end zone from Randy Moss, sorely denting the Vikings' chances of qualifying for the postseason. I told him I thought he was awesome for graduating early from college in 3 years. His partner said I would be able to do the same if I continued to work hard, stay in school, and be responsible. (Graduated in 3 years too btw). He asked me about my job, my family, and what my favorite subjects were in school. I told him that I didn't want them to be late for their movie but before they left, Tillman offered to sign something for me and I just gave him a little movie theater envelope to autograph. The last thing he said before going to his movie was ""You're a smart guy _____. Stay in school man, it was great chatting with you."" After his movie finished, he passed by my kiosk and high-fived me before leaving.


While it doesn't often come up, I have always told this story to anyone who has ever asked about meeting public figures. Charles Tillman is by far the nicest, most down-to-earth public figure I have ever met. It may have been easy for a player coming off a promising rookie season to blow me off completely but he seemed genuinely surprised and humbled that I recognized him. He was gracious with his time and was engaged in the conversation, not once taking his attention away from myself or his partner. His charitable endeavors, his 100% effort on the field, and his humility really make him one of the great guys of the NFL. The signed envelope is at home at my parent's house and I will post it once I find it. I'm hoping that others have great stories to share about Peanut as well.


Bear down, #33.

###RULES

* **Restrictions**: We're going to have to be very trusting of one-another, like last year when there was no limit. I'm going to draw the line at 'redditors for more than a month' - if your account was created less than a month ago you'll have to sit this one out.

* **Budget**: Minimum purchase value of $20. If you can't afford a $20 gift for another Superfan you'll also have to sit this one out. No maximum but let's not go overboard and make the others jealous, people.

* **Time-frame**: I will stop accepting members that want to participate by **5:00pm (CST) Wednesday, November 14th**. If you don't get your info to me by then ya missed it. By the end of the week I will have matched everyone up and will respond via email (and maybe PM as well to be sure) to each of you with the username, name, and address of the ChiBears redditor to whom you will be sending your gift. So keep an eye on your email/orangereds on Friday November 16.

---

So the way it'll go is this: make a comment in this thread if you are interested. Then go ahead and email me your real name and address to **redditpipesale@gmail.com** - it's a throwaway account I made to unload some items I acquired when my company closed down- and *please* make the subject line ""**CHIBEARS SS: &lt;your user name&gt;**"" for the sake of my sanity. I'm not a spreadsheet wizard by any means, damnit. :D

I think that's the long and short of it. 

Also, whoever draws p-i-p can't send him anthrax.

###&gt; Turner

Also please upvote this. We have lots of asshole tourists right now and it's already been downvoted.

**edit: Also, gifts should be Bears related but don't necessarily have to be**

My grandfather was the greatest man I have ever known. He taught me everything about being a man. He was also a die hard bears fan. Never missed a game in 60 years. He took me to Soldier for the first time when I was 5. Taught me Everything about football and the bears. I remember every second of it. It was so important to me. I was so privileged that he wanted to take ME. It was in December, I had plastic bags tied around my feet, we sat up in the nose bleeds, it was against Seattle. We won. After that day, I was a bears fan for life. We talked about it every week during the season. He used to work at Soldier Field during the 85-87' seasons. Yes, he was on the field for the Super Bowl. Yes, He talked with Ditka everyday. He was security for the field &amp; Ditka. I have a newspaper article picture of him at the endzone with Walter Payton almost upside down diving in. He was there. Something I was so jealous of, that he saw our team at the greatest it's ever been. Not  on T.V., but live. As I got older, the bond grew stronger. Every family event, every holiday, I sat as close as I could to him, not letting him out of hearing range, in case he said something important that I would NOT want to miss. As I started to work and go through college, He would always tell me how proud of me he was, yet never straying far away from the topic of the bears, the good ole' days, the organization now, and what needs to happen. Every so often, he would scrounge up enough money for some tickets and we would go. Win or Lose, those were the best days of my life. 

He passed away this Easter. I was the one who found him when I went to pick him up. I was alone because we were going to talk bears before we left for my aunts....Hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
 
At the funeral a couple of past bears players had written letters to him saying how great of a person he was and how they will all miss him. My favorite was Garret Wolfe wrote him a very personalized letter. They had communicated for a while because my grandfather also played for NIU and was close to the organization plus the bears connection. Garret Wolfe had written a previous letter and had given my grandfather a signed NIU sweatshirt. My grandfather had made a display for it. It was at the wake. Many people love and adored him. He wrote in his will that he wanted all the cousins (over 21 and very close) to take shots and sing ""bear down"" at least once. We did with tears in our eyes.

About a couple weeks ago, I got a letter that he had given me some money. Not a lot. But he wrote, he wanted me to spend it doing something that I love and that He would love, but wouldn't be able to afford really ever.

Sunday. Packers. 8th row on Soldier. If anyone else is goin, take a drink, or a shot for him. He would of done the same for you. 

**Bear down, Pa. Bear down.**



TLDR; My grandfather paid for me to see the bears one last time.

*Edit:* thanks guys, it means a lot. p.s. I will be wearing this [Jacket](http://i.imgur.com/XxtHy.jpg), Sunday."	t5_2s0u3	True

But he does try and he has every right to yell at anyone on his offence because he is our QB and the fact that he wants us to win so bad that he's getting angry at people who aren't stepping up actually makes me happy.

He was in a bind 'cos he was way behind and he was willin' to make a deal.

When he came across this Bears Defender causin' fumbles and playin' so hot.

And Carroll threw a challenge flag and said: ""Homey let me tell you what:

""I guess you didn't know it, but the Seahawks are in contention too.

""And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you.

""Now you play a pretty good defense, boy, but give Pete Carroll his due:

""I bet a playoff berth against your worth, 'cos I think we're better than you.""


The Bear said: ""My name's Peanut and it might be a sin,

""But I'll take your bet, your gonna regret, 'cos I'm the best that's ever been.""

Peanut always tossin' blows and punch on that ball so hard,

'Cos hells broke loose in Chicago and Pete Carroll deals the cards.

And if you win you get this shiny trophy made of gold.

But if you lose, Pete Carroll gets your soul.


Pete Carroll opened up his book and he said: ""I'll start this show.""

And fire flew from his fingertips as he started talking low.

he started callin the signals in and it made an evil hiss.

Then a band of Corners joined in and it sounded something like this.

When Pete Carroll finished, Peanut said: ""Well you're pretty good ol' son.

""But sit down in that chair, right there, and let me show you how its done.""

Fire off the snap count, run boys, run.

Pete Carrolls in the house of the Soldier's son.

Pete Carroll bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.

He laid that golden trophy on the ground at Peanut's feet.

Peanut said: ""Carroll just come on back if you ever want to try again.

""cause I told you once, you son of a bitch, I'm the best there's ever 
been.""

And he played fire off the snap count, run boys, run.

1347385772.0	zpw4x	5 reasons we will beat the Packers at their home field this Thursday night	pygreg	112	9	62	"**1. The Packers are awful against the run.** We know this. Frank Gore destroyed them. Hell, we gashed them for 121 yards with Kahlil Bell (3rd string) and McCown (3rd string) last year. And we no longer have Martz, who refused to call run plays (seriously -- he called *7* in the first Packers game last year). We have arguably the best 1-2 punch of running backs in the league, a passing threat to open up even *more* running lanes, and a line above-average at run blocking (check the stats). Control the clock, keep Rodgers on the sideline, gash them on the ground, then hit their awful secondary with passes and play action.

**2. They won't be able to stop our passing game how they used to.** The Packers have stymied our offense in the last meetings. They done this by jamming our receivers at the line and by committing lots of defenders to the pass rush while leaving our awful receivers in single coverage. If they try that this week Brandon Marshall will burn them. They'll have to slow down their pass rush which will leave time for people to get open. And their pass defense is just awful, awful. And we finally have the weapons to take advantage.

**3. Short prep week.** This is true for both teams -- but they faced a much tougher, more physical opponent at home. Their best receiver might be out or much less effective due to injury. We have a new offensive philosophy (and Jay can audible!) with completely new talent and capabilities at both receiver positions that they don't have much time to scout or gameplan against. The teams are familiar with each other; but we're more familiar with them. Advantage: Bears.

**4. Our defense has historically slowed Rodgers down.** The Packers have an elite offense, but we know the past two years it's looked [slightly more average](http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/46046/on-the-green-bay-packers-drop-in-explosiveness) against us. We don't have the defensive talent or pass rush we did in 2010, but we don't need to shut them out. Just slow them down and let our offense put up points on their awful defense. And we can do that by taking away the deep throws and keeping them on the sidelines. And forcing turnovers of course.

**5. It's time.** We won the division in 2010 with an awful offense, and got disrespected and called lucky all year. We were 2 or 3 plays from going to the SB that year. We were on pace to easily make the playoffs in 2011 until Cutler went down and we got Hanie'd. We are the most complete team in the NFC North. We have the strongest defense. We have far and away the best special teams. We have the most well-rounded offense with a strong run game and passing attack. After Thursday we will know who the best team in the NFC North is (what *about* the Lions?). And I'm drinking the Kool-Aid, it's gonna be us. It's time to go back were we belong.

&gt;This is my favorite urban legend. American football fans will enjoy it particularly.

&gt;Friend is in a bar in Chicago during the off-season. He goes to the bathroom and sees Jay Cutler, hat on backwards, taking a piss at the urinal. So the guy starts going to the bathroom and says, âHey, Iâm a huge fan, also went to Vanderbiltâ¦ â Jay throws his head back, still pissing, eyes half-closed because heâs drunk, interrupts him with, âDOOOONNNNTTTTTT CAAAAAARRRREEEEEE.â

&gt;But all this talk of greatest this and best that leaves Tillman understandably uncomfortable.

&gt;âIâm just glad I have been on one team the last 10 years,â he said.

&gt;But what about the statistics and his rankings and place among all-time Bears?

&gt;âI am hungry,â Tillman said. âI am greedy. I am competitive. Stay hungry. Be competitive. It is tough but it is fun. Thatâs why we play this game. I am competitive and I think that is what brings out the best in everyone. I am always competing.

&gt;âI wish they wouldnât tell me stats and stuff like that. Tell me when Iâm old and the day I retire about all the stats I break. Itâs cool, itsâ an honor. The Bears go back 200 years, theyâre so old and all the great players whoâve come here and what theyâve done. To be that guy, yeah man, itâs an honor to represent this organization with that.â

I still remember that jump ball he took away from Randy Moss in 2003 and from that point on, I knew he was gonna be a player. I know people got on him for the '05 divisional playoff game when the coaches left him out on an island and Steve Smith ate him alive but he's otherwise been a very good and sometimes great player throughout his tenure, and yet he's still got that blue-collar, hard hat and lunch pail attitude."	t5_2s0u3	True

In 86, the Bucs had Steve Young.  He had a bad bad season.  In 87, Trestman's first year there, he had 3 QBs play for him, here are their relevant stats:


|Year|Name | Games started  | Completion Percentage | TDs|  INTs |
:---------|:--------------:|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:
|1987|Steve DeBerg | 8 |57.8|14|7|
|1987|Vinny Testaverde| 4|43|5|6|
|1987|Jim Zorn|1|55.6|0|2|

Not exactly world burners there.  Testaverde was a rookie that year, DeBerg was a 10 year vet, and that was Zorn's last year in the league.
____

From 88-89, he was the QB coach/OC for the Cleveland Browns.  In 1987, the year before he joined the team, the Browns were 10-5, finished first in the AFC Central and were 3rd in the league in scoring and allowed the second fewest points in the league.  In other words, a great offense and a great defense.  Their problem?  John Elway.  

Here's the stats: 


|Year|Name | Games started  | Completion Percentage | TDs|  INTs |
:---------|:--------------:|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:
|1988| Bernie Kosar|9|60.2|10|7|
|1988|Mike Pagel|4|53.0|3|4|
|1988|Don Strock|2|60.4|6|5|
|1988|Gary Danielson|1|59.6|0|1|
|1989|Bernie Kosar|16|59.1|18|14|

In 1988, the Browns went 10-6, were first again in the AFC Central.  They were 20th in offense, and 6th on defense.

In 1989, the Browns went 9-6-1, were first in the Central again, 14th ranked offense, 4th ranked defense. 

____
My initial reaction is, well, that the team's offense got *worse*, not better with Tressman coaching the QBs and acting as OC.

Continuing on.

_____

1990-1991, he was the QB coach in Minnesota.   Same deal, QB stats from both seasons below:

|Year|Name | Games started  | Completion Percentage | TDs|  INTs |
:---------|:--------------:|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:
|1990|Rich Gannon|12|52.1|16|16|
|1990|Wade Wilson| 4| 56.2|9|8|
|1991|Rich Gannon|11|59.6|12|6|
|1991|Wade Wilson|5|59.0|3|10|
_____
Some of you are probably too young to remember the early 90s Vikings.  They weren't very good.  Mediocre, but not good.  1990 was Gannon's 4th year in the league, but his first year starting.  The decline in his interceptions was nice to see though.  The 1990 Vikings finished 9th in scoring offense, which isn't bad.  You also need to remember that this was when the Vikings mortgaged their whole draft for Herschel Walker...the big dummies.  In 1991, they were 13th offensively.
____
After that, Trestman spent four years doing...I have no idea.  He came back into the league in 1995, and was the QB coach/OC for the 49ers for 2 years. In 1994, the 49ers won the SB, and went 13-3.  They were 1st in points scored and 6th in points allowed. Same deal, stats below, but this time I included Steve Young's stats from the 1994 season as well:

|Year|Name | Games started  | Completion Percentage | TDs| INTs |
:---------|:--------------:|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:
|1994| Steve Young|16|70.3|35|10|
|1995|Steve Young|11|66.9|20|11|
|1995|Elvis Grbac|5|69.4|8|5|
|1996|Steve Young|12|67.7|14|6|
|1996|Elvis Grbac|4|61.9|1|0|

_____
In 1995, the 49ers were once again ranked 1st in the league on offense (and 2nd in the league in D) but were knocked out in the Divisional round of the playoffs by the Packers.  In 1996, they were 3rd in scoring offense, and 4th in defense.  They once again lost in the divisional round to the Packers.
____
In 1997, he spent a year as the QB coach for the Detroit Lions.  They went 9-7 that year, were ranked 4th in the NFL in scoring.


|Year|Name | Games started  | Completion Percentage | TDs| INTs |
:---------|:--------------:|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:
|1997|Scott Mitchell|16|57.6|19|14|

____
That was the second best year of Scott Mitchell's career, and his 7th in the league.  The interesting stat to me is that in 1996, Detroit ranked 21st in offense, and the jump from 21st to 4th is impressive.
_____
1998 to 2000, Trestman went to Arizona where he was the QB coach and OC again.  Same deal, stats below:

|Year|Name | Games started  | Completion Percentage | TDs|  INTs |
:---------|:--------------:|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:
|1998|Jake Plummer|16|59.2|17|20|
|1999|Jake Plummer|11|52.8|9|24|
|1999|Dave Brown|5|49.7|2|6|
|2000|Jake Plummer|14|56.8|13|21|
|2000|Dave Brown|2|58.0|2|3|
____
In 1998, the Cardinals were ranked 15th in scoring offense.  In 99, they were ranked 30th.  Fuck.  In 2000, they were ranked 29th.  That's ""Bear-like"".
_____
In 2001 to 2003, he was the QB coach/OC for the Raiders. In 2001, he was the QB coach, 2002 to 2003, the OC.  Stats below:

|Year|Name | Games started  | Completion Percentage | TDs|  INTs |
:---------|:--------------:|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:
|2001|Rich Gannon|16|65.8|27|9|
|2002|Rich Gannon|16|67.6|26|10|
|2003|Rich Gannon|7|55.6|6|4|
|2003|Rick Mirer|8|52.5|3|5|
|2003|Marques Tuiasosopo|1|55.6|0|3|
_____
In 2001, the Raiders went 10-6, were 4th in the league in offense.  In 2002, when Trestman took over as the OC, they were ranked 2nd, offensively.  In 2003, his last year there, they were ranked 26th, offensively.  How much of that is due to Gruden leaving, and Gannon getting hurt, I have no idea.
_____
In 2004, Trestman became the Asst Head coach/QB coach for the Miami Dolphins.  This was his last stop in the NFL before going to college and then the CFL.  Stats below:

|Year|Name | Games started  | Completion Percentage | TDs|  INTs |
:---------|:--------------:|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:
|2004|AJ Feeley|8|53.7|11|15|
|2004|Jay Fiedler|7|53.2|7|8|
|2004|Sage Rosenroflcopter|1|41.0|1|3|

2004 was a very bad year for the Miami Dolphins.  They went 4-12 and their offense was ranked 28th overall.  That's bad.  2004 was AJ Feeley's first year with the team, and 3rd year in the league.  It was Jay Fiedler's 8th year in the league, and last with Miami (and last game in the league starting before his career ended)  Sage Rosenfels was in his 3rd year at the time, but frankly he has never been a starting caliber QB and probably never will.  Career backup.

Yes, I hate your team with the strength of a thousand suns, but after the Packers had to hear shit all week after the Niners game, about how this game was ""do or die"" for us, and that our season was already over, well, I don't envy the even longer week your guys will have to endure hearing about Cutler and the offense. It's not going to be fun. In the end, I have a healthy respect for my fellow midwesterners and love the rivalry that has been built. 


Also, next time, I really think we should plan ahead and get the [charity bets thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/zsgkm/rchibears_charity_bets_vs_rgreenbaypackers/) more attention. It's a great idea. I saw it too late for this game but I'm in for $50 next game.

I know tomorrow will be an amazing, hard-fought, old-school, ground and pound game and I am so excited to watch our teams battle it out. I'm sorry to here Cutler is out and I feel that the 49ers should not be taking any chances with Alex Smith and should bench him, but that's not going to happen. As of now, the spread on this game is SF by 7, but that is *way* too big. Best of luck tomorrow and may the best team win!

TL;DR: The Bears are one of the classiest and most respectable teams in the NFL and I know tomorrow will be a good game!

**EDIT:**
Just a followup.... I noticed Trestman is not directly selling anymore (not sure if this will change or not) DO NOT buy from any of those guys charging $50+  That is not him. 

I bought mine directly from him for less than $20. And I think part of the proceeds go to charity.

I've been trying to explain to these people that the only way to win in this league is to pass every down. And pass DEEEEEEP! And you need 7 step drops, and 5 WR's on every play! But did they listen??? NO! 

So I'll take my talents elsewhere. My only regret is that these people could not understand just how smart I am... I'm a freaking genius, and I've created the most brilliant offense that the world has ever seen. And these ""Coaches"" and ""Bosses"" just can't comprehend that.

A few friends and I drove to Chicago yesterday from Iowa to go to it. 

[Here I am ready to party.](http://i.imgur.com/kHtB5Ll.jpg)

[Here is my buddy who dressed up as Ditka.](http://i.imgur.com/sT3busV.jpg?1)

[Here we are together at Joe's.](http://i.imgur.com/IeIsirM.jpg)

We had a GREAT time but unfortunately none of us got to see Cutler or Kristin. We didn't have VIP tickets and spent most of our time on the dance floor. I *knew* he was there because I saw photos on Twitter but we had gotten there fairly early to eat so I think we were already inside by the time they arrived. They also left fairly early and the reason I know that is because a guy I had been talking to at the bar came over to me and said ""You *JUST* missed Jay!"" They walked right by where I had been standing for about 20 minutes but then apparently chose the wrong time to go to the bathroom. I assume the look on my face resembled that of a 4 year old who just had their ice cream taken and then eaten in front of them. I was pretty bummed.

However, despite not getting the opportunity to see him in the flesh, we still had a BLAST. [Billy Ocean is the fucking man!] (http://i.imgur.com/cOVitRO.jpg) The event seemed to go over pretty well and they had some AMAZING silent auction items. I *wish* I had the money to bid on a football signed by Uncle B or Cutty's signed cleats or a signed Ditka jersey or on any of the other items they had (except for what appeared to be a napkin signed by the Kardashian sisters), but I don't. I did laugh seeing George McCaskey's name on the bid sheets knowing full well I doubt he really needs to bid on those kinds of things... but, charity.

I'm sorry I don't have a sweet story about how I got to ""accidentally"" touch Jay Cutler's butt. Maybe next year."	t5_2s0u3	True

*First, we learned that our offense does indeed have some great potential.  To me that was our best game offensively all year. We moved the ball against a great defense all day and should have came out with closer to 30 points today.  I know we did not execute on the 4th and 1 and Earl's drop but if we get either one of those i believe we win soundly.

*Two, I see a lot of negativity towards our defense.  Yes they played pretty bad at the end of the game but I cant put the blame solely on them.  Once we took the lead we started calling the game like we were up by 2 TDs on offense.  We put the game in the defenses hands for the whole 4th quarter and they finally wore out.  Pass the god damn ball with on 3rd and long when Jay is playing as well as he is.

*Three, this Cutler to Marshall combo is awesome to watch and they are getting better each week.  Its a pleasure to watch and imagine if we can get Alshon back healthy. The potential there with the way our o-line played today is endless.  

*Four, our run game wasnt great but i think as the make shift line starts to gel that the Bush-Forte combo can be pretty good as well.  

*Five, everyone has bad stretches in a season and in the long run i think it can help us.  This is waking us up, pointing out our problems that we have 4 more weeks to improve upon before the playoffs (granted we make it).

*Six, I believe we will still make the playoffs as we have a two game advantage over the 7th place team in the NFC.  Lions and Cardinals are fading away so if we can win those two which we should and one of the next two we will be fine.

*Seven, maybe im crazy but i think we can still make a huge run in the playoffs.  We have a veteran team thats been there before.  Although we had problems i believe they are fixable and we can definitely turn it on for one last run

Sorry i had to vent

[MY Response in the form of Satire](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1h28x3/larry_fitzgerald_in_arizona_vslance_moore_in_new/)


**Edit:  (I have a hunch a packer fan Mod Took it down from the ranks. I have included  the original post below)** 

**Larry Fitzgerald in Arizona vs.Lance Moore in New Orleans -- an in-depth comparison *SATIRE***

I was reading an article about Lance Moore when it mentioned that he played with Deuce McAllister  while he was with the Saints back in 2006. After immediately thinking , Moore is surprisingly old! I went to look up his stats to see where he'd bounced around before catching on with the Saints. His numbers were a little better than I thought they would be, and upon further investigation I discovered that his Receiving stats over the past year in New Orleans are surprisingly superior to another prominent WR's stats during that same period:

Lance Moore 65 Rec , 1,041 rec yards, 6 TD, 16.0 ypr

Larry Fitzgerald 71 rec, 798 rec yards , 4 TD , 11.2 ypr

That's a damn better performance (and note that both WRs have been with the same team for all 16 games last year), save for Fitz's madden rating almost 20 points higher. This got me thinking -- Why do we think of Moore as a role player (or never-was) when we think of Fitzgerald as a talented WR in a bad offense?

Well, maybe it's because Fitzgerald has less Targets? Or does he?


**Player 	  2012	Targets**




Moore	    	 **105**

Fitzgerald      	**153**

From their identical receptions they appear to have similar catching ability, although Moore is able to maintain that level of efficiency far less targets. They also fumble at the same rate. **0**

**A few other notes:
**

**1.**  Strength of schedule: I don't know of anywhere to find the record of each team's opponents, but I'm assuming over one season they'll end up about the same.

    
**2.** Injuries: Injuries to one's teammates can harm a WR's performance, but because injuries are mostly random from year-to-year I'm assuming the injury rate of each team will be about the same season.

    
**3.** Why just the last year? Both WRs started roughly the same number of games on the same team over the last year, and the most recent season is probably more relevant to how a WR will perform in the future.

**TL:DR:** So what does it all mean, Basil? In short, Moore and Fitzgerald aren't that different. Fitzgerald gets far more targets, but Moore is a more efficient catcher (and just as likely not to fumble). Moore plays with a better QB, but Fitzgerald plays with a better defense. Neither has had great mascots to cheer them on, and both have struggled with total receptions. All things considered, we give Fitzgerald too much credit and Moore too little.

I was [trying to think of what we can do](http://cbssports.com/images/blogs/urlacher-cutler-webb-300x325.jpg) for our [quarterback](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1476583/cutler-cat.jpeg) when y'all suggested that we donate to his charity, the [Jay Cutler Foundation](http://www.jaycutlersix.com/JCFoundation), which helps underpriviledged children and those suffering from diabetes. Articles about past contributions [here](http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/outside-game-jay-cutler-inspires-others-type-1-181957266--nfl.html) and [here](http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/1112784901/jay-cutler-foundation-donating-15000-to-sponsor-second-year-of/)

I set up a fundraiser site at crowdrise.com: http://www.crowdrise.com/JCFoundationByRedditCHIBears so all proceeds should go directly to the [Jay Cutler Foundation](http://www.jaycutlersix.com/JCFoundation) (No untrusted intermediary handling the money).

If we band together as /r/CHIBears and donate to his cause, I'm sure it'll be one of the best wedding gifts he'll get, after [this](http://ifelicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/kristin-cavallari.jpg) of course.

You can't keep firing OC's without giving them enough time (more than 1 season, for god sake) to gel.

Unless Ditka comes out of retirement, firing Lovie at the end of this season makes the same amount of sense as putting Urlacher on waivers. 

Devin Hester's return numbers are middle of the pack and do not ~~take into effect~~ account for the squibs and directional kicking teams are still doing to avoid him. 

You guys need to settle down. With little maneuvering in the off season our offense could become truly elite, and with little to no maneuvering our d line and secondary will remain elite.

1363189205.0	1a7x9s	For all the Bushrod skeptics out there	dmfaber1	66	10	40	"I am sure plenty of you are worried about all of the Saints fans and some experts saying that Bushrod is an average player at best and the Bears paid way too much. Don't worry, here is the rational the Bears actually got a good deal.

* Starting quality LT's don't hit FA. This year the only starting caliber LT to hit the market were Bushrod (Saints don't have cap space) and Long (Injury concerns and excessive salary demands). The rest get franchised or resigned. 

* Offensive linemen are at an all time high in demand. The freak athletes are becoming DE's, not LT's. The balance of power is arguably at an all time extreme favoring the defense.

* The pricetag for offensive linemen is growing accordingly. Gosder Cherilus got identical money to Bushrod, and he is an average RT with one good year! Loadhalt got 4 years $25 million. Volmer and Smith with end up getting bigger deals than Bushrod, and while better players, they play the easier RT position. Someone will break the bank for Jake Long, hoping for Joe Thomas production. Maybe they will get it, but irregardless these cases make Bushrod look like a very good value.

* The draft is not looking so good for OL at #20. Joekal, Fisher, Johnson, Warmack, and Cooper are all looking to be gone. No other OL in the draft can be counted on for immediate impact. This added pressure to address OL in FA.

* Bushrod was the best way to add talent to the Bears offensive line. Loadhalt, Albert, Clady and Beatty didn't hit the market. Long, Levitre, Volmer, Smith and Vasquez were out of the Bears price range. De La Puente and Velasco were RFA's. That basically leaves Bushrod, Cherilus, or a couple aging interior linemen like Booth, Moore, or Koppen. Bushrod is by far the best out of this group. Plus he fits pefectly with Kromer's system.

* By not pursuing an $8-10 mil a year RT like Volmer or Smith, or a $10-$12 mil a year LT like Long, or a $6-$8 mil a year G like Levitre and Vasquez, the Bears were able to sign a potential pro-bowl caliber TE. The fact that Bears were even able to sign a tacle after getting a guy like Bennett is a major coup for Emery.

* Yes Bushrod probably isn't a legit pro-bowl LT, he will have his share of mistakes and is not a guy who will lock down the left side of the line. But he is a quality starter that fits our scheme and will significantly improve the OL. $7 mil a year is a very reasonable price for what we got."	t5_2s0u3	True

1355157594.0	14lz3u	How Emery can fix the Bears	dmfaber1	69	11	183	"The Bears don't need a teardown and a major rebuilding period, but they will in a couple years if they don't make some big changes in the off season.

* Fire Lovie Smith. It needs to be done. Lovie has had a good run here, but it is time for a change. Because of the talent on the team now, and the dynamics of the league, the path to the Super Bowl needs to be driven by the offense. Lovie is a good coach, but he has proved incappable of hiring an offensive coordinator. To stick with Lovie is to stick with Tice. Even if we have an improved oline next year, I feel like Tice isn't capable of taking the training wheels off this offense. He just doesn't have the x's and o's knowelege. The Bears need a head coach that has experience with a high power offense. I think Sean Payton would be ideal. Maybe that is a pipe dream. Even a defensive minded coach like Cowher would work, as long as he can get a good OC to come with him. The point is the Bears need some good offensive coaches for a change.

* Fix the Peppers situation. Peppers has been incredible for the Bears since he got here. But he is making too much money over the next couple years. Re-negotiate his deal. His cap hit can't be 15-20 mil over the next few years for the performance he will give us. The other option is to trade him. Like when Belicek traded Seymour a couple years ago, if we can get a good draft pick and unload his contract, it might be smart to shop him. 

* Fix the offensive line. This goes without saying, but they need a lot of help. Even if we were to unload Peppers, it is unlikely we could sign a guy like Clady. Teams just don't let elite olinemen go. Jake Long might be the exception because of his injury history, but that would be a risk. I think the smartest move is to hit it heavy in the draft. It is supposed to be a good draft for olinemen, and that needs to be taken advantage of. Probably to the tune of 2 in the first 3 rounds, depending on value where you are picking.

* Finally replace Olsen. Time to get with the times, elite offenses have elite TEs. Try to draft Eifert or sign someone like Cook. It's ok if you don't hit a home run and get someone on caliber with Gronk, but you have to get someone who can create mismatches and be a reliable reciver.

* Replace Hester. He isn't an elite kick returner and not making a huge impact in the passing game. He isn't terrible, but at this point, not worth the money. Draft Johnny Knox 2.0. Look for someone who can run  4.3 in the middle rounds. Doesn't matter if they are pretty raw otherwise. Ideally experience as a KR as well. Then just put him on the field as a #3 or #4 reciever and have him do nothing but go deep."	t5_2s0u3	True

- We don't know that anyone wanted to trade with us, so we can't fail the Bears for this

- There are two types of reaches. Taking a positional player over the ""best player available,"" and headscratchers. Everyone's treating Long like he's a headscratcher, but these are the same people that bitch and complain every year that we need to fix the O-line.

My answers:
I'm originally from the Chicago area, but I live in Philly now. I grew up a Bears fan and I will ALWAYS be a Bears fan. When my wife and I first discussed moving to Philly, I told her IF we moved that we had to have DirecTV and the Sunday Ticket will ALWAYS be in the budget (and it was even when I was unemployed for two years).

1359242893.0	17c92v	A play-by-play breakdown and accompnaying statistical analysis showing why J'Marcus Webb is a good football player.	Humpty-Dumpty	68	18	45	"Anyone whoâs been on these boards over the last year is probably aware that I am JâMarcus Webbâs number one fan. I liked what I saw out of a few games from him last year, when he absolutely destroyed guys like Trent Cole and Jason Pierre-Paul, but also admitted that his game was thoroughly inconsistent, as shown by his terrible performance against Jared Allen in the last game of last season. Over the off-season, however, I was convinced that Webb would improve in what would be his first off-season at the position (as the lockout made it difficult for him, a sophomore 7th-round pick, to pick up a position he had never played at the pro level). Though he had some shaky performances (most notably the San Francisco game, which I believe was more of a result of very bad protection adjustments at the line of scrimmage on the part of Garza and Campbell rather than by bad physical line play by Webb), by the end of the season I was convinced that my faith had been justified. I did, however, feel the need to provide evidence to show it. This is that evidence.

I decided to go through a game on a snap-by-snap basis in order to analyze Webbâs contribution to each individual play. I ran with the second Vikings game because, well, that was the game that killed our season. Webb also has historically posted some pretty bad numbers against Jared Allen in the past, to the tune of allowing like 4 sacks in their last meeting of the 2011 campaign. I wanted to choose a game where people couldnât say I was cherry-picking a good Webb game, but I also wanted it to come in the second half of the season, when Webb really turned it on. Also, I wanted a game where we played from behind a lot, to better demonstrate both Ticeâs and Webbâs behavior when needing to throw a lot of passes. Minnesota 2 seemed like the best candidate.

I went through the game snap-by-snap, noting what snap it was, how many defenders there were, what the result of the play was, and what Webb did during that snap. I probably watched each snap at least three times to make sure my data was accurate. After describing Webbâs contribution to the play, I assigned him a grade so that I could have a statistical sampling of the game. I realize that this is only for one game, and that itâs a small sample size, but the results match up fairly well with what I observed towards the latter half of the season. Also, if you want to complain about small sample sizes, then you do the work and go analyze the Seahawks game, you jackass.

Iâll take a quick moment to explain my rating system, which is very elementary, as Iâm no scout but simply an amateur watching film. Really bad and bad should be self-explanatory; Webb either gave up quick pressure, got called for a hold, or otherwise really botched his assignment on the play. No impact should also be self-explanatory. Okay was generally reserved for times when Webb did his job but got help. I assigned a good grade for when Webb singlehandedly held off pressure for enough time for Cutler to make a play, or for when he made a standard block that affected the running play in a positive fashion. Excellent grades were reserved for when Webb took out two defenders in pass protection or made a particularly athletic play in the running game, where the play wouldnât have happened without a particularly good showing from Webb. Also, there were some plays where there was such a clusterfuck on the line that I wasnât able to tell what was going on, and for those I assigned an unsure grade. The ratings are approximate, and sometimes I assigned a good grade for what someone else may have called okay, or vice versa. I wasn't going for 100% accuracy, but rather a general picture.

I want to point out that I watched this film in a free hour that I had, and that, as such, there might be discrepancies. Iâm not 100% certain that there were only 75 Bears offensive snaps, and I may have missed one or two in my fast-forwarding. Still, I think that this paints a pretty solid picture.

Anyways, hereâs the [link]( https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7Gt4sJPC4X4SE1BV29aM1lLVzQ/edit) to the dataset. I decided to host it on Google Docs instead of posting it here because Iâm a lazy asshole that just put about five hours into this project and I didnât feel like formatting the document for reddit tables. Sue me.

Letâs dive in. First off, just looking at the bad and really bad, Webb only had 4 bad plays the entire game. Given that there were about 75 offensive snaps, that means that Webb had a bad play on 5.33% of his snaps, which is really not bad. Most of those bad plays came in the running game and resulted in stuffs at the line of scrimmage, though he had one snap that was an absolute drive-killer with his hold. In his defense, he was anticipating a chip from Weems that didnât come, and Allen may have gotten some movement in prior to the snap, but he really shouldâve been able to pick that up better than he did. Still, 5.33% is a pretty solid number.

Far more interesting, however, is that Webb had over double the plays that I rated excellent as opposed to bad or really bad. Webb had 10 plays (13%) that graded out as excellent, including multiple occasions where he pancaked his man, took out two defenders, or accurately read and picked up the blitz. On one particular play that is highlighted in my mind, Webb got his hands on Allenâs shoulders, shoved him into the LG, then squared off against the stunting DT and pushed him past the pile. Really nice work there.

Webb had 26 plays (34.7%) that I rated as good, which were generally when he was left alone or singlehandedly took out one defender. Given that that defender was often Kevin Williams or Jared Allen, âgoodâ might be an understatement, but there you have it. He additionally had another 21 plays (28%) that I rated okay, where he did his job but received help. All over plays were either no impact plays where the play went the other way, or plays where I was unsure what exactly happened in the mess they call the trenches.

Overall, Webb positively contributed to the play on 75.7% of his plays, had no impact on 17.3% of his plays, and negatively contributed on 5.3% of his plays, combine this with statistics available behind Pro Football Focusâs paywall, which show that Webb gave up 0 sacks and 8 combined pressures in his final 6 games, as well as that Bearsâ RBs averaged 4.2 YPC total but 4.85 YPC through Webbâs gaps, and I think we can safely paint the picture that Webb was a decent LT at worst last year. All of that for 490k against the cap.

Beyond that, thereâs some other interesting information contained in the dataset that can help us rule out some pretty common misconceptions. First, Webb didnât get help on every single play, and the Bears didnât run max protect on every single play. In fact, the Bears ran out of 5- or 6-man protection schemes on 49 of their passing plays, and employed 7- or 8-man protection schemes on 21 of their passing plays. Further, though I donât have numbers on it, a lot of those 7- or 8- man protection schemes involved a TE or WR chipping and releasing, which is an extremely common thing to do in the NFL. Even accounting for that, 21 7- or 8-man protection schemes is a lot, but itâs not nearly as bad as a lot of people think.

Whatâs more interesting, though, is that when you look at when the Bears had the most success, it was in their 5- and 6-man protection schemes. We converted a lot of first downs when the Bears didnât clog the pocket, but rather had receivers running routes and confusing the secondary. As it turns out, our O-Line is actually good enough to block for a 3- or 5-step drop most of the time, and even if it isnât, Cutler has gotten good at evading pressure (especially when itâs coming from his right side, which it was for most of the game). This was especially evident in our first scoring drive.

As another observation, I want to say that Ticeâs protection schemes and running plays really, really blew goats in this game. I canât count the number of times where I saw one or two guys doing absolutely nothing during a play in which Tice had 7- or 8 guys defending against a 4-man pass rush. If the RB doesnât have anything to do, he should be running a damn route, not sitting in the back and waiting for pressure that isnât going to come. Christ, Tice, let Forte read and react. Thatâs what heâs good at.

Going back to Webb. Webb probably got help on about 40%-50% of his pass protection snaps. The level of help varied, as sometimes heâd get a chip and others an out-and-out double team from the LG or RB. As plays were often designed so that Webb would guide his assignment into the double, itâs impossible to tell whether or not he would have needed the double on those plays. However, when he was left alone on an island, he did relatively well, with really only one blown play.

The two positions that really needed help were LG and RT. I didnât look at the right side of the line all that often as I was concentrating on Webbâs performance, but the RT gave up a ton of pressure on a consistent basis. Scott made some good plays, but more often than not was the reason that Cutler had to force a throw. Additionally, Edwin Williams really had a bad game. On one particular play, Webb blocked Allen into Williams and then released to pick up a stunting DT. Williams failed to get his hands on Allen, who sprinted up the hole that the DT had created by forcing Webb to the outside and sacked Cutler for a drive-killing loss. Really great play by Webb that was destroyed by the lack of competence at the LG position. We really need better interior play from there.

Overall, however, I see a lot that I like in this line. Even in this game, the pass protection was much improved from last year, and Webb played like a man on fire for all but a handful of plays. If this game is evidence of consistent behavior on his part, I think the Bears have found their LT of the future. It just took him a really long time to get there.

THESE PLAYERS ARE 8-6 AFTER BEING 7-1 AND THEIR BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS ABOUT THE FANS.

If you ask me, the booing isn't only because of the losing at home alone (though doesn't that deserve booing? Which honest player wouldn't say that?). It's about the lack of resilience of the team - the way they *look* when they lose.

As a Packers fan told me about the last game, it looks like the ""wind"" comes out of their ""sails.""

That's what we're booing. I'll boo that any day. I'll boo Bears ""greats"" like Briggs and Urlacher any day if that's what they put on the field.

If more Bears looked like they cared about winning (like Brandon Marshall), then I wouldn't be about booing. Rather than pointing a finger at the *fans* (the **FANS**), Marshall is complaining about results. Complaining about ""long faces"" on the sidelines (as you can see in a recent ""Wired"" clip. Did you see that? It was like he was talking to zombies.)

He's not butt hurt about the fans. He's worried about the offense. About accountability.

Not surprisingly, he's the best player on the team.

Go figure that a team that's 8-6 after going 7-1 has nothing better to talk about than the fans. Maybe they should worry about losing just about every game the last two months. But no - their egos, and therefore themselves, are more important than the Bears team.

That's what I boo.

Urlacher and Briggs are among my favorite players, but they're both wrong. No one out there is booing Brandon Marshall. We're booing the lack of resilience. The wind coming out of their sails every home game. The 2012 season collapse that's entirely on their heads.

The fact that Urlacher and Briggs are more concerned about their precious feelings and who's team boos more than who is a sad summation of the Lovie Smith Era.

It is, after all, Lovie Smith who is ultimately responsible for the attitude of the team.

What's their attitude? To look defeated and zombie-like when playing *at home* against a hated rival ... well before the game is over. I don't care how committed Lovie Smith is to keeping his cool - that's not all right.

Their attitude is to complain that they got booed for that. To blame *the fans* for booing that.

It's like blaming the refs for calling a hold when there's obvious holding.

Attitude reflects leadership. Lovie Smith, your Waterloo has come.

**EDIT:** Oh, and Chris Conte, if we're talking about what's ""real,"" then *real* players don't complain about fans.

Since it's the offseason and we're all watching a lot of highlight reels for various prospects, I thought it'd be productive to get a discussion going as to what we should be looking for in these videos. I'll get us started with some stuff I've picked up while studying this, but I encourage (nay, I demand!) the more knowledgeable guys to step in and supplement/correct what I've laid out here. 

Disclaimer: I'm erring on the side of including ""too much"" info - let me know if it seems overwhelming and I'll tone it down for future posts (or let me know if you like the detail). The goal here isn't to turn us all into scouts overnight; it's simply a way to elevate the discussion from ""this guy looks good"" to ""this guy looks good *because*..."".

I figure I'll start out with some positions of need for the Bears, and if there's interest, I'll keep going to other positions. **Please give me your feedback** - if there's something I can be doing better with these posts, tell me!

Okay, without further ado...

**OFFENSIVE LINE**

**Offensive Tackle**

Quick note - there are some pretty big differences between what an OT does on a run play versus a pass play. I'll try to distinguish where appropriate. Also, a ton of what I'm putting under OT can and does apply to OG and C, so those sections will be noticeably shorter.

1. Balance - does the prospect maintain his balance from the snap through the end of the play? In the run game you want a guy who maintains his balance as he shoves through his defender (so as not to get easily deflected). In pass protection you want a guy who can set a solid base and maintain it through contact so he doesn't get pushed over, knocked to the side, etc. A lot of this is impacted by...

2. Footwork - does he do a good job mirroring the defender (pass pro)? By this I mean he should be quickly/accurately shuffling his feet to mirror the defender to prevent the defender from getting past him. He has to quickly match the defender's footwork but he has to be quick to change directions if the defender does, or he'll go right around him. In the run game he needs to be able to trap/pull and get to the second level (i.e. block through the initial defender and get to the LB, and then get a block there).

3. Speed - on a run play, how quickly can he get to the second level after breaking through? How fast can he set the edge? On a pass play, how fast can he shuffle his feet to stop an NFL edge rusher (who are fucking *fast*)?

4. Leverage - can he naturally bend his knees, keep his back straight and use quick hands to get leverage? The battle for leverage is, imo, the single most important battle that no one ever notices (and yet happens on every single play).

5. Hands - In pass pro, does he get an explosive punch off the snap? How quickly, and how accurately, is he getting his hands inside the chest plate of the defender? This is a big part of where leverage comes from - good hand placement. After the initial punch, how quickly does he get his hands back in position? In the run game, can he get his hands in place *and maintain the block*? When watching a run play, first watch to see if he makes a good block, and then see if he can maintain it. A good block is helpful; a good block that is maintained is the difference between a 6 yard gain and a 60 yard TD.

6. Strength - Can he absorb a bull rush (balance and setting a low base are key here)? Does he get a good, hard initial punch off the snap? Does he stick to his blocks or does he get disengaged with ease? Does he win the leverage battle more often than not?

What won't necessarily show up on highlight reels: 

1. Size. Okay, you can kind of see this, but OTs are generally in the 6'5"" range and ~310lbs. Taller guys may have problems with leverage, shorter guys may have issues getting run over (or have short arms). You need a big frame to take on arguably the fiercest guys on defense - the big guys who want nothing more than to *fuck your QB up*.

2.  Arm length. 33-34"" is about what you're looking for, but as a general rule, the longer the arms, the better. Longer arms = leverage advantage and the ability to impact the defender before they're all up in your grill.

3. Intelligence - an OT has to (obviously) understand the offense's protection schemes and his assignments. He has to be able to be able to identify a blitz and instinctively know what to do in those situations. He has to ""keep his head on a swivel"" and always be taking in more than just what the guy in front of him is doing.

4. Effort - You want a guy who's giving 100% on every snap, who's competitive almost to a fault, who will work his ass off both on Sundays and, more importantly, the other 6 days of the week. Film study, weight lighting, drills - these are insanely important tasks and you want a guy who thrives on this stuff. You want a guy who can take coaching well (every college player requires coaching) and loves the game.

**Offensive tackle TL;DR**: in pass pro he's got to be able to absorb a bull rush and move his feet quickly while doing a good job getting his hands inside the other guy's chestplate, and in the run game he needs to be able to explosively beat his first guy so he can get to the linebackers and block one of them. In both cases he has to maintain his balance and not overextend, or he'll get beat every time.

**Offensive Guard**

This section will be much shorter, as a lot of the OT stuff applies here. I'll just focus on where OG differs from OT.

1. Guards still need to be able to handle pass pro, obviously, but guards need to be able to dominate bitches off the line of scrimmage in the run game. They're going against nose tackles (who are like 350 pounds) so they need to be able to get initial explosiveness, win the leverage battle, and have the strength to not only hold off the NT, but get their body in a position where they can turn the defender and open up a hole for the RB.

2. In pass pro, there's less importance on footwork and more importance on anchoring ability. Think of it like this - an OT is on the edge, so while he has help on the inside, he's got to handle the edge rusher (usually) by himself. He's got to have the speed and footwork to keep up with that defender 1-on-1. A guard, meanwhile, has more support around him, so in pass pro it's more important that he can anchor himself and absorb that enormous body coming at him for the 4-6 seconds until the QB can get the ball out. When watching film of a guard on a pass play, watch to see if they're a) making the initial block without getting run over/around, and b) maintaining the block long enough for the QB to make a play.

**Offensive Guard TL:DR**: just read it, it's two god damn paragraphs

**Center**

Centers are usually smaller than the other guys on the line, not because they need to be, but because their size isn't as important as their **intelligence**. Think of the Center as a second leader on the offense. They're calling out assignments, identifying blitzes, and need to be ultra-aware of where the pressure is coming from and where they need to help out. Their physical abilities are similar to a guard's - they need to be good with leverage, need to get a good initial punch, and need to always be watching what's going on around them. Pass pro is still important, of course, but they're a big part of the run game and so they need to be able to create a hole when the situation calls for one.

**Conclusion/summary**: Everyone on the line needs to be able to win the leverage battle and everyone needs to be able to handle both run protection and pass protection. Tackles are usually bigger and need more athleticism/quicker feet, while Guards and Centers need to be better maulers and don't necessarily need the quick feet that Tackles need. Centers are usually the guys with the most football smarts on the line (and are often Guards who show exceptional awareness/intelligence). 

When watching film, I encourage you to watch it twice - once just to watch and see how often the prospect gets beat, whether he appears to be a dominant force, etc. You can usually tell a lot by just watching a play unfold and seeing whether they do a ""good job"" or a ""bad job"". Then, watch it a second time and pay attention to some of the things outlined here. If they got beat, why did they get beat? If the QB had 8+ seconds to hurl a deep ball, what did the prospect do well? 

As I mentioned, feedback is absolutely welcome. If you have something to add, a question you want to ask, or a correction you want to make, **please please please** do it - I want this to be a discussion. We have a great community here with a lot of good football minds, and I hope people will contribute to this.

I'm happy to tweak things with any suggestions. I feel like it is at some points way too detailed, and at others woefully inadequate. I know there are pieces I've left out. It's hard trying to find that balance between readability for someone not as invested in the Bears, vs. fully fleshing out the issues. 

Anyway, hope you all enjoy it. I'm supposed to post sometime tomorrow afternoon-ish, so I have time to make changes as the community gives feedback.

**Preface** 

* A quick highlight and shout-out to a class organization for their treatment of [Johnny Knox](http://i.usatoday.net/sports/gallery/2009/NFL/weeklygallery/week2/s090920_bearsknoxpg-vertical.jpg). Even though it was pretty clear after his [injury](https://1-media-cdn.foolz.us/ffuuka/board/sp/image/1339/86/1339866294858.gif) (*warning, man nearly getting broken in half*) and subsequent spinal fusion that he wouldn't be playing football again, they kept him on the roster to get full access to rehab equipment and to clear the five-year barrier for full NFL retirement benefits. The Bears are a family-run organization and, in an often cold and business-focused world, went out of their way to take care of one of their own. 

**Analysis:**

* The 2012 Chicago Bears season really was a perfect microcosm of the Lovie Smith era. There were more highs than lows. The defense played [turnover-driven](http://cdn3.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1223557/briggs.gif), disciplined ball, consistently coming up with big plays and representing well at the Pro Bowl (both starting CBs in the NFC, [Tillman](http://cdn3.sbnation.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/1844949/154585788.0_standard_730.0.jpg) and Jennings, plus [Peppers](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_maw4ah14RL1r71ykqo1_500.gif) and Melton. Briggs turned down a chance to play) and leading the team to a 10-6 season. There were certainly [moments](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1261671/staffordgrassed_medium.gif) of pure defensive [joy](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/4465615/155469413.0_standard_352.0.jpg). 

* On the other side of the ball, though, performance was as erratic and stilted as it has ever been under Lovie. [Cutler](http://cdn3.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1261659/bearbros.gif) still has all of the [tools](http://cdn3.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1223611/cutlerbomb.gif) and [Marshall](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1883249/marshallstiff.gif) is beastly, but the praise ends there. But the third in a string of bad coordinators ([Tice](http://www.jonathanhoodshow.com/wp-content/uploads/Tice-the-OC.jpg), following Martz and Turner) led to uninspired play. 

* On the back of good defense and bad offense, the Bears slumped to a 3-5 finish to the season after starting 7-1, and missed out on the playoffs for the 5th time in 6 years. This is why Lovie had to go: he coaches teams that are perennially competitive, but never elite. True, the Bears are facing a talent gap that is the result of a decade of Jerry Angelo calling the personnel shots, but Lovie consistently hired friends (Former roommates Martz and Marinelli, brother-in-law Bob Babich, his son, former co-worker [Tice](http://cdn1.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1223359/cutlerjerk_medium.gif), etc) instead of the best for the job, which led to a lack of player development. Lovie was loyal to a fault, and that fault hit hardest on an offense that never had enough talent, and seemed to see players regress instead of progress. 

**Highs:**

*Offense:*

* While there was no stated âMarshall Metric,â it seems Tice didnât drop far from his Randy Ratio days. Marshall set a team record for receiving yards and was the first Bears receiver to cross 1000 yards since Marty Bookerâs first go-round with the team. 

* [Forte](http://cdn3.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1266099/bears20.gif) put in another 1000 yard season and Bush proved to be the answer for short-yardage plays. The offensive positive pretty much ends there.

*Defense:*

* #1 in [interceptions](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1476105/romopicksix.gif) and [INT TDs](http://cdn1.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1235725/gabby.gif), #2 in forced fumbles and fumble recoveries **([Tillman](http://throwtheflagblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Charles-Peanut-Tillman.gif) forced more [fumbles](http://i.minus.com/iOvZQ3WbvueuY.gif) than either the Packers or Colts totaled as a team, and [Jennings](http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2012/0920/nfl_g_jennings11_576.jpg) had more interceptions than the Eagles, Cowboys or Chiefs).** 

* For the first time in the (now ended) Lovie Smith era, the safety tandem seemed to stabilize, with Conte and Wright manning the middle. 

* [Melton](http://cdn3.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1223251/romosack3_medium.gif) continued to emerge as an elite DT, which is great during the year but trouble now that itâs contract time. Still, at 26 and at only his second year in the position, he put together a Pro Bowl season. There are some rumors the Bears are willing to let him test the FA market, but I donât see it. The aging defense has to keep its young stars in the fold. 

**Lows:**

* While [Marshall](http://cdn1.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1260879/bearstd.gif) set team records for receptions (118) and yards (1508), the passing game stops there. Second on the team in receptions was Forte (44) and the next receiver was Bennett (29, also second in yards at 375). 

* That discrepancy combined with nearly zero production from TEs in the passing game (Four TEs combined for a 33/318/3 line, and many drops) led to predictable play-calling and a technique regression from [Cutler](http://mikelikesthis.net/wp-content/gallery/gifs/0327534001357954466.gif). Itâs very clear he only trusts one option in the passing game right now, and heâs scared to throw it up to anyone else. Outside of Marshall and some of Forte, the offense [fell flat on its face](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/735194/MARION-BARBER-FLIP.gif). 

* Further, Forte, one of the best pass-catching RBs in all of football, was criminally underused in the passing game. Many of his 44 catches were desperation dump-offs, and his catch and yardage totals were his lowest since entering the league in 2008. In criticism of Forte, there were times when he appeared to play softâsomething you fear seeing after a young RB receives a big payday. Add Bennett and Hester to the âI got paidâ list of underachievers.

**Free agency/offseason concerns:**

* [OL](http://i.minus.com/inDuEHYqYZgOb.gif)
* [OL](http://i.cdn.turner.com/si/2010/writers/peter_king/09/23/weekend.pickoff.week.3/jay-cutler-tx1.jpg)
* [OL](http://cdn.ksk.uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cutler-sack8.jpg)
* [OL](http://media.philly.com/images/112810_Cutler-Sack_400.jpg)
* [OL](http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs3/1265008_o.gif)
* LB
* Overall talent/depth/youth

* This year we will learn a lot more about who GM Phil Emery is. His 2012 draft was done with Jerry Angeloâs scouts, system, and notes. He seems to have found some potential â [Alshon Jeffery](http://www.juanelway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Cutler-to-Jeffery-TD-GIF.gif) was leading rookie WRs in catches and yardage until he broke his hand, and [McClellin](http://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1264793/bears22_medium.gif) (DE) has shown flashes and a mean spin move. He brought in Marshall and [Bush](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1235773/bearhop.gif), and locked up Briggs and Forte. But he also failed to improve on a clearly inferior OL. Some would suggest that Tice and Lovie assured him that the current group of guys was the best group for the job. Some of it has to do with lingering injuries to 2011 1st rounder Carimi. And some of it, perhaps, was negligence. That is one area that [has to improve this year](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1295635/cutlerhit_medium.gif). Perhaps an elite free agent (Jake Long or Jermon Bushrod, although the cap space may not be there) or one of the many talents in available in this yearâs draft could shore up the line.

* The Bears have three LBs who started games for them in 2012 who will be free agents. [Urlacher](http://thebiglead.fantasysportsven.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/urlacher-int-11-4-12.gif) is an unrestricted free agent for the first time in his career, and while he has said heâs happy to take a team-friendly contact to return, the team has had many chances to say they want him back, and thus far have declined. Nagging injuries have slowed him down the past few years, and heâs looking at the wrong side of 35. His backup, Roach (and starting SAM backer) is also a free agent. Heâs not the most spectacular player, but heâs a solid starter and would get more credit on a team that didnât boast Urlacher and [Briggs](http://cdn1.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1235843/midwaymonster_medium.gif) as his complements. The Bears have talked to both [Urlacher](http://i.imgur.com/ntnSQ.gif) and Roachâs agents at the Combine, and seem to at least be interested in keeping them in the fold. 

* The Bears have suggested this week TE isnât a big position of need, but one has to wonder if this is smoke-and-mirrors. [Kellen Davis](http://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1189051/cutlertd.gif) occasionally flashes, but had a historically bad drop rate in 2013. HC Trestman has admitted heâs not sure how 2012 rookie TE/FB Rodriguez fits into his offense. Thereâs just no reliable receiving TE on the roster.

* And of course the OL. Many fans in r/CHIBears would actually prefer an OG to an OT, citing metrics that suggest [Webb](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1794603/bearshoe.gif) was actually the best lineman on the Bears last year. Many of his more egregious mistakes were actually breakdowns at LG that made him look bad, because the Spencer/[Rachal](http://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1261641/cutlerapproves_medium.gif) combo was taking on the wrong man. Garza is also a below-average C. Lovie seemed to valued leadership and knowledge more than athletic performance at C; we will see where Emery/Trestman move with that position. RG Lance Louis played well in 2012 but is a FA and is rehabbing an [ACL](http://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1322477/allendestroy.gif) In a draft loaded with OL talent, I would expect the Bears to try to build that way. Frankly they could spend all 5 picks on OL, and while thatâs not a sexy draft, I would be more than satisfied. *That may or may not (okay, it is) be reactionary meatball fandom speaking rather than actual football acumen.*

**Summary:**

Great defense. Bad offense. This is the recent story of the Bears franchise. But Marc Trestman inherits a 10-6 team, and he hired a Cover-2 DC who can keep the defensive schemes intact. With some [creativity on offense](http://i.imgur.com/5g19s.gif) and some more [talent on offense](http://www.niutke.com/cutler.gif), there is no reason to think the Bears canât be a playoff team in 2013.
