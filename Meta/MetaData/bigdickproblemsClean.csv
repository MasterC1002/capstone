Just a few of what I see here almost *every* day...

""What kind of condoms / where to buy large condoms?"" Check the sidebar.

""Do I fit in here?"" Yes. We don't have a size limit, or even a penis requirement.

""What underwear should I wear to hide bulge/play sports?"" Compression shorts.

""I don't like compression shorts."" Boxer briefs.

""Will my dick keep growing?"" If you're younger than 20 probably, but not by a lot.

""How do we have sex?"" Foreplay and lube. Then more lube.

""How do I measure my circumference?"" String or tailor's tape around thickest part.

""How do I measure my length?"" Along the top *not* the bottom, bonepress if you want.

------

I can't be the only one, can I? Can we just make an FAQ and then *any* topic that fits there will just be referred to the FAQ? I feel like this will open the forum to new discussions because people won't be so caught up answering the same questions dozens and dozens of times."	t5_2sqd6	True

This was awesome because I had just been dumped and I was suffering from a little post break-up depression. Then about 2 minutes later, almost in the same sentence, they tell me that they would like to have a threesome with each other. Now I'm psyched. 
Fast forward a week, and one of the girls comes over. Seducing her was probably the easiest thing I've ever done, but trying to actually stick it in was probably the hardest. This chick was beyond tight, and it probably didn't help that there was next to no foreplay. After about ten minutes of sex this girl looks like she's going to cry, so I stop and she heads home. 
Turns out she had to stop half way home to just cry because I hurt her. She told her friend this, her friend got scared, and no threesome for me.

The kicker? I'm only like 7x5.

TL;DR Literally fucked myself out of a threesome."	t5_2sqd6	True

1367336226.0	1dezaj	Spent last night in a hospital because I broke some girl's vagina	erotic_majesty	331	46	90	"A couple of weeks ago a met a girl through some friends. We hit it off, did the drunken makeout thing, and continued to stay in touch through text. She then invited me to her birthday party last weekend, which culminated in some drunken sex.

Now, I should point out that she's a very petite girl. Probably about 5'0"" and maybe 100 lbs, though I'm a bad judge of that kind of stuff. Main thing to remember is that she's short and thin.

The drunken sex is great, we wake up the next morning and hang out, and make plans to go on an actual date Monday night - I'll meet her at a restaurant near her house (where hopefully we will return for more sex).

Fast forward to Monday night and I'm in a cab trying to get to the restaurant, but traffic is awful and I'm running late. I text her to let her know, but she never responds, which I find odd at the time. Eventually I show up at the restaurant about 10 minutes late and see her walking toward me and she seems mad. She walks right up to me and says, ""I need to go to the hospital"" in a very calm voice. OK, now I don't know what the hell to think, but I just react, grab her hand and walk her to the street, grab a cab and tell him to take us to the closest hospital.

In the cab she tells me that she's bleeding profusely from her vagina, apologizes about 50 times and says how embarrassed she is. But, at that point I'm more concerned with making sure she's ok and don't really care about the embarrassing nature of things.

At the emergency room she's seen by a number of nurses and, because of the nature of where the problem is, they ask me to leave the room quite a few times. Eventually a doctor comes into the room, looks at me very sternly and asks me to leave the room. When I'm allowed back in the girl is laughing a little and tells me that there are multiple tears inside her vagina that were caused by our sexcapade two nights prior. The doctor told me to leave the room so he could ask her about what had happened to make sure she consented to the sex.

They stitched her up, released her and advised we use lube in the future.

So, overall, a fun first date.

**TL;DR:** My dick caused a girl to get stitches inside her vagina."	t5_2sqd6	True

She was a freak in bed and loved to be pounded by my member. she had one of the smallest vagina's i have ever fucked. It was tighter than a whale squeezing into a two piece. One night after some oral she decides to take it from the back doggy style. we usually never have sex doggy style because it hurts her, she was adamant about taking it from behind saying things like ""i want you to fuck me hard, i want that fat dick to pound me"" so i waddle on over to her from behind and insert my jackhammer. At first she is taking it like a champ, moaning and encouraging me to go harder better faster stronger. After i nut and after she has multiple convulsing orgasms we clean up and head over to her house. on the ride over she is complaining about her stomach hurting. it gets to the point where she is asking me to take her to the hospital, being the gentleman that i am i take her promptly to the emergency room. Turns out that i fucked her so hard that her cervix was pretty busted up, she had to stay the night while they gave her morphine to alleviate the pain. The relationship took a hit after that night, she was scared to have sex with me and ended breaking up with me this week. Guys if a girl is asking to be pounded make sure her vagina is big enough to take it.

1350257296.0	11hf8x	A timeline of how long it took to stretch her out - six months in total.	hungfun	227	50	42	"I find most of this subreddit pretty funny. The thing is, a big dick can actually be a serious problem. I didn't have sex until I was in my 20s, and it was with a woman who was briefly married beforehand, and had some (but not much) experience. In other words, she wasn't a virgin. We had sex very regularly. Here's the timeline:

* **Day 1**: (She hasn't had sex in a long time.) We have sex for the first time, using plenty of lube and foreplay. It hurts so much she's crying from the pain. After 10 minutes of going slow, I'm able to get about halfway in. She doesn't enjoy it - it hurts her far too much.

* **Day 3:** We've tried a few more times. I can't get more than 2/3 in. Any more, and she literally screams from the pain of me hitting the bottom. Yes, we've tried extensive foreplay, lube, and anything else to loosen her up more. It doesn't work. I'm slow and gentle, trust me.

* **Day 7:** We had quite a bit of sex in the first week. Initial penetration is still painful for her, no matter how slow I go, or how lubed I am. She's enjoying it after the first minute or so, when the pain mostly goes away. I can't go all the way in.

* **One month:** Significant foreplay and lube is still fully required for any sex. I still can't go in all the way without her crying out. However, I'm almost there.

* **Two months:** I can finally penetrate fully! It still hurts her at first. I basically need to stretch her out for a couple minutes, whereupon she's finally able to enjoy the rest. It's still slightly uncomfortable at full insertion, though.

* **Three months:** She doesn't *need* foreplay prior to initial insertion anymore. A little lube (natural or not), and she can take me without pain. I still need to take a few minutes of partial penetration before going in all the way.

* **Six months:** We've had sex about 200 times. I remember that it was (almost exactly) six months before I was able to go in all the way, on the initial insertion, without hurting her. Now, I like foreplay, don't get me wrong. But, finally, quickies are possible!

So, it took six months, or approximately 200 times, before I could go in all the way without hurting her.

That's why I think school sex ed, magazines, informational/educational websites, and parents should better teach young adults what to expect. If he's regular-sized, it will probably hurt. I might even hurt a lot. Also, you need a lot of lube (if she doesn't produce enough), lots of foreplay, and *please*, go slow at first! 

And if he's well endowed, and she's inexperienced, sex will probably be impossible. It might even take months before she can handle it. This might sound like a joke or a humblebrag, but seeing the woman you love crying and screaming from pain isn't actually all that funny."	t5_2sqd6	True

1369636009.0	1f4igj	Here's how to have sex with a big dick.	Malherron	207	42	35	"Hi guys. I'm going to skip a lot of the usual bullshit and go straight into a guide on how to have better sex if you have a big cock. I'm straight, so I'll be writing this as a guy would do to a girl (just out of habit), but you can probably transfer a lot of the things over to guy on guy, too, if that's how you swing. Excuse my bluntness, I usually don't realize it:

---

I once read about a 'golden sex rule', and I loved it, and it made my sex life awesome. Here it is:

**Sex shouldn't be goal-oriented.** Drop the notion that sex has to be about aiming towards an orgasm. *Don't aim for one.* Instead, it should be about exploring your partner's body, giving them intense pleasure, and having a lot of fun in the process.

Let her know before you start anything: ""I don't care about the orgasm. I just want to have an hour of pleasure. Both me and you. Let's really get into the feeling, instead of trying to make each other cum."" This takes a ton of the pressure off of both of you and lets you have a much better, more enjoyable time in bed. It lets both of you have a lot of fun. And, honestly, you'll probably both achieve an orgasm this way anyway. But don't aim for it.

---

**Will she be scared?**
Here's the situation: you have an *incredibly* massive dick. Your underwear can barely contain your bulge, and you're bigger than most of the guys in the porns you watch. You're the classic /r/BDP member. You're very proud of it, but you know your lady-friend might be *reluctant* to have sex with it. How do we get around this? *Well, if the girl hasn't seen your dick before, wait to show her until she's turned on as fuck.* I'm not talking five minutes – I'm talking about after she's soaking wet, shaking, and begging you for sex.

---

**Get mental.** As the ""Monstercock McPhee"" you are, you can't really try to have a quickie. *You've got to slow down.* This is where the majority of us mess up. You've got to start talking dirty, making out, kissing her neck. Explore her body with your fingers, trace her curves. Don't be rough – start arousing her with your voice, your breath, your fingertips. Ladies are very sensitive to the touch of your skin on her skin. Start having fun with the foreplay. (Spend twenty or thirty minutes of getting just her *mind* horny before you break into eating out or fingering. Tease her a lot. If your sex isn't goal-oriented, this exploration will be awesome and really fun. Trust me.)

---

**Give her the best.**
Receiving a present on Christmas is awesome! But seeing the smile on someone's face when they unwrap *your* present is even better. This is what it's like in bed: learn to want to *give* more than you receive. The sex will get even better for the two of you. Girls might tell their friends, too, which is a definite confidence booster. It's awesome to be known as the ""guy with the huge dick that's amazing at sex."" Yes, that can be you!

---

**You're big. Get condoms that fit. This is so important.**
The first couple times I had sex, I actually thought I was really small. I wore regular condoms. They always squeezed a red ring around my shaft, and the sex was terrible. Actually, it was so painful, I couldn't keep an erection with them. And because of that, I flat out couldn't have sex.

I switched to larger condoms on my fifth time 'attempting' sex. When I put it on, I was expecting pain, or at least some discomfort, like I had the last four times. But there *was* no pain. That day, my lady-friend and I broke her bed, and she marked it on her iPhone's calendar as ""Best Sex Ever Day"". Please do yourself a favor and buy condoms that fit. That'll help you get and stay hard, and it'll enhance the pleasure for both of you. Please. Please do this.

---

**Products were made for people like us.**
So your foreplay is amazing, and her mind is totally into it, and you've checked off everything all the way down the list. If a girl *still* doesn't have a lot of natural lubrication, use some good lube. I'd actually like to get some recommendations from our members: if you use lube, what kind does she prefer?

---

**She's not a shrimp. Don't skewer her.**
Be gentle. If your cock hits her cervix, adjust yourself and learn how far you can go in while it's still comfortable. I've always heard the ""in-and-out"" thrusting technique isn't really that pleasing for girls. Instead, slide your dick inside her and rock your bodies together. Your dick shouldn't be thrusting in and out of her – it should be staying inside the lips of her vagina. Your dick and the rocking motion fill her up and provide her with a lot of pleasure. When you do this, don't go too fast – go slow at first and respond to her motions from there. Keep the communication open. *Something really great that big dicks can do is provide her with this ""full"" feeling. Girls love it.*

---

**Positions are fun.**
Having a big dick allows you to do a lot of really cool positions. I won't go into them, because there are a lot, but my last partner's *personal* favorite was this:

Have the girl lay down on her stomach and to rise her butt *very* slightly into the air, just enough so you can get it in. Climb onto her back and insert yourself into her vagina. The angle at which you're penetrating her makes sure you're hitting the G-Spot with every motion you take. Your hands are free to hold down her arms and pull her hair, and the rest of your body can spoon with her, 'ride' her, or any other position you may like. The man dominates the woman in this position, controlling all of the motion, so communicate with her and see exactly what feels good to her.

---

I hope you can take something from this to help you during sex. Even if it's just one thing. To be honest, we all have awesome dicks, and we should know some tips on how to use them for better sex. Have a good night everyone. :)

As I said in the comments of that post, I promised to take her on an actual date once we could find the time. Well, that time was this past Friday night. We've stayed in touch, mostly through text, since the incident and she's had a pretty good sense of humor about the whole thing, which was a relief.

I met her at a restaurant, we had a good time and then she invited me back to her apartment, which is relatively close to where we were eating. When we walk in, her roommate of some of her friends were there, so we do the whole introduction thing. Finally one of the girls (it was a fairly even mixture of about 6 guys/girls) looks at my crotch and says ""so, this is the guy who sent you to the hospital?""

So, she had no qualms about telling everyone she knows about what happened, and I received quite a few nicknames that evening.

The doctor had advised her to avoid rigorous activities for a while, so I really didn't expect that we would enjoy any bedroom activities that night, and really didn't prepare in any way. But, she asked me if I wanted to stay over, and I figured we'd just do some making out, cuddling, etc. Well, she was fully prepared and as things heated up she reached over to her nightstand, pulled out some Astroglide and said she wanted to have sex again.

Long story short, we had sex a couple times that night and then again Saturday morning. Each time we used a condom, lube and had a lot of foreplay. I guess only time will tell if she has ""problems"" again, but I haven't gotten any texts or calls from the hospital yet.

TL:DR: Used lube and foreplay. No hospital visits, yet."	t5_2sqd6	True

""Suck it bitch."" After a good tootsie pop licking she mounted me. her immediate reaction was ""oh my god yes! Mmm, right there! Ohh oo ow OW oh shiiit oh god thundernuts I cant!"" she dismounted and started to cry. Me being the ever so thoughtful ladies man said ""what, thats it?""

She left me the next morning blue balled and frustrated. I cursed my member for being too big, then I realized how silly that was and beat it liked it owed me money.

I'm about 7 1/2 inches in length and around 6 1/2 for girth (a bit too large to fit in the cardboard roll of a toilet paper tube). When I'm completely soft however; I'm about half an inch for both. It almost completely disappears if it is cold enough. 

Also sometimes it seems to be thicker while being shorter, or longer and skinnier. It's like it changes shape depending on how turned on I am. Am I hallucinating? I will post pics/vids if there is enough interest.

There have been lots of men who have had ill-fitting condoms for years. There have been many stories about men who have had unprotected sex, been unable to maintain an erection and suffered from discomfort due to bad condom sizing. I had these problems for many years before I found this subreddit by accident and I learnt about mysize and theyfit. I know I shouldn't have had unprotected sex but in the heat of the moment and with a condom that doesn't fit it is easy to be stupid.

I was told condoms where one size fits all. That blogpost a few weeks ago where a sex educator wrote about how condoms are one size fits all shows that blatant lies that can cause pregnancy and AIDS are spread by schools and the medical community.

We should work to spread awareness about this problem and tell men that condoms are not one size fits all. Some men are long, some are short, some are thick and some are thin. Any ideas are welcome. "	t5_2sqd6	True

I usually use Trojan Magnum XL, but the nominal width of the Durex's are supposedly 3mm larger (54mm n/m for Magnum XL and 57mm n/m for Durex XXL) and I thought it would prevent the purple ring of death around my shaft. 

So I rip it out of the package last night, excited to possibly have something that fits properly, and was utterly disappointed just looking at it. The circumference was noticeably smaller than Magnum's, and my girl immediately said ""are you sure those are the right ones?"" I glanced back at the box again to make sure. ""Yup."" 

I placed it on my head and attempted to roll 'er down, but only got about two inches down the shaft before it stopped moving. I used some force to try and move it more, but wound up tearing the motherfucker right near the base ring. Son of a bitch. Tried another, ripped at the same damn spot. So I leaned over, ripped off a Magnum XL, and slid it down the shaft to start the sexy times. Although those are snug, at least they roll down completely without ripping.

I'm pretty disappointed to be honest. I thought the ""57mm nominal width"" would actually work out for me, but apparently not. I'm convinced that Trojan uses a better, more elastic latex, while Durex uses something cheaper that stretches less. For now, I'm sticking with my Magnums, but hopefully the FDA will reverse its ban on large condoms soon. This BDP sucks.

It all started in a strange land and a strange time. Ah yes, high school. I was getting sexual for the first time in my life, and it was awful. I could barely get the tip in without a cautionary hand on my chest and a protest in pain. I had stupidly not brought condoms I was nervous as hell throughout the encounter. The whole experience left me with the notion that I had hurt my partner and a mild anxiety attack. 

Despite the obvious pain, my partner had an outrageously strong sex drive and was eager to try again. Wising up, I bought some generic trojan condoms and was looking forward to the next opportunity. The next opportunity came. On goes the condom. Down goes the penis. It was crazy tight, that is how it should be right? Gotta keep them sperm cells on lock down. I tried my hardest to stay my hardest that time and many more. It was getting frustrating for me and my partner, and she started showing it. 

Every time I failed to keep an erection she adopted a pissy atitude and mocked me in a passive agressive fashion. This included, but was not limited to, blaming her poor performance in track and field on my poor performance in bed, saying I couldn't satisfy her enough to keep her focused in races. Yup. 

The final blow was dealt to my confidence with her cheating on me. She told me flat out it was because I was bad at sex. We broke up and I went to college. I avoided approaching girls for the fear that I would disappoint them with a flaccid penis. I replaced my feelings of inadequacy with an incredible amount of masturbation and the accompanying feelings of self-disgust. 

Then out of the blue, as if delivered to me by Ron Jeremy himself, I discovered BDP. I learned that I was as wide as a boat, and that condoms shouldn't feel like boa constrictors. As if by a miracle, I not only had a perfectly resolvable answer to why I couldn't keep an erection, but also I had a big dick! It was a complete 180 for my confidence. I went out and got myself a box of XLs, a beautiful and loving girlfriend, and an incredible sex life. Hot damn, she does not mind the extra size either. 

I can't thank BDP enough. This is my first post but definitely not my last!

TL;DR Wore regular condoms that killed boners. Bitchy girlfriend was a bitch: confidence destroyed. WHOA, I have a big dick. Bought big condoms. Got new girlfriend. Life is good. "	t5_2sqd6	True

I met this friend as he is my mother's friend's son, so we got to know each other pretty well when we were young and taken to one-another's houses by our parents wanting to meet up. Fast forward 10 years we are still friends but meet up independently of our parents who have dinner parties etc. So... On one night when me and my friend are chilling out, shortly after one of the dinner parties he mentions to me that my mother had been pretty drunk, ""No news there!"" I responded laughing, not in the slightest surprised. He went on to say ""Yeahhh... Welll... She was telling all her friends, my mum included, that you're hung like a donkey."" Now I usually take compliments pretty well, but hearing my own mother had been talking about it was horribly embarrassing and incredibly uncomfortable. My Friend has since told some of his other friends (as he of course finds this hilarious) and it's brought up on a fairly regular basis, I still haven't got over it.

The bar AC hasn't been working and the city's been record-high hot lately. So I've taken to going commando or wearing thin cotton work slacks, figuring my apron would always counter any issues I might have. As my brothers here know, clothing is a bane or a boon.

Chance happens that a beautiful, charming, and (as I later found out) married foreigner sits at my bar. I try to turn on the charm, and it works, a little. She doesn't speak much English. I get by on my French for her Portuguese and things are okay. The night goes on.

We get crowded. I start cranking out drinks for our service bar. We're a 500 person restaurant as well, so I'm also slinging the stuff to make chocolate milks and Shirley Temples. It's around this time that one of the servers pitches a tupperware of chocolate sauce back at me over the counter and coats my apron.

In my ignorance, I doff it. The night goes on. I chat with the foreigner. She is noticeably more attuned. It's at this point that I feel some stirrings and realize that NoFap Day 15 is a poor day to go tempting fate. She waits four hours for me to close the bar, wipe everything down, and count my cash drawer. I comp her three beers. We go get a fifth of whiskey. I drink bouts of it. We get drunk and fool around, but it doesn't get past second before we're asleep like children.

Then we wake up not an hour later and I realize I'm all hands on deck and slowly forcing her thighs apart. The ""oh my god."" The act. The reprises. The night goes on. In the morning, we do another two run-throughs to be sure we've got it right and head out for a breakfast. ""A little breakfast,"" she says. ""Only toasts."" Or what sounds like Brad. I get a cup of black coffee and smile at the reservoir in the sprawl of a city park while she tells me I have ""the face of a boy and the body of a man."" She explains it was my ""delicious"" part that enticed her to take me to her hotel. And also to take off her wedding ring before all this transpired. She pulls it out, bashful, and asks: ""That is no problem for you?""

Well we also had serious discussions in mind, but we mostly just wanted to make dick jokes. A year later and well... we've done things, Gentlemen. Good things, I think. There are actually people here, a collection of people which form (dare I say it) a community. Thank you all for being here. You've done a lot to make the place what it is. And now, it's our turn. We like what's happening, but it's clear to us that we could be doing this better. So we have some changes coming up in this subreddit.

**1)** As you may have noticed, the subreddit is no longer NFSW. When BDP first began we weren't really sure what kind of content would be posted there. It could have been anything from a spoof of /r/firstworldproblems to a rather exclusive /r/gonewild. Partly to be safe, we made the entire thing NSFW. However we now feel that that's not really appropriate for the kind of content that gets posted here. In fact, it might even be detrimental. One commenter described this subreddit as being like a ""minefield"" where they couldn't tell what was actually NSFW and what was just text. We think this is a great point.

This does mean that you will now actually have to be careful about posting your schlong online. Feel free to do so, but make sure to tag it as NSFW (Note: I just realized this could be interpreted as Not Safe For Women).

**2)** Over the next few... *ahem* Soon(TM) we'll be creating a stylesheet for the subreddit that actually looks good. I don't care if it's dicks from top to bottom, I just want it to look good. If you have any suggestions for color schemes, themes, logos, etc. please feel free to post them. If you have some experience in subreddit styling and would like to help/offer advice, please message the moderators. We're more than happy to have your assistance.

**3)** We'll be updating the sidebar with useful links and some stickied threads on answers to common but useful questions. If you have a post you would like to write for the sidebar, then please contact us or post here. 

Keep in mind that these aren't quite set in stone. if you have any objections or comments to any of the upcoming changes feel free to say so. We're more than happy to listen. Let's make this place a more comfortable place for all of us.

I was never even tempted to measure myself.  Multiple women had told me I was, but I thought that was something they thought men wanted to hear.  Well, I'm 22 and finally did some measurements after struggling with a variety of problems in the bedroom for years.  At a girth of nearly 6.5 inches I figured most of my problems were the result of condoms being too tight.  I've had frequent trouble climaxing during sex because if the condom wasn't killing my erection soon after I put it on, it was causing me discomfort and after enough time pain.  After sex the skin of my penis is red and excruciatingly painful for hours as a result.  I've never been with a partner on birth control so even when I was in a long term relationship I would always be too nervous to come while not using a condom for fear of pregnancy.  So now I think to myself ""oh good, I know the problem now I can fix it.  I'll just get condoms that fit and I'll finally be able to enjoy sex properly.""  Then I look around here and see its impossible as I live in the US.  It's super demoralizing to have that brief hope taken away.  

It wouldn't be so bad if most women were more understanding.  Most want to use a condom as an added measure of protection (understandable), but when I tell them about the problems that condoms cause for me they act like I'm a creep trying to feed them a line just to get out of something they view as a minor inconvenience.  Or when I use one and don't orgasm, which happens more often than not, they either think something is wrong with me or are hurt because they think I think something is wrong with them.  

Anyway, thanks for letting me vent.  At least I'm not alone in this boat.  But seeing as how there doesn't seem to be much to do I'll just keep holding out for an understanding and committed partner.  "	t5_2sqd6	True
1356679915.0	15kb8y	Complete Big Dick Guide - Part One - How do I know?	MAJORPOOPY	89	23	47	"To preface this guide, I would like to point out that this is in no way scientific. I am writing this using personal knowledge and experiences. You will hear me citing information from my personal experiences. What is written here may or may not work for you. I only have experiences with women...so if you’re looking for guy on guy advice, this probably isn’t the right thread for you. That being said, let’s get started.


This guide is going to be broken down into a few categories. The categories will include things like personal grooming (manscaping), foreplay, sex tips, and other generally helpful information for guys and gals. While this guide will be written for guys who are well hung, the information could prove useful for anyone looking for some light on the situation. Phew, where to start.


&gt;**How do I know if I have a “big dick?”** 

Let’s examine the word ‘big’. Big means something that is of considerable size, extent, or intensity. Pretty vague, huh? In the penis world, big usually means any penis that is of greater length or width than the average. For our purposes, the average length of an erect human penis is about 5.5” (14cm). The average circumference (girth) of an erect human penis is about 4-4.5"" (10cm-11.5cm)


To find out how small, average, or big you really are, you will need to measure. Length is the easy part. Find a ruler and pull out your fully erect member. Press the ruler lightly against your pubic bone. The ruler should be resting on top of your erection, parallel to it. Wherever your penis tip ends along the ruler, that’s your length. Girth can be a little bit tougher. For this, you will need a piece of string. Wrap the string around the middle of your shaft. Once it’s pulled snug (tight enough to not move, but not so tight that it’s pressing in your skin) put your fingernail on the exact spot where the end of the string meets the rest of it. Then, without letting go of the string, lay it flat against the ruler and measure from the original end of the string to your fingernail. Voila, you will have your circumference. *User Hungfun also suggested using a strip of paper instead of dealing with a string.*


If your length is anywhere in the 5-6 inch range, you can safely assume that you are of average length. If you are below 5 inches, you can assume you are of below average length. If you are over 6 inches long, you can assume you are of above average length. Just because you are of average or below average length, does not mean you are not “big.”


If your circumference is anywhere between 4 and 4.75 inches, you would be considered of average girth. Any measurement below 4 inches or above 4.75 inches would be considered below and above average respectively. Just because your circumference is average or below average does not mean you are not “big.”


All that being said, rather your dick is big or not is in the eye of the beholder. For example, let’s say your penis is 7 inches long, but only 4 inches around. For some women/men this may be considered small, for most it would probably be considered big, at least length-wise. If you have a 5 inch penis that is 6 inches around, you still qualify as having an above average sized penis, at least girth wise. Let’s say you are of average length and girth, but you are with a girl who has never seen a penis as big as yours. To her, you’d probably be “big” comparative to her previous experiences.


Unfortunately, the way I just described it isn’t how most of society sees it. For some, big may mean something similar to what they see in porn. For others, big may mean having a certain measurement like 8” long. 


For myself, I consider myself to have a “big” dick. Based off of statistics and confirmation from partners, I can somewhat safely put myself in the big dick category. But, like I said, big is a purely subjective term to whoever is doing the judging.


**Other signs that you may have a big dick:** *(keep in mind, these are purely from personal experience and are not scientific in any way)*

*  You or your partner can’t fit their hand around the shaft

* Your partner can’t fit your penis in their mouth/open their jaw wide enough

* You have trouble either entering or going all the way down inside of your partner

* You cause tearing or other pain to your partner while having intercourse

* Certain clothing items may not suffice to hide or accommodate your penis and/or balls.


This concludes part one of my big dick guide. Once again, keep in mind that I only really covered erect sizes because that’s what most guys really care about. Also keep in mind that much of what I have written is anecdotal based off my personal experiences. 


If you have any further questions or comments or would like to see anything added, please PM me or leave a comment below.

**Edit: Apparently I was using outdated information for average circumference. It should be more in the 4-5 inch range. Also added another ""clue"" to being big and deleted one that was somewhat controversial. (Because yes, women do lie about size sometimes. Not all the time, but going based off of what they say isn't really a great way to tell if you are big.)**"	t5_2sqd6	True

&gt;**Part 4: Positions**

Most of us have been there. We’ve been in the sack with a girl, things are heating up, and right when things get going...we hear words like “ouch, not so deep, and it hurts.” Sometimes, this situation can be remedied by more foreplay, lubrication, and preparing your partner for your size beforehand. Most of the time, we can prevent the “bad ohs” from happening during sex by trying positions that aren’t so punishing on a female’s vagina and/or cervix. 

Let’s continue by discussing why sex can be painful for women. If you look a diagram of a female’s sex organs, there are a few important features you should be aware of. First, you must understand that when not aroused, a female’s vaginal ‘canal’ is only a couple inches long. Trying to have sex with a woman who is not aroused can be painful for her. Once she is aroused, blood flows to the area and it enlarges to accomodate a penis. Even though the area does get bigger, there still is a limit. Some of us longer guys know what the term, “bottoming out” means. That is simply slang for bumping a girl’s cervix. For the average sized guy, it usually isn’t an issue. But bigger guys need to be aware that most girls do not get pleasure from having their cervix smashed by your penis. If you’d like to see exactly where the cervix is located, take a look at this diagram: http://bit.ly/14Wzudp

Sex can also be painful because of a penis’s girth. The unfortunate truth is that there isn’t much position-wise that can be done to remedy pain from thickness. All I can do is reiterate how important foreplay and lubrication are. Even with those two things, sometimes you can still “damage” a girls vagina. I can tell you from personal experience that if you are thick enough, some soreness and/or tearing may still occur no matter how much foreplay and lube you use. That being said, sex can still be very  pleasurable for both parties, even if you are long and thick. I would highly recommend this lube, http://amzn.to/XYnuAM, as it is very slick and doesn’t leave a sticky residue like water based lubricants. It also works very well as a massage oil and is safe for use with condoms.
_______
Now that we understand why sex can be painful for women, and some things we can do to prevent it, let’s move on to some positions! 

&gt;**Cowgirl/Reverse Cowgirl**  (http://bit.ly/12xzKQt - Video NSFW)

I would highly recommend this position to anyone, not just guys with large members. It should be a staple of everyone’s sex life. Cowgirl is the basic girl-on-top position. As the guy, all you have to do is lay on your back and use your hands to **a)** place them on your girl’s butt and help her ride and/or **b)** pleasure her breasts and run them over her body. As the girl, you can be on top either facing your guy or facing away. You can also either kneel or squat, although squatting is much more demanding on your leg muscles. This position is great for bigger guys because the girl can control depth. She is the best judge of how much she can take, and if she feels “full” before going all the way down on you, she can stop at just the right depth. Another tip I would have for the girl is, don’t sit straight up while riding. This will give his penis a more direct shot to your cervix. Instead, lean forward while riding. This will prevent it from going quite as deep and also give him perfect access to kiss, lick, and feel you. 

&gt;**Lazy Doggy** (http://bit.ly/PSWkwy Video NSFW)

I remember the first few times I tried doggy with my girlfriend. It definitely is a fun position, but it can also feel like very deep penetration for the girl depending on how bent her legs are. To remedy this, try decreasing the angle at which her legs are bent. What I’ve found best is to have her lay flat on her stomach, legs straight. Then as the guy, you can enter from behind and use your arms to prop yourself up. She can either spread her legs or keep them together. Doing it this way eliminates some of the deep penetration that can come from regular doggy style. 

&gt;**Missionary** (http://bit.ly/XbBVFq Video NSFW)

Yes, I am recommending the classic missionary position, with a couple catches. First, I would highly recommend not bending her legs past 90 degrees. So called “pile driving” is off the table. Keeping her legs as straight as possible helps keep the really deep penetration from happening. You can communicate as to how far is too far back. Women have different tolerances for depth. Second, as the man, you need to be aware of how deep and fast you are going. I can tell you right now, if you are going fast, you need to be especially aware of how deep you are going. If you go slow, you may be able to get away with going all the way in. From experience, my girl loves it when I go extra slow and push all the way in. While I do hit her cervix, it happens at a very slow speed. It gives her a very “full” feeling which a lot of women enjoy if done right. 

&gt;**Girl-on-top Missionary/Reverse Missionary** (http://bit.ly/57CdMa Picture NSFW)

I definitely saved the best for last. This position was a godsend for me and my girlfriend. We enjoy many positions, but this one is our favorite/money position. Here’s how you do it. (I implore you to first take a look at the picture/diagram link posted by the title. It is exactly how it should look.) As the guy, lay back as you normally would for cowgirl. Have your girl climb on top of you, facing you, just like normal cowgirl. This is where it gets different: once you are in cowgirl, the girl needs to lean forward and stretch her legs out straight behind her. Adjust yourselves so that the guy’s penis isn’t being bent in a weird way. As the girl, you can either lay directly on your man, or use your arms to prop yourself up, giving your guy great access to your breasts. Just like in cowgirl, the girl is going to do much of the work. This time, she needs to move only her hips up and down and side to side in a gyrating motion. If done right, you should be grinding against your partner, providing clitoral stimulation. The guy can put his hands on her butt to help her move up and down as well. After some practice, you and your partner will get in a rhythm and be able to use this position to your advantage. 

Here’s why this position is great:

* The female gets stimulation from BOTH vaginal penetration and clitoral stimulation (along with nipple stimulation if desired)

* The girl can still control depth in this position (but I haven’t found it to be as much of an issue as with regular cowgirl)

* Guys get full access to the girl's breasts, as they usually are right near his mouth.

* Real talk, when my gf and I get into this position, there has not been one time that she hasn’t orgasmed within the first 3 minutes. I kid you not. I would HIGHLY recommend the full trifecta of nipple, vaginal, and clitoral stimulation. The position by itself provides two...but it’s up to the guy to make his girl’s breasts feel heavenly. She will have so much stimulation, she will be cumming in no time.

* If you are a girl, I can almost guarantee a powerful orgasm. I usually get 9s or 10s out of 10 when I ask my girl to rate her orgasm on a scale of 1-10 after she cums. I like knowing that I did my job well.

_______
I know I didn’t cover a ton of positions, but the 4 I listed above (and variations of) are honestly the best ones I have come across, especially for guys that are well endowed. I would love people to post their own ideas and feedback on how these positions worked for you. I would especially love feedback on the last position, as I don’t know anyone else who uses it. I just know how awesomely it works out for me and my gf.

Again for those of you who are really thick, there isn’t a whole lot you can do. I promise that once you and her find a position that works, sex will be great for both of you. I can tell you that before my girlfriend and I found the last position, she would start having pain after about 10 minutes. She still gets that, but now she switches to the last position and the pleasure she gets from that way outweighs any pain she has at that time. The orgasms don’t hurt either.

Anyway, I’m thinking about doing one final (albeit shorter) piece on how to increase your stamina/endurance. If you would like to see that, please let me know, otherwise I probably won’t write it. I appreciate all the support I’ve had across these guides, and maybe I’ll get lucky enough to have them side-barred.

I've been with a considerable amount of men and large dicks *hurt*! Having a large head is awesome, I can feel the movement more inside, whereas a large girth makes me feel blown out and the length, if you're not careful, can just feel like a bludgeoning to the cervix, which is NO fun.

Big dicks, might I suggest doggie style as an opening move if you have a girl that would be comfortable with it: it's much easier to control your speed and depth when you're not fighting gravity. On top of that, when a woman is in doggie position, it's easier to hit the g-spot, you aren't chafing the labia as much with the movement, and the woman gets a bit wider to accept your, well, huge dick.

Use lube, have your partner be concerned of her own orgasm, either you rubbing her clitorous (*gently*, please!) or putting her hand there. Once she orgasms, it will be considerably more wet, and you can feel her clenching with the orgasm--it's like kegels but less controlled (quick, powerful clenches rather than slow, controlled ones).

If you're unsure of how to make a woman orgasm by touching her clitorous, use spit or lube and pull one of the lips over the clitorous--the buffer makes the sensitivity less intense and more enjoyable. Don't go straight for the nub, because if you're with a submissive woman, she won't say much and it'll just hurt. Be gentle with out clits--it's like petting a butterfly. She can always tell you to go harder, but it's embarrassing to tell a guy to lighten up.

BD's, it would be better for you to spend more time on foreplay to get the woman more wet, and if you're with a partner that's been drinking, for the love of god, use lube.. Drinking makes people dehydrated, which makes it nearly impossible to get as wet as we want to be.

If there’s nothing else that you get out of this series of guides, at least get this: if you have a large penis, foreplay is an essential tool in your sexual tool belt. 

Let’s start with some facts. The average vagina, when not aroused, has a depth of roughly 3-4” (7.6-10cm). Counter that with the fact that the average penis is anywhere from 5-6” in length. But, let’s also keep in mind what subreddit we are on... which makes foreplay all the more important. The vaginal walls gently touch when at rest. This is au contraire to popular belief that the vagina is “always open.” Once an object (tampon, sex toy, penis) is introduced, the vagina molds itself around the object to accommodate length, width, and circumference. When a female hits full arousal, the cervix will sort of lift up and out of the way. But, as many of us know, there is a limit to how much space this can provide. Foreplay can give us larger guys the best chance to fully arouse our partners and decrease the chances of causing pain during intercourse.
****
This is by no way a comprehensive list of foreplay techniques. I am not claiming to be a sex master, but instead am sharing some ideas on methods that have been successful for me. I’m sure many of you who read this have their own experiences to share, and they are more than welcome here. Without further adieu, here is my foreplay guide.

&gt;**Mood**

While you may be okay with having a quickie in your car, your partner may want something a little more romantic. Many of us know, if your partner isn’t in the mood, intimacy can be hard to come by. Start by creating a relaxing environment. Make sure your living area is not too cold or hot. Light a few candles and put some soft jazz on the stereo. Try some slow dancing for awhile. You don’t need to be a dancing expert to hold your partner close and sway back and forth. This can be incredibly romantic for both you and your partner. Feel free to kiss anytime while dancing.

&gt;**Massage**

After some time, make your way to the bedroom. (or somewhere comfortable) I will use the bed for this guide’s purposes because I believe it is by far the best place to have sex. Dance your way there, or carry your partner piggy back...whatever seems fun and sexy at the time. Once there, put your partner softly down on the bed. Take your time removing clothes; there’s no reason to pull them off right away. Starting from the head or feet, slowly work your hands up and down the other person’s body. Take note of any extra sensitive or sore spots; spend extra time on those. By this time, you and your partner may be completely naked. If not, have some fun removing the remainder of each other’s clothing. Feel free to switch spots and be the one receiving the massage. 

&gt;**The “Moves”**

Get comfortable next to your partner. Personally, I like to start with the covers on. Kiss her, not only on the lips, but on her forehead, cheeks, and neck. I like to “tease” a kiss by going in for one and then just lightly brushing my bottom lip across hers and pulling away. If you do this multiple times it will often end with her pulling your head down and forcing you to kiss her. This is a good sign that she wants you. Continue kissing her all over until you feel the time is right to move on. 

There are areas on the human body called “erogenous zones.” These are areas on the body that may be more sensitive or cause arousal when touched. On a female, they include (but aren’t limited to) the lips, neck, ears, back, inner thighs, nipples, sides, feet, and the most obvious one, the clitoris. It is up to you to either find or ask your partner if what you are doing to them feels good. Some people prefer biting to licking. Others may prefer to be rubbed instead of kissed in certain areas. Pay attention to your partner’s reactions when making contact with these areas. A lot of men go straight for the nipples or clitoris...and while those may feel amazing for her, don’t ignore the rest of the zones! Our goal here is to cause maximum pleasure and arousal for our partners!

One of the best tips I can give is to mix things up. If you are licking her nipples, don’t just suck on them for 5 minutes. Flit your tongue over them lightly, change up the direction in which you are licking them, bite them softly. Same goes for other erogenous zones. When you reach her pubic area, don’t just go attacking her clitoris. Spend a bit of time teasing her. Kiss and lick her inner thighs. Make a trail with your tongue from her knee to just below her clitoris. Swirl your tongue around her labia, but conveniently “forget” to lick her clitoris. After awhile she will be squirming and begging you to pay attention to her spot. 

When that happens, you can now pounce on her love button. Don’t go too hard though. I’ve found that licking or rubbing too hard can sometimes cause a little bit of desensitization to happen which could make it harder for her to reach climax later on. Just as with her nipples, mix things up. If she likes a finger or two to be inserted, do it gently. Lastly, don’t feel like once you reach her vagina that you can’t go back to other spots on her body. The most important thing is that you keep your partner happy and in pleasure. How you go about it is really up to you.

Some women get extremely wet when aroused. Others don’t. If you are unsure whether she is ready to have sex, just ask. Many times, she will tell you when she’s ready for you. I find few things sexier than when my girlfriend says things like, “I’m ready for you, or I want your cock inside of me NOW.” Some women take longer than others to get aroused enough for intercourse. Again, be patient. Enjoy pleasing your partner because I promise that if she is fully ready for you, your sex will be much more pleasurable for the both of you.
&gt;**Communication**

Don’t be afraid to communicate. Communication is key to a great sex life. Once you and your partner know exactly what they like, your sexual experience will improve exponentially. Also, don’t be afraid of failure. If it’s your first time with a girl, you’re not going to be an expert. Give it some time and things have a way of working themselves out. I remember the first time my gf and me got intimate. We were both nervous which caused us both to be a little tense. Things didn’t go as well as we had in our mind. Fast forward to maybe 3 or 4 times later, and I had just given her her first orgasm. Fast forward to today (~200 times) and we both know each other’s sweet spots. I can bring her to her first climax in under 2 minutes and she gives me the most amazing orgasms each and every time. Moral of the story: be patient, and don’t lose confidence just because things don’t go as well as planned.

**Other stuff**

* If you don’t know where the clitoris is, I advise that you study up on some human anatomy. Some girls' are really pronounced, others are quite small. The best way I can describe it is it’s like a small pea. It’s under the clitoral hood which is located below the mons pubis. Once you find it the first time, you shouldn’t have any troubles after that. If you are having troubles in the moment, just have her guide you. She’ll most likely understand!

* Some girls enjoy having their g-spot stimulated. None of the females I have been with have gotten much stimulation out of it, but if you’d like to know more about it, look here: http://bit.ly/MomJD

Phew. I’m sure I could write MUCH more on the subject, but unfortunately, my time is limited. I am counting on you guys and gals to post your own tips, tricks, and experiences below so that others may benefit. I recognize that this guide is fairly vanilla. Each and every couple is going to have things that they enjoy and dislike. I am simply trying to provide a template for foreplay success if you are new to it or are looking for some ideas. This guide is obviously skewed towards a male point of view, as it is entirely devoted to the pleasure of the female body. I also have not covered any sort of ass play as it is not something me or my partners have ever been into.

Finally, I cannot stress how important communication is to a successful sex life. This guide may be great for some and a complete waste for others. Until you take the time to find out exactly what drives your partner wild, you won’t be taking full advantage of your skills. 

This guide wasn’t very BDP exclusive, as with the previous one, but guys of all shapes and sizes should know how to pleasure their woman. Guys that are well hung need to especially take notice of foreplay. I can assure you that it is totally worth the time and effort.

I am not saying that this assertion is 100% false, I am certain that some of us really do luck out and find size-queens or loving partners or can now attend gyms without fear; 

HOWEVER, as a rule of thumb this assertion cannot implicitly be understood to be Fact. As it happens for me personally, my size rarely if EVER plays a factor in how I approach dating, women, or rivalries. Remember this is just personal experience and not universal, but it seems to me that in many ways (including the size of your dick) that once you know you have something, it ceases to be relevant as a cause for concern. For instance, I'm sizeable according to statistics, but this does nothing to assure me that deep down I'm actually an ethical and morally positive individual. It doesn't make me go to charities. It doesn't make me adopt a puppy. It doesn't improve the *quality* of my relationships, because the size of my dick reflects absolutely NOTHING about my character, and *I wish people stopped assuming that it does.*

About a month later we got back onto the topic again and I mentioned the toilet paper roll test and asked her if she thought that was big and she said that was huge.... Here is the problem. A toiler paper roll is 5.5"" in circumference. 5.5"" doesn't even make it into the B-Level of ""Very Satisfying"" on the chart. She is saying the toilet paper roll is huge but that she would like an extra INCH in circumference from the chart... I think its just an issue that she doesn't know what 6.5 inches is; she is bad at estimating. Incidentally so are all the other girls I've had this conversation with lol, and that's been about four.

It's pretty much well known among my circle of friends that I have a large member. No big deal really, except when they bring it up an inappropriate times. But around other guys, we're all pretty straight forward about the penis.
BUT at work it's a whole separate issue entirely. There is absolutely nothing worse then lecturing in front of your class and catching student's staring at my sidepipe. Or some females in my class pointing it out to other girls in the class, and then end up with a group of girls just waiting for me to stand up from behind my desk.  My bulge is a constant concern, and I am constantly ""streamlining"" my junk so you can't tell.  
Honestly, there is a double standard when it comes to teachers.  If I was the attractive female teacher, then it's not that big of a deal. But, as the young attractive male teacher (I'm 26, black, and in pretty good shape), ANY sort of female attention is unacceptable.

1367186181.0	1dao2c	Why my risqué hot dog vendor costume didn't work.	hungfun	83	24	24	"This is just a stupid BDP story. Some years ago, I saw this scene from Bachelor Party: [(Kinda NSFW. Skip to 4:40. Tom Hanks has a male stripper deliver a ""hot dog"" on a tray to a woman as a prank.)](http://vimeo.com/26861233) I laughed when she grabs the ""foot long,"" doesn't notice, and keeps yanking confusedly while he's being jerked forward.

I wanted to combine a hot dog vendor costume with this idea for a risqué Halloween  party. The idea was that at first glance, I'm simply a baseball stadium hot dog vendor. Unless you looked closer, you wouldn't see anything odd. 

To test it out, I got a tray, some buns, and a couple of regular hot dogs. I rigged some hooks and straps, and had the tray working. I made a liner, trying to get it all to blend in. I figured out how to attach it to my belt. I then put hot dogs on either side, with myself in the middle, and it worked! All I needed was to make one of those paper hats, and I was done!

So, a friend was hosting a Halloween party soon. I didn't know if I could wear this, but I was considering it. So I took a photo, blurred my member in Photoshop, and attached it to an email asking her about the costume idea.

Afterwards, I looked at the photo again, and I noticed I was *way* bigger than the hot dogs. It was supposed to blend in, but it didn't, at all! Even in the blurred version, it looked nothing like the others. Even if squinted my eyes and leaned back, it *still* wasn't believable!

I'd have to buy Polish sausages or bratwurst or something. I'd also have to buy larger buns. How annoying. I thought I was almost done, but now I'll have to go grocery shopping just for this stupid costume.

So I'm sorry if it's a let down, but while she thought it was amusing, I couldn't really wear it to her party.  I still think it would be funny to wear it to the right kind of costume event, but I'll need to be a bratwurst vendor instead.

1364337390.0	1b2lft	sidebar - free larger condoms for BDP	joetheyfit	61	5	13	"*Firstly, thanks to Boibi and the other BDP mods for accommodating this. Really appreciate that guys.*

It's not a ""time limited"" offer, or subject to parting with any cash - it's permanent and open to everyone - hence why we've put it on the BDP sidebar. You just have to ask.

If you are reading the +ve comments about bigger condoms but are sceptical that just a few mm's extra nominal width can really make such a huge difference - let me make it really easy for you. Btw, there's a growing body of evidence to link ""correct fit"" with ""safety"".

**""/u/joetheyfit will send free larger condom samples if you PM him - please note US residents should be aware that current FDA rules prohibit you participating in this offer""**

As it says - if you PM me, I will give you a code to get 2 larger condom Samplers (4 condoms) from [TheyFit](http://www.theyfit.com) for free.

Now.. **critical**.. the FDA prohibit larger condoms in the US (currently.. working hard on fixing that). If you PM me and ask for a code, I am **assuming** that you are **NOT** in the US/Canada, and are **NOT** going to use a service like AFewBucksFwd.com to get hold of the free samples. If I'm wrong, and you do - then on your head be it!

I am genuinely serious about the US thing - we are working tirelessly to get the actual FDA rules changed (they did it last in 2008.. increasing max nominal width from 54mm to 58mm.. we are now asking for up to 69mm) so I will assume that anyone who openly reveals via PM that they are in the US/Canada but ""can I make an exception"" is actually an FDA agent out to trick me and set the process back to square one. Such requests will be ignored!

So - only ask if you have satisfied yourself that you are eligible, or have a loose moral compass haha.

""Can I have a code please, Joe?"" is a good way to do it.

And yes, if you want to sign up multiple Reddit accounts to ""take advantage"" and get multiple free samples then I guess there's nothing I can do to stop that either. But I mean.... really? REALLY?!?!? It's a nice little community here so if you really feel the need to do that.. well, shame on you LOL.

Enjoy the penile liberation, guys!

- Condoms never seemed to work for me.  I was embarrassed that I didn't know how to put them on and remain hard, so I stopped trying to use them.  It's a good thing my first also became my wife.

- Sex-Ed -- mine didn't look like the drawings in the manual.  In the drawing, the penis stayed neatly within the borders of the scrotum.  Mine overlapped that line like nobody's business.  Now I know why.

- Public restrooms with dividers -- I didn't understand why men got so close to the gross urinals, pretty much touching them.  Now I realize they aren't getting close, it's me who's standing far back.

- Public restrooms without dividers -- wandering eyes from time to time (theirs, not mine).  Now I guess I understand.

- Relations with the wife -- She can't have sex two days in a row, she needs a break.  She can't go all night either.  I heard of all these stories of multiple sessions a night, hours long etc., but it hasn't happened for me.  Now I understand.

- Oral sex -- Very short sessions.  She would say that I was so big, that it made her jaw hurt.  I thought that was an ego-stroking way of saying ""I would rather not go down, I don't like it"".  Now I understand, her jaw really does hurt.

The other day I decided to test with the toilet paper roll as I found out on here. Well I was too small and got self conscious that maybe girls were actually making fun of my girth in a reverse psychological way (crazy I know). Today however I found a fabric measuring tape and apparently I have some huge extra toilet paper roll that is 8 inches around and I am actually 6.25... I went from thinking I had a tiny man to getting a little bit of confidence. Darn extra toilet paper capacity making my self esteem low for no reason!! 	t5_2sqd6	True

I have two kids and my wife insisted I get fixed and I didn't really argue given the difficult pregnancies.

Anyway, we drive to the doctor and a very, very attractive nurse calls me back to the room, looks at me and says ""Get undressed from the waist down and sit on the table there, I'll be back in about 5 minutes to prep you.""

So I did...I've never been that modest anyway so I got half-naked (literally) and sat on the edge of the table facing the door...I have big balls and I was dangling pretty damned far that day, plus I was much leaner than I am now so I looked pretty big I'm sure. Well, she walks in, does a quick double take, jaw drops, then gathers herself enough to say ""Uhhh, you didn't see the drape did you? You uh, need to cover yourself with the drape...you're sitting on it...""...staring at my dick the entire time which was funny given the medical field she was in. Sure enough, I look down and there is a hospital blue drape I was apparently supposed to cover myself with...since embarrassment was out the window I just grinned and said ""Well you know, I'll be sterile in about 30 minutes...""

So I realize that this is a big dick problem, but I'm more curious about whether anyone has found this to be a potential damage-causing problem (given that I've read a fair amount of hospital visit stories on here.)  Just to give you a reference point, my bf is in the 99th percentile for length (doesn't want his measurements up), is 5'11 and his penis reaches his belly button. (Also: no downward curve.)  I'm 5'6, but I like it deep and my vagina stretches a lot lengthwise to accommodate most of his penis usually, and sometimes all of it.  So no real issues there (with enough foreplay and lube.)

Recently we were having sex (me on my stomach, him behind me) and he must have been going at a particularly downward angle, where I could feel his penis (internally) as it slid up and down against the interior wall of my abdomen.  I could also very clearly feel it moving against my hand when I placed my hand on my stomach (pretty much up to my bellybutton.)  The only time I've heard of anything like this is when a pregnant woman can feel a baby kicking (both internally and by placing a hand on her belly.)

Yeah, so just wondering if this is a common BD experience and if it's something we should avoid/be concerned about.

**Also please upvote for visibility! (this is a self post so will receive no karma)**

**EDIT: /u/RiboNuc was awesome and [made a google doc to survey the results!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uI4FhtssXYfNqJeuE2fabkWUiZcN1ASU-DUhDkabgws/viewform)** This google doc also allows you to submit your height/weight/age because many users; as well as myself were interested in this. 

So post your results in the link!!  

**ALSO** people who submitted their size in this thread DO NOT post to the survey!! I already inputted everyone's data who commented!! (as of 4/4/13)

**EDIT 4/5/13 8:11pm PST** Alright guys /u/RiboNuc and I are working together in analyzing the results to include height/weight/age. I am going to input all the data into SPSS next week. Sorry it's taking a little longer than expected. I'm on spring break right now and can only access SPSS at my school, but it should give us some interesting/easy to read charts/histograms/averages/comparitive results and other fun stuff you guys will enjoy

However, /u/newgameplayer has calculated the average penis/girth size (from his survey) and here are the results:

**7.18 in length**

**5.40 in girth**

Thanks /u/newgameplayer! And thank you everyone else for being patient, I'll keep you updated on further results as soon as I can but expect it to be Tuesday or Wednesday next week. I'm just learning how to use SPSS so will have to play around with it a little bit to figure out completely

**EDIT 4/6/13 7:36pm** Alright guys the survey is closed! We're going to start analyzing/calculating the results. Expect something new within the next week!

**EDIT 4/9 7:07pm** Just a heads up for everyone, we're making progress! /u/RiboNuc recruited his friend /u/Always_Up_Votes and they have both been helping tremendously with the 100's of responses we got from the survey by converting them into the proper metrics and making a clean excel file making it easy for me to input the data into SPSS.

I have been meaning to update this but just haven't found anytime, I'm going to do my very best to post everything sometime **tomorrow**! I'll show you guys what we calculated as well as a google doc with an excel file showing the results, so if any of you guys want to double check some of the calculations/ or post your own statistical analyses the data will be there!

1357260825.0	15x69q	Gentlemen, allow me to tell you the tale of my worst Big Dick Problem.	KingNick	68	18	26	"When I was in High School *(I am now 22)*, I started a Lacrosse Team with 3 other Gentlemen and was talented enough to play first string Attack-Men.

This story does not require you to know the rules of Lacrosse *(for those unfamiliar with the sport),* but it does require you to know the fact that Lacrosse is a Contact Sport and therefore, like many other Contact Sports, requires the use of a Groin-Protecting Cup.

Now back in the day, I found myself blessed *(and, at times, cursed)* with a big dick *(as many of you Gentlemen have been endowed with as well)*. In High School *(and my early College years before I met the Woman that would become my Fiancé)* I never found the problem in having an above-average member...until that fateful night.

As many of you Sport-Playing Gentlemen know, wearing a cup in uncomfortable...especially for us with larger areas that that Cup is designed to protect. I was *(and luckily, remain)* a tall yet athletic body type: skinny, yet slim and somewhat fit. This was an issue for me whenever I first bought my Lacrosse Cup, because they are sold by body-type...so where the sliding-shorts that the Cup slid into fit my waist/thighs perfectly, the Cup itself was actually too small. This was an issue that I fixed by folding up my junk and pulling up the sliding-shorts/Cup. It was uncomfy, but I didn't have much else of a choice.


One night during a Home Lacrosse Game, my entire package *(balls and all)* had slipped out of its air-pressured seal from the cup and was hanging half protected and half pinched under the Cup. This was extremely uncomfortable and slightly painful, and I planned on fixing it on the sidelines by switching out for a quick moment...

Then the Lacrosse Ball was at my feet.

I reacted instinctually and scooped up the ball and as soon as I straightened up my body, I received one of the hardest body checks of my career. My body went flying through the air and I landed on...you guessed it, my Cup.
My complete package was pinched in between the Cup and my body....which was the most intense body pain I've ever experienced in my 22 years of living *(not counting my Cluster Migraines)*. I will admit to you that they called a time-out to help me and my manly crying body walk off the field in a complete limp. Luckily, SO luckily, I didn't receive any permanent damage at all...but I will never forget the initial and hour long pain that I endured at the hands of that Cup. Damn that Cup to Hell..

1375959621.0	1jy5y6	On the Shower vs Grower problematic, or how maths can rationalize penis envy.	littlechubby	59	8	22	"There has been quite a few posts here trying to determinate how could anyone be a shower or a grower, and if possibly being both could be possible. By giving a hopefully clear definition of these two concepts and using [charts provided by Hungfun](http://imgur.com/a/3r5sH#0) as a basis, I will try to show you what is a grower, what is a shower, and where do you stand regarding these concepts.

First on the definitions. Most often the concepts of being a shower and a grower have been opposed in the popular mind, assuming these two words are antonyms. However as we will see this is not exactly the case. Both words are linked to the penis and its size regarding to the size of other penises, but each in their own way. The concept of growing relates to the difference between the flaccid size and the erect size and how the latter can ""surprise"" the partner, often not putting much hope on the smaller flaccid penis. Being a shower instead is about, well, ""showing off"", notably to other mates in common showers. As you can notice there is no idea of the erect size in the second meaning, while the flaccid comparison is just hinted in the first definition. This is where the dichotomy comes.

Put it concisely:

* Shower = above average flaccid size
* Grower = above average flaccid to erect ratio.

Now let's integrate some scientific data and apply maths to them. According to the studies compiled in charts by /u/hungfun, we can determine what are those average and where do you stand among the mass. For the sake of brevity if you are above 8.85, 8.60 or 8.30cm flaccid length, you can be considered as a shower. And if your ratio erect/flaccid is above 1.78, 1.68 or 1.63) then you can label yourself as a grower.

More bullet points:

* Flaccid over 9cm or 3.5in? Shower.
* Ratio erect/flaccid over 1.8? Grower.
* Can you be both? Yes.
* Are they related? No.

Jonah Falcon, the biggest measured penis on earth with 24cm flaccid and 34cm erect, is definitely a shower, but luckily for his blood pressure not a grower."	t5_2sqd6	True

We have plans to travel the 1,746km (1,084 miles) between us in coming weeks, so we can finally meet.


As it turns out we're both online quite a bit, and happen to both reddit. At one stage we were talking about which subs we were subscribed to, and going through mine I naturally omitted some. One of which being BDP, because I didn't exactly want to give too much away that early on. 


Skip forward to yesterday and I get a message linking me to a reply on a comment he made, which we both found to be particularly funny. Where do I find myself? BDP. He'd sent me the link forgetting that he too had omitted BDP from the list of subs he reeled off! Turns out we've both got big dicks to go along with the big distance between us! Hopefully this will reduce some of those big dick problems, as we both know what's involved in having a large penis. Thank you BDP for making us realise there's something else we've got in common!

1: Self Esteem issues stemming from women saying ""Hell no, you're not putting that thing in me."" Being referred to as a freak of nature is not exactly an aphrodisiac.

2: Blood on your penis during sex is kind of gross

3: Women are just as shallow as men and will talk to your penis without bothering to make eye contact, this only sounds cool to people with small penises because it never happens to them all the fucking time

4: Your dick hits the toilet bowl water if you're not careful and then you have to wash your dick in the sink

5: Hot days are more of a problem

6: Jeans are rarely cut for such anatomical necessities so you have to buy pants that are longer than you need so the inseam is lower and then either cuff them or hem them that way you can leave your dick hanging down one of your pant legs without getting your cock-knuckle chaffed by the inseam

7: You can end up in sexual limbo sometimes. Either you're the bad guy when you really get into it and hurt her, or you don't fully enjoy yourself or sometimes don't even have an orgasm because you're trying so hard to hold back

8: If you're actually after a relationship, it's hard to tell if the girl you're with really loves you, or if she's just addicted, this can be a very lonely situation

You know, men with smaller dicks have to become better lovers all around, great cunt lickers, finger masters and everything. If you have a big dick you can just stick it into the right women and it's alright, you are done.

Now, really? Have you tried fitting a larger dick in a women without making sure she is warmed up? Going deep before the uterus is elevated? I think having a big dick requires a lot of the non-penetrative craft. It's pretty rare to find someone you can just penetrate and go. I mastered cunnilingus with my first girlfriend since penetration was too easily hurtful.

I have only ever been with one woman. I started dating my wife when I was a senior and she was a sophomore in highschool. We were each others first everything except kissing. So neither of us have any basis for knowing what is ""normal"". My wife is very attractive, smart and personable. I'm a nice guy who back then was pretty much a theatre kid who built stuff and liked technology. 

After highschool I joined the Army. I was a pretty self conscious guy because I was shorter (5'7) and not real built (140 at the time, 160 now). All my friends joked that I must be hung to get such a great girl to date me. I laughed it off, but never thought it was true. I knew condoms were uncomfortably tight because we had had sex, but as she was on the pill, we had stopped using them.

Fast forward to 11 years later. Dr.s said that due to health reasons,my (still hot) wife should go off birth control. As we already have two kids, we decide to use condoms. I've never had problems with maintaining an erection before, but as many of you are aware but I wasn't at the time, a too small condom will do it every time. So after some embarrassment, we did some research and found out about proper sizing.

When my wife measured me, she started laughing, which of course I took to mean something was wrong. She just smiled, ""they were right, you do have a bdc!"" (big damn cock, BDC is what the guys at the unit call me, its also a play on my last name)

So now have condoms that fit, thank god, an amused wife who had know idea as Im the only guy she's ever been with, and a smile when the guys joke and cal me BDC. Cause while they may be joking, I know the truth. And it only took into my 30s.

1362001467.0	19cq60	So - My Wife Ran Into An Old Fling At a Club - Story Inside	HelpMeLoseMyFat	53	12	11	"A little Backstory::

As a man who is both very tall, very hairy and wields a large penis, I tend to be overbearing and often very domineering.

As a young man, I used to be teased because of my height and my beard (I've had since I was 13 mind you) So as a defense mechanism I started to emulate great bearded men, which were pirates and vikings, some others but mostly men of power and of great manlines.

I started to accociate my size and appearance with being an alpha-male and started to adopt that personality to fit.

As the years went by, highschool and into college I was able to grow beyond the surface and start to become more than I ever was on the outside, but I had already done damage. Throughout highschool I was far too aggressive with the ladies in the bedroom, wielding my member like william wallace wields a claymore, not thinking of the consequences of what an 8 1/2 inch and very thick penis can do to a young woman.

I grew accustom to this during sex and never managed to really enjoy it. I thought I needed to be a herculian or Samsonesq lover because of what I had embodied as a child.

Communication, love and coordination is what I've learned. It is all that is important in the bedroom.

I no longer just try to kill her or break her in half with my penis, I make love and allow her to guide it like a snake charmer would.



With that said, one of my old highschool girlfriend's ran into us at a club in the city and I knew there would be trouble. I had dated her for around a year and I knew her to be both bi-sexual and very very outspoken. I knew she would not hold back if she decided to bring up previous experiences... so as soon as she ran into us, after being introduced, she immediatly went into story mode:


""So this one time, HelpMeLoseMyFat and I were fucking and I'll never forget, I remember feeling a very sharp pain in my vagina, he had broken my urinary tract!, I couldn't walk for days, and had constant UTI's for my entire sophmore year of highschool!""

I only ever felt self concious while flaccid, but I didn't think I was ""large"" by any means. I felt like I was around average.

I continued to feel this way until I somehow found the BDP sub. I started seeing number flairs and didn't think much of it. I then came across a comment with a percentile guide. (I feel so terrible not remembering the users name, but he gets the credit.) And it made me wonder... So curiously, I came home today, found a ruler, and went to work measuring. I came up 4"" flaccid, 6.2"" erect, and a 5.5"" girth. And man, once I punched those number in, I had to double measure to make sure I wasn't adding an inch or doing something wrong. To my surprise, I didn't.

So, now knowing that my size is fairly large (and I use that sparingly knowing there are quite a few monsters on here) I feel a significant increase in my confidence. And now I know the girls weren't just being nice, they were being honest. Plus I can finally find comfortable condoms!

We were getting freaky, and I had a rock hard erection. I hadn't jerked it for a day or two prior to this encounter in order to make sure I had a good load to give her (she's super into that stuff). Slipped on a standard Trojan condom, as I had bought them before I found out about this sub and the problems that arise for those of us who are particularly well endowed. It was okay at first, but after a while I noticed that the condom didn't seem to cover my whole shaft, which sucked. Also, I noticed that I really couldn't feel anything, almost as if my dick were numb. I ended up going for about an hour the first time, and then later that day for about 30 minutes, but I didn't come during either time. She got tired though, so we had to stop.

Not only this, but during foreplay she was giving me a blowjob, and her mouth got tired. She was definitely a trooper though. It was the longest blowjob I've ever gotten, and she stuck it out for as long as possible.

I still had a great time despite some of these issues. I made her come multiple times, and she said I was the best she's ever had. Not to mention, she just made me feel good about myself and I truly felt like I had a big cock for the first time, which is a good boost to the ol' ego.

Sorry for the wall of text, just wanted to make this post and say that I truly understand now the meat (lol) of the issue here with BDPers. Next time I see this girl, I'm going to try and get some bigger condoms. They'll most likely be Trojan Magnums or something, I know they're not much bigger, but I figured I'd try them first before dealing with the hassle of getting some TheyFits from Europe.

Since it turns out that male pornstars lie about their penis sizes, it would be terrible to use them as a point of reference. 


A common advice around here is to just wait and see when you have a girl's hands around it, and that it looks so much bigger wth a girl in the picture. I thought it could be fun/interesting to get some other point of reference for the less secure BD's around here, so I thought I would post some pictures of girls of well known sizes (I guess porn girls would be easiest) with big toys in their vaginas, hands or whatever. Some toys are quite well known (I am guessing, correct me if I'm wrong), so the right dimensions wouldn't be too hard to find.

The problem with this is that I watch far too little porn to even know where or how to look, so I thought I would see if the community would be interested. Maybe it's just me who thinks this is a good idea, maybe not :) If you happen to find any pictures with accurate dimensions of both the girls and the toys, it would be great if you could post them.

So I've been reading up on things around here for a bit and I measured myself to be about 6.8""-7.2""  (depending on arousal level) in length and 6"" in width - which from I gathered on here is on the ""larger"" side of the scale? 

Now, I really really do not consider myself to be big at all. We've all seen the videos, I don't think I can even compare to those guys. 

-I've never had a girl ""deepthroat"" it (the only reassuring positive size thing that happens to me)

-&amp; I'm often told ""I'm big"" by the ladies... but it's never anything like ""OMG WHAT IS THAT THING?"" or ""you're HUGE"" which is fine, cause I'm not , and half the time it's probably being said out of courtesy lol

-But when it comes to intercourse, I feel like it just ""goes in"" easily. I don't feel like I'm stretching anything out and the only time I get any look of pain or discomfort or ""push back"" is when I'm on top and have her legs pushed back ...

-Doggystyle - I feel like I'm doing nothing for her...

-And I'm embarrassed to say, that without fail, any girl that goes on top will go too far up or ""bounce"" too high to the point that it slips out. More than once. As if they're expecting more?

Stumbling onto this subreddit though, especially the sizing charts, made me realize I'm actually in the upper ranks. Not as huge as some of you around here, but definitely above average.

Now, the biggest problem I've had was having trouble penetrating my ex-girlfriend. I would spend a great deal of time and effort on foreplay, and while not unpleasant in and of itself, I always felt like I ""failed"" in some way if I couldn't get her aroused enough to be able to enter. Due to this, my sexual confidence did take a serious hit, because ""I couldn't even get her aroused enough to enter."" Now I realize it probably had more to do with size than skill. The hit to my confidence actually lowered my libido and my overall enjoyment of sex, which ironically resulted in me actually being a poorer lover.

most of you know me from my posts about condoms, and sincere belief that making a condom fit correctly is the key to making it enjoyable to use. You probably also know about our ongoing discussions with the FDA/Health Canada to get an expanded range of condom sizes legally available for sale in the US/Canada. The state of play re: sizes is currently this:

######
**Europe**: lengths from 80mm, up to 240mm. Nominal widths from 41mm, up to 69mm (girths roughly 3.5"" to 7.5"").

**US/Canada**: lengths from 170mm. Nominal widths 47mm to 57mm (was 50-54mm until 2008, explaining why Magnum is 54mm), girths basically above 5.4"" are going to struggle (and below 4.5"").
######

Consequently TheyFit.com is only allowed to ship condoms to the 27 EU countries (about 500,000,000 people) as this is the area we have approval for (something called the CE Mark). While we wait for the FDA/Health Canada approval then we simply cannot ship to the US/Canada or.. critically.. promote our product in these regions. 

It came to my attention a while back that a site called [TheyFitWorld.com](http://www.theyfitworld.com) was forwarding TheyFit to the US/Canada. We worked hard to address this issue at source. I'm now told that a new site [www.afewbucksfwd.com](http://www.afewbucksfwd.com) is doing basically the same, sending on legitimate Theyfit orders made at the .com for a fee of $6.00.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE remain patient for a little while longer, if you are in the US/Canada. While I totally accept you are free to decide what to do, especially if you need a larger condom, I really cannot condone re-shipping or mail forwarding. The best TheyFit experience is directly with us - you get my customer service girls looking after you for one, and other things (I believe unique to us) like a satisfaction guarantee, and a 50% discount should you need to adjust your fitting.

I appreciate this post might draw added attention to the matter but it's a risk I am willing to take. I need to, **and want to** be seen to be doing the right thing. The right thing is asking you to please stay patient a little while longer - I hope to have an update re: US/Canadian official sales in the next 60 days!

To preface this guide, I would like to point out that this is in no way scientific. I am writing this using personal knowledge and experiences. You will hear me citing information from my personal experiences. What is written here may or may not work for you. I only have experiences with women...so if you’re looking for guy on guy advice, this probably isn’t the right thread for you. That being said, let’s get started.

This guide is going to be broken down into a few categories. The categories will include things like personal grooming (manscaping), foreplay, sex tips, and other generally helpful information for guys and gals. While this guide will be written for guys who are well hung, the information could prove useful for anyone looking for some light on the situation.
****

&gt;**Part 2: Grooming and Presentation**

Everybody has their own preference on how to keep their nether regions. Some prefer to be natural, some prefer to wax, some prefer to take it all off. Whatever your preference, this guide will attempt to provide some information and techniques on how to keep your man area the way you want it.

First, I think it is wise to evaluate your preference. After that, are you willing to possibly change if your partner has a different preference? 

Personally, I dislike pubic hair. I prefer myself and my partner to be (mostly) clean shaven. If you have thought about this style or are hesitant to try it, do not fear, for I will attempt to give you some helpful tips on how to get it done. If you’re going for the clean or partially shaven look, the first thing you’ll need is a trimmer. I would highly recommend this one: (http://amzn.to/YV8zxe) as it is cheap and has a poweful motor. In addition, I would recommend getting a shaver meant for shaving sensitive areas, such as this one: (http://amzn.to/W6fqgB) I know it says that it’s a nose and ear trimmer, but it works wonders when trying to shave your testes. I would advise against using a manual razor as, at least for me, it leaves the area itchy and can sometimes cause bumps. 

Once you have a trimmer you trust, sit on the edge of your toilet with a small trash can underneath the front end to catch the extra hair. Then you’re going to want to start out going with the grain of your hair. Doing this will clear your pubic bone area so that it only has short stubble left. Once you have shortened all the hair you want, feel free to use the trimmer to go upwards against the grain. This will allow you to get an even closer shave, without the pulling that could’ve happened if you had gone against the grain to start with. You’ll probably notice that you still have some longer hairs around your shaft area, depending on how daring you got with the trimmer. This is where the sensitive areas shaver comes into play.

Take your sensitive area shaver in one hand and hold your shaft with the other. It might be scary at first, but I honestly have never gotten cut using the ear and nose trimmer. To minimize the possibility of a cut, make sure that you aren’t shaving over loose skin. If you have some extra skin, pull it tight before running the trimmer over it.  Voila, your pubic area and shaft should now be trimmed to your liking. 

Now, we’ll move onto the testicles. This is where things can get a little tricky. If it’s your first time shaving your balls, I would advise against even attempting to use your regular trimmer. If you’ve had experience, you can use it to shave down the long hairs without actually touching the trimmer to your precious sack of toys. Like I said before, try and pull any folds of skin tight before trimming. Use your ear and nose trimmer and get as close with the head of the trimmer to your scrotum as you feel comfortable. Take your time! Do not try and rush trimming your ball hair, as you will mess up and cut yourself. Once you’ve finished trimming what you like, you are finished with your whole pubic area.

If you like going further and shaving you perineum or anus, that is up to you. I personally have never tried or felt the need to. 

Whenever you are finished, I would advise shampooing and conditioning the area and maybe adding some lotion post-shower. The first couple times you shave, especially your balls, it may be a tad itchy for a day or two. After a few times the feeling goes away.

**Pros and Cons of shaving:**

Pros: You may feel “cleaner” in your pubic region, your junk may look bigger without pubic hair in the way, the area should be easier to clean, and giving oral may be more pleasant for your partner.

Cons: Can take a lot of time, possibility of cuts if not careful, first few times you may get a bit itchy, and if you don’t own a sensitive area shaver you may have to buy one.

(I use the word “may” a lot as some of these pros and cons may or may not hold true for you)
****
**Other Tips**

I would highly advise you to stay away from depilatories like Nair, as they may burn your sensitive skin. I’ve read too many bad experiences using products like that.

Waxing is another option, although at least in America, things like bikini waxes are pretty much exclusive to women. But if that’s your thing, find a kit or parlor that will do it for you.

I’ve heard plucking is another option. Apparently you can use tweezers and pluck out each hair. The hair will then grow back much softer. You will also probably cry like small baby if you try this method.
****
As you can see, this guide is by no way comprehensive. Most of it was spent talking about shaving because I believe it is the easiest and cheapest method to achieving your desired manscaping level. If you prefer to be au natural, no worries, just ignore this entire post. I am simply attempting to provide a helpful grooming resource for guys.

As always, if you have further questions, comments, or ideas to add, please PM me or comment below.

1354146131.0	13ynwc	Got a huge email in response from the FDA.	Dragoeth	38	7	17	"Concerning this thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/bigdickproblems/comments/13v24r/just_sent_an_email_to_the_fda_concerning_condom/

An email to determine the reason for limiting standards on size of condoms set by the FDA.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o-DMGjZ0Rv2HlEySLsT1qM-BGFeCfle1F-k7IrTruwI/edit

Here is a link to the email in google docs since its too large to simply paste here.  I am still dissecting it since it appears to be mostly filler and links... but perhaps I can find some answers. Let me know if the link is giving anyone difficulty that would like to read it.

My initial email is as follows.
&gt;I am writing this email in order to gain an understanding to the FDA's current standards for condoms manufacturers concerning measurements of condoms.  As a male with (adjusted to the nearest quarter inch) a penis of an erect length of eight inches (203mm) and circumference of 6 inches (152mm) I have found that no current condom on the market is large enough to fit with my girth comfortably.  After looking into the subject I have found some interesting information that I would like an explanation for.  According to your regulations there is a maximum lay flat width of 57mm for condoms in the U.S.A.  This means that the maximum circumference (lay flat width * .6368 = diameter.  Diameter * pie = circumference) is 108.0mm (rounded to the nearest tenth).  The standard accepted stretch for a condom to be comfortable and snug is ~25%, thus the maximum capacity is a penis with a circumference of 135mm.  For a man of my size the amount of stretch required is 41% which is a rather tight fit.  The result is an increase chance of breakage under use which can result in catching STI's and pregnancy while also creating an amount of discomfort that can result in marks on my penis as well as reduced performance and sensation.  Also the only condom I have found at this size is Durex XXL.  That is only ONE type of condom with the rest being at 54mm which is even tighter.  Upon further research I also discovered that the united states is quite secular in this standard.  Europe for example has a maximum lay flat width of 69mm which more than handles almost every size penis that can be found with the exception of a possible FEW anomalies.  My size in girth according to every study I can find is around the top 1-2% in size out of measured men.  While this could be seen as I might be on the anomaly side of the spectrum this also means that somewhere between 3.8 and 7.6 million men are too large for current condom standards, with the largest available being a very small available amount in terms of variety.  While it is understandable that not every man is sexually active and not every man uses condoms this is still an alarmingly high number to me.  So why is there such a limitation for the United States for a product that is so instrumental in preventing unwanted pregnancies and STI's?"	t5_2sqd6	True

It makes me feel really weird, because statistically I'm above average, but it doesn't seem special to anyone. I can't even imagine people with below average length. In fact it almost feels like those people don't exist (maybe because I spend too much time in /r/BIGdickproblems, or because the only people who post dick pics are well above average). Do people with below average length just avoid talking about it as much? I can't imagine how depressing the media makes their lives if they care about the issue as much as I expect most guys do. 

I just needed to get this written out as a way to understand it better. It was mostly spurred on after I bought some 'large' condoms to fit my girth better, and my girlfriend giggled asking why I'd need that size (I explained the sizes are more for girth as most condoms are 8"" long anyway).

He was a virgin and religious so he wanted to wait for marriage, I didn't have the same morals but liked him enough to wait. We had sex for the first time on our wedding night a few weeks ago, and he is gigantic.

I'm not sexually inexperienced in the least, have been with a decent amount of guys, and his length and girth is just way way more than what I'm used to. I'd say he's around 9 in x 7 in.
He's also very inexperienced so that could be an issue in addition to his size. He started jackhammering away our first time and that ended very quickly with me in tears.
Guys (or gals) of r/bigdickproblems, are there any positions that are easier with a well endowed partner? Any tips I can give him to make things easier on me? I don't really know that much about sexing from a male perspective since my other partners have been very experienced.

This subreddit brings plain advice and math to a topic that most are completely lost in.

I know your comments get downvoted or hated on but please keep contributing. I'll use my story as an example:


I always assumed I had an average/below average penis, and therefore normal condoms were for me. Constriction feeling at the top? Must be normal. Girlfriend complains that I'm going too deep? She probably just wants to stop. One night stand mentions that it's big? She's just being nice. 

Well, after seeing a post by Joeytheyfit in r/sex I measured out of curiosity (I'll be honest I never measured before out of possible embarrassment.) I'm 7"" x 5.5-6""ish so nothing ridiculous, but when compared to the average it was a huge shock for me.

Because the comparison is not the point. I thought I was BELOW AVERAGE. I was basing this on what porn taught me, by what I saw in the shower rooms on varsity sports teams, by the boasting of other guys. I didn't even think about picking up a different size condom or adjusting my approach to sex because I was assuming based on nothing but false information.




In conclusion I don't really have major bigdickproblems. I'll play around with some looser fitting condoms, which thankfully should still fit me unlike some of you guys. But that's not the point. The point is GET REAL INFORMATION OUT THERE! Guys are the silently insecure. They need some numbers to wake them the fuck up."	t5_2sqd6	True

Ya know, you've just shared something personal with someone and they don't respond... In that situation I tend to assume the worst. 

Maybe my expectation is coming from porn and my worldview is warped. I mean in those videos if the guy is ""big"" (which, let's be honest, most of them are) the women are just verbally gushing about how awesome it is! Then real life I don't get that.

hi all, you might know me from /r/sex but I own a condom company. Through my work, I have learnt more about fitting latex to dicks than is healthy for a straight guy to know.

A couple of things about fitting condoms to big dicks:

- length is usually less of an issue. Because of some obscure rules (the ASTM in the US, the CE mark in Europe) all condoms have to be at least 170mm in length (nearly 7 inches), and most are actually closer to 8 inches. If length is an issue it's really obvious, because the condom doesn't roll all the way to the base of your shaft. A correctly fitting condom needs to roll all the way the base, ideally without any bunching. Truly big condoms are 9.5-10"" long.

- width is much more critical to comfort/pleasure than length. It's also just as obvious when it's 'wrong'. Same obscure rules mean in the US, all condoms have to be 47-57mm at the opening. Most store bought are actually 49-54mm, including magnum/magnum XL which are both 54mm opening width but have fancy 'flares' at the tips and therefore allow them to use some spurious marketing claims about being extra large. In the UK, Durex XL condoms are 1mm wider than the normal Durex, while the XXL are 2mm wider.

- dick maths : if your circumference is 5.5"" (138mm) or greater, you are not going to fit comfortably in ANY store bought condoms (max 57mm width as per the rules). Why? Well, 57mm * 2 gives you the latex circumference of the condom (it's multiply by 2, not pi) i.e. the 'circle' the condom makes when non-flat. So 57 * 2 = 114mm. Your circ minus 114mm gives the amount by which the latex has to stretch to fit your member. At 138mm that's 24mm of stretch - nearly an inch. That's the limit for a comfortable fit (because the stretching force is reciprocated onto your penis). Any more and you are going to experience serious tightness at the base of your shaft, which is where the nerves and blood vessels exit. This = bad.

- for girths larger than 5.5"" here's the condom lay flat widths you'll need: 6"", 60mm. 6.5"", 64mm. 7"" or greater, 69mm.

- if you fit comfortably in a magnum or magnum XL, it is unlikely you have a truly big dick. You may have a long dick, but it will have to be of relatively normal girth. A long AND thick dick i.e. BIG will need a much bigger condom than a magnum. If you still don't believe that, then here's the VP of marketing at Trojan, who make magnum, admitting as much in 2010: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/business/media/28adco.html ""(the Magnum condom) is the same length as standard condoms, with the same circumference at its base"" Mr. Daniels said. “Some people feel more comfortable with that width, but you don’t have to be an overly endowed man to use a Magnum and enjoy it,” he added.

- the biggest problem big dick guys have with condoms is that people, especially women (who last I checked don't have dicks), don't believe that it is a legitimate problem and instead dismiss it as bragging about dick size. ""But latex stretches"" they will shout - well, it does. In fact a condom will fit over your head.. but there is a world of difference between fitting, and fitting comfortably. As recently as 2010 nearly 50% of men asked complained that condoms did not fit - this means they are too big, or too small so it's not just guys bragging about their size.  The solution is to make more sizes of condom available which happens to be the solution we use for everything where fitted comfort and therefore pleasure is critical.. shoes, pants, shirts... bras.....

I never thought much about my dick size, figured i would be average or something and didn't had to care much about it... So i bought durex jeans condoms or something who have the standard size iirc and went on with my buisness. 
Well, one day my gf said that she was late for her period but i thought that it was ""normal"" for teens. Could happen. 
The next thing i remember is receiving a call of my gf crying because she took a pregnancy test and it was positive. What the fuck moment for me.
Fortunately for me she had an abortion but the 1.5 month of pregnancy and the abortion took a big hit on her and she hasn't been the same since even though i still love her and we're still together, she took a big hit of grownup on her face. And her body is wounded with celulite etc..

EDIT : The condom broke, that's why she got pregnant

I wish i knew... or i would have got some kind fo sex ed about this. She has a lot of deep body issues now and i feel so much guilt.

--

They arrived in 5 days, the fastest it was possible and desperately seeked some privacy to try my new condoms. I got down to it, I put it on and it was as i subtly put it to Joey ""like an angel cock-slapped me with enlightenment"". The smooth fit, snugness and efficiency of the lubrication allowed it to fit like a glove, tight enough to stay on but lose enough not to strangle it.

--

Overall, i would rate these condoms a 9/10, better than any competitors and seeing as many people have relatively close measurements to mine, would strongly suggest you message Joeytheyfit.

Since finally realizing that condoms shouldn't be numbing-ly tight, I've started buying Magnums. Now I'm feeling even a little more awkward. Not only does the clerk know that I'm preparing for sex-y time, but now they know something a little more private about me.

I've noticed a couple of raised eyebrows. Or a quick upward glance at me (to see if I shrug or sheepishly grin maybe?).

Add to that, the clerks at my Drug stores are usually senior citizens or part time employed teenagers.

Any awkward stories to share? (e.g. ""Price check needed!"", seeing a neighbor in line, etc)

Edit: ""Uncomfortable buying condoms"" is analogous to buying anything personal that says stuff about you (e.g. hemorrhoid cream,  lube, pregnancy test for wife/girlfriend, etc). Not a big deal, but I'm private/shy enough that I don't want people I see often to know my business).  I like anonymity. Knowing the size of my dick is not something I want my local clerk to know!

I had read online before that Magnums were too large for most people and because I thought I was ""most people"", I just kept buying normal condoms.

After reading on here about a fellow who was similarly endowed (I think 7x5) using Magnums, I figured I'd give it a go.

Bought some earlier today and just tried them out solo. The sensation was pretty close to bare, especially compared to ""normal"" condoms, which compressed me.

My girlfriend will probably be happy to hear this too. We try to be safe (she's on the pill and I usually wear rubbers -- we both *really* do not want kids) but normally when I've put condoms, especially during, it mutes the sensation to the point where I'll actually go soft, probably because it's pretty much compressing me.

1352438317.0	12wevo	Big Dick Problems FAQ - penis size, how to measure, and condoms	hungfun	46	15	38	"[Over here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bigdickproblems/comments/12vst3/a_message_from_your_moderators/c6yo584), at request of the mods, I tried to make a BigDickProblems FAQ. However, I thought I'd submit a thread dedicated to suggestions, corrections, and additions.

**How do you measure dick size?**

Length is always measured from the top to tip, excluding foreskin. (Sometimes the measuring device is pressed against the pubic bone, to account for differences in fat.)

Girth is measured around the penis, giving the circumference. (The measurement is taken at the midshaft, base, or maximum girth.) 

**What is the average dick size?**

According to multiple studies, the average erect length is approximately 5.5 inches, or 14 cm to 15 cm. Most men are between 5.25 inches and 6.0 inches.

As for girth, the average erect circumference is 4.75 inches, or 12 cm.

**What about flaccid size?**

This varies widely. Some men are ""showers,"" with longer flaccid length. Others are ""growers,"" and become much larger when erect. 

**What about race?**

In studies with controlled environments, there is little or no correlation between penis size and race.

**What is large?**

That depends on who you ask.  If you're above 5.5 inches, you're above average. Above 7 inches, you're in the top 5%. Above 8 inches, and you're in the 1%.

**Do women prefer larger dicks?**

Some do, and some don't!

**Why can a big dick be a problem?**

Just read through /r/bigdickproblems/! From amusing to serious, having a big dick has its benefits, as well as its problems.

**Are there condoms that fit me?**

Most condoms are long enough, but not all condoms are wide enough. In the US, it is illegal to sell condoms with a flat width greater than 57 mm, (about 4.5 inches circumference), and most condoms are smaller than this. According to one scientific study, ""condom breakage was strongly associated with penile circumference."" There are many brands, and sizes vary by country, but it is a good idea to find a larger condom.

*Edit: [Here is where I list the largest condoms I was able to find.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bigdickproblems/comments/12wevo/big_dick_problems_faq_penis_size_how_to_measure/c6yqg8n)*

I remember being in constant pain during sex. But, being the ego driven guy that I am, that never stopped me from showing my lady a good time. It has been more than 9 months now since we started having sex. My ""hoodie"" is showing the obvious signs of improper lubrication during sex. I have ripped my ""hoodie"" from the tip. Everything still works, but it will never heal to what it was before I met her. Lesson learned a bit late. If you love your ""hoodie"" like I do, please lube up. If you get a tear, wait until completely healed to have sex again."	t5_2sqd6	True

I'm quite happy with my size (around 7.5"" and and 7"" thick...there are pics floating around here somewhere) since it seems to be a good balance between being big enough for the girls to love, yet ""small"" enough so that I can fit just about all of it in your average girl.  

The only downsides I've experienced with my size are:

1 - I've never been deepthroated, despite many girls claiming that they could (they couldn't)

2 - I've never been able to go balls deep anally

3 - I've hurt some girls vaginally on occasion.


That being said, the pros have definitely outweighed the cons for me.  I'd stick with something around my current size if given the choice.

Hey guys!




I’m 20, and I recently started dating my boyfriend, who is rather, um… well-endowed and I just have a few questions. I’m interested in what you have to say, advice, opinions, or whatever else. (He’s 23 and we’ve been dating/fucking for a little over a month now).    
I’ve read a lot of posts on here about guys bottoming out on a girl and how its painful, or how they can’t always go balls-deep in a girl because it hurts. He can go balls deep in missionary, but I get really sore after a decent session or two of fucking. We’ve only been able to do missionary, we’ve tried other positions a few times like doggy, with me lying on my side etc. I’m fine when we start off, but I get sore pretty quickly. We use lube, and there’s a lot of foreplay, but I just want to know – will it ever be possible for him to just bend me over and fuck me from behind? Also what kinds of positions could we try? I’ve read here that vaginas can stretch up to 300% but there seems to be some arguments about whether or not that includes general depth as well.    



We’ve made the decision to get checked out for STI’s and stuff, and then to ditch condoms (I have a mirena insert, plus fertility issues so falling pregnant isn’t really a worry). If we don’t use condoms, will we be able to stop being able to use lube as much? Also – I’ve had the mirena for around 5 months now, I can feel the strings, but after being there so long would they be soft enough to not irritate the head of his penis? I can feel them, they feel soft to me, but the tips of my fingers are less sensitive.  I just want to make sure he’s totally comfortable. 


I think that’s all I’m curious about, if I think of any other questions I’ll probably ask in the comments. If you have any advice I’d love to hear it, or even stories about your experiences. It’s driving me insane that I love his cock so much but can’t really take as much as I would like! 

Thank you :D

I have always been pretty open about every aspect of my life, and because of how close I am with most of my friends the question 'How big are you?' comes up in conversations a surprising amount. When I tell people the responses I get take quite a range of responses. From being impressed or intrigued, to disbelief denial and occasionally abusive jealousy. And it's kind of gotten to the stage where I want to completely ignore the question, or I just get overly embarrassed to tell people because of the responses I get.

As most of you have probably experienced, the vice grip of regular size condoms is not enjoyable in the slightest. However, I was at Walgreens today and happened to walk by the condom section and notice that Lifestyles Skyn (what we usually use because of the non-latex factor) had came out with a ""Large"" version. 


So I grab a 3-pack of the larges, pick up a case of Blue Moon, and walk to the counter. The young blonde girl who had greeted me when I first walked in started eying me up way before I even got to the counter. I suspect it was because I look fairly young despite my actual age. As I get to the counter, I placed the beer with the large condoms on top. She starts to ask for my ID, but when her eyes saw the condoms,  she stuttered slightly and bashfully looked at me. Somehow we both managed to get through the awkward exchange and I was on my way home, excited to try my new purchase out. She wrapped the condoms in a bag saying ""for the sake of subtlety"" and smiled. How considerate of her. :)


This is my first time I had ever bought large condoms so I was  kind of nervous if I'd even be big enough for them. Despite statistics, I'm still a little skeptical about my size. My significant other spent the night at her parent's house so I did the ole ""insert porn site name here"" because I didn't want to put one on when we were together for fear I wouldn't fit and be embarrassed. When I felt I was near my full potential, I slid one on. Not only was it was a lot easier to put it on,  no more strangulation = much more sensation! I can't wait until my SO gets home so we can try them out together.


Sorry if this isn't necessarily a BDP, but I thought maybe this info would help someone with not only BDPs, but perhaps they or their partner might have a latex allergy, too. Finding the right condom can be hard. Finding the right non-latex condom can be even harder.



tl;dr: bought large non-latex condoms for the first time, young female cashier stumbled over her words, condoms fit better, my penis is happy.

So I knee-waddled up her torso, making the little fella waggle from side to side. As I slowly inched towards her Mounds Of Glory, she started saying in a robotic voice: ""beep.. beeeep.. BEEEP... WARNING... REVERSING... LARGE VEHICLE REVERSING.""

SLC89	31	7	46	"I've already discussed how I had a nickname in HS and how it's semi-followed me since graduating, but in terms of family, I don't really hear much about it (thank god, right?) except from my cousin's husband. Now, I've been close with this cousin my whole life and since she's known her husband since high school, I've kinda grown up with him and we're pretty tight. So, we often hang out and he's always at family events. 

Anyway, for a while now, maybe the last five years, he's been kinda obsessed with my size - often talking about how big I am, even though I'm pretty sure he doesn't 'really' know because he's never seen it (unless he found some of my pics on my computer ... which I haven't ruled out) and he wasn't privy to my HS nickname, but it's like he has some sixth sense or something. 

The oddest moment came on Thanksgiving a few years ago. I was wearing some green Wranglers my mom had bought me and as I walked out into the living room, he announced, loudly, that it looked like I was smuggling a banana. The odd thing, though, is that I've never considered myself a shower - but apparently I was showing (and I don't think I was workin' the hardon ... that would've been embarrassing). 

But it's just weird all around. He's mentioned it in the past, though never openly asked about it. 

Why do you think this is? Fascinated with the idea ... just ribbin' me ... closeted? Just always strange when I'm around and he brings it up. 

Anyone else have similar situations with friends? "	t5_2sqd6	True
1368238856.0	1e3w5f	When I was in high school...	SLC89	35	11	12	"I acquired a nickname after having sex with a girl who apparently enjoyed talking about all her partners to her friends. I wasn't extremely popular in high school ... but I knew most of the kids (and I went to a pretty big school of about 2,000 students). So, it was one of those deals where I had my friends, I'd acknowledge others in the hall ... but I wasn't going to be elected Prom King anytime soon. 

Anyway, we had sex my sophomore year (she was a junior) and I didn't really expect her to tell anyone. But, as I mentioned, she loved to gossip about as much as she liked to have sex, and eventually, the word got out and the entire school heard I was really big down there. It was absolutely embarrassing and I wanted to transfer because random people would come up to me in the halls and ask if the story was true and I'd just respond with a halfhearted, ""I guess?"" and move on.

But then one of my friends, who was always kind of a dick (but done in an affable way so it didn't necessarily come off as dickish), started calling me 'Big Dick' and the name stuck. It followed me all throughout my remaining years of high school and even though I graduated a few years ago, I still get stopped by people who call me that. 

The worst was when I was with my mom once. She asked me what that meant and I told her it had to do with me being a dick. I think she bought it. But damn if I didn't hate being called that. I hated my body back then, as most kids did, and I really didn't like having everyone know the most personal thing about it. 

I mentioned how people still call me it and a couple years ago, a friend of mine started hanging out with this other guy and we added each other on Facebook and would see each other at the movies when we all went. I didn't know this, but he knew a friend I went to school with, and one day, he posted an Eddie Murphy bit about big dicks on my Facebook wall and I didn't know quite how to answer him. Well, he messaged me and said something like, ""sorry if I offended, I was just told by XXX that you have a really big dick."" 

I didn't know how to respond to that. I guess they were talking, my name came up, and the guy from high school blurted out, ""Oh! I know him ... he has a monster dick."" 

Totally mortified that people still discuss it. I know some will think I should be happy, but I just don't like being known for one thing, especially one thing I don't really flaunt to the world. 

It hasn't made me any more popular with the ladies and I'm not cooler for it. So, all it does is lead to awkward pauses when it inadvertently comes up in a conversation. I don't know how to respond to it and it seems, which is bizarre to me, that some of my old high school buds actually enjoy mentioning it ... especially around girls, which does not ever end well (I've yet to see a girl bite her lip and respond with ""really?!"" - most of the time they just look at us like we're tards and my face goes redder than a stop sign). 

Anyway, it's annoying ... even after all these years and though it's not at the extent it was in HS (none of my friends today call me Big Dick), it's still something that follows me around and I find that the most difficult thing to deal with. It's like I have a reputation and I don't want a reputation, especially when it gets to people who I now know in my personal life real well.

He complains that he's too small. Seriously... It's been 5 years and that thing still hurts when we have sex. So, no complaints from me. Ever. (Also, he just got over an addiction to porn)

I've told him to we will try to lose a little weight (god knows I need to as well. i gained 40 on the pill) and it will look bigger. Less fat, more visible dick. Right?

But he wants to try a pill. I fear it's a dangerous idea. Other than health concerns I have no opposition.

I tried having sex for the first time with my girlfriend the other day (both virgins) and I ran into some issues.

After struggling to put the condom on (I couldn't even roll it down, had to stretch it around to get the damn thing on), I tried to put it in and couldn't fit it in.  

Or rather, I'm not sure if it wouldn't fit so much as I couldn't find the hole.  I could feel it with my fingers and she was soaking wet but we tried from multiple positions and I couldn't find the hole with my dick no matter what angle I tried to slide in at.  She tried fitting it with her hand but no success.

What can I do to fix this??

Some ideas I was mulling over:

* Was I not hard enough?  It's very hard for me to get, well, hard.  When aroused my dick never sticks straight out, its at like at a 45 degree angle.  And not rock hard either, jut firm.

* Was she too tight?  She gets sore if I use more than 2 fingers but she said she didn't care.

My sex life is in shambles, literally non existent.  I can count on one hand the amount of sex I have had in the last year...and do the same for the previous two years as well.   It all happened after my wife got pregnant with our son.  He was born with a pretty serious heart defect and the first 6 months my wife and I spent it apart while she was out of state with him and I was working.

During that time my wifes Gyno left her practice and when my wife got around to getting her pap she went to the local hospital.  This hospital is a christian hospital and as such will not prescribe birth control.  They can preach the rhythm method all they want but at this time my wife and I do NOT want to have another child (yet).   Our insurance will only cover 1 pap a year and with everything else going on (a lot) it's been put off to the side.  Although she has an appointment with a new Gyno at a new clinic that opened up that is not religion based so they will be able to prescribe birth control to us.

I'm very unfortunate to be on the larger side of the girth spectrum (6.5) and have had to resort to buying the largest condoms I can get my paws on (magnum xl's).  As I get older these become more and more difficult to use/maintain an erection with.

My wifes anatomy is on the smaller side of the scale as well, so mentally I have so much going on when we have sex that quite honestly I have actually given up halfway through coitus before and it's caused even more problems.

We have tried feminine suppositories/spermicide but these actually caused us both discomfort/burning and couldn't use them anymore.  I have an extremely hard time putting on condoms and then penetrating my wife with them causing me to struggle maintaining an erection long enough for her to adapt enough for enjoyable sex.  Then when things are finally going smoothly about 5 minutes later she starts to develop pain, we use more lube and it helps for a few minutes and then back to square one.  Finally after about 10 minutes she just can't take anymore and I've been focusing so much on trying to maintain an erection and not feeling much because my penis is being strangled that   I can't finish quickly enough when the end is near.

Since I'm still a sexual being I of course masturbate, the problem is now compounded by the fact that my wife and I like never have sex and I'm relying on masturbation to relieve myself.   So when the time actually happens when we are ready to give it another go everything just piles on top of one another until sex just doesn't work.

The last few times we have tried my wife is now insinuating that I just don't find her attractive anymore because in her words ""you used to never have this problem before"" and I just can't explain it to her for her to understand.  Like ""Yes, 7 years ago when we were having sex more frequently forcing these condoms on didn't make me go limp so fast"" . ""Yes, I used to be able to orgasm faster back then"".

I'm going to be 35 soon, I've lived with a BDP for a long time.  I know all about foreplay, lubrication and patience.  The problem I have is my wife no longer wants foreplay, honestly none!  She's only having sex because she's trying to make me happy but she also knows she's not enjoying it and I think she just basically wants it over with.

Oh and I talked to a psychologist about 4 years ago because of my sexual appetite and some other stuff.  Guess I just needed someone to tell me I just have a high sex drive and it's healthy.  I fear as I get older, my BIGGEST fear is that something is going to happen to me health wise that will prohibit me from having a sex life and these last few years have been wasted.  Literally I have almost anxiety about it because if such a thing did happen I know I'm going to be extremely angry! 

I am at my wits end, I don't like fighting with my wife and when we do discuss our sex life the conversation just feels hopeless.  It's filled with excuses from both of us why it's not where it should be and I really can't take it anymore!

At this point I just want us both to have a happy sex life, I'd go so far as to say if my wife had an affair I'd actually be ok with it because then she would at least have an enjoyable sex life.

So /r/bigdickproblems what suggestions do you have?  Here is your chance to pull experience and knowledge from everything you know and save a sexually frustrated husband!!

Seeing here fantastic cleavage as she bends forward to pick something up = boner.

My very recent measurements:

* 13.4 cm girth
* 18-20 cm long (it varies from time to time I suppose. I gain the extra 2 cm between 90-100% erection, so it's a hard measurement for me)
* This has been measured while pressing back the fat (I am of average weight but I get 1-1.5 cm extra from doing this)
* I'm 5'11/182 cm should that be interesting..

So this is making me very anxious (I'm from time to time a very anxious person). I am 20 years old and I have always considered myself pretty small. Before I measured my girth I thought I had a pen dick (I suck at geometry and thought 4 inch around was really big). The only erect penises I have seen is in porn, and they're usually **very** big. I'm a grower, and before I knew about growers/showers, I was very ashamed of my dick when flaccid. I think that I have been very influenced by this whole culture about fake-bragging about big dicks and speaking about it sarcastically, makes it feel weird that I'm one of these top 10%

I have had sex with one girl, quite a lot. When using regular size condoms (53mm wide) I would always lose my erection. I only managed to keep it up once, and it felt very weird and far from pleasurable (But hey, everyone had always told me that condoms fucking suck, so I just assumed that's what they were talking about). I usually didn't have much problems doing it with her without the condom, except that it was hard to insert it a few times. She was very wet though and could fit big dildos with no problem.

I have these last few days been trying very big condoms - 60mm wide. I manage to get full erection with these on and they're not wrinkled/slide off when it's on.

Still, with all this, I can't stop feeling that I'm some kind of fraud and that the next girl will start laughing when I put on an XXL condom on my dick. I have been comparing myself to the posts on /r/penis (I'm not gay) and I'm bigger then some, but a lot seem to be pretty much my size/slightly bigger. Not sure if this is the angle or whatever, but I really don't feel that big.

Does anyone recognize any of this story? It's alright if I'm not very big, just as long as I don't have to feel like I'm trying to overcompensate.

So, the problem isn't that I simply *can't* cum, it's that I almost always can't cum during sex—oral or otherwise.

Are any of my big-dicked brethren going through something similar? Feel free to share your two cents on what might be the problem.

I am currently sorting through the ""top"" posts of ""all time"" to gather Frequently Asked Questions and compile them, and their wide variety of answers and subquestions, into a single imgur album or PDF or master post or something (I dont know just yet, still on the information gathering stage) that can be linked to the sidebar here on BDP. 

I am proposing to you all the submission of what you think are relevant questions that belong on the FAQ. The following are things are slated to be included:

* All About Condoms  

    &gt; Its too tiiiight (Condom sizing, US options, Europe options, *with links*)  
    &gt; What if the condom's too short/long?  
    &gt; Why are US/Europe size options different?  
    &gt; Progress on the US side  


* The measurement paradigm  

    &gt; How do I girth?  
    &gt; Where do I measure from the base? *What's the difference?*  
    &gt; How big am I, really? (Charts, data, the averages, Volume/girth importance, Foreshortening)  
    &gt; Will I keep growing?  


* How do I make sure my schlong isn't a weapon of mass destruction?  

    &gt; Basic Everyman advice (Foreplay, lube, and more lube)  
    &gt; Too thick (Stretching, positions, tighten with condoms (not recommended))  
    &gt; Too long (Positions, buffering, bumping the cervix)  
    &gt; With a virgin (Keep all advice above in mind, Hymen (ew))  
    &gt; *Positions*  


* Hiding the Bulge  

    &gt; Compression shorts/boxer briefs, extended inseam in dress pants  


* It touches the toilet water  

    &gt; Public toilets? Tough shit. *Your toilet? You might want to learn a lil plumbing!*  


* Growers v Showers  


* Anything having to do with homosexual relations  

    &gt; *I found out that the only difference is that for booty duty, its best to keep the legs together rather than spread. Thought i'd share*  


This will be set up with links to relevant posts and sidebar information, ~~things in **bold** are subjects with little to no information that I could find and~~ anything missing should be brought up. You may comment here on it or send me a PM with the BDP FAQ -subject you're telling me about or ""New Subject Suggestion""- in the subject field. You can expect completion in about two and a half weeks time should I get community support. 

Edit 1 &amp; 2 - Refined the list of FAQs I have found and ~~I fucking hate markdown~~ formatting completed yay

Edit 3 - cleared out the bold formatting for stuff I obtained info on and added what's new on the faq in *italics*. Still curious if there's anything i should add"	t5_2sqd6	True

Me: ""Nah, I quit a couple of months ago because of my college schedule, i'm trying to look for a new job.""

Cousin: ""Well, you could always do some porn if you want, ha ha.""

Me: ""Yeah, I'm not really properly equipped for that.""

1358973950.0	1756uf	Any tricks for finishing quicker?	ogreatsnail	27	6	25	"Married guy here, ten years going on eleven, been with her half my life counting dating for six years or so. At the start of the sexual part of the relationship (after we married), things were very brief, because she had to adjust to the size. Usually, I'd finish off myself to save her from pain. Two oops babies later, and that's no problem any more, and she's finally able to enjoy it fully. We're off birth control for the sake of her enjoyment as well- it really dried her up and made things uncomfortable again. Without protection, I have great control, so there haven't been any scares, but with protection it's nearly impossible for me to finish.

After doing a lot of... introspective research, I've found a few tricks to shorten the trip, but they really don't apply to active sex- they involve finding certain muscles and relaxing them internally, but during active intercourse, they won't loosen up. We've discovered a position that works well, sitting up, her taking the action, but haven't tried it with protection just yet.

Noyes654	27	8	17	"Recently had a ""friend"" mail me a dozen TheyFit condoms from over the pond and on a completely unrelated note, I have had a successful experience with www.afewbucksfwd.com. After a week and a half, I finally found that beaten up parcel stuffed in my mailbox and rushed right home with the lady. Upon opening, I immediately wanted to compare visually a sealed TheyFit with a sealed Magnum and to be honest, after only ever seeing the Magnums my whole life (and attempting to use them, resulting in failure to maintain erect every time), the size of the TheyFit was actually a little intimidating and I thought I got it sized too big. Decided what the hey, and hit the hay with my girlfriend. After going through our usual foreplay routine to get her ready, I whipped out the package and slipped that sumbitch on. Needless to say, with zero constriction and a stiff pork sword at the ready, we went at it. Despite all my worries about it being too big and having it fall off, I soon decided after ravaging my partners lady bits at all angles for a good half hour that this would not be an issue. That condom held on like a champ and as I reached the end, I realized this meant I didn't have to pull myself out and the resultant orgasm was unlike anything I've ever felt.

Guys, if you've been struggling with condoms or don't realize they shouldn't be constricting you at all and that's all you've ever known, get your ass to [TheyFit](http://www.theyfit.co.uk/pages/fitkit) and size yourself up (honestly) and I promise you won't be disappointed.

I do realise this might be better placed in r/sex or r/relationships, but I figured I might get better answers here. 

I am 34 and with a guy who has a big dick. Sadly, he doesn't know it. He thinks it is just flattery when I tell him. 

We tried to have sex several times, but in 80% of all cases he couldn't even enter me, he slipped off. His penis would go everywhere but in. :( 

My problem is that up until I met him I was a virgin. More by choice than by lack of opportunity. I wanted somebody who I really admired, who I cared about and who would wait until I was ready; somebody who was interested in a relationship and not somebody who was after a cheap fuck. 

Well, you don't get to 34 without at least some experience, especially not in this age of internet porn. (Plus, I am a bit of a researcher and like to go into things well-prepared and armed with knowledge.) So he didn't quite believe me when I told him I was a virgin, bc of my age and bc I didn't quite act like one until he tried to go to town. :/

Due to medical issues I would really like to avoid using hormonal birth control. I thought about an IUD until I read around this subreddit a bit. Also keeping STDs in mind (I am really scared about that and IMO with good reason) we have been relying on condoms. Luckily we live in Europe, so getting the 69mms ones hasn't been a problem. We tried the 64mms ones and they were too small. He got erection problems with those. 

I read this could be bc the condoms were cutting off the bloodflow??  

I now got a package of 69 mms ones for trial when I see him again. But I fear we need 72mms ones, which aren't even made. (Yes, his girth is that large.) 

He has been married for over 10 years and got a divorce a while back,  until he met me condoms had never been an issue for him. His attitude was simply not to use them. (Yet another reason I insist on them.) 

Any tips on how to deal with this situation regarding condoms? How do I best talk to him about getting tested for STDs? 

We have a sort of a long-distance relationship, so there are long times when I don't see him. My anxiety is that he might cheat and pick something up in between. I know that not all men are like that, but I have this thing of attracting the wrong sort and have been treated like shit before.  

What have you done or what would you do in a similar situation? Any tips?

Also, using my hands as a scale, I am reasonably sure that his girth is wider than his length. This is a problem because the few times he got in, he slipped out again when he tried pull back slightly to move. Changing positions is also almost impossible, he would slip out and then not be able to get in again. When I sit on his lap facing him with his face in my tits, his penis cannot reach my parts, even when fully erect. We are both large people so this complicates things. 

Any tips on positions that would work better than others?  

His penis is also a funny shape, it is almost like you placed two dicks next to each other and covered them with skin. Is there any way to turn that it would make it easier for him to enter me? 

I waited all my life for this guy, I am gagging for some action, it is so frustrating that this part of our relationship is going less than well. :( So thanks for all the help in advance."	t5_2sqd6	True

We are the subreddit of size, and it matters deeply to us.  


I ask you to reach out to others, and tell them how our size matters.  Tell them there is a place they can go to talk to others about the size of their penis, and they do not need to hide it!  If people laugh, ask them to read and understand; /r/bigdickproblems exists as a place where anyone may come.  Opinions and solutions are often found in members that are not directly linked to an issue.  Those that can see outside the box bring new insight that will be immeasurably helpful.  


Do me a solid and spread the word of /r/bigdickproblems so others may enter.  People need to be aware of just how big we are, and how big we can be.  We must thrust forth with all our might, despite what others will say.  Our journey will be long and painful, but we must come out on top in this—there is no other way.  We must quell this threat when it is still small, as we all know who the bigger men are here.


PS: Remember, we do not harbor any ill will against /r/mechanicalkeyboards.  We might often think with one head instead of the other, but they are still friendly people like us.

(jejusauna.com) On the men's side they have a steam sauna, dry sauna, hot/warm/cold pools, showers, etc. You **have** to be naked to use the pools, or get yelled at by employees for contaminating the water. The first few times I went I felt so liberated, being able to walk around naked, moving from pool to pool. Then I started catching men staring at my size, with either a look of envy or jealousy. Either way, when they noticed that I caught them staring (by means of accidental eye contact) it'd make me incredibly uncomfortable. The last time I went I was approached by two guys, separately, where the conversation started off casual enough but ended up leading to the question ""So, are you interested in men?""

I hope I don't come across as homophobic, but being approached like that (naked, sitting next to a pool with like 20 other men in the room) was the most awkward I've ever felt in my life. I could hardly even manage to say that I'm interested in women. I just... didn't see it coming, I guess. This may seem sad or pathetic, but it kinda made me afraid to go back.

1354992785.0	14iae7	I visited a condomerie (condom shop) in Amsterdram that sells sizes not available in the states. Here's what I picked up.	bigdickbro	28	8	5	"I've read a lot of talk on here about the limited range of condom sizes available here in the states, so when I visited Amsterdam recently, I thought it would be worthwhile to do some looking around. I found the [Condomerie](http://condomerie.com/), a specialty condom shop. 

They have all kinds of cool stuff, but of interest here is the sizing scale they came up with for condoms. They call it CAS ""Condomerie Amsterdam Scale"" and it ranges from 1-9, 4 being about average. Because manufacturers in Europe are not restricted in their ability to bring to market condoms with larger nominal widths, I thought I'd have better luck finding a condom that fits me well.

Check out their [sizing tool.](http://condomerie.com/condooms-op-maat) I thought it was very cool that they have devoted time and effort to bringing technology to the issue of properly sizing condoms. Punch in your measurements, it will tell you your size in their scale, boom. No more dicking around. (Get it?)

I was candid with the sales girl there, and she laid out their sizing scheme. [(Here she is demonstrating the twist trick.)](http://condomerie.com/film-gebruiksaanwijzing-condooms) She put together a sampler pack for me to try out which was full of brands I had never seen before. I didn't get around to trying them out until I was back in the states.

I left with a sampler of their sizes 6, 7, and 8. After some real-world testing, I'm a 7 or an 8. This corresponds to a 60-64mm nominal width, both of which are bigger than what is available in the US. The sizing scale used by the shop is a bit idiosyncratic, but it's useful for grouping together different makes/models that do not otherwise clearly list their width, or have their own scales (large, xxl, maxx, etc).


Here are [photos of the wrappers](http://imgur.com/a/9ths5#0) of what I got, in case anyone wants to track down specific models.
I highly recommend checking out the shop if you pass through Amsterdam, or otherwise contact them to see if they can put together a package for you. They really deserve the business.

1353998848.0	13v24r	Just sent an Email to the FDA concerning condom sizes	Dragoeth	30	10	10	"&gt;I am writing this email in order to gain an understanding to the FDA's current standards for condoms manufacturers concerning measurements of condoms.  As a male with (adjusted to the nearest quarter inch) a penis of an erect length of eight inches (203mm) and circumference of 6 inches (152mm) I have found that no current condom on the market is large enough to fit with my girth comfortably.  After looking into the subject I have found some interesting information that I would like an explanation for.  According to your regulations there is a maximum lay flat width of 57mm for condoms in the U.S.A.  This means that the maximum circumference (lay flat width * .6368 = diameter.  Diameter * pie = circumference) is 108.0mm (rounded to the nearest tenth).  The standard accepted stretch for a condom to be comfortable and snug is ~25%, thus the maximum capacity is a penis with a circumference of 135mm.  For a man of my size the amount of stretch required is 41% which is a rather tight fit.  The result is an increase chance of breakage under use which can result in catching STI's and pregnancy while also creating an amount of discomfort that can result in marks on my penis as well as reduced performance and sensation.  Also the only condom I have found at this size is Durex XXL.  That is only ONE type of condom with the rest being at 54mm which is even tighter.  Upon further research I also discovered that the united states is quite secular in this standard.  Europe for example has a maximum lay flat width of 69mm which more than handles almost every size penis that can be found with the exception of a possible FEW anomalies.  My size in girth according to every study I can find is around the top 1-2% in size out of measured men.  While this could be seen as I might be on the anomaly side of the spectrum this also means that somewhere between 3.8 and 7.6 million men are too large for current condom standards, with the largest available being a very small available amount in terms of variety.  While it is understandable that not every man is sexually active and not every man uses condoms this is still an alarmingly high number to me.  So why is there such a limitation for the United States for a product that is so instrumental in preventing unwanted pregnancies and STI's?&gt;

I will update when I get a response (if I get one) simply so that we can have an understanding of why these standards are in place.  Also I hope I got all my data and calculations correct :/

1350453914.0	11m8wa	Advice needed for a young lad	jinjo_rescue_team	25	7	20	"I got married in June to a lovely girl who happens to be/was? a virgin, and we've tried only a few occasions since the pain is so unbearable for her she either screams or cries.  We went to her ob/gyn, and found out a few things of why this is.  I will give you a run-down of what we've got to work with, and from there I'm expecting life-changing advice that will have us bumping at all hours of the night:

She, as stated, was? a virgin.  The question mark is there since I'm not exactly sure if I've even gotten past the lobby area.  She doesn't use tampons, not even the xtra small, cuz it hurts.  She also have an abnormally low pelvic bone, which means that normal child birth could be an issue, and apparently is causing all her discomfort.

As for me, I wield about a 5"" girth (length isn't this issue, so we'll omit that).  This is, however, measured as of 10 minutes ago with a pathetic attempt to get somewhat erect-- when I'm really ready to rumble, it is noticeably bigger in all dimensions.  According to my previous encounters, the girth is a little bigger than what they were used to, so I can guess maybe 5 1/2"".  In a nutshell, I'm on the higher end of ""average.""

As for what has been done already:
I've given her the big ""O"" 3 or 4 times before I try to stick it in.  Lots of love and affection, taking it slow, lots of lubes, angles.  Wouldn't go in, so I resorted to my fingers.  She can take my thumb, but no more... not yet. And that's a little less than half my girth.  

It has essentially peaked at my thumb, and she feels not pleasure in it.

So, any tips for me?  Looking for similar situations in regards to her low pubic bone.


UPDATE 1:  We've had some success with the toys I got her.  Just a vibrator and the smallest ""First Timer"" dildo thing I could find.  I had her get used to the vibrator first for the first couple days, then went in with the dildo.  Surprisingly, it went all the way in, and could be put in and out with some speed and firmness.  What's more (and probably the best news out of this) is that she actually orgasmed, which was a relief to me.  However, the circumference is still a little more than half my own and still hurts her quite a bit, even with the vibrator in place, so I'll need to buy one that is slightly larger, but smaller than me.  Seems LionHorse's advice was right on point."	t5_2sqd6	True

I've always thought myself as very average (yes, porn corrupts).  Had one FWB in the past tell me I was big...thought it was empty words.  Recently left a LTR.  Sex was good, but she was a milf too, never had any problems.  Hooked up with a FWB on thick side...who told me after that she was glad I was gentle/slow at the beginning cause I was huge and left her sore for a few days after.  Told her I'm just average....she says if that's true she's been very unlucky in the dick department.

So now I'm seeing this very petite girl, who we were fooling around but didn't get to business (interruption leading to show stopper).  But she did give it a few minutes of stroking.  Afterward she tells me she's 'very nervous' cause it's bigger than anything she's tried...and she's very small 'everywhere'...to the point that the smallest exam tool hurts.

I have been reading today through BDP for tips and ideas to help us out...but I'm just wondering...has anyone ended a relationship because they couldn't get penetration at all?  I mean, can't see staying together if we cannot be intimate at all. Is that shallow?

1372647342.0	1heidv	Every showers dream	myles92	29	10	9	"So last night I probably had the perfect chance to flaunt around my manhood but didn't fully capitalize on it since I was drunk and caught up in the moment. 

I was at a party drinking having a good time then after a while we got bored and started playing truth or dare spin the bottle style. You spin the bottle then whoever it lands on has to pick truth or dare yadda yadda yadda. I land on this one girl (we'll call her girl A) and make her lick guacamole seductively off another girls arm. I thought it was harmless enough but still funny. She retaliates by making another dude lick guacamole off my nipple. It was really strange and my nipple was cold for a while afterwards. Time goes on and the she lands on me again. She dares me to streak around the backyard of the house naked. Everyone starts egging it on because they probably didn't think i'd do it. i'm pretty drunk at this point and I loose all inhibitions when this happens. I first strip down to my underwear to see if everyone really does want me to do it. They all continue to encourage it so I take off my underwear and proceed to stroll around the backyard like a boss then came back in and calmly put my clothes back on. They were all expecting me to be all self conscious and do it quickly as possible and couldn't believe I was so calm. 

Afterwards I thought to myself, ""FUCK you should've gotten a semi first that would've been so much more badass."" I'm not exactly small flaccid around 4-5 inches, but it would've been way more impressive to be sporting 6+ inches around like it's nothing. You don't really get chances to flaunt your stuff around without being an ass so it's a bit of a bummer. A few of the girls there were semi attractive and it may have helped open a few doors. Oh well, it might happen again.

Quick facts: We do use lube. Yes, good lube. Yes, a lot of it. We also have to use condoms, which is too bad for both of us, but ultimately the only solution. I'm a masochist, but live in CONSTANT FEAR of getting cerved. I will stop everything if I get hit in the cervix and have thrown up over it before. Not sure if it's just a me thing or there's a hormonal reason for it (I've got crazy hormones), but it's a real problem. 

When we first started having sex, I was pretty taken aback when he took off his pants. I immediately rallied and blew him, but it wasn't until days later that we had sex. Even then, I told him, ""Well... let's give it a try!"" and we went through a half-dozen positions before I finally tapped out. He hadn't been with many people and didn't know his cock was huge, so he wasn't sure what to do. 

Eventually, through repeated sexual interactions, it at least was nice. We had a great sex life for a while. I mean, it kind of always hurts, but it felt good anyway. I actively wanted his cock.

Then hormonal birth control destroyed everything and we didn't have sex for six months.

Now my libido is back, but I never want to have penetrative sex anymore because it HURTS. I've got six months of no sex under my belt-- and not just no sex, but no sexual activity-- and things are wicked tight up in there. Even fingering can get pretty ouchy. I still get the craving to be filled up, but penetration is very painful. It's not so much the stretching (that too) as the friction. You know when you rub your knuckles on carpet a couple times and that rub burn starts to burn and sting and *hurt*? It's like that, but in my vagina. 

I've been toughing it out because I feel bad that he didn't have sex for six months-- SIX MONTHS-- and developed a bit of a death grip in that time (PERFECTLY UNDERSTANDABLE), so it's hard for him to get off without sex. 

But I want to enjoy my sex life again, and that means reacclimatizing to his dick. 

What do I do? 

Do I just white-knuckle it through sex for a week and hope it eventually starts to be workable? That's what I did last time, and it was worth it... but I had the benefit of new-relationship-arousal and not being on the libido rebound.

My apologies if there's an FAQ or thread on this-- I couldn't find it.

My story is about my hidden penis happens about 3 years ago (mysterious chime and cloud appears) when I was having sex with my ex girlfriend. She thought nothing of my penis at the time cause it was not fully grown....weird what happens 2 years later. Months later we stop dating......and me and my friend get really drunk and bang a stripper.( not the greatest day but very funny) So i pull out the little guy (Grower not a shower) and then slowly the strippers starts blowing me and jerking off my friend. With in 30 seconds both stripper and friend eyes expand and say ""WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU FEED THAT THING."" It was then that a realized I had an above average meat. The stripper instantly swaps. She starts blowing my friend and jerks me off too see if it gets bigger.....It does and she is now having seconds thoughts about me fucking her. So my friend goes let me go first and then you can carve her a cave. I agreed. My turn now and ten minutes into it she couldnt take it anymore. I stopped , jerked it and nut on her leg. (Walked out like a boss) My friend was the only person who knew until a couple weeks later he tells his cousin, who I am best friends with, that i have huge meat. For weeks he says that I am lying and doesnt believe me.

Maybe I'm just jumping the gun and not realizing that I may have been the biggest they came across? But then that would be a tad bit egotistical of myself (and statistically would probably be implausible). A co-worker of mine and I were talking about it and making gag noise jokes. After the laughs subsided we really asked each other, ""Why do they always make that claim?"" I've never been one to brag before the fact (and if I bragged after the fact, it was almost always in a joking manner). So I guess I really can't see the point in ""gassing up someone's head"". Is it because the ladies want us to think they're super, ultra sexy and know how to handle BD? I tell ya what, if you tell me you can deep throat and end up giving me a knob-job, I will never believe anything you have to say about your sexual prowess again.

One day, we got on the topic of (you guessed it) big dicks. One of the girls pulled a bottle of lotion out of her purse and set it on the table. She said, ""This is how big my boyfriend is.""

I laughed at it. The bottle was probably 6 inches long, and 5 inches around.  All the girls looked at it, wide eyed, and one said ""Oh my God, that's huge."" Another said ""That's so thick!"" And another said ""Oh my God I've never seen one that big."" All of them were in awe.

Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but most of us are *well* over the 6x5 mark. So I wonder what they would think of ours?

**TL;DR** If girls think ~6x5 is huge, I wonder what they'd think of us? Their size perception is very skewed.

Turns out he has a big dick, which is something that I am *extremely* pleased and happy about (though I think my sex standards are now forever ruined...wonderful). 

I can tell he's holding back though. Instead of normal or harder thrusts, he tends to keep them on the shallow side. I've brought it up, we've spoken about it a couple of times and he's told me that in past experiences, he's had difficulty with women being able to take it without being in pain which is why he avoids going all out. Problem is, going as hard as a guy can is exactly what gets me off in the most intense way possible. 

So, with that in mind, have any of you encountered a similar situation? Is the training he's given himself to hold back the main issue here or do size / being cut or uncut also have to play a part? 

Also, are there other ways to encourage a guy to fuck fast and harder besides just telling him to? We've tried all different types of positions at this point. I would have thought that going doggy style would have done it (coincidentally, my favourite position) but again, same shallow thrusts...

My thighs are very strong and large, so even while I'm ""thin,"" they touch when standing straight up or legs apart.  As a result (or maybe just a separate issue), my balls do not hang.  They stay up close all the time, except when I'm sick or warm, and then they get in the way.  I don't know for sure, but I think I have fairly large balls.  Together, they are about the size of a tennis ball on many days.  

As a result of the tight sack, my cock simply lays on top - like a shelf.  The ""shelf"" underwear doesn't really work for me because my balls have nowhere to go.  In any case, I'm 3.5"" long, and 4.5"" circumference.  Because of my ""shelf,"" or perhaps because of my size (part of my question), I often have a bulge in my pants.  When I wear sweatpants, I notice women checking our my package left and right - but to me, it just looks like I'm a guy.

Often during the day, my cock becomes a ""turtle"" - it turns itself inside, shrinking ~1"", and occasionally just making me look uncircumcised.

A few days later my friend and I met with another friend who had been living in Japan and I mentioned to him that I found the condoms in Japan to be tiny. He told me they were normal sized, so I felt confused but kept quiet. 

It wasn't until much later that I realised that my girth was bigger than average, but I'm sure the condoms in Japan were still smaller than other countries, can anyone else confirm?

Not as a fast fuck but like, in a relationship. I've been lurking for some time and I'm very aware of the issue of feeling objectified or used, and as a result I'm extremely paranoid that my efforts to find a trait I enjoy in a partner are, well, alienating.

I thought I'd ask directly and see what you guys say. I'm a guy, and I know this sub has a larger straight community than anything, but I'm sure this is a universal thing. How likely would you say you'd feel put off or marginalized if someone you were interested in seemed more than a little concerned with your size? If likely, what sort of thing would you like a prospective partner to say or do in an effort put you at ease? What would come off as patronizing?

Guess this isn't really a big problem, it's just something that's been nagging at me after a long period of missed connections.

1365816950.0	1c8ura	My penis doesn't feel like it is attached to me...	BananaMafia	23	6	30	"Background information: To my best recollection i recall my penis being the same size since i was 13-14 ish, i am now 17 and a half. Around my freshman year in high school ,age 15, i was diagnosed with ADHD and was put on a adderall regimen. My grades improved and my sexual urges completely ceased to exist. Sophomore year i stopped taking my meds. Junior year, i am now taking my adderall again due to the drastic grade improvements it gives me. Also i have stopped masturbating and looking at porn for about 6 months.  

The issue at hand: I measured my penis a while ago (few months) and it was 6.5 inches by 4.9. My flaccid size is ~ 4 inches. **BUT** on adderall my flaccid size is ~ 2 inches. I'm fine with that. Now to my point, my penis girth has grown to 5.2. Not a huge increase but now if i ever hold it, it just doesn't feel like it should be attached to me. It just feels like holding a penis like object. I can't tell if this ( both the growth and insensitivity) is due to the adderall or genetics. Honestly i don't want more growth, i am happy with what i have.

**tl;dr** : Penis girth grew. On adderall. When i hold it, it doesn't feel like it is attached to me. Don't want more growth. "	t5_2sqd6	True

1359842529.0	17rv5e	Wow. Well hello BDP	RedRoderick	32	16	2	"Hey everyone. 

Just came across this subreddit, and its sort of completely changed my perspective. 

I've never had to use magnum condoms, and I always felt that was the sign of a larger endowment. Porn of course skews the perspective, and at 7.75 inches, I always though I was somewhat larger than average, but not necessarily a ""big dick"" per say...

After browsing this subreddit for a while, my whole perspective has changed. I dont think I am particularly thick (never actually measured), which is why regular condoms suit me just fine, but I have had some problems in the past.. mainly with hitting girls a little too deep and hurting them. And a couple times with smaller girls having a problem going in / going all the way in. 

Very cool to hear everyone else's experiences and what not. I guess I do have a bigger dick. Its not a monster dick, like some other lucky (or unlucky, it seems) guys out there.. but still.. can't lie, it was certainly a nice little ego boost. 

Thanks for that everyone! 

-RR

EDIT  - I guess I should also add that me certainly being a grower (1-2 inches flaccid), and never really having bulging problems unless I had a hard on, also added to my skewed perspective. I've actually wished I had a bigger bulge and been somewhat self-conscious about it in the past...  Nice to get an idea of what else is really out there! "	t5_2sqd6	True

(I think that's what it's called, correct me if I'm wrong.)

A few things have crossed my mind while I sat there. Things like ""Will it get bigger?"" and ""Am I going to have some more serious issues as I age?"" and even ""Does anyone actually care about length/width/girth?""

Now this only scratches the tip of the amount of questions I have, but does anyone have answers to my questions? Am I thinking about this too hard? Has anyone noticed the small innuendos that I have made?

I'm not sure if there's really an age limit on here, but since this is a place about big dick issues, I don't think it would really matter.

**Backstory:** I used to do anal with a ex-gf about 6 years ago. It was my ex-gfs third attempt (all with way smaller dicks). She hated it every time before that and took her a awhile to be willing to try. At first we had a few little trouble with pain/burning sensation. Turned out it was the lube that was causing the trouble. It finally worked when one night we first had great vaginal sex and then went straight from V-to-A. She absolutely loved it (and turned into a bit of anal whore).

**Problem**: Thing is I've kind of forgotten how to introduce anal to a girl in the intervening years so I remember some of what I did that worked but the finer points I'm worried I may be rusty on. 

And before I get all the 'lube, lube, lube' comments I'm ruling out lube for now and going to run with the 'V-to-A lubing method'. Also, I understand the basics of soap up after and nothing ever goes A-to-V. I'd be concerned about going to deep and making an accident.

So my whole fantasy is if only she knew how big I was (I'm not HUGE by all means, but I'm sure that's close to her ex's size that she loved due to statistics), she might want to fuck me. I meant, if she stayed with a guy who'm she didn't love due to his penis size, who's to say she wouldn't fuck me because I'm large(ish). 

I look at cuckold stuff, but that can get REAL weird. I don't like to see guys watching, getting chastised, tied up, etc. I do, however, like to see shit where the girl cheats on a guy with a big cock.

What tumblrs, blogs, etc would be good for me? I currently browse http://hessomuchbigger.tumblr.com, which is perfect (nothing weird), but they only post a few times a week. Is there a specific fetish I have? "	t5_2sqd6	True

My SO says I'm big, but as another thread here mentioned,  your visual perspective (foreshortening) can make you look smaller to yourself.

I've found this little measurement exercise can help you understand how big you really are to your sexual partner:

Get  a bunch of bananas. Pick one from the bunch that looks about the same size of your penis (erect). Now measure it (particularly the girth). You may find it to be (maybe significantly) smaller.  Did it seem large to you? This is the perspective of the receiver of your BD.

Now, with a measuring tape, find a banana the same girth and near same length as your penis. Can't find one? Go for cucumbers...

Why this seemingly pointless exercise? This is how big you are to your sexual partner. This is what she has to deal with."	t5_2sqd6	True

I've had a range of BDPs in my life. Blowjob problems, trouble with sexual positions, sexual pain (me and them), toilet contact, uncomfortable clothing. But I never really considered myself ""big"". Even coming here, I always felt like I just scraped in. I thought women were saying it as a compliment. I felt average. I always was conservative in measuring, because anything else felt hollow.

That said, I really WANT to be big, and like being told I'm big. That's despite the problems. Whether social conditioning, porn or something else, it's how I feel now.

But looking down at the condoms that actually fit me, I feel massive. The condoms look huge. It's quite strange, because I see the condom, and then I know my erection, and separately the two don't gel in my head.

Like most guys, I've watched a lot of porn (although now I'm on a NoPorn rule). I always preferred POV because I could see a lot of them as my size. But some porn had condoms, and I never understood how these penises which I felt were bigger than mine could get a condom to work so well.

Anyway, this was a bit of mental dump. I just find it interesting the way the brain can ignore all sorts of evidence, even when it supports something I want to believe... and that I can still want to believe something (""I have a big dick"") even when I know that it IS CURRENTLY causing difficulties.

1356689489.0	15kg0a	Am I too big, or are my partners just too small? 	djdroid	14	0	24	"So I just stumbled upon this sub-reddit in the comment section of a random funny thread. But now that I've seen a few threads, I'm intrigued. I've been having an issue for a few years now.

I'm 18 years old, and 7.5 inches long, and 6 inches girth. 

Since I became sexually active 4 years ago, I've noticed that I don't really fit inside vaginas, and condoms were extremely tight and made things very uncomfortable for me. I wasn't really concerned when it began, I just thought that maybe she wasn't wet enough, or I just wasn't doing it right. This became an issue with me when my partners would begin to complain about serious pain whenever we tried to have sex, and then ongoing pain afterwards. Now it became a real issue for me, because I realized I was the one causing her pain. I thought maybe my partners were just too small, my first few partners were small - average size, but even when I tried it with larger partners I still encountered the same issue. So, after a series of sexual partners that I've had the same issue with I'm starting to wonder if my size is the issue. I never really thought about penis size, I always thought of it as a sort of trivial thing that too many guys think is a big deal. 

But now I'm starting to seriously worry. My last sexual partner, let's call her L, and I went through some issues while trying to have sex with her. The first few times, I wouldn't fit at all, it was like trying to shove a square block into a circle hole. No matter what way you turn it, it's just not going to fit. She tried something she called ""stretching"" which was her trying to stretch herself out so I could fit. She explained that it was serious pain for her to do and I felt extremely bad about it. 

That is basically what has happened with all of my sexual partners to date. It's also very awkward for me in the bedroom when she wants me to put it in but I just don't fit. 

I'm just looking to find out if the only way I can have sex with a girl is if she's either A. willing to endure serious pain, or B. been with someone around my size before? 

TL;DR worried my size is going to be a continual issue and stop myself from being able to have a healthy sex life 

Are there any less painful ways for me to have sex with someone?

A close female friend suggested that I join her at Bikram Yoga. Basically, you go into a hot room, and do a high-energy yoga-based routine for like over an hour. It's ridiculously exhausting. The class was about 30 people, CO-ED.

Now rewind to the morning time... I had no idea what a person wears while doing this sort of thing. The internet had not been helpful. Not wanting to buy something, I ended up wearing my Under Armor athletic shorts. For those of you who've never had the pleasure of wearing one of these babies... think half-boxer-brief, half ball-securing spandex warrior trunks. It's like, ""Lock down the jewels, fellas, we're going in hot."" (actually, every big-dicked guy ever should wear these while exercising. No floppage; feels awesome.)

While I loved these shorts, they had a major problem I did not foresee: when the material gets wet, they cling to a dick like plastic wrap.

Within two minutes of starting the routine, I'm basically pouring sweat from everywhere. And the shorts get soaked. ""Shit,"" I think, ""I'm on display to a roomful of people.""

Then the instructor, who's obviously a flaming homo and who my friend introduced me to, comes over and starts adjusting me during a pose.

The entire time, I'm struggling and feeling the occasional urge to pass out.

My social anxiety was on overload, and it all started with the damn shorts. bigdickproblems.

Worst of all, didn't even meet any cute girls.

He called me over then was telling me to get my cock out to which everyone else around joined in telling me to get it out. I told them to fuck off and caught up with the girl I was with down the street. Have any of you had similar experiences and if so, how did you deal with the situation?	t5_2sqd6	True
1374451436.0	1is2bc	Have you ever had a bad situation arise because of having a BD?	flesh_light	16	3	5	"So when I was back in highschool I was a skinny, brace-laden, socially awkward, dorky kid. One day during some unsupervised time off in class, my peers started talking about sizes and shapes, making fun of the swim team etc. One of the popular girls I had a crush on (she knew I had a crush, she took advantage of it, I was too dumb to tell back then) asked me to join in the conversation. Surprised by the interest and against my common sense I joined in the convo. After a while I got asked my size which to all honesty I had never measured. I was already self-conscious about it since I have a noticeable left curve and didn't want  another blow to my self-steem on top of everything I had already going on. I confessed I never measured but I said I normally did a double hand grip  - tennis style - whenever I masturbated but that the head usually popped 2-3 fingers ahead to everyone's confusion / surprise. So they asked me if I could demonstrate how I held it because they wanted to measure. After some resistance, my craving for acceptance made me cave in, what could go wrong? everyone did the same right? ... A whopping 7 3/4"" - 8"" that's when all of it went to shit. I was called a liar, made fun of and some girls even asked a teacher if it was possible for a small skinny 15 year old like me to have such a BD to which the teacher (female) laughed off as a joke bringing me near to tears of anger and shame. I wish that was the end of it though. Rumours spread like wildfire, I honestly felt the male equivalent of slut-shaming or living with big boobs. I was made fun of all my high school making me hate everything of sexual nature.

Thankfully when I got to university I decided to reinvent myself, got rid of the braces, muscled up, changed fashion style, groomed to the point some girls started flirting back which made me feel pretty good. On the other hand I was still struggling with any sexual impulse that surfaced. Some people I went to high school with also attended but I was barely recognizable. 

But this is no sob story, during a big party and whilst very drunk/stoned I joined a truth or dare game. They asked me about a piece of info that would surprise everyone to which I responded ""I'm a virgin"". After the laughs and the hollering. I was dared to drop my pants and the girls were instructed to raise their hand if they would want to take my v-card. Even two guys raised their hand. 

TL;DR was made fun of for having a BD in HS to the point of tears. Played truth or dare in university, even the guys wanted my BD."	t5_2sqd6	True

1370301819.0	1fm5jn	23 year old virgin, apparently I have a fairly big penis. Had some questions and this seemed the best place to ask!	walternate482	18	5	22	"I'm about 6.25 inches length fully erect, and 6 inches plus girth. Never realised my girth was unusual until I had a browse through erectionphotos.com and /r/penis and was amazed how well it compared to shots labeled average or girthy/thick. I've grown in length over time, too, last time I measured myself in high school I was 5.25inch, which I thought wrongly was very small.

I've been making changes and gaining a lot of confidence, feeling like I'm getting closer to losing my virginity (finally!), and this has come out of nowhere and really helped! It feels a bit unreal, I've spent so long thinking I'm small, I can't quite adjust to that not being the case. 

I had a few questions that I figured might best be asked here, reading this sub amongst others has helped a lot so far.

* Is my girth going to feel good for a woman, or is it more likely to be a problem and too thick? Are there any techniques I'll need to use i.e. lube, particular positions or foreplay techniques recommended? Is oral sex going to be a problem? Girth generally is portrayed as a good thing, but there are some nasty stories on here.

* Sorry to ask, but are there any recommended brands for shorter, thicker erections? Happy to be referred elsewhere if necessary. Most guys here are longer than me so want to make sure I'm getting the right ones.

* It seems like a lot of guys here get polar reactions about their size, and can't really bring it up. Will girls see my penis as a big one? I know that's a bit shallow, but I'd like to know what to expect, my own self image is a bit screwed.

* Furthermore, can I expect shit from guys if the topic ever comes up and it is considered big? I'd really like someone to talk to about it, sort my thoughts out, but it seems like nobody can talk about it objectively. Does anybody here have a close friend/family member they've talked about it with?"	t5_2sqd6	True

I have a girlfreind who is generally smaller down there and i cant fit myself fully in. But she loves and I don't mind it because it feels really good, but recently, when I found this sub, I told her my strife of my dick because I noticed all the problems that are only for those with larger members. And about 3 days ago we were cuddling when she asked me ""Tell me about your big dick problems"" and so I did. This went on and I noticed she was obviously getting turned on just by me talking about my greif. We still engaged in coitus because I'm not going to say no to that, but I felt as though it was my dick not me that she was truly getting aroused by. I felt as though this was my dominating factor and I was wondering if any of you fine chaps feel the same way ever?

This account was originally a throw away for exactly this question, and I still haven't found an answer in over a year.  I'm also too lazy to want to go to a store and try on 50 pairs of jeans.  That sounds awful.

Are there pants that fit well for slim/fit guys who need more crotch space?  I don't want/need 'relaxed' fit jeans, they look like clown pants when I wear them.

I want normal pants that have enough room for my junk, that shouldn't be that much to ask for.  Had no idea this sub existed, but if there's an answer it should be here!

To date have tried:

Levis 569
Izod something
John Barttlett?
Levis 501's

I had acquired this knowledge just as I had just turned 13, when I measured and it came out to be around 5.75 inches, too young to measure? Perhaps, but I did. During the tenure of this previous year (2012 for the people who havent been following the news, lately) I had grown around an inch to 6.75. Now after 4 months and 4 months being 14 I can grow all the way to 7.5, though usually it varies from 7 to 7.25. So my first question is:

   * When do most people stop growing?

**NEW TOPIC**: 

Bulges
  

 Also, I'm fairly big flaccid, though I dont know my exact measurements its somewhere around 4.5 or 5 inches so I show quite a bit of an outline regardless of the type of undies or jeans I choose. I'd rather it not show considering I'm in the period of adolescence. Especially when you have your second crush (I'm on my third. Which I heard is the best type. Tied with fourth if you count celebrity crushes) staring at it. Its weirder when your best friend is staring. Or your 60 year old math teacher accidently (and I do stress the the accidently, I have a pedophile teacher, but my math teacher isnt) catch a glimpse.

   And it inadvertently goes past the zipper part, regardless of where I originally put ""it"". So theres that.

Any tips?

**NEW TOPIC**: Insecurities

   I get insecurities about my ding-a-ling for completely contradictory reasons.

**TOO SMALL** Sometimes look at ""it"" whether it be erect or not and think: ""It's not *that* big."" Or ""looks small"". Is this normal?

**TOO BIG** I feel stupid typing that out, almost a narcissistic of the highest level, like Patrick Bateman level. But sometimes I feel like it out there for everyone to see. Weird feeling.

**NEW TOPIC** PE

Luckily my school doesnt have custom PE uniforms. But that doesnt stop Mr. Softie! When we run, with the girls mind you, and despite being completely unexcited, it still manages to try to show off. As it flips around from thigh to thigh I notice people staring. Or during jumping jacks, jump ropes, or sometimes even during fucking push-ups. And its, oddly enough, the guys stare more than girls.

  I cant think of any other problem so can you attempt to make my life better a little bit?

Turns out the thickness (and perhaps a lack of lubrication, some girls are drier than others) was the real problem.

As things moved to a faster pace (heh) eventually she started having an intense pain inside the vagina (dem fancy words.) After a few days I had to stop having sex completely and the next day she couldn't walk. 


OFF TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WE GO!


Turns out I had caused so much friction from frequent vagina stretching action that I'd clogged one of her vaginal juice pores and it had become a huge vaginal juice pimple. Ugh. Gross. 

Obviously she was PISSED. Especially when the doctor was, as she said, ""a total hunk.""
