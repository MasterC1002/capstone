1357666134.0	166xyu	Ever had one of those friends who occasionally does things so stupid that it's worth being their friend just to see what happens next? Turns out, that's me.	thekadeshi	578	75	35	"So we've all done stupid crap - like leaving expensive sunglasses behind, dropping our case-less iWhatevers, and forgetting to take the wallet out of our pants before a wash. That's fine, that's part of life. But this morning I managed to transcend the ordinary supidity levels and approach darwin-award-esque levels of imbicilitude. Let me begin by calling to mind a glorious mental image: shirtless Tom Selleck. That'll be important in a minute, just picture for a moment the jungle of manliness he has growing from his pectorals. Now look at me, who's chest hair is similarly impressive. Back to Tom Selleck and now back to me. Sadly, I am not he, but my chest very well could be.

Now, I've recently taken an interest into audiophile equipment, stereos, headphones and other such paraphernalia. As it turns out one of the best ways you can enhance your enjoyment of music, especially in small rooms, is to apply ""room treatments."" This consists of, among other things, putting up some sound-dampening foam on key areas of the reflective surfaces. In the case of my new little New York bedroom, literally every surface in the room is reflective, making for a pretty poor listening room without extensive treatments. So in addition to putting up pictures and getting myself a proper desk upon which to set up the stereo I plan to build, I also purchased a few 2'x4' pieces of sound dampening foam. This stuff is actually quite difficult to put anywhere if you want to be able to remove it later. I tried nails, which just take out tiny pieces from the back and the rest of the mat falls off the wall. I tried those removable 3M strips, which have nowhere near enough contact surface area on the foam for a bond to form, and a few other thought experiments that probably wouldn't have worked. What did work is a spray-on, foaming adhesive: http://www.auralex.com/acoustic_adhesive_foamtak/acoustic_adhesive_foamtak.asp I have no doubt that I'm going to have to sand and repaint the sections of drywall i'm putting this stuff on, but it sure does hold the foam on the wall.  
  
One thing about the new apartment is that A - I can't turn the (free) heat off and B - there is a lot of road noise from the street below. Because of (A) I have to keep my window open at night or I wake up in an oven, and because of (B) it's annoying to listen to music with the window open. So I thought it'd be a good idea to apply some of my fancy sound absorbing foam to the ceiling above my window; figured if I could catch the 'first reflection' of the street noise off my ceiling, I could make my room a little quieter and leave the window open. It's had some good effect so far but that's another story. Anyway, being the resourceful fella I am, I applied the spray on stuff to the back of the foam panel, put a stepladder on top of a coffee table (my brilliance begins to show) and carefully stuck the panel to the ceiling. Job well done.  
  
Right up until this morning, when I wake up and see that half of the foam panel has come unstuck.  
  
This is where it gets good. Because now, having successfully applied the spray on foam to 3 other wall panels, I am an Expert Spray-On Adhesive User. By the by, this stuff is one of those products that's got some pretty exotic chemicals in it, and it says right there in big letters WARNING: USE ONLY IN WELL-VENTILATED AREAS and WASH IMMEDIATELY UPON CONTACT WITH SKIN. But whatever, I know what I'm doing. It's 7am and I just got 3 hours of sleep, all I want to do is spray the ceiling and re-stick my panel so it doesn't fall off today. So I grab the can, hold back the foam, and spray away, completely forgetting that maybe there's a good reason it says to be 3-5 inches away from the surface you're spraying (I'm like 18"" away) and also apparently forgetting about gravity and how the surface tension OF AN AIRBORNE ADHESIVE might work.  
  
As expected, the foam shoots out, doesn't make it, forms a thick bubbly rope of scary ass superglue above my stupid head, and, like a bad porno movie, falls directly onto me. And me, being the Max Level Genius I am, am not wearing a shirt. Still have that image of shirtless Selleck in your head? Good.  
  
So the first reaction in these sorts of situations is instinctive - Get This Crap Off, ASAP. So in a typical MENSA-like calm, I walk over, grab a paper towel, and try to grab/wipe this stuff off, because it isn't actually in contact with my skin yet. Ever accidentally get gum in your hair and grab it too fast so it spreads to other hair? Or smoosh a piece of duct tape to your arm by accident? So this is kinda like that. Only it is uber-tacky-mega-glue that's already been drying for 20 seconds, so of course spreading it out instantly dries it. Which isn't the most comfortable thing in the world. So now, slightly high from the fumes of the adhesive, I read the label: WASH IMMEDIATELY WITH SOAP AND WATER. Sure, okay, to the shower! I was headed there anyway. I got this.  
  
Nope. That crap dries fast and is incredibly not water soluble. Reaction no.2 is ""okay, what gets rid of exotic glue?"" Goo Gone, of course! Don't have any. To the local hardware store! Good thing there's one literally across the street. $4.30 and a hurridly written and fairly cryptic email to my employer later and I'm back in the shower. Of course, I got the liquid stuff, not the citrus-based gel, which the store was out of. Yes, it's the little yellow bottle of organic chemical stuff that says WARNING USE IN WELL VENTILATED AREA MAY CAUSE HEADACHES. EYE IRRITANT. SKIN IRRITANT. But whatever, I'd rather have an itchy rash for a day than a bulletproof mat of hair glued to my manboob which makes it diffuclt to raise my arms for the next four weeks. 
  
But what follows is truly spectacular. Because whatever this adhesive is and whatever this flavor of Goo Gone is, they don't work as advertised on man hair. In fact, the goo gone serves to dilute the adhesive just enough to spread it around, but not remove it. And thus, instantly-superglued chest hair coverage has increased by a factor of 3 while I'm standing in the shower. Fuck.  
  
At this point, panic has started to seep in around the corners of my supervillian-genius-like calm, and now i'm high from the dual fumes of the adhesive spray and the whacky unpronounceables they put in Goo Gone, and trying to operate my laptop with fingers covered in fuzz from my towel, because the adhesive has now spread to my hands and become tacky everywhere and I had to dry off somehow. C'mon, google, don't let me down... Rubbing alcohol and/or nail polish! Acetone! To the hardware store v2.0! 10 minutes and $3.00 later and i'm in the shower again getting a nose full of acetone-based nail polish remover.  
  
Weeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaand it doesn't work.  
  
So now I'm a little high, late for work, a little pissed but also laughing uncontrolably at myself, with two hands that look like I've worked in a blue towel factory since I was 10 and with a massive, manly chestful of hair firmly glued onto my skin and slowly drying. Feels a bit like a bad sunburn, especially since the Goo Gone made me itch. Pro Tip: Read labels and warnings and removal instructions BEFORE you start using products that could end up on your skin. Or maybe wear a shirt when dealing with extremely flammable, toxic chemicals.  
  
Thankfully in my impaired state - the acetone isn't doing me any favors - I finally manage to recall specifically asking the guy who sold me the adhesive what would get it off. He had said something about citrus-based cleaners. Well, worth a shot - and hey! Turns out I have some environmentally-sensitive and horribly overpriced lemon-based dish soap under the kitchen counter, because I care about the environment. To the shower v3.0! And dish soap made from fruit is the crap that ends up working. Mostly. A few good chunks had to be ripped out, bikini-wax style, but a nice long agonizing chest rub full of dish soap ends up saving most of my skin. And man-rug. But not what they call in the matrix my residual self-image.  
  
TL;DR A shirtless sleep-deprived moron superglues his chest hair while standing on a stepladder on top of a coffee table in front of an open 4th story window, shenanigans ensue.

There is an unbelievable amount of information out there on the topic, and as much opinion as well. Below is the simplest start to understanding how and where to start as a budding audiophile. 

**Part 1: Digital Media**
Source players: iPhone, iPod, iPad, Zune, Android device, Mac, PC, etc. 

First, if you have a significant amount of audio, or plan on collecting a significant amount, consider using your PC or Mac as your main source (but know that your computer will have to be on every time you want to listen to something). 

[This   post is a good place to start](http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/v6pix/apple_users_are_audiophiles_too_and_we_care_a_lot/)
With some advice from /u/Uncle_Erik
&gt;Don't get hung up on portable sources and using an iPad. First, the iPad doesn't have anywhere enough storage to hold a bunch of lossless albums.
What you want to do is run your Mac, AirPort or AppleTV into a DAC connected to your system. 

Or, if you don’t have a Mac, then your PC. The idea is to store lossless albums in a device that has a lot of cheap storage. Lossless albums take up space. 

* In what format do I want my audio?

From /u/Uncle_Erik 

&gt;Don't bother with AAC in any form. Use ALAC, FLAC or 24/96 files. Storage is so cheap that there's no excuse for lossy codecs.

Counterpoint to Uncle_Erik's comment from /u/Aver

&gt;This is very subjective. Many people, hardcore audiophiles included will not hear a difference between lossless and other formats.
Also, technically, AAC has a fair set of advantages over MP3, and becomes transparent at lower bitrates than MP3, and in that respect, Opus is actually superior to either, but suffers from a resampler that is sometimes audibly different (Opus converts everything to 48 Khz on encoding)

**Part 1a: How do I get my audio from my PC, Mac, iPod, iPhone, Android, etc to my power source (receiver, amplifier)?** 

* Streaming Devices:

The digital information that is your music can be sent wirelessly to a device, the device’s DAC converts the data to analog, the receiver/amplifier “amplifies” the sound and sends it to your speakers. 

From Uncle_Erik

&gt;An AppleTV or Airport Express both have optical audio out and will give you bit-perfect optical out. That’s as good as it gets. 

From /u/Arve

&gt;in audiophilia this is much preferred, as the vast majority of source material will be 44/16 

The optical audio out is sent through the 3.5mm jack - you’ll need an adaptor [like this](http://www.amazon.com/eForCity-Digital-Optical-Audio-TosLink/dp/B001ZU3G2I/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360953300&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=apple+tv+optical+audio+cable) to connect to 3.5mm to digital optical cable. 

The advice above references Apple products in response to question about Apple products, but the ideas are the same. 

Here are some other devices to stream audio from your PC, Mac to your power source:

[Sonos](http://www.sonos.com/)

[Logitech Squeezebox Touch](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-930-000090-Squeezebox-Touch/dp/B002LARRDA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344571403&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=logitech+squeezebox)

* Line Out

Or, if you don’t want to use a streaming device or a seperate DAC you can use a line out cable [like this one](http://www.amazon.com/Ziotek-ZT1900665HC1-3-Feet-30Pin-Stereo/dp/B0051MQJ7A/ref=sr_1_10?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344574032&amp;sr=1-10&amp;keywords=line+out+to+rca) for iPhone, iPad, or iPod. 

The idea is to bypass the DAC of the portable device because typically they aren’t well made and audio quality will suffer. 

**Part 1b: Digital to Analog Converters (DACs)**

You've got your storage device, you've got your digital source material, now how do you get it to your speakers with the least amount of interference? This is where DACs come in to play. 


Receivers and the iPhone, iPod, iPad, Zune, Mac, and PC all have Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) chips that convert your music from digital bits to an analog signal so you can hear it. This built-in DAC is okay, but it is better to use a separate DAC component (like an Airport Express) or the DAC on your receiver as they are usually a better quality. (I think I copy/pasted this from someone else’s comment or post, but I can’t find the source. If it’s yours please let me know so I can source it)

Quality varies in DAC chips and it is better to use one that is designed for high end audio. Some DACs are portable (for headphones), some are designed to be used at home within a system. (I think I copy/pasted this from someone else’s comment or post, but I can’t find the source. If it’s yours please let me know so I can source it)

For more in-depth explanation on DACs, read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/15wunp/guide_dacs_and_amps/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/14pxwp/why_dac_and_amplifier/c7fjifx)

DACs can be used two ways depending on the setup you want. If you are using headphones, you can use a DAC and a headphone amp. If you have a home audio setup, you can use a DAC and then a receiver or an amplifier. 

Here are some often recommended budget DACs

* Budget:
[Behringer UCA202](http://www.amazon.com/Behringer-UCA202-Audio-Interface/dp/B000KW2YEI/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360954560&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=behringer+uca202)
from /u/Aver
&gt;While it's probably a fine DAC if you have onboard audio or a bad laptop, this recommendation comes with reservations - the UCA-202 is worse than the typical output on any Mac (And I'm pretty sure it applies to other computers as well, but macs are what I know)

* Entry Level:
[ODAC](http://www.jdslabs.com/item.php?fetchitem=46)  and Focusrite 2i2/2i4/8i6 (link anyone?)
&gt;This is a fine DAC, but I'm also placing one reservation against it - I'm connecting mine through a USB hub, and I routinely need to disconnect it because it fails to sync properly, causing noise on the output. In addition to the ones you suggested, I'd also like to add the Focusrite 2i2/2i4/8i6 - yes, they are audio interfaces aimed at musicians, but the DAC is on-par with the O2, but offers a very handy feature for anyone connecting to studio monitors or power amps: Volume control. (The 2i2 can be found for $109 through Google shopping)

* DACS and sound cards
*Need additional input/research*


**Part 2: CD Players**

*Need additional input/research*

**Part 3: Vinyl**

Check out /r/vinyl and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/fiedy/my_attempt_at_creating_a_guide_to_vinyl_to_answer/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/xs9yh/baller_on_a_budget_the_cheap_setup_thread/) guide. 

**Part 4: Receivers and Amplifiers**

There are two ways to power the audio that is sent to your speakers. A receiver is the simplest and probably the most affordable method. The receiver typically has a tuner, a DAC, a preamp, and an amplifier. 

It is important to note if you plan on buying a turntable, you need a receiver that has a phonostage. A phonostage is sometimes built into a receiver, inputs labeled “phono”, or can be purchased as a separate piece of equipment. 

Simply put, a preamp prepares the signal (the audio) for amplification. A receiver has a preamp built into it as well as a DAC and can be considered an all-in-one device. For those starting out in audio, or on a tight budget, a receiver is a good place to start. 

As with the DAC, separating the components can allow for higher quality products at each stage. Again, the idea is to get the source material to the speakers with as little interference as possible. Poor quality products “interfere” with the audio source and alter the quality before it gets to the speakers. 

A preamp and amplifier are often used for higher-end setups. A dedicated preamp allows you to select the audio source (digital, phono, cd player) and prepares that source material to be amplified by a separate amplifier. 

The amplifier takes the source provided by the preamp, “amplifies” it, and sends the amplified sound to the speakers. 

If you’re starting out on a tight budget, start with a receiver as opposed to a preamp and amplifier. A modern receiver will power the speakers with relatively little interference. Even receivers designed for home theater (5.1, 7.1) will be okay to power 2 speakers to get you started. Do some research on brands, and try to buy used to save money. 

* On using home cinema receivers:

From /u/Arve
&gt;All modern home cinema receivers are fully capable of outputting a 2.0 signal to just the front speakers. However, many of them aren't capable of doing so as well as a similarly priced dedicated 2.0 amp.

and

&gt;But, to clarify, you are probably associating ""receiver"" with a home cinema receiver, which is a device which typically has five power amplifiers, one for each of the channels in a surround set up, and either a line out for a subwoofer, or a separate power amplifier for the sub. In addition, the home cinema receiver has the radio, as I established by the term ""receiver"", in addition to a set of HDMI inputs and outputs to deal with the picture, plus analog video inputs/outputs.
Which brings me to why I say ""stay with stereo"". All of these components cost money to make, and especially in the case of power amplification, can't really be built cheaply. The capacitors, inductors and transformers involved in the power amplification stage is expensive to make. If you want to make it cheap, you end up with an amplifier that's starved for power and finesse.
Also, while the receiver doesn't really cost all that much to make these days (it's quite probably just an extra chip with a tiny bit of electronics around, and some control circuitry), it's not something you need if you just want to amplify sound from a computer source or gaming console, I'd say ""stick with an integrated amp"", just make sure that it has enough analog inputs to handle the equipment you're hooking up to it: One input from your TV, one from your computer


* If you have some money to shop around for a used 2.0 receiver:

From /u/Uncle_Erik

&gt;First, go with a good brand. Ones I like include NAD, Rotel, Adcom, and Marantz. Do not be afraid of used/vintage ones. These can hold up for years and are worth repairing. You can find a lot of them at Audiogon and sometimes they turn up on Craigslist.

* How much power do you need? 

From /u/Uncle_Erik

&gt;Anything that puts out 20W or better should be fine. This isn't the time to get into how much power the typical speaker uses, but it is a LOT less than most people think. Even 5W or less can drive most speakers well.

Then, when you play back both tracks simultaneously, the wave forms collapse except where there is ""missing"" audio in the lossy track. Voila, now you know what you are missing.

Black_Xero	211	24	121	"So a few weeks ago I posted pictures of [this monster amplifier](http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/1dir32/so_this_monster_just_arrived_via_freight_truck/) that my friend purchased for his stereo/home theater setup when we became a dealer for Earthquake.  It delivers 328 watts into an 8 ohm load with all 7 channels driven.  Everyone wanted to know what it would be powering.  The speakers were delivered at the end of last week to his place.

[Here are the pictures.](http://imgur.com/a/I2frf)  Please forgive the crappy cell phone shots.  I never claimed to be a photographer.

The speakers are made by Earthquake Sound.  Earthquake is well known for their insane home theater subwoofers and mobile audio products.  A few years back they made an entry into the high-end speaker market with their $29,000 flagship Titan Tethys (pronounced teeth-us) tower speakers.  Just for good measure, they decided to build a $7,500 center channel called the Rhea (pronounced ree-uh).  If you look around there is almost NOTHING written about these speakers, which is a crying shame because they are actually pretty amazing.  The Tethys weigh in at almost 400 lbs gross weight per side and measure 5'x2'x1.5'. The Rhea is about 250 lbs and 3 feet wide.  To say that these speakers are large is an understatement.  

The finish on the lower part of the Tethys is actually 16 layers of steam-bent cherry wood.  The 10 layers of piano black lacquer on the speakers is polished to a mirror finish.  I've heard that paint process takes almost a whole month to complete.  The binding posts on the rear of the speakers are HUGE, accepting up to 4-gauge wire!  The Rhea can be bi-amped and the Tethys can be quad-amped.  The Tethys consists of a 1.5"" silk dome tweeter, 5.25"" carbon kevlar mid range, 8"" mid bass, two 12"" bass drivers made of silk-laminated pressed-pulp, and a 15"" passive radiator to finish it off.  The Rhea contains three 1.5"" silk dome tweeters and four 6.5"" silk-laminated pressed-pulp mid-range drivers.  Earthquake claims that the Tethys will drive all the way down to 17 hz.

[Here is the manual for the speakers.](http://www.earthquakesound.com/IMAGEJP/HOME/PDF/Titan-Manual.pdf)

Just to round the system out, my friend also purchased a pair of Earthquake's $9,500 Titan Tigris speakers that are currently performing the duty of the rear channels in his 5.1 setup.  Unfortunately, he is currently living in a mid-sized apartment.  All of these monster speakers are in his small living room, so it less than ideal for critical listening.  However, he is currently in the market for a home with a proper listening room.  These speakers will see about 50/50 between music and movies, as my friend is big home theater guy.  His DVD and Bluray collection numbers in the thousands. 

I don't have much listening time in on these speakers yet, but I am very impressed by what I've heard so far.  These behemoths practically disappeared during She &amp; Him's version of ""I put a spell on you"".  We also played the opening scene to Quantum of Solace and the result was honestly better than anything I have ever experienced in a theater.  I was blown away.  I'm hoping to conduct a proper listening test with the help of u/strategicdeceiver.  Stay tuned.

I hope I covered everything.  I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my knowledge."	t5_2qmiy	True

I am not talking any a tiny flaws either. Somewhere in the recent months Parts Express seems to have contracted another manufacturer to build the B652's (probably to better keep up with demand) and in doing so this new manufacturer has learned to redefine the term *We Screwed the Pooch*. I personally bought eight pair of these new 652's. Four in Nov12 and four in Dec12 and left them in my closet (rainy day supply).. My friend in CT also had two new sets from DEC12 and neither one of us took them out of the box to check until this week. His experiences were similar to mine but less dramatic.

Linked below is a recording I have made using a TASCAM DR-40 stereo recorder into a 16 bit WAV while setup on a tripod approximately three feet from two pairs of speakers (one old, one new). The speakers were stacked one on top of the other with the bottom pair upside down at the very edge of a table. This guarantees all the driver are the same distance away from the recorder and none of the *issues* you are hearing are due to any positional differences.

..... Have you listened? ......

I spent a good deal of time going over the Old Vs New trying to figure out what in the world could cause this catastrophic change and they pretty much changed everything on these speakers since the last revision. EVERYTHING..

[Quick dirty video overview of the visible changes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-XySNgnnQw&amp;hd=1)

The boxes are now slightly (~1/16th) bigger in all dimensions, The finish is shinier, The screws went from phillips head to hex. There is a flat spot on the tweeters center dome. Speaker grills are bigger and have a different peg system. The foam around the woofer is now in segments instead of one piece. The hanger clip is oval and horizontal instead of vertical and square. They added foam feet. The rear spring clips are far more crappy.

On the insides the changes aren't any harder to see. The amount of polyfill is about half what it was and the tweeter's capacitor is now 3.3uf 50v versus 3.3uf 100V. The woofer's structure is slightly different with no holes around the suspension metal and a much shinier paint job. The wiring changed too. Instead of parallel from the rear clips to each speaker (cap on terminals) they run the drivers piggy back with the cap on the tweeter and everything is now soldiered instead of using connectors. 

 I did some direct power experimentation wiring the old and new drivers directly to my amplifier and simply trying to pick out what was different via a mono source. The woofer was a very subtle sound signature change. A bit harsher then the old unit. Really just too small of a change to really describe. The tweeter on the other hand was about 40% louder than the old one when wired to a full range signal. Possibly why they used a different capacitor. Putting the old drivers and cap in the new box seemed fine so don't blame that. This is a QC failure, plain and simple.

I have removed the links to the daytons from my lists on my subreddit and WILL contact Dayton directly and try to figure out if they even acknowledge this horrible change. I was hoping there would be an easy fix for this but that seems less and less likely.

I have dedicated a good portion of my time pushing these speakers because the originals were worth pushing. I will get to the root of this and see if any fixes can be offered. Sorry if this is posted too late for some. Maybe there are good units out there but I don't think I have any.

Contained within this RAR'd and Zipped archive(for security) are five roughly four minute songs all sourced from verified lossless FLAC. All were chosen for their consistency of tempo and four for the quality of their recordings. The last song was chosen because it is a wonderful example of horrific recording quality, each from a different genre.
___
* **What did you do to them?**
___


I took these five songs, converted them to 16bit, 44100 WAV and used Audacity to split them into 1 minute sections. Three of these sections were then re-encoded from that lossless WAV to MP3-320 Joint Stereo, AAC-192 and MP3-128 Non-joint Stereo (via Goldwave) while the last section remains lossless. The three now compressed parts were again decompressed to WAV and reassembled in Audacity in the correct playback order with the various compressions randomized for YOU (not me). I tried to remove any clicks and pops between sections but some do remain but shouldn't affect the tests.
___
* **What do you want me to do?**
___


Play the songs back however you like via headphones, speakers, winamp, foobar etc. DO NOT RE-ENCODE FOR iTUNES!! and with [THIS ONLINE FORM](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1p4d1mbQqNb2uYi-Rz_m4RWRg1OMUvepLSzT5Et6MNro/viewform) fill in 1 thru 4 of what quality you believe each 1 minute section of song represents. 1 being the best, 4 the worst on a scale. Do not pick BEST, WORST or the in-betweens for more then ONE section per song. 

After you have played back all Five songs and filled in your OPINIONS as to what sounds Worst, Good, Better, BEST.. You will be asked for *A* name (anything you want), you must check Speakers or Headphones (or both) as the device used for playback and finally there is an area for a short one line description of your test setup IE:: *1999 Altec Lansing PC speakers* or *Sennheiser HD800's, blessed by VooDoo priests and filled with Magic rocks!*.

___
The results will not be posted until at least 100 people have taken the test. (maybe more depending on how long that takes). Feel free to re-link this post or the form  to ANYONE you think might want to participate.


**MAKE SURE YOU VOTE 1 FOR THE BEST SOUNDING AND 4 FOR THE WORST** My hopes being not this many people like 128mp3 and are just doin' it wrong.

1357322935.0	15ylpx	iTunes 11.0.1 Audio Quality Null Test	thescort	126	13	66	"There has been a lot of chatter on various Apple and Audio forums about the sound quality of iTunes (version 11 and in general)
I figured I'd do some null tests.   
  
here is how I went about it:  
Took a .wav file (Bounced from a multitrack at 24bit/44.1kHz) and loaded into my DAW   
Took the same .wav file and loaded it into iTunes (without converting) (24bit/44.1kHz still, of course) NOTE: I directed iTunes to read the EXACT SAME FILE as the DAW, these are not two copies of the same file, it is two programs referring to the SAME copy.  
  
Using soundflower, I fed the iTunes output to my DAW and recorded about 60s of iTunes playback.   

**Hypothesis:** There is a difference between the original file, and iTunes output   
  
**Null Hypothesis:** There is no difference between iTunes output and the original file. 

In order to accept our hypothesis, the resulting file should not be silence, there should be at least some deviation of the waveform from 0db. 

**The result:** *We must reject the hypothesis in favour of the null.* The resulting file was silence. There was no audible or visible audio when the iTunes playback and the original file were combined with inverted phase. This suggests that iTunes was perfectly reproducing the test file. 

[Tracks from top to bottom: Captured iTunes playback; Original wavefile; sum of (inverted) iTunes and Original. ](http://i.imgur.com/cLAlJ)  
   
  
  

[A close up of the Null file with dB scale to left. ](http://i.imgur.com/lhc6R)  
  
Note that at full zoom there is no deviation from the 0 crossing. Looking at the scale to the left we can see that the entire scale represents &lt;1dB so that means if there is any deviation from 0, it deviates by less than a fraction of a dB.   

  

What do we take away from this? The playback from iTunes is exactly the same as the original file being played back."	t5_2qmiy	True

1364484932.0	1b6jnm	Have you met any audiophiles crazies ?  Here's my story...	mapin	125	17	160	"He swore by painting the top of all his cds with green paint to ""avoid laser dispersion through the disc"", and shaving the outer edge of his cds to ""make certain they are perfect circles for balance"".  Totally convinced these rituals he claims to have discovered made an audible difference. 

Worst part was he was a salesperson at a high end audio shop. 

He refused to play lossless music from the source I brought with me (iPod classic) when I wanted to audition equipment, and instead insisted I listen to his green and shaved cds that he mixed himself.  He also argued that cables (including the power cords) are as important to the sound as the other hardware.  

Tried to sell me on his service of having him come to my home to ""optimize"" my setup with his golden ears. 

When he hit ""play"" on a CD track, he would immediately hit ""back"" to start the track over to ""reset the clocks and reduce jitter"".

He claimed that ""even his wife"" could hear the difference when he switched cables or when he painted a CD. He played a painted CD in the car (!!) for her and she ""noticed the difference immediately"".

Needless to say, I won't be going back there and I'm inclined to disclose the store name here to warn others (should I?).

Remembered another one: I tried to point out the law of diminishing returns with audio gear (i.e. at a certain point you end up paying exuberant amounts of money for fractions of a percent of increase in fidelity).  Nope, he doesn't like to ""talk in percentages because it's about the whole experience that will bring tears to your eyes and you can't put a price on that"".

Edit: Removed store information at Mods request to avoid problems.

Totally reminded me of this fictional story about audiophiles (very funny if you have 30 min to spare):

I'm personally coming to visit this community less and less because of this; any interest in a ""budget audio"" Subreddit? 

**EDIT:** 

Reviewing the comments so far, the majority are against the idea, but not by much. The main argument against is that people won't use the new subreddit, or just keep posting here, as they are more likely to get advice more quickly. I feel that's flawed thinking, as it would be true with any new community; it will take time and work to support a new budget audio subreddit, and until a sufficient effort has been made to test it's usefulness, mere speculation does next to nothing. 

Other arguments against that I think are valid are the ambiguity of ""budget"", wanting to get the ""most expert"" (we try our best, right?) help possible, which would not work well in a community of mostly new audio enthusiasts, and being able to encourage people with small budgets to possibly increase their budgets, or seek out different/higher-end gear. 

We couldn't force people with more experience to advise at a budget audio subreddit, and because everyone is already here, I'm starting to think it is a poor idea. 

Perhaps instead, encouraging subscribers to do more of their own research, demoing, reading, and consulting with local shops (if possible) could help reduce these posts. I want to help foster a positive community here, where at least not *all* of the posts are: ""Need surround system for dorm parties, LOUD, $50 MAX, can you help?"", or ""is this very easily googled brand, which has a cheap build quality, and costs very little, a good audiophile purchase?""

That just about sums up this place. I know theres not much more to cover, but in all honesty you all know the brands that are good. You know what you should be buying. But for some reason those 250 reviews --professional and consumer-- aren't enough. So lets bring it to /r/audiophile and have them tell me exactly what every other internet resource is telling me too. 

There are *more* than helpful sidebar links, and scrolling literally one or two pages could probably contain your question. ""What media player do you use???"" 

I'm really a fan of the discussion posts when they come up once or twice in a blue moon. Deals are sweet too. But I can only take enough recommendations for budget set ups. 

Also did I mention iTunes is literally hitler? And the Pioneer/Dayton bookshelves are gems. 

I'm not trying to be condescending towards the budget audiophiles either, this goes with saying for everybody: **Go to your local hi-fi, Best Buy Magnolia, etc. and listen for yourself** Klipsch speakers are bright, Monitor Audios are warm, and B&amp;Ws sound dead accurate but lifeless. Those terms are entirely subjective and mean nothing over the internet in text so why bother?

I don't even care about the picture albums. They're fun to look at. But the word humble now applies to anything from $10-$5,000 so have at it.

And, uncharacteristically for /r/audiophile, I just want something that's good music, and _I don't care about the fidelity_, or whether it's Tuvan throat singing, Polish Jazz, EDM or Brazilian Polka. I just crave new music.

Throw your best albums at me, from a _musical_ standpoint.

**Edit:** Keep it coming. I've discovered a lot of stuff that goes straight into my playlists, some stuff I want to explore deeper, and some stuff I am completely head over heels in love with.  And I have a playlist I won't get through in weeks, and I have found inspiration for the stuff I am working on as well.  This is probably the /r/audiophile music thread I've seen with the most interesting _music_ I've seen in the last year, and I'm handing out upvotes like candy.

1372218391.0	1h33pv	The moment the speakers disappeared...	pearljamman010	96	10	28	"So I got bored of all my usual music since I drive 3 hours a day to work and wore a lot of it out.  Lately, I have been listening to melodic / progressive metal and progressive rock (Disarmonia Mundi, Mastodon, Ne Obliviscaris, Beardfish, Thank You Scientist, old Journey (pre Steve Perry) etc).  I got bored and created a Imogen Heap Pandora station and have really grown to like her solo stuff, along with her group Frou Frou and also Florence + Machine.  I got home and purchased an Imogen Heap album and the Frou Frou album.  I haven't had music make me feel this way since I used to use some cannabis and a certain fungus.

My decent setup:

* Carver PM-600 (300 watts x 2 4Ω) amp
* David Hafler DH-110 preamp
* Martin Logan Motion 12 (each 300 watts RMS 4Ω)

I played an old standard (Norah Jones - Nightingale) and arranged my speakers to find the sweet spot.  I found that putting the preamp in Mono mode helped find the center.  The sweet spot was ~2 feet out from the wall, 6 feet apart from each other, and about 6 feet from my listening position with ears at the tweeter and mid range.  The speakers were toed in about 15 degrees towards me.

I started with Frou Frou's ""Details"" album and immediately was smiling with the opening track ""Let Go"".  The intro riff bothered me because I knew I had heard it before (turns out Wiz Khalifa sampled it on one of his mix tapes on the song ""In The Cut"").  The electronic beats and acoustic music, combined with her raspy, silky smooth voice that takes over some of the melodic duties was fantastic.  The next song that got me excited was ""Must Be Dreaming"".  I usually take a few minutes to *sink in* to my listening position and let the physical start to melt to the floor.  I turned the volume up to about 150 watts and the speakers start to really shine.  The best part about the Motion 12's are either the semi-dipole mid range (open back with honeycomb screen and black cloth cover) or the folded ribbon tweeter.  From my spot, her voice projected itself right dead center between the speakers and the reverb made the music pulse in a 3 dimensional field.  The bass is a bit week, so I turned it up (100 hz) about 3-4 dB since I removed the wall reinforcement.  Then I played Psychobabble and the immersion was complete.  The song starts with a hang drum and you can hear and feel the impact of the mallet.  If I didn't know better, I thought I was tripping.  The mixing is INCREDIBLE on this album.  The strings kick in (bass, cello, violins etc) and I could pin point the location of each according to the mix.  By this point, I had a shit eating grin on my face.

Next, I played her solo album ""i-Megaphone"".  The first few songs were a bit lackluster but her vocals really really shine.  I think her voice is perfect to test if your midrange and highs are too bright or dull.  Luckily, I didn't feel the need to adjust these as my preamp only has bass and treble controls.  By the time I got to ""Rake It In"" I got the feeling back that I was in the studio.  The haunting piano and her voice sucked me in and I was surrounded with the music.  There are some digital bass lines, as well as what sounds like a cello that the 2 x 6.5"" woofers handled nicely.  Then there is some odd cymbals and creaking sounds that pan back in forth in the middle of the room that completely throw you off your balance.

My **holy shit** moment was when I switched to the ""Speak For Yourself"" album.  The first song ""Headlock"" is so smooth and catchy that a pair of crappy earbuds will make you miss the music.  The intro has some digital percussive instruments that sound similar to a xylophone and had me tapping my foot.  Her voice again, is so graceful and powerful that it rivals or bests Adele's.  The dynamics of this song really shine with the percussion and bass line.  Also is her probably best known song, ""Hide And Seek"".  This song is pure harmony enhanced with a vocoder that adds many 3D layers and is a ride for sure.  (This is the song that that d-bag sampled from where she goes ""Whatcha say.. Ooooh what would you say?"")

The moment that the speakers and everything else completely left the room and I experienced pseudo synesthesia was during the song ""Have You Got It In You"".  The synth rhythm line and her voice put me in a trance.  Then some ambiance, a harp and a triangle start to build and my heart starts beating a bit quicker.  The drums kick in and a strong cello line comes in to augment the low end and her harmony becomes part of the instrumentation.  About this point, eyes closed and body completely sunk into the love seat, I can see the width, height and depth of the music.  The tweeters are silky smooth, every triangle and breath comes off the top without a hint of sibilance.  The mid ranges project just enough sound out the back and sides that it creates a virtual surround setup without much cancellation to distract.  The woofers kept up, but material below 50 hz was a bit lacking.  If I could get that bottom octave and some sound dampening, I would never have the urge to upgrade.  I was floored that being 100% sober, I could feel music like this.

**TL;DR**: Get your hands on some lossless versions of Imogen Heaps music to test your system.  Take a few minutes to get your setup in the right position and find a sweet spot (the Motions have a fairly narrow one, but once you find it, it's grins from ear to ear).  Don't worry that someone else out there has something that costs 20x your setup, it's about loving the music.  I consider myself a rocker, but for enjoying the time and effort that goes into composing, recording, and mixing a great record, this stuff works way better.

Unlike their earlier work, it is mostly normal instruments played by first class session musicians. The production quality is exceptional - no dynamic compression here. The percussion is exceptional. This album has some of the most intricate drum work I have heard. The 5 string bass also brings deep organic rumble to the recording. They spent a million dollars on the orchestra. One of the vocalists remarked that the microphone he was using was worth more than his (rather nice) car.   
The album has remarkable variety, but my favorite is track 3. Whatever a stereo might have to do - it will have to do it all when playing that song. It was specifically made as a showcase for all the different styles of popular music. "	t5_2qmiy	True

For people who like graphs.. (and who doesn't) **[Here is the compiled data](http://imgur.com/a/lHnP3)** .. Big ups to /u/theyield for putting these together for us.

These show that in 3 out of the 5 songs FLAC is indeed chosen as the best sounding section. 320 MP3 was chosen best in 2 of the 5 songs and AAC192 somehow barely holds its own against 128 MP3.

The big surprise came with the composition of the overall graph at the bottom that summarized all the results from all the songs and shows exactly as intended that Flac is #1, MP3 320 is #2, AAC192 is #3 and MP3 128 is #4. So yes, WE as a people with varying setups and players CAN indeed tell flac from MP3-320, aac192 and MP3-128.

_____
**If you can you give me some more specifics on when these faulty units were sold I can relay them to the community's I frequent . I want to make sure people with perfectly fine speakers don't start asking for refunds and give them a specific date range.**

*Not all of the ""new design"" units are experiencing the low tweeter output issue. There is no specific date range that can be given.  We know that units with the low output tweeter existed in the last arrival in 2012, but because of the spotty nature of the problem not all of these units on that shipment are experiencing the low tweeter output issue. Due to this fact the only way to address this problem with your customers is to tell them that if they recently purchased a set of B652's and they have issues with the sound quality to contact Parts Express. We will take care of them.*
_____

**How/when would you like me to tell the people who also purchased these speakers that you are willing to do this exchange/refund? I don't think handing every single one of them your personal email would be an effective system ;)  and I want to give at least a rough date estimate as to when then can expect the quality to be back to expected levels.**

*Currently we are out of stock of the B652, but they will be back in stock in a few weeks with full QC and specifically on the high end issue.  If the customer is unhappy with the sound quality of their set we will replace them with a set out of the new inventory at no charge (as stock arrives), for those that do not want a replacement set we will offer a full refund to those who fall within 45 days of purchase.  We will always work to make our customers happy and if there is a case that falls outside these guidelines we can work with the customer to have full satisfaction.*

_____

So that is all for now. If you purchased the B652's at parts express or on amazon contact parts express and they will replace or refund if you received any of the faulty batches. My advice is ignore the 45 day return window and contact them anyway. Their Customer service is one of the reasons I recommend them so much in the first place.

I will be receiving one of the first pairs of ""fixed""/"" Actual Quality Controlled"" B652's for evaluation and will obviously report back here with my findings. Being a few weeks away from that I recommend anyone who thinks they got a faulty set (and you will know it) contact PE and setup your exchange/replace now. "	t5_2qmiy	True

1341785115.0	w8lnd	When it comes to sound quality, maybe we aren't looking in the right place	Milsivich	89	11	34	"I want to talk about something that's been troubling me recently about the focus of audiophile communities, but first let me quickly introduce myself. I am a Physics / Music Composition double major in college, and in both majors I do a lot of acoustics. It's interesting because a musician's idea of what's important in acoustics is very different than a physicists idea. I've actually published work in the physical acoustics of wind instruments, so I've spent some time with the numbers/graphs as well as the qualitative listening skills I have learned earning my Bachelor of Music degree.

I have always been picky about sound, though it started out about things like piano tunings and hammer noises, etc... Recently I have started paying a lot more attention to sound REproduction. I built myself a new sound system, and I started dabbling with various mediums, including vinyl and all the various digital formats from the crappiest mp3s to pure WAV files. Before I go on, let me show what I've been listening on:

Polk LSi9's
Parasound Newclassic 2100 and 2125 preamp/amp
MicroPRO 3000
MRT Music Streamer II

It's kind of a ""budget"" audiophile system, but I really enjoy it. I'm starting to think we aren't paying attention to the right details when it comes to trying to get the best listening experience. First let me talk about sound quality of digital mediums. For me, I can instantly tell if a recording is 128 kbps or lower. It still bothers me a lot up to ~180-200 kbps. I'm happy with ~280 kbps, and anything past that I honestly can't tell the difference from a CD.

I feel like to be an ""audiophile"" is to pay incredible attention to these kinds of numbers, and to bothered by the product of the sound if they are too low; if you are listening to a lossy format, you aren't doing it right; if you use your computer's stock on-board DAC, you aren't doing it right; if you don't buy the best cables, you aren't doing it right. Details like this DO make a difference physically, and I've seen the graphs that show it. I'm not saying there aren't people out there who are genuinely bothered by sound quality defects caused by some of these things. I know lots of people who can't tell the difference between a CD and a 64 kbps mp3, and I know some people who claim they can tell the difference between 320 kbps formats and CD quality formats; we are all somewhere on a hearing scale, and it's all about finding something you are happy with.

But here is the deal. I have been a lurking member of the ""audiophile"" community for a few years now (not just on reddit), and there are things that make a HUGE difference in sound that people talk about very rarely, if at all. There are a lot of factors in what makes a listening experience good or not, but here are two factors that I would like to see people paying more attention to:

1) Room acoustics. In my slightly profession--and certainly my personal--opinion, this determines the audio quality that reaches your ears far more than the medium you are choosing to listen to (given that it isn't something dumb like 64 kbps mp3). The type of carpet, the shape of the room (including height), the TYPE of ceiling, the type of furniture, even the foundation under the floor all make huge differences. Heck, even the position your head is in (XYZ position in the room, direction your head is turned, even your haircut!!) makes a noticeable difference. There are many factors when it comes to room acoustics, and some people devote their lives to understanding them. Typically when it comes to audiophile forums, the closest things to room acoustics you see people discussing are how to point your speakers.

2) Recording quality. Now, I know this does get some good attention, but to me it doesn't get enough. This is probably the MOST important factor, in my mind, when it comes to how the end product sounds. Let's say it was possible for a set of speakers in a set of conditions to PERFECTLY reproduce a track. Well, if the original recordings were crappy, you will hear crap in all it's glorious definition. I find myself reading post after post about buying expensive equipment that can improve some minute quality of the reproduction, but very rarely do I come across a post that gives links to quality recordings. I'm not talking the bit rate of the recordings here, I'm talking about the original recordings taken. Personally I listen to a lot of classical music, but I find that I'm very often unhappy with the recording quality, which I can't change at all. Because of this, I find myself listening to more popular music, but that's annoying both because popular music is often annoying and because it has its own set of faults like being compressed to the point that there is hardly any dynamic range. I have my own tastes in music, but when it comes down to sitting down, closing my eyes, and really listening, I would rather listen to a high quality recording of something I didn't love than a crappy recording of something I did. Kind of sad, I know, but that's why you go see your favorites live, I suppose.

Don't get me wrong, I think that discussions about fine-tuning your system with certain high-quality parts and high bit rate tracks and offboard DACs and what not are completely reasonable. I think that to be an audiophile is to be in search of the perfect system for you, whether out of a love for having the best, a love of looking for the best, or because the irritation and frustration of sound quality drives you to keep looking. I'm not saying we should STOP talking about the little (albeit often expensive) details. I do think, however, when it comes to the actual listening experience, we are very quick to buy thousands of dollars of equipment that will make the sound better, when in reality moving the coffee table would make a bigger difference.

I was in the market for a new reciever.  I new all I wanted was great processing and amplification and the ability to do DTS-MA over HDMI.  Now just about every receiver on the market these days can do HDMI, but to get good amps you have to go up market, and that also means you are paying for bells and whistles you don't need.  Since I have no need for 3D I knew I could look at older receivers with HDMI 1.3, and I also don't really care much from the streaming apps most new receivers come with these days, so I threw those out the window as well.   This led me to a used listing on Amazon for a [Denon 4308](http://www.hometheater.com/content/denon-avr-4308ci-av-receiver). 

This is a machine that when released was a $2400 behemoth.  How much did I pay?  $400.  I can guarantee you right now you cannot find anything new at even twice that price that will be able to touch this bad boy.

So again, my lesson ... BUY USED."	t5_2qmiy	True

I do lots of headphone recommendations online, so I compiled this for over a few months. It saves me time and prevents me from forgetting things. I also link it to people so they can see how many options they really have, and that it's not just the select few that I see recommended so often. Wherever I post a link to it, people seem to like it and it helps them quite a bit.

I'm also posting it hoping you guys will provide suggestions or corrections if you have them. I update it pretty frequently, and I'm thinking of making an interactive website based on the guide so it's prettier and I'll be able to add more info to specific headphones. Easier said than done, of course. 

I'm considering adding more labels, hardware, and perhaps a guide for asking for advice. I see too many people asking ""What are some good headphones?"" which is always met by ""Budget, music preference, form factor, etc.?""

I hope this guide can help you guys, it's helped me a lot!

**Remember: The ""Report"" button is _not_ a super-downvote that magically makes content you disapprove of disappear.  Use the report button only when the post is clearly spam, off-topic or has been explicitly stated as being unwelcome here**

What to not report:

* Memes: No. Personally, I am not fond of them either, but so far, they have not been a big issue for /r/audiophile - there are very few gif threads, quickmemes, advice animals or other types of content that is so prevalent in the default subreddits, and as such there is no reason to ban them
* Novelty items - when McIntosh releases a USB flash drive that looks like a tube amp, it's probably not the most _interesting_ content, but in the very small volumes we see here, it's not really a problem either

What to report:

* Spam
* Harassment
* Posting of personal information

Also, if you _do_ report spam or harassment, we would appreciate it if you [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faudiophile), detailing the events a bit further - that way, we will likely catch it faster.

Also, if you disagree with the policies as they are now, you are always welcome to post a thread or message the moderators, detailing your proposal.  If you post a thread with such proposals,, adding [META] to the title helps distinguish the content from other content. "	t5_2qmiy	True

1325181928.0	nv4x0	To all the 'new audiophiles', a dear message from one of you	mailor	71	10	44	"I've always been passionate about music, listened to it since I was very young, since when my father ""educated me"" with his pair of Koss Pro/5LC out of his New Audio Dimension Model 60 amplifier. I remember me listening to classical music out of this beautiful setting, a loving father and loving music.

Years passed, still loving music but didn't follow a straight path up to here. Bought a pair of Bose On-Ear a couple of years ago, thought they sounded good. Stumbled upon r/audiophile, got convinced I could have had better stuff for reasonable price.

Remembering my father's passion about music, decided to give this a try. Bought Sennheiser HD 25-1 ii for Christmas. Listend to some of my highest quality music, got blown away by the difference in detail with my old Boses. Impressed, but not quite.

I decided to get my father's audio system back on working. Marantz Imperial 7 speakers, Sanyo turntable, NAD m60 amplifier, and my senns HD 25 (the Koss did not survive time).

I thought my mac was enough to drive my senns. I though come on, this whole ""try an ampli, go DAC"" thing was a little bit out of my scope, I though I wouldn't appreciate the difference.

Found an old vinyl by Jethro Tull, you may have heard of Aqualung. Got this album in CD years ago, I've listened to it tens and tens of times, lossless.

What could ever be the difference, I thought.

I am currently listening to My God, and am completely blown away. This is the first track of the B-side of the vinyl. Before changing side I attached the HD25s to my mac and tried listening to the first track, Aqualung.

Fuck, I thought, that's not even close. That's damn empty, there's nothing but some sound in here, where the fuck is the life that blew my ears and brains a few minutes ago. Where is the detail of the drums, the perfect vibrant voice of the choir, the strings that keep vibrating and shakes you to the bones. 

It's not even the same thing. I could never have imagined such an abyss could exist between the two sources. Believe me, you all out there that don't yet know what am I talking about. I was unaware like you are 40minutes ago. Now I am completely blown away. Never heard nothing even close to this. Never felt such life express itself in my ears, never got shaken as much from anything I've ever heard, never kept my breath as long and hard as I am doing now listening to *Locomotive breath*.

I was lucky, I did not have to economically trust the guys here at r/audiophile, I already had such beauty at my disposal, for free. Now I know I can trust them, now I know what a difference the source can make, I see the importance of amplification, and precise output.

If you're not lucky as much as I am, make yourself a favor and trust the guys in here.

i love Reddit, and I was happy to see some of our CES coverage linked here.
Thought i'd pop in to say hello.
Truth is, I'm pretty new to the hi-fi game (started interning at Stereophile in 2009/worked in the micro-circuitry industry for a year after/now been at stereophile for about 2 years) so if you ask me any technical questions, it'll go straight over my head.

BUT. if you're interested in getting one of the big dawgs (john atkinson or mikey fremer or any of the writers really) to do an IAMA, i could probably convince them.

Either way, feel free to say hello! ask questions about the review process (how it goes down here at Stereophile)! any other questions you may have about the magazine/website! questions about budget gear! questions about headphones! i can handle some of it, but i get the feeling most of you are leagues ahead.

First off, I go to /r/audiophile because /r/hometheater is a bunch of people that can't tell a Sony from a B&amp;W. I dont ~~care~~ know about headphones and /r/avporn is nothing but pictures (as it should be).

But I just feel like this subreddit is getting a LOT of repetitive and generic posts. 

I don't want to scare away new members, but too many topics have been posted over and over again. Small room, need speakers, on a budget. What turntable should I buy? What headphones should I buy? (All too many of these posts should be posted to /r/headphones. But I have to pick my battles). What desktop 2.1 system do I buy? What kind of speakers are these? (GOOGLE!)

I don't mean to come off as a prick. Everybody around here is incredibly helpful. I mean our community is *rapidly* growing. And I strongly believe this to be because of the helpfulness of everybody around here. 

As I type this I feel like my main point is becoming more and more muddled. But I feel like there needs to be more distinction between what subreddits these posts should go in. 

/r/audiophile (You Are Here)

/r/headphones - Headphones/Portable Audio

/r/hometheater - Audio and visual

/r/vintageaudio - Classic/used audio

/r/diyaudio - Do-It-Yourself Audio NEW!

/r/audio - Pro Audio and Recording

/r/vinyl - Turntables &amp; Records

/r/CarAV - Car Audio and Video

/r/dvdcollection - DVD and Video covers

/r/SoundSystem - Large sound systems

/r/avporn - Photos of A/V gear

/r/audiojerk - The light (dark?) side.

I realize people post to audiophile because they want the most people to see their album, link, or question. But this is also a call to action to all of you! **Get in these other subreddits and become active there!** Thats the only way that /r/audiophile will become self filtering and back to its former glory of in-depth, intelligent, and unique discussions of audio."	t5_2qmiy	True

1375252106.0	1jemrp	Random audiophile story from a Craigslist ad.	dan1son	64	10	23	"I went to a house to pickup a row of 3 home theater recliners from a guy on craigslist last night.  The house was way out in the outer edge of the city... He was selling the house and moving so google immediately showed me an MLS listing for 170k for the house.  Not a fancy house and not in a great neighborhood, but whatever, he had a good deal on the seats I wanted.  

I walk in the place with the guy and immediately to the left is the most insane audiophile setup I've seen in someones house.  I immediately noticed 2 1.2kw McIntosh monoblocks on stands next to a rack of insanely high end gear (Esoteric cd player, MBL pre-amp, and some crazy power conditioner).  Next to those were speakers I didn't immediately recognize, but could tell they were special.  He also had a pair of HD800s on a stand and a Woo Audio tube amp sitting on top of the rack.  I took note, and followed him into the room with the chairs.  Sitting on the chairs when I sat down was a Meridian controller and in front of the chairs near the wall was a pair of smaller Meridian speakers (DSP5200).  There was an empty TV stand (obviously the TV had been sold or moved) so this was definitely a bedroom turned media room.  (I later found out he had DSP8000s as the fronts that he recently sold after I mentioned I saw a pair of the bigger ones on CL that he said were his). 

We quickly discuss the chairs and I hand him some cash.  Before moving them I say ""so... I noticed your McIntosh audio setup in the other room, any chance I can hear it?""  He was ecstatic that I cared.  Unfortunately the only thing he cared to discuss was the cost of each component (including showing the case the $5k speaker wires came in).  Turns out he's a Dr. and this is his house his daughter lives at while going to school and he keeps his extra gear here when he's rotating it out of his own house in another nearby city.  

Anyway... he cranks on some nice Audiophile type Jazz on SACD and I get closer to the speakers to inspect what they are.  They're MBL 111F hybrids.  I had seen the bigger MBL products in videos and such before, but had never heard them and wasn't familiar with their ""lower end"" line.  These things sounded incredible.  $140k incredible for the setup?  maybe not... but damn, they were stellar.  Fullest of full range, tight punchy bass, vocal perfection, imaging like I've only heard from electrostats, and the ease of reproduction like I've never heard.  They just seemed willing to reproduce whatever you asked. 

My brother in-law who was helping me move the furniture... one of the most frugal (and non audiophile) people I've ever met (one who mocks my even remotely high end purchases) made a comment when we got back to my house that sorta put some perspective on it.  He said to my wife, ""Well... I don't understand anyone who'd buy that kind of stuff.  But when he started playing that music it sounded like the damn sax was right over there, the drummer was over there, and the singer was right in front of them.""


TL;DR.  Went to buy furniture on CL, ended up listening to a $150k MBL setup (best system I've ever heard in a house) from a physician who only seemed to be concerned about having the most expensive everything possible.  "	t5_2qmiy	True
1371482390.0	1gipka	Pretty decent discovery in the trash	davdev	64	7	12	"I was taking my son for a walk on Saturday when I walked by a house with a sign that said ""Free Stuff"".  Normally I don't even bother looking because people are usually just trying to dump junk, but from across the street, I noticed two floorstanding speakers.  Expecting some white van crap, I thought I would take a look none the less.  I was pleasantly surprise to find two Boston Acoustics vr950's.  I immediately knew I wanted them, but I was a few blocks from home, pushing an 18 month old in a little plastic car.  

I was tempted to yank him out of his car and try to finagle the speakers in his place, but that wasn't going to work, so I sprinted home and threw the boy in his carseat and drove back as fast as possible.  I was convinced they would be gone by the time I got back, but as I turned the corner, I saw them there.  Jumped out as fast as possible and threw them in the back of my 4Runner.

I got them home, and quickly swapped out my JBL towers of my main system.  I was sure they were going to be defective, blown woofer or something, but as soon as I turned them on, I could tell they were in perfect condition.  Haven't a chance to really drive them hard yet to see what they can do, hopefully will be able to play with them a bit tonight.  Not sure if they will replace the JBL's or just be used in a secondary system, but I am pretty happy.


While taking the speakers, I also noticed a brand new propane tank, so I grabbed that too.  All in all not a bad trash picking experience."	t5_2qmiy	True

And just in time for the new Laura Marling album :) 

Upgrading from a Pro-Ject Debut Carbon (acrylic platter, speed box, 2M Red) and man oh man is this an upgrade. MUCH blacker blacks, balanced bass, and sparkling, airy highs. Still under 10 hours of break in and I'm hoping it doesn't change character much.

Was torn between this and the VPI Scout- decided to save at least a few dollars and hope it would be enough of an upgrade to justify it- so far so good. Running to a Pro-Ject Phono Box S to a Peachtree Decco 65 to Frugal Horns. 

I've always been an enjoyer of vinyl for the physical medium aspect- but never had the equipment to necessarily rival the overall accuracy of sound of my digital collection- I probably play 80/20 digital/analog. I finally feel that I'm enjoying the sound of vinyl more than digital- the records will definitely be narrowing or even overtaking that 80/20 gap in the future.

1354568233.0	147xaf	Audio Trends Over Time?	GodDamnit_IAMLONELY	63	11	64	"This post was prompted by some vintage equipment I've recently come across. The gear is back home, and I'm at Uni, so a more specific post is due in the future. But it has brought up several questions, and I thought a reflective/informative/discussion thread would be pretty nice.

Things I have noticed in vintage gear vs modern equipment (obviously specific observations, not applicable to entire decades of audio engineering at all price points, but things that sparked questions):

* Speaker cabinets seem to be much smaller these days, especially in non floor standing speakers.
* Number of speakers per cabinet seems to have been reduced on average.
* Speaker sizes have changed from 12-15 inch woofers in a cabinet with mid and high speakers, to speakers about half that size as mid/woofers, with sub woofers in a separate box.
* Speaker design, where those large woofers mentioned above have relatively tiny magnets compared to similar sized and even smaller speakers today. The materials, magnet size, voice coil size, etc. change with new technology, I know. But *why* specifically is it that such changes have taken place?
* Amplifiers seem to have much more power on average (both rated and actual) than they used to. Vintage amp with 15 watts per channel drives large vintage speakers as loud as I could want, so why do I need such dramatically increased wattage for today's equipment of similar size and volume?
* Anything else others have noticed over time?

Obviously, I'm much less educated than the majority of /r/audiophile users, so I'm looking to you men and women to learn not necessarily about pure facts and figures from an engineering standpoint, but contextually and musically why trends exist the way they do, and what those trends actually are? What things shaped the development of audio equipment 40 years ago? What things shape it today?

Thanks for all the great responses that I'm sure will come, and sorry about any naivety on my part.  "	t5_2qmiy	True

Two of my favorite albums ever because of the production quality:

Sixpence None The Richer
http://open.spotify.com/album/6HGNrA7twXCXBRQ2Rvc0kS —this album starts out humble and unsuspecting with the first few tracks sortof just priming the pumps. A thorough listen through makes my heart melt. Not perhaps the BEST album for an audiophile to geek out over, but the first one that came to mind.

The Love Below – Outkast
http://open.spotify.com/album/1UsmQ3bpJTyK6ygoOOjG1r —ignore CD1. It might actually be good, but I'm not really sure who cares about it. Andre 3000's half of this double-release is mind-bogglingly sophisticated for such a kitch album. Something about the influences of jazz and cinema and hip hop culture on Andre makes the whole production and storytelling sweet but zesty. Andre's a phenomenal musician and balances the weights of all the sounds super well. This is the album from which ""Hey Ya!"" comes.

I was just in a Starbucks getting a monday afternoon pick-me-up.

The guy in front of me was dressed in classic style: American Eagle jeans, American Eagle shirt, American Eagle cap, and Beats classic headphones around the neck. Before this turns into a Beats-bashing thread, let me just say we all know better already, and for this guy maybe it fit his style. To each their own.

When he got up to the register, the cashier told him ""sweet headphones man, I was thinking about getting some of those."" The Beats' owner replied ""yeah man, they're pretty great. Really expensive but I think they're the best."" Misinformed, etc, but that's expected. Whatever, it was just smalltalk.

When I ordered my coffee the Beats guy had already left, and of course I had to say something. I was just like, just so you know I don't think Beats are very good, there are lots of cheaper options that are even better. Started discussing a few brands, Sennheiser, AKG, etc. The guy knew what he was talking about. He said ""yeah I really just want something that's not Apple"" and ""I don't know if I want a studio sound.""

Now here's the fun part. Before I could even mention it he said, ""reddit audiophile, that's the place.""

Yep, sure is.

We're helping the real world find better audio r/audiophile! Don't give up hope.

Starbucks guy, if you read this, there's a place called SoundLion nearby where you can try out a bunch of different headphones (including Beats for comparison), with really knowledgabe staff. Check it out."	t5_2qmiy	True

So, last week, I [posted a survey](http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/1ez3qe/survey_highres_vs_lossy_the_reboot/), asking you to compare a file bought from HDTracks and the same file, from the same album, but bought in the iTunes Music Store.

Well, I gathered as many responses as I could, and announced it both across the audiophile subreddits, and some subreddits less focused on audiophile things, but mostly to groups with an interest in music. (/r/samplesize being the exception).

I let the survey run until I was down to less than a handful of responses daily, closed it, and then gathered the results.  I then bribed /u/superapplekid into doing some statistical analysis on the results - to ensure that the results and conclusions were sound.  He deserves a gift of [gold](http://www.reddit.com/gold/about) for his contribution.

Well, here are the results, collected from 138 users. First, and I freely admit this is to tease you a bit, I'm going to do the demographics:

## System types

It seems that redditors, at large, are headphone users, and that a majority of the headphone users stick to closed on- or over ear headphones.

|  System type  | Count | Percentage |
|:-------------:|:-----:|:----------:|
| Headphones    |92     |67%         |
| Loudspeakers  |46     |33%         |

The full breakdown can be seen in [this chart](http://media.veven.org/2013/05/system_types.png)

## System cost

It also seems that redditors overwhelmingly do this audio thing on a tight budget, with the largest group being the $0-250 group, and the median being in the $250-500 group.

|  System cost  | Count | Percentage |
|:-------------:|:-----:|:----------:|
|$0 - $250      |64     |48%         |
|$250 - $500    |33     |25%         |
|$500 - $1000   |21     |16%         |
|\&gt;$1000        |16     |12%         |

(Again: A [pie chart](http://media.veven.org/2013/05/system_cost.png))

## The results

Well, this is what you came here for.

And ... here is what you answered:

|  Preference   | Count | Percentage |
|:-------------:|:-----:|:----------:|
| Clip A        |71     |51%         |
| Clip B        |35     |25%         |
| No preference |32     |23%         |

(And in a [pretty pie chart](http://media.veven.org/2013/05/prefered_clip.png))

So, how do one analyze this?   Well, if there was no difference between the clips, you would expect the distribution of responses to be relatively uniform between A, B and ""No preference"", perhaps tilted towards ""No preference"", since that would imply people couldn't tell the difference.  In this case, though, the distribution isn't uniform, and thus we can assume that there is a difference. To borrow /u/superapplekid's analysis of this, with some numbers, even:

&gt; To determine if respondents have a preference between the three options we perform a simple goodness of fit test. This tells us how likely it is that our final distribution would occur given random choosing. The answer is that it would be very unlikely, with a p-value of 3.574e-05. This assumes each option has a 1/3rd probability of being selected, which is actual a very generous assumption; in reality if there were no audible difference we might expect more responders to pick the 'No Preference' option, which is the opposite of what our distribution shows.

Now, when we have established that there is a difference between the two clips, we can eliminate the ""No preference"" votes from the survey, and simply look at the A vs B, we are left with the following distribution:

|  Preference   | Count | Percentage |
|:-------------:|:-----:|:----------:|
| Clip A        |71     |67%         |
| Clip B        |35     |33%         |

(And if you prefer pie charts, [here it is](http://media.veven.org/2013/05/orangered-vs-periwinkle.png))

And, with only two options, you can start analyzing the results in much the same way you would analyze the results of an ABX test - in other words, is the result pure chance or not - did those responding to the survey and choosing A or B make some sort of informed decision, or did they decide by a simple coin flip.  Again, I'm going to quote superapplekid - since he formulated this much better than I could:

&gt; Looking at only the responders who had a preference we can test to see if they preferred Clip A over Clip B by treating the choice as a binomial random variable, where probability P is the chance of choosing the lossless file, and P=0.5 translates to no preference between them. This test is analogous to seeing if the chance that a choice between Clip A and Clip B comes down to a coin flip. The resulting p-value is 0.000303 for the null hypothesis, meaning we reject it and instead claim that responders who had a preference preferred Clip A over Clip B. While 70% of responders who had a preference preferred Clip A, the possible lower bound due to sampling error (95% confidence interval) would still be non-random at 58% having a preference for Clip A.

In other words: **We can with reasonable certainty conclude that there are audible differences between the two clips, and that Clip A is the preferred one**. 

We can also then say with the same reasonable certainty that people, in this case prefer the lossless version, which was, indeed Clip A.

1360263493.0	182vfm	"Why a lot of the ""high quality"" formats make no sense."	nikrage	92	47	142	"I'm currently studying audio engineering and I believe a lot of the audiophiles are misinformed about how audio works. 16-bit 44.1 khz audio is enough for everything you will hear. You will **NEVER** recognize any difference above that. 

16 bit has dynamic range of -96 db to 0 but if it is dithered properly it can go to -146 to 0 where 0 is the loudest possible sound. If you listen to some extremely dynamic classical music it might have about -60 to 0 dynamic range. 

The human ear can hear up to 20 khz. I personally hear up to 19khz because I'm young but most people hear up to 16-17khz. 44.1 khz produces absolutely perfectly up to 20 khz which is enough for every human living on this planet (unless you are superman or something). Other formats 48 khz, 96 khz I believe are useful for movies and video in general because of the way audio and video cooperate together (some mathematical relationship for better workflow I guess) but it doesn't sound better than 44.1 khz - they do the same thing as 44.1khz but the filter extends further after the niquist frequency (which in this case is 20khz - even 192khz starts dropping after 20 khz. It's just a longer line.) They have their purposes in the studio when you are recording. Actually 192 khz might sound worse on some systems because there is a possibility of distortion/modulation in high frequency harmonics. The only reason for using higher than 16 bit 44.1 khz is in the studio. I suggest you also see http://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html#toc_1bv2b and [this](http://www.xiph.org/video/vid1.shtml) video eplaining things in more depth. You can also google dithering if you are an enthusiast. ;)

Some users feel that headphone posts don't belong here for various reasons, mostly that they feel they don't belong here. I, and the other mods, do agree that there are a lot of headphone posts that do not belong here as well, but headphones are worthy of discussion here as much as speakers are. Instead of banning headphone posts here, we are going to be more careful moderating /r/audiophile and keeping ""entry-level"" headphone posts out of here. 

Stuff we don't want to see here:

* Questions about what entry level headphones you should buy. Those posts belong in /r/headphones. Do your research, there is no need for these posts here.
* Questions about what entry level DAC or Amp to get. There are plenty of knowledgeable people on /r/headphones that will help you.


Stuff that we do want to see:

* Pictures of your set-up as long as you describe what you're using, and a quick review of sorts. It doesn't need to be an essay, but share your thoughts, that will provoke discussion.
* Discussion of high-end headphones. There's no real line, it's more of a gray area, but use your judgement, discussions about the new $30 Panasonic headphone will be better suited for /r/headphones.
* Reviews of headphones high-end headphones. Again use your judgement. 

This is a rough draft and will be fixed up throughout the next few days and weeks while everything gets fixed.

Anyhow as stated in the title, It seems that almost every speaker review I read, it seems to say that the set of speakers are a 'steal for the price' and compares the performance to that of speakers 'many times the price'.  Are they comparing the very worst speakers you can buy for the price and comparing it to those?  I don't get it.  

I've read reviews for Definitive Technology, Aperion, Martin Logan, Salk, Ascend, PSB, Golden Ear, etc. etc.  They all claim to perform well beyond their price point, which btw are all in the $2000-$3000 range (which I'm looking at and I'm sure it goes for may other price points.  

Sure you can nit pick parts of the argument but I'm sure you get what I'm saying.  If all of these speakers perform at 3 times their value, where is this arbitrary value coming from?  This is a little annoying and misleading in my opinion.  They must be comparing them to some crazy exotic speakers signed by Victoria Beckham or something.  There are too many speakers that perform way beyond their price points it seems that if we were honest with ourselves, most would perform at their pricepoints... as they should.  Otherwise no one in their right minds would buy anything else.  

Please enlighten me as I feel confused.  Also, I don't think it's fair to say that this is because there are idiots paying for thousands of dollars for boxed sets.  There are too many speaker brands out there to say that 'perform' way beyond their 'price point'.  If anything, the boxed sets would perform below their price points, IMHO."	t5_2qmiy	True

No, I don't listen to FLAC music. No, I don't listen to Youtube-MP3-converter music. I guess I'm a sort of happy medium.

I have usually used iTunes in the past for its simplicity, media-management (otherwise my files would be all over the place), and clean interface.

I have *always* been attracted to Zune software's functionality of the interface. All the artists, albums, and songs were laid out in an extremely efficient manor. I loved it. However, Zune doesn't exist on Mac, and Zune doesn't auto-grab album artwork as nicely. I'm not a fan of the color scheme, either.

So I use iTunes. It gets the job done. I set the view-mode to ""Grid"", sorted by Artist, and it worked.

**Then the update came along...**

...and I love it.

[Look, all my Artists and Albums lined up together.](http://i.imgur.com/rQvLT.png) And instead of showing all the songs in a row to the right, like Zune, the songs and albums are smushed together, just the way I like.

[And look, all my albums can be all cool looking and stuff.](http://imgur.com/a/kTmXY) I'm literally never going to use this view, but hey - someone will, and it'll look *awesome* for them.

Genres are organized just like Artists, so you don't need a picture there. I won't use that view, either.

Songs is pretty similar to how it looked in the past - a bunch of songs all lined up in whatever order you chose. No picture needed there, either.

**""Okay, cool. Some Redditor likes the new look of iTunes. Does it actually add any functionality?""**

YES. There's one thing I left out about my ""Things I like about Zune"" mini-list. ""Now-Playing"". The ability to add songs to the ""now playing"" list on the fly. This is literally my most missed feature from when I had a Zune HD. Zune's desktop software could do it, iTunes could not.

[But now it can.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1bt5j5XE-s&amp;feature=youtu.be) That's a somewhat laugh-worthy video I just made of it in action. Unfortunately, I recorded at my native resolution (1080p) at the highest framerate possible, and my upload speed is anemic, so that video will be ""processing"" for a while. ~400mb of video takes a long time at 70kbps up...

Basically, iTunes lets you add tracks to your ""Up Next"" list. You can add them at the bottom of the list or the top of the list. It's superb that they've added it, and I can honestly say that I'll never install Zune again. *Note, you can also add individual tracks to the Up Next list, I just forgot to do that in the video. Right click a song to add it.*

If I find anything else noteworthy, I'll update this post. That's all for now, though. I give this update a **5/5**, and will be recommending for friends to make the update.

EDIT 1: You don't have to right-click a song to add it. When you hover over a song or have it selected, the same album that I clicked on in my video will appear, and you'll be able to add your song to Up Next that way. If you select multiple songs, [you'll be able to add them all at once by clicking any of those arrows.](http://i.imgur.com/Bu4eJ.png)

Also, since I realize this might not be considered standard /r/audiophile material, I should probably explain my reasoning for posting here. Everybody plays music (among us, at least), many of us have got to use iTunes. Boom. Relevant.

Any questions? If someone's at work or something and can't install iTunes but wants to know a little more, I'll do my best to find out for you.

EDIT 2: /u/Arve [has commented](http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/140i2v/itunes_just_updated_to_a_new_interface_id_like_to/c793l19) with a great feature, the new Compact View!

&gt;I really like the new iTunes.  In particular, the new Compact View.  [Small album highlighting some of the features](http://imgur.com/a/KwZcF).  Unlike the old compact view, this is a separate view, and can be kept open as the same time as the main iTunes view. 

EDIT 3: On Mac OS X I'm noticing a couple of differences. [As you can see here, there are a few more options in the Artists view. ""Gallery"" and ""In The Store""](http://imgur.com/a/uRX2I) As somebody that doesn't use iTunes to purchase music, and don't care about pictures of stuff (I listen to music for the music, not pictures of the band), neither of these features is at all useful to me.

The wires feeding into the electrostat panels has shorted, which created the lightning. This also sent one of the Adcoms into DC, which is why it was humming. Interestingly, the AC breaker in the basement tripped before the fuse in the Adcom blew, despite the fact that it was running DC.   
By some miracle, no actual damage was done. The next day, I coated the wires that had shorted with epoxy, and all was well. "	t5_2qmiy	True

It blew me away compared to the V0 files I'm used to hearing over a Klipsch iFi.

On my own stereo I can't tell the difference between V0, 320 kB/s, and flac, but I could easily tell the difference between V0 on my stereo and lossless files being played through the Naim. I can usually catch 192 kB/s vs V0, and I can always tell the difference between 128 kB/s and V0. However, this made me wonder why we cap MP3s at 320kbps. **Why is there no in-between bitrate, if .wav files are ~2000+ kB/s why is there no midway 640 kB/s mp3?** I couldn't find any relevant information on Google. Format limitation? Arbitrary decision? I can't tell the difference between V0 and 320 kB/s but I bet I could differentiate V0 and 640 kB/s, were such a thing to exist. 

Edit: Sorry if this is a dumb question or the wrong place, but this seemed like the best place to post and get answers from people who know what they're talking about.

Edit 2: My question was ""Why do MP3s cap at 320 kB/s?"", please stop telling me that the two stereos are too different or that I can't tell the difference between 320 and flac; that all may be true but is irrelevant to the question.

Not all of these albums are perfect. My Pluto's have a tendency to reveal every little flaw in an album. There were a ton of albums this and last year I liked from a musical standpoint, but didn't make the cut because the mastering was bad (Lana Del Rey - Born To Die, Field Music - Plumb come to mind). 


So here's my recommendations, feel free and drop your own in here or tell me mine suck:


Rock/Folk/Indie

* Steven Wilson - Catalogue Preserve Amass (imaging + soundstage awesome)

* Gillian Welch - The Harrow &amp; the Harvest 

* Richard Buckner - Our Blood (vocals particularly, not much else)

* Wilco - The Whole Love

* First Aid Kit - The Lion's Roar

Metal

* The Sword - Apocryphon

* Mastodon - The Hunter

Blues

* Gary Clark Jr.- Blak And Blu

* Joe Louis Walker - Hellfire

Electronic

* Eskmo - Language EP

* Kid Koala - 12 bit Blues (it's just fun)

* Lorn - Ask The Dust

* The Invisible - Rispah

* Tycho - Dive

Classical

* Yo-Yo Ma, et al - The Goat Rodeo Sessions

* Benjamin Grosvenor - Rhapsody in Blue: Saint-Saens, Ravel, Gershwin (this is wow)

* Hilary Hahn - Silfra

* Hagen Quartet - Janacek: String Quartets Nos. 1 &amp; 2 (re-release I think)

That being said, I recently picked up a set of Bose Companion 2's for $80. They are not great. I was caught up in the appeal of the brand name. I am just curious as to what exactly does Bose do to their speakers to achieve the (as I perceive it) ""faux-dynamic"" sound, and why does it work better for certain types of music than others? They actually sound relatively nice if listening to acoustic/softer music such as Counting Crows or Dave Matthews Band. Some electronic sounds decent enough such as Daft Punk, but harder rock music such as Clutch just comes out sounding bad.

Please don't turn this into a discussion of why you use foobar 2k. I am only trying to help iTunes users out. You'll also need Quicktime installed on your computer as it contains all of the audio format settings for iTunes.



* Open the sound control settings and select 16bit 44.1khz 
http://i.imgur.com/JsYOfLc.jpg



* Make sure all sound effects are disabled
http://i.imgur.com/XHqEg1c.jpg



* Open quicktime, click Edit, Preferences, Quicktime preferences, audio tab Then select Windows Audio Session, this is also known as WASAPI. This by-passes the windows sound mixer.
http://i.imgur.com/UrWIR9y.jpg



* Finally open iTunes and deselect all enhancing options, also disable the equaliser. (EQ)
http://i.imgur.com/rKqGhce.png


* Make sure the iTunes volume slider is at maximum and presto! bit-perfect!


You can only test this if you have an AV Receiver or processor and 24 bit dac. Simply play a dolby digital recording.

There's a lot of misinformation on the internet claiming that other players like Foobar 2k are much better sounding than iTunes which just isn't true, if a player is bit-perfect it should be identical in audio quality. They may have features like sample rate switching and exclusive mode which are nice but if setup correctly iTunes can output bit perfect audio, but this is only practical if all of your music is one format ie all ripped from CD's or AAC's or MP3's at 16bit 44.1khz.

I hope this helps someone out.

I think the list now covers pretty much all speakers from all popular manufacturers. Of course it is still not exhaustive.

A few columns that may not be intuitive. ""LF inches"" is the diameter of the the low frequency driver and ""LF #"" is the number of said drivers. For bookshelves there is also the same columns for midrange and tweeter (MF and HF respectively). For floorstanders I added a fourth column MB between LF and MF for 4-way speakers.

I've also added a few charts that I found interesting. Notably plotting price, weight, and the low frequency driver area against low frequency extension. Of the three weight turns out to be by far the best predictor of LF extension. LF driver area is the worst predictor of the three.

I used to visit often, but now I was getting a little older (around 14) and I noticed his equipment.

He was an electrical engineering student, and he had *amazing* gear!  He had a Technics turntable, Harmon Kardon tape deck, Marantz receiver (like the ones you all drool over), L/R speakers hanging out in the middle of the living room (that's how it appeared to me at the time), and a ""subwoofer"" (I thought, ""what the hell is that?"").  The whole system was shelved in a built-in wall unit that he constructed himself, and he set up a dedicated power line for the system and everything.

He musta spent close to $5000 for it (I'm talking early 80s), from the fruits of a college job (handyman at the dorms).  And he had all the most awesome music; so many jazz greats I'd never heard of; the Alan Parsons Project; Steely Dan; Earth, Wind and Fire (such great vocals); and so much more.  Billy Joel on LP is awesome.

He wound up making his own phono pre-amp for his electrical engineering senior project.  He even used tubes!  I remember how he boasted that the parts cost him $300, but how it sounded better than equipment selling for over $500 (keep in mind, we're talking early '80s).  He played music for me via the Marantz receiver, then shunted the phono signal to his preamp, and it was like the music *came alive!*

I wound up spending whole summers in his living room trying to make mix tapes(!) with best-quality cassettes.

[This article](http://www.avrev.com/music-disc-reviews/dualdisc/audioslave-audioslave.html) goes into detail. 

I just learned about this and found one sold for just over $100 on [eBay last week.](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Audioslave-self-titled-dualdisc-cd-dvd-Soundgarden-Rage-Against-The-Machine-rare-/150926414936?pt=Music_CDs&amp;hash=item2323ea5458&amp;nma=true&amp;si=vBSjdilaYIa4MQlI2LJvEwynHWU%3D&amp;orig_cvip=true&amp;rt=nc&amp;_trksid=p2047675.l2557)

Needless to say, I'm looking for anybody who has this and would be willing sell it to me or help me get my hands on it. If it is indeed higher quality and extremely rare, I think a lot of people would benefit from hearing the superior version but so far nobody has ripped it to .flac or made an iso of it or anything. I would venture to guess that this could potentially sound better than the 24bit 96kHz 180g vinyl that's currently available.

I'll be keeping an eye on eBay if another one turns up but I thought I'd check with /r/audiophile first.

1369342987.0	1exf9s	A survey: High-res vs lossy (from legal sources). Can you hear the difference?	Arve	54	17	52	"**Edit:** Survey is now closed - I will post results soon in a new thread, and comment on some flaws in the test.  Also, expect the test to be rerun soon with new test files (and more choices)

**Edit 2:** I have started a second survey that avoids the flaw of this first test. The new survey is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/1ez3qe/survey_highres_vs_lossy_the_reboot/)

Well, the question here is, when I don't have the constraint of keeping the topic readable:

Can you hear the difference between a 24/88.2 ""Studio master"" lossless edition of a song, and the 44.1 KHz ""Mastered for iTunes"" lossy (256 kbps) AAC version of the same song?

This is something I said I would do in the [thread about the HDTracks version of ""Random Access Memories""](http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/1et48i/daft_punks_ram_from_hd_tracks_2488_version/).  Note that it took me some time from when I first decided that I wanted to test, until it was ready, because I wanted to keep the test within legal limits - in other words, I had to search for a candidate clip of about 30 seconds, and I also wanted to find the right candidate, which took about 50 complete listens of the album.

I've prepared two clips of the intro to ""Lose Yourself to Dance"":

1. One from the [high-res version you can buy on HDTracks or Qobuz](http://www.discogs.com/Daft-Punk-Random-Access-Memories-%C3%89dition-Studio-Masters/release/4581717). This file is originally in 24/88 format, and the only thing that has been done to it is to cut it to length and saved as WAV.
2. … and one from the Mastered for iTunes version, converted to WAV, and very carefully upsampled to 88.2 kHz so file size and sample rate matches.

I've then prepared a Google survey that basically seeks the answer to one question: ""Which clip do you prefer, A or B?"". It asks you a couple of extra questions about your system, and what equipment you primarily used for listening to the test clips, and your system settings. Note that you should only fill in the survey once.

* [Google survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BVXFR4FLdKw8KpB6vPu2g5c5dcxfK8nwTpCsNt7GWQM/viewform)
* [Test files](http://www.mediafire.com/download/i15jzh46pza5nip/lossy-vs-lossless.zip) (25.5 MB zip) - [Mirror 1](http://media.veven.org/2013/05/lossy-vs-lossless.zip)


I'll keep the survey open until I have a reasonable number of responses, and will publish the data shortly after that (I'll quite probably publish the raw data, so people with a background in statistics can analyze them).      Please participate - since this is only two short clips, and merely asking you to subjectively tell which clip you prefer - it could take as little as five minutes, or as much time as you personally like to spend on it.

(I'll be crossposting this to a few other audio-related subreddits).

1) One of the speaker's front (not the grille, the *entire* front) came to me half-unglued. I mean, it was off-kilter and loose, and I lightly pulled on the front and could see all the way inside the thing. They must've just run out of glue at the factory and thought ""eh, fuck it, it's half glued, what's the diff"", stuck ""QC PASSED"" on the back and clocked out for the day.

2) The speakers, when mated with the lepai 2020a and a AT-LP120 USB turntable, would make the amp cut out (blue light flutters off and no sound) at any volume over 3-4. When it was set to really low volume, it was fine, though. Now, whether it was the amp or the speakers fault, who knows. All I know is they're BOTH going back today.

So, those micro-budget audiphileabees out there, take heed to this and to ZeosPantera's warning. The build quality and sound quality are just not there anymore with the Dayton's. Save your shekel's (which is what I'm doing)."	t5_2qmiy	True

1360534323.0	189oz5	Comparison of the very first mp3 encoder vs. a modern mp3 using LAME	ygaddy	47	7	13	"Inspired by [this thread yesterday.](http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/1880b5/mp3_came_out_in_1995_surely_there_are_higher/)

In order to demonstrate just how much mp3s have improved over the years, I tracked down what is purported to be the very first mp3 encoder, l3enc.  Version .99a of l3enc was released in 1994. [LINK](http://web.archive.org/web/20070927014154/http://www.rjamorim.com/rrw/l3enc.html)

Now, the first release of l3enc only runs under DOS, so I first had to get a DOS environment. First I tried DosBox (an emulator), but it ran **glacially** slow.  Like, it would have taken hours to encode a single song. I eventually found the tweaks that got DosBox running acceptably fast, but in the meantime I got FreeDos up and running in a VirtualBox virtual machine.  Much faster.

The song I chose to encode was ""Discipline"" by Nine Inch Nails.  Before you start throwing things at me, I chose this because I had it in lossless and it was released under an open license (Creative Commons BY-NC-SA). Also, I knew the hi-hats would stress the encoder nicely.

The results are here: https://spideroak.com/browse/share/ygaddy/reddit

You can click on the 'spideroak_public"" folder to see the individual files, or you can click the download button for a ZIP of the folder.

~~Now, the mp3 output I got out of l3enc seems broken in some regard.  It's probably my fault, I suspect I didn't get the stream into a proper container or something. It plays back on some software, but it doesn't work on others. For ease of comparison, I transcoded the l3enc output back into flac using ffmpeg. So if the Discipline_l3enc99a_128k.mp3 file doesn't work for you, try the Discipline_l3enc99a_128k.flac file.~~

L3enc needs to be used with its own reference decoder. Distributing the mp3 output of l3enc is thus kind of pointless, so I used the reference decoder to convert it to WAV, then compressed it with FLAC.

I also encoded it with LAME v3.99.5, the latest release of LAME from February 2012.


As for which file is which:  
Discipline.flac - the original  
Discipline_l3enc99a_320k.mp3 -encoded with l3enc at 320kbps  
Discipline_l3enc99a_128k_Reference.flac -encoded with l3enc at 128k, decoded with their reference decoder, re-encoded to flac  
Discipline_lame3995_V5 -encoded with LAME 3.99.5 at V5, the VBR setting closest to 128k  
~~Discipline_l3enc99a_128k.flac -the l3enc encode converted back to flac~~  
~~Discipline_l3enc99a_128k.mp3 -encoded with l3enc at the default 128k setting~~

I'll entertain suggestions on different codec settings or different audio samples (must be redistributable).

EDIT: Added spectrals, l3enc at 320kbps  

EDIT 2: Ugh.  It seems that for some bitrates, the output of l3enc .99a isn't quite compatible with normal mp3 decoders - their reference decoder should be used.  ~~Further edits forthcoming~~, disregard the 128k l3enc stuff.

Edit 3: Removed the earlier l3enc 128k stuff. Apology to those who grabbed it before. Added a flac of the 128k l3enc output.  Sounds a lot better than I would have thought."	t5_2qmiy	True

1307486998.0	hu4qn	/r/audiophile direction and goals, and some ideas. Discuss!	calinet6	45	4	24	"Hey fellow /r/audiophiles.

I want to just take a moment to discuss this subreddit and what it's goals and direction should be. This is sort of sparked by some comments I've received here and elsewhere, and partly by my own opinions. My main goal here is to start a discussion, see what people want out of this, and see if we can't lead it in the right direction.

First issue: An Audiophile 101/Audio Primer page. I'd say at any given time, 80% of what this subreddit actually does is give advice and suggestions about various aspects of audio. This is awesome, and we're a generous and helpful group, but I think a single page where we could point people would be a great thing. 

I'm going to lay out the following sections that I envision off the top of my head, but we could definitely build on this over time and keep improving it wiki-style.

 * Intro to Audio (General Useful Knowledge)
 * Primer on Audio Quality (Overview, Big Picture, How to Listen, etc.)
 * Intro to Speakers
 * Intro to Headphones
 * Digital Audio Playback (Computer/CD/DVD -&gt; Amplifier - covers DACs, Interfaces, Sound cards, etc.)
 * Digital Audio Formats
 * Amplifiers and Receivers
   - Solid State
   - Surround
   - Tubes
 * Headphone Amplifiers (+DACs, DAC/Amps, Portable Amps, etc)
 * Portable Sources (iPod, Sansa Clip, Phones, CD Players, etc.)
 * Vinyl and Phono
 * Cables/Wiring (should contain 1 link to monoprice and general instructions on how to hook things up)
 * Brand/Buyers Guide - 2-3 Recommendations in each above device category at *several* different price points; going for ""If you get this, it's guaranteed to sound *pretty darn good* for the price; although preferences may vary.""
 * Brands/Products to Avoid - Similar to above, well-thought-out reasoned explanations on why not to buy, e.g. Beats, or certain Bose headphones.

Open to discussion, of course. I'd love to work on a guide like this, because it would mean that every time someone comes in and asks ""What headphones should I get,"" or ""How do I hook up my speakers,"" or ""I'm putting together a new system, what amp should I buy?"" I can just point them to one place and give a small amount of customized help, instead of reinventing the wheel every time. I think it could be awesome.

This leads me to the second item: the goal and direction of this subreddit in general. While, as I said, I love helping people with their audio questions, what I'd really like to be discussing are some of the more interesting audio quality info: new speaker models, listening tests, DACs, turntable decks and cartridges, great recordings, audio formats, the never-ending ABX debate, and more advanced audiophile stuff. I know others feel the same way based on some other discussions I've had.

I think we can strike a balance—people new to audio shouldn't be afraid of seeking advice, but at the same time, audiophiles shouldn't be scared away by there being 90% advice threads and not much else.

So what about everyone else? Why are you here? What would you like to see posted and discussed?

Now excuse me while I gather pictures of my new tube amp mods to post... :)

**tl;dr: 1. Would you be interested in helping with/reading an /r/audiophile wiki of collected greatness?  2. What would you like to see from this subreddit?**

\*edit: Progress! calbear81 has made me a mod, so I can help out with all the modly duties (traffic to this subreddit is going up quite a bit, by the way) and I've added a new logo and updated a few descriptions and titles. I'll also be watchful of the spam box, so if you see your post didn't go through or got flagged, please notify the mods and I'll be sure to take care of it.

I'm also looking for a good place to host the wiki - I don't like the idea of using the reddit.com code wiki, as I want it to be more than one page and I'd rather not have the ""fixit"" logo at the top as on the code wiki pages. But we'll see, whatever works best. I'll keep everyone posted on progress. Thanks again for all your comments and support!"	t5_2qmiy	True

After several months of using my tv as the center speaker (with some annoying echo problems) I came here. I searched for my problem and there was another user with the same problem, you all came to his rescue and thus mine. Turns out I was so worried about potentially ruining the speaker that I never thought there would be regular old speaker wires inside.

However, now... Now I am sitting here just listening to music. Why?

I was out, wanted to replace my crappy $15 in-ear headphones because they were just so bad sounding. I knew Sennheiser was a good brand, but didn't know if they had anything in my price-range. Poor college kid, just having moved to NYC, I didn't want to spend too much. I was at a Guitar Center with my roommates, and saw a pair of $30 Sennheisers (Sennheiser HD201). I asked if I could try them out, I plugged them in. Was impressed. They weren't fantastic sounding, but they were better than what I had. Mind you, my higher quality headset (Razer Megalodon, still not high quality in your eyes. Not in mine either anymore) was damaged and was getting RMAed and was sitting in Texas, back home at this point.

Anyways, I brought my Sennheisers home, loaded up foobar, and started listening to music. A few days later, I messed with the equalizer which fixed my major problem with them. They sounded flat. Like there was no variation in the ranges of sound (or so how I thought). The equalization gave them a bit of a kick, but I also heard a few pops in my 320kbps music. I got some FLAC versions of a few of my favorite songs, and listened to them. They sounded by far better than what I was listening to before.

So now, here I am on Thanksgiving break, sitting in my room in Texas, listening. Listening to music like I hadn't listened to it before. My Razer headset? Sitting on the ground.

It is amazing, how even low quality headphones from a high quality brand can sound so much better than headphones from every other brand I have tried (Skullcandy, Beats by Dre, Monster, Razer). 

I am astounded. I finally see (hear?) clearly now. I want to get more into listening to music now with proper gear. It is amazing. I know that it can only go up from here.

Anyways, I was just wanting to say, I lurked in this sub from time to time, but now I think I am one to stay."	t5_2qmiy	True

1313399192.0	jj7jq	"Anyone else getting tired of audiophile ""snake oils""?"	venomae	43	5	39	"Hello /r/audiophile,

Im not really sure there are other people who feel like this, but Im getting rather annoyed by the amount of various ""snake oils"" that the audio vendors are trying to sell me.

First of all, Im not from US (but from Europe) so the situation might be different over there. However here, its getting out of hand. And its not just the vendors, but many members of various hifi / audiophile forums who are drinking the vendors / manufacturers koolaid.

I dont believe there is much difference in cables. There might be a minor differences in the materials but thats pretty much it. I dont believe in people being able to hear the difference between two cables from similar material (because as far as ABX testing goes, noone manage to confirm yet that they can actually tell the difference). I think people buying cables for x thousands of usd are either stupid or just trying to showoff.

Same goes for amplifiers. I dont believe that any amplifier is worth more than 3-5k usd max (in majority of the cases its probably way cheaper than that) and I certainly dont think the price difference is worth the audio difference.

And Im totally sick of people coming up with new terms how to describe something thats completely different for every one of us (and is differently perceived) and trying to sound really qualified and educated about it. Yea, I dont really trust anyone who goes around claiming that combination of X and Y brands has really ""analytical, japanese but not overly metalic sound, with a bit of muffled mids"".

It just feels like the art gallery stuff. You know, ""modern art"". Write a half page review about a picture with colors randomly splashed all over it and invent 10+ new adjectives during the writing (which noone can really understand anyway, as the perception of the ""art"" is subjective).

Anyone else getting annyoed by this? Im just ranting, but I kinda had to let the steam off a bit, cause usually when I try to discuss this on pretty much any audio / hifi forums, I get yelled down by golden ears audiophiles who can totally tell a difference between 10k and 15k speaker cable and who look down at you cause ""you dont know the difference, cause you didnt hear it on a decent soundsystem (like mine, which costs only 40k usd...)"".

Rant off.

1341581942.0	w4mav	Are you being completely honest when you say sound quality of vinyl trumps that of digital?	calonto	43	11	84	"So I'm just getting into music on vinyl, and I just spent around $600 on a new [Rega RP1](http://www.rega.co.uk/html/RP1.htm) with an [Ortofon 2m red](http://www.ortofon.com/products/cartridges/cartridges-2m-series/2m-red) cartridge, and a [Cambridge Audio (551P) preamp](http://www.cambridgeaudio.com/summary.php?PID=953&amp;Title=Azur+551P+Moving+Magnet+%28MM%29+Phono+Pre-amplifier). My speakers are [Audioengine A5s](http://audioengineusa.com/Store/Audioengine-5). 

I have to say, for a $600 investment (plus the $200 to $300 hundred I've already spent on vinyl), I'm not really sold, and maybe even a bit disappointed.

As I compare tracks: on vinyl tracks of Californication by RHCP, and Darken Her Horse by Austra for example: vocals are muddled and not as clear, bass is not nearly as punchy, and overall distortion is higher. That, and I just can't push the volume as high as I could on the digital version.

On top of that, there is quite a lot of noise coming from my preamp. With my turntable off, and as I turn the speaker volume up, noise increases - this of course can be heard and is quite noticeable when I'm spinning a record.

I've heard excellent reviews of the RP1, so good as to say it is better than the older P3.  So what does a guy have to do? Take back my RP1 to spend another 500-600 on upgrading to an RP3? Could there be a defect with my preamp? I'm not really into getting into an Amp and passive speaker situation (nor am I interested upgrading any of these components over time). 

I'm not even running my digital music through a decent DAC, just through an Airport Express and Airplay. It just seems to me, for someone on a smaller budget, vinyl is maybe not that accessible (if that’s the word) if you want to hear that quality.

Even with buying a complete system I had plenty of work to do to set up the system properly, I mean there was a reason for the previous owner to sell the system.  Swapping out the amp was the biggest, but these are also the most picky speakers for placement that I have owned. Took literally the last 15 months moving these 250lbs speakers some days inches some times clear across the room in frustration.

---------------------------

Again, **I know nothing about speakers** but these are things I've seen mentioned frequently. 

Types of speakers 

* [Active Speakers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_speakers) have an internal amp. Here's a [picture.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Active_loudspeaker.svg/250px-Active_loudspeaker.svg.png). I think most computer speakers have built in amps.
* Passive speakers lack an amp. If you buy passive speakers, you're gonna need one. 

Amps- Popular ones mentioned

* Popular ones mentioned: [Dayton](http://www.amazon.com/Dayton-DTA-100a-Class-T-Digital-Amplifier/dp/B004JK8BDK/ref=sr_1_9?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322387040&amp;sr=1-9)

Converters

* [FiiO D3 Digital to Analog Audio Converter](http://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Digital-Analog-Audio-Converter/dp/B0053VKP8S/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top)- Converts digital to analog.
* USB version [FiiO E7 USB DAC and Portable Headphone Amplifier](http://www.amazon.com/FiiO-E7-Portable-Headphone-Amplifier/dp/B003E6K1VK/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top)
* This is a [USB audio interface/ external sound card](http://www.amazon.com/Behringer-UCA202-Audio-Interface/dp/B000KW2YEI/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322389233&amp;sr=8-9). It has SPDIF  ouput, analog inputs and outputs. 

Types of Cables

* This is an [analog RCA cable](http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-PureAV-RCA-Audio-Cable/dp/B00022TN86/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322386620&amp;sr=1-1).

Things that need explanation. 

* When do you need a DAC (digital analog converter)? USB or regular? 
* When buying an amp, how do you know how much wattage you need?
* I also mention nothing about subwoofers. 
* Build a PC has a chart that shows how to get the most bang for your buck. This would be extremely useful but a huge undertaking.  "	t5_2qmiy	True

1374412524.0	1iqynb	XPOST: r/headphones: Review: Koss ESP-950		39	5	8	"OK, r/audiophile. Since /r/headphones is flooded with $100 budget recommendations,  let's talk electrostatic headphones here. And maybe a little bit about sake.

For those who may not know, there are three prevailing methods to coax sound out of discs placed near your ears.

1) Dynamic: A magnet is attached to a cone, which is affixed by a pliable membrane. The magnet is driven by the oscillations of an electromagnetic coil. This includes the ATH-M50 to the HD-800, as well as my 1993 Klipsch RF3's.

2) Orthodynamic: A thin metal plate is suspended between two perforated grids of magnets. An electric current is then passed through the plate, causing it to oscillate in the magnetic field. Here, we find the Fostex TRP-50 (holla at yo Mad Dogs!!) to the LCD-3 and HE-6.

3) Electrostatic. Fuck yes (spoiler!). A thin membrane, usually of mylar, is suspended between two similar plates (sometimes copper-clad PCB.) A static electric charge is applied to the membrane. Varying static electric signals are sent to the two opposing plates, causing the ultrathin membrane to vibrate. Headphones here range from the Koss ESP-950 to the Stax 009 all the way to the motherfucking, cuntlicking, dicksucking Sennheiser Orpheus. Fuck that bastard.

I purchased a Koss ESP950; however, I have listened to every single one of the headphones that I have listed above. Why?

Transparency and affordability. Transparency, to me, makes the headphone sound ""real"". As in, if I close my eyes, I'm there. Not listening to a headphone; not listening to Robert Plant's amplifier; no, I'm listening to Robert Plant. Transpaency means I can hear his goddamn vocal cords vibrating and Jimmy Paige's fingers sliding along his fretboard. Though I love my RF3's, my ESP950's simply embarass them for solo listening.

I went to my first Head-Fi meet expecting to love the HE-400, based on everything I had read online. Sure, it sounded great. Nevertheless, I couldn't shake the sheer, awe-inducing sense of realism that I heard through the Blue Hawaii / SR-009 setup.

I believe -- though measurements could prove me wrong -- that electrostatic diaphragms behave as close as is currently possible to the goddamn signal, due to their incredibly light weight (low m double dot, for my fellow mechanical engineers.)

Koss produced, in goddamn 1992, a pair of electrostatic headphones. They wanted nearly $2K, but today, you might find them new for $600. This includes the necessary electrostatic amplifier. They have the speed I heard in the SR-007. With simple equalization, they easily surpass the lows of the HE-6. Do they equal the sheer majesty of a pair of Orpheus, driven by a Blue Hawaii? No. But, again, they cost $600-700. And I assure you, with that, you'll get much closer to the music than the the HD-800's driven by a Bryston amplifier fed by a $1K DAC that I heard.

Also, apparently, sake makes your music library sound even better. I suspect wine might have a similar effect. And I can personally verify that Bud Ice does that, since I'm poor as fuck since I put the fucking ESP-950's on my credit card. But I swear to whatever god you believe in that the MOTHERFUCKING $20K SENNHEISER ORPHEUS only sounds about 20% better than a $0.7K Koss ESP-950.

This is my verdict. I'll take these over a $2K LCD3 and whatever fucking amplifier it takes to drive that heavy, sweaty, uncomfortable bastard.

I feel Robert Plant. I experience Explosions in the Sky. I try to convince my roommates to listen to my huge, 90's themed headphones.

Been a longtime lurker and friends have been little help on this front, so turning to the /r/Audiophile community for input and advice...

I recently upgraded my headphone setup to what I consider entry-level audiophile status. Here's the rig:

- Software: Audirvana+
- Source Files: FLAC (all minimum 16 bit/44.1 Khz)
- DAC: Schiit Modi
- Amp: Schiit Magni
- Headphones: HiFiMan HE-400s (velour pads)

Here are my planned upgrades:

- IFI iUSB Power Supply (http://www.ifi-audio.com/en/iUSB.html)
- Audioquest Cinnamon USB cables (http://www.audioquest.com/usb-digital-audio/cinnamon)
- Cablepro HiFiMAN Upgrade Cables (http://www.thecablepro.com/cablepro-earcandy-hifiman-he300-upgrade-replacement-cable.html)

I have a highly curated 30,000+ iTunes library that's been somewhat ignored since moving to this new setup (I even moved the whole library to my NAS to free up disk space for FLAC collecting). I've pretty much moved all my work/mobile listening over to Spotify streaming at highest quality, and then have my home setup for in-depth listening.

This shift in my listening approach, and slowly getting more educated on / acquainted with soundstage and instrument separation have generally made me a more attentive listener.

This has now led me on the hunt for albums that can be enjoyed to from start-to-end. Albums that have high production value, that are layered, albums that are made for headphone listening and really make you enjoy the time/money spent building a hifi listening setup.

I'm open to almost all genres (not into country/hardcore/pop), and have started building a list of full albums I really enjoy. Here they are (in no particular order):

- alt-J - An Awesome Wave
- Bon Iver - For Emma, Forever Ago
- Sebastian Tellier - Sexuality
- El-P - Cancer 4 Cure
- Twin Shadow - Confess
- Fiona Apple - The Idler Wheel
- Weezer - Blue Album
- Hidden Orchestra - Night Walks
- Neutral Milk Hotel - In The Aeroplane Over The Sea
- Interpol - Turn on the Bright Lights
- Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon
- Miles Davis - Kind of Blue
- Blue Sky Black Death - NOIR
- Amon Tobin - Isam
- Girls - Father, Son, Holy Ghost
- Cloud Nothings - Attack on Memory
- Wild Beasts - Smother
- Calexico - Algiers
- C2C - Tetra
- Grizzly Bear - Veckatimest
- Beach House - Teen Dream
- Foxygen - We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace &amp; Magic
- Metronomy - The English Riviera

Does anyone have any favorite, full-listen albums that they recommend? Specifically, if you moved from a regular to a hifi setup, did any of your older albums jump back out to you? Did any new ones stick out and really make you say 'wow'?

Here are two reference links that are helping:

- Beginning to End Albums: http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/14zytx/reddit_what_albums_can_you_listen_to_from_the/
- New to /mu/: http://i.imgur.com/xlN9d.jpg

Definitely interested in expanding my horizons, I know a lot of these albums are newer but I've just started the process of building a lossless collection and haven't dug into my past favorites just yet. Any suggestions are much appreciated.

Thanks all.

**TL/DR**: got a new headphone audiophile setup, really digging full-listen albums, posted a list of my current favorites, looking for solid suggestions.

**Update**: wow, thanks for all the comments everyone (and the input on USB power supply/cables). Some of these suggestions look great. I'll try to update this post as I work through the deep listening suggestions, and maybe make this into a running list that would be a good reference for people delving into full albums."	t5_2qmiy	True

I was hoping that someone could explain to me the basic concepts of bit-rate &amp; sampling as it relates to digital music files?  

Most of the music I listen is live-recorded music from either soundboard or audience sources.

I then recorded the output (digitally, through an external S/PDIF loopback, so there is no analog stage involved), and ran a null test between that and the original file. Here is a screenshot:

http://i.imgur.com/ZcFCw.png

If this product had been free, I would just have had a laugh. The fact that they are charging $50 make me angry.

Note that the first few seconds of audio appear quiet, and then it's suddenly as loud as if it was not a null test at all - this is because several times during playback, Audirvana had problems playing back - and halted for 20-30 samples at a time, meaning that what it outputs is anything but bit perfect.  In short, it's not capable of playing back a file without stuttering.

Now, if we assume that the stuttering (which is short enough, 0.5 ms, to not be noticeable, except perhaps the odd pop and click, depending on when it happens), what about a null test where it plays back correctly.

Well, suffice it to say, it doesn't null.  While I get a tiny bit of quantization noise when recording a fully digital chain from iTunes (at least -115.6 dBFS), I finally found a long enough segment from a track that seemingly nulled in Audirvana.  The remaining noise in the null was at -70.3 dBFS, which, you know, is audible as _noise_ in silent passages of a track, even at relatively moderate volume.

When you add the fact that Audirvana is probably the worst behaving piece of software I've had on this machine, as it, all on its own _changed my audio output options_ (What you see when you opt-click the volume control). Nobody touches that setting and gets away with it. Nobody.

I won't be recommending Audirvana to anyone, anytime soon, at any price.

**Edit:** Please read [this exchange](http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/14uhrr/so_i_tried_an_audiophile_music_player_for_os_x/c7gk6nb) between /u/KingCreole8 and me.  I retested by completely eliminating hardware from the test setup (Outputting to a dummy software device), in which case both iTunes and Audirvana is the same, something I didn't achieve when using with real hardware."	t5_2qmiy	True

For me I think it was to A/B speakers when auditioning.  It's amazing the differences you can hear when performing a direct comparison instead of going from memory.  This is why when people claim to suddenly hear 'things they've never heard before in a recording,' I get skeptical.  I wonder if it's due to the fact that in the audition the person is finally doing a critical listening session to test out a speakers' performance.  I've suddenly heard many new nuances within the same recording from the same set of speakers with nothing changed only because I was concentrating on what I was hearing instead of playing the music in the background while cooking.

You can either go the complete DIY route and build these from the plans- or order 'flat pack' kits from several people/companies if you don't have the time/tools/skill to cut the wood yourself- then simply assemble it. In my case, I ordered a kit from [Planet-10 Hifi](http://www.planet10-hifi.com) and put it together in my apartment with some simple clamps and wood glue. Building it from scratch would have made these MUCH cheaper- it was simply not an option for me. I'm in to these about $700 total at this point- but they could be built for less than half of that.

**Driver Selection:**

As mentioned, the Frugel Horn works well with several 4"" full-range drivers. I chose the [Mark Audio Alpair 7.3](http://www.markaudio.com) due to the overwhelmingly rave reviews it has gotten with other builders. These were also ordered through Planet-10, which is much more expensive, but provides the benefit of parameter matched drivers, pre-broken in, and put through the ""EnABLed"" process- which is more or less 'painting' a series of dots/lines on the cone that is supposed to improve the dispersion of sound. Does it work? Who the hell knows! I couldn't A/B them against non-EnABLed drivers so I have nothing to report there.  I purchased them from Planet-10 because of their break-in/matching process- not for the EnABLe process. It does make them look cool though :p Here are some photos:

**The Build:**

So here we go. The build was fairly uneventful- basically consisting of applying glue, clamping, and waiting. Here are the exciting photos of that process:

Don't forget to bring some clamps:

Ok- now it got a bit more interesting. Once assembled, you really can't be sure how full to stuff them with polyfill until you test them.. this step consisted of adding fill, clamping them shut, listening, then adding/removing fill material until the bass sounded nice, smooth, and flat. Without any fill, they are quite boxy sounding- the fill makes a WORLD of difference. Of course, the fill was provided by Planet-10 as part of the kit- thanks Dave!

**Finished?:**

Ok guys, I'm embarrassed to admit that I've had these put together for almost 3 months now and haven't applied any finish to the cabinets.. They basically look like that last photo sans clamps. The issue is two-fold:

1) I can't decide how to finish them. Paint vs stain vs veneer+stain. 
2) I'll have to take the drivers out and not be able to listen to them during the process!! 

Either way- when people come over- they've complimented how nice our speakers look ?? I mean, they look ok, but naked birch plywood is not my idea of nice looking. Regardless, I'll follow up with more photos once I actually 'finish' them..


**Review:**

My set up is a Marantz nr-1402 (a lower end Marantz receiver) providing a max 50watts. This is fed by a Pro-Ject Debut Carbon turntable with the Ortofon 2M Red cartridge- then through a Pro-Ject Phono S pre-amp. For digital, I stream a mix of 320 mp3's and ALAC lossless files through an Apple TV.

My initial reaction, before anything else, was that the bass coming out of these is absolutely unbelievable for a pair of 4"" drivers. That's a folded horn for you. From my research, I knew that these would get low, but it's still difficult to prepare yourself for that sound coming out of such small, innocent speakers. 

Now, with that said, these are still 'only' 4"" drivers. They do not thump your chest with kick drums and rattle windows with 'phat bass lines'. I would describe the bass as extremely complimentary of the rest of the response. That is, extremely musical- never overwhelming- but still has presence. The mid-low-bass region is where I have found so many speakers to have extremely peaky response. We've all heard it- where a 5 note bass line will go from one note being nearly inaudible to another note that is so loud it overwhelms everything. These have no such issues in my listening room- extremely flat response. 

Enough praising, the bass is also the largest downside to these in my set up. They simply don't get extremely low *with authority*. They *do* get down there to 40hz- the bass is there, but it's noticeably rolled off by that point. It's absolutely worth noting that these are meant to be 'corner loaded'- that is, angled into corners which acts as a natural bass-boost. In my room, I can only do that with my left channel- I don't question that a better layout would help that low bass response. For the music I generally listen to, this isn't much of an issue- but could be for others.

Let's talk about where these guys *really* shine. Vocals! Wow wow wow, I've not heard better. Credit to the driver design, but credit to full-range in general. Crossover points are the bane of nearly all 2 or 3-way designs. It's simply extremely difficult to blend that crossover range together. Full-range, obviously, eliminates crossover points and allows a single source for the entire vocal range- I'd say this has a lot to do with how well these do vocals, especially female. They simply sing- extremely impressive.

And finally, focusing on the upper-mid to highs- very detailed. The initial 'plucking' of a guitar strum is handled wonderfully. I listen to a lot of folk and these really breathe new life into my albums. If you've ever found it difficult to imagine what a reviewer means by 'detailed'- a listen to these makes it very clear what that means. For the ultra-highs- they are quite acceptable- cymbals are nicely detailed, but fairly laid back. These may not please those who appreciate the 'harsher' spectrum of a tweeter. These do appear to roll off a bit up there- a compromise of being a full-range driver.

Some other thoughts:

These are very directional and small adjustments to the placement of them make dramatic difference to their sound. There is really only one 'great' place to sit when listening (my seat of course :p ). I'll be adding outrigger feet in the future for greater control of the horizontal 'pitch' of the cabinet- elevating them slightly in the front seems to bring out the best soundstage. On that point- soundstage is remarkable for the size of the driver, but I can't help but feel it is missing something. Again, it is very placement-specific, but the feeling of 'wow- I'm at the concert' when closing my eyes isn't there as much as other, higher end, larger speakers I've auditioned. 

As far as loudness goes- it was something I was concerned about in my research- that they wouldn't get loud enough for my liking. I'm happy to report that these get PLENTY loud to fill a modest apartment with headroom to spare. Unless you have a HUGE space and demand ear-bleed inducing volumes, these get plenty loud without distortion.

**Conclusion:**

In the end, these have met or exceeded my expectations. For $700, I have not heard a better all-around speaker (I'd say I have about average exposure to high-end audio relative to those on this subreddit). The fact that these can be build for half of that is truly amazing. Very fun and rewarding project- I wouldn't hesitate to tackle it if you're looking for the best bang for your buck in this price range.

The good:
-vocals, strings, brass- holy hell this is detail. Really needs to be heard to be described.

The not-as-good:
-bass 'kick' and extension simply isn't what you'd get from a larger driver, won't satisfy bass-heads
-Soundstage is very good, but isn't knock your socks off spectacular

This is my first real Raspberry Pi project.  I decided I wanted an airplay box so installed Shairplay on my Pi.  That seems to work perfectly and has been for a few days.


I decided I wanted a little more though.  So last I night started thinking about Internet Radio.  I found a great guide here: http://contractorwolf.wordpress.com/raspberry-pi-radio/


I installed mpc and everything worked through the command line but I am running this Pi headless and didn't want to go into building hardware controls I just wanted to control it easily through my laptop or phone.


I created a quick and simple PHP application that let me submit a streaming link or select from a dropdown of saved links and play through the Pi.


I could have just used Shairplay to Airplay radio streams from my phone but... Well I just think this is cooler!

I'm using a pair of Sennheiser HD598 and an Auzentech X-Fi Forte as dac/amp, is this the problem?

Would a better system enhance the difference?

And would it be possible to hear ANY difference on a cellphone like a NOKIA N700 (It is able to play flac) plus a pair of 20€ Philips in-Hear?

In a headphones vs Hi-fi, in which one you would hear better the differences?

Sorry for my bad English and sorry if this has already been discussed but I didn't find it, plus I need an answer to the 20€ headphones question because some people are convinced that they hear an incredible difference between the two (mp3/flac) with them.


Thanks for you help!

**Edit 2**

I see to be getting some flack here for piracy, not supporting artists etc. so let me address some arguments here.
&gt;The quality of the recording is not dependent on the format of the file.

It is.  You can't accurately gauge the quality of a recording if the source is of poor quality


&gt;You can tell how good a recording is even at low bit rates.

Incorrect.  Listen to a 128kbps mp3 of Muddy Waters Folk Singer and the CD and you will notice the difference.  I think there is a need for people to listen to a proper copy of a song so they can judge whether they want to purchase it or not.


&gt;If you want high-quality music, fucking buy it and support the artists

I totally agree, dude.  In fact, everything I put up is a cd rip from music I loved enough to purchase.  I just want to spread the word and discover new music with like-minded individuals.  Clearly you are not so I won't see you there :)"	t5_2qmiy	True

Almost 20,000 tracks, 80% of which was 320 kbps mp3, and rerip the whole thing in flac. I'm about 5k tracks in thus far, but oh it's just so amazing. I can't bring myself to go to bed because I'm just so absorbed in my music. If any of you are still ripping mp3's, much less buying them, switch to flac if you can. This will surely be one of the greater turning points in my life :) If you're messing around with dac's and are still listening to mp3's, stop. Get lossless music, and then tweak. It's amazing!
**Edit**: I think I can tell the difference between 320 kbps mp3 and flac. So I'm gonna do some abx tests. It would be valuable for me know, as having mp3's on my phone is a lot easier than flac. I'm gonnna continue with flac, just because it's good for archival purposes, but I'll do the tests and report back.
**Edit#2** So I did a fairly short test, using four tracks. The tracks were: Gangnam Style by PSY, Gone for Good, by The Shins, Good Day Sunshine by The Beatles, and Good Girl, by Carrie Underwood. I'm not saying those are my favorite songs, but I just wanted to get a mix of genres, and recording dates. I had each track in flac, and then encoded an mp3 copy, using lame in foobar2000, at 320 kbps. I then used the ABX plugin to compare the tracks. Btw, I'm using a creative audigy se, with all enhancements off, and the headphones I decided to take to school, my Sony XB-700's, modified a bit. I gave myself about a minute for each trial. Here are the results: Gangman style: 8/10 times correct. Gone for Good: 9/10 times correctly. Good day Sunshine: 6/10 correct. Good Girl: 7/10 correct. First conclusion: It looks like I'm doing decently, but honestly, it was harder than I expected it to tell them apart. Second conclusion: It's harder to tell with older recordings, or at least it seemed to be. Lastly, I'd guess that I could do better with better equipment. I have a dac and stuff at home, along with nice speakers. Those would help. Considering how hard it was to tell them apart, I'll be fine with mp3's on my phone haha"	t5_2qmiy	True

The direct precursor to my question is the currently frontpaged thread about [Tuvan throat singing](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/ttcax/mongolian_throat_singing_mindfuck_begins_at_624/), because I started browsing for Mongolian artists and came across a recording titled ""Tuva, Among The Spirits: Sound, Music And Nature In Sakha And Tuva"".

The last time I was this gobsmacked about the soundstage, mastering and recording quality was when I first heard Amused to Death almost 20 years ago.  The Tuvan recording probably resorts to some of the same sonic trickery the Waters record did, because right now, I can close my eyes and imagine myself being in Tuva or Mongolia. Sounds are coming from everywhere around me, quite sharply placed, and with a scale I'm usually not expecting a pair of near-field monitors to present.

Initial thoughts are that the O2 is a very capable amp, it's definitely an improvement over my iBasso D4. It's impossible for me to say right away, but the O2 seems rather neutral, my Ad2000 seem more alive in every way, though the bass seems to have picked up slightly while the highs seem more extended, matching the absolutely stunning mids. I have a few minor qualms with the JDS version of the O2, but only aesthetic. The music, in comparison to my iBasso D4, seems more alive with better separation. I'm ABing back and forth, which is very easy between the two, and I am positive I will be buying this O2 from JDS instead of sending it back.

I will be testing the O2 for the next 30 days with the following headphones: Audio Technica Ad700, Ad900, Ad2000, Brainwavz HM5, Sennheiser HD558, and Superlux HD668b."	t5_2qmiy	True

1327864287.0	p1y1d	Offer for us to review speakers from Aperion Audio—opinions?	calinet6	32	7	35	"Hi /r/audiophile community!

First, as always, thanks for being awesome. I'm impressed by the handling of questions, reviews, and other topics, and even the occasional troll (ha). I was even gone for 2 weeks and as far as I can tell nothing exploded.

Next, the real reason for this post, I've been contacted by an employee from [Aperion Audio](http://www.aperionaudio.com/) wondering if we'd like to do a ""reddit mod review"" of some of their speakers. ([here's their recent and poorly titled reddit ad thread](http://www.reddit.com/comments/oa6yc/10000_home_theater_system_sound_for_under_2000) if you're interested, or [a recent Stereophile review](http://www.stereophile.com/floorloudspeakers/aperion_audio_intimus_6t_loudspeaker/index.html)).

Of course I want to make sure everyone is comfortable with this, and if there are serious convictions against it, I will absolutely not accept the offer. I understand that this is essentially a marketing effort for a private company and I do have my own reservations. Namely that they'd probably reference my review on their web site possibly in reference to this forum, that it would be taking advantage of my position, and that they're effectively buying a review with the offer, none of which I'm entirely comfortable with.

On the plus side, I think it would be an interesting bit of unique and possibly exclusive content, an opportunity to get more exposure to some brand new upcoming speakers, and possibly the start of other reviews from other brands if the experience is good. I also like that the representative also wants to make sure the community is comfortable and the process appears to be fairly transparent. Of course, I would not be paid and would make every effort to be as unbiased and objective as possible.

He also mentioned that one or two others from the community could participate, if trustworthy (I'm assuming we're basically talking about an 'in home trial' type deal). We'll get to that once (and if) we as a community decide one way or the other on the offer.

I appreciate any and all opinions. Thanks again everyone.

**Update: It's unanimous!** Thanks everyone. I'll move forward with getting the equipment and keep you updated on progress throughout, including of course the final review.

Also I'll start a thread to compile a list of test tunes, as well as a sidebar ""about the mods"" section to describe my experience and equipment more. I'd also love suggestions on ""standard"" equipment, eg: DAC, Preamp, Amplifier that you'd like me to focus on, as I may have the ability to pick them up and ""upgrade"" my setup prior to the review.

I will also let them know that we have several people interested in reviewing the speakers as well, and I will take into account your requests below and PM those of you who were interested with more info. Thanks!

Is anyone else tired of seeing this subreddit filled with ""I have XXX dollars, pick a system for me""

For me, this is not truly discussion worthy of /r/audiophile. I prefer to read about new hardware, reviews, etc. I don't mind the occasional specific question but the constant barrage of posts from people who haven't even tried the search function is getting ridiculous.

I think if a separate subreddit were created to address these kinds of questions, this problem could be solved.

I'd like to introduce tube based gear into my system but a) I'd like to keep the price as close to $1.5k(US) as possible b) would rather not split components into amp, preamp, DAC, etc. Peachtree is attractive but I'm having trouble with the number inputs. Looks like something must move to USB. Also, in my listenening comparisons I do notice increased spatial quality with USB. Questions:

1. The sampling capabilities seem to be the same as optical but USB offers asynchronous. I realize this offers something about timing. Is there other data being passed? Are there specs on this? 

2. Can sources be placed on a USB hub? So with general computer gear one can use a hub to provide additional inputs. Is this possible with something like the Nova125?

3. Anyone using Linux (alsa, mpd, LMS) with USB audio? Do you reroute the audio from the sound card to USB somehow?

And while I usually feel guilty pirating, what I sometimes end up doing is just buying the music on itunes, but then torrenting it anyway since I can sometimes find it lossess or at least a higher quality mp3 than what the itunes store has.

One of the key features will be a database with specifications for almost all speakers available for purchase online.  I want to make sure I don't leave out any key specs before I start populating the database.  So, what specs are most important to you when looking at speakers online?

One spec/feature I was planning on putting a lot of effort into is having a frequency response graph for as many speakers as possible.  Is this as important as I think?  Would this be something that would make you a repeat visitor to a website?

Thank you for any thoughts and feedback.

EDIT:  Wow! even more comments than I expected.  You all have been very helpful.  You can cheer me on or tell me I'm an idiot who will fail (negative + specific = bonus), it all helps.  Thanks again to everyone that has commented.

A little more background - I'm doing this entirely solo currently and only started learning python, sql, html, and css a couple weeks ago, so my sites launch will likely not be for another month or so.  I'm also working a full-time job, so I only get to work on this on nights and weekends.  Additionaly, for any doubters, or dreamers, this is not just a passing thought, I have already created my own (and first) business and secured some domain names (very boring holding pages for now so I don't want to share them yet)."	t5_2qmiy	True
