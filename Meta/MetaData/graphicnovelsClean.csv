RedZeroWolf	46	4	8	"I came across this subreddit and looked over to 'Where Do I Start?', I found some of my favorite ones (Watchmen and Y: The Last Man) but surprisingly Transmet is not among them. Below you'll find a link to information about it and a summary. 

What I myself have to say about this series is the following: Transmetropolitan is somehow filthy and classy. It is the worst curse words and insults you'll ever hear as well as some of the most touching writing you will read in a graphic novel. Transmet is about the truth and the simple fact that truth can be just as beautiful as it can be ugly. I hope some you read it and find it as enjoyable as I did.

At this point I've read most of the quality mainstream stuff and have lost interest in the ongoing, never-ending superhero and sci-fi stories on the shelves. However, while I've gotten tired of the mainstream stories, I still love the medium and I really enjoy reading comic-format literature. Some of the greatest examples of this, in my opinion, are Maus, Fun Home, and A Contract with God.

My cousin is an English teacher in SE Pennsylvania.  In addition to being a hell of a guy (despite being a Flyers fan), he's a pretty progressive teacher who is trying to teach important literature concepts using a medium that his students can relate to - graphic novels.  The work he has chosen for the curriculum is Watchmen.  The only problem he's run into is the budget (or lack of) for his school.  To help fund the lessons, he has turned to the donation site DonorsChoose.org.

To quote [his project on DonorsChoose.org](http://www.donorschoose.org/project/watchmenteaching-the-time-100-lists-on/826373/):

&gt;One of the most significant literary works of the past 25 years is not what you would expect-- it is, for all intents and purposes, a comic book.

&gt;The only graphic novel on Time's 100 All-Time Novels list, Watchmen is an intense study of heroism in an alternate reality of dystopian Cold War America.

&gt;Teaching Watchmen will allow me to engage my students through the growing, but pedagogically underutilized, medium of the graphic novel. Because of the symbolism and themes that Watchmen employs, my students will be able to link it to such classic studies of the hero archetype as Beowulf, Oedipus, and Hamlet, while also analyzing its connections with dystopian literature such as 1984.

&gt;It is obvious that students live in an increasingly visual culture. Engaging them in the reading of Watchmen will allow them to tap into the the arterial immediacy of the present and the intellectual heritage of the past.

He's trying to raise $1,100 to purchase 60 copies of Watchmen for his class.  If you have a few bucks to spare, any donations to this worthy cause would be greatly appreciated.  A link to his donation page is below:

[Watchmen:  Teaching the Time 100 List's Only Graphic Novel Donation Page](http://www.donorschoose.org/project/watchmenteaching-the-time-100-lists-on/826373/)

1366048268.0	1ceh3q	Mysterious Graphic Novel from the 80s. Help!	jaundicey	21	2	10	"I have this vivid memory of a comic book an older kid had in about 1986-87. It was a good sized book with amazing full color, realistic fantasy art. The tone was very dark. 
The pages I remember:

A scene with people trapped in a room. They are trying to get a huge gate open while poison/magic gas is pouring in. People are dying with terrible expressions on their faces.

A scene with a warrior in green armor fighting a massive horde of little goblin things. They are swarming all around him. I remember something about the armor being invincible, but the hero lost the helmet. The goblin things decapitate him. Behind him in the picture is an old man standing protectively in front of his daughters cornered on the edge of an abyss. 

A scene of a towered city at night with a huge flying demon and rider, soaring over the rooftops.

That's all I have to go on. It was very Heavy Metal-ish and blew my fragile 5 year old mind and I've been searching ever since. Also, there may be some unintentional changes in my memory over the years. 

I am an illustrator now, so this may have been the genesis of my career! Is there anyone who knows what this is?"	t5_2qqjj	True

So, I was thinking, maybe it would be cool to read the books/issues with other people and share thoughts along the way or once we've finished. Is there anyone out there who would be interested?
I just got a book called Daytripper based on one of the suggestions. It seems pretty deep, so if anyone is or has already read this, maybe we could start off with that. 

Edit: Count Quackula suggested we read 3 issues/chapters per week and discuss, and then have a larger 
discussion once the entire book/series is finished. Does that work for everyone? When would be good to start?

Edit: Ok, it seems like we've got a few takers, so how about we get this thing started? I think that as a test run we should just start out discussing the entirety of Daytripper, and then if that goes smoothly we can start doing more frequent discussions. Would everyone be able to finish the book in two weeks? If so, we could have our first discussion on March 1st. "	t5_2qqjj	True

I have now read the first two books and while I like the story and the setting I am annoyed by how shallow Yorick as a character is(as of now) and how often times there seems to be a lack of tension or at least a clumsy build-up/breakdown of it.

[For example Marrisville being a prison village has 2 pages of ""DONT TELL ANYONE"" followed by ""I am so sorry I didn't tell you earlier."" which eventually seems to add no inherent value to the story-arc. Even though I find Yorick to be quite transparent, I did not expect such a stupid and naive reaction from him. I don't know what to think of it...](/spoiler)

Is this how the whole series is or will it change? Or if it stays that way, did you feel the same about Yorick and the other characters? Or am I just ""not getting it""?

**Edit:** I don't know many adapters, but as far as female artists, I have a few in mind who might be great:

*Pia Guerra, co-creator and lead penciller of the Y: The Last Man series. An amazing, award-winning work.

*Linda Medley, penciller, inker, and colorist. Probably best known for her work on Castle Waiting, but she's also done work for DC Comics and Image Comics and worked on the Fables series. She seems to draw with a realistic eye and wouldn't blow out the female figure, which would be a big mistake in a project with Tamora Pierce, as she's such a girl-power, women's rights supporter.

*Jill Thompson worked on Neil Gaiman's Sandman series and has since worked for DC Comics, Marvel, Dark Horse, Scholastic, and HarperCollins. She's won a lot of awards and also worked on the Fables series.

*Carla Speed McNeil adapted D.J. MacHale's first Pendragon book, and she has a sci-fi comic series Finder, which has won awards.

I need to make some room in my book shelf, so the following Graphic Novels will go out the door:

* [I Kill Giants (Paperback)](http://www.amazon.com/I-Kill-Giants-Joe-Kelly/dp/1607060922/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376471153&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=I+kill+Giants)

* [Top Ten - Book 02 (Hardcover)](http://www.amazon.com/Top-Ten-Book-02-10/dp/1563899663/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376470844&amp;sr=8-3)

All three are in very good condition (Not to a collector probably, but to the average person): Read once, maybe twice, no visible damages.

I'm posting this here because I figure I'd rather give the books to somebody who values them instead of unloading them at some random second hand bookstore.

One caveat: I'd rather unload all three at once and you would have to make up for the shipping cost from Germany (about $20 to the US). I don't really care for the money, so I'm listening to creative offers.

**EDIT:** All three books are in English

**EDIT2:** Apparently I didn't make my intentions clear enough. I *don't want* the $20 for shipping. Just give me something back that makes sending out the books for free worthwile. Something that is not money. If you can draw, draw me a nice picture. If you do charity work, read the books out loud to homeless kids. If your sister happens to be Katy Perry, set me up for a date with her. Whatever. Best idea wins.

This list is a work in progress and as I read more (or think of older works I may have forgotten), I'll continue adding to the list.

I wrote a paper for college a year or two back dealing with the way traumatic experiences are represented within graphic novels.  Basically, the idea is that text alone as a means of telling a story cannot represent what a trauma victim goes through - be it war, rape, death, concentration camp - but the way that comics function inherently allows for this representation, and thus a better understanding of the victim, as well as the event. [Here](http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v5_1/blake/) is a great article talking about how this works within Watchmen.  

I've been meaning to explore this idea further, but didn't really know how to go about finding more graphic novels in this vein.  Then, low and behold, I discovered you guys!

I had proposed an experimental dissertation to study whether students perform higher on reading assessments when they study a graphic version of Shakespearian texts that utilize the original language versus using the original text alone. However, my class sizes are too small to really allow for sample sizes large enough to yield any results.
  
Now I'm trying to decide on a research-based dissertation on graphic novels (one that would not include an actual experiment).
  
Here are some ideas I was throwing around:
  
Which types of leadership do graphic novels teach most predominantly? Does this differ between eastern and western graphic novels?
 
Do eastern and western graphic novels present protagonists differently? How are the protagonists related to eastern western culture and education?
 
Is there a homogeneity of leadership presented in eastern and western graphic novels?

* The drawing style is the same in super man comics of that era. Very good attention to details and everything is drawn to scale. Humans are beautifully drawn.

* There's very super hot women in the story.

* I'm sure it was a Canadian book.

So I picked up Vol 1, and I couldn't put it down.  It was fantastic!

The mixture of Comedy, Large Scale, and solid writing/artwork made for a top notch story.

Of course after reading like 30-40 pages, I had to hop back on my computer and order a ton more of the volumes.

Are there any others out there with a similar idea (it doesn't have to have a story line along ""god"" or religion for that matter).  I am looking for something genuinely funny, sitting on the line form pushing it too far.

1347851301.0	100659	I enjoy the stories, but why buy them (honest question)?  Please read to understand and answer before downvoting.	untildeath	11	3	14	"So, I just started reading graphic novels (intermixed with my books) and enjoy the storylines.  So far, I've read The Killing Joke (wonderful joker monologue), Hulk versus Wolverine, and I'm about halfway through Identity Wars (pretty good story and I see why people love Deadpool).  

However, as much as I enjoy them, I don't see myself paying $20 or more for a story that is basically 2-10 pages of text.  I don't see myself reading and rereading The Killing Joke (though I enjoyed it).  So, why do you buy them?  Is it for the artwork?  Also, did I just happen to pick short graphic novels and others are far more substantial?  I'd be willing to pay more than $20 even if the story is lengthier.

I like holding onto books, and I'll often put them down for a while when reading them, so libraries are something I'd like to not have to resort to. Additionally, I don't think any local libraries have large selections or much in good condition.

As for content, I'm pretty open. Although I've never been too attracted to classic-style superheroes.

1342823379.0	wwazi	Graphic Novel based dissertation help	thesocialaquaman	7	0	16	"Hi, I'm currently a student studying Illustration for Graphic Novels and have come to the inevitable task of writing my dissertation. I have chosen the title: Is it possible to produce a successful movie adaption of a graphic novel that stays true to the original?
I'd like to cover aspects such as different target audiences, story pacing (text per panel) and most specifically the relationship between the writing process and the concept of a film in the writers mind, two contrasts being Kick-Ass and the Watchmen. 
I was wondering if anyone knows of any source materials that would help me within the research phase for any of these aspects or great examples of graphic novels or their writers who stand either for or against the potential of movie adaptions.
Any help would be greatly appreciated as I believe you guys have such an amazing knowledge which would benefit me tons.

EDIT: I think I've confused people so just to be clear, the title is a question at this point because that is what my tutors have told us to do, we are yet to form conclusions so maybe we will put a proper title in place then once we have decided on a statement to make in favour of our findings.. Also it's a question at the moment with no one side taken because we have to explore both sides equally, however the conclusion will form my answer to the question posed so I will take a side.

Many teachers and scholars believe that graphic novels are an ideal way to reach students, as even the least prepared reader can ‘read’ comics or graphic novels and become engaged in the text. Here are a few questions I have about the use of comics in the classroom:

 *   How do comics/graphic novels function as accessible yet complex works of art?

 *   How might they be used in the classroom/what could they help you teach?

 *   What would you want students to see and understand about a particular text?

 *   Why else might comics/graphic novels become an important component of the curriculum in its own right?

I just finished taking a graphic novels course at my university and it made me very interested in this form of writing. One of the main discussions in this class was how this form of literature could be used in the classroom and I would like some more discussion on this topic.

I've just released the completed the 40-page chapter 1 as a PDF, which can be downloaded via my website. The hope is that this sample will leave you wanting more, because I've also launched my new [Kickstarter Project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/537953988/the-lightstream-chronicles-graphic-novel). The funds made by the kickstarter will go towards completing the book in a timely manner and its initial printing run.

The first 40 pages contain 99 high resolution renderings that will easily exceed your computer's native resolution, meaning you'll be able to zoom in extensively to inspect the finest of details. This is the first of six chapters that should come to roughly 240 pages before it's over. 

I'm a seasoned designer with years of professional experience, but I left the corporate world in 2010 to pursue and MFA at The Ohio State University in Design Development where I am currently a Graduate Teaching Associate.

**Plot Introduction:**
*The Lightstream Chronicles is a science-fiction, crime drama set in the year 2159. There is a single global government structure, New Asia. The setting is Hong Kong 2, a mega-city with 51 million people that serves as the global capital. Technologically and genetically enhanced humans, synthetic humans, and replicated humans thrive -- as does crime. There are two worlds: TopCity, the upper floors of the metropolis where sunlight reaches and wealth abounds, and DownTown, the bottom of society.*

*It is in the darkness of DownTown that a renowned scientific prodigy, Dr. Sean Colbert, chief designer of some of the most sophisticated and commercially successful synthetic humans, is brutally assaulted and left for dead. The high-profile crime is given top priority and in the rush to find those responsible and administer justice, Chief Science Officer Kristin Broulliard, her right-hand ""synthetic"" Toei-N, and human detective Jack Guren are left will little choice but to enlist the help of the newest, ultra-sophisticated police detective, a T-Class synthetic, named Keiji-T. This new synthetic, designed and programmed by Sean Colbert himself, has proven capable of determining guilt with upwards of 99 percent accuracy and is the first synthetic ever to be authorized to harm a human. As the clock ticks, it appears that not everyone wants Keiji to succeed.*"	t5_2qqjj	True

If you committed to a serialized graphic story, what do you think you would pay?  How often would you be expecting new content to keep you interested?

**Edit: It would seem people who have tried it, like reading comics on their phones/tablets.  I get the general impression that many people just haven't tried it yet, thus making me think this is a whole new avenue for comics, comics readers, and future comics readers.**  

My Take: Comics seem to still have a lot of ground to cover as being a viable medium of art (in the United States), despite artists like Chris Ware winning the National Book Award.  Perhaps with portable readers, people will get over the stigma once associated with reading comics and give something new a try.  "	t5_2qqjj	True

My name is Marcus Ako.  I am a Writer/Director/Producer/Actor.  I started off as an Actor based in the UK, and found quickly there wasn't much work for a mixed-raced, US-accented male actor here.  This is why there is a talent exodus to the US (Idris Elba, Lennie James, Colin Salmon etc).  But having a wife and 2 kids tends to keep you rooted, so I started writing, producing, and directing my own material, which has fulfilled me in many more ways than if I had stuck to acting. I have done a number of short films, and while my first feature film is in development, I dove into another passion of mine: Graphic novels.  I found it was an excellent way of getting all the twisted, graphic, horror stories out of my head and into the world without the torture of film pre-production.  And here is my first project.

Culliver City is a crime noir graphic novel in a similar vein to Criminal by Ed Brubaker or Sin City by Frank Miller. In each volume / story arc in the series, we follow one lead who becomes entangled in the criminal underbelly of the city, with numerous regular characters weaving in and out of the story. The first volume is CALL 1-800-KILLAGUY, a three-issue immersion into the hit-man marketplace in Culliver City.  It follows Jake Alexander, a charming younger bartender who has an affair with an old gangster's trophy wife, which causes a chain reaction that leads to 5 of the deadliest Hitmen in the city stumbling over each other to retrieve his head in 48 hours.

In order to be able to launch CALL 1-800-KILLAGUY, i need to raise £2000 for printing and paying the artist to be able to launch in May.  I have launched a Kickstarter page 
http://kck.st/WZiy1n and have so far raised £549 with 6 days to go. If I can't raise the remaining £1451 before the 1st of April, I lose what I have already raised. 

I am throwing myself at your generousity and benevolence; please help me reach my goal. Please go to my Kickstarter page http://kck.st/WZiy1n and donate generously. And after you are done, please tell your friends to do the same.  I have some wonderful perks for those willing to donate, and I will load up some of the artwork from the novel on this site later on today. You can see all the images on the Kickstarter site as well.

Please help me reach this target. £1451 in 6 days. It is an attainable goal, I just need help to get there. Please help me.

Thank you for your time.

As I recall(and some of these details may be incorrect due to faulty memory), it was a teen angst/young adult graphic novel about a boy who goes to some kind of christian youth retreat and there meets a girl.  The two begin a relationship.  I remember him talking about how he more or less skipped a semester in school to stay with her and her family, and that she made him a quilt as a symbol of their love at some point.  I also remember that the two break up at some point.  If I am correct, it ends with the main character, years later, going through his closet and finding the quilt, waxing nostalgic at his early relationship.

I haven't got around to the actual drawing of the comic... Since I obviously need a story to draw about... Otherwise I'd be drawing for no reason and making up the story as I go.

So here's my idea: 

**Batman Plot Idea**

Two homeless men are seen standing around a burning trash can in an alleyway. They're talking about the Batman, sharing random stories, myths, and legends about him. (Sort of similar to the stories in ""Have I Got a Story for You"" in the Gotham Knight series.)

Suddenly, a blinding light shoots past them. (Frame shows the exterior of batmobile with a ray of light behind it).

Story cuts to batman inside batmobile talking to Alfred. Alfred informs about an increasingly infamous gang lord. (Later it turns out this drug lord is Black Mask). Every other panel shows batmobile going from an alleyway into a subway, and switches to either batman inside batmobile or Alfred in the bat cave.

Next page shows a small child on the train tracks in an abandoned underground subway. Panels will switch from each side of the boys face. One side will show a distant light in the background. The other side will show the boys face brighten up increasingly [in terms of lighting]. 

I will show the batmobile stop right as its about the child. batman gets out of the batmobile. Batman tells the boy to get out. 

Next frame will show several pairs of red eyes emerging from the darkness [signature of Black Mask].

Batman squints his eyes, as he looks at the eyes.

  I'm not really sure if it's worth buying a few more copies. 

  So, anyone familiar with this series and do you recommend buying it?

  Side note: Honestly, for some reason I thought this was written by a woman and after getting half way through, I realized it's a man (Alan, duh, I was too excited to start reading to pay attention to author) and so far Tank Girl as a character just seems like she was written from a male perspective. Nothing *wrong* with that, I just don't prefer it - female characters written by men are common to be less complex than I like.
  Anyway, I'd like advice because We Hate Tank Girl is just a taste and if Tank Girl is complex and badass as I hope, I would love to divulge in this series. "	t5_2qqjj	True

Started around last fall, have the outline done, basically drawing and writing the script on my own. Completed about 30 pages so far, I think I'm aiming for a 200+ page venture.



It's a scifi/war/adventure/drama with a pinch of good dark humor. Set in an alternate world, where Soviets makes an attempt to invade the world, and belligerent gods come appear with spaceships -- and aren't much different than the rest of them. It spans from the 80s to 2050s.



Aside from your beautiful opinions, I also need advice for propagation. How/where to publish, aside 
from graphicly -- how else should i go forward with my work, so, you know -- i can quit my day job and focus on completion?



Should I ask money in kickstart -- to have money for a website? Submit it to publishers? Expose my genitals for much needed exposure?


I basically just started drawing-writing, and didn't study up on the current market, for that I am a noob.


Any feedback (criticism or otherwise) is so much needed. Thank you."	t5_2qqjj	True

The only local place that buys used comics has offered $2 each and kind of reminded me of the pawn stars guy. My husband invested quite a bit into these when they came out, and has kept them in very good condition so we were hoping to get at least $5.

1) I don't read comics, only trades or graphic novels.

2) Where this strays from 1); I started in the sequential art world with 2000AD and re-entered some years later with Freak Bros/Fat Freddy's Cat.

I have read and enjoyed a vast range of titles, including Marvel.

There have only been three collections that I have chucked back unfinished.

* Essential Silver Surfer; Vol 1 - Stan Lee
* Daredevil: Visionaries - Frank Miller
* Paradise X - Kreuger, Ross, Braithwaite.

I dig Hyperion, I love Punisher but couldn't abide any of the above.

* Silver Surfer - stupid stilted dialogue felt like it was aimed at ten year-olds.
* Daredevil - the graphics were so truly awful that I didn't read past the first few pages.
* Paradise X - I don't know the Marvel universe, I freely admit. Ben's kids? Mar-Vell? It smacked of desperation. OK, I found Hyperion and Frank in there, still shit.

I know you guys get a real hard-on for Dead Pool, but Paradise X made me think he's a twat.

I'm hoping this is the right place to post this. I am a music producer who goes by badtouch, and I did the music for this project created by a talented emcee who goes by Sum. The Nobody Hole can be considered a Hip Hopera of sorts, but it's so different from a typical rap project that I think posting it in a hip hop subreddit will be a bad idea with the average listener there having the attention span of a fortune cookie. 

The story is a simple and timeless one, where the main character falls into a strange world and has to fulfill his unknown destiny in order to return home. It's really the deft way it's told that makes it worth the time. Every track has lyrics, artist commentary, and original artwork from some talented artists, including an up-and-comer names Jared Rogness. It runs for EXACTLY one hour, and really needs to be listened to in its entirety and with the attention that any graphic novel deserves. 

I know it's asking a lot to give an hour of your life to a project that is probably pretty lame, but I'm pretty sure that you will be glad that you did.

(tl;dr - namedropping, recommend intellectual &amp; artsy scifi)

I don't seem to be able to find new graphic novels to read which would hit my nerve and I wonder if you could you recommend something fitting the description. 

I love everything by Enki Bilal for both writing and the astonishing paintings, Luther Arkwrights by Talbot are unsurpassed in storytelling and depth, I worship the minimalistic, architectural style of Möbius and recently I've been enjoy the scifi-epics of Incal by Jorodowsky. If you know these, could you recommend anything that would fit the continuum? 

It is a delight when the novels have more text than less and the quality of art aims to be top-notch. While I've never fancied superheroes, the Sandman, Watchmen and the Black orchid are wondrous - Moore and Mckean are a geniouses. 

Basically what I'm after are twofold, either visual celebration of imagination painted/drawn in realism-leaning style - in spirit of Moebius or, say Little Nemo in Slumberland - imaginative worlds, societies and oddities not going only for grotesque.  

Or/and massive, deep, complicated storylines that don't explain too much or explain too much (Bilal). Stories of societies and large-scale conflicts - like entwinedness Luther Arkwright, epic scale of Nausicaa of the Valley of the wind, mature scifi of Halo Jones or historical esseyness of Alix. Also, there must be more experimenting with the format like the Æon Flux: The Herodotus File, but I haven't found a single other novel that would have tried anything similar. 

That was namedropping, but those are the best novels I've read, and it is hard to find new mature scifi/fantasy that is at same time aestethically high-aiming and not too shallow (Sillage/wake), cartoony, superheroy (Gaimans Eterenals), cliche-manga (first psicyber-godteen was interesting, 5th not so much) or action/violence oriented (sincity, hard-boiled - while stunning, the stories are just machismo). 

I'm going to Paris next month, and while there is a language barrier, I'm eager to check if you know to recommend any untranslated pearls. 

What are the most imaginative, experimental, deep or visually stunning graphic novels that you've read recently? 
Do you know any website that reviews that latest French graphic Novels?

1348085308.0	105j0o	N.I.C.E this weekend! Featuring Charlie Adlard, Alan Davis, Jamie Delano, Marko Djurdjevic, Esad Ribic and many more! PLUS Guest starring Alan Moore, creator of Watchmen, V for Vendetta and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen!!	Bakersfield_Mark_II	2	0	3	"Exciting times!

This weekend (Saturday 22nd - Sunday 23rd September), the manager of my local comic shop Close Encounters in Northampton is putting on a new and especially interesting convention, hosted within a theme park! 

Northants International Comics Expo: http://www.northantsinternationalcomicsexpo.com/index.php will be hosted at Wicksteed Park http://www.wicksteedpark.co.uk/ a small, family friendly park based just outside of Northampton. 

The guest list is phenomenal, I've been to a number of shows and have never seen one with this amount of artists and writers, frankly I don't know how he wangled it! On top of that to have it set in a theme park is a brilliant idea (I'm surprised no one has thought of it before). 

In addition to the usual (i.e Signings/ sketches/ panels) which can only be accessed by those with tickets, there is a trading area, art gallery, and cosplay section which are all free to enter. This will probably be a great relief to those of us who just want to have a mosey for those key issues we are missing, or families who just want something to do with the kids on a weekend. 

All autographs from the attending guests will be FREE of charge, some will be doing headshots for free too, although I'm not sure which guests will be operating this very generous policy... either way this is good news as one of my pet peeves is paying through the nose to travel to and attend a convention, only to then have to fork over another £10-£20 per signature or tiny sketch! 

MORE IMPORTANTLY HOWEVER!! Alan Moore will be attending! O__O 

I'm totally gobsmacked. Mr Moore has allegedly not attended a comic convention in over 20 YEARS! On the Saturday evening he will be doing an hour long talk on how to write comic books, followed by a Q&amp;A session, so those of you who have read and loved his work, and would like to improve your own writing skills this is a ridiculous and potentially one-off opportunity. Access to Mr Moore's panel is gained through an interesting (and very worthy) method of donating your old graphic novels/ TPBs at the convention, which will go to the local library, a cause in which Alan takes a great interest in. These donations will be matched by Diamond (the UKs comic distributor).

I will be dragging all of my comic reading friends this weekend, and you should too! This would also be a great day out if you have children who are interested in comics, because you can buy something and then go and play on the rides :D 

Now for the human interest part: 
Jeff (who is putting this on), is a ridiculously nice guy. He runs one of two branches of a family-run comic shop, and takes a great interest in his local community. Without fail every time I go into the store I will be offered a cup of tea, some banter, and even occasionally some lunch!! I know that putting on this convention has been his dream for many years, and he has done so well to get this far, however for this to be a success he needs to sell tickets and for this show to be as amazing as it can be. As such I humbly implore anyone who can make it this weekend to turn up, attend something unique that is punching above its weight, and support the under-dog for once instead of the flashy London cons which pocket all your money before you've even entered the door, put nothing back into society, and treat their guests like crap. If nothing else it will stop him from having a stress-induced heart attack.

Thank you for reading, and I really hope to see you there!

- Lorna :)

2 - ask reddit where to post a link to the site that has the first 2-3 volumes free - basically what sites should i broadcast the thing on?

3 - make a booth at local cons like dragon-con, even the anime ones, giving away printed copies of the first 2-3 free volumes. also give people places close to them where they can buy the graphic novel. 

4 - i never got to a 4th idea...

* Zombie/Vampires - check
* Robot - check
* Post-apocalyptic nightmare scenario - check
* Elephant - check
* Beautifully drawn - check

If you haven't read it, I suggest picking it up, particularly if you like the subject matter, but will appeal, as the review suggests, to a wide audience, it's pretty kid-friendly.

If you have read it, does anyone know if there were further volumes as nothing has come to light so far?

By self-contained I mean a single book gives you the complete experience. I was thinking about The Walking Dead, but then I found out that the comic series is on its 10th year anniversary, with no end in sight. So, I guess its not for me.

1368625366.0	1edqvv	I'm co-hosting a panel discussion next week with guests from Comixology, reMINDblog, and Fantagraphics. Looking for questions from you, details inside.	Captain_Kittenface	2	2	6	"Hey all, I'm co-hosting a google+ hangout next week on indie comic book marketing. We want to structure the hangout as a sort of AMA where myself and two others will be dishing out questions to the panelists.

You can ask general questions or things specific to a particular panelist. The topic is marketing techniques to help your comic survive, gain an audience, make money, etc.

I would love to give credit where credit is due! I'll default to your username but feel free to add your website or real name for us if you'd like. We have an hour with these fine folks so I can't guarantee that we would get to all your questions but we'll do our best to hit as many as possible!

Details on the panelists:

**Chikle** [elchikle.com](http://www.elchikle.com/1979.html) - An underground artist and legend around San Diego, Chikle has created much success through creating hand printed art out his garage and distributing it in a very ""DIY"" kind of way. His specialty is the fact the he is the only panelist that has a large fan base that is almost completely created through tangible items that he self produces.

**Jen Vaughn** - Writer for Comics Beat &amp; Public Relations for [Fantagraphics](http://www.fantagraphics.com/). In the indie printing industry there is no bigger name that Fantagraphics, and Jen is on our panel to specialize in how the print publishing industry looks at marketing and how that effects comic startups.

**Chip Mosher** - Head of PR for [comixology](http://www.comixology.com/) and longtime guru of comic book marketing will serve as an expert on all levels of marketing, including how digital is changing the make up of comic marketing and what comic marketing MEANS for digital.

**Jason Brubaker** - Artist of [reMINDblog](http://www.remindblog.com/) which has one of the most successful comic book kickstarter campaigns to date will be there to talk about how creator owned work can defy the odds and be itself at the same time.

1344722666.0	y2dl7	Found: Abraxas and the Earthman, by Rick Veitch. 	thoughtsy	3	3	0	"I'd been asking for a link [the other day](http://www.reddit.com/r/graphicnovels/comments/y0zps/request_abraxas_and_the_earthman_by_rick_veitch/) and I found one. 

In a bid to [continue to raise public awareness](http://www.rickveitch.com/2012/02/27/the-abraxas-groundswell-continues/) of this amazing work, I'm posting it here. We all know things feel better, erm, in the flesh, so to speak, so I encourage you to [head to his site and buy a copy](http://www.rickveitch.com/the-king-hell-bookstore/). 

""*This first collected edition of the seminal graphic novel published in serial form during the early 1980s brings a powerful psychedelic journey into print. Veitch (The Maximortal; Can’t Get No) astounds with a heartfelt tale that is equal parts Herman Melville, consciousness expansion, environmental treatise and gripping sci-fi adventure replete with space battles and all manner of exotic extraterrestrials. The story follows cetologist John Isaac, who is shanghaied from a naval research mission, along with the submarine’s commanding officer. The pair is thrust into the thick of mad Captain Rotwang’s interstellar vendetta against Abraxas, a space-faring crimson leviathan who cost the captain his leg and, arguably, much of his sanity. As both earthmen are put through horrific physical alterations, Isaac discovers to his shock — and dawning fascination — that he may be the nexus between humanity and a great cosmic truth of staggering proportions. A lush and thought-proving narrative is seamlessly expressed through a script that veers between extremes of wide-eyed wonder and outright horror. The febrile illustrations disgust — Isaac loses his skin early on — without losing the essential humanity of this powerful tale.*""

There is a madly possessed space captain in pursuit of a giant red whale (very Moby Dick). I have vague memories of small planets composed entirely of trees, and praying mantis-like surgeons who transform creatures from one form to another. Literate, ecological, and mind-expanding, all rolled into one. I had the original Epic magazines in which the series premiered, which were destroyed by fire... so I feel quite justified in asking for a digital copy. I've already bought them once. 

If anybody has a link, I'd appreciate the share. If not... it's a fine read, you should do just that, if you get a chance. "	t5_2qqjj	True

I would really appreciate some suggestions!

Preferably ones that are also in physical print

not interested in mangas :p

The ones I am familiar with and enjoy so far are series like the MSPA comics, Scott Pilgrim, Whistles, the comic version of Adventure Time, etc.
