I didn't include extreme error coins like blank planchet, off-center strike, etc. because I feel like these are more visibly noticeable. If I left out something that you think should be on the list please comment and I'll add it. Since I live in the U.S. and close to the border I only come across these two countries regularly, however if anyone else from another country would like to add their pocket change rarities in the comments by all means do so. I think that's all... edits to come I'm sure.

It's being returned tomorrow to its rightful owner.	spsiamese	47	3	16	"When I was at work Saturday, we received a phone call from an elderly woman explaining that she had been in the hospital for the past month and a half, and sometime during this, her grandchildren had stolen her old coins and spent them. She said they had talked to the police for over an hour, but weren't able to find out where they spent them all. After that they admitted to spending some at the store I work at, as well as traded them with some of their friends (which is who I'm assuming the boy who spent the one I got was). One of my Co workers remembers getting a couple, but she did not purchase them from the register, and the manager that was there is currently on vacation so we have no idea where those went at the moment. 

Since I have one of her coins, I will be getting in contact with her tomorrow to return it. I wish her luck in retrieving any of her other ones, but I'm pretty pessimistic about it because when the same thing happened to me I wasn't able to get any returned. 

I just thought I would update everyone here because I had posted about it originally. "	t5_2qhuq	True

I'm a professional numismatist with a major auction house (which I will not name publicly as this is not endorsed by them), and have conducted business professionally with other redditors to their great benefit!  I see thousands of rare and valuable coins and pieces of paper money every week.  

Before you go asking away, please know that my areas of expertise are in US coins, an emphasis on toned coins, errors, and small cents; though I'm well versed in US coins and grading.  

I'll be happy to answer whatever questions I can, but please keep it civil.  Additionally, since this is a slower-moving subreddit, I will leave this AMA open for a week or so until everyone's had their chance to ask their questions.  I do ask that you don't flood the thread with ID or value questions, though I'm happy to answer them as well.

---

Update 8/22 11PM PST  :

WOW!  Some great questions.  I'll continue answering them as I can for the rest of the week.  I hope that you're all getting some insight on what the professional side of the hobby looks like.  If I haven't gotten to your question yet, it's probably because I had to think on it, or because it would have taken longer than I had while I was answering for that period, which is often when I take a few minutes break between games of LOL or at work off my phone--I'll get to them...I promise!"	t5_2qhuq	True

The credibility of reddit.com took a pretty big hit in the eyes of the public recently, when the amateur detectives of reddit started accusing innocent people - by name - of terrorist acts in the city of Boston. When the dust settled people who didn't know anything else about reddit were saying that redditors had no business playing detective, and that they should leave those matters to paid professionals.

I don't entirely agree. Crowdsourcing has been shown to work well in many situations, and /r/Coins is proof of that. People come here and ask questions, and we usually do our best to answer them. We actually do have a few numismatic professionals who participate here, as well as some very well-read and experienced amateurs.

Sometimes we get things wrong, but many of us are resourceful enough to find the answers that people are looking for even if we can't give them off the top of our heads. Lately though, along with an influx of new participants there seems to be a rash of very confident though equally incorrect replies.

There have also been a few people who have a proven track record of providing accurate information who have lately been giving some fairly glib and almost disdainful replies. I've also recently been witness to an increase in disrespectful comments and extended bickering, which is nothing new to the Internet but is fairly unusual here.

Folks, we need to nip this trend in the bud. Please. This subreddit has always expected civility from and toward its members. That expectation has been posted in the sidebar for a long time. 

This is a moderated forum, and it is a place where people come for help in the form of information. It's not a democracy. Just because something gets a lot of upvotes doesn't mean that it belongs here. The moderators will continue to delete submissions and comments that we deem inappropriate.

I want people to have fun here and feel a sense of camaraderie and shared passion for our hobby, but I'd appreciate it if we'd all remember to be respectful and make sure that our replies to people's questions are as accurate and helpful as possible.

**TL;DR**

Most of our members here are wonderful - both knowledgeable and respectful in their comments. I am fortunate to work with a fantastic moderation team, people who labor to make this a friendly and informative place. I really feel that /r/Coins is one of the best subreddits around, and I'm grateful to everyone who helps make it that way.

Thanks to you all for your friendly and helpful contributions."	t5_2qhuq	True

I think I can build a free tool for collection management that’s better than what currently exists, but I’m trying to decide if it would be worth my time to do so (I don’t want to spend a few months building something that only I would use).

My girlfriend (she’s a programmer too) and I put together a short video of what I’d like to build. The video is at 43copper.com and http://vimeo.com/62449890. I’m interested in finding out whether or not a free, full-featured coin management system would be something people would use, and also what features would be the most important to build into it.

Any feedback, thoughts, ideas, and advice would be appreciated. If it seems like there’s enough interest in the idea (based on feedback here on reddit, conversations with collectors I’ve been reaching out to, and people signing up for an email list at 43copper.com), I’ll get to work.

Thanks so much,

Jack"	t5_2qhuq	True

Heres a little more background, this chest of coins used to belong to my  grandpa. When I was little (9) he would work at the flea market and I would help. There was a stand where these people would sell coins and whatever money I made from helping my grandpa I would go over and use to buy coins. The people who owned the stand were extremely nice and would give me my change in buffalo nickles, mercury dimes, etc.. Well my grandpa was a big coin collector already and is the one who got me into it. Fast forward a couple years, My grandpa (who was only my grandpa from marriage not blood) decided to pick up and leave one day to go to the Philippines. He didn't say goodbye to me (12) or anyone in my family, He took everything he owned except for this chest of coins which my grandma decided to give me when I turned 16. But I stopped collecting coins once he left. So fast forward some more, I'm about to turn 21 and I decided to finally go through that chest and maybe get back into coin collecting, I wanted to share going through it with someone so I figured this would be something r/coins would like. I know you can't see much in these pictures, its because I took them last night and haven't gone through anything yet. I was thinking of making a video of me going through them or just taking a lot of pictures, Its up to you guys because I can do either or.

1370752330.0	1fysoc	Coin thieves go to the special hell.	jedichefsean	33	2	14	"Several months ago i put together small coin collecting club for a few younglings. it started out with my brother in law's two boys and a couple of their friends from scouts. it soon grew to a regular group of 8-12 boys and girls aged 7-13. the deal is parents pay $20 per kid and that gets them coin folders for all the lincoln cents, merc and rosie dimes, jefferson nicks, and washington quarters. what the parents don't know is that i end up paying about $10 per kid as the 20 they pay only covers about 7 folders and they end up with 15. and at each meet up each of them gets 2-5 rolls of pennies and 2 rolls of nickels. which i also pay for (again, parents don't know this) Anything larger than nickels, the kids can bring in cash or coin and just buy face value rolls from me. Parents are encouraged to send a baggie of change with their kid to each meet up so they can swap amongst themselves and they usually do. The kids are asked to return any of the cents and nickels they don't need to fill their folders, they can keep any that they like, (if they find varieties or just something ""cool"") i usually get about $13 per cent box back and about $80 per nickel box. for next weeks meet up, i was going to give them all a special treat since i would be gone for two weeks in july for comic con (san diego) and we weren't going to have a meet up for that month. the treat was i pulled a small portion of my wheat cent horde and was going to throw (not literally) each kid of pile of wheats, i pulled about 500 wheats. i also had pulled enough war nickels to give 5 to each of them. it was to be my special thank you to them for showing up twice a month and for helping me share my favorite hobby. so here's where the story takes its ""fun"" turn. and by fun, i mean shitty. i put all the coins into tubes and the tubes into a small box. i had gone down to the lobby of my apartment where we have a large common area room adjacent to the manager's office. no one ever hangs out there. i had to go to the manager's office to pick up a package. she wasn't there but would return in 5 minutes according to the plastic clock suction cupped to the door. i waited. she showed up on time and i went in. i left my stuff, iphone, jacket, keys and box with coins (i was taking them to my brother in law's house) since that's where the meet up going to be tomorrow and i have errands to run tomorrow before the meet up and didn't want to drag the coins around town with me. i was in the office long enough to ask for my package, sign for it and remark on the weather. i came out of the office and walked about 25 feet to the counter where my stuff was. my iphone was there, my jacket was there, my keys were there. the box was gone. completely gone. there are 3 ways into the common room, one of which is right past the office. no one walked past. that leaves the front main door which is large and loud. no one walked in through there. the only other way in is from the opposite wing where only residents have access. and of course there are no cameras in the room. so basically some piece of shit walked in, snatched an old, unmarked box on a whim and walked back out. their haul for the little snatch and grab was about $8, face value of course. so now i'm scrambling to put together another fun pile of wheats and war nickels but it looks like i'll have to start popping a few out of 2x2s to make anything worth the hype...people suck. 

tl:dr, some asshole who lives in my building stole a handful of change destined for some nice kids."	t5_2qhuq	True

People, don't let the same thing happen to you.

I don't know yet if I am going to even try to start the collection all over. It feels like a mini version of one's life work going down the drain, like if I had just constructed a beautiful mansion and a tornado came and destroyed it.

I've been asking friends and family for donations of interesting coins, but most people had already given me what they had.

All I am left with is fourteen 200-400 AD Roman coins of which only one has enough detail to even identify.

Fuck. It sucks. I don't know what more to type, I just had to tell some people who would understand. **None** of my friends share, or even understand my passion for coins. But I know you do, and I know you will feel sorry for me. And that is all I have right now."	t5_2qhuq	True

Have fun!

UPDATE: Going to sleep now, got tonnes of guesses so far! Keep them coming :) BTW - Im not going to respond to you asking if you got the coin right so just submit a guess :) and keep guessing :) Upvote this post for others to see it so they get  a fair chance !


UPDATE2: 2 people have actually found the coin now, out of about a hundred guesses wow :). Giving 4 hours from now to see if anyone can come closer on a date than the date already given as a guess - which is very accurate indeed.  As a hint- those wreaths aren't very close to the rim of the coin are they?

FINAL UPDATE: Congrats to /u/mijnpaispiloot! The first of two people to correctly guess British Guiana 4 Pence. They guessed 1921 as the date which was closer than /u/sneeze_and_fart 's 1940's. Will PM for receiving address. http://i.imgur.com/hnvS0zf.jpg

Hope you all learned something while looking and enjoyed it. Ill setup some more in due time  just keep an eye out! (Maybe tomorrow but we will see, otherwise Monday)

[xpost/history]	mamjjasond	31	7	8	"Several years ago, my dad bought a book from a second hand shop which had a couple of letter on each page circled. When they were written out, they gave directions to a location in the Wicklow mountains in Ireland, which conveniently are an hours drive south of where I live. So one weekend we decided to follow the directions to see where they went and if whatever had been buried was still there. So after a day of trapesing across valleys and streams (it was sunny at least), we got lucky and found a small wooden box buried under a rock right where the note said it would be. Inside the box we found a number of coins, mostly from Britain around the turn of the century and a Franz Josef medal from 1849. Was a pretty cool experience all in all.

tl:dr: Followed directions in book to buried treasure in the mountains. I suck at writeups.

1357598894.0	165a75	Thank you, r/coins, for refueling my passion for this hobby.	Barbados25	22	2	12	"I have been interested in coins ever since my grandfather brought me back a 25 cent coin from Barbados when I was about 4 years old. Ever since, my relatives who traveled a lot would always bring me back some coins and\or paper money from wherever they had been (so much better than the ""I &lt;3 Paris"" type souvenirs my other siblings would receive haha). Over the years I have amassed a decent collection of foreign money and a bit of old US currency as well. However, as the years passed, I never once had a friend who shared my interest in coin collecting, and slowly the passion began to dwindle. I picked up coins here and there over the years, and never stopped checking my change, but for the most part the passion I once had was gone. Then, about a month ago, a fellow redditor showed me a cool coin he got in his change, and when I expressed interest he asked me if I had ever been over to r/coins. I had no idea such a subreddit existed, though I had never thought to look. All of a sudden here was an entire community where one could discuss coins, show off recent purchases/finds, share info, etc. I was instantly hooked. In this past month I have learned more about coins than I ever have. The passion is back in full force, and I'm loving it. Thanks for being an awesome community, and bringing back a childhood sense of wonder and excitement I thought I had lost for good.  
  
[Here is a pic of my collection so far](http://i.imgur.com/nH5vg.jpg). I definitely need to start finding a better way to store them haha."	t5_2qhuq	True
1357520687.0	163a9q	Hello from a new collector!	Whizb4ng	22	0	21	"I have been lurking in this subreddit for the better part of 4+ months or so and have made the decision to start collecting coins. I have been fascinated by coins for many years and am looking forward to starting this new hobby. I am most interested in ancient's (I have a B.A. in Classical History if that helps paint the picture) but generally love all coins. 

While the beginning of my collection is humble at best (I currently have 8 coins) I figured I have to start somewhere and slowly build it up. The final push (or sign as it were) to get me to start a coin collection was New Year's Day when I found a Wheatie in my change (which was strange since I am Canadian and was 7 hours north of the border at the time).

With that I present to you my first three coins http://imgur.com/BYD7I

I really enjoy the Canadian Centennial Penny with the dove it is a pleasant change to the maple leaves. The middle is the aformentioned wheat penny (1948 S). It isn't in the greatest condition but it will do. And finally it is just a standard 1962 Canadian penny I just really enjoy the portrait of the youthful Queen on this penny. My other coins come from counties I have visited, Iceland and Ecuador. The Icelandic Coins are neat with all of the fish.

If any of you has advice for a rookie collector and if anyone has a recommendation for a good beginners book for numistics (A Numismatics for Dummies essentially) please let me know!

I look forward to learning from all of you and beg patience if I ask a couple of stupid questions."	t5_2qhuq	True
