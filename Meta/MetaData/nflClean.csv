At FAU, I was fortunate enough to play under legendary coach Howard Schnellenberger, who was also a former Redskins draft pick (1956). The Redskins selected me in the sixth round of the 2012 NFL Draft and I have enjoyed early success, breaking the Redskins’ rookie rushing record (1,106 yards) last week vs. New York.

The charges:

* A warrant was issued to seize surveillance footage from Hernandez's home.
* Hernandez had recently installed a 14 camera system with cameras inside and out.

* at 2:10AM Hernandez bought Gas, Bubbalicious blue cotton candy gum, and black and milds which are used for smoking marijuana (the prosecutor seems to be mistaken about common blunt cigars but oh well)
* Next they went to the victims home, at 2:32 am Hernandez sent a text ""we're here"" to the victim, this is when the victims sister saw him leave with them, Hernandez was driving
* They drove back to North Attleboro, this is corroborated by some random surveillance cameras and route was determined by time and distance traveled.
* during the ride, Hernandez had a conversation with the victim indicating he was upset with him. The two had gone to a club together Friday night.

* at the time of these texts, the car is seen on surveillance cameras in the area of the murder site/Hernandez's home
* Surveillance cameras show the vehicle driving down the road to the murder site at 3:23 AM

* at 3:30 AM Hernandez is seen with his companions in his driveway, one of whom has a gun.
* they go inside. Surveillance shows Hernandez walking around with a gun in his hand.
* all three go to the basement. Surveillance cameras shut off
* later that day, 5:30 PM Hernandez and his companions return the Nissan Altima to the rental agency, Hernandez offers the attendant Blue Bubbalicious.
* one of the side mirrors is broken on the car, footage of the vehicle earlier in the night suggest it wasn't broken when he left Boston, he tells the rental agency he didn't even notice it. The evidence being that it was broken sometime between leaving Boston and arriving back at home.
* He rents another car and returns home, companions leave.
* At the rental agency, a piece of bubbalicious and a shell casing were found, attendant threw them away. When questioned, she told investigators about it, they found it in the dumpster, Shell casing matched to the casings found at the scene.
* Tire impressions at the murder scene right next to the body were consistent with a front wheel drive vehicle (altima is FWD) 
* Investigators checked out the rental car. Tire treads matched those at the crime scene. Dirt found on the car also matched the crime scene
* They found a .22 nearby in a search of everywhere between Hernandez's home and the murder site. Hernandez a month prior had been involved an altercation in providence Rhode island. He had someone with him who was seen to place a gun under a car. This man matches the description of one of his companions on the night of the murder.
* The gun under the car in Providence was traced to a Florida gun store. The 22 found between Hernandez's home and the murder site was from the same store.
* further search warrant of Hernandez's home ordered. They found 22 ammo, but no 22 gun. They also found a large capacity 7.62 Hungarian semi auto rifle, and a fully loaded 32 round magazine . Hernandez's prints on it, he doesn't have the correct paperwork to own it.
* Not recovered was the Black semi auto handgun seen in Hernandez's hand before and after the murder. the second individuals gun not found either.
* Hernandez's girlfriend was spoken to by police, she was cooperating until a call from Hernandez telling her not to. She then stopped talking.
* the victim had defensive wounds and seemed to attempt to stop the bullets with his arms.

there also seems to be a sealed affadavit, so it looks like someone talked (especially since they know the convo with the victim in the car)

Another Man seems to have been arrested in connection with this case. [Carlos Ortiz](https://twitter.com/WesleyLowery/status/350222064935899136)

EDIT: [Hernandez reportedly being looked into in a double homicide from last year](http://www.myfoxboston.com/story/22702430/2013/06/27/source-hernandez-investigated-in-boston-double-killing) No clue about the validity, it's an unnamed source on a fox news affiliate so take it with a grain of salt.

[EDIT2: Full video of the arraignment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8einH-qELc)

EDIT 3: [Boston Globe reports victim may have been killed because he knew details of the double shooting Hernandez is being looked into for.
](https://twitter.com/GlobeMCramer/status/350283820353859584)

EDIT4: [Bail appeal hearing going on right now. Live video on NFL Network and ESPN](http://i.imgur.com/lNEpT0V.png?1) 

EDIT 5: apparently yesterday a warrant was issued for a condo in Hernandez's name. 3 boxes of .45 caliber ammo. Hummer registered to Hernandez outside the condo contained a magazine for a .45 handgun. Both the gun in the video seen in Hernandez's hand and the murder weapon were Glocks. 

Prosecutor: doesn't want to disclose motive that hasn't already been made public, but there is more than he is saying now. Repeats motive from yesterdays arraignment. victim and defendant had an argument last Friday. 

again references conversation in the car with the victim on the night of the murder. Hernandez indicates he is angry with the victim for talking to people Hernandez doesn't like at the club. Doesn't think he can trust him. 
""Hernandez had the motive and he was the one in control""

Sites [this image (I assume it's this image)](http://i.imgur.com/MfjGYqD.jpg) as an example of what the murder weapon would look like, and as proof he had one.

Judge: evidence circumstantial for sure, but VERY VERY strong. 

**BAIL DENIED**

EDIT 6: [Police impound an SUV that may connect Hernandez to 2012 double murder](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/06/27/cops-impound-suv-that-may-connect-hernandez-to-2012-killings/)

EDIT 7: [Police release wanted poster of 3rd suspect.](http://www.myfoxboston.com/story/22708728/2013/06/27/police-release-wanted-poster-in-connection-to-odin-lloyds-murder) wanted as an accomplice after the fact. last seen in a silver Chrysler 300 (which is what Hernandez rented when they turned in the car used during the murder)

(http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/zk998/lets_get_some_absurd_wagers_going_for_tomorrow/c65duq6)


As the clock winded down, Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers knew they were in trouble. Alas, the clock struck 0 and Packers were served their first loss of the season at the hands of Alex Smith and the San Francisco 49ers. The cameras rushed on the field to interview players. As ESPN's cameras ran towards Aaron Rodgers, they caught him shaking the hand of the joyous Alex Smith. ""Congrats!"" said Aaron as their eyes locked. Smith pulled Rodgers in closer. ""You played well."" Smith whispered. 

Aaron walked into the steamy locker room and began to undress. His gigantic dong flopped out of his uniform. A thundering bang was heard when it slapped against his leg. He hopped in the shower and began to cleanse himself of sweat and dirt. After his shower, he put on his normal attire: Boxers, shorts and a t-shirt. 

Aaron said his goodbyes to team mates and coaches and walked to his car. As he approached his car, he began to feel very odd. He looked around and saw nobody but felt as if he was being watched. As he continued to walk, something was not right. As he approached his car, a hand wrapped around his mouth and said, ""Don't make a sound."" As he began to panic, the hand pulled away and Aaron could hear laughter. Alex Smith was on the ground laughing. Aaron looked shocked. ""Alex, you asshole!"" He then playfully slapped Alex. ""Sorry, I couldn't help it!"" The two embraced each other and began to kiss slowly. Alex whispered, ""I'm sorry that I beat your ass on the field and now I am going to beat your ass in your backseat."" 

Aaron began to unzip Alex's pants. He grabbed his monstrous pecker and began to move his hand up and down. ""Oh yeah, Aaron. You know how daddy likes it."" Aaron dropped to his knees and put this huge thing in his mouth. He sucked up and down, licking the throbbing member quickly. His slobber coated Alex's penis. ""Ok get up Aaron."" Aaron quickly stood up and took his shorts off. ""Fuck my boy pussy Alex."" Alex thrusted himself deep inside Aaron's anus. Alex was grunting and Aaron was moaning. ""Yeah, take it you little bitch."" Aaron kept taking the dick into his hairy asshole. ""Fuck me harder!"" Alex pumped away. Aaron could feel his penis begin to swell. Within minutes, Alex blew his gigantic load inside Aaron's tight little butt hole. ""Well, I hope I see you in the post season."" whispered Alex. 

Ok fuck that, I can't believe I just did that.

Sure this place doesn't have the wide appeal some of the new default subreddits do, but /r/nfl has blown up in popularity so I was worried. I think we can all agree becoming a default subreddit is the kiss of death.

So have a sigh of relief, and enjoy the dodged bullet!

EDIT: Here was my reasoning for being fearful at all:  

&gt;/r/books was about 200k before it became a default subreddit, also /r/earthporn was always just below 300k.
At 170K, and one of the fastest growing subreddits over the past year, /r/nfl was definitely in the range of other subreddits that became default.  Moreover, our ""activity"" rating (posts, comments, etc) even in the offseason is top 60 on the entire site.  In addition, the fact that they only added a few new default subreddits does make it seem more unlikely, but what if they had decided to expand and add 10? 20? or even 30 default subreddits?  
As by *far* the most popular and well moderated sports subreddit, I could see the mods trying to infuse some sports into the front page if they greatly expanded the defaults.

Finally, the amount of traction this post has received still serves a good purpose even if you think we were never legitimately a threat to go default: it shows the mods here how serious we take not being a default subreddit."	t5_2qmg3	True

1347552149.0	ztsij	IAmA NFL Safety, Reshard Langford, AMA.	Langford_R	3378	1340	997	"For the next few hours, I am excited to answer questions and shed light on the life of an undrafted NFL athlete.

I am from Tanner, AL. Graduated high school in 2004. Attended Vanderbilt University where I graduated with a degree in Sociology in 2008. Went on to be an undrafted free-agent for the Philadelphia Eagles. On Dec. 25, 2009, I was signed to the Kansas City Chiefs through the 2011 season. As a restricted free-agent, I signed with the Detroit Lions in August 2012.

4hrs later: Thank you all for submitting some great questions and hopefully I gave some good insight. I'm about to grab lunch, go train, get a massage and watch some football. Follow me on Twitter @langford_r or on Google+ http://plus.google.com/107623923717612975081/

I am hopping off for a bit to finish up my day. Upvote the most popular questions and I'll get back on and answer some questions during the game tonight! Again, thanks and talk to you later.

***2012 Season Analysis***
***
**General**

* Going into 2012, it was impossible for the Saints (and their fans, for that matter) to really know what to expect.  This team had suffered the most tumultuous off-season in recent NFL history, and without head Coach Sean Payton for the season, the season had a very surreal air to it.

* There were also several other notable suspensions, including General Manager Mickey Loomis (8 games) linebacker coach/interim head coach Joe Vitt (6 games), defensive lineman Will Smith (4 games) and middle linebacker Jonathan Vilma (Season).  Eventually, with the exception of Loomis, Payton and Vitt, these suspensions would be lifted.  Offensive line coach Aaron Kromer was the Saints interim head coach the first 6 games of the season.

* The Saints season was one that was filled with ups and downs.  After starting 0-4, New Orleans was able to get it together to win 5 of 6 games and fans were allowed to dream again.  However, after finally getting a .500 record at 5-5, the Saints dropped 3 straight to the 49ers, the Falcons and the Giants.  Sitting at 5-8, all fans could hope for was a .500 season.  After trouncing the Bucs 41-0, the Saints defeated the Cowboys in a nail-biter.  However, at 7-8 the Saints fell to the Carolina Panthers, capping a disappointing 7-9 season.

**Highs**

* The Saints didn't really experience their first high until Week 5.  Against the San Diego Chargers in a sold out Superdome, Drew Brees completed a touchdown pass for the 48th consecutive game (his streak would be snapped at 54), surpassing the previous record of 47 held by Johnny Unitas.  This came en route to the first victory of the Saints season, allowing them to go into their bye week with momentum.

* Coming off the bye, the Saints were leading the Buccaneers 28-21 after halftime.  Bucs QB Josh Freeman completed a pass to Vincent Jackson from his own 5 yard line.  Jackson would run the ball down to the one yard before Malcolm Jenkins [chased him down.](http://cdn3.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1258673/vjax95.gif)  The subsequent goal line stand at the one yard line was a lone bright spot in an otherwise abysmal year for the Saints defense.  The Saints would eventually defeat Tampa Bay 35-28, thanks in no small part to that defensive stop.

* The Saints Week 9 defeat of Philadelphia may seem insignificant, but it actually proved to be a breakout game for one Mark Ingram.  Ingram only picked up 44 yards on 7 carries, but his 6.3 yards per carry were a vast improvement from his 2.6 average in Weeks 1-8.  Ingram would go on to average 4.3 yards per carry from Weeks 9-17.  This game gave many Saints fans (myself included) hope for the young back's future.  Chris Ivory also expanded OC Pete Carmichael Jr's potential to utilize Ingram.  This new-found ground game also established Joe Vitt's part in the New Orleans season.  He proved he was a hard-nosed coach that was willing to commit to the ground game to win games, a huge weight off the shoulders of Drew Brees.

* Week 10 proved to be the pinnacle of the Saints 2012 season.  The 8-0 Atlanta Falcons came to town looking to establish their dominance in the NFC South.  It turned into an exciting battle between two of the best Tight Ends in the game (calm down Pats fans, I'm not forgetting about Gronk and Hernandez), with Jimmy Graham and Tony Gonzalez catching two touchdown catches each, the latter picking up the 100th touchdown of his illustrious career.  Chris Ivory also returned with a bang, running for a 56 yard touchdown that would ultimately swing the momentum in the Saints favor.  With a little over a minute left, the Saints defense had another divisional goal line stop, with Matt Ryan's pass to Roddy White being broken up by Jabari Greer.  The Saints had dethroned the last undefeated team in the NFL, and that would ultimately prove to be the biggest bright spot in a trying 2012 season.

* In the second quarter of a Week 12 match-up against San Francisco, Marques Colston caught his 56th career touchdown, a 10 yard reception, thus surpassing long time fan favorite Deuce McAllister for the most touchdowns in franchise history.

**Lows**

* The Saints saw their biggest lows before the season began.  After they were incriminated in the infamous Bounty Gate scandal, the Saints found themselves severely depleted at the positions mentioned above.  This was arguably a large contributor to the mediocrity that the Saints suffered this year, and the cloud of Bounty Gate hung over their heads for the duration of the season.

* After a tough two losses to the Redskins and Panthers, the Saints faced the Chiefs in Week 3.  After starting off strong, New Orleans was in the driver's seat with an 18 point lead in the second half.  Kansas City, however, ravaged the Saints defense for 21 unanswered points, and the Saints eventually lost 27-24 in overtime.  This loss was heartbreaking in itself, but in addition it was at the hands of a team that didn't have a lead until Week 10 against the Pittsburgh Steelers (sorry Chiefs fans).

* The Saints were able to get to 5-5 going into Week 12 by winning 5 of 6 games.  However, after Thanksgiving, the Saints faced the San Francisco 49ers, Atlanta Falcons (again) and New York Giants in 3 straight weeks.  It was a chance for the Saints to prove that they could still roll with the big boys despite their woes of the season.  But the Saints lost all 3, with Brees throwing 9 of his league leading 19 interceptions in those 3 games.

* Despite the fact that I mentioned the Falcons game, it's worth noting the absolute nightmare that occurred in Week 13.  The Saints faced Atlanta in the Georgia Dome, and fans felt good.  However, Brees came out and threw an astounding 5 interceptions in a 23-13 loss.  Atlanta controlled the tempo of the game throughout despite losing the TOP battle by about 7 minutes: (New Orleans: 33:44 ; Atlanta: 26:16).  Atlanta maintained a 5.4 yards per carry rush average, and ultimately the turnovers killed the Saints.  To add insult to injury, the Falcons avenged their undefeated season by bringing Drew Brees' consecutive games with a TD record to a halt at 54 games.

* But wait, there's more!  The Saints final low came in Week 17 against the Carolina Panthers.  Trying to learn a new defensive system brought by coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, the defense never really got a clear grasp on what they were doing.  They gave up 530 yards to Cam Newton and the Panthers in a 44-38 loss, and thus broke the single season record for yards allowed in a season at 7,042.  The team that they surpassed?  The 1981 Baltimore Colts.  Let that sink in.  The Saints record also dropped to 7-9, and their hopes to at least salvage a .500 season were dashed.

**Free Agency/Draft Concerns**

* The Saints main positional needs are on defense, with them switching to the 3-4 in the upcoming season.

    * Outside Linebacker
  
    * Cornerback

    * Offensive Line (Namely LT and C).

* This part is tricky since a lot of restructuring needs to happen before the Saints can even begin to look at Free Agency options.  They're about $15 million in the hole in terms of cap space (only the Jets &amp; Cowboys are worse off), and the Saints will need to be largely reliant on the draft to improve their defense.  Expect for them to target Brian De La Puente and Jermon Bushrod first, since they're integral to the Saints offensive line.  They aren't really in a position to make any big moves for newly unrestricted Free Agents, so Mickey Loomis will likely try to focus on keeping his own Free Agents in house.

* In the first round of the draft, the Saints will almost certainly be looking for an OLB that can thrive in the 3-4 system.  While they'd love for Barkevious Mingo of LSU to drop down the 15th spot, expect him to be off the board.  Assuming that's the case, New Orleans will likely pick up Dion Jordan out of Oregon, who is a good open field tackler, something that the Saints sorely lacked last year.  Jordan's conversion to OLB from DE will be relatively painless, since Oregon often dropped him into coverage last year as well.

**Final Thoughts**

* Despite the circus that was the 2012 season, it wasn't a total wash.  The Saints scraped out a 7-9 record despite an off-season that could destroy some teams and a historically bad defense (literally the worst ever yardage wise).  With Sean Payton returning next year and seeming serious about making a lot of changes defensively (the 3-4 defense was his idea), along with Brees seeming hungrier than ever in public statements since the end of the season, the New Orleans Saints and their fans look forward to putting 2012 behind them and starting anew come 2013.

For those that don't know me, im a wide receiver for the Detroit Lions.  I'm originally from Norman Oklahoma. While in high school, I played free safety, wide receiver and running back. I also played point guard and shooting guard for our basketball team. I received offers to play both football and basketball in college, but decided to continue with football.  Graduated in the fall semester of 2011.  I was drafted by the Detroit Lions as the 54th overall pick. 

Some of my accomplishments: In my first game with Oklahoma, I set a school freshman record with 7 catches for 141 yards and a touchdown.  Set the NCAA FBS record for career receptions with 349. First team all big 12 in 2011.  Consensus All American in 2010 and 2011.  Detroit Lions rookie of the year in 2012.  And my career best high jump was 6'11""!

I love playing FIFA (Real Madrid) and hanging with my wife, dogs &amp; friends!

1369744904.0	1f724l	[Idea] Reddit wide 32 team fantasy league, each team run by a team subreddit.	tronbone	2463	836	423	"Sitting at work last night and I thought it would be a lot of fun if each subreddit ran their own fantasy team in a reddit wide fantasy league. *I am in no way volunteering to run this myself.* However, if someone does decide to run with this idea, god bless. I thought of a couple sample rules that might kick this off. However not being a regular fantasy guy there is probably some things that need adding or removing.

**Sample rules:**

* Each team must in the first round take a player from their own team.
Example: /r/minnesotavikings must take a Viking. Why? If you're a Vikings fan and your subreddit's team doesn't have a single Viking, not much fun.

* Each team can only draft 1 QB.
Why? It is very likely only 32 QBs are going to play each week. QB hogging ruins fun.

* Each team must draft their own defense
Why? Because most likely we will be watching our home team and this makes it so people are more invested. (Not 100% of this one)


EDIT: Wow this seems to be taking off. I'm glad people like it! If anyone is interested in actually putting this together message me and I will try to get your username up here.


EDIT2: Seems like a 32 team league would just be too difficult. It looks like 2, 16 team leagues split between AFC and NFC team subs is the prevailing sentiment currently. 


EDIT3: Something is the works already, but I must sleep. Will unveil later today? God damn the hive mind is amazing.

EDIT4: /u/ChrisTroy has taken it upon himself to start a fantasy league on myfantasyleague.com (more information below). Also I have taken it upon myself seeing the variety of responses to set up a small google poll to decide where people are at, [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/15LET2cvam7YT9bIb1lsOvtVw_5OigtqYPNt5_RrCCbI/viewform).

Anyway, I'm from Dallas but I don't feel like I want to make the cowboys ""my team."" So who do ya'll think would be more fun to watch.

Additionally, I like to read up on stuff, so what are your go-to resources to pick up info/stats/plays etc for the season?

**Edit:** Holy shit dudes. Thanks so much, this has been a great help. 

Also, I told yall not to upvote. Assholes.

**P.S.** --I am going to be watching the Boys tonight to see how they do, but I do really like the idea of rooting for the Skins. Also, the Texans and Packers are high in my esteem, so I'll be keeping an eye on all of thems. But who knows, maybe I'll wind up liking the Raiders :P Thanks again everyone."	t5_2qmg3	True

I will be arriving in full protest tomorrow (Tuesday 9/25) at noon. If even one of you show up, it's a victory for the fans.

**UPDATE:** Hey guys, not sure what I was expecting but not a whole lot of people showed up for the protest. Looking back, we probably should have scheduled it outside of work hours and allowed more than 12 hours' notice.

However, I still believe something in the form of protest can be done. I think the day for it should be Sunday, and I think the place for it should be at stadiums nation-wide. If all of us band together to spark a fan uprising, there is potential for change. Based on the NFL's response to last night's blatant gaffe, it might be our only hope."	t5_2qmg3	True

If you guys aren't aware, there was a post in /r/modnews about a new reddit feature that will [allow comment scores to be hidden for a set amount of time](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1dd0xw/moderators_new_subreddit_feature_comment_scores/). Of course, once the number of minutes elapse the comment scores will be revealed. 

Us mods are currently discussing the pros and cons of this feature and would think that it could be ripe for experimentation. As you may guess, the biggest pro for this feature, and one of the reasons why we want to try it out, is because it could help in avoiding bandwagon/circlejerk type comments reaching the top of comment heaps and providing other multiple child comments as well. As we all know, non-bias is a big part of this sub reddit as we all follow 32 different types of teams. This means fairness and equality are pretty darn important.

We mods always have the best interest at heart when making any changes so we went to present this to you to gauge how you would feel on this subject.

Please upvote for visibility (...or fear that I will come down upon you with the force of 1,000 suns) and leave constructive feedback as to whether or not you would like to see this implemented in r/nfl. And if so, in your opinion what would be an acceptable amount of time to hide comment scores?

With regards to the Redskins possible rename, we mods feel it would be best if we removed all articles regarding it *UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE NAME IS ACTUALLY CHANGED OR THERE IS SIGNIFICANT NEWS FROM THE NFL OR THE REDSKINS.*

The reasons for this are as follows:

* The argument itself has been absolutely beaten into the ground in this sub, with the same two types of comments posted over and over, and at this point no value is being added.

(Here are the two points: Point 1: It's not racist. Point 2: It's racist, how would you feel if they were called the Washington insert slur here.)

* There's no ""debating"", there's no agreement or common ground to be found. 

* The threads regarding the name all devolve into name calling and racial slurs being thrown about constantly, which as you all know, is against the rules of the sub.

* It's a political topic, and politics are not discussed in r/NFL. Again, as a reminder, if and when the team changes it's name, we will obviously want to have discussion regarding that, but at this time there is no apparent end in sight for this debate.

Due to the above reasons, we will be removing any and all links to it until there are actual comments *from the NFL/Redskins regarding a name change, truly significant news, or the subject is dropped for good.*

Thanks, and we hope you understand,
Mod team

I responded that it is good to know that the KC Chiefs have an immature teenager running their social media. 

I, as a fan for my whole life of nearly 40 years, who has never seen the Chiefs in a Superbowl, nor have I seen a playoff win in nearly 20 years, nor have I seen a QB drafted [EDIT: in the first round] in the last 27 years... We have a right to be pissed. The Kansas City Chiefs have no right to be pissy toward the fans. We are the ones paying your salaries. Shame on you, Chiefs. Oh, and congrats on 50 years of being in KC. 10 years of greatness, followed by 40 years of pathetic profiteering.  Clark Hunt sits in Dallas siphoning the Kansas City dollars.

If you didn't participate, it simply asked you, for each team, if you loved,liked,hated,disliked or are indifferent towards them. I was inspired by a /r/baseball survey which gave [this chart](http://i.imgur.com/ZniXm.png).

Now onto our results. Sit back, relax, and grab a good drink because I analyzed the heck out of this data.

- in 2 days we had 3006 survey takers
- The average respondent loves 1.5 teams, likes 5.8 teams,is indifferent towards 14.4 teams, dislikes 5.6 teams, and hates 4.2 teams
- The average team had 151 loves, 556 likes, 1372 indifferent's, 531 dislikes and 397 hates
- 13 respondents love their team and hate every other team.

""Score"" - the score is the averaging of the results. It counts hates as -2, dislikes as -1, indifferent's as 0, likes as 1, and loves as 2, then divides by total responses. Scores range from -2 to 2. -2 is pure hate, 2 is pure love, 0 is balanced.

- The average score was -.15 which means people were more negative than positive.
- 13 people scored the lowest -1.85, those were the people who scored their team as love and the rest as hate
- 2208 people scored negatively (rating more teams hates/dislikes than like/loves)
- 177 people scored 0 (balancing the amount of hates/dislikes with likes/loves)
- 663 people were positive (more likes/loves)
- 11 teams scored positively (more people gave them likes/loves than hates/dislikes) : Bills, Colts, Packers, Bengals, Niners, Vikings, Browns, Seahawks, Redskins, Broncos and Texans. All other teams have a negative score (more dislikes/hates)

**The CHART!!!** Here's the /r/NFL version of that baseball chart :

- [Sorted by score](http://i.imgur.com/WTPE6.png)
- [Sorted by love](http://i.imgur.com/kZVW4.png)
- [Sorted by love+like](http://i.imgur.com/y0xeL.png)
- [Sorted by indifference](http://i.imgur.com/7Tgmk.png)
- [Sorted by dislikes+hate](http://i.imgur.com/IK6hs.png)
- [Sorted by hate](http://i.imgur.com/kIil0.png)
- [As a vertical bar chart instead of a horizontal stacked] (http://i.imgur.com/MiAVD.png)
 
So congrats to Houston for being the best liked team (by score). Seattle got the most loved. Dallas most hated. Jets worst overall opinion (lowest scored).

[Here's a chart showing each division summed together, and NFC/AFC](http://i.imgur.com/Nzu0V.png)

[Here's a table showing the numbers behind the chart](http://i.imgur.com/cmHfQ.png) or [with percentages](http://i.imgur.com/mUKhq.png)

**The Fans**

For simplicity, a Fan of a team is someone who put a 'love' vote for a team. I know that's not the definition of a fan, but fan is easier to put than ""people who put love"". So from now on the ""Fan opinions"" are from selecting the opinions of people who put love for a specific team. (Makes sense right?)

[A table of fan opinions of other teams](http://i.imgur.com/tdBwH.png) Red = negative, blue = positive. 

If you don't want to look at a bunch of numbers, here are some quick fun facts

- The only fanbase to not have a negative score against New England is Arizona (scored 0)
- The only fanbase to score Houstan negatively are Titans fans
- The only fanbase to score the Bengals negatively were the other AFC north teams. The only fanbase to score the Browns negatively were the Steelers fans.
- The only fanbases to score Washington negatively are other NFC East teams.
- Tampa Bay is only disiked by the NFC South and NFC East
- The only fanbases who dislike the Vikings are the other NFC North teams.
- Every fanbase dislikes the Jets, the Cowboys and the Eagles.
- Your opinion of a team is more based on what team it is and less about who your team is.

**FAN CHARTS**

Here are charts like the one above, but from the perspective of the fans of these teams, in two forms : stacked = horizontal bars on top of each other, bars = vertical bars. From these charts you can see the opinions a team's fans have of other teams.

Fan Positivity : [This chart](http://i.imgur.com/N0pIB.png) shows the average score of how fans of one team scored all the other teams. From it you can see that Chiefs, Bills and Rams fans are the only fans who on average, think positively of other teams. Cowboy fans think the most negatively of other teams.

**Fan Rivalry**

To get a measure of rivalries, I added the two teams opinions of each other. (I had a better measurement method, but it was too complicated an crashed my spreedsheets, so we'll keep it simple). This simple method should make sense, as if team A rates team B -1 and B rates A -1 their score is -2 which since both fans don't like each other we'll call that a rivalry. If A rates B -1, and B rates A 1, add them together = 0 - which isn't much of a rivalry as not both teams are competitive against each other.

[Here's a table of the rivalries](http://i.imgur.com/djMkT.png).  I highlighted scores less than -2 as Black - which are the biggest rivalries. Scores less than -1 are highlighted Red - which are pretty good rivalries. And scores greater than one are highlighted blue aren't rivalries but more ""friends"" (each team has a 4 next to themselves because 2+2).

Once again if you don't want to look at a wall of numbers here are some key points

- NE v. NYJ biggest 'rivalry' scoring -3.11
- Other big rivalries are : NE v. MIA (-2.7), SD v. OAK (-2.36), CIN v. PIT (-2.26), BAL v. PIT (-2.58), DAL v. PIT (-2.32), NYG v. NE (-2.39), NO v. ATL (-2.41), GB v CHI (-2.67), DAL v. NYG (-3), DAL v. PHI (-2.98), DAL v. WAS (-2.6), PHI v. NYG (-2.5)
- There are 53 other rivalries which scored less then -1 (but greater than -2)
- Since there are 512 'match-ups' between teams, 10% of match-ups are between 'rivals'.
- There are 4 ""friends"" : Denver and Houston (+1.66) Broncos and Colts (+1.59) &lt;- who would think the two horse teams would band together (and I know, it's really because of Manning),  Seattle and Houston (+1.03), and Niners and Ravens (+1.1) &lt;- Harbros!!!

Edit : As requested- the largest asymmetries between two teams (biggest difference between what two teams think of each other)

- Seahawks and Steelers (1.7 difference)
- Jets and Texans (1.57 difference)
- Redskins and Steelers (1.47 difference)
- Jets and Denver (1.46 difference)
- Broncos and Cowboys (1.37 difference)
- Bills and Cowboys (1.37 difference)
- Texans and Steelers (1.31 difference)

**vs. R/Baseball**

the analyzers at /r/baseball did a least sum of squares test to see which teams opinions most closely resembles each other. I did something similar (but much cooler), I used the test to see which Football team matches up with what baseball team and vice versa. 

[Here's Football teams to Baseball teams] (http://i.imgur.com/jNOhC.png)

[and Baseball teams to Football teams](http://i.imgur.com/wxq4n.png)

[Here's a list of baseball abbreviations if you are unfamiliar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Baseball/Team_abbreviations)

- Note : The /r/NFL column is always referring to the football team, the /r/baseball columns are always referring to the baseball teams. So because the Seahawks and Mariners are both abbreviated SEA, you have to read the table correctly to know which one it's talking about. Hopefully the table isn't that confusing.

[Here's a graph showing the Baseball and Football results together!](http://i.imgur.com/RpQf1.png) - in the chart all baseball teams have white diagonal stripes in their bars, every football team has brackets [] around their name.

From what you can see, the R/NFL's hate of the Cowboys is not as impressive as R/Baseball's hate of the Yankees.

**DATA**

If you are as statistically sadistic as I am here's the data I analyzed :

Whew!!!! Finished this whole project before the end of the Two Towers!!! Now time to do some stats for my Fantasy football league.

Edit : Given how well this has worked, if I can remember, I'll be doing this again at the start of next season and compare the results (and again a year from now).

Edit 2 : Thank you very much to the anonymous user who gave me reddit gold. That was very nice of you and just made my morning. (Much better than a bunch of screaming kids). 

Also - Thunderkleize proposed the idea to do this survey, but with players, instead of teams. I'll be up for doing it around the pro-bowl week, as that seems like the most appropriate time."	t5_2qmg3	True

1376340112.0	1k8bac	I'd like to introduce a new idea for the upcoming season...	Agent4nderson	1876	537	299	"I started a subreddit called /r/CharitableBets a while ago. 

The idea is that a bet is made (pitting the glory of your team against that of another, calling how many points a game will be won by, who will progress to the finals or anything else you can think of - and I've been informed you guys will bet on anything!) between two redditors and the loser pays out a pre-determined amount to a pre-determined charity. 

It's fun, you get to gloat afterwards and the losers don't really lose - the charities you pick definitely win. 

Personally, I'd keep the monetary values low, but higher value bets are acceptable!

My subreddit had little interest until /r/NBA blew it up, now we have over $500 in confirmed donations. I'd love to see the /r/NFL posters take that a step further. 

I'll throw out an opening bet (to be accepted by one person only!) for $5 that the NY Giants will beat the Indianapolis Colts in their game in 6 days. I don't know if that's a clever bet or not, but supporting the Knicks is a good reason to bet on the Giants, right? Haha. 

If there's enough interest, I'll make some other bets too!

1353284154.0	13f8cn	I'm a Browns fan and I just need to vent	require_once	1699	373	644	"Warning: the following rant is a massive load of pessimism and self pity. Browns fans under the age of 18 should seek parental permission before reading.

I was born in a Cleveland hospital in 1985. I don't remember the drive, or the fumble, but I was raised by men whose demeanor was shaped by those agonies. I do remember Bernie Kosar. I remember the disdain directed at Bill Belichick when he inserted Vinny Testaverde at quarterback, who I thought they called ""Vinny-testing-Bernie"", a sort of interim player only intended to re-light Bernie's spark. In my young mind Bernie Kosar always was and always would be the Cleveland quarterback.

I remember when Art Modell became the devil incarnate after it was announced that the Browns were moving to Baltimore. I remember sitting around in silence, wallowing in impotent rage that nothing could be done to stop him. My best friend's family became Steelers fans. So did my teacher. Meanwhile, my father and I no longer had anything in common and we grew apart. By the time the Browns came back my Dad had experienced some religious conversion and was no longer interested in football.

I remember watching every game of the 1999 season, a team that was way out of its league but that played with enough heart and desperation to eek out two victories. It feels like I've been watching that same team every year since. It has been thirteen years and what amazes me is, no matter who puts on the Browns jersey, no matter who puts on the coach's headset, they always act like the Cleveland Browns. Even the medical staff has not been immune to performing ""Browns-ian"".

We made the playoffs in 2002, but that didn't feel like a legit playoff team. We got some lucky breaks and backed into the playoffs with a backup quarterback, only to lose to the Steelers in the wildcard game. We were 10-6 in 2007, and while that team was exciting to watch we were still making the same Browns mistakes: losing to a bad Raiders team, not picking up a win over the Steelers, and Derek Anderson throwing two awful interceptions just before halftime against the Bengals resulting in a loss, to a team that we were clearly better than, and missing the playoffs.

It has been thirteen years of the media treating us like the Washington Generals, when they bother to acknowledge us at all. Thirteen years of commercials with Browns players trailing helplessly in the background, of announcers snickering ""well if you play this bad against the Browns you must really suck"", of unfavorable officiating (bottlegate still gets on my nerves).

Most fans know what it feels like to have an awful season, and some fans know what it's like to have an awful decade, but nothing compares to Cleveland in my lifetime. In the background of all this suck (because in Cleveland any sport other than football is really a sideshow) you have a baseball team that chokes in the World Series twice (1995 and 1997) before unloading all their talent in the interest of money, and then doing it again after the 2007 ACLS. You also have a basketball team that finds a savior only to see him fail in the biggest moments and then turn his back on the people who worshiped him.

You all know the history, and Cleveland isn't the only sports city to have suffered. Yet nowhere else will ever compare because sports are all that Cleveland has. It doesn't have beautiful beaches, or beautiful people, it doesn't have remarkable shopping or live shows. The summers are too hot, the winters are too slushy and gross, and the other seasons are mostly cloudy. Cleveland has the “Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!” which is good for a few hours of entertainment every few years.

Do you know why I warned incoming Cleveland fans of the pessimism and self-pity contained herein? It's because the entire city is awash with it, and you can't live in that mindset 365 days a year without going mad. So most residents carry around a shield of unreasonable optimism because they will crack if one more arrow of pessimism makes its way in.

I moved away as soon as I finished high school. I've lived in Packer country for the past eight years, but I remain a Browns fan. Why? My father grew up a Bears fan, but became a Browns fan when he landed a job in Cleveland. This was a natural transition for him. The Browns games were the only ones on tv, the Browns were plastered all over the newspaper, and all his new friends and co-workers were Browns fans. I have not followed suite to become a Packers fan because Sunday Ticket, Redzone, and internet streams and blogs have allowed me to continue to follow my home team in a way that my father's generation never could. I telecommute for work. My boss lives in sunny California and couldn't care less about football. My friends are Packers fans, and Bears, and Lions, and Giants fans. I have no impetuous to switch allegiance other than the fact that the team of my childhood sucks.

You want a guaranteed get rich scheme? Imagine heartbreaking scenarios for Cleveland sports fans, bet on it, and repeat.

The Browns have a new owner and will soon undergo yet another reboot. We'll have new coaches, and possibly a new quarterback, and if history holds true they will perform like Browns no matter who is brought in. That is what is reasonable to expect. I know people will give X, Y, and Z reasons why this is not reasonable, why the Browns can't continue to suck forever, and a lot of those will be the same reasons that I've heard since way back when Bernie was benched. I don't know if it's a league wide conspiracy to keep the Browns down, or a function of the attitude that pervades the city, or the will of God himself but there is something out there in the cosmos that is causing all this pain and until that relents I will continue to regard myself as an idiot for watching those orange-helmeted sportsmen every Sunday.

What's worse is the time I devote to reading Browns blogs, which I impulsively open first thing every morning. What's even dumber are the showers and lunch-breaks and the long drives that I spend thinking one more time about what went wrong with that game or that draft pick or that season. But worst of all is that I can't even cheer anymore. When the Browns complete a long pass I scream, not out of joy but out of frustration from all those previous times that made this one completion look like a miracle. Do you know how many Browns fans felt good about a 13-0 lead at half today? None of them, because we've been here before. We know how this story ends. Now that the season is completely meaningless I'm sure we'll pick up a couple more unimpressive wins, just enough to knock our draft position down out of the top tier talent.

After the Browns came back, my Dad always said, ""I'll be dead long before the Browns win a Superbowl."" Last year that proved to be correct.

I don't know what my point is with all this. I guess I'm just spent. Sorry guys.

**tl;dr:** I'm a Browns fan.

**Edit:** Wow, thanks for the kind and supportive words everyone. I feel a lot better after getting this off my chest (and a good night's sleep). I don't know why out of all the disappointing Browns games this one in particular set me off. All of my feelings just kind of crystallized at once and I got upset. I'm going to distance myself from NFL coverage for a few weeks to get some perspective back. I'll probably still watch the games, though. I hope you all have a pleasant Monday :)

**Edit 2:** Cleveland isn't a bad city and I shouldn't have criticized it. I haven't lived there for 8 years, and many people have been working very hard to make it a more wonderful place. I was miserable when I did live there, and I've projected my personal problems on the city itself and that isn't fair."	t5_2qmg3	True

***2012 Season Analysis***

---

**General**

* The Chiefs came in under expectations this year, while many picked them to win the division, they finished at 2-14.
* The Offense was stagnant, scoring the least points in the league at 211. This is mainly attributed to the QB play, which was mediocre at the very best.
* The one bright spot on the offense was Jamaal Charles, who had another Pro Bowl year coming off an ACL injury that ended his 2011 campaign.
* The Defense played well considering the circumstances, measuring around the middle of the pack around the league despite a -24 TO margin.
* The Defense also recorded 4 pro bowlers, including newbie Justin Houston.
* The Special Teams was one of the only special things about the Chiefs this year, seeing Dustin Colquitt making the Pro Bowl and Ryan Succop recording a good year kicking despite a shaky finish.

**High Points**

* Jamaal Charles is the big one here. Jamaal had 5.3 YPC, which while being high, was his worst as a starter since he turned pro. His 5.8 YPC is an NFL record as of now for the number of attempts he has. He also had 3 80+ Yard runs, which ties the NFL record for most in a season. Many people also forget he is also coming off a season ending ACL injury just like AD. Jamaal is the one constant thing in a Chiefs offense, other than the O-Line, full of disappointments and failures.
* The O-Line did play well despite losing Center Rodney Hudson during the beginning games of the year. Ryan Lilja did fill fine moving from Guard to Center, and him retiring is a blow, but the O-Line promises to be good again next year if the Chiefs front office signs depth.
* The Defense still has a lot of talent, as shown by the 4 Pro Bowlers. Houston was the most improved player on the team, recording a great Sophomore year alongside Tamba Hali. Both of the players recorded over 66% of the sacks for the Chiefs. Alongside them is Derrick Johnson, who had another All-Pro caliber year; along with Brandon Flowers, who played well despite having a few injuries and not having a solid CB2 half the year.. Add in Eric Berry and the Defense is stacked with talent, and performed well considering the terrible offense on the other side of the ball.
* Dontari Poe played well in his rookie year, especially at the end of the year. While not lights out, he definitely showed improvement and we'll have to see how his 2013 campaign is to make further judgment, but he is showing promise on the Defensive Line as of now.
* The Carolina Game was probably the most inspiring thing I've ever seen, and everyone should be proud of how they played that day. It was the peak of a rocky season.
* The only other win of the year, the win against the Saints, was a record setting day for Jamaal and a nice come from behind victory, but it was nothing to write home about.
* I'll just call all the Front Office changes good, Andy, John Dorsey, and the coaches they brought in all seem ready and dedicated.
* [This](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1555617/garoreturns.gif) play also made my year.

**Low Points**

* Just to get this out of the way, the off-the-field issues for the Chiefs were less than ideal. First was the whole thing with Eric Winston that was beaten to death. Not only that, but the whole ordeal seemed like a distraction to a team that did not need distractions. Second was the Belcher situation which did lead to an inspiring day of football the next day, but was a terrible, terrible tragedy. 
* All the games were bad, but the Thursday Night game in Week 8 against the Chargers was flat out **embarrassing**. I don't know how a team could play worse than the Chiefs played that night. The only good thing coming from that was a hilarious game thread here on /r/nfl (right [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/12hfji/game_thread_kansas_city_chiefs_16_san_diego/) is said game thread.) That one game was the epitome of the entire 2012 Chiefs season.
* Another embarrassing game was the one against the Colts, where Peyton Hillis and Jamaal Charles scorched their Defense for 352 yards. Despite this impressive number, the Chiefs only scored 13 points that day, and lost to the Andrew Luck led Colts 20-13. You needed further proof the Chiefs need a QB? There it is.
* Onto the players, the WR's this year were a bit of a disappointment, players like Baldwin and Breaston were non-existent in the offense. I am more than willing, though, to give them a pass for this year they had no QB and the Offensive Coordinator was atrocious. 
* Matt Cassel/Brady Quinn are obviously not the answer at QB. The rushing game for the Chiefs was 5th in the league while passing was dead last, plus the fact that they threw **less than 10 Touchdowns combined** shows that both are not starter material. In a QB league, you need a starting QB to win, the Chiefs barely have quality back up on their roster.
* Brian Daboll is not a good Offensive Coordinator. His demeanor is childish, his playcalling unoriginal, and his strategies are wild at best. Every Chiefs fan is glad he is gone, and I pray none of you ever get him as your Offensive Coordinator.
* Romeo Crennel is a nice guy, but that wasn't enough to be a Head Coach. Not only that, but trying to take on the DC responsibilities as well was a mistake. Even though he ""fired"" himself as DC, it was too late. He had lost the team, and he had no clue what he was doing. One press conference when asked why Jamaal Charles only got 5 carries, he said, ""I don't know.""
* Scott Pioli's has had few success stories here, and too many failures. The talent the Chiefs have is from Herman Edwards and Carl Peterson, Pioli's ""big move"" was Matt Cassel, and sticking with him so long was Pioli's downfall. It says a lot when the 3rd highest all time post on /r/kansascitychiefs is news of Scott Pioli getting fired.

---

**Free Agency/Draft Concerns**

---
*QB, Potential Remedies: Alex Smith, Matt Flynn, Geno Smith, Tyler Wilson, or another QB in the draft.*

The Chiefs obviously need a QB, now the question is what is Reid going to do? Honestly, I have no freaking clue. Alex Smith seems more likely, but there isn't that much info coming from the front office on this one. I can tell you a lot of people do not want Alex in KC, as many see him as Matt Cassel 2.0. I would bet $100 that every time between now and the draft if you tune into a KC sports talk show, they will be arguing over whether to take a QB at #1 overall. I do not know if the Chiefs should or not, but the desire for a franchise QB is ever present for the fans of the Chiefs.

*Offensive Line, Potential Remedies: Luke Joeckel, Re-Sign Brandon Albert, one of the few FA T and Guards.*

It's hard to predict who will resign right now regarding Free Agents, but I'm saying O-Line is important to the Chiefs for there is no depth there. Couple that with Albert being up for contract and Lilja retiring, the Chiefs need to move a few pieces on the Line to maintain its form. If the team doesn't re-sign Albert, that is a good sign they will draft Joeckel, so one can see that they will have a solid LT no matter what. Guard is a position that needs to be addressed while also adding depth there and at Center. 

*Inside Linebacker, Potential Remedies: Scott Fujita, Leroy Hill, Danelle Ellerbee, Mid Round Pick in Draft.*

Belcher left a hole to the left of Derrick Johnson, one that if filled with a decent Linebacker could make that one of the most dangerous Linebacking cores in the league. Any of the Free Agent ILB's out there would fit in nicely, whether it was Scott Fujita, Leroy Hill, or Dannell Ellerbe, or any others, for it won't take a star to round out the linebacking core for the Chiefs. Note, **I am purely speculating with this**, but anything is, honestly, better than what they have at ILB, which are 3rd string players at best.

***Other Concerns:*** WR, Defensive Line, Cornerback.

Unfortunately, I have no college experience so I have nothing to show at this time other than what I may/ may not do at the combines. How would I go about finding an agent that can help get me in front of the right people? I'm looking for any opportunity to get into a position where I can demonstrate my abilities both on and off the field. Google doesn't seem to be any help, so any tips or advice from here would be greatly appreciated. Thank You!

EDIT: Wow.. thank you for the support everyone, I really wasn't expecting this to take off like it has. I have at least another 4 and a half on the road so once I get the chance I'll try to get in here and answer everyone's questions.

EDIT: Just wanted to answer a quick question upfront - I've been out of the game for a while because I'm currently serving in the Air Force. I went through ROTC at the University of Delaware but ended up having to take classes at another school that didn't have football.

EDIT: For those who didn't see, I wanted to thank everyone for their support and thank you Chris Kluwe for time and advice, it all really means a lot to me.  My first combine is in Cleveland on Feb 17.. so hopefully I can get some decent numbers and video that I can throw up here.  The second is Mar 23rd in Baltimore.  I'll definitely keep everyone posted as I continue through the process.  I know it'll be tough.. but I'll be working extra hard now knowing I've got Reddit cheering me on ;) keep an eye out for an update on 17/18 Feb!"	t5_2qmg3	True

2. Ben Roethlisberger pass to Santonio Holmes in the final minutes of the Superbowl against the Steelers

Can you imagine Kurt Warner's legacy if he had won those two additional Superbowls on top of what people already think of him? Albeit exaggerated, he's a former Arena Football League QB that used to be a bag boy at a grocery store leading the Greatest Show on Turf and then leading the abysmal Cardinals within 35 seconds of winning the superbowl? If he had won. Good lord. He'd be in the conversation as one of the best quarterbacks of all time and that JUST hit me. I'm blown away."	t5_2qmg3	True

1334156578.0	s4emo	Can we talk, r/NFL?	Angry_Caveman_Lawyer	1921	753	871	"Hey folks,

We've been noticing lately a more and more popular trend here in [/r/nfl](/r/nfl), one that we think is ridiculously stupid.  That's the use of derogatory terms like ""faggot"" and ""gay"" to diss a fan or a player or whatever.

Seriously?  Are we 12?  What is this shit?  As you've probably seen, if you post something and use these words, your comment gets deleted.

[/r/NFL](/r/NFL) is **NOT** ESPN, or yahoo sports, or any of these other sites where that kind of stuff is ""edgy"" and ""cool"".  So please don't do it.

If we see a commenter using these words more than once, they'll be on a short list for banning.

While sexual orientation shouldn't matter, I am sure we do have gay and lesbian fans in here and as such, they should be respected the same as anyone else.

This is a big place, with a lot of people who post here, and similar to stupid memes like eff the cowboys and all the Tebow stuff, this needs to stop.

The whole goal of this sub is for fans to get together and talk about the NFL, have fun in game threads, trash talk, etc., and if we're alienating part of our subscribers, that's not good.

Other than that, keep on keepin' on, [/r/NFL](/r/NFL).  We've got the draft coming up and hopefully another AMA will pop up here soon, stay tuned for details.

Thanks,

&lt;3,

ACL

### Game Threads

Everybody loves game threads. They are what make any sports related subreddit great. However, given the number of games that happen every week, we simply don't have time to be responsible for creating all of them. That's where you come in. ANY USER MAY CREATE A GAME THREAD. On the sidebar, under the ""Misc."" category, there is a guide to [creating game threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/help/faqs/NFL#Gamethreads).

Just a couple of points we want to make clear about the game threads however. Any bias show in the game thread post itself is not allowed. You must wait until an hour before the game starts to post a game thread. Please check the new tab before posting your game thread, to make sure there isn't already one. Any posts that don't follow these guidelines will be removed. If you happen to see a post that is violating these guidelines, send us a message and we'll take care of it.

**We're still just getting used to it ourselves, but there is a new way to follow game threads in real time. If you are in a game thread, you can add ""-stream"" right after ""reddit"" on the web address, it will take you to a website that adds comments as they come. It's not without its flaws, ~~especially a lack of flair~~ it does include flair now though, but it is an interesting new way to keep up to the minute and not miss anything.**

**Also, if you aren't already familiar, we have an /r/nfl IRC chat room that is always open. It becomes very active on game days and is a lot of fun. You can find directions on how to get in on the sidebar.**

-----

### Flair Up And Join Your Team's Sub!

If you don't have flair already, on the sidebar right under where it gives the subreddit population, click on the ""edit"" button next to your username and select your flair.

Then, scroll down the sidebar and click on your team's flair in the schedule. It will take you to your team's subreddit. Subscribe. Some of the team specific subs are more active than others, but the only way to get your's active is by doing something about it. At the beginning of last season, very few were active, now many of them are. The rest will likely follow suit over the next year.

-----

### Official Threads

There are a few threads that we will make weekly. Unofficial versions of these threads were allowed during the offseason, but during the season it's best to just have one standard of each thread. The time of posting during the week for each is set, but subject to change based on our availability or to improve effectiveness.

**TRASH TALK threads** will be posted every Thursday around noon, EST. Feel free to crack wise about your opponent, your division rival, or whatever you want. Normal posting guidelines are relaxed so don't take anything personally and don't let it spill out into the rest of r/nfl. If there is a special case that needs attention, let us know.

**Complain About Your Team threads** will be posted on Tuesday around noon, EST. Here's your chance to gripe about your team's flaws. That says it all.

**Power Ranking threads are posted by Sevsquad every Tuesday. Any of the power rankings that are included in that post are subject to be removed if posted by other users. This is just a measure to prevent clutter and he does a great job of doing it in a timely and easy to follow manner.**

**We are temporarily shelving the Gif/Pic/Request thread until we've decided on a better way to implement it. In the meantime we will have very high standards in allowing gif and pic posts through so as not to let them overrun the sub. If you post a Gif or Pic and it is removed, it's okay to send us a message asking why, and we will try to give you an explanation.**

### Posting Guidelines

If you haven't already, read [this faq on our posting guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/qm0hx/new_guidelines_for_rnfl_please_read/).

As a reminder, personal attacks and fan base attacks in comments will be removed. Just don't do it. Repeated offenses can result in being banned.

Memes, gifs, ""this guy"" pictures, and other content lacking in relevance or quality will be removed, as will ""joke"" posts of any kind. Feel free to post them at /r/nflcirclejerk or /r/nfffffffluuuuuuuuuuuu as you see fit.

**Specifically, circlejerk type material is subject to being removed. We all know how much ESPN loves some players and teams and hates others. We don't need screen shots. You are just propagating the disease. This also applies to errors on TV or websites pertaining to player stats, names, etc.**

**We are moving away from satire posts. The problem is that even though there are occasionally ones which are actually funny or poignant, the vast majority are inane, circlejerkesque, and clutter the sub significantly. This is a work in progress for us and we don't have the specific parameters laid out just yet. They are welcome in /r/nflcirclejerk and /r/nfffffffluuuuuuuuuuuu, which we expect to grow significantly.**

**Do not post to /r/nfl from your own blog. There is now a subreddit specifically directed at user operated blogs, /r/nflblogs. Please post there instead as if you post to /r/nfl it will be removed and labelled as spam. We have to take a firm stance on this because there is such a mass of content coming in from user made blogs and again, while there is occasionally quality content, the majority is lacking significantly. We can't make exceptions. If your blog is good enough, people will find it and post it to /r/nfl without your direct involvement. That's how this has to work.**

**Madden related posts will now be subject to removal. /r/madden is now an active sub and again, we are trying to limit clutter.**

Please, please, please, don't downvote users based on flair. We know it's tempting to downvote a fan of a division rival who said something you don't agree with, but try not to. It stifles conversation. Also, reserve your downvotes for comments that do not add to the discussion or are off-topic. Just because someone thinks your team isn't likely to win a specific game or you think they are underrating your QB, don't downvote them. Tell them why you disagree, or upvote someone else who has already expressed your opinion. Be liberal with your upvotes r/nfl. They may have no redeeming value in real life, but it creates a much better environment for debate with fewer petty insults.

Finally, please don't make submissions asking us to change the sidebar pic. We work hard to come up with interesting, fair, and quality pictures for the sidebar every week. Believe it or not, most of the significant pictures from the week are ones we've already seen and are discussing. If you think there's one we probably haven't seen, there is a link on the sidebar for submitting sidebar pics to us for consideration, please use that instead."	t5_2qmg3	True

Kinda weird how things work out, right?

 You lose two Super Bowls by last second FGs, made by the same kicker, while you were in two different teams. And one final game and *that* guy, helps you get another one.

***2012 Season Analysis***
***
**General**

* Before training camp, Vikings fans had only a few things to be optimistic about following a dismal 3-13 season. First, sophomore QB Christian Ponder would have his first full training camp, hopefully leaving him more prepared for the season. Secondly, GM Rick Spielman did what was widely considered a very good job in the draft, fleecing Cleveland while moving back one spot and still getting Matt Kalil, their target and then trading back up to the first round to pick Harrison Smith to help what was an abysmal secondary. He also picked up two WRs in the 4th round, who, along with free agent signings Jerome Simpson and John Carlson, fans hoped would give Ponder better options in the passing game. With CB Antoine Winfield returning from injury to bolster the secondary, and reports on Adrian Peterson claiming he was ahead of schedule, many fans predicted the Vikings would be in the 6-7 win range.
* During training camp, reports on Peterson’s fast recovery continued, giving fans hope he would return towards the beginning of the season. Toby Gerhart, who filled in acceptably for Peterson after his injury the previous year, was expected to be the main back for the start of the season. Meanwhile, two receiving targets distinguished themselves in training camp: Kyle Rudolph, a second year TE, and Greg Childs, a 2012 4th round WR. Unfortunately, Childs tore both of his patellar tendons, and missed the entire 2012 season. Something that surprised fans was when the Vikings cut longtime K Ryan Longwell in favor of rookie 6th rounder Blair Walsh. Longwell had lost some range over the years, but was still considered very accurate, as opposed to Walsh, who had struggled mightily during his senior season at Georgia.
* In the first game of the season, the Vikings played the Jaguars. Before the game, it was announced that AP would play, but everyone expected Toby Gerhart to get most of the carries. We were wrong, as Peterson rushed for 84 yards and 2 TDs about 8 months after having surgery to repair a torn ACL and MCL. The Vikings had the lead late in the game, but gave it up with about 30 seconds to go. Ponder was able to successfully lead the team down the field to let Walsh kick a 55 yard FG to tie the game, and subsequently kick the game-winner in OT. This validated the front office’s choice to let Longwell go and trust the rookie kicker.
* In the third game of the season, the Vikings faced the heavily favored San Francisco 49ers. This game was a coming out party for Rudolph, who showcased his red zone ability with two TDs. [Ponder also played well](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1420527/ponderHAM.gif), and fans became very optimistic about the future of the team. It should also be noted that Percy Harvin was shaping up as the star of the Vikings offense, as his ability to make people miss made him nearly impossible to cover on screen plays.
* After beating both Detroit and Tennessee, the Vikings, [especially Ponder](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1556313/LOLPONDER.gif), played poorly in their next stretch of games, losing 5 of 7 and leading many fans to call for Joe Webb to replace him. Losing Harvin to injury against the Seahawks in week 9 only magnified their problems, as Ponder could hardly do anything passing without him. That’s when Adrian Peterson put the team on his back.
* Starting in week 7, AP rushed for over 100 yards in 8 consecutive games, including two games where he broke 200, averaging over 164 yards/game. When you see how poorly the Vikings played in the passing game during that stretch, you realize that Peterson was facing teams that *knew* he was going to run. Couple that with the fact that he had had major reconstructive knee surgery less than a year before, and he looks superhuman.
* Ponder picked up his play a little, and the Vikings had won three straight (including games against the Texans and the Bears) heading in to the last week of the season. With the Bears winning earlier that day, the scenario was simple: beat the Packers and make the playoffs, or lose and go home for the offseason. Peterson was 207 yards from the single season rushing record. In a thrilling game that didn’t see much defense, the Vikings had the ball at the end of the game, with the score tied. At the Packers 37, just inside FG range, with 23 seconds to go, Peterson ripped off a 26 yard run to set up an easy game winning field goal, but leaving himself short of the rushing record by 8 yards.
* The Vikings faced the Packers again the next week in the Wild Card round, and it was announced shortly before the game that Ponder would be sidelined with an injury and Joe Webb, who fans had been calling for to replace Ponder for a good chunk of the season, would start instead. Webb [played terribly](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1959123/matthewsack.gif), making [numerous poor decisions](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1958919/ohwebb.gif) and [throwing wildly](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1958899/lolwebb.gif), and the Vikings lost, 24-10.

**Highs**

* Peterson’s [amazing comeback](http://cdn3.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1267619/allday.gif). He finished second all time on the single season rushing list, won MVP, and played the last 3 games of the regular season with a sports hernia, still rushing for almost 500 yards.
* Percy Harvin [played amazingly well](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1510369/harvinHOF.gif) in the first half of the season
* Blair Walsh set a NFL record for field goals over 50 yards, going 10/10
* The wins weeks 3 and 17 against the 49ers and Packers
* Preventing the Texans from scoring a TD week 16
* Peterson, Walsh, Rudolph, Jerome Felton, Matt Kalil, and Chad Greenway making the Pro Bowl. Rudolph was Pro Bowl MVP.
* Harrison Smith’s and Antoine Winfield’s roles in a much improved secondary.
* The Vikings went 4-2 in the NFC North. They were 0-6 last season, so this is a huge improvement.
* Going 4-0 the last 4 games of the season against the most difficult schedule in the NFL.
* The offensive line really meshed, (with the exception of Fusco) going a very good job in both run blocking and pass protection.
* Jared Allen had a slightly down year, but Brian Robison emerged as a great starter opposite of him, batting down balls and causing pressure often despite battling injuries most of the year. Everson Griffen also played very well at DE in relief of Robison.

**Lows**

* The 7 game stretch that saw 5 losses, especially the ones to the Packers and Bears, division rivals.
* Jasper Brinkley played really poorly at MLB, as he was unable to be effective in coverage, something that is required of a Tampa-2 MLB.
* Bill Musgrave’s playcalling decisions were often questionable at best, as he often completely ignore Peterson in the second half, and didn’t seem to call plays that put Ponder (or Webb in the Wild Card game) in the position to thrive.
* The Wild Card game: Webb’s poor performance showed that he is simply not capable of being an NFL QB.
* Drama surrounding Percy Harvin. During the offseason, it was reported that Harvin demanded a trade because he felt the Vikings weren’t using him to his full potential. Harvin had not been used as often as many thought he should have been the season before. The coaches talked to him, and the issue was quickly resolved. It seemed to go away as Harvin thrived in an increased role. Then, Harvin injured his ankle and because frustrated with his slow recovery. He eventually blew up and got into an argument with Leslie Fraiser, the head coach, resulting in his placement on Injured Reserve. Recently, it has been reported that the Vikings are looking to trade Harvin and that Harvin will hold out if he does not get a new contract. However, GM Rick Spielman has publicly stated he does not want to trade Harvin. Fans can only hope to get a resolution to this conflict soon, as Harvin is an extremely talented player.

I'm sure most will agree that free agency will play a huge role in the positions we want our teams to focus on in the draft. 

For a hometown example, if Miami lands Jennings/Wallace/Bowe, loses Jake Long, Reggie, and/or Sean Smith, I would want our draft broad to look much different than if we didn't have those moves happen. 

Would love to hear what you guys think.

1359139929.0	179pdq	What do Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, and Matt Schaub have in common? They all have at least seven times the average rush yards per game of Dan Marino. But Marino is only second least of all time, who has the least? Find out in in today's Salute to the Worst Running QBs of All Time.	LinuxFreeOrDie	1223	245	148	"With new dynamic playmakers like RGIII, Cam Newton, Colin Kaepernick, and Russell Wilson coming into the league, we might be seeing the end of an era. A era of really slow, unathletic white guys standing in the pocket and trying desperately to find the open man even though there are 20 yards of open grass in front of them.

It's true, in the Championship game we just saw Tom Brady throw a [desperation pass on fourth and four](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=i_kLQqXb8-0#t=462s) instead of make a run for an easy first. Well, easy for someone who could run the 40 yard dash in less than five seconds maybe. Not to mention how he was awkwardly [tackled by the ref](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000128903/Brady-runs-into-ref). Yes I remember Matt Schaub throwing a [hopeless pick to end the game against Oakland](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQMK89xsbXA) instead of running into the wide open field. On a second watching, he never would have made it, Matt Giordano closes on him in seconds, he looks literally twice as fast as Schaub. We all know how fleet of foot [Peyton Manning](http://i.imgur.com/2ENvk.png) is.

So while it seems like everyone is drafting QBs who can make people miss in the open field, we still have some great embarrassing attempts at running to watch until those three Titans of slowness retire. However we have hardly been in a golden age of slowness. Tom Brady, despite the fact that it looks like he's intentionally running slow in his combine 40 yard dash, has *five times* had an individual season where he out ran Dan Marino's career mark. So today, while we stand perhaps on the verge of a new era of athletes under center, let us look back with pride at some of the slowest, most clumsy playcallers of all time.

We'll look at the three slowest, worst runners in history, but let's first take a look at the most memorable single moment of slowness. RGIII dazzled onlookers and defenders alike with his running ability this year, including a 76 yard touchdown run earlier this year. But before there was RGIII - there was Steve Bono. For those who don't remember, Steve Bono was best known as Joe Montana's backup. He backed him and / or Young from 1989-1993 in SF. He was then traded to KC to once again backup Montana. Unlike Montana and Young however he was known as a slow footed pocket statue, rushing for a paltry 2.9 yards per game (Peyton has 3.3 for comparison).

Despite all that, in week five of his first full season starting in 1995, Steve Bono set a then record with an [equally dazzling 76 yard scamper](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjQI9Xzivv8). Although the most dazzling part of course was Arizona's defense, because while it's true Bono had yet to run a single bootleg up until that point in the year, they might have wanted to cover it a little better than that. According to a Sports Illustrator interview, Bono had a feeling how well they would be fooled though [\[1\]](http://www.arrowheadpride.com/2009/6/26/925978/the-greatest-kansas-city-chiefs-by):

&gt;Even more amazing than the run was what Bono had said in the huddle after receiving the play from the sideline. Convinced that the play-action bootleg would burn Cardinal coach Buddy Ryan's aggressive defense, Bono, who normally exudes the personality of a tackling dummy during games, told his stunned teammates, ""Guys, I'm taking it to the house.""

So Steve Bono, today we salute you! Your 76 yard run will forever live as the easiest long touchdown run anyone has ever gotten. We salute you in that you were *so* slow, that the great Buddy Ryan couldn't even conceive that you would try to run and thus  didn't even bother the most cursory defense for it.

Alright, onward to the three worst runners in history, starting with the most well known, Dan Marino, who might have had the quickest release and the slowest legs ever. Although he was actually [named #7 on NFL Network's top 10 mobile QBs of all time](http://www.nfl.com/nflnetwork/story?id=09000d5d8089c108&amp;template=with-video&amp;confirm=true), due his great ability to move around and avoid pressure, Dan Marino is often thought of as the prototype of a pure passer. Dan Marino passed for 61,361 yards (2nd all time), and yet he only managed to get 87 rushing yards in his entire 17 year career. That's an astounding 728:1 ratio, and only 0.4 yards per game on average. I've heard many Texan's fans complain about Matt Scaub's dismal running abilities, but in comparison he has a 66:1 passing to rushing ratio, and 2.8 yards per game in. Mike Vick has a 3.6:1 ratio and 46 yards per game, in case anyone was wondering. Dan Marino essentially *never* ran. I scoured the internet for hours of visual evidence that he ever did, but was unable to find anything. There were even some full games on YouTube, but even with that the odds are pretty low of witnessing the rarest of rare Dan Marino rushing yard. There's move video of Bigfoot on youtube than Dan Marino running. So Dan Marino, we salute you! Your 87 rushing yards makes Peyton, with his 728, look like Steve McNair. I can only imagine how many times in your long and storied career the whole field opened up before you and everyone in the stands was screaming for you to run, for you to only zip the ball downfield for a longer pass than you would have gotten if you took off.

Next up at number two: Ken Stabler. Now, Ken Stabler was no Dan Marino, he was a decent athlete. In fact he rushed for 838 yards and 9 touchdowns in his three year college career. And unlike Dan Marino, I was able to find a pretty good run by him in [the Immaculate Reception game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Fbca0EncfW4#t=11s), and while he doesn't exactly look like Cam Newton, he moves pretty well. But he has to be included due to his incredible career rushing stats. That 30 yard run was by far his longest, and in fact not counted in his rushing stats since it happened in the playoffs. In the regular season he only ever managed to rush for 93 yards in 13 years, 0.5 a game. Now on the surface those stats look better than Marino's, but the really incredible thing about Stabler's stats is that out of those 93 yards, *101* of them came in 1973. That's right, if you remove 1973 Ken Stabler had -8 career rushing yards, quite a remarkable feat for someone who did in fact have legs attached to his body. So Ken Stabler, we salute you, in particular your amazing total of -60 rushing yards from 1974 to 1984, with not a single year in the positive, is a feat not likely to soon be passed! May you serve as an inspiration to people who just don't want to run everywhere.

And now, the worst runner in history: Norman ""The Dutchman"" Van Brocklin. Presumably most people here aren't very familiar with The Dutchman, but [he was named #83 in NFL Film's top 100 Greatest Players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApxbHDy4wyY) (check out the sweet jump pass at 36 seconds!). He was a 9x pro bowler, and lead two teams to championships, the Rams in 1951 and the Eagles in 1960 (the Eagle's most recent, maybe they should go back to pocket passers!). But Norman Van Brocklin is perhaps best known for passing for a record 554 yards in a single game, a record that incredibly still stands today. And yet in his 13 year career he only amassed 40 rushing yards, an incredible 0.3 per game. That means he passed for 13.85 times more yards in a single game than he ran for in his entire career. Clearly The Dutchman didn't think running was in his job description, Sonny Jurgensen even has an anecdote about Norman yelling at him for trying to run in the NFL Films piece. Wikipedia says this about his coaching career:

&gt;On January 18, 1961, he accepted the head coaching position for the expansion Minnesota Vikings and over the next six years Van Brocklin compiled a record of 29-51-4. The tenure was highlighted by his contentious relationship with quarterback Fran Tarkenton. Van Brocklin was displeased with Tarkenton's penchant for scrambling, preferring that he stay in the pocket.

All in all, it's pretty clear how he thought the position should be played. So Norman Van Brocklin, we salute you! The original and best, and perhaps the purest pocket passer ever. You set the template for slow footed, terrible athletes to succeed in the NFL for generations to come!

Thank you to the knights of new, who downvote, report, and message us about inappropriate content. It helps a lot. Thank you to those who posts game threads, those who spirit civil and well mannered discussions, and those who posts excellent content to /r/nfl. 11 months ago, we were celebrating 40k users. Now, we are nearly up to 140k and it's because of you guys. From the preseason to post season and beyond, you make /r/nfl what it is and it has been our pleasure to moderate such a great community.

I'd also like to thank you for making superbowl sunday so quiet. Of course we removed threads which didn't belong, but not much more than an average NFL sunday. [Here is the user activity from Sunday.](http://i.imgur.com/PvAOf5z.png)

###Questions and Anwsers

Many people have questions about the offseason and /r/nfl. We'll try our best to answer them here.

**What do we normally discuss here during the offseason?**

The offseason might not be as exciting as the regular season, but there is still a lot of news coming out of the NFL world. Between retirement announcements, staff moves, free agency, combine, the draft and more, there is plenty to post and discuss.

**Now that there is no more NFL, what am I to do now?**

Outside of other sports, there is the offensive heavy Arena Football. I know what your thinking but trust us, it's better than sitting on your couch wishing for football. Check out /r/arenafootball for more details on that. There is also /r/NFL_Draft, which will have a lot of discussion about the upcoming NFL draft.

**When will the flair un-fade?**

We un-fade all the flair at the draft. The Baltimore Ravens trophy flair will stay until training camp, however.


Edit: In the interest of fairness we'll be removing the Lombardi trophy from Ravens flair at the start of the NFL draft, as we did with Giants flair last year.


Have an unanswered question? Post it here and we will try our best to answer it.

If he has less than 5 completed passes and they still win, going to AHA. (As of 3:40PM)

Still looking for someone to match on Broncos side.

***2012 Season Analysis***
***
**General**

*Preseason*

•	The major offseason move for the Bills was the major FA signings on d-line.  We signed Mario Williams to a six-year, $96 million contract, the deal had $50 million guaranteed.   Following Mario, we also picked up Mark Anderson from the Patriots following his 10 sack break out season.  He signed a four-year, $19.5 million contract with $8 million guaranteed.  When paired with Marcell Dareus and Kyle Williams, the Bills were heading into the season with one of the most hyped up defensive lines of the entire league.
  
•	In the draft the Bills were able to truly shore up some positions of need.  The team, last year, had drafted AJ Williams as a CB hoping to hit 2nd round gold.  The struck bronze and he did not play as well as expected.  With Terence McGee on his last leg (literally) and Wild Card Leodis Mckelvin, the team was in dire need of some talent at the position.  So they drafted Stephon Gilmore who took the starting #1 corner position coming out of training camp.  Along with Gilmore, Cordy Glenn fell into the Bills lap during the 2nd round.  Buddy Nix was quoted as saying, “Hell no he’s not a guard.. He started 50 games and the last 16 were at left tackle. We put it out there and tried to spread the rumour that he was a guard to hope somebody wouldn’t take him.""  It was phenomenal pick for the team that needed one more piece in the o-line to really come together as a good unit.  Our third round pick was the project TJ Graham.  Considered a deep threat with some extreme raw talent, TJ ran track in College and was supposed to stretch the field for the Bills to allow Stevie Johnson to work the middle where he is most effective.  Following Graham was Nigel Bradahm.  He was a middle linebacker at FSU who is hard and brutal hitter.  [Bonus vicious yet legal hit at FSU](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=MGYwJaqIzLU#t=83s)  Finally in the 5th round the Bills took Ron Brooks, a kid who sat behind Morris Claiborne and Patrick Peterson for 3 years at LSU.  Talk about a bad break, but he slid to the Bills here.  The rest of the picks had no impact on the team except for our 7th round Kicker Josh Potter who was released after 6 games -_-

•	We signed Vince Young but cut him after it was found out he owed lots of money and took out loans to throw $300,000 birthday parties for himself.

•	The addition of the highly hyped Dave Wannstedt as our new Defensive Coordinator, along with Stephon Gilmore, Mario Williams, Mark Anderson, Dareus, Kyle Williams, Nick Barnett, and Jarius Byrd the Bills defense finally looked like it was ready for a break out year.  We could not have been more wrong (I place the blame on a miserable washed up coach whose scheme did nothing to maximize anything).  On the offensive side of the ball, the Bills were looking to make the big step forward; Fitz had a full offseason under his belt as the starter.  Stevie had help on the outside, Fred Jackson and CJ were supposed to dominate and Cordy Glen looked like he could be a 12 year starter at left tackle.  
•	We had hope.  
***

*The 2012 Season review*

• Jets 48 – Bills 28 All hope was lost.  Fred Jackson out for at least 6 games with a knee injury and Mark Sanchez stat line: 19-27 3 TD 1 Int.  [Abandon season]( http://i.imgur.com/L08ao.gif)


•	The chiefs and browns wins were rather empty knowing we had to face the Patriots and 49ers. But CJ Spiller was our [bright spot](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-fantasy/0ap2000000065339/QB-Fitzpatrick-to-RB-Spiller-32-yd-pass-TD) He was the first player to average at least 10  per carry through the first two games since Jim Brown.  Then against the Browns, in the 1st Quarter after having 58 total yards went down with a shoulder injury and was out for the rest of the game.  


•	I will pretend that I blacked out the next two weeks.  We lost 28-52 to the Patriots and 45-3 to the 49ers. 


•	One note of importance- the Bills were up 7-21 during the 3rd quarter.  The Pats proceeded to put up 45 points following that along with some [vacuum pizzas]( http://i.imgur.com/nGnNy.gif) when the score was tied. 


•	Who are the 49ers?


•	On to the Arizona OT win, one major highlight of the season was Alex “Megahand” Carrington.  He blocked 3 field goals and 1 extra point. Bruce Smith had 4 for the record in a season.  We needed him to block the possible game winning field goal after allowing a 61 yarder to tie the game and then going 3 and out to allow a 39 yard attempt in the closings seconds.  The Bills somehow scrape together for a win. 


•	In Arizona, Jairus Byrd showed how much we need to re-sign him; at this point he had 5 forced turnovers and is proving he is just a dominant Free Safety. 


•	Matt Hassleback contemplating retirement leads his team to victory in with a dominant drive to put the Titans up by 1 for the win.  I hate life.


•	Our defense decides that stopping the run is optional for these few weeks, allowing 247, 311, 182 and then 197 to the Pats, 49ers, Cardinals and Titans. My head explodes during bye week wondering if life is better as a Houston Oilers fan.  


•	We lose to the Texans and Patriots again.  Over the past 4 games CJ has 12, 12, 6, 9 carries respectively.  WOW this guy must suck right he must have a negative yards per average rush to be earning such little carries. Oh, he had a 7.33, 5.83, 6.50 and 7.78 Y/A.  It was here that most people moved on from Chan as a head coach.  He couldn’t manage a game and insisted on Brad Smith at crucial points of the game.  Brad would come in, throw a pick or lose yards.  The amount of talent on both sides of the ball here is more than average but Dave Wanny and Chan wasted it with embarrassing game plans and an inability to be aggressive.  


•	The Bills are a 3-6 with a near impossible schedule to start the season.  But starting with Miami the Bills had a supposed much easier schedule and were looking to run the table.   They are facing Miami, Indy, the Jags, Rams, Seattle, Miami again, and finally the Jets, who following the offensive dysentery they had on us, opening day, seemed to have no offense left in the tank for the rest of the league.  The most optimistic of us were looking at a 10-6 season. The sane ones were looking at 9-7 and realistically 8-8 with that schedule.  The pessimists were scouting college QBs and hoping to lose out.


•	We beat Miami on Thursday Night Football.  I got blackout drunk at the stadium.  It was a blast.  Leodis McKelvin saved our butts with the only Bills touchdown, Rian Lindell Mr. Automatic under 50 yards hit 4 fields goals due to being Fitzpatrick unable to lead the team. Score 19-14. Things are looking up. 


•	We face Andrew Luck.  It should be the CJ show.  He had 25 touches in Miami with 125 total yards and it looks like Chan is finally recognizing the keys to winning.  In Indy, CJ had 107 yards. Wow he must have had a solid game with like 25 or 30 touches.  Nope. 14 rushing attempts with a 7.64 average.  I want someone to rip my spinal cord out a la [subzero]( http://media.tumblr.com/d302b20bfd1d11995c0f63d1e4cabe9d/tumblr_inline_mf931uoWVg1qkdu80.gif).   Fitz and Chan seal their own fate in this game IMO.  Chan’s play calling was Fitz throw twice and CJ run once. It was so predictable I wanted to vomit.   Fitz was having trouble hitting anything past 7 yards and down by 7 points, he throws a pick that gets intercepted.  Our season is looks like it’s going down the drain, then Stevie comes up and strips the fella who picked off the ball and we get it back.  The ball is on the 50 and things are looking great for us to tie it up, 4 minutes left.  1st down, Fitz gets 6 on a QB run. 2-4, Chan calls his 800th screen of the day we lose 4 yards.  We throw it again on 3-8, incomplete; Fitz wouldn’t be able to hit water if he was skipping stones into Lake Erie. We punt on the 50 yard line and Luck runs out the clock. Game Lost.


•	We beat the Jags ^whooooooooooo 


•	If the Arizona game was Fitz and Chan’s downfall, the pitiful effort during the St. Louis game was the 8 feet of dirt being piled on the coffin.  The defense was stout (just like the beer that I drink too much of) the whole game except for the final drive.  Freddy had 14 touches along with one fumble; CJ had 7 touches with no fumbles.  Chan went with the hot hand right? Wrong, Freddy had 30 yards while CJ had 52.  That’s about 2 yards per touch vs. 7.5.  I charted our play by play…its maddening.  I color coded it so you guys know can enjoy what it’s like to watch the Bills offense this year.  Blue is CJ touching the ball, puke yellow is Fitz touching the ball and puke green is Freddy touching the ball.  [Offensive Plays](http://i.imgur.com/6gbxMl5.png)


•	We lose 17-50 to the Seahawks our old defense shows up =) Beast Mode, his 24 karat gold and emerald grill, and the rest of the Seahawks run for 270 yards. Russell Wilson rushes for 3 TDs and tosses another. 


•	Why did I volunteer to do this? 


•	We lose to Miami in miserable fashion.  Watching the offense is offensive. It looks nice with lots of CJ but checking the series ending downs you’ll see the true story.  Let me lay it out: 

o	2 Incompletions, CJ 5 yards

o	Incompletion, Tashard choice (&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;) -3 yards, 2 yard pass play

o	CJ 5 yards, 2 Incompletions

o	CJ twice, Completion, Halftime

o	CJ 4 yards, CJ -1 yard, Screen Play 

o	Fitz Fumble 

o	Incompletion, Brad Smith 1 yard, CJ 6 yards

o	Incompletion, End of game 

•	Here is another game log of the [offence -_-](http://i.imgur.com/OWPtHne.png)

•	Why when the Freddy hurt his leg during the end of the Rams game. So who would have guessed it, but CJ put up back to back 100 yard games, 103 vs. Seattle and 138 against the Miami with 17 and 22 carries respectively.  

•	Empty win vs. the Jets. 
Looking back, there was nothing better for the team going forward to lose those four games to the Colts, Rams, Seahawks and Dolphins.  It allowed Buddy Nix and Russ Brandon to realize the team needed a change at both the head coaching and Quarterback positions.  

*Thus Ends the Season Review*

1375752454.0	1js4zi	Final update regarding vote hiding.	NFL_Mod	1094	245	477	"After seeing how the condition meshed with a couple of our static weekly threads (one game thread, one Trash Talk Thread), we have decided to discontinue vote hiding on comments. We were aware of how the feature has been received in other subs, but as the dynamics of some of /r/nfl's most heavily trafficked posts do differ from much of Reddit at large, we wanted to see if the effects here would be any different.

When we first implemented the feature, we hoped that it would help curb a prevalence of mindless content (easy jokes, memes, etc.) that we've been seeing on the subreddit and help promote positive discussion by getting users to judge comments on their individual merit and not by just following prevalent trends. After trying this in some of the most popular thread types we'll see during the season and observing and discussing the outcomes, we have concluded that vote hiding has had no substantial effect on the types of comments that are being posted or voted to the top. We've considered merely shortening the time, but with specific deference to the nature of game threads, we have chosen to remove it.

It should be mentioned that many concerns were raised about the issue, and we have and will continue to hear them and any other constructive criticism and take them into account in the future. Every policy and change we decide on for the sub is done with an eye towards keeping this the best and most forward looking football discussion forum in the world. We sincerely appreciate your ideas and perspectives.

**2012 Season Preview**

After an amazing 15-1 regular season and an abrupt exit from the 2011 playoffs hopes were definitely high for the 2012 Packers.  The main failing of last years team, the defense, seemed to be addressed as the first 5 picks in the draft were all defensive players.  

There were two departures in Free agency betwen these seasons that really affected the Packers.  First and foremost was center Scott Wells, now playing for the Rams. In 2011 Wells anchored the middle of the line between two of the better guards in the league (Josh Sitton and T.J. Lang).  The second main departure was QB Matt Flynn who went where Green Bay tends to ship of backup quaterbacks, Seattle.  He was expected to start there until Seattle selected some other guy from Wisconsin who was supposed to be too short to play at a pro level.  

Green Bay also addressed the lack of a running game with the off-season signing of Cedric Benson.  The deal heavily favored Green Bay as Benson was signed to a one year deal at the veteran minimum.  Benson was not quite what Green Bay was hoping for as he averaged either 2.0 YPC or 4.0 YPC (with good games coming against New Orleans and Chicago).  He was enough of a threat to keep the defenses honest (after week 1) but in the week 5 game against the Colts he suffered a season ending Lisfranc injury.

**Highs**

* Aaron Rodgers continuing dominace.  It's still a surprise when he throws an interception and it seems more often than not it's not his fault when it does happen.  He did see his passer rating drop from the record 122.5 last season to a paltry 108 this season.
* Although Clay Matthews only started 12 games due to injuries, his 12 games started were more like the 2010 Clay Matthews.  He ended the season with 13.0 sacks and 1 forced fumble.
* Going 5-1 in the division.  Green Bay made a rather strong statement with their 23-10 win over the Bears in week 2.  Including that ridiculously awesome fake field goal touchdown found [here](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap1000000062020/Special-teams-trickery)
* Randall Cobb had another great year giving Green Bay comfort for Greg Jennings impending departure via free agency.  He set the franchise record for all purpose yards in a single season.
* James ""I Don't Want the Ball"" Jones completely rid himself of that nickname.  He became notable this season for talking to himself loud enough for defenders to hear him and tieing a string around his finger to remind him to catch the ball.  He went without a drop for over half the season and showed that he can be that guy we want him to be.  
* Although Green Bay RB's have been a revolving door of mediocrity, DuJuan Harris showed sparks of brillance in the playoff loss to the 49ers, gaining the respect of that vaunted defense.
* Mason Crosby had a very very lackluster season ending with a 63.6% success rate, but the last four games of the season he was perfect, including 3 makes from 40+ yards hopefully giving the Packers one less thing to worry about this offseason.
* Jermichael Finley looked like he started to return ot his form that he had against [Arizona](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/09000d5d815a5785/Wild-Card-Jermichael-Finley-highlights) a few years ago.  He ended the season on a really strong note, here's to hoping he continues it next season.
* The middle part of the offensive line seemed to solidify as soon as Jeff Saturday was replaced by Evan Dietrech-Smith.  But the tackles still need work.
* Ted Thompson once again proved his mastery at drafting players, 5/8 players seeing rather significant playing time for rookies.  Especially on defense.
* Finally, the draft picks on defense really really panned out.  Statistically the defense improved by a lot, and just eye balling it the defense did not make you uncomfortable watching them everytime they were on the field.  Rookie Casey Hayward ended the season with 6 interceptions, and although being slightly smaller than an NFL corner, was one of the better defenders in the league against the pass.  Nick Perry, although he suffered a season ending injury in week 6, showed he can be the linebacker opposite of Clay Matthews that Green Bay needs.


**Lows**

* The Packers continue to be unable to run the ball.  Although a late season reshuffling of the O-Line ended up with some good power runs behind Don Barclay, the Packers continue to flirt with the bottom third in terms of running games.
* The defensive line once again proved rather ineffective.  They continually get pushed around in the run game and rarely generate pressure on their own.  
* Lack of depth.  The Packers have no depth to speak of on OLB or DL.  ILB was ravaged by injuries to starters and backups so that group gets a pass.  As soon as Nick Perry went down there was absolutely no pass rush opposite Clay Mathews.  DL has no studs outside BJ Raji, and even he is not a super star, just a good player.  
* Week 11 loss to the New York Giants.  Even before the first quarter had ended, it was clear that the Giants had once again simply outplayed and outplanned the Packers.  Plain and simple they got manhandled.
* Division round playoff loss to the 49ers.  Another game where the opponent had their way with the Packers defense.  Although the offense was able to keep things from getting downright ugly, Colin Kaepernick did his best David Blaine impression, seemingly being invisible to the Packers defenders.  He threw for 263 yards and ran for 181 more.  It was downright embarrasing.
* The one you've all been waiting for- week 3 ""loss"" to the Seahawks.  Although they did give up 8 sacks to the monstorous Seattle defensive line, they played well enough to scrape out a win, that is until the replacement officials decided otherwise.  What probably should have been called and [interception](http://imgur.com/XKbarWL) ended with a Russell Wilson to Golden Tate touchdown pass.  Seattle wins by 2. Game over.  The Packers became the sacrifical goat at the altar of the replacement officials, and the league got lucky that playoffs were not severly affected.  This controversy was also how TJ Lang rose to Twitter fame tweeting after the game, ""Got fucked by the refs..Embarrasing. Thanks nfl."" and ""Fuck it NFL.. Fine me and use the money to pay the regular refs"".  That second tweet was retweeted over 92,000 times, setting a Twitter record.  

( I just want to make this clear, I do not blame the Seahawks players, coaches, fans, etc. for what happened in the Fail Mary game, just the replacement officials.  I harbor no ill will to you all. You're just downright scary now.)

1347746141.0	zxzle	I'm a little bit concerned by the direction of the subreddit...	JackTLogan	1665	848	612	"I think it's great that so many new people have grown interested in football and discovered what has been easily my favorite subreddit, but /r/nfl has grown so quickly and it's reaching a critical mass where it's starting to suffer from ""Large Subreddit Problems.""  

Generally what I mean by this is that more and more garbage posts are making it to the top.  Misleading titles, pictures of NFL.com typos, pictures of mundane football shit (jerseys, stadiums, Look Who I Met, etc) and general karmawhoring.

Some examples from the current front page:

* 1 - Marshall Newhouse mentions reddit on twitter.

* 2 - This is seriously a picture of Bellichick wearing an ugly sweatshirt.  Stop the presses.

* 7 - ""I was...when all of a sudden...""  This really irritates me.  No clue what the post is about until you click it and its a screencap of some bet about Jim and Jim hugging it out.  Riveting.

* 9 - this is actually a picture of a sign at an airport that mentions Cowboy Stadium.  Again no clue how mundane this is going to be until you click on it.

* 11 - This is a picture of a semi truck that is owned by the Steelers.

* 13 - I shit you not this is a picture of the 32 team logos all next to each other in a rectangle.  That's it.  Literally.  Nothing else. Fuck's sake.

Alright I can't go any further, sorry that rundown got me a little irritated, but my point is that the more people subscribe, the more bullshit like that is going to be voted up to the top, and the more thoughtful conversations and informative posts will fall through the cracks.  Like many of you, /r/nfl has been my favorite subreddit for the past few seasons, and it's pretty disappointing to me that it sometimes looks like /r/funny with shoulder pads.  

Is there realistically anything to be done to address this?  Am I blowing it out of proportion?  Has it always been like this and my memory is failing?

You will soon be watching football while you shove too many nachos and wings into your face instead of missing football while you shove too many nachos and wings into your face.  We're taking this opportunity to remind everyone of some of the core rules and principles that govern /r/nfl before the season gets started.

___
* First, we're about to tighten up what content we allow.  We're not going any further that the sub rules dictate, but in a content starved offseason, we played it a little loose with what was ""acceptable.""  If you make a post similar to something we've allowed in recent weeks and months and it gets deleted, that's likely why.  With a substantial upswing of the availability of hard news, our interpretations of what is appropriate will become more strict.

**TL;DR:** We'll be removing more posts not directly related to football news and discussion. And seriously, was that too long to read?

* Please, don't use the downvote button as an ""I disagree"" reflex twitch.  You're better than that.  If someone has a perspective at odds with yours, explain **why** you believe their argument is flawed or incomplete.  In a tone that doesn't indicate you hate yourself and all of humanity, if possible.  Seriously, present your counter argument.  Just trying to bury an alternative perspective or getting angry and belligerent fixes nothing.  It just pollutes the forum.  Calmly explain why you disagree.  You don't need to mute those having differing opinions.

**TL;DR:** Don't downvote something just because you disagree with someone's opinion.

* But there's another side to this coin.  If you present an opinion, even a valid and well defended one, but do so in completely dicktacular fashion, don't be surprised if you do get downvoted.  Upvotes are for comments that contribute to the discussion, downvotes are for comments that take from it.  Even a valid argument, when wrapped in mockery, hostility, arrogance, or contempt, HURTS THE DISCUSSION.  You're not necessarily getting downvoted because of what you say.  Consider how you say it.

**TL;DR:** Don't be surprised or feel bullied if your opinion gets downvotes when you put it in a brash or superior voice.

* On the topic of hostility, and this is a simple one, good natured trash talk is one thing, but harassing or insulting individuals or team fan bases is unacceptable.  When you see it, report it.  Do it too much, and you won't be welcome here.

**TL;DR:** Don't go around insulting individuals or team fan bases. Chronic offenders will earn the boot.

1372172486.0	1h1gsh	Jay Cutler in Chicago vs. Ryan Fitzpatrick in Buffalo -- an in-depth comparison	Bruce_G	1047	268	680	"I was reading an article about Steven Jackson when it mentioned that he played with Ryan Fitzpatrick while he was with the Rams back in 2005.  After immediately thinking *Jesus tits, Fitzpatrick is surprisingly old!* I went to look up his stats to see where he'd bounced around before catching on with the Bills.  His numbers were a little better than I thought they would be, and upon further investigation I discovered that his passing stats over the past four years in Buffalo are eerily similar to another prominent QB's stats during that same period:

|Player      |Year   |Starts|Att   |Cmp%|TDs|TD% |INT|INT%|Y/A|Rating|
|:-----:    |:-----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:--:|:---:|:--:|:---:|:--:|:----:|
|Cutler      |'09-'12|56     |1735|59.6%|82  |4.7%|63  |3.6%|7.1|81.9   |
|Fitzpatrick|'09-'12|52     |1742|59.8%|80  |4.6%|64  |3.7%|6.7|79.8   |

That's a damn near identical performance (and note that both QBs have been with the same team for all four years), save for Cutler's ability to push the ball down the field a bit better (higher Y/A).  This got me thinking -- **Why do we think of Fitzpatrick as a has-been (or never-was) when we think of Cutler as a talented QB in a bad offense?**

Well, maybe it's because Cutler's a better scrambler.  Is he?

|Player      |Year   |Rush Att|Rush Yds|Rush Y/A|Fumbles|Fumbles/Start|
|:--------:|:-----:|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|:------:|:------------:|
|Cutler      |'09-'12|149      |693        |4.7        |34       |0.61             |
|Fitzpatrick|'09-'12|175      |822        |4.7        |26       |0.50             |

From their identical Y/A they appear to have similar running ability, although Fitzpatrick is able to maintain that level of efficiency over a few more carries.  Fitz also fumbles less.  Perhaps he looks better here because he's playing in front of a better offensive line:

|Player|Year  |Sacks + Groundings|Dropbacks|ASR|
|:----:|:----:|:-----------------:|:--------:|:--:|
|Cutler|'09-'12|184                     |2175       |8.5%|
|Fitzpatrick|'09-'12|133               |2138       |6.2%|

Adjusted Sack Rate -- ASR -- is a [Football Outsiders](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/ol2009) stat that measures how often a QB is sacked or forced into an intentional grounding penalty when he drops back.  From '09-'12 ASR typically ranges from around 3.5% to around 9.5%, with 6.4% being very close to both the average and the median each year.  From these numbers it looks like Fitzpatrick has played behind roughly a typical O-line during his time in Buffalo while Cutler has perennially suffered behind turnstiles in Chicago, and this seems to be intuitively correct.  Keep in mind, though, that QBs can avoid sacks by throwing the ball away, scrambling, adjusting protection, changing the play, etc. -- and that sometimes [taking a sack is by far the best option.](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18amb69xjthfggif/ku-xlarge.gif)

We know the quality of one's team affects a QB's play, too -- let's take a look at that:

|Team|Year|Rush YPG|Rush Y/A|Rush Rank|Def YPG|Def Y/P|D Rank (Yds)|#1 WR Yds|
|:--:|:-----:|:--------:|:-------:|:------:|:------:|:-----:|:----------:|:----------:|
|Bears|'09-'12|110.8      |4.1     |17.5|329.5|5.1       |12.0          |988     |
|Bills|'09-'12|120.7        |4.7     |13.3|359.0|5.5       |22.8          |988     |

The Bills have rushed for 10 more yards/game, but the Bears have given up 30 fewer yards on defense.  That's a net 20 YPG advantage toward the Bears -- two extra crucial first downs every game, every year, for four years.  ""#1 WR Yds"" is the average production of each team's leading receiver for each year; a quick-and-dirty way of measuring the competency of each squad's WRs.  Neither team had much in the way of WRs in '09, Buffalo probably had a slightly superior group in '10 and '11, and the addition of Brandon Marshall clearly elevated Chicago's group in '12.  I'd say that's roughly a push, and the numbers back that up.

A few other notes:

* *Strength of schedule:*  I don't know of anywhere to find the record of each team's opponents, but I'm assuming over four seasons they'll end up about the same.
* *Injuries:*  Injuries to one's teammates can harm a QB's performance, but because injuries are mostly random from year-to-year I'm assuming the injury rate of each team will be about the same over four seasons.
* *Why just the last four years?*  Both QBs started roughly the same number of games on the same team over the last four years, and more recent seasons are probably more relevant to how a QB will perform in the future.

**TL:DR:**  So [what does it all mean, Basil?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfYBsuBzulE)  In short, [Fitzpatrick and Cutler aren't that different.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20B4Dvk_9cY)  Cutler pushes the ball down the field a bit better, but Fitz is a more productive scrambler (and less likely to fumble).  Fitz plays with a better O-line, but Cutler plays with a better defense.  Neither has had great WRs to work with, and both have struggled with interceptions.  **All things considered, we give Cutler too much credit and Fitzpatrick too little.**

**EDIT:**  Thanks for the responses -- this is a great discussion.  A few comments on some recurring themes:

* **How much does an O-line help/hurt a QB?**  Not as much as you probably think.  Take a look at this (dated) [FO article on sack rates for different QBs on the same team.](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2003/fun-sacks-part-ii)  Even though QBs play behind the same O-line in the same season, their sack rates can vary greatly.  This indicates that the QB is a significant contributor to his own protection.
* **How much does defense help/hurt a QB?**  One major way defense influences offense is starting field position.  [The average LOS at the start of a drive](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/drivestats2009) varied significantly between the Bears and the Bills from '09-'12.  With an average starting LOS on the 30.78, the Bears led the league in starting position twice, placed in the top-5 three times, and averaged a rank of 7.5.  The Bills -- at 28.14 -- only sniffed the top-10 one year and averaged a rank of 19.75.  [This amount of difference in starting LOS does matter.](http://www.advancednflstats.com/2007/09/importance-of-field-position.html)  The QB has to do less to win and can therefore be more conservative in close situations.
* **Coaching:**  Cutler has had three OCs (Turner, Martz, Tice) during his time in Chicago and one HC.  Fitz had two OCs (Van Pelt, Modkins) and three HCs (Jauron, Fewell, Gailey) in Buffalo.  Cutler's OCs tended to be more experienced and came with more past success -- Martz's offenses in St. Louis and Detroit finished in the top-10 in passing yards for nine years straight (including seven straight top-5 years), Tice coached four top-10 passing offenses in Minnesota (including two top-5 years), and Ron Turner at least had a decade of coordinator experience in Chicago.  Van Pelt and Modkins, meanwhile, had no prior NFL experience (according to Pro Football Reference) and Gailey had only coached two top-10 passing offenses in a dozen NFL seasons.  Whether Cutler's coaching was better suited to him is a subjective question, but he objectively had more pedigreed and more experienced coaches and coordinators.
* **Cutler ""looks"" better:**  I have a tough time putting much stock in the eye test when you have four years of player performance to compare.  I could care less if Jacoby Ellsbury *looks* like he steals the most bases, or if Lebron *looks* like he makes the most shots, or if Jimmy Johnson *looks* like the poorest and stupidest driver.  Who is actually the most successful at each of these pursuits?  Stats are a great way to objectively answer this question, and are particularly useful when you have a sample size of nearly half a decade.  I'm not too hung up on who has the stronger arm or seems to move better in the pocket -- we've already seen the extent to which those qualities will help each player.  These QBs are halfway into their pro careers; I think it's more important to discuss what we know they can do in a realistic environment than to speculate as to what they could do in an ideal situation."	t5_2qmg3	True

1. Every time Bill Belichick’s emotionless face is shown, drink

2. Every time they mention Torrey Smith’s brother, drink and pour out a drink. RESPECT

3. Every time they show Phil Simms ~~ugly face~~, drink

4. Every time they talk about Ray Lewis’s legacy, drink

5. Every time they mention Rob Ninkovich, drink

6. Every time a touchdown is scored, drink

7. *CHALLENGE CHALLENGE*: whenever a coach challenges a ruling on the field, predict what the outcome will be. If you are incorrect, finish your drink. If you are correct, laugh at those who failed. Participation is **mandatory**

8. *TIMEOUT CHALLENGE*: whenever a timeout is called, finished your drink before the timeout ends. Whoever finishes first gets to make a rule. Participation is **not mandatory**. 

9. *FIELD GOAL CHALLENGE*: whenever a field goal is about to be attempted, call whether or not the attempt will be successful. Guess incorrectly and finish your drink. Guess correctly and laugh at those who failed. Participation is **mandatory**

10. Every time there is a turnover, drink. Oh Tom Brady threw an interception? Drink for 10 seconds. 

11. *GRONK CHALLENGE*: oh, they mentioned Robert’s injury? Pick 2 people to play 4 cup flip cup. The players must spike their cups once they finish. Whoever wins gets to make a new rule, whoever loses finishes their drink. 

12.*NAS CHALLENGE* : you know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, ITS HALFTIME! The 4 players that drank the least during the first half play a friendly game of beerpong. The winners get to make a rule. The losers must fetch drinks/food/whatever for everyone else the remainder of the football game. 

13.*WELKER CHALLENGE*: Before the game decide whether you want to drink every time Wes Welker catches a pass for a first down or catches a pass that does not result in a first down. Participation is **mandatory**

 My wife was one of his teachers and she worked with the Mother of the boy who had cancer. His mother talked about crying so hard and long that she physically ran out of tears. It was the darkest time in all of our lives.

The boy goes through with his treatment and who shows up at the hospital...Vince MOTHER FUCKIN' Wilfork!

No camera crews, no publicity, no Nike commercials. Just a big ass smile and some words of encouragement.

It's with great amazement that the doctors were able to treat the cancer and he is now cancer free and doing great.

To this day, I can't express how much that meant to everyone.

The Redskins gave their 1st round pick in 2013 to The Rams in the blockbuster trade that landed them RGIII. 

The Redskins traded Albert Haynesworth to The Patriots for a 5th round pick. 

The Redskins originally traded QB Donovan McNabb for a 2012 6th round pick which turned out to be RB Alfred Morris and a conditional 6th round pick in 2013 but McNabb didn't meet the minimum playing time requirements in Minnesota so The Vikings will not send their 2013 6th round pick back to The Redskins. 
 
The Redskins traded Kevin Barnes to The Lions for a conditional pick but those conditions were not met so The Lions will not be returning that pick back to The Redskins either. In addition, The Redskins will not receive any compensatory picks in this years draft.

**2012 Season Overview**

* The Redskins off-season story:

The Redskins ended 2011 with a 5-11 record and desperately needing a replacement for their two subpar quarterbacks. John Beck could only complete passes to the RB, and Rex Grossman could only complete passes to Safeties.

With the 6th overall pick in 2012, the Redskins had their eyes set on RG3 or Matt Barkley. When Barkley decided to stay for his senior year (as did Landry Jones from OU), that substantially increased the price for RG3. The Redskins ponied up, trading their 2012 1st and 2nd round picks, as well as 2013 and 2014's 1st round picks. Mike Shanahan was entering his third season as head coach with only an 11-21 record, so he effectively bet his career on one player.

In the preseason, offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan kept his cards close to the chest, having RG3 attempt only 31 passes, the majority of which came from under center. There were rumors that Kyle Shanahan was trying to work in some plays from the Baylor playbook to help RG3's transition, but the infamous RG3-Alfred Morris pistol formation was still completely unseen.
The RB battle was fairly split, with Roy Helu and Evan Royster having multiple 100-yd games as rookies in 2011, and Tim Hightower attempting a comeback after a Week 5 ACL tear from the prior year. Alfred Morris got the most carries in the preseason though, so the position was completely in the air.
Two of the biggest offseason signings were WR Pierre Garcon and WR Josh Morgan. They were competing with Redskins fan favorite Santana Moss, high-potential sophomore receiver Leonard Hankerson, and small, speedy Aldrick Robinson.

The Redskins' largest concerns entering Week 1 were the offensive line and the secondary. Other than LT Trent Williams, everyone else on the offensive line was a free agent fill-in with rookie backups. New free agent pickup FS Tanard Jackson was out for the year with a drug-related suspension, and free agent pickup SS Brandon Meriweather was out for the first three games due to injury.

Just prior to the start of free agency The Redskins were slammed with a 36$ million cap penalty by the NFL for overspending on contracts in the 2010 un-capped year. They were forced to take the hit in cap space which was to be split over the 2012 and 2013 seasons cutting 18$ million each year. This limited The Redskins options in free-agency as they were simply unable to afford the talent they needed in key positions. To general manager Bruce Allen's credit however, The Redskins were able to re-sign several key players and bring in the best talent available with the cap space they had to work with. 

* The Redskins storybook 2012 season:

Despite the enormous cap penalty and lack of depth in the secondary The Redskins ended their 2012 regular season 10-6 handing The Dallas Cowboys a loss in-front of an ecstatic home crowd in what was essentially the NFC EAST Championship Game. They had also solved their quarterback woes with QB Robert Griffin III leading the team to their first division title since 1999 throwing for 20 TD’s to 5 INT’s with a 65.6 completion % and 3,200 yards good for a 102.4 QB rating on the year.  He also added 815 yards on the ground with 7 rushing TD’s earning himself a Pro-Bowl invitation and the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year Award. 

RGIII was the story of the year but fellow rookies Alfred Morris, RB and Kirk Cousins, QB made big waves of their own. 6th round pick Alfred Morris set The Redskins single season rushing record with 1,613 yards and 13 TD's while 4th round pick Kirk Cousins provided 1st round talent leading The Redskins to over-time and an improbable comeback victory against The Baltimore Ravens when an injured RGIII left the field. Kirk Cousins would go on to start the week after on the road in Cleveland throwing for 329 yards and 2 TD's to 1 INT leading The Redskins to a 38-21 win.

The Redskins went 5-1 in their division riding a seven game winning streak into the playoffs after falling 3-6 before the bye-week. They did this by relying on an incredibly efficient and explosive passing game coupled with the leagues best rushing attack exploiting the read-option pistol formation much to the dismay of opposing defenses.  

**Low Points** 

* Injuries: SS Brandon Meriweather sat out the first 3 weeks of the season recovering from a torn MCL only to re-injure himself in a pregame collision during warm-ups in week 4. Meriweather would return in week 10 against Philadelphia registering an INT and several hard hits, his presence in the backfield was a breath of fresh-air to a struggling secondary. He left the game early and missed the rest of the season with a ACL tear. In week 2 The Redskins suffered a pair of devastating losses with Pro-Bowl LB Bryan Orakpo tearing a pectoral muscle and DE Adam Carriker tearing a quad tendon in his right knee, both players would be lost for the season crippling The Redskins pass rush. WR Pierre Garçon took an RGIII pass 88 yards for a TD in week 1, he limped off the field and subsequently missed nearly half the season with a plantar plate tear in his right foot. Contemplating season ending surgery Garçon opted out and was able to return week 10 and play full-time. Finally, TE Fred Davis, the teams leading receiver suffered a torn Achilles tendon in week 7 missing the rest of the regular season. 

* Pass Defense: The Redskins secondary was a liability throughout the season consistently blowing coverage's and giving up huge plays over the top ensuring just about every opposing QB had a career day. Almost every bit of good The Redskins offense did was constantly undermined by a defense giving up an equal or greater play going the other way. To their credit the secondary did tighten up considerably over the second half of the season and a stout rush defense helped them get by. 

* Lack of composure: Week 2's match-up at the Rams' Edward Jones Dome could be summed up in one word: shitshow. The replacement refs really showcased how bad they were capable of letting things get in this game. Terrible blown calls mostly benefited the Redskins in the first half giving a 21-6 lead, but post-whistle hitting and shoving was becoming hard to watch by the fourth quarter. After LB Brian Orakpo and DE Adam Carriker, two of the best players on the Redskins defense, were injured in the second quarter, Sam Bradford had a great game, going 26/35 for 310 yd, 3 TD and 1 INT. Danny Amendola had a career game, catching 15 passes for 160 yd and 1 TD. With the Redskins down 28-31 and approaching FG range for a game-tying kick, CB Cortland Finnegan was able to draw a personal foul call on WR Josh Morgan, sending the Redskins back out of FG range.

* Week 7 Loss at the Giants: A DAGGER THROUGH MY HEART! RGIII made some incredible plays to keep the game alive, including an epic 4th down scramble, scurrying around DE JPP and completing the pass to TE Logan Paulsen. After a beautiful 30 yard TD pass to Santana Moss to take a 3 point lead with 1:11 remaining, Victor Cruz blew past FS Madieu Williams on the second play of the Giants' drive for a 77 yard TD. When the Redskins started rallying back, Santana Moss fumbled the game away to seal the 23-27 loss. Absolute heart-breaker. 

* Week 9 Home Loss to the Panthers: During an embarrassing ""homecoming"" game The Redskins played terribly. Cam Newton didn't. The Redskins lost 21-13 to fall to 3-6 overall marking a three game losing streak heading into the bye and Mike Shanahan commented that he's starting to evaluate the players for 2013, causing an absolute shitstorm and was easily the lowest low for the year.

* Wildcard Weekend: Oh boy. Oh boy oh boy oh boy. Coming off of a seven game winning streak The Redskins hosted The Seattle Seahawks in a game that will live on in infamy. The season ended in heartbreak as The Redskins fell 24-14 after scoring two consecutive TD's on their opening two drives on route to what looked like a blowout. To add injury to insult an already hobbled Robert Griffin III suffered both MCL and LCL tears as his knee buckled trying to recover a fumbled snap late in the game. The Redskins coaching staff was treated with an absolute onslaught of criticism for their handling of RGIII. Redskins management meanwhile drew an onslaught of criticism for the field quality at FedEx stadium which was clearly a contributing factor to injuries sustained by players on both teams.  

**High Points** 

* RGIII Debut: Redskins fans hoped for the best but were prepared for the worst opening the season on the road in the Super-dome with a rookie QB at the helm. Then, suddenly, pistol formation. RGIII completed his first seven throws, with his seventh pass taken 88 yards for a TD to Pierre Garcon. RGIII ended the game going 19/26 for 320 yards and 2 TD's in a 40-32 win. Redskins fans had not seen offensive scoring and fireworks like that in over a decade. The defense was sound, limiting Drew Brees to 24/52 passing and registering 3 takeaways. 

* Kai Forbath: The offseason had a fierce kicking battle between Graham Gano and Neil Rackers. Both were kicking very well, and deciding who was going to be the Week 1 starter was tough. Then Mike Shanahan threw everyone for a loop and signed on Billy Cundiff, the most hated Ravens kicker of all-time. Through three weeks he was an essentially perfect 5/6 (his only miss was a 62-yard attempt at the end of the Rams game), then went 1/4 against the Bucs, but made the 41-yard game winner. After missing another one against the Falcons, Kai Forbath was brought in for a tryout and beat out Cundiff. Forbath's first FG attempt was a booming 50-yard FG against the Vikings. He would go on to set the record for most consecutive made FG's to begin a career with 17. Eleven were from 40+, and against the Ravens he made FG's from 48, 49, and the game-winner from 34 yards in OT.

* Dallas Thanksgiving Game: The Redskins were 4-6 and the Cowboys were 5-5, so the winner was going to be in second place behind the Giants. The Redskins came out scorching hot, scoring four TD's in the second quarter to take a 28-3 lead at half. The Cowboys would make a couple big plays in garbage time to lose 38-31. RGIII finished 19/27 for 304 yd, 4 TD, and 1 INT. Alfred Morris finished with 113 yd on 24 carries.

* The ever-popular Battle of the Beltway: The Redskins were on a three-game win streak to sit at 6-6 with a renewed hope for the playoffs. The Ravens were 9-3 and looking to rebound after a close loss at home against the Steelers. The Redskins took an early 14-7 lead but Ravens came back and took an 8-point lead with 4:52 left in the 4th quarter. RGIII was injured by Haloti Ngata on a 2nd down scramble bringing in Captain Kirk Cousins for his NFL debut on a 3rd and 6. A PI call gave the Redskins a new set of downs and allowed RGIII to come back in. The Redskins drove down to the 16 yard line, but RGIII had to come out again after an intentional grounding call. In comes Kirk Cousins, who completed a 15 yard pass over the middle, then a 3rd down TD strike to Pierre Garcon. The Redskins ran a 5-wide QB draw to get the 2-point conversion and force OT. The Ravens received and went three-and-out, and newly minted rookie punt returner CB Richard Crawford took the punt return back 64 yds down to the Ravens' 24. A Kai Forbath kick gave the Redskins an unbelievable win.

* Dallas Week 17 Game: Perhaps the biggest Redskins game since Superbowl XXVI in 1991. The winner gets the NFC East crown and heads to the playoffs. The loser gets to begin their off-season. With RGIII's knee in a brace, Kyle Shanahan brought the ground attack. Alfred Morris was fed 33 times for 200 yd and 3 TD. Tony Romo had a rough, rough start, throwing two INT's in the first quarter. Still, a couple of great throws kept the Cowboys in the game until an INT to OLB Rob Jackson in the 4th quarter sealed the game. The Redskins won 28-18, completing their 7-game win streak, winning the NFC East title for the first time since 1999, and ending the greatest run to the playoffs in Redskins history.

**General**



* Coming off of an uninspired 10 game losing streak to close out the 2011 season, the Bucs decided to completely overhaul the entire coaching staff.  First year head coach Greg Schiano was brought in to replace the player friendly Raheem Morris.  Schiano wasted little time bringing in coordinators Mike Sullivan (OC) and Bill Sheridan (DC) to implement new offensive and defensive schemes.  Offensively, the Bucs would focus on the ground game while taking several shots down field.  Defensively, the Bucs have almost completely rid themselves of the Tampa-2 base in favor of playing man coverage and creating (or attempting to create) pressure with blitz packages.  Much of Schiano's focus was to bring a never-say-die toughness to the team which he exemplified on the controversial victory formation play week 2 against the Giants. 



* Tampa Bay's front offense made several significant changes to the roster in the off season.  Unlike any year in recent memory, the Buccaneers spent big money in free agency to land WR Vincent Jackson, G Carl Nicks and CB Eric Wright.  Then, GM Mark Dominik masterfully worked trades to draft starters S Mark Barron, RB Doug Martin and LB Lavonte David.  All three rookies were highly productive throughout the season, providing building blocks for a bright future.  Subtractions were deemed necessary as well.  Several players including Kellen Winslow Jr, Brian Price and Dezmon Briscoe were purged for not meeting Greg Schiano's standard of a Buccaneer man.  



* The Buccaneer’s season was a roller coaster of emotions for fans.  Tampa Bay got off to a sluggish start losing 3 of their first 4 games, including a 0-3 record to NFC East opponents.  Coming out of their week 5 bye, the Bucs caught fire, winning 5 out of 6 games, finding themselves at 6-4 and in good position for a playoff run.  During this span, the Buccaneers offense was absolutely clicking, averaging over 35 points per game.  After capping off their winning streak with an exciting overtime win against the Panthers, the Bucs went cold, losing 5 straight games including an embarrassing 41-0 trouncing by the New Orleans Saints.  Mercifully, the Bucs won their final game of the season against the Falcons, who had already clenched NFC’s #1 seed.  



* The Buccaneers have given the Tampa Bay area something new to cheer for: an offense.  The Bucs may not have been the best in the league, finishing 9th in total yards and 13th in points scored, but this was their most prolific offense ever in their 37 year history.  The team set a franchise record with 5,820 yards of total offense, 389 total points scored and 44 TDs.  Josh Freeman set the individual team record for most TD passes thrown in single season (27) and became the first Buccaneer to throw for over 4,000 yards.  Doug Martin chipped in by setting the franchise rookie rushing record of 1,454 yards.  Despite all of this, the offense struggled in some games and QB Josh Freeman drew a lot of criticism for his inconsistent play.  



* Overall, the defense was terrible, placing 23rd in the league in scoring defense by giving up an average of 24.6 points per games.  Defensive breakdowns were commonplace and opponents were allowed to mount comebacks with relative ease.  With that said, however bad the Bucs were on defense in some areas, they were stellar in other areas, making them somewhat of an anomaly.  They finished dead last in pass defense, getting torched for an average of 297.4 ypg.  On the other hand, the Bucs had the leagues’ best run defense, allowing a mere 82.5 ypg setting the franchise record.  Part of their inability to stop the pass was a lack of QB pressure.  Tied for 29th place with Kansas City, the Bucs only sacked opposing QBs 27 times.  Interestingly, the Bucs dominated the league in tackles for a loss despite the low sack number.  The defensive as a whole was clearly the weakest link, but the stout run defense and breakout individual performers give cause for hopeful future.



**Highs**



* Ronde Barber celebrated his 200th consecutive start (all with Tampa Bay) in the season opener against Carolina.  The veteran defensive back notched an interception, a sack, and a key stop near the goal line to help the Bucs open the season with a 16-10 victory.



* Week 1 against Carolina was also the debut of the Bucs stout run defense.  In the game, Cam Newton and company only managed to post a measly 10 rushing yards.  At the conclusion of the season, the Bucs finished #1 in run defense by allowing a mere 82.5 ypg, the 11th best mark in the history of the league. 



* Coming off their week 5 bye, the Buccaneers got hot, winning 5 out of 6 games.  Much of the Bucs’ success during this span was due in large part to the play of QB Josh Freeman.  During their streak, Freeman put up gaudy stats, throwing for 1715 yards (285.8 ypg), 16 TDs and only 3 INTs (2 thrown in one game against Carolina).  Freeman became the first Buccaneer to throw 3 TDs in 3 consecutive games.  



* WR Vincent Jackson proved to be worthy of the generous contract he landed in the off season.  Jackson’s best game came in a loss against the New Orleans Saints in week 7.  VJax hauled in 7 catches for 216 yards and a TD, averaging almost 31 yards per reception.  Throughout the season, Jackson ended with 72 receptions for 1,384 yards and 8 TDs.  His 19.2 yards per catch average was tops in the league.  He also [made this catch](http://thebiglead.fantasysportsven.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/vjax-td2-11-18-12.gif) to the dismay of Panthers fans in week 11.



* Tampa receivers tied the league record with zero turnovers on the season.



* Tampa Bay’s only prime time game, week 8 @ Minnesota, was the coming out party for rookie Doug Martin.  The Boise State product rushed for 135 yards, recorded 3 catches for 79 yards and notched 2 total TDs.  Most of his receiving yards came [on this play](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1628781/martinscreen.gif) where Martin showed his speed and versatility.  



* Doug Martin followed up his breakout performance against the Vikings with one of the [best rushing performances](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1686921/hamsterHOF.gif) of all time against the Oakland Raiders in week 9.  On just 25 carries, Martin rushed for 251 yards (an average of 10 yards per carry) and 4 TDs.  His 251 yards in a single game were good enough to place 9th all-time and broke James Wilder’s franchise record of 219 set in 1983.  Martin would have placed even higher until he rushed for negative yardage on 3 consecutive carries in an effort to run out the clock.  With touchdown runs of 1, 45, 67 and 70 yards, he became the first back since at least 1940 to score on three TD runs of at least 45 yards in a single game.  He also joins Denver’s Mike Anderson as the only running backs to amass at least 250 yards and find the end zone 4 times in one game.  Being from Oakland, the 31st overall draft pick did all of this in front of more than 60 friends and family members. 



* Doug Martin's 2012 stat line is impressive: 319 carries for 1,454 yards (4.6 average), 49 receptions 472 yards (9.6 average), and 12 total TDs.  Martin's 1,454 rushing yards gives him the franchise rookie rushing record and places him second behind James Wilder's (1544 yards) franchise record.  Equally impressive, out of his 368 total touches, Martin only fumbled once on a play that could have easily been called a TD.



* Rookie Lavonte David's 139 total tackles rank second among rookies and 9th overall.  Out of his 139 tackles, 112 were solo tackles ranking first among rookies and third overall.  David absolutely flies around the field, reminiscent of the great Derrick Brooks. 



* Tampa Bay finished the season with 95 tackles for a loss, doubling the league average and 18 TFLs ahead of second place (DET) and 30 ahead of third (PHI).  Rookie Lavonte David was responsible for 20 TLFs, placing him third in the league and first among rookies.  His 20 tackles for a loss are the second most for a rookie since the league started recording the stat in 2000.



**Lows**



* Despite being one of the few teams to take advantage of the league’s new 85% rule, 6 of the Buccaneer’s 8 home games were blacked out.  The team once boasted a season-ticket waiting list of more than 100,000 fans, but has really struggled to fill the stadium since the glory days.



* Week 2 at the NY Giants began with much promise, but the defense broke allowing the G-Men to come back and win 41-34.  The pass defense was non-existent for the Bucs, as they allowed Eli Manning to throw for over 500 yards.



* The Bucs followed up their defensive meltdown to the Giants with an inept offense against the Cowboys in week 3.  Josh Freeman completed 10 of 28 attempts (35.7%) for 110 yards, threw an interception and fumbled twice.



* Tampa Bay was still in the thick of playoff talks when week 14 rolled around.  They were playing the dysfunctional Eagles who were riding an 8 game losing streak.  Though looking like the better team, Tampa’s deficient secondary allowed the Eagles to drive down the field, earning the victory with a TD pass from Nick Foles on the final play of the game.  Foles threw for a career best 381 yards.  All playoff hopes were abandoned.



* The Bucs would love to forget their week 15 game at the division rival New Orleans Saints.  The Saints absolutely trounced the Bucs 41-0.  This was the Saints first shutout victory since 1995.  What’s worse?  The Saints pitched their shutout despite their historically bad defense.  The opposing QBs had polar opposite days: Josh Freeman threw 0 TDs and 4 INTs while Drew Brees threw 4 TDs and 0 INTs.  This was painful to watch.



* Corners Aqib Talib and Eric Wright each earned a 4 game suspension for Adderall use.  With one game left on his suspension, the troubled Talib was traded to New England for a 4th round draft pick.  Eric Wright would not see the field again, likely to be cut in the offseason.  The suspensions transformed a bad secondary into the league’s worst.  



* Throughout the season, the Bucs were hit hard with injuries and suspensions.  They lost former first round draft picks, pro bowlers and talented role players as the season progressed.  Every team has to deal with injuries, but the Bucs proved to lack any semblance of depth.  



* 7 out of Tampa’s 9 losses were within one score.  Some may consider this to be a high point of the season since they hung with most opponents and show promise for the future, but the Bucs inability to find a way to win was clearly a weakness and cost them a potential playoff berth.  



**Free Agency / Draft Concerns**



Adding depth at every position is essential.  Needs for the starting roster include CB, FS, TE.  Wants include OLB, DL, WR3.



* Vincent Jackson and Carl Nicks both restructured their contracts, allowing the Bucs $30.1 million of available cap space, 5th most out of all 32 teams. 



* GM Mark Dominik deftly added a clause to Eric Wright’s contract eliminating any liability should the CB get suspended.  Wright missed 4 games with an Adderall suspension, thus, the Bucs can cut him without paying out any guaranteed money or receiving a salary cap penalty.  Therefore, I fully expect the Bucs to cut Wright and focus on landing a quality starter or two in free agency.  Possible fits include Sam Shields, Brent Grimes and Chris Houston.  



* Ronde Barber may have another season in him.  The Bucs already expressed an interest in re-signing him, but Ronde has yet to make his decision.  If Ronde decides to hang it up, the Bucs will need to find a replacement.  Ahmad Black showed some promise in limited work last year, but the need will likely be filled in free agency or the draft.  Possible FAs include Jairus Byrd (I did say *possible*) and Kenny Phillips.



* Dallas Clark played well given his age and injury history, but Luke Stocker was somewhat of a disappointment.  I’m not sure either player will return to the team.  The name rumor mills keep producing is Martellus Bennett, but Dustin Keller is another possibility.



* The Bucs will also look to replace Sam Backer Quincy Black, bolster the O-Line with a RT (or LT and move Donald Penn to the right), and get a slot receiver to complement Vincent Jackson and Mike Williams.  



*The Draft*



Last year, GM Mark Dominik moved up and down the draft to find three studs in the first two rounds.  Given the Bucs biggest need is at CB, I fully expect the Bucs to once again find trading partners.  The only prospect worthy of the #13 overall pick is Dee Milliner out of Alabama, but he’ll likely be off the board.  If the Bucs don’t move up to get him, they’ll have a number of options without much separation in talent.  In this scenario, Tampa will likely trade down to select Xavier Rhodes, Jonathon Banks, Desmond Trufant or Jordan Poyer. If the Bucs do stay at pick 13, they may elect to draft a TE like Zach Ertz or Tyler Eifert.  Then again, the massive Jonathan Jenkins out of Georgia is an interesting prospect to pair with Gerald McCoy on the interior of the D-Line.  Since the Bucs look to be players in free agency, all this can change dramatically. "	t5_2qmg3	True
