Hi everyone, my name's Jen, and I'll be handling the AMA if/when it does happen.  Let me know a day that works for you for this - I'm around Monday through Friday, and I'll be at my computer 8 am to 5 pm.  

Since I spend most of my day working on a computer, and this is technically considered ""work"", there is also no reason on the day you guys want, I just come back and answer your questions for my whole work day.   

So, you guys wanna do a reptile care kind of AMA?  When do you wanna do this?

**Holy crap guys that's a lot of enthusiasm!  Okay, so Tuesday, August 6th it is, from 8 ish am til 5 pm, PST.  See you guys then!

So many times I see people bashing each other mercilessly of care that others give their reptiles. For example, someone on here posted a picture of her two male leos and people went nuts. Never-mind, that they had been together since birth, or never fight; since the internet says not to house to males together then they are automatically doing something wrong. From what I see, people read care sheets, then take them as the bible and bash others who deviate from these. They are not speaking from personal experience most of the time. Can we just stop fighting each-other and fight the real enemy like those who want to ban reptiles as pets etc? Sure, if someone is doing something OBVIOUSLY wrong (which I rarely see) then there isn't a problem. But most of the time it is minor things. Some people need to be taken down a notch. Stop relishing the opportunity in which you can tell someone something they are doing is wrong.

**tl;dr, stop the senseless bitching.**

1343670255.0	xeg51	One of the most common questions/issues on this reddit - proper substrate	BigDrunkPartyAnimal	48	10	15	"I have literally addressed the same issue about 5 times today. Either someone posts a picture of their animal on improper bedding (which either leads to education, or a pissing contest), or somebody posts a question about proper substrates. Here's a list to help you out. I'm not infallible, so I'll update this with anything that needs revision.

First and foremost, there's an excellent chance that the person at the pet store doesn't know what he/she is talking about. Same thing goes for the guy down the street that used to own an iguana 20 years ago. Improper substrates can lead to impaction, poor shedding, eye infections, and respiratory infections. All of these things can means expensive vet bills, and death.

**Bearded Dragons, Leopard Geckos, and other arid lizards**: slate tile (my personal favorite), reptile carpet, paper towels, or non-adhesive shelf liner. I've seen/read some people recommending alfalfa pellets (especially for beardies), but in my opinion these smell like shit and can harbor mold/bacteria. Uromastyx are also successfully housed on white millet/birdseed, but I think this option should be unique to the species.

**Blue Tongue Skinks, terrestrial snakes, and most of burrowing reptiles that don't require tropical humidty**: aspen shavings, cypress/orchid mulch, chemical-free soil (usually reserved for larger lizards like monitors and tegus)

**Most frogs, planted terrariums, and tropical species**: chemical-free soil, coconut coir (aka bed-a-beast)

**Most arboreal snakes, geckos, lizards, etc.**: paper towel, slate tile, reptile carpet, non-adhesive shelf liner, chemical-free soil, or coconut coir. The latter two, IMO, should be reserved only for enclosures with live plants or who's inhabitants require tropical humidity

You'll notice that I don't have sand, calci-sand, or ground walnut shells *anywhere* on my lists. That's because they're absolute shit.

That's off the top of my head - be sure to let me know if I've made any mistakes or should add anything."	t5_2qy22	True

I don't even comment or click text posts anymore because most users attack other peoples care techniques. I'm tired of hearing about everyone thinking they're 100% right all the time and only they care for their pets right and everyone else is an uneducated animal abuser, it's not okay, or polite, and frankly, it makes you look like a snob. Please stop this! opinions are like naughty bits, they're fine, just don't shove them at others in public. If someone is honestly wrong and being harmful, be polite!

No he goes on the attack, he bites a dog taking a tuft of hair and begins running after them.My dad said he was chasing around the dogs with the tuft of dog hair in his mouth. I suspect he was using it to track down the animals. Also my mom tried to calm him down and he took a bite of her finger.

1375118060.0	1jacrg	How does the DEA see us reptile owners?	deedeeiam	33	6	20	"Random title, I know, but I rarely submit topics.

A while back, this fellow down the road had his house raided by a joint law enforcement task force. They weren't exactly stealthy about the sweeps they were doing.  The DEA had a helicopter they were using with heat detecting (IR) technology on board, so there was a bunch of controversy over that. 

As I was watching from the front porch, I noticed that these two men kept looking down at their binder and tablets and then pointing over toward my house. I finally asked if there was something I could help them with. They said no, and scampered off.  Two weeks later I'm out on a date with a state trooper who was at that raid, and I find out what was so interesting about my house. Turns out, the heat signature on my basement was stronger than the marijuana grow house. The only thing in my basement? My herp collection!  Most of the collection needs 80 degrees F or higher for their ambient heat, and the spot lights are much higher.

So, now, in the back of my mind, I'm always wondering if those two little geeks thought I was growing me some weed in my house. This amuses me a great deal.

What other random thoughts do you ponder when it comes to your herps and other people's impressions? Something you *know* someone is probably thinking about you and your collection? Or something you've been told about your collection that you find hilarious?
