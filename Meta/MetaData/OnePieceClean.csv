不覚です!
少々我慢しすぎて事態を悪化させてしまいました。
続きを楽しみにしてくれている読者の皆様と、
暴れるのを楽しみにしている麦わらの一味の皆様に、
多大な迷惑をおかけしております。
ただ今痛ェ治療を続けております。
次回せっかく新展開なのに、早く読んで欲しい気持ちで
いっぱいです。少年達の２週間がどれ程長いか承知してます。
ちょっと待っててください。

TRANSLATION:
&gt;This is a real blunder!
I tried enduring a bit too much, but that just made the problem worse.
To you, the readers who are looking forward to the rest of the story,
and to the Strawhat crew, who are looking forward to more rampaging and going wild,
I’ve really done you wrong.
At the moment, I’m undergoing some painful treatment.
With long-awaited developments coming up in the story next time, I can’t wait to have everyone read it.
I full-well acknowledge just how long two weeks can seem to young boys.
Just hang in there for a bit.

1363578347.0	1ai6xf	On fights in One Piece	Portal2Reference	281	40	43	"There's something strange about the fights in One Piece. Despite a plethora of creative techniques and abilities, and a large focus on fights, the fights themselves really aren't that interesting. Now, before you take out your pitchforks, give me a second, I'm not saying that we need less fights, or that One Piece is somehow worse during the fights. No, I'm just saying that when it comes to actual combat, not much happens.

Think about it. Other manga use a variety of techniques to make fights more interesting. Some will build tension by having characters save their most powerful attacks until the last minute, fighting with ""weighted clothing"" or ""not my final form"". In One Piece, people have no qualms about fighting at full strength, except not using techniques that have large drawbacks (pre timeskip gear 3rd).

Other times, the manga will show both fighters thoughts as they fight, describing what they're doing, what they're planning. Sometimes a 3rd party will narrate what people are doing. Sometimes both fighters will stop talking all together and just fight each other, like you would in a real fight. But in One Piece, when people are fighting each other, their dialogue is almost always focused on character, or the plot (or describing how a technique works, such as Shigan or Gear Second).

So what are fights in One Piece really about then? Well, that brings me to the point of this thread. **Fights in One Piece are not about physical strength, strategy, or magic abilities. Fights in One Piece are about *will* .**

If you think about it that way, a lot of things that happen in One Piece start to really make sense. In the CP9 Saga, how were the Straw Hats able to go from being absolutely destroyed by CP9 to overpowering them in only a day? If you remember, the reason Nami gives is because  they knew the truth about Robin. Now, normally, this doesn't really make sense, because how could the Straw Hats become *that much* more powerful than CP9 literally overnight just because they they knew Robin wanted to be saved? It's because the strongest will in One Piece is the will to protect your Nakama.

This is why Usopp was able to put up a fight with Luffy on Water 7. Of course, there are other practical reasons, such as Usopp setting up before the fight and knowing all about Luffy, but in reality there's no way Usopp should have been able to put a dent into Luffy. However, the real reason he was able to damage someone who would normally completely overpower him was because of the will he got from wanting to save Merry.

Recently, this will has actually been given a physical form in the show as Haki. Haki, especially Conqueror's Haki, is literally the physical manifestation of will. As we see during Punk Hazard [Punk Hazard Spoiler](#s ""Law is able to cut through Vergo's Armament Haki, even though previously this same Haki was powerful enough to stop him. This is because Law's Haki, aka his will, has been strengthened since he stopped following Doflamingo, and decided to take on a Yonko."")

This also explains why people freaked shit when they saw Luffy could use Conqueror's Haki at Marineford. They dropped everything in the middle of a war to take him down, because they realized the threat that Luffy's will posed if it was allowed to grow. Will doesn't just win you fights in One Piece, it's also what allows you to change the world. It wouldn't surprise me at all of Dragon also has Conqueror's Haki.

Now think about the villains in One Piece. At the beginning of the series, most of the villains lacked Will. Kuro was tired of being a pirate, Krieg was driven out of the Grand Line, Arlong was strong because of his hatred towards humans, but grew complacent in the luxuries of Arlong Park, Crocodile and Moriah both became Shichibukai after giving up on life as pirates. Then look at the stronger pirates, the ones residing in Paradise. 

Whitebeard, who possed the Conqueror's Haki wanted to have and protect a family. Doflamingo [Manga Spoilers](#s ""is apparently charismatic enough to inspire total loyalty from his subordinates"" ). One of the reasons Teach is so scary is because his Will is probably the only one on par with Luffy [A MAN'S DREAM WILL NEVER DIE!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXUFfoI9Rhc).

Similarly, the villains with the weakest will, the Helmeppos, Spandams and Celestial Dragons are also the physically weakest people in One Piece. There's a reason that CP9, Spandam's subordinates, were so much stronger than him, while Crocodile was the most powerful member of his organization.

Finally, this fits in with Oda's explanation about why he doesn't let villains in One Piece die. According to Oda, he doesn't kill off villains because there's no point, Luffy has already defeated their will. They're forced to find a new will after losing to Luffy. That's why Crocodile rekindled his piracy after getting free from Impel Down.

There's a lot more I could talk about this, but this post is already way too long, and I'm afraid not many people are going to want to read it. If you reread the manga, it's interesting how many things are relevant to this. It's one of the core aspects of One Piece that I think people only pick up subconsciously, and I wanted to expand on it concretely.

tl;dr Fights in One Piece aren't about combat. They're about a clash of wills. The stronger will (usually) wins."	t5_2rfz5	True

but I have more results than that! so let's analyze the results like crazy!

If you didn't see the survey it had 5 parts. **Part 1** : List your 5 favorite characters, then list your 5 favorite non-Strawhat characters. **Part 2** : Rank the Strawhats in order of most to least favorite. **Part 3** : Rank each arc on a scale of Hated it to Super!!! **Part 4** : List your 3 favorite Devil Fruits and the devil fruit you would choose if you could have a devil fruit. **Part 5** list any other animes/mangas you watch and other general hobbies.

***

**General Survey info**

- 400 people took the survey (that's 3% of this sub, which is better than any national survey does)

- The most varied character name entered was Mr. 2/Bon Kurei/Bon Clay/Bentham. 

- The average fan has read the manga 1.73 times. Between all the survey takers, the manga has been read 515 times over. If you assume that represents the 12,000 people subscribed to this sub (it doesn't but bear with me), this sub has read the manga 20,760 times.

- The average fan has watched the anime 1.66 times. Between all the survey takers, the anime has been watched 496 times over, and a total of 19920 times from all the shitty cooks on this sub. This means the survey takers have spent 6328960 minutes watching the anime (assuming 22 minutes per episode). That's 105,000 hours, or 4395 days, or 12 years of watching the anime from the survey takers. For the entire sub, it's 254,179,200 minutes or 4,236,320 hours or 176,513 days or 483 years - but once again that's assuming a bit. I willing to bet this is nothing compared to how much the country of Japan has watched it.

**Part 1 results**

Part 1 was about everyone's top 5 favorite characters. This part was broken down into two questions. One which All the characters were an option, and another which only non-strawhats were an option. The second question was asked because as predicted the Straw hats dominated as people's favorite characters, so the non-strawhat question allowed for some other characters to make it onto the survey.

So some terms :

Count : The number of times a character was put in the top 5.

Score : A number for a character based on how many times their name was put and what position it was put in. Put as a #1 favorite gives the character 5 pts, #2 = 4pts, #3 =3pts #4 = 2pts #5=1pt.  So if Luffy was put as a #1 by one person, #1 as a second person, and #2 by a third person, his score would be 5+5+4 = 14.

Onto charts :

[Here are all characters in a bar chart by score](http://i.imm.io/XwKF.png)

as you can see, Luffy and Zoro obviously dominate, [Spoiler](#s "" I was personally surprised Law beat out Sanji"")

[Here is the same data, but more entertaining to read. The larger the word the higher the score](http://i.imgur.com/bunXRcX.png)

[This is a bar chart by count, broken down into the #1,#2,#3,#4,and#5 votes each character got](http://i.imgur.com/OZenJh0h.png)

What you can see from this is about 300 people put Luffy in their top 5, or 75% of people think of Luffy as a top 5 character.

[Here is a word plot of the counts](http://i.imgur.com/gihBI5J.png)

***Non-Strawhats***

This is pretty much the same type of question as the last one, but people left out the Strawhats

**Part 2**

This question was pretty straight forward, rank the Strawhats 1-9. 

[Here's the popularity of the Strawhats based on score](http://i.imgur.com/WCgacGO.png)

[Here is a word plot of that data](http://i.imgur.com/lACUT9h.png)

[Nami](http://i.imgur.com/C38kP1j.png)

[Here is the raw data](http://i.imgur.com/Xzghak4.png)

What I thought was interesting, was people ranked the strawhats differently on how the question was asked. [This chart shows the difference in order of the strawhats between the results from part 1 and part 2 of this survey.](http://i.imgur.com/Pc5lkKF.png) ""All Char"" = part 1, which is people putting strawhats when thinking of their top 5. ""SH only"" is part two which is directly ranking the strawhats. I find it interesting the monster trio are rank 1-3 in both question, and Nami is at the bottom, but the other Straw hats mix around.

***

**Part 4**

(I know I haven't done part 3 yet, It's after this one). 

Part 4 has people rank their 3 favorite devil fruits, and name one they would have if they could have a devil fruit.

[Here is the raw data](http://i.imgur.com/PegBeKy.png)

AND [What Devil fruits everyone wants to have](http://i.imgur.com/m0K6L2b.png)

***Part 3*** or why anime watchers should be incredibly excited for Punk hazard

Part 3 had everyone rank the arcs between Dislike (-2),boring (-1),OK (0) ,like (1) ,love (2), Oda-level (3) and Super!!!(4). A score for each arc is taken by averaging the rankings each fan gave the arc.

[Here are the ratings for each arc](http://i.imgur.com/aj9b1VXh.png)

If you notice Punk Hazard was rated 3rd best, behind Enies Lobby and Marineford.

[Here are those same ratings, but also showing number of each opinion on the arcs](http://i.imgur.com/V7hbV1rh.png)

[Here are the rankings, but taking into account the length of each arc](http://i.imgur.com/SBe8ySvh.png)

OK ready to take this to the next level?

[This chart takes the scores given to each characters from part 1, and adds them depending on what arc they show up in.](http://i.imgur.com/zznea4Gh.png). The blue line is the number of top 5 characters in each arc, the red lines are the scores. For example the Amazon Lily arc has 3 characters (Luffy + Hancock + Margerette) which is the value of the blue line, and adds up those character's scores from part 1 (1123 + 29 +6). You'll notice a dip in the Amazon Lily, Impel Down and Marineford arcs because only one Straw hat took part in that arc.

[This chart is the same as the last one BUT with only non-Strawhat characters](http://i.imgur.com/NRZkHSYh.png). 

[This chart is like the other two, but with Devil fruits instead of characters](http://i.imgur.com/WDD7PZSh.png) Note : I only counted the Devil fruit as part of the arc if the Devil fruit is used for the plot so [Marineford spoiler](#s "" even tho Law shows up at the end to save Luffy, his Ope ope no Mi didn't contribute to the plot so the Ope ope no mi is not counted for the Marineford arc"").

[This chart has all those previous charts in one](http://i.imgur.com/kZmjtDnh.png) All scores are normalized (meaning they're divided by the top score to be on a 0-1 scale). What I like about this chart is it shows stuff like how Arlong Park is rated highly as an arc despite having a low amount of favorite characters and devil fruits.

[This chart has all those value combined as one score](http://i.imgur.com/P4aKqNqh.png). Meaning the rating of the arc, devil fruits in the arc, and characters in the arc are added together for one score. 

***

**Part 5**

OK, almost done. Part 5 just asked people to list other things they like.

[Here are the other anime and manga One Piece fans like](http://i.imgur.com/NFEVxXA.png)

[Here are other hobbies OP fans like](http://i.imgur.com/O6I2poX.png)   and [this is the raw data to that](http://i.imgur.com/XTmbzrT.png). Reasonably close responses were close together. For example 'friends' 'hanging out' 'socializing' 'having fun with friends' ect. were all summed together as 'Nakama'. I was also unsure if when people put gaming, if they meant video games, or gaming as video games plus board games plus other kinds of games.

Well fret no longer my friends, for I am here to help you find that answer.

**Estimations**  
Let's kick things off with basic estimations. [This shot](http://i.imgur.com/sORQYkX.png) in the manga is where we first see the volume of air Kuma is compressing. Keep in mind this is likely already compressed a bit. We know Kuma is 689 cm or 6.89 meters tall. By a rough estimate, I would say the original chunk of air is about 7 Kuma's wide (give or take half a Kuma). This translates to a diameter of 48.23 meters; let's say an even 50 to account for any compression that already happened. Assuming the chunk of air is perfectly spherical, this gives us an initial volume of 65,450 m^3. Right before Kuma throws the air, it looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/uMLDAdv.png). This looks to be about the height of his hat, which I'd say is about 1/14 the size of his body. This gives his hat (and the compressed air) a diameter of .5 meters. Again assuming the compressed air is spherical, it has a volume of .07 m^3. The only other piece of information we need is the initial pressure of the gas. This will just be standard atmospheric pressure, 101.325 kPa. This is commonly referred to as ""one atmosphere"" of pressure.

**Calculations**  
Now we need an equation to put this all together. I'm going to make another assumption here as say that the compression was done isothermally (temperature stays the same throughout the compression) and without any loss of gas. Under these circumstances, Pressure and volume become inversely proportional by the relationship P1 * V1 = P2 * V2. the 1s designate initial pressure and volume while the 2s designate final pressure and volume. This is called Boyle's law. What we're looking for here is the pressure of the compressed gas so all I need to do is rearrange the equation for P2 =&gt; P2 = (P1 * V1) / V2 Plugging in our numbers: P2 = (101.325 kPa * 65450 m^3 ) / .07 m^3 = 94,738,875 kPa. This is 935,000 times our initial pressure; that's almost 1,000,000 or 10^6 times atmospheric pressure. Yikes. 

To give you a sense for this number, bike tires compress air to about 2 atmospheres, the surface of venus is subject to about 90 atm, scuba tanks about 200 atm and the bottom of the Mariana Trench sits at about 1500 atm. So Kuma compresses air to about 650 times the pressure of the deepest part of Earth's oceans. Yikes indeed.

Okay, so Kuma's got a dense chunk of air sitting around. What does that mean? I don't know nearly enough about fluid dynamics and explosives to talk about what would happen when a paw shaped ball of gas rapidly expands. Instead, I'll calculate the potential energy stored in the ball at relate it to something else. 

Pressure in a fluid largely functions as energy per unit volume. This means Pressure = Energy / Volume, or Energy = Pressure * Volume. With our numbers, this translates to Energy = 6,631,721,250 or 6.63x10^9 Joules. Again, for reference: 1 ton of TNT releases 4.184x10^9 joules of energy when it explodes, making Kuma's Ursus Shock equal to a little under 2 tons of TNT.  For a visual reference, 2 tons of TNT would be about a 10th the size of [this explosion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-k_fUy1umY). 

One other thing to consider: from what I understand, the ferocity of an explosion is largely dependent on the rate of expansion of the material. The pressure this gas is subject to is so ridiculously huge, the expansion rate would likely be high enough to be much more violent than the equivalent energy of TNT.

**Conclusions**  
So the Ursus Shock has the equivalent energy to about 2 tons of TNT. However, the immensely compressed air would likely expand at such a ridiculous rate, that the explosion could well be more violent than its TNT equivalent.

Thanks for reading. If you have any questions related to this topic, feel free to reply to this thread and I'll do my best to answer them. Also, feel free to let me know if you have suggestions/requests for future OP physics posts.

That said, I wanted to address something that isn't really too much of a problem, but could be in the future as we continue to grow.

Please don't downvote simply because someone has a different opinion than you.

We strive to make this place (with lots of help from everybody here) a friendly place for all One Piece fans.

If someone has an opinion about something, don't downvote it because you disagree with it. That type of thing happens all over reddit and frankly we're better than that!

Upvotes are easy to give, do that instead, especially if the comment adds to the discussion. If we downvote every opinion that differs from ours, we're no better than anywhere else. Let's keep the level of awesomeness high, shall we?

Bottom Line: Let's stay Suuuuuperrrr! 

(Any questions, comments, concerns, please air them out here.)

Take care!

**Disclaimer:** *This will probably look familiar to any subscribers to /r/NFL since they just had a post saying the same thing. They have a great mod team and community over there and manage to keep a very large and passionate group from devolving into chaos. Those of you who know me also know I'm a big football fan (Go Bengals!) and frequent commenter in that sub as well. I'd personally love to see /r/OnePiece be considered the /r/NFL of anime and manga subreddits. That's why their post inspired me to create this one.*

El Datto here welcoming you to the new r/onepiece on behalf of all the mods!

We're really excited about the new design and hope you enjoy it to. We've tried to make it both aesthetically pleasing whilst adding in some nifty features to enhance your r/onepiece browsing.

Some of the new features include:

* Latest chapter and episode discussion navigation just below the header, so you can jump to see what everyone is saying about the latest one piece content straight away.

* Duel spoilers for Manga and Anime, so you can be specific about who should be viewing your content. 

* Rotating strawhat snoos in the header.

* r/OnePiece [twitter account](https://twitter.com/onepiecereddit) so you can catch up with the latest posts from us on the go. 

* Sexy Thousand Sunny footer image for your pleasure!

There's obviously going to be bugs, glitches and teething problems as we launch this new design, so please be patient with us. I've set up a [discussion thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/pmodp/new_css_design_thread_bugs_glitches/) to discuss the new design in much more detail and as place for people to leave comments, suggestions, bugs, glitches, etc.

And with that, we leave you to enjoy your new subreddit.

Yosh!

First of all, they implemented the characters frontpage art, as well as adding those cute little flairs for us. The spoiler tag was a huge hit, which greatly improved the way we give away information without having to worry about 'accidentally' giving it away to unwanted eyes. And finally, the additions of many links on the sidebar, eg episode-chapter conversion, links to other sub-subreddits and websites just makes it very resourceful.

Being a small community, we drive the subreddit ourselves, but we cant achieve much without the help of the mods too, so i'd like to personally thank them for what they've. If I missed out anything, please add to it and give them more thanks."	t5_2rfz5	True

1373987273.0	1if0me	[Theory] Fireleg Sanji	newvox	210	48	196	"I know there's already been a large amount of discussion regarding possible recipients of the Mera Mera no Mi, but I wanted to make a case for why Sanji is, in my opinion, the best (and therefore most likely) candidate to receive the fruit.

**Given his current power level and his role within the Strawhats, Sanji is the crew member most in need of a power up.**

Of the monster trio, Sanji has the distinct disadvantage of fighting with his body, without the aid of devil fruit powers or weapons. Despite having Haki, Sanji is still highly susceptible to incapacitating bodily injuries, such as when he [broke his leg while fighting Vergo](http://www.mangapanda.com/one-piece/681/17) in the Punk Hazard arc. This injury severely impacted his ability to continue fighting. In general, Sanji's need to both attack and defend with his legs is a serious flaw in his fighting style, especially when compared to Luffy's rubber-like enhanced durability and Zoro's capability to block attacks with his swords, rather than with his body.

The logia powers of the Mera Mera no Mi would allow Sanji to circumvent disadvantages linked to the limited durability of his body. So far, characters with logia powers have been shown to have considerable durability, past even that of Busoshoku Haki, being able to avoid damage from attacks by phasing into their logia elements and recover by reforming. Given the high-impact nature of Sanji's fighting style and the increasing power levels and durability of antagonists in the New World, Sanji will need to improve his endurance and defensive capabilities if he wants to keep pace with Luffy and Zoro. Though Haki helps with this problem, it hasn't been enough to allow for weaponless fighting of strong New World antagonists. 

**The powers of the Mera Mera no Mi compliment Sanji's fighting style in a way that is completely different from Ace's use of the fruit.**

Many of Sanji's attacks already have the [motif of fire](http://www.mangapanda.com/one-piece/658/9), with Diable Jambe and Hell Memories being the most notable examples. I see this as evidence that Sanji would have no trouble integrating fire-based attacks into his fighting style. However, more tellingly, incorporating the powers of the Mera Mera no Mi into such physical kicking attacks would be an application of the fruit that's completely different from Ace's projectile-based use of the fruit. 

There are countless reasons why Oda wouldn't want the next bearer of the Mera Mera no Mi to closely mimic Ace's fighting style--it too readily invites comparisons between the two characters, cheapens the uniqueness and strength of Ace's fighting style, and is less interesting for the reader. Giving the fruit to Sanji will allow its fire-based powers to be utilized in a completely different fashion than we've seen before. Though it's possible that a new or different character could also achieve this end, I find it much less plausible that a character without a set physical fighting style would use the Mera Mera no Mi differently than Ace--the fireball-shooting style just seems to be the most intuitive application of fire logia powers. Sanji is certainly one of the few characters who could and would use the Mera Mera no Mi to improve his own unique fighting style, rather than to borrow from Ace's.

**The Mera Mera no Mi also augments Sanji's role as the crew's cook.**

It's easy to forget Sanji's role as the Strawhat cook, as it's mentioned only once in a while, but it's a crucial part of Sanji's character that we can't forget. The fire-based powers of the Mera Mera no Mi fit in perfectly with the act of cooking, which is largely impossible to do without fire. Thus, giving Sanji control of fire will not only improve his combative abilities, but it will also improve his abilities as a cook, as he would be able to control the size, shape, and intensity of the fire that he uses to cook. And it'd be really cool--just imagine Sanji holding a pan in the fiery palm of his hand. He literally wouldn't need a stove to cook anymore.

**Thematically, the element of fire symbolizes and epitomizes many aspects of Sanji's personality and character.**

Finally, in a literary sense, Sanji's fire-based powers symbolize his fiery and passionate personality. Oda oftentimes draws Sanji [catching fire or burning up](http://www.mangapanda.com/one-piece/653/4) in passion or anger--I understand that is a common trope in manga, but Sanji is one of the only characters that Oda regularly uses for this particular gag. Sanji's fiery passion for women also fits in well with the Mera Mera, and he's often used fire-based figurative language to describe his feelings for women.

Sanji also smokes, which is another fire-based habit. Just imagine Sanji lighting a cigarette with his fingertip. BAMF.

**Along with the existence of other strong swimmers of the crew, Jinbe's stated intent to join the Strawhats will further alleviate Sanji's responsibility to be the swimmer of the crew.**

Given the large number of fruit users in the Strawhat crew, it's important that they have at least a couple of strong swimmers to rescue the fruit users in times of need. As Sanji is one of the strongest swimmers in the crew, his inability to swim due to the Mera Mera no Mi would definitely be a loss for the crew. However, given that Zoro, Franky, Usopp, and Nami are all very unlikely to gain fruit powers, the benefit of gaining a powerful logia fruit user would certainly outweigh the cost of losing one swimmer. On top of that, Jinbe has stated several times that he plans to join the Strawhat crew; if this occurs, it will further reduce the need for other strong swimmers, given the fishmen's definite superiority in this realm.

**To wrap things up:** Oda has thrown us some really crazy curve balls in the past, so none of this is to say that this scenario will actually happen. However, given his abilities, fighting style, and role within the plot, Sanji is definitely the best candidate to receive the powers of the Mera Mera no Mi. Giving Sanji the fruit is a simple, elegant, and well-foreshadowed way for Oda to advance the plot, improve the crew, and flesh out one of the most important characters in the story. 

*EDIT: I forgot to mention my theory regarding how Sanji will end up receiving the fruit. I wrote out the scenario in a response to the comment by u/hawksfan81 but I'll also put it up here so it can be seen with the rest of the theory:*

*If Sanji does eat the fruit, I don't see him actively choosing to do so, but rather, choosing to do so out of dire necessity. I imagine him fighting an enemy in Doflamingo's castle (possibly Trébol?). He'll be losing pretty badly, due to leg injuries. Just when it seems like he's going to be defeated or killed, he'll be hit hard enough to crash through the floor, into the room holding the Mera Mera no Mi. Seeing it as his only chance to win his battle, he'll take a bite of the fruit and defeat the enemy at the last minute.*

People already ""know"" who is going to fight who like how Luffy will fight Black Beard, Ussop will fight [Van Auger](http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Van_Augur) and that Chopper will fight [Doc Q](http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Doc_Q) (because he is a doctor). But I feel like that Oda as usual will mix things up. I think that Ussop will end up fighting [Sanjuan Wolf](http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Sanjuan_Wolf) instead of Van Augur for 3 reasons. 
1. Ussop's dream is not necessarily to become the world's greatest sniper but rather a brave warrior of the sea
2. It parallels the story of David vs. Goliath perfectly (David even fights the giant with a slingshot)
3. Ussop has always viewed giants as the ultimate form of brave warriors and for Ussop to defeat a giant version of a giant would definitely mark his transformation into a brave warrior of the sea.

Also I feel like Chopper should fight Van Augur the Ultimate sniper/hunter of animals because,
1.Chopper's fear of humans comes from him being shot at when he was younger
2.It would be funny for the roles to be reversed, the hunter becomes the hunted.

....That is all
(give me your opinions I just would prefer to have Ussop Standing on top of Wolf's head screaming about how is the greatest warrior of the sea rather than ussop beating up van augur and then shouting about his sniping skills. but either way it will be epic.)"	t5_2rfz5	True

I spent about four months watching the show through the spring of my senior year of high school and into the summer before college. My best friend Brian was skeptical of the show when I showed him a random episode. The one where [Spoiler](/s ""the crew first meets Bon Clay and he becomes their friend before Alabasta""). He didn't take to it at first. But then I get to [Spoiler](/s ""Thriller Bark"") and he's over at my house almost 24/7. We would sit in my garage and watch episode after episode together. His favorite character was Usopp, and Chopper he thought was sort of stupid. 

We watched until we were completely caught up in the show. By then I was in the Dorms at school, and Brian had just taken a medical leave from his school. He became part of my suite pretty much, over all the time to watch One Piece with me. We watched through [Spoiler](/s ""The War of The Best"") with anticipation at what every episode's cliffhanger would lead to. 

Soon we were living together in an apartment. We watched One Piece when we could, but it became a bit more sporadic. He had started catching up in the anime, starting from the beginning to pick up what he missed. The last episode I watched with him was the episode before [Spoiler](/s ""Luffy takes out the pacifista with Haki after the Time Skip""). That was the last episode Brian ever watched.

He killed himself on November 15th, 2011. And now as that anniversary approaches, I recall those days watching One Piece with my Nakama. I've since read the Manga and am completely caught up. I see where his favorite character has advanced, and it makes me sad. I wish he were here to see how bad ass Chopper has become. 

The last time I remember seeing him really laugh was after I showed him this link that I found on this subreddit:
http://imgur.com/aIaFk

One Piece carries the memories of Brian to me, and that is why I watch it. It's bittersweet, but something that has become almost sacred. Sorry for the vent. Just one of those days.

1341547854.0	w43jb	Something I have noticed about Sanji (Spoilers up to and including Thriller Bark)	architta	161	14	80	"So I might just be stating the obvious here, but to start of I wanna say that I think that everyone in the crew has a primary role and a secondary role (or even multiple) For example - with Zoro, he is the swordsman in the crew, but he is also in my opinion the First-Mate. He is definitely ""Captain Material."" Or in another case, Nami - she might be the Navigator, but she is also in many ways the common sense (or general knowledge/watch-dog) of the crew. I can think of things like this for most other crew members.

Anyways this brings me to Sanji. ""Black-leg Sanji."" He has one of the coolest of these secondary roles. Ever notice that Sanji, is usually doing things for the crew that is sort of ""behind the scene?"" He is always sneaking around and acts like a Spy/Agent for the crew. Sanji seems to remain hidden at the perfect moment from big enemies. A few examples: 

Little Garden - Around Little garden is really the final place where Oda makes final tweaks on his characters. This is where Zoro started to get lost, and where Sanji first starts his Role. When Crocodile calls Mr 2, Sanji acts as Mr. 3 and answers the Den-Den Mushi


Albasta: Since Sanji was never seen by Crocodile, so he was able to take on the role of ""Mr. Prince"" to save the crew.

Ennies Lobby: When they are about to leave, instead of fighting the marines like everyone else, Sanji does what he does best and goes to close the doors. Which again, saves their asses.

In another example, sanji's wanted poster does not have a real picture. Coincidence? I think oda is further supporting his ""agent"" role, by making it difficult for even the world government to identify him. Since they have pictures of everyone else and but sanji, they might not recognize Sanji at first sight. 

Finally at Thriller bark, at the end when Zoro is passed out and Luffy is fine. Sanji investigates the two people that witnessed it and tells them to keep it a secret. Again he is indirectly protecting the crew ""behind the scene.""

Again, I might just be pointing out things everyone already knows, but let me know what you guys think of this.

**EDIT**
Some more examples:

Water 7: Sanji sneaks aboard the sea-train and leaves a den-den mushi for nami

Skypeia: Sanji messes with the gears on Enel's ship and ends up saving Nami and Usopp

Also *Spoilers for timeskip* Sanji's new picture after the two years time skip doesn't show his face again, further supporting the idea that Oda is giving him this role.

**Second Edit**
Also a lot of people are saying that I am making Sanji out to be a 007 or that Robin is the Spy. Well I chose the words spy/agent due to a lack of better terms. I would say more of Special ops I guess? But I mean he isn't like an action spy or anything. He just seems to be good at getting into situations where he is able to save the crew or even save a lot of fighting/time. As for Robin, I do agree that she has more of a spy type role, but I think she is more of a information provider. It goes along with her historian role. 

And since a lot of people have been discussing the secondary roles of the other crew memebers, I thought I would give my thoughts on it as well. Although some of these might be ""iffy""

Luffy: Captain + Inspiration (He is the reason that everyone else is following their dreams) + He provides the crew with confides + More (luffy has many roles, as the Captain should, so its hard to pin him down to just a few

Zoro: Swordsman + First-mate

Nami: Navigator + Common Sense (she watches over the crew and makes sure they don't do anything stupid)

Usopp: Sniper + Strategy

Sanji: Cook + Spec Ops

Chopper: Doctor + ""Emergency Food Supply""(Pet) + ""Child-like Spirit"" (DesusWalks -- I am not really sure on the pet aspect for Chopper so I got this from DesusWalks' post in the comment)

Robin: Archaeologist + Informant 

Franky: Shipwright + Demolition-man (Not quite sure here, we haven't seen as much of Franky to determine his role that easily, we've also seen him build stuff for others and he builds the weapons, but that could just go along with being the shipwright)

Brooke: Musician +  random-comic-relief guy(I honestly have no idea, I feel that Brooke really hasn't developed a role yet, so I am just going to say ""random-comic-relief guy"" because he does random things

I couldn't help but notice the [base of the statue looked familiar](http://www.mangapanda.com/one-piece/704/18), it seems a lot like a poneglyph. So what about this:

Kyros was a gladiator that took only one blow in 3000 battles.

My theory is that Gol D. Roger was the man who beat Kyros and had him join him in his journey. 

Roger also found the poneglyph in the island, he could interpret the Poneglyph because he had the ability to ""hear the voice of all things"".

However, he didn't want to leave the treasure of lost history laying around (as the WG would want them destroyed), so he turned the poneneglyph into a statue of Kyros, he disguised it.

Later in the arc we may see the statue getting destroyed, thus revealing the poneglyph underneath so Robin will read it.

I also think there is a connection between Rebecca and Kyros, based on the look she gave the statue, when she said she liked it. If Kyros was her father it would explain why she is a strong fighter in the colosseum.

TL;DR: The statue hides a poneglyph underneath."	t5_2rfz5	True

1362242106.0	19iznb	The New Admirals [Theory]	TheLawG14	162	29	66	"So, I've been reading around the forums and I've put together some of the admiral infomation/theories I've been seeing. Together, it looks very plausible. 

Let's first go over the name ""Fujitora"" which Sakazuki sends out to go deal with Law and Luffy. Fuji is a type of purple color while tora means tiger. Hence, the nickname means ""Purple Tiger"". This is parallel to some of the other admiral names we know (""Blue Pheasant"" - Aokiji, ""Yellow Monkey"", Kizaru). So it's pretty obvious this guy is an admiral.

Furthermore, there will be four admirals. We know who the first one is (Kizaru), and we know who the second one is (Fujitora). So, what makes me think there will be two more? Well, check this out:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nue

Head - Monkey, Body - Tanuki, Legs - Tiger, Tail - Snake. Kizaru stands for ""Yellow Monkey""..he's also the only admiral that's from pre-ts so it makes sense as to why he would be the ""head"" of these new admirals and the strongest. The legs is tiger...just like Fugitora! So that leaves snake and body. Well, that's where I get to the last part of the theory.

Red + Blue = Purple/Violet                             
Blue + Yellow = Green             
Red + Yellow = Orange         
                                                                                                                                                                   
These are the secondary colors. In Pre-TS, Oda made use of the primary colors...so why not this era make use of the secondary colors with a primary color at the head? Purple is already occupied by Fujitora, so the remaining admirals could be ""Green Snake"" and ""Orange Tanuki""

Tl;dr - There are four admirals and they are ""Kizaru"", ""Fujitora"", ""Green Snake"", and ""Orange Tanuki"".

1375269990.0	1jexx5	SUPER crazy theory about Thousand Sunny	derekvolker	160	26	54	"It's a crazy twist but i like how it sounds. Given the fact that Franky could memorize the blueprints of Pluton (that no one saw the content before, maybe Tom but he), the fact that Pluton is a ship, Franky built numerous battle ships in his youth (even capable of beating a Sea King) and Thousand Sunny is the first ship since Oro Jackson made of Adam Wood, my theory is that Thousand Sunny is in fact a SUPER version of Pluton.

Franky used the original schema (which could be big as Noah), resize it and add SUPER features as the Coup de Burst. I mean, the Gaon Cannon was used just once and was pretty destructible. I guess that if it was used with a different fuel and against an island it could be as destructive as a buster call. If it really is, at the endgame, after found the one piece and surrounded by several enemies, Nami or Zoro could say something like:
- We could use an Ancient Weapon right now.
Only to Franky reply:
- Ow! But we have a SUPER Ancient Weapon!
And then proceed to Usopp shoots the Gaon Cannon against every single enemy boat while Franky commands it: Right, Left, Right, Left!

TL, DR: Thousand Sunny is the Ancient Weapon Pluton and Franky didn't told anyone about it because he is waiting for a punch line."	t5_2rfz5	True

1. Maybe we can make an official thread of frequently asked questions and answers Ex: How to get my friend into onepiece, Where can i get merch, what happens when brook goes in the ocean or has seastone on, etc.

2. ........

i had more but they seemed to have slipped my mind right now if u guys think of any good ideas ill put them on here and maybe the mods will like to act on some of them.

The good news is that Onepiece content is making it on to the Front Page, whether it be from /r/funny or other subreddits. A **WHOLE** lot of people are starting to read/watch Onepiece. This is good news. **BUT!** They come to this subreddit too.

They want to check things out, ask questions about this series. 

Now, redditors being redditors, they will *not* read the rules. Some will, some won't. Some will try to, but forget.

Here is the bad news. One of our **major** rules are to *not* post memes on this subreddit. I've seen those new people post memes, then get downvoted. A lot.

These people have just got here, and if want more people to start reading Onepiece (WHICH WE **DO** WANT), then we've got to be more polite. Nicer. We already are, but still. This is a special occasion.

See memes on the subreddit? ~~Don't downvote (or at least keep the number of votes *positive*),~~ just politely comment (or PM) that memes aren't allowed on this subreddit. It just means that there are new people coming to this subreddit and starting to read/watch Onepiece. This won't last forever, only a few weeks.

I've also noticed that a **lot** of people haven't been using the [Spoiler Tag] (#s ""Don't look at these if new to the series."") lately. Let's be careful, as to some people lose interest if they get spoiled.

I'd like to welcome the new people to this subreddit.

Thanks for reading.

Edit: I was tired last night, couldn't think straight; didn't debate with myself. Can we all let go of me saying that we shouldn't downvote?"	t5_2rfz5	True

1363882668.0	1aqm71	We Are The One Piece Podcast, AMA!	OnePiecePodcast	146	17	527	"We are The One Piece Podcast. We started on May 31, 2009, bringing you information about the latest chapters and episodes of One Piece. Since we began we have put together a crew from around the world: from Japan, from California, from New York, through Europe, Russia, and beyond. Each week we have the latest One Piece news, the latest reviews, and we take questions and comments from fans.

OUR SITE: http://onepiecepodcast.com
https://twitter.com/OnePiecePodcast/status/314773017962115072

We have had guests from FUNimation including J. Michael Tatum (Eneru), Mike McFarland (Buggy/ADR Dir), Chris Sabat (Zoro), Eric Vale (Sanji), Colleen Clinkenbeard (Luffy), Sonny Strait (Usopp), Patrick Seitz (Franky), Brina Palencia (Chopper), and many more. We have also had representatives from VIZ Media, Weekly Shonen Jump, and FUNimation Entertainment.

**TL;DR**: We are here to answer any questions you may have about podcasting, One Piece, the fandom, anime, or anything else you want to field at us. We'll probably be going until around 6PM ET, and we'll start answering questions at 2PM ET.

There are a lot of us, but not all of us are around to answer questions, we have...

* **Zach** - Host and Founder - AMA, until 6PM ET
* **Ed** - Co-Host and Co-Founder - AMA until 4:30PM ET
* **Stephen** - Contributor/Translator for One Piece - AMA until 6PM ET
* **The Dude** - One Piece Music Expert/Cool Guy - AMA until 6PM ET
* **Steve** - Artist/Con Guy/Co-Host - AMA until 2:30PM ET
