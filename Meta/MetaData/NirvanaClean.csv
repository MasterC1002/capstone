He was very dear to every Nirvana fan that came into contact with him and would constantly write letters back and forth to fans worldwide. He would allow anyone inside of his home when they needed to talk or just browse Kurt Cobain photos and other memorabilia.

Leland was the only surviving Cobain family member left that was open to the Nirvana fans and wanted to hear what they had to say when it came to discussing Kurt’s death or his life history before or during the Nirvana years.

1342917510.0	wy2vs	The day I met Nirvana	mattyparanoid	125	11	19	"Posted originally in /r/lookwhoimet/ and someone suggested that I repost here. Pic proof at the bottom.

I was stationed in Tokyo in the 1990's. I remember buying Nevermind at the BX and being blown away by it. When I saw they were coming to Tokyo I managed to get tickets. A buddy and I rode the train into Central Tokyo and got in line for the show. There were many English speaking people in line along with a slew of Japanese of course.

And here's where it gets mildly interesting. As we were talking to the people in front of us a couple of people came up to my friend and I and asked us if we were the contest winners. Without missing a beat (and quite atypical of my personality) we both looked at them and emphatically said, ""YES! We are...""

They said, ""Come with us, you don't have to wait in line. Here are your backstage passes. We'll show you to your seats."" The girl in front of us just stared at us with her jaw hanging down and didn't say a word as we left the line and headed past everyone into the show. She was totally aware that we were not the contest winners as we had been talking to her about how bad our seats were just before they came up to us. Thanks Canadian girl for not cock-blocking us!

We got into the venue (my first Tokyo concert) and what shocked me immediately was that it was so quiet. The hall was 75% full and you could have had a normal conversation without any effort. In fact as we crossed the threshold my friend and I both started whooping and shouting out in excitement which startled our handlers and made them look back at us in mild amusement at these crazy gaijing making all that noise. You could feel the eyes on us as we sheepishly settled down into our seats.

2-3 rows back, center!!!!!

We made it through the show (FUCKING AMAZING SET) without anyone coming to take away our amazing seats and haul us out of there. I didn't stop looking over my should for security until near the last song.

At the end of the show we headed over to the side of the stage half expecting to be denied and the huge sumo wrestler looking security just opened the gate and welcomed us through. Once inside another handler took us back to the dressing room and in through a small door and bam, there they were; Novoselic, Cobain and Grohl.

Kurt was in the middle of a large group of giggling Japanese girls, Krist was standing off to the side with an American girl and Dave was on the other side of the room tearing off his clothes saying, ""girls, where are the girls. We need to get out of here and find some girls..."" This made my buddy and me laugh and we wished him luck as he literally tore out of the room half dressed shouting at his bandmates to come on.

Krist then asked us where we were from and we told him that we were American Military stationed there and he was really nice. The girl he was with was incredibly jealous of him being nice to us and her body language and harumphing was really lame but it didn't detract from him having a nice conversation with us wherein I asked him why they did not play ""Something in the Way"". He indicated that it was hard to do live with the cello and all. Great guy who spent a nice few minutes in genuine chat.

At some point I managed to get a small window of opportunity to have a minute with Kurt and we took the picture. I expressed my sadness that they did not play ""Something in the Way"" to him and he seemed pleased that I liked that song and was sorry they could not play it.

My buddy, in seeing that I was finally chatting with Kurt came up to us both and said, ""We're in the Air Force, but it's cool...We still do drugs"" And I just looked at him like, ""Are you fucking serious?!?!?"" (Haven't done drugs my entire career and neither had he) I don't know what his problem was and why he said that to this day. We never spoke of his temporary insanity and I chalk it up to being star-struck.

Needless to say it ended the conversation much to my chagrin. At any rate it was at exactly that moment that ""The Smashing Pumpkins"" walked in to the dressing room minus D'arcy.

As were standing next to Kurt they immediately came right up to us and quite oddly made fun of my Nine Inch Nails shirt. They were pompous and indignant the entire time. We asked for pictures and were granted the moment but Billy said, ""I'm gonna make my rock star pose"" in a snide way and was generally an ass to us.

I was really bummed at the way they treated us as I really, really liked their music at that point. Right after that they all bailed. As they were all walking out Krist said to me, ""Take some of this stuff with you, we don't want any of it/aren't taking it. He pointed to a long buffet table filled with gifts and food.

We each took a shopping bag of things from that table. I still have a small sake cup with gold inlay from that night to this day.

And that is how I met Nirvana.

Whenever you get a close up of his left hand (his strumming hand) you see this really nice patterns. By altering these patterns when you decide to play a Nirvana song actually makes it sound different.

Like for example, it's a classic example that I've seen. The strumming of the main riff to smells like teen spirit, aka the Chorus and beginning riff. 

By starting with a downstroke, it gives a different feel, a more metal band playing Nirvana feel to it, with an unpinpointable gap in sound when going through the riff. 

In reality, Kurt starts with an upstroke which closes up the gaps you'd find when playing it downstroke.

In general I've noticed Kurt has an affection for mostly upstrokes.

In addition if you've ever watched him play he definitely moves the guitar with his right hand on the neck up and down to aid in strumming"	t5_2qman	True

• The opening song you played in Argentina with Nirvana in October of 1992, was that just a jam or was it a cover? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2cJ7_ly6hY  (PS, this YouTube channel has a ton of old Nirvana videos, in case you wanna relive some memories ;P)

Dave: I don't have the foggiest recollection of that song, but my guess is that if you don't know it - I don't know it.

• Did you guys actually play a cover of We Will Rock You by Queen at this show? (This was at the Hollywood Rock Festival in São Paulo during January of 1993, you can find more information [here](http://nirvanaguide.com/1993.php#show_930116)) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu-EFWhq_8g 

Dave: Did we?

• How was your bum after the fire here? http://i.imgur.com/of1TjIx.jpg 

Dave: Ask Steve Albini

I wish I thought of some better questions, but I am so glad he answered my questions. I just thought I would share it with you guys.

I know, I know, it was in the friggin title, but hey, I was a pretty little kid to be listening to such music.

But what got me absolutely hooked was driving with my dad in the middle of the night, listening to the local volunteer radio station.

and then the Unplugged version of About A Girl came on.

I had no idea who it was, but I NEEDED to know.  I learned it from memory on guitar when I got home (how I also learned to play open G), and played it every day.  I asked people if they knew it, but I could only remember the lyrics at the part with ""well, I can't see you every night, free..."" so I would hum the rest.

Then my friend had me listen to Nirvana MTV Unplugged.  

AND GUESS.  WHAT THE FIRST SONG WAS.

This is not true, Kurt had the ""Polly said"" lyric in the long before it was even recorded when the song had been written and played during the Bleach-era. For example, here is a video of them playing the song two years before Nevermind came out when they were still relatively unknown : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35RmEzYQ8GI The clip, while pretty old, was only recently just released but sure enough you can hear Kurt say ""Polly said"". There are several videos you can find of concerts from before Nevermind where he also utters this line. So, unless Kurt fucks up the lyrics every single time he played it live, this was always intended in the song. Just thought I'd clear that up for everyone!"	t5_2qman	True

I tried to move that Son of a gun but I could not so I sat and played with Polly. I turn on the TV and see stories on all the Territorial Pissings going on in the world and I realize watching it will do nothing but turn me into a Negative Creep. I hear another story About a Girl who Smells like Teen Spirit but her Love Buzz will Drain You. So I went out the back door and decided to Drive by the Old School and I tell you it gave me a Shiver I had never Been a Son like I should have and I started to feel Dumb I knew I should Stay Away but I had too offer All Apologies. I called her and told her that the flowers were In Bloom. She told me to simply Come as you are.
Being on a plane I knew Jesus wants me for for a sunbeam. Such a long flight will Drain you. While I sip a hot cup of Penny royal Tea I Milk it too make it last. When the plane landed and Before I dealt with business I went looking for Molly's Lips. I was feeling that Love Buzz. Her Heart shaped box Blew my mind and I knew I had to find her. Someone tapped my shoulder and told me to Turn Around It was pretty scary when I saw her. I almost had a Meltdown with those sweet words Here I am, Rape me. In the end it was all About a girl I simply came for the wrong one. One look at her and I knew I would serve the Servants and Spank through My Disco Goddess because she truly made me Happy. We had some Mexican Seafood that night. It was the Blandest I've had ever had. I felt Sappy when we laid down to Breed and as the Play by Play went through my mind I felt Paper cuts in my brain. The Aneurysm took me out and my world faded. I saw no God I saw no Devil. I only saw Floyd the Barber On a high Plateau. I asked, are you The man who sold the world? He looked puzzled and say Oh Me? I live here, In our Lake of fire why Where did you sleep last night

Sub-Pop signed some contract giving Nirvana to Geffen, I hear that Sub-Pop then got ten percent of everything.

Thus forcing Geffen to scramble hard and do a lot of creative Hollywood accounting, to make sure that Sub-Pop's ""ten percent"" was as small as possible.

Given a budget of $65,000 by Geffen, Nirvana recorded Nevermind at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California in May and June 1991.  Dunno how many 'points' Butch Vig might have gotten, or if that was a flat fee.

When you sell a million records, retailers get half and record companies get a third.   What about when you sell ten million  (RIAA Diamond Certification) ??

Nirvana did a lot of touring and a lot of shows. 

=== === === === === ===

Has Courtney Love been getting all the songwriter royalties?

**edit**: i think Courtney sold off her royalties to some company in 2006 . Courtney did recieve most of the royalties (50% before she sold it probably less because Frances also got some of the royalties i think 5% not much) while dave and krist make 25%.

“We’re told Courtney sold off half of her rights to Kurt’s music to a company called Primary Wave Music… [and] gave Primary Wave the exclusive right to distribute Nirvana’s entire catalog.”

Source: http://blog.seattlepi.com/thebigblog/2012/03/14/courtney-love-kermit-the-frog-raped-kurt-cobains-memory/

I also heard somewhere that Kurt had about $3-4 Million at the time of his death and if he did Lollapalooza in 1994 the contract was worth i think around $11 Million

=== === === === ===

The only hint I have so far is Kurt writing in his Journal, ""I made five million dollars this year""  (in 1992).

=== === 

Does anyone know of an article somewhere which does an OK job of breaking down where the money went?

=== === ===

Nevermind was released on September 24, 1991. American record stores received an initial shipment of 46,251 copies, while 35,000 copies were shipped in the United Kingdom, where Bleach had been successful. The lead single ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" had been released on September 10 with the intention of being a base-building cut among alternative rock fans, while the next single ""Come as You Are"" would be the song that would possibly garner more attention. The band set out on a short American tour four days before the release date to support the album. Geffen Records hoped that Nevermind would sell around 250,000 copies, which was the same level the record company had achieved with Sonic Youth's Geffen debut Goo. The best estimate was that if all involved worked hard, the record could possibly be certified Gold by September 1992.

The album debuted on the Billboard 200 at number 144. Geffen shipped about half of the initial US pressing to the American Northwest, where it sold out quickly and was unavailable for days. Geffen reputedly put production of all other albums on hold in order to fulfill demand in the region. Nevermind was already selling well but, over the next few months, the momentum increased significantly as ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" unexpectedly became more and more popular. The song's video had received a world premiere on MTV's late night alternative show 120 Minutes but it soon proved so popular that the channel began playing it during the day. The record was soon certified gold, but the band was relatively uninterested in the achievement. Novoselic recalled, ""Yeah I was happy about it. It was pretty cool. It was kind of neat. But I don't give a shit about some kind of achievement like that. It's cool—I guess.""

As the band set out for their European tour at the start of November 1991, Nevermind entered the Billboard Top 40 for the first time at number 35. By this point, ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" had become a genuine hit and the album was selling so fast none of Geffen's marketing strategies aimed at different sales levels could be enacted. Geffen president Ed Rosenblatt told The New York Times, ""We didn't do anything. It was just one of those 'Get out of the way and duck' records."" Nirvana found as they toured Europe during the end of 1991 that the shows were dangerously oversold, television crews became a constant presence onstage, and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" was almost omnipresent on radio and music television.

Nevermind became Nirvana's first number one album on January 11, 1992, replacing Michael Jackson at the top of the Billboard charts. By this time, Nevermind was selling approximately 300,000 copies a week. ""Come as You Are"" was finally released as the second single in March 1992; it peaked at number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Two more singles, ""Lithium"" and ""In Bloom"", were released from the album.

Nevermind was certified Gold and Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in November 1991, and was certified Diamond in March 1999."	t5_2qman	True

When you take away the drug addiction and look at him as a person, he's still one of the greatest men that ever lived. He even said in his suicide note that he was not 100% happy doing what he was doing anymore, but still got up on stage and acted like he was having the time of his life, and he did it for the fans that he loved so much. Nirvana wasn't just some band, they defined the term ""grunge"" to me at least. They formed a new kind of music that some even attempted at one point or another, but Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and David Grohl all three of them made the 90's a great decade for music.

#5: Breed

While fairly simple, it holds a certain excitement and craziness that I love. 

#4: In Bloom:

An intense distortion-filled love fest. While In Bloom isn't a favorite song of mine, I really dig the solo. 

#3: Stain

While I think it might be two guitars over-dubbed, the harmonies in this one are really neat. This is a Kurt classic of repeating a similar lick a few times, with slight variations.

#2: Serve The Servants

This one has a very classic rock feel to it. One of his more complex solos, surrounded by a great song. This is a part you gotta air-guitar with. 

#1: Spank Thru

This is probably gonna be the most controversial of my picks, but Spank Thru's solo is probably my favorite.  The dissonance and tone feed into a rousing break that makes Spank Thru one my top ten Nirvana songs. I love this solo so much.

I recently read Kurt's reasoning behind the song in an old RS interview:


&gt;RS: The song on ""In Utero"" that has whipped up the most controversy is ""Rape Me."" It's got a brilliant hook, but there have been objections to the title and lyric — not just from skittish DJs but from some women who feel it's rather cavalier for a man to be using such a potent, inflammatory word so freely.

&gt;**KC: I understand that point of view, and I've heard it a lot. I've gone back and forth between regretting it and trying to defend myself. Basically, I was trying to write a song that supported women and dealt with the issue of rape. Over the last few years, people have had such a hard time understanding what our message is, what we're trying to convey, that I just decided to be as bold as possible. How hard should I stamp this point? How big should I make the letters?**

&gt;**It's not a pretty image. But a woman who is being raped, who is infuriated with the situation ... it's like ""Go ahead, rape me, just go for it, because you're gonna get it."" I'm a firm believer in karma, and that motherfucker is going to get what he deserves, eventually. That man will be caught, he'll go to jail, and he'll be raped. ""So rape me, do it, get it over with. Because you're gonna get it worse.""**

First of all, I ♥ KC for even attempting to support women in this way.  I would argue that the confusion around the song, coupled with the frustrating confusion around the issue of sexual consent (how some people STILL dont know what consent looks like), gives the song a multi-layered meaning. (I also wish Do Re Mi had been official, since it's a heterograph for Don't Rape Me and would have been a nice sister song to Rape Me)

I admit, as a woman who pays attention to rape awareness and prevention, I had never thought about framing the issue as Kurt has. But maybe others have? Is Kurt presenting a viable feminist viewpoint on rape? For sure, he is attempting to see the issue from a woman's perspective. But when confronted with violence are women immediately thinking about karmic retribution? I find it interesting because I've been seeing more attention to retribution lately through [slogans like this](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4rl94ocgj1rn77m7o1_500.jpg). 

Here is Amanda Marcotte's view of the song:
&gt;Many of the women interviewed initially found “Rape Me” an unsettling song, but eventually came around to seeing it as Cobain’s clumsy but well-intentioned attempt to incorporate feminist theory into his worldview. It’s one of the few songs in all of rock history to acknowledge rape as a crime of power and violation, instead of excessive sexual desire. Many feminists object to using rape as a metaphor this way, but what was undeniable was Cobain’s extreme hostility to the possessive mentality that leads to rape."	t5_2qman	True

Watched it with some movie buff friends last night but didn't know until after that Kurt (and Elliot Smith) had said it was his favorite film. Since it's about an estranged father reconnecting with his young son (who coincidentally looks just like a young Kurt), it kind of made sense after the fact.

Personally, it upsets me because to the extent that I emotionally identify with this band and the personalities of the members, they're also kind of criticizing / belittling me and my feelings. One could just as easily make fun of stereotypical 80s hair bands for being about partying and girls girls girls.

I guess I usually say nothing, or say that it's not up to anyone else to judge the feelings Kurt went through. I also point out that they're freaking hilarious people if you watch their interviews, and that in addition to maybe expressing some negative emotion, they were so totally crazy and uninhibited and intense on stage, and that's something to relate to and enjoy independent of what they were expressing."	t5_2qman	True

When it came out, I thought it was all the singles Nirvana released, and a couple tracks off of the unplugged record. Little did I know, it barely scratched the surface. The record went on the shelf in lieu of the two records that sounded more together. 

I know Nirvana a hell of a lot better now, and looking back, what were they fucking thinking? People say that Nirvana was a bit eclectic, and their sound changed quite a bit from record to record, and it would be difficult to mix them together into anything cohesive,  but fuck that! Including split releases and promotional singles, the band released 21 songs, and you know what? They fit onto a single disc (&lt;80 minutes). 

1. ""Love Buzz""
2. ""Sliver""
3. ""Here She Comes Now""
4. ""Oh, the Guilt""
5. ""Molly's Lips""
6. ""Smells Like Teen Spirit""
7. ""Come As You Are""
8. ""Lithium""
9. ""In Bloom""
10. ""On a Plain""
11. ""Heart Shaped Box""
12. ""Rape Me""
13. ""All Apologies""
14. ""Pennyroyal Tea (Remix)""
15. ""About a Girl (Unplugged)""
16. ""Man Who Sold the World (Unplugged)""
17. ""Lake of Fire (Unplugged)""
18. ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night? (Unplugged)""
19. ""Drain You (Live)""
20. ""Aneurysm (Live)""
21. ""You Know You're Right""

So there are six covers on this, six live tracks, and it is all over the place, but this honestly covers the band's entire career, shows the odd places the found musical inspiration, shows what the band was like before their godlike success, and takes advantage of the fact that a CD is much longer than an hour.

What's the consensus among the harder-core Nirvana fans? I'm turned off by the somewhat lazy and uninteresting arrangement of the guitar, bass, and drums all playing the same rhythm in unison. Also, the guitar tone seems to be saying, ""Listen, we can still sound like a garage band recording on a four-track!"". To me, it doesn't work so well. It seems so two-dimensional in comparison to the depth and harmonies at work in other songs from In Utero.

I had a chance to go see Eyes Adrift a few years ago and was so excited. I was getting to see a member of Nirvana, Sublime, and the Meat Puppets. I was up close to the stage mostly for the show but my pictures lack better quality, sorry. Anyways, after the show I waited for what seemed like forever by the bus. No one was coming out except for a roadie a few times. Bud, the drummer (Sublime &amp; Eyes Adrift) opened up the door and signed my ticket. Was pretty stoked about that. A while longer and the roadie came out again and we gave him a piece of paper that had my website address on it (I used to run a pretty decent Nirana fan site). He also took my copy Bleach on CD onto the bus. 

About half an hour later, or what seemed like 5 hours, the crowd around the bus died down to about 5 people including my two friends and I. I was leaning up against the bus door when it opened and I almost fell over. I looked up and there was Krist. He hugged me and thanked me for the web address and handed me my Bleach CD, signed. I was just about ready to pass out from being nervous and shy. I'm pretty sure that was one of the most awesome moments of my life. So glad I waited outside of that bus as long as I did."	t5_2qman	True

Nirvana was, in my opinion, for the kids, but since I loved (which is an eufenism for the feeling that a teenager has towards opposing sexs (in most cases) genitalia) my 'woman' I bought her the shirt. I got [something lame like this](http://rlv.zcache.com/life_is_pain_merry_christmas_tshirt-p235330876208697504c2i7_152.jpg) in return.

It's funny that I never really appreciated Nirvana until I broke up with her, but after all the years, kids, marriage, somehow I have come to the point where I like Nirvana. Maybe it is because I have found God?

The 90s was a shit of an decade. Luckily I don't remember much of it. But still for some reason, when I see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QECJ9pCyhns I say to my wife; 'that is kinda cool sweater'. And the next christmas I get a similar sweater from my mother-in-law."	t5_2qman	True

The transition between Bleach to Nevermind isa real puzzle to me. When you look at the style (as well as quality) of songs on Bleach, there's a big difference between the style (and quality) of tracks on Nevermind.  

there's a world of difference (both musically and lyrically between Big Cheese, Mr Mostauche and swap meat and tunes like Polly, lithium, something in the way and lounge act.

Sure there's lovely songs like about a girl, school and blew (on bleach), I hope my point is being made. Maybe it was the result of exposure to more non-punk bands. Maybe it was to touring and seeing more of the world. You know ? "	t5_2qman	True

I'd much rather have something that contains them playing Dive or Milk It from this era rather than a very commercial concert that essentially only encompasses hits (not that this is a bad thing, but I've heard every Nirvana single about a million times each). Anyone have ideas for an In Utero show that would be a better candidate? Surely the Live and Loud one isn't the only In Utero concert with professional video recording.

It wasn't the loud echo's of the crowd that phased him, or the overhead stage lights that blinded him, it was that fucking smell. /Always./ He gives a look to his fellow band mates; his loyal, long haired bassist gives him a cock-eyed little nod, before scratching his goatee. Followed by a glance back to the fateful drummer, the younger guy with the 'rocker hair' that waved about like mad with each solo. He too gave a little nod, giving his snare drum a tap in reply.

""Well. Here goes nothing.."" He murmured to himself over the jeers of the audience, shifting his hands along the neck of his guitar. finding the right chords to burst into the introduction of a power-heavy song. Rich with snappy bass riffs, and a chorus just catchy enough to make even the grouchiest owner appretiate the 'grunge', even if for a few minutes. The lyrics were about love, loss, and probably some older relationship he had some few years ago. Did anyone think deep into it? No, they just rocked their heads, flailed their arms, and enjoyed the music. One song, after the next. A few cover songs were even mixed in, some band from Edin-bo..borough? Edinburgh? Bah, who the hell cares, it was good music as well.

Apparantly the story goes that this rag-tag group of 'punk' lovers grew up around some piss-poor town outside of Seattle, go figure, with all of the talent flooding into music from the upper, and lower west coast. Some sort of pig latin, ridiculous name for a band too. But then again, what band in the early to late 1990's didn't have some wierd name with a serious, cynical meaning to it. The show would go on for a couple more hours, this new band getting into the music into the later songs of their set. Till finally, they celebrated by smashing up their instruments, and equipment. Listen here kiddo, there was only one man able to do that, and do it well. I'll give you a hint, his last name was Townshend, and he wrote some fantastic music.
