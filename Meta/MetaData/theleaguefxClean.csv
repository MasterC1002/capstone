As the title says. Request gifs. I use photoshop to make gifs so they are high quality. 

Request format:

* Season: 
* Episode:
* Describe scene:
* What you want in the gif: 
* Size:
* Speed:    
    
    
If you don't know which season or episode then just give your best description. 

I'll do my best to make it exactly how you want. 

I prefer to only do clips from the show, not youtube clips of related things. Only request gifs from The League, please. 

I'll do them ASAP. If asking for a gif please reply either to one of my comments or directly to the thread so I can get a notification. 

All gifs will have a small ""reddit.com/r/theleaguefx"" watermark along the bottom. It will hopefully help out the subreddit. 

If you want a gif from the most recent episode wait until 2 hours AFTER it airs on the West Coast of the United States please. I don't want spoilers as notifications. I usually watch it before it even airs on the west coast but just to be safe. If you ignore this I will not make your gif and I will call you an asshole. 

Please check through the comments to see if your request is already fulfilled. 

Just so everyone knows, I welcome posting all of these gifs anywhere on reddit! I added the subreddit url to each one so if they do spread it might get more people to the subreddit! 
    
Here is a link to the full album of all gifs I have made! I will upload the gifs to there so when you see it it will be up to date always!

EDIT: I guess I should clarify - I'm more curious where I could get it legally than anything. Did anyone buy an episode online somewhere that doesn't require an account log-in before watching? See my problem is I bought season 3 on amazon so I can't link anyone to the video without giving them my Amazon information, which I don't want to do. All I want to do is find the clip in a commercial or something online to link to them or purchase another copy somewhere where I can legally share the file.

I love the show and so I'm happy to kick The League guys another $2 or $3 to buy an episode that has such a clip so I can send it to a friend, I'm just not sure where I could buy it besides Amazon or iTunes (which both don't generally let you share files) that might let me legally send a copy to a friend.

1375060018.0	1j8wnu	My thesis on The League	TheBeardedSeer	16	2	5	"Preface: So I decided to start watching this show two days ago after someone told a League joke and I didn't get it. I began watching and am currently about to finish the 3rd season. Throughout this wonderful binging, I couldn't help but notice a couple of recurring themes throughout the seasons that seemed so obvious that it had to mean something. So after much thought, I have finally concocted a thesis on what exactly The League is based around. And here it is:

Pete's Demise:
So the pilot introduces many important aspects of the show: we are introduced to many of the main characters, we begin to understand their commitment to their Fantasy Football League, we begin to map out the family/friend structures amongst the main characters, etc. The first thing we learn, however, is that Pete is the man at Fantasy Football; he's the first to speak in the pilot, he has won the league three times, he clearly is good at the game. We also see that he divorced his wife mid-episode. Now, as a cinephile, I know that climaxes do not come about this early, but I ignored it and continued to watch the show. But then, when I reached the third season, I realized that what was really happening was that the pilot was really the start of Pete's realization of how shitty and pointless his life is.

We can all agree that there are six main characters in the show, namely Pete, Kevin, Dre, Ruxin, Taco, and Jenny. So the first group we're going to talk about is Ruxin and Kevin and their character's versus Pete. Kevin is Pete's bestfriend and Jenny's husband as well as his daughter's father. Kevin is perceived in the show as this innocent do-gooder who has a stable job, a loving family, and a best friend. Pete loves Kevin, but is jealous of Jenny's complete control over him. Pete's perception of him can be seen by the way Kevin gets pushed around by her for everything and how he won't stand up for himself. Pete is self-conscious about his life compared to Kevin's because clearly Kevin has the most ideal life out of everyone else's and has everything Pete does not. Now the next in line in terms of a good life is Ruxin who is perceived as this annoying scumbag who is full of himself. Pete sees him really as this douche bag who is always pissing everyone off. But what really is happening is that Ruxin has a very good job, a really (really) hot wife, and a child! Ruxin has everything Pete does not, but why is he a douche bag and not Kevin. Because Kevin is an angel in Pete's eyes and doesn't really want to accept that Kevin has outgrown him. Ruxin on the other hand, was never really his best friend and, therefore, can be impure and an asshole.

Now the second set of characters: Taco and Dre. After Pete's divorce, Pete unknowingly stepped down to the level of the two characters who seem to be the biggest outliers in this whole show. Taco is seen as a fertada who somehow gets by without a stable job and is seen almost as a lost puppy who needs to be guided in the right direction. Pete does not see himself on his level and is why Taco is seen as such an outrageously imperfect human. However, Taco is a single man with an unsure profession who doesn't really have a partner in crime in the picture. Does that sound like someone? On the other side of the helpless spectrum, you have Dre who is a successful plastic surgeon, but also easily the most singled out individual in the group. Although he has a lot of money, Dre is picked on the most out of everybody for his strange fashion sense in behavior. The reason is because Pete really is more self conscious about being on Dre's level than he is on Taco's. Pete knows that he's a better person than Taco, but Dre is  touchy subject. So in order to bring himself above Dre, he perceives Dre as  this sad little man who is singled out as the weirdo by all the League. 

Now back to Pete. The reason why I believe that this is Pete's perception of his life after his divorce is because we don't really know too much about him. We hardly see anyone picking on him, we don't really know too much about his job or where he lives. Hell, I'm not even sure if he's ever been thrown over! I honestly believed that Pete was the coolest guy out of the bunch. 
But i was wrong. The story all comes together with the League. The episodes span from the beginning of the league to the end; in other words, the only time of the year where Pete finds a reason to live. The only thing we know that Pete is good at in life is Fantasy Football, so when the season comes around, the show starts up, just like Pete's life. Pete sees the League as the only thing that will bring him reason and the only thing that will bring his friends and him together, and thus the only thing keeping him together."	t5_2sws5	True

**TL;DR:** would the show be funnier if i knew what in the fuck they were talking about?

----

i fucking love this show. i think it's one of the best on tv right now, right up there with parks and rec. it outstrips 30 rock. i need more shows like the league, but i can't find any. oh well.

i know absolutely nothing about american football. or sports in general. i know a bit about basketball, i guess, but even when i used to love playing and wished to god i was better at it, i didn't follow NBA. barely knew names, knew nothing about stats.

sorry for the preamble. my question is: how much more would i enjoy the show if i loved sports and american football (i've never watched a game in my life and know absolutely nothing about the rules. do you have to pass the ball behind like in rugby? i know nothing about rugby either but i know that because we'd play with a football when we were kids it involved that one rule and then just beat the hell out of anybody in front of you until you ran the ball through the goal or you lost the ball) and followed the NFL and knew the names of the players and their stats and what have you?

i mean obviously i know i'd enjoy it more if i was immersed in the subject matter, the way asterix is funnier in the original french and the simpsons is funnier if you get the reference and family guy's funny if you have a frontal lobotomy, but *how much* better? do i have any idea what i'm missing? am i missing much?"	t5_2sws5	True

Let's make it interesting and fun. Everyone make a call on what they think the replacement will be (unless it's already out there somewhere, then you're a big fat cheater, hats off to you if you can fool everyone) and as soon as we find out what it is, the closest to the replacement gets to name the title of the subreddit, the mouseover text of the league logo in the top left, and the replacement pic of Ruxin ""WINNER BY TKO"" picture for the first two weeks of the show and they can have me change it as many times as they want in those two weeks. 

Be as specific as possible with your guess too.

Sound interesting? Want to talk shit to a coworker? Need a really cheap way to propose marriage that involves sports, but no jumbotron? Just want to see that picture of your friend drunk and passed out with braveheart marker-face for a fortnight on the subreddit?

Take your best guess:)

My guess is an entirely new Shiva (I so hope they keep her as a comedy vehicle) that is still a trophy but gets a complete makeover and kinda looks like the T1000 with a buncha chrome and stuff. Not so high school, more artistic, but with a picture of Shiva still on it. Possibly a small bust even in place of a picture."	t5_2sws5	True

- Rodney Ruxin, reigning champion and current owner of The Shiva.

- Andre Nowzik, one-time Shiva winner and first-ever recipient of The Sacko.

- Taco MacArthur, one-time winner of The Shiva and last year's runner-up for The Sacko.

1323332099.0	n4mb8	So, would anyone like to hear the story of how Steve Rannazzisi lost his virginity and some other interesting info? 	BenHuge	6	3	2	"M'kay. So I just got back from the storytellers show at the Improv and I wish you were all there with me. Steve was **hilarious**. (So was Russell Peters and Ari Shaffir, did you know that Ari Shaffir and Steve are REALLY good friends? Apparently as a joke one time Ari stripped down to his underwear and crawled in bed with Steve's wife, but that's another thread...)

First, found out that he is moving from the LA to NY. He's in the middle of it right now. But he is keeping his family and house that he owns here. Which tells me that he is shooting a new show that seems to have been picked up already or something. Can anyone else think of why he would buy a second place in NY and live there a good chunk of time, but the rest of his family would stay here? He didn't explain,  but anyway. Onto his v-card.

I'm going to do my best to do this story justice and remember as much as I can. I might be adding edits if things come to me later. Trust me though, it was AWESOME.

So he was 15 when he lost it. He grew up on Long Island and there was a girl he had been messing around with for awhile. He lived nearby, a few streets over if I remember. This girl was pretty attractive as he recalls, something Reynolds. We'll call her Debbie Reynolds since I can't remember.

So he and Debbie are getting pretty hot and heavy, but neither of them had gone all the way yet (there was never any talk of his pretty cock in this story) however they had done pretty much everything else. They decide to lose it together and they start to scheme a plan. (I'm telling this in the 3rd person, but try and think of Kevin telling you this story himself at a party, his mannerisms and voice are nearly identical to his character.)

One other thing I forgot to mention was Debbie was a twin. She has a twin brother that was about 6'3"" and a star athlete. Steve was on some team or had a class with him or something and it was sorta talked about that he liked his sister and she liked him back. The brother's response was, ""yeah, that's cool, just be cool."" And this conversation took place a few days before the event was to happen so Steve took that as, ""Yeah, you can date my sister"" and not ""Yeah, you can pound away at my sister like the inexperienced loser you are."" But he decided to go for it anyways.

So the plan was hatched. Directly across the street from Debbie and her twin brother, Bruce, lived a good friend of Steve's named John Sees. Steve wasn't really good friends with Bruce, but he was with John. John and Bruce were friends. So Steve had John have Bruce over to spend the night this one specific Friday. At the same time, he told his parents that he was spending the night at John's house, but he was REALLY going to stay at Debbie's. His mom dropped him off at John's and then he snuck over to Debbie's.

Now there are two parts of the story here that get important. First, Debbie was the kind of kid that was allowed by the parents to just flop anywhere and sleep. If she happened to fall asleep on a couch downstairs, no big deal. Anywhere in the house that she ended up was ok to crash on for the night whereas Steve's mom didn't care about anything, but when it was bedtime your ass had to be in your fucking bed just so she could open the door and peek in on you to make sure you weren't dead.

The second was that Debbie's dad was a paraplegic and was confined to the second floor of the house. Well, not confined. More like he lived his life mostly up there and had one of those crazy chairs like the one that short-circuited in Gremlins (or was it Weird Science?) that takes old people up and down stairs and if he started to head down to the ground level there would be at least 5 minutes of warning because of the chair so all clothing could be replaced and body parts separated.

So Steve sneaks over, Paraplegic Dad is sequestered upstairs, Bruce is spending the night across the street and Debbie is sitting on the couch. Steve joins her and they are sitting there watching a movie. A few minutes go by and they are both pretty much like, what are we watching TV for? And they start to go at it. They're hooking up for a little bit, clothes start to come off, pretty soon they are naked and Steve is in position.

He radios the tower and instead of getting a ""Negative Ghostrider"" he gets the green light! He slides it in and everything is going rather well. She turned out to be one of the girls that didn't bleed or feel much pain so it was actually enjoyable somewhat for both.

Steve is just pumping away, really going to town like an eager 15 year old should, when he hears a noise. It's not the noise of the electric chair on the stairs. It's the sound of the sliding glass door in the other room opening. And in comes 6'3"", huge, athletic Bruce. Crying his eyes out like a little girl.

Steve hears this, sees him, and thinks ok, fuck. He just saw my white bare ass pumping away in his twin sister and it brought him to tears.

ACTUALLY, John had called him a fag and he came home to cry about it to his sister.

Within seconds Bruce sees what is happening and starts screaming and yelling bloody murder. Paraplegic Dad upstairs is rousted and starts making his way down to the first floor.

## Chaos. 

Steve is grabbing his pants and trying to put them on. Brother is yelling and crying. Paraplegic Dad is yelling from upstairs and trying to come down. Steve says he is going to leave. Bruce yells and says no, that he is leaving and storms out.

Debbie calms Paraplegic Dad down by telling him that Bruce was just upset and he has already left. He goes back to bed.

So, now, it's just the two of them again. All has calmed down. They are sitting there thinking of what they should do. Should Steve leave? Should he stay?

Well, they decide that they did all this planning and there is no reason to stop now. So they go at it again. And start doing the naughty dance.

### SEVEN FUCKING TIMES!!!!

Steve lost his virginity, and that night, he had sex with the girl SEVEN TIMES. Amazing.

Immediately after the seventh time every cell in his body is just SPENT of all energy and he instantly falls into a DEEP DEEP sleep.

Suddenly, the next thing he knows, he is being awoken by Debbie, next to him on the couch, crying her fucking eyes out.

She said all he wanted from her was sex. He tried to explain that they just fucked seven times and it can really take it out of a guy. She was having none of it.

She broke up with him right there. He picked up his pants. Put them on, and walked out the front door...



...buuuut that's not quite the end. It's now 1 AM and he has nowhere to sleep. He can't go to John's. Bruce is there. He can't go home. He's supposed to be at John's. His (ex)girlfriend just kicked him out of the place he was supposed to sleep and he's 15, with no car and no money.

So, from 1 AM until 8 AM the next morning, he slept in the woods behind Debbie's house.

He then proceeded to run to John's driveway RIGHT at 8 so he could hop in his mom's car before Bruce came out yelling about what the hell was going on.

The End.

I'm pretty sure it was Gremlins."	t5_2sws5	True

Now that I've actually properly caught up, I have to admit.. season 4 was so good. I mean, reaally good. It's genuinely made me a proper fan of this show to the point I wanna follow it and properly keep up.. like seriously. Season 4 was funny as fuck. I loved it.

It took me until recently to realise this was actually on FX which doesn't really surprise me now considering FX has the best shows these days. Legit being another of their comedies that I really enjoy.

Maybe we could have a ""The League and Kevin"" Reddit Meetup?

I go to every one of these shows. Ari Shaffir is HILARIOUS. They have a poster for every show that is drawn by Kevin Christy and signed by all of the comedians and then it is randomly drawn at the end of the show and one of the people there goes home with it. So this one would be signed by Steve! The other comedians on the line-up are funny as hell, plus there is supposed to be a special guest for this show that they had to agree to not put on the bill, but Ari Shaffir agreed to give everyone there handies if they were unsatisfied with the show. I have the email to prove it.
