1334920946.0	sjhes	Everything a beginner needs to know about cannabis. Self-post, too, so please upvote.	econymous	164	22	38	"Disclaimer: Dammit, Jim! I'm a stoner, not a doctor! Some of these may not be 100% true for all people and some facts may have been omitted. I'll fix them as they're brought to my attention. Also, **please look up applicable laws in your state to determine if cannabis is right for you.** 

Basically, cannabis comes in three flavors. Sativa, Indica, and a third one that's useless called... Rudimentia or something similar. No one smokes that third one. It's not used for hemp or what-have-you either, given that it's the smallest of the three. 

Now, Sativa is not similar to salvia at all, although it is an easy thing to confuse. 

Sativa (as was mentioned before) gives you more of a head-high. This can be both good and bad. 

Upsides

* More energetic (not crazy hyper like coke or anything, just awake)

* Much more of a ""free-your-mind"" type of high. You'll have all kinds of weird thoughts you wouldn't otherwise have.

Downsides

* PARANOIA. This is everyone's problem with sativa. When I said freeing your mind, what I meant was... it kind of kicks you out of your habits of thinking. Normally your brain tells you ""no, that's ridiculous, don't waste your time thinking about that"" but with a decent head high you don't think like that. This means that every cloud will look very cool, you'll have crazy insightful thoughts, and every time you take a step you will imagine a cop or a thug is right behind you. You should note that not everyone gets paranoid, most people aren't affected like this at all. I am, though, and most people that say they don't like pot are affected in the same way.

Fun facts

* It grows much taller, up to 25 feet in height. As such, it's typically grown in large outdoor groweries. Were it legalized, this is what would be grown in Cali due to their excellent growing conditions (google the Green Triangle to see what I'm talking about).

* Additionally, if cannabis were legalized to grow for non-recreational/medicinal purposes, such as hemp, this is what they would use because a taller plant can produce much more hemp using much less ground space.

Then there's Cannabis Indica, the body-high

Upsides

* Much more similar to being drunk.

* No paranoia or bad feelings at all.

* Very relaxed high; you'll lay back, say ""oh man, I am sooooo stoned"" as opposed to sativa where you'll lay back and say ""oh shit man, I don't even think time is real""

Downsides:

* You can get too tired. This isn't a ""fall asleep where you're standing"" thing, but more of a ""I'm real stoned, I'm gonna lay down"" and then wake up 2 hours later, completely sober.

* The body high can kind of mess with your depth perception and make you dizzy. Someone mentioned in a different thread the feeling of falling backwards every time you sit down. This can happen, but it's avoidable by just not leaning/laying back. Sitting up straight works just fine, as well as standing. In **extreme** cases (as in, ""this happened to a friend of a friend once"") the dizziness can lead to nausea and vomiting. Again, I've never seen this.

Fun facts: Indica grows much smaller, bushier, and has much wider leaves than sativa. As such, it's grown indoors much more than sativa. However, the shorter/bushier look does not suit well for production of anything other than, well, recreational/medicinal buds. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE: It hits everyone differently. The above descriptions of the effects are as general as I could make them. **

Methods of ingestion (Ranked from most to least economical in terms of amount of weed required to get you high)

**LESS IMPORTANT NOTE:** For most of these you are going to have to grind your weed up in to small pieces. It's pretty easy, if you don't have a grinder I typically just crush it with my hands while it's still in the plastic bag. You need fairly small pieces. Fill the bowl right up with those, push 'em down a bit and you're set. Except for hookahs. Smoking pot out of a hookah requires at least a little experience so I won't go in to it here.

* Edibles. The basic tradeoff with edibles is that you can get much, much higher than smoking or arguably vaporisation, but to make a batch of brownies or what-have-you, you need a fairly large amount of weed. Baked goods like this work because THC is released through heat (HEAT not carbonization, this is important). THC will also bind with alcohol and fat, which makes ""weed tea"" a possibility. NOTE: weed tea does NOT involve pouring fat nugs into a mug of hot water and stirring. Google some recipes. One of the favored methods of ingestion via edible is called ""cannabutter"" which as it sounds is butter infused with cannabis. Tastes delicious, you can store in your fridge or spread it on anything. Oh, one more downside to edibles: They take a fairly long time to make and they smell VERY strongly while you do so.

* Vaporizers: Expensive pieces, but definitely worth it. They are the best method of ingestion you can buy. There are a few ways to vaporize the THC in weed. As I mentioned before, it is released via heat only, not by flame.  The main methods are the hookah and the vaporizer. A vaporizer, or vape, is definitely the more popular, at least here on the weed-related subreddits. Specifically, most members will point you towards a portable vaporizer called the Magic Flight Launch Box, or MFLB. I don't own one and have never seen one, but I've only ever heard good things about it online. So I won't vouch for them but you should look them up if you've got the money. Anyways, vaporizers are one of the healthiest ways to smoke, although many people say that it will affect the high. Not in a bad way, necessarily, but definitely a different high. This may be due to the lack of smoke not causing a shortness of breath+head high. I'm not too sure. Anyways, vaporizers work by heating up the weed, usually using electricity or indirect flame from a lighter. NOTE: indirect flame from a lighter makes it look like you're smoking meth. Use an electric vape as they're much better with temperature + heat distribution. 

* Hookahs: Huge range of expenses. Mine was $140 and has served me very well. I've seen smaller ones go for $20, and on eBay you can buy artistic ones that range up to thousands of dollars. Hookahs are one of the only pieces that are actually meant to be ""tobacco only"", at least according to modern day hookah enthusiasts. They were invented in afghanistan and were probably one of the first ways to enjoy pot, in the form of hashish. Nowadays, most hookah ENThusiasts will tell you to smoke shisha (a delicious mixture of tobacco, honey, and various flavorings) out of a hookah and never soil it with drugs. This may be the way to go if you have a really nice, expensive, classy hookah, but if you have a cheapo $20 one you should be fine. Hookahs also utilize vaporization, but in a slightly different method. It's hard not to look classy as all fuck while smoking a hookah. Basically, at the top of this long stem, there is a bowl. Inside the bowl sits the shisha or weed. There are small holes in the bottom (enough to pull vapor thru but not your smokeable). On top of the bowl goes a screen, or, if you're cheap, a piece of tin foil with holes poked in it. To be honest, I've tried both and they work equally well. On top of the tin foil is a coal. The heat from the coal will get hot enough to vaporize the weed or shisha without burning it. You inhale through a hose. (picture the caterpillar from alice in wonderland, he smoked a hookah). The hose connects to the base which is full of water. Important: The hose ends inside the base, but a you're not inhaling any water. The water simply cools the vapor down and perhaps filters out some of the nastiness inherent with coals. The stem to which the bowl is attached goes down below the water line. So, you inhale through your hose, this pulls air down over the coal (which heats said air up), the hot air passes over the shisha or cannabis (which is already pretty hot from the coal being right on top of it) and pulls down the THC, or tobacco+flavoring. This goes down the stem, into the water, then out of the water, through your house, and into your body. Hookahs are my favorite way to smoke, due to the absolutely delicious flavoring of the shisha. There are (legal) hookah bars in most US cities where you can go and smoke high-quality shisha out of high-quality hookahs. Since shisha is just tobacco you need to be 18 to enter but other than that they are 100% legal. I highly advise you check one of these out. They do **not** allow marijuana in there, as this would be *very* illegal and they'd get pretty fucked.

1320161608.0	lwhzo	Since I've started smoking:	sladoid	160	16	19	"I picked up a part time weekend job ontop of my full time job and have been working on average 70 hrs a week. I've been doing P90x before Every smoking session my friends generally joing me since I'll smoke them out before we do P90x. I'm literally getting a six pack and am getting in the best shape of my life, my self esteem is through the roof, my friends are also seeing dramatic results. I make enough money and finally balanced my budget and payed off all my debt with my part time job money. Now that my debts are payed I buy just about anything I want and drive my honda civic that gets 37mpg and is a stick shift! (my first car which I also payed for with my extra cash I've been saving up from working so much)

I've met the greatest people in my life and have a much better and healthier social life now. I don't have a girlfriend yet, but I figure with the body I'm building I'll have no problem finding a decent chick who is also healthy smokes and takes care of herself. I have an amazing set of friends who I always smoke out at my house since I have the extra weed money from my part time job, they love to come over and workout and smoke with me! We jam to the greatest tunes and have the grandest adventures together, I couldn't ask for better friends, I'm so appreciative.

Smoking gives me dry mouth so I bought a 1L Sigg bottle. I have gotten into the habit of drinking 3 liters of water a day, which makes me feel amazing.

When I smoke I get bad munchies. So I stopped buying junk food and have only fresh fruits, vegetables, beans and whole grains. I'm almost a vegitarian I just dont keep meat and junk food in the house. I can have it if I go out, just no junk food at home. By far one of the greatest things that's happened to me. I eat to make My body happy, I no longer eat to make ME happy.. 


I have become less selfish and more appreciative, I buy what I need and use the hell out of it. I no longer buy nick nack random crap that is literally just 'stuff' to make me happy. I have removed all the 'stuff' in my life and literally have what I need and a few things that I like to have but don't need (nice gaming computer, new cell phone, tv etc) I'm simple and run efficiently.


I have pretty bad ADHD that doesn't allow me to focus on anything in school really. I'm not going to brag, but I'm smart enough to catch on and pass without having to study really, but I make B's. I can really focus now and do my work, something I've never been able to do without literally forcing myself to be encaged in the library at the last minute so I dont fail. I'm out of school this semester saving up money and getting out of debt.

I occasionally smoke with my sister and we watch great movies and play mario party and just have a great time actually getting to know my sister. Something I've never stopped to do anymore.


I feel like our normal life is this structured mess where we build and build and build, sketching out on a canvas, intentionally applying specific strokes to get the main painting. But it's the blurry weekends, the times you find it hard to recall everything because you were just living life. Those blurry moments are the brush strokes that brings everything together and creates your masterpiece. 

For me a smoking session is when I stop walking down the busy street
and stare. Just soaking in life and all it has to offer, sometimes the ideas are good sometimes they are bad, sometimes they make me happy sometimes they make me sad. It's all life. ""To each his own"" ""Such is life"" I understand those words now. Actually I dont understand the words, thats folly, I understand the emotions those words are meant for. 

/r/trees, and /r/saplings.. You're the greatest thing that has every happened to me.. Before you guys I was as average as an average man comes. Now. I'm going to be something exceptional! Make a Man of myself! It feels good :) I can honestly say I'm happy with my life and what I've finally made of myself. I could get in a car wreck right now and die and just be another unknown statistic to the world. But I'll know. I'll know I was a beautiful and fruitful plant. And you guys *cheers* it was great for what it was and is :) ""Love and peace!"" -Vash The Stampede

"	Brinjal	132	19	12	"*This is a small guide aimed primarily at first-time smokers and those who have had weird, unpleasant or unmemorable experiences with weed so far. Regular 
users probably intuitively understand what I'm talking about, but hopefully putting it in to words is interesting and helpful to you.  Most of the advice 
that potential smokers receive concerns proper inhalation technique, comparisons of different methods of ingestion, and activities and snacks to try during 
the high. I will talk about the actual sensation of being high and what you can do increase your enjoyment of the experience.*


Ask a regular smoker, ""*Why do you enjoy being high?*"" and you'll receive many answers. But when it comes down to it, it's difficult to express. Everything 
seems richer and rawer. Some people describe a child-like sense of wonder. You derive even more pleasure from doing the things you love. It's almost as if 
you perceive the world in higher resolution. 


*Life in HD.*


Here's what weed is to me:


A **Magnifying Glass for Awareness**.


A magnifying glass allows you to see something in very great detail. It reveals what you would otherwise overlook or be unable to perceive. It allows you to 
focus on one subject, to the exclusion of everything else in your visual field. Weed does the *same* thing to your awareness. It lets you to focus on something with your whole attention. 


To extend the magnifying glass metaphor, 
if you were to pass an anthill while walking, you would probably glance at it and continue on.
Maybe you would watch the amorphous, black mass coalesce around its tiny pyramid for a few moments before moving on.
But, if you stopped and crouched over the hill and pulled out your magnifying glass, the black mass would dissolve into individual ants going about their day.
You would see one ant bringing a crumb five times its size back home. Or 100 ants fighting, overwhelming and evenutally dismantling a doomed
grasshopper. After watching for a time, the patterns and behaviours of these ants slowly become apparent. You may start to notice alien reflections of human society in the miniscule civilization 
you are hunched over. Waste disposal, resource collection, social stratification and class, cooperation, territoriality, war, sex and the daily grind and on and on. All of this is exhibited by tiny insects 
experiencing the world by blindly probing in front of themselves with their antenna.

*The staggering complexity, beauty and subtlety was there to see the whole time, but it took a magnifying glass and some focus to appreciate it.*


Let me give you a more concrete example. You are eating a bowl of spaghetti while watching television and talking to your friend. Meanwhile your mind is 
running its own narrative, intermittently distracted by the itch in your foot and your body telling you to switch to a more comfortable position. your 
attention is constantly pulled to and fro by the many competing inner and outer signals of everyday life.


Now you are *high*; viewing life through a *magnifying glass*. The *hot* spaghetti, slightly al dante and slick with tomato sauce, *warms* and lights up your 
mouth. A whisper of basil follows a *spicy* garlic note. Saltiness, sweetness and acidity play together on your *tongue*, each affecting the other in a complex 
relationship. You move the magnifying glass. Troy and Abed are building a pillow fort. You remember *childhood* memories of building forts with your 
siblings. This recollection is interrupted by the soundtrack of a commercial whose *melody* entrances you. your *friend* gets the punchline of a joke a few seconds after it's 
delivered and starts laughing. You *laugh* as well and together your laughter builds its own infectious momentum. Your subjective experience continues like this 
for the duration of your high, as you peak it becomes more powerful and as you come down it becomes more subtle.


Once again,


weed is a **Magnifying glass for Awareness**.


Whatever you point your mind at is revealed in greater depth and detail. Allowing you to derive greater enjoyment and meaning from it. It can be a physical 
sensation like touch or taste. It can be sight or sound. Perhaps you are focusing on an emotion, memory or idea. Whatever it is, it is amplified.


*How can you apply this magnifying glass concept?* Here are some


**SIMPLE GUIDELINES** *for first-timers (these are not rules. As you become more comfortable with being high or want to push your limits, you can break these 
guidelines):*


* **1) Don't multi-task**


Looking at several different things through a magnifying glass is difficult. You have to keep switching back and forth between subjects. When you're high, 
try doing one thing at a time, you will be pulled into the experience and enjoy it more. After you are done, move your awareness to the next thing. If you 
are doing several things at once, you may become overwhelmed and confused. This confusion can become an enjoyable odyssey or a bad trip. 


Sometimes it's better to do what you're doing alone or quietly. Social interaction can become another ""task"" that overwhelms you, especially for SAPs.


* **2) Start simple, get complex**


Some things demand more mental resources than others. Eating a burger requires less thought than cooking that burger. You have to form and grill the patty, 
slice tomatoes and lettuce and Caramelize Onions. One requires you to divide your attention between multiple actions while juggling several thoughts and 
timings. Simple activities or thoughts will allow you to focus your attention rather than those which involve many sub-components. 


Social interaction is also more complex than we give it credit for. You must take in a complex array of information involving body language, words, ideas and 
cultural practices, reflect on it and transmit your own signals back. That being said, interaction with fellow human beings can be extremely rewarding while 
high.


* **3) Be aware of (mind)set and setting**


People usually advise this when talking about more powerful psychedelic drugs like LSD or Magic mushrooms, but it is a helpful concept to keep in mind when 
using weed. 


Your current mindset and setting will affect how well you can control your awareness and where it wanders. If you are stressed out, then you will probably 
turn your attention there and amplify those feelings. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Weed can help you work through difficult emotions and problems 
because you are able to think more deeply about them. Plus, while high, you can forget about these problems easily by focusing your attention elsewhere. 


In the same way, your surroundings or setting will affect your attention. A sunlit field, with headphones on in the middle of nowhere will present different 
paths for your awareness to travel than a crowded party with friends and strangers. Each of these trips will have a different ""flavour."" Be aware of this. 
Preparation really helps in this area. Know when and where you want to be. Smoke when you know you will be in the mental space you're looking for. Prepare 
your meals and activities so that you're not focused on getting everything together during your high. Of course, disorganized and unprepared highs have their 
own flavour, too. You can have some great adventures.


* **4) Learn to control your awareness**


The bottom line is that you should learn to direct your attention. you should be able to move from one area of intense, telescopic attention to another when 
you want. Or focus deeply on one thing for a period of time. If something is bothering you, learn to turn away from it. If something attracts you, let it 
consume your focus.
 

**COMMON PROBLEMS** *experienced by first timers:*


*""Am I high?""*


*""Nothing's happening. I feel the same.""*


*""Things feel different but normal, too.""*


*""I'm freaking out!""*


If you find yourself dwelling on whether you are high or not, it's because you're understandbly dwelling on your nervousness at trying something new and 
possibly dangerous. Your expectations and anxiety are foremost in your mind. Guide your attention elswhere. Forget about having smoked and enjoy the music 
that's playing or take a bite of that chocolate bar and enjoy the taste. If you like dancing, move around and explore your bodily sensations. Maybe you 
really enjoy nature. Take a hike.


Things that involve consuming, spectating or absorbing are passive and therefore less complex than more active things like creating, doing, or participating. 
Focusing on the physical and tangible is generally easier than focusing inwardly on thoughts and emotions. These are not hard rules and there is a lot of 
overlap of course.


If you feel as if you are freaking out then you may be experiencing sensory overload. Refer to the above guidelines. It's also possible that you are 
confronting some issues that you weren't even aware of when sober. Now is a good time to seek solitude or comfortable company and ride it out or work it out."	t5_2rukl	True

1314039846.0	jquug	Another reminder from the moderators - Under no circumstances will an attempt to procure trees via Reddit be tolerated		117	11	13	"On a daily basis there is at least one post where someone is ""asking how they can obtain trees in his/her area."" Although these posts are well-intentioned and come out of desperation, they quickly degenerate in to a quick internet hookup.  
  
I want to take this opportunity to remind people that the internet is not as safe, secure, and anonymous as it may seem, and Reddit, with it's millions of users from all around the world, is absolutely no exception. You do not know who you are talking to, and what intentions they have.  
  
The reasons these posts aren't allowed isn't just so we can play big brother. Most of you are adults and can fend for yourselves, and it is not our place to tell you what's right and wrong, safe and unsafe. The main reason we do not encourage this, is because it simply attracts negative attention. Saplings is intended as a sort of safe internet haven where we can innocently learn about cannabis culture. If this Reddit (or any other for that matter) becomes an online black market and a place to get a quick hookup, it will easily attract the attention of people we do not want. Just like Facebook can be used as incriminating evidence, so too can Reddit, and I assure you, the Reddit team will *not* protect you. They are running a reputable business and will not be held liable for any illegal activities going on on their website.  
  
The bottom line is that it is simply not safe. We want absolutely none of it on Saplings, and most Reddits feel the same way.  
  
For those of you who are genuinely curious in learning *how* to obtain trees in your area, there are many simpler and safer ways.  
1) Find local stoner hangouts in your city. Parks, bridges, schools, what have you. Stoners are all around you, you just have to look for them, and ask.  
2) Order a pizza and ask the delivery guy.  
3) Ask friends, or friends of friends. Go outside your direct social circle if none of your friends have direct access. Somebody you know through 6 degrees of separation smokes weed.  
  
We need your cooperation in keeping Saplings a safe community. Do *not* give out personal information. Do *not* try to obtain trees via the internet.  
  
Thank you for your support."	t5_2rukl	True

**First, a quick message to our too high friends:**

1. Keep reminding yourself that you are simply high and it will pass. Being ""too high"" can't hurt you, there's no need to worry.
1. Get as comfortable as you can, be it sitting or lying down.
1. If you're with friends, talk (calmly, no rowdiness) about a subject you like.
1. If you're by yourself, listen to some chill music. Grateful Dead or Simon and Garfunkel are choices I'd recommend. Alternatively, you can watch Regular Show or Adventure Time (fantastic to watch while high). Or whatever other shows you like. Futurama is also a good one (notice the pattern here of bright, colorful cartoons?).
1. Keep hydrated. Water, teas or juices are preferable. Sodas tend to make cottonmouth worse.

1351491744.0	129hyi	I'll be here in 4 years.		133	34	43	"Hey guys, I'm a freshman in high school who was been offered to toke countless times. I am fascinated with weed and I have thought countless times that it would be great to try, but the potential effect on brain development has deterred me from it... for now. 

I really want to focus on my work (In a slump already) and excel at school, that way in 4 years I'll look back and know that I did the right thing. Just remember that I'll be back in 4 years, I'll tell you all about my first time.

EDIT: Hey guys, I've got a quick update. I was out with a few friends on Halloween night, one of them asked me if I wanted to try weed for the first time, he told me there was no pressure and that I didn't have to do anything I didn't want to, so I said no. It was kind of weird, I had a bit of hesitation when I said no, I kind of wanted to do it, just to try once with some good friends... The motivation to succeed is great, but does anyone have any advice on saying no without hesitation.

1326391346.0	oe64b	Some Advice on Not Getting Busted from an Experienced Ent: May you learn these lessons easier than I did.	DisregardMyPants	101	11	24	"I see a lot of questions here related to getting busted, figured I'd drop some knowledge. Some people consider me paranoid about this stuff, but I got busted once and I don't plan to replicate it. I'm sure a lot with disagree with me on this shit, but whatever.

Oh yeah: This is written from the perspective of someone who grew up in a non-medicinal state. The stakes(and what you should do) are different if you're in Cali.

**Not Getting Busted in the First Place**

* **Never break 2 laws at a time**. Or as it was put to me: ""*You never get arrested for having weed in your trunk, you get arrested for having weed in your trunk and your taillight out*""

* **Do not store your weed in the same place you store your driver's license, insurance or registration**. Nothing makes a speeding ticket worse than a marijuana charge on top of it.

* **If you have weed on you, be nice to cops** - Yes sir, no sir. How's your day been sir? Keep your hands on the steering wheel if you're in a car, ask permission before you dig anything out of the car.

* **If you get pulled over, they look for movements from the driver's seat** - Don't turn around, don't throw, don't make any movements that would be clear from your silhouette. Also be aware that they're probably going to do a quick glance behind/under the drivers seat without making you get out of the car. This means dropping it next to/under the seat can be a bad idea. 

* **If you're going to smoke in public, don't use glass.** Use a joint or carry a small piece of tinfoil you can use to ghetto rig a can. The point is you want to be able to eat or quickly toss anything you have. Joints or a 1 hitter are best.

* **If you live in a medicinal state and travel out of state, be on your best behavior.** If you get caught they will likely make you drug test in your home state. If it's legal 90% of the time for you, it's worth being a bit extra cautious that other 10%.

* **Cars are stupid places to smoke. Parked cars are even more stupid.** If you're driving:Cops and citizens are a lot less sympathetic when they think you are endangering others. If you're parked: Your lighter might as well be a road flare at night.

* If you live by water, **use a boat**. Most cops don't give nearly enough fucks to come out and find you, and you're surrounded by a place you can safely toss it.

* **No matter how used to it you get, remember it's illegal** - It's not a big deal for our generation, but many older people still see it as bad. Don't get lazy.

**When The Police Show Up and Know You're Carrying**

* If you're running, be aware that doing so will likely significantly increase your charges and will eliminate any chance they will go easy on you if they catch you. Also be aware that people do get away. Examine your situation carefully. If you're 1 of a hundred people at a party, you may pull it off. 1 of 5 in a parking lot? Just keep your ass still, you're done.

* **Do not consent to a search** - They will find it if you do. They're good at their job. There is a much lower chance they'll be able to get a dog to search your car.

* **Do not ever fucking carry bags or scales on you outside your home** - It's a one way ticket to ""intent to distribute"".

* **One cop is better than 2 cops** - If the cop is going to cut you slack, it's helpful if he doesn't have a partner around. If you're fortunate enough to get a single cop(which doesn't happen often), it's *probably* in your best interests to not give him a reason to call for his partner. I've actually seen a cop help a kid toss beer cans out of his car 'before his hard ass partner showed up'.

* If you have to toss your weed, **toss it somewhere you can't get it back**. Seriously, $60 worth of weed will be the least of your financial problems if they find it. Throwing it in a ditch won't work, they actually look for it.

* **Keep in mind that throwing it is a calculated risk**: They need *something* to search your person(in theory), but the minute that weed leaves your body it's free game.


* **Don't be a dick**, especially if the writings on the wall. You're not going to convince the cop that weed should be legal in a 30 second exchange of words.

**Fuck, you're busted. What next?**

* **If you're under 18, don't freak out.** Your state probably has a way of getting you out with a clean record. In Michigan(for example) there's the 7411 and the ""Youth Training Act""

* **Lawyer up** - There's a plethora of possibilities(like the ones mentioned above) that you don't even know how to ask for. You will get destroyed if you don't do this.

* **Clean your Facebook up** - Limit what will show up in the news feed about you (random inebriated tagging has been the downfall of more than one ent), remove any pictures of you doing anything you shouldn't be at the age you are. Don't add any facebook friends you don't know.

* **Start Saving Money** - Probation is damn expensive. Think ~$80/m just to be on it, plus $5-10 per breathalyzer(frequently required with Marijuana cases), $10-15 per drug test, random court costs.

* **Shut the fuck up to the police**, but don't be arrogant about it. They're going to want to know who the dealer is. If you have a small quantity, they will probably not go significantly easier on you for giving this information up.

* **Going to Court? Get a hair cut, where a damn suit** - Presentation is everything. You need to portray the idea that you have something going for you that they would be screwing up by coming down hard on you.

* **Once there is paperwork done or radio traffic about the incident, you're getting charged.**. Most cops are not going to let you go once either of those things happen.

* **Places drug test differently.** ""Monthly"" tests don't all happen the same way. Some places it means everyday you have a 1 in 30 chance. Some places it means you get tested once a month. Obey the conditions of your probation, but if you're going to break them know what you're getting into.

* **""Diluted"" drug tests generally just mean ' your piss is clear'** - Vitamin B will clear that up. Red bulls have a huge percentage of Vitamin B and will turn your otherwise water filled piss yellowish green in no time. Diluted drug tests are seen by many probation officers to be just as bad as dirty.

* **There is a difference between a lab drug test and a home drug test** - Home tests(which are also used by many drug testing programs) barely work at all. 2-10 days if you're skinny[don't test your luck]. Lab tests can go up to 30 days.

* **Violating Probation is serious business** - They will not be nice to you. They think they *have* to be harsh to send a message you're not getting. Don't give them this chance.

* **If you're in a ""serious business court"" (especially if you're a minor) get your ass to outpatient rehab** - They're going to probably put you there anyways, and it shows the judge you're serious. If you do it ahead of time, you get to pick your own program and they won't want to remove you from it. You can find one you find tolerable.

1332261377.0	r599h	Rivid's Guide To Finding A Dealer	rividz	95	14	20	"By rule of thumb it is usually crass and distasteful to ask strangers online to hook you up with a contact (obligatory nice try DEA). Unfortunately due to the illegal state of marijuana, giving personal information over the internet in connection to purchasing marijuana is a good way to catch unwanted attention from police and internet weirdoes. In order to solve these problems, I thought it would be imperative to make a guide for finding a new dealer. Most of this information comes from my personal experiences, constructive criticism to this ""guide"" is welcome!  

The number one problem with a lot of these threads being made is that the poster is being socially awkward. Neither myself, nor Reddit can help you with this. This guide is more or less about how to make *friends* with people who smoke pot. Ideally you want a “dealer” that will become a good friend, not because he’s got the hook-up, or just because smoking is the only thing you two have in common, but because you’re both chill ents. 90% of the “dealers” you will encounter just want to smoke for free and buy enough to part out to close friends. Someone who is dealing with harder drugs, or pills, is a gang-banger, or doesn’t like you for whatever reason has WAY MORE excuses to rip you off at some point. **Grow some balls, and go outside.** 

Here are some tips:

- You should ALWAYS start looking for a new dealer before your stash runs out. Otherwise you’re gonna be in a Wendy’s parking lot at 9pm waiting for a friend of a friend to come through. George Carlin was right on when he said that when two guys are sitting alone somewhere in a parked car, you can be sure drugs are involved. 

- Once again, think ahead. Network even when you have bud.

- [Cops **can** legally lie to you,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAzYs00pxgE) ~~but they won’t smoke bud with you~~ (see next paragraph). An informant will, but as long as you're not a big time dealer you should be fine. Someone will be a lot more willing to hook you up once you toke with them (if you’re paranoid, make sure they inhale). The laws regarding police conduct may be different where you live compared to where I live, I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. If you are paranoid about a police encounter check [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqMjMPlXzdA) out, or get a copy of one of Barry Cooper's DVDs. 

I might be wrong in saying that undercover police cannot use drugs. [Opn420 linked to a page on Erowid which cites 21 U.S.C. § 885(d) of the U.S. Code](http://www.erowid.org/freedom/police/police_info6.shtml) as saying ""Police officers working undercover have exceptions from certain criminal laws. For instance, law enforcement officers directly engaged in the enforcement of controlled substance laws are exempt from laws surrounding the purchase, possession, sales or use of illegal substances."" On the other hand, [here is an article by former Texas police officer Barry cooper where he states that undercover cops were NEVER allowed to partake in illegal drugs on or off the job.](http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/node/18941) 

I am sure there are three things we can all agree on concerning this: (1) the chances of being busted buying a baggie of weed are slim, (2) police officers lie, (3) once arrested there is literally nothing you can say to the police that will help your situation until you speak with your lawyer. 

- Use your fucking head! Don’t front a stranger money. Make sure you have a friend with you before wandering down any dark alleyways. If you live in a dangerous place consider only bringing enough money for whatever you’re going to buy (I tend to always do this as a general rule of thumb). 

- Put yourself in the other person’s shoes. At what point would you be ok hooking up that person in the mirror?

- Dealer etiquette varies from person to person. If you are thinking about posting a dealer etiquette thread consider just asking your dealer in person next time. That way you both know what to expect. If they’re your dealer, and you call to ask if you can visit or talk for a little bit; they will know what’s up.

- If you are going to smoke with your dealer, HE should be smoking you up for patronizing him. Although I would suggest throwing into any bowls you’re going to smoke after the first one.


There are some Internet resources you should check out. Going to Webehigh is a good first move. It might tell you where you can procure bud in your city, but it will also let you know how open or restrictive your area is concerning pot. You might want to check Norml’s website out as well and see if medical marijuana is an option that is available for you. Finally, there is Silkroad, which I would recommend as a last resort for marijuana. If you don’t get scammed, your package could be intercepted or stolen. An ounce of high grade weed is bulky, and REEKS compared to some LSD blotter. 

Although I have never tried it, I have heard that people do have success with pizza guys. (It’s the perfect stoner job after all!) As mentioned before, you should consider inviting him in for a toke first. You could even be innocuous, answer the door with an unpacked bowl and see if they notice, be creative! [Make sure to use your best judgment to safeguard yourself from assholes.](http://www.wtsp.com/news/article/213849/58/Pizza-delivery-guy-calls-cops-on-customer-who-smoked-marijuana) Something else that has brought up is working in a kitchen as a dishwasher. I guess the idea here is that if your every day routine isn't getting you what you want, you need to break out of it and find some novelty/dank nugs. 

Universities and colleges are good places too. If a nearby school has a SSDP, NORML chapter, or other drug reform group… go and hang out! DO NOT discuss trying to buy pot in their office. Go to some meetings, get to know everyone, and ask once some people step out for a cigarette or bowl. Even if your local Uni is an hour away, you should be checking these places out if you’re in high-school anyways!! Towny highschool students would hang out with us all the time and it was totally chill. There is usually a place on campus where stoners go to smoke; probably hills and fields where students chill on in the weekend. They are a cool place to relax with a book or frisbee. I should also mention that a lot of my stoner friends hang out or work in coffee shops, where it’s probably more acceptable to strike up conversations than other places (bonus points if you bring a Jack Herrer or Terrence Mckenna book with you). 

I would say it is likely that any 18 to 20 year old that smokes cigarettes is going to smoke bud. If you are a smoker too, consider approaching them for a chat. Casually bring up that you’re new in town, and if they know anyone with bud. Keep in mind that when selling someone something this is considered the cold approach, and only works for a percentage of attempts. Anyone buying cigars (blunts) or Zigzags at a gas station is probably a toker. But would you follow up with anyone you met at a gas station? 

Take a walk around the parks. They are a great place to hang out in general. Go for a walk and see if you catch a wiff of bud. Dusk or night time would work the best because young people tend to stay up late. Once again, be safe. Parties can work in your favor too. I would recommend NOT buying at the party though. Most dealers I have known cut the bags down to .8 or .7 either as a convenience charge or to take advantage of drunk people. You're better off just bullshitting with the people that are smoking.

[Demographic factors are something you want to consider when approaching someone.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique#Demographic_factors) Please note that I am **NOT** telling you to stick to your own race, or to socioeconomic class, or anything else obviously retarded. I am pointing out that age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender are things you should take into consideration. Don't hang out at a high school trying to pick up bud if you're a forty year old dude. tha_snazzle suggests asking any young white person with dreadlocks. I have had friends (both male and female) who had dreadlocks, and they were constantly jokingly asked about weed by strangers. However, I have a male German flatmate with dreadlocks, and if he does smoke, he's completely down low about it! 

My last piece of advice is avoid false positives. When I ran cross-country in high-school, everyone had long hair and wore jam band t-shirts (most of these people were anti-drug). During a summer evening where a bunch of us were going to play D&amp;D, some of us stepped outside to smoke a jay. A fellow cross country runner panicked, and literally ran away. We thought that he might of went to go get some authority figure but he came back saying he wanted to get away from ""the drugs"". He was wearing a Phish t-shirt.

1309006426.0	i8vo9	So your family just discovered your trees! What now?	TubbyandthePoo-Bah	91	10	12	"Dear Saplings,

It's come to my attention that many of you are getting caught with trees. Understandably you're upset and believe the use of trees is a personal decision, and one that you should be allowed to make for yourself. This is true to an extent, and I won't wax lyrical upon what age you should partake in trees or anything like that.

**Disclaimer: if your family are understanding, then talk to them openly and discuss the matter. Take their advice over mine. This advice only applies when you know they have no understanding of cannabis, and you know they'll go mental**

Let's start this off simply - your family loves you, and no matter how angry you feel you still love your family. This is the basic premise I'll be taking here. I understand this may not be true for all of you, and some parents, siblings, or spouses may enjoy making your life a living hell. I'm fortunate enough not to have suffered your plight, honestly I don't understand it, and I would suggest contacing a support charity relevant to your ordeal. Do it now, your life doesn't need to suck.


**The basic premise:** 

Your family disagrees with your decision for thier own reasons, and they want to protect you. This is how true love affects all of us. Nobody wants to see a loved one destroy themselves, especially if that person is your child. Without understanding this none of your family's actions will make sense.


To be able to navigate your problem in a mature and sensible manner, that won't cause friction, you need to use a very basic tool you already understand. **What someone does not know will not hurt them.** You need to be clever, strategic, and determined to this course of action for this to work.


**Understand the initial encounter:**

You got caught. Either your shit has disappeared, or you've been called for 'the talk'. If your stuff has gone, and you are 100% sure you've been caught - own the hell up. This will give the impression that you're scared, confused, and truthful. You want to be working to give this impression from now until everyone forgets about it. If you just get pulled in for 'the talk' then you've been caught off guard, and you don't have the advantage of free confession. This is how most of us find out about the impending shit storm.


You're scared of how all this is going to pan out, you're angry because you feel your rights and privacy have been breached, and you want to vehemently defend yourself. Essentially what you want is for your use of trees to be accepted. If it was an empty can of beer or something they'd probably find it cute and you'll just get a wait until your older then you can drink type of deal. This paradoxical notion is going to annoy the hell out of you.


Instead of being shocked and angry you need to empathise with what your family are feeling about your herb use. They think it's a gateway drug and next thing you'll be shooting heroin into your genitalia. They don't understand that herb is not a gateway drug. Really they could have any number of notions.


You need to understand they are terrified for your safety, and nothing makes people more protective and irrational than thinking their child is in danger. **You cannot intellectualise this or debate it, no amount of rational argument on your part is gong to assuage the sheer terror they feel right now.** If you take anything on board from this it's that these people are only intervening because they want to protect you. Let's be mature about the problem and solve it rationally.


**Strategy for 'the talk':**

Understand that you're working with irrational fear! The **only** path to a win state here is to nullify that fear. You need to think from their point of view, and give them the responses they want to hear.


They want you to understand that you're wrong, they need to see that you think weed is addictive/against god/ going to destroy humanity. Whatever it is they believe, you need to make them understand that's the belief you have also come to by partaking in trees. This is incredibly important, unless you want to be hearing about this bullshit for years. 


It's massively important that you walk out of the talk with them thoroughly believing that weed is a VERY BAD THING! That you know it, and you're now sincerely convinced by their arguments against it.


**Show penitence:**

Until they trust you they're going to keep fucking hassling you. Don't get drawn in by this shit. What's happening is they're working out their own frustrations. You need to adhere to the notion of penitence from the moment you got caught until people shut the fuck up about it.


You need to be consistent. If you make out that you think trees are good then you're just making your life difficult for yourself. You can be bitchy, backtalk, whatever, but your argument must always be that you think weed is stinking shit that corrupts youth. Ask counter questions referring to why they don't trust you. You don't always have to suck it up, but remember... drugs are bad 'mmmkay.

**Something to think about:**

Maybe trees aren't for you right now, it's said that there's a place for drugs, and it's called college. I first smoked trees at 15, occasionally smoked at 18, and became a heavy smoker at about 25. I tried every drug available to me in the two weeks after my 21st birthday, and basically didn't like them.

Take things in your own time.


**Get smart:**

Now your problems are just about over, but if you still want to enjoy trees, you want to get back toking. Now you need to be a hell of a lot smarter than you were before. This will help you endlessly in life anyway. You're not 'living a lie' or some shit, you're compartmentalising your life, being sensible, and exercising sensible levels of caution. AKA being mature.


* Rule 1 - Don't shit where you eat. Don't have a sly toke in your room like some dumb kid, who thinks they can get away with everything, because they're so much smarter than everyone else. That kind of muddy thinking is going to get your ass caught. You will fuck up in some way, eventually, and probably a hell of a lot faster than you think. Any change in your behaviour at home is going to arouse suspicion -Why are your windows always open? - Have you started using more deodorant? - Why does the closet smell of febreeze?


* Rule 2 - Don't be stupid, don't toke with idiots that have no fear of getting caught. Don't let your stupid mates get you caught, I can't stress this enough. And for fucks sake don't get caught by the police. It's not safe to toke it up in the car, walk down the street, or leave evidence of trees on some boozy campout. Don't become overcome by paranoia, but don't be that idiot that thinks they're invulnerable. That's how idiots end up in jail. If you are caught be respectful and deny all knowledge. For fucks sake don't ever talk yourself into police custody, don't chuck your weed out a car window, throw that shit down your neck and keep quiet.

* Rule 3 - If you're out in the wild don't get completely blazed, you're just asking for trouble. Find a safe smoking spot and use that. Don't leave any litter or evidence or your spot will be found. If it's your intention to get really blazed then do it in the safety of someone's home. If you're going to a party that's likely to be busted keep your herbs in a small paper bag, so you can drop them discreetly, preferably whilst walking. In the same vein never take too much weed to a party, or in a car, because you'll never know if you'll need to toss it or eat it.

* Rule 4 - Don't appear to be a stoner. Never go home fucked, your paranoia will betray you. Always carry eyedrops. Don't tell your family you're off to see your best mate that's a stoner, be non-specific, unless you're asked and then either garnish the truth or tell an outright lie. If you tell an outright lie it must be one that cannot be proved or disproved, saying you're going to X's house when you don't actually go over is dumb. Don't answer your phone stoned. Say you were driving, or better convince people you only talk via text or instant message.


* Rule 5 - Never take weed home, ever. You don't need to. Either keep a stash somewhere, or only buy small amounts - enough for you and your pals to blaze in one session. Always check your pockets for incriminating evidence before you go home. Get used to doing it.


* Rule 5a - If you MUST take weed home, hide your shit better. If it's easy for you to get to, and it's in your house or garden, then it's easy to accidentally discover. If you really want to chance it, you think you've got everyone fooled and you're going to keep your shit close, buy a lockbox. Tell everyone you're buying a lockbox to keep your savings, stamp collection, precious porn cutouts from the '70's in. Remember though, that shit is easy to break into. A lockbox is a good idea if you intend to stash stuff at a friends house, because it discourages them from toking it up when they are short.


* Rule 420 - Enjoy your herb, and enjoy your family. They are both good things. If you have to choose, then choose your family. Weed will not be there to help you when you run into serious trouble later in life. In this world the **only** people you can always trust to act in your best interests at a moment of real crisis are your family. You may think I'm wrong, but please don't try to prove it. If you end up homeless, or what the fuck ever, you'll soon learn the limits of a great friendship.

Here's how it went	bandrroid	92	16	19	"So last night my brother and I were a bit drunk and were talking about how nice it would be to get some bud. Usually we know someone, but since we are both visiting my parents for the summer (and they've moved somewhere new) we were out of connections. Fortunately I stumbled on someones advice on here to ask the pizza guy and here's how it went:


The first pizza we ordered the guy said he would see what he could do and to not be worried if we got a text from a sketchy number later  on in the night. *OP never delivered*

The second pizza guy straight up said no and left. 

When we asked the third pizza guy if he knew where we could get some smoke he was all like ''You guys mean like weed?  For sure dude!''  He smoked us out and then said he'd text us some numbers later on in the next couple of days.

- Never mention trees on the phone or in a text, or even in ""secret code""
- If texting, do not send one message per text (1.yo 2.you good? 3.mind if I stop by?) but rather - may I stop by?
- Dealers know why you are contacting them. Again, just ask if you can stop by. If he/she is good, then they will say yes. If they aren't, then you'll get a no.
- Don't share numbers with your friends without dealer approval.
- Never make your dealer meet a fresh face. Go solo.
- If you're just getting a g, its ok to grab and go.
- If you're getting 1/8th+, its advisable to stay and burn one to cut down on the dealer's traffic.
- Get what you have the cash for. Asking for a front is a scumbag move, except with close friends who really trust you.
- If you're buying headies in a state with a pricey market, don't try to haggle. Dealers with premium product, esp. on the East Coast, have razor-thin profit margins on $60 1/8th tree &amp; most of them are just selling to support their love for trees.
- If it goes dry, don't constantly pester your dealer with herb status updates. They will contact you if and when the drought ends.
- Don't take/make phone calls from your dealers house.

I'm sure there are plenty others, but those are some key ones I wanted to share, in hopes that maybe one day, all this will filter back to me.

When I got home I smelt grass. I was immediately pissed and when I opened the bag, sure enough, clumped grass. I showed my brother and he went as far as to try to smoke a joint out of it despite my warnings. Obviously, he got no where. I tried texting the guy when I first noticed it was bad and a gain earlier today telling him that it was a shame he ripped me off because I would have definitely bought more off him in the future.

Ok, so you're ready to move up from joints or pipes to bongs, the big leagues. Before you go out to your local smoke shop here's a few tips and pointers you should know. 

**Terminology**: 

*[Downstem](http://reviews.nuggetry.com/post-pics/trikky/trikky-1-5-09-illadelph-slit-style-bushing-diffused-downstem-001.JPG)*: a long, slender tube of glass that holds  the bowl of the bong.

*[Bowl](http://img492.imageshack.us/img492/782/bowl8ae.jpg)*: the small circular glass or acrylic item that holds your trees. 

*[Diffused downstem](http://www.bbsmokeshop.com/files/2009/08/glassonglass19-19mm-glass-on-glass-diffused-downstem.jpg)*: a downstem with holes or slits in the bottom intended to produce more bubbles thus a smoother hit 

*[Percolator](https://www.smoketown-headshop.de/bilder/produkte/gross/50cmBlackLeafPercolatorBong.jpg)*: the percolator is an additional diffusing mechanism made of glass 

*[Honeycomb percolator](http://cdn103.iofferphoto.com/img3/item/472/883/920/phx-hd-honey-comb-bong-4b40.jpg)*: a type of percolator that resembles a honeycomb 

*[Tree percs](http://www.thebongblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/TreePerc.jpg) superior to dome percolators, resembles a tree with several branches often with diffused types, can vary greatly in number of branches*

*[Showerhead percs](http://www.thebongblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Eross-showerhead-percolator-300x300.jpg) similar to dome percolators, but have less drag (amount of time to clear bong)*

*[Inline percs](http://www.smoketown-headshop.de/bilder/produkte/normal/40cm-Zenit-Inline-Percolator-Bong.jpg)*

*[Stemline percs](http://cdn103.iofferphoto.com/img3/item/385/137/842/sovereignty-king-stemline-20-inches-tall-brand-new-b7766.JPG) this it the cream of the crop when it comes to percolators, it creates the most bubbles out of all percolators, and more bubbles means smoother hit 

*[Ashcatcher](http://www.gorillaglass.com/images/clear%20g%20on%20g%20ashcatcher.jpg)*: a glass bowl with a basin that is filled with water to quite simply catch ash to prevent it from entering the bong 

[*Ice pinch*](http://www.rollitup.org/members/intrin-71982-albums-random-picture819654-ice-pinch-medicali-bong.jpg): a feature common on many bongs that serves to allow ice to be placed in the chamber of the bong to cool smoke 

*[Stemless](http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1353&amp;bih=739&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=Th0Kh5ybAo7bjM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://forum.grasscity.com/toking-tools/546093-syn-inverted-showerhead-stemless-bong.html&amp;docid=xZgZoxQu6IMhlM&amp;imgurl=http://img709.imageshack.us/img709/2965/img00054201002081203.jpg&amp;w=2048&amp;h=1536&amp;ei=UeFmT7XzMI6Ttwes9-nTBA&amp;zoom=1)*: many high end tubes (straight shots) do not have a downstem and simply have a integrated downstem. In other words the downstem is attached to the piece 

**Bong Materials**

*[Glass](http://cdn102.iofferphoto.com/img3/item/470/466/936/18-inch-straight-shooter-biohazard-glass-bong-5538e.jpg)*: the best material to use for a bong Highly recommended 

*[Acrylic](http://www.drbongs.co.uk/images/bassuiBong.jpg)*: often times cheap alternative to glass bong, not recommended

***It is necessary to note that not all glass are made the same. There are obviously cheap and durable glass. [Borosilicate glass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borosilicate_glass) is a very thick, durable material used on high end pieces made by Toro or Sovereignty for example. I'd suggest going boro glass over cheap, mass produced glass. In [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6aFmXKlWac) video Luke Wilson, a talented glass blower, touches upon the quality of mass produced pieces.***

**In the Smoke Shop**

-Do NOT mention cannabis in any way shape or form even in you are in a medical state

-Do NOT call them bongs, call them water pipes or pieces

-Be careful when bringing in a piece with marijuana residue. In some shops this is okay, in others this can get you in trouble. 

-Be smart. 

**How To Pick Out a Bong**

1. Determine your price range. Bongs can range from as little as $10 to thousands of dollars. It's important to determine your price range to find the best product. 

2. Straight shot, beaker or other? Now, this is mostly a matter of personal preference. Straight shots offer the least drag and fastest snap (amount of time it takes bong to clear). Beakers offer more surface area and therefore more smoke. Other types, like bubbles, are a combination of both beaker and straight shot. I suggest straight shot as it clears the fastest. 

3. Artistry, ornate designs, and decorations do not improve the quality of the piece. Many people argue this because they believe a piece should have character and I completely agree, but not at the price of quality. Too often I see saplings buying cheap, but beautiful looking pieces only to have them break very, very easily. Please be careful when purchasing an ornate piece. You can always get a unique bowl or different downstem or stickers to personalize your piece. 

4. Features. Nowadays it isn't uncommon to find a nice solid straight shooter with an ice pinch and a diffused downstem for about $60 or less. Look for bongs and head shops that know the latest technologies for pieces. Search yelp and other reviewing sites for the best head shops. Do some research. 

5. Durability. Durability is a very important factor when choosing a bong. You don't want to have it shatter if it gets a little banged up. I'd suggest a bong with a 5mm glass thickness. This is not very hard to find. You will thank me because it also gives you milkier, thicker hits. 

6. Haggle. Often times you can haggle with the head shop employees **respectfully**. Don't try and lower a price on a unique, brand name piece. They will shoot you down. Offer to purchase another item for a combined deal. Mention you frequent the shop often. Just recently I got a huge discount on a dab setup (concentrates) simply because I had bought my piece at the store. 

7. Buy a bong bag. I can't tell you how many times I've seen downstems or bowls broken in the back of a buddy's car wrapped in an old t-shirt. Get a bong bag. The headshops will often cut you a deal if you buy it with your bong. It's worth it. 

Good luck with your bong purchasing ventures. Feel free to PM me with any questions. 

**Brands** 

*Note: Name brand bongs are not the end all-be all of bongs, but many high end labels require their glass blowers to have a scientific glass blowing certification ie Illadelph and Toro. Scientific glass generally means high quality and superior construction.*

-Sovereignty

-Roor

-Toro

-Helix

-ZOB

-Vertigo

-Illadelph

-HVY

-US Tubes

Have you ever got really high? Of course you have! Have you got really, really high? So high you thought you were going to have a heart attack, or vomit, the room's spinning the moment you close your eyes and you can't quite get it to stop if you open them again?


If you've encountered all the horrible panic, and that's as high as you've ever managed to get then Tubby is here to help you get past a [7], because Tubby thinks you're worth it.


We'll do this in steps, surely other Ents have superior methods to achieve unparalleled levels of blockup, but this is how I managed to go from the nasty little panic attacks **I** get, which prevent me reaching an [8] - the level where you can feel your whole body.


**Step 1 - eliminate tobacco**

Those of you in the UK who toke spliffs mix your herbs with tobacco. Tobacco, of all varieties but organic (American Spirit etc.) contains a smorgasbord of contaminants. You can guess the reasons for things like [arsenic](http://www.tricountycessation.org/tobaccofacts/Cigarette-Ingredients.html) being in there as well as I can, but overall they are designed to increase the intake and effect of the nicotine through your lungs and to your brain. 


The additives increase the hit of the tobacco and the trees, so you get a better initial hit. However you'll find yourself at a plateau because of the chemicals, nicotine, and the wasteful nature of smoking a tobacco joint. Remember, you're burning more tobacco than ganja, and most of the mixture is being exhaled. Unless you're baking in a car or a shed or some other school kid hijinks the efficiency of the method is too low.


I'm not saying don't smoke tobacco while you're getting toasted, just don't mix it with the herbs. If you want a really nice clean high, though, then don't smoke tobacco unless you want to calm down and level out. If you think the walls are looking at you funny then it's probably time for a cigarette!


**Step 2 - increase efficiency and get really stoned**

When you've got the baccy out of your herb it's your time to shine, or radiate, or whatever the hell people do when they're really sparkled. I like to lie foetal and drool.


The easiest way to get extremely high is the American puff puff pass method, with or without additional rules. It staggers the intake of goodness, and as long as there are enough of you to keep going after people start to whitey, extreme levels of blazedness may be reached.


Eating is probably the most efficient way of getting wrecked, but there are some complexities. No matter what anyone tells you cooking with weed is not easy, especially for a stoned ENT entering a kitchen for the first time. Above a certain temperature all the goodness in your weed will burn off, this temperature is considered low in cooking terms. The reason you always see space cakes and hash brownies are because they're yummy foods that are baked at a low temperature. If you cook read up and be careful, otherwise you're just wasting trees. You gotta save the rainforest my dear!


Pipes, spoons, vapes, bongs, buckets, waterfalls, hotknifes, and other such pure burning methods are the next best thing to cooking, and it's the next best thing to one draw pass with a room of your favourite ents. Smoke it up like I know you always do. Exhale, hold it in, it doesn't really matter. All these tools get you hellastoned and are a matter of preference. 


**Step 3 - meet the panic barrier**

You need to keep getting high until the room starts spinning, until you get horribly paranoid, sick, panic attacks (palpatations, unusual feelings in your chest and arms), whatever it is that freaks you out and stops you getting past [7] - what I call the panic barrier. 


When you hit the panic barrier you're as high as you want to be at the moment, so don't force yourself to smoke more. You can't punch through the panic barrier by sheer force of will, bravado will only make it worse.


The key to this, and it sounds really simple, is that none of it is real. You aren't going to have a heart attack! All of the 'physical' symptoms are simply the shift past [7]. Cannabis can't hurt you, unless someone drops a bale of it on your head, these feelings are your brain freaking out. In my case, all these sensations were linked to my physical well being. Places built up with stress and aches. Our brain blocks out continuous sounds, it also blocks out discomfort from stiff muscles and other little aches.


When you go past [7] you start to feel your body, and it's a shock. I still freak out pretty badly as I pass [7]. Maybe that's just how it should be. I don't know.


When I hit the barrier, many times over the last 20 years, I never knew how to handle it. Eventually I decided that the symptoms weren't symptoms at all. If it was symptomatic of anything it was just that I was really fucked. So as the room spun, panic, or a thumping chest attacked me I tried to stay calm and concentrate on relaxing. The room's not spinning (although I can feel it doing so), I'm not dying (although I feel like I'm having a hear attack), nothing bad is going to happen. Relax.


**Step 4 -  relax, don't do it, when you want to go to it**

After the initial panic attack you still have to shake off the residue of doubt. Rationally you know nothing bad is going to happen, but subconsciously you're still tense. On a physical level you'll still have tense muscles, and these tense muscles are sending messages to your brain telling it they're not too happy about the situation. Up until now your brain has been ignoring the signals, but the crossover at [7] messes all this up.  Or that's my pet theory anyway. To get past this I started off with some stretches, paying particular attention to the joy of shaking off my limbs afterwards. Move about, wriggle, act as loose and daft as you can handle. Do whatever it is people do to release muscle strain, the key is to not think about it too much. Shrug off all that stress and doubt.


**Step 5 - break through [7] and keep on going**

To get up to a real [8] you need to prepare gradually. At its crux an [8] is like a shortcut to being able to meditate. By meditate I don't mean sitting half lotus 'omming', or reciting mantras - these are just teaching tools that allow one person to teach another to meditate, to relax, and empty their mind of all the crap rattling about in it. We ents just short-cut that preparation by being massively stoned.


We do however need to follow some of the principles of meditation, [we need to borrow the poses](http://www.chikung-unlimited.com/Meditation-Positions-2.html). Or Yoga, that's probably better, I wish I could do yoga...


The poses just let you relax your body properly, straightening your spine, and you don't have to look like an idiot doing it. There is a pose and posture for sitting in a chair that looks inconspicuous and relaxed. I like to lie in bed on my back, but some people find they just nod off to sleep then they do that, thus the talk of poses. The pose is important because the sacred herb can get us high enough to feel our entire body we still need to make sense and order of that wash of sensation.


**Step 6 - be your own master**

More than that I can't really say, you have to take your own path blah blah blah. Also I'm able bodied and some of my terms and descriptions may be poorly worded for my fellow ents with disabilities. Please don't take offence as I recount my experiences.


The way I did that was gradually. I'd get completely blitzed and lie flat out on my back with the room spinning. Then to stop the spinning I'd try to understand the sensation. That led me to all kinds of tense muscles. One by one I learned to relax them and internally mapped each one, always looking for oddities, what I ignorantly call missing muscles. Not actually muscles that don't exist, but ones you forgot about, don't use, can't feel, whatever. 


When I say feel I don't mean poke your fingers into yourself. Use your central nervous system. Feel and relax each muscle in turn. I normally try to relax one tense muscle, which invariably seems to be tense because of a connected muscle, often a muscle you didn't even know that you had. Eventually you'll start to feel how they're all connected, and you'll probably be a bit surprised. This is the short cut to meditation I was talking about. It's funny because it's pretty easy to do when you're [7]. Try it when you're [0]. It gave me great respect for people that can clear their mind and feel every muscle in their body simultaneously, without having so much as a bite of spacecake.


Slowly you'll start to get a better feeling and understanding of this strange quasi meditation thing and you'll be able to snap right through the panic barrier and into the calm meditative state you need to hit a good solid [8].


So that's how I learned to love the bong, and the whitey - I learned to be like the dude and abide.


Happy tokes all. Thanks for the positive vibes!

Hello all, I was arrested yesterday at school for possesing wax in the trunk of my car.

They are charging me with a felony. (Concentrated cannabis). 

I do have my medical card, and I didn't know that it was illegal. The guys at the clinic sold it to me and.did not tell me anything. This really pisses me off because im going to have a felony for this and the dispensary is selling it? How was I supposed to know that it was a felony to have it?

Edit: called a lawyer, he said he could get the charges dropped(2500$ , sucks for me im poor) 


Also called the dispensary, they denied the whole thing , they said that they dont know what im talking about and they dont sell it, and hung up. 



Edit: thanks everyone for all your help, anymore advice would be great. Let this be a warning to all ents in cali that didnt know that this is illegal and a felony, "	t5_2rukl	True

2. Eliminating the ""will I pass this test...?"" posts

Here are some easy, simple, but useful rules and tips!

1. NEVER tell a non ent, that you have weed on you

2. Do NOT smoke out of plastic (such as pens made into pipes) aluminum (such as pop can steam rollers) copper, or full brass pipes (as some may be coated or made in a poor manner), unless absolutely necessary! It's very dangerous. After awhile aluminum is ok, but only if with the correct knowledge of how to use, or with an elder who can assist!

3. Make sure when you get a stash box it isn't too suspicious. Keep something very common in your room that no one will touch, or toss on you. Here's an example http://imgur.com/a/Bqh8b

4. When smoking with people, don't be a dick, this gets you kicked out of sesh's and lose friENTS. 

5. Don't spray too much cologne, body spray, or any other deodorizer on yourself before leaving the house as this is very suspicious!!!

6. NEVER carry your stash box with you, unless going to a smoke spot/sesh! This is how people get caught, without the intentions to smoke.

7. Make sure you have cough drops, eye drops, and lighters with you at a sesh. Always carry extras.

8. Never allow other people to ""hold"" your weed, if you don't know them. I know many ENTS who have gotten their stuff stolen this way.

9. Always listen to the elder ENTS unless It seems ridiculous and you know it's not right. They are always willing to help

10. The most important one is DO NOT be afraid to ask
questions! ENTS help ENTS! Do not be shy, we want people to be educated correctly!

11. When buying your first piece, make sure it's simple, but not too simple. There are lots of confusing maze like pieces out there. Try a standard Sherlock pipe, or glass bowl.

12. When smoking alone, make sure you have the company of a phone, and maybe some music. It's never a good idea to isolate yourself from everything when smoking.

13. When with an elder, smokin or not, make sure you ask all questions that you have, because if you are in a sesh with a d-bag, he might call you out for stupid stuff.

14. Relax, and have fun!!"	t5_2rukl	True

The [top comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/lsq5s/here_is_the_response_we_have_been_waiting_for/c2vcet2?context=3) in the discussion thread was one I agreed with so much, I created [a new petition in reply calling for petitions to actually be taken seriously](http://www.reddit.com/tb/ltdum).

The petition quickly amassed thousands of signatures, but as you can see, the deadline to reach 25,000 signatures, of which over 5,400 are still required, is November 27th. It's almost there, but doesn't look like it'll make it in time. So I'm asking for one final push past the finish line.

Whether you agree with its wording or not, or even feel petitions themselves are useless gestures, you must see the entertainment value of seeing them obliged to write an official response to their own responses thanks to a petition born on Reddit.

1358711383.0	16xzme	A few thoughts on bongs for all you saplings..	Fudbar	58	6	13	"I was originally going to post this as a reply, but it got a little long (like most of my posts do.. :)   ) and it's good general info, so I thought I'd just turn it into a separate self.post and share it with everyone.

**Do bongs get you higher?**

  Sort of.   I'm going to use an alcohol analogy here; bongs are like hard liquor.   Do you get 'more drunk' from hard liquor?  In a strictly technical sense, no.   How drunk you are is simply a matter of how much alcohol you consume, regardless of the form.  Beer, wine, liquor, moonshine.. they'll all get you drunk if you have enough.

  The reason I said 'sort of' is because just like a well mixed drink with a lot of alcohol in it (Long Island Iced Tea, Zombie, Paralyzer, etc..) a bong allows you to take in a large amount of cannabis in a very short period of time.   *However*, just like hard liquor, this can be risky and result in a very messy situation.  

  I like hard liquor, but I like the good stuff.   Well aged rum, bourbon, scotch, tequila.. things like that.  I enjoy the flavor and like to savor it slowly, taking little sips over a long period of time.   Does this get me drunk as hell?  No... I actually drink slower than if I was drinking beer or something else.  I could (and did in my younger stupid days) pound back shot after shot or guzzle straight from the bottle, but that's a waste of good liquor.  Sure, it hits you hard at first and knocks you on your ass, but the end of the evening usually leaves you with the room spinning and a lovely evening talking to a toilet, bucket or nearby bush.   Not fun.
 

  The same logic applies to bongs.   You *can* load up a huge bowl in a triple perc glass RooR and clear the entire thing in one massive hit and go back for more, but this just like doing tequila shots one after the other.   It hits you hard and fast because of the large amount you're taking in a short period of time, not because their is something magical about smoking out of a bong.  When it hits you all at once, you feel 'higher' and great for a bit, but unless you're careful, the evening is going to end with you passing out or being uncomfortably high and unable to do anything by lie down in a quiet spot while waiting for the chaos to stop. 

  If you want to smoke from a bong or drink hard liquor responsibly and have a better time, the  same logic applies to both.   Spend to get good quality and enjoy slowly and savor the flavor.   For bongs, this means making sure you get a good quality glass bong for nice smooth hits, but pack smaller bowls and slow down between hits.    **A bong *can* be a way to get massive amounts of THC into your system quickly, but it can also be a way to take much smoother hits that allow you to enjoy the subtle flavors and aromas of really good cannabis.**    

  Leave the massive bong rips and chugging contests to the 'bros' and fraternity kids.   Take the more mature approach, slow down and enjoy things.   With both alcohol and cannabis, the results are the same; you'll still be having an enjoyable evening while the impatient and immature folks are spending the last half of the evening passed out and not feeling very good at all. 

**TL;DR?  With bongs and booze, the approach is the same.  Take it slow and take smaller hits/sips.  You'll last longer and have a better time.**

Also, just like cannabis and booze, remember that you don't have to join in to have fun.  Sometimes it's a blast just to hang out sober and watch your buddies get silly, then be a GGG and make sure they make it home safe.   If you are drinking or smoking, don't mock the sober guy/gal.  They're your lifeline and can save your ass in any number of situations.  Respect that and everybody has fun. "	t5_2rukl	True

1365049879.0	1bn3pa	Complete Stoner Stealth Guide	PileOfTrees	58	8	9	"So I've posted this in the past, but I thought I'd share it again for those who did not see it.

First off, this guide will (hopefully) inform you on how to keep your smoking stealthy. This does *not* mean I am encouraging smoking behind parent's or roommate's backs.

1. Never brag. - This means, only talk to close friends, who don't mind, about your smoking. The more people know, the more likely you are to get caught.

2. Don't be stupid. Be patient. - If it's risky, don't smoke! This can lead to panic attacks and anxiety. Just wait till no one is awake or whatever your situation is, too smoke.

3. Don't get overcomfortable. - No matter how safe you think you are, always have a plan B.

4. Scent is a very large indicator for smoking. - Smell is very important. Here are a few ways to reduce smell.
 
 * [Sploofs](http://i.imgur.com/3hsBD.jpg) are very helpful ways to reduce the smell. All it is, is a toilet paper roll stuffed with dryer sheets. 
 
 * [The Smoke Buddy](http://www.amazon.com/Smoke-Buddy-Personal-Filter-Purifier/dp/B00478UIB2) is also a helpful alternative, and it probably works better.
 
 * [Incense](http://i.imgur.com/ZsNWT.jpg) are also *very* helpful for masking the scent. Just introduce your room/home to them so they can become common, then light one after a smoke sesh. It personally mellows me out, and covers the smell.
 
 * The ""[Bathroom Method](http://i.imgur.com/ZxaDe.jpg)"" is one of the most flawless ways to smoke. Start up a nice, steamy shower, and let the room steam up. If you have a window, open it, and if not, it isn't a big deal. Put a wet towel under the door of the bathroom, closing off the escape route for smoke. Blow your hits into a sploof preferably, which is also better if you aim it at the air vent or window. 
 
 * Vaporizers are VERY useful, as they leave almost no smell. You could make your own [lightbulb vaporizer.](http://i.imgur.com/Mzgwv.jpg) The [Magic-Flight Launch Box](http://magic-flight.com/) (MFLB) is also a good option.

 * Spraying with FeBreeze, Lysol, Cologne, or using something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Ona-ON10061-Pro-Gel-Quart/dp/B002JLGMEG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337743546&amp;sr=8-1) will be very helpful for masking the smell.

 * To keep the smoke in a room, a wet towel placed against the bottom of the door is helpful. This blocks all smoke from going out that way.

 * Even with a sploof, if you are using a bowl or pipe, the bowl can ""cherry"", or continue to smoke. I always hav ea water bottle cap nearby, to put on my bowl to stop the smoke. A coin also works with this.

5. Smoking outside is good. - When you can, and when it is safe, smoking outside is nice. It doesn't leave a smell, and you can enjoy the outdoors. 

6. Closets are good spots, too. - Closets keep most of the smell inside, and not lingering around your room/house. Just be sure to air it out good afterwords.

7. Fans are life-savers. - Fans are one of the most effective ways of removing the smell. Open a window, and aim the fan out it, and it will pull most-all of the smell.

8. Windows should be open. - Windows are the only way for the smoke to escape your room, so always have it open when toking! Be careful, if a breeze is blowing in from outside, this may just blow smoke further into your home.

9. One of the most important things is eye drops. They cost less than $4 at your local store (Walmart, Kroger, etc.) and usually work. Make sure only to use them when you need them, as your eyes can become ""addicted"" to them, which isn't fun.

These are all my tips for toking stealthily, so I hope this helps you all!

EDIT: I'll add user suggestions here:

* Don't let that towel stick out too far, or else it'll look funny from the outside!

* Wash yo' smelly hands. The smell sticks to your hands.

* Wash yo' smelly mouth. Gum or mouthwash works well.

* Make a super safe sploof by poking holes in the bottom of a water bottle and stuffing it full of scented dryer sheets. I've heard stories from people who used TP rolls and it didn't work out so well...

* Microwaving popcorn is a great way to make an overpowering smell to cover up other ones

* Cover your bowl with your thumb, or a coin, when you're done hitting and it is still burning. This stops smoke from escaping.

* [Hogwash](http://www.amazon.com/Hog-Wash-Organic-Hogwash-1oz/dp/B0036QOV4Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365093137&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=hogwash+1+oz) is a good spray to help remove the smell of weed.

* Roast some coffee. The smell will help mask it, and, well, coffee!

* People swear by [Ozium](http://www.amazon.com/OZIUM-SANITIZER-OZM-1-ORIGINAL-SCENT/dp/B000CSWCAG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365093079&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ozium). It is said to remove almost all smell, but I have not used it. I have also heard it is full of lots of chemicals, while Hogwash does not."	t5_2rukl	True

Y'all really make enjoying weed safe and easy for noobs. That being said, I've decided that it's not for me. I've smoked three to four times a week for the last few weeks with a mflb, and joints, so I feel like I gave it a good old college try, but I just can't enjoy it long term.

I apparently have an extremely low tolerance for THC. Half a J gets me to a [5] or [6]. [10] for me was finishing a full mflb trench. My eyes were rolling back in my head while I was trying to watch John Dies at the End, and I generally couldn't concentrate on anything. I slept for 11 hours after that, and still woke up feeling generally sick, groggy, and hazy. It was okay, but I don't really want to repeat it. Even at lower highs, I get twitchy (every couple seconds, some of my muscles tense up, and release). I get couch locked, and I have a hard time talking to people. Basically, I get all of the symptoms of [serotonin toxicity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome), but I don't think that's actually what happens to me. I guess THC just does me differently than most other people.

Anyway, I really love the cannabis community, and everyone here. Thanks for the help getting started. I learned a lot about myself on the journey, and overall, it was worth it.

It was like I was seeing the world waaay back through several frames of reference, like putting a webcam in front of the screen it's displaying on. I took in the world. I didn't see, hear, smell, and taste it; I experienced it *directly*, and could comprehend it at such a high level that I wondered how my brain could even handle it. Everything worked together harmoniously, like a well-oiled machine. The universe was perfect in every way, and I was part of it. I felt perfect peace knowing that I was living out my purpose.

If you're too high to be riding in a car, pretend like you're driving.	thehellisavcard	53	3	4	I've experienced this firsthand one too many times, and it's a terrible feeling. You're in the back of a car with someone whose driving skills you don't fully trust (especially when you're baked like a coconut cake), they've got the windows open in the front, and you're getting sensorially molested by the world whipping furiously past you and the wind blasting you in the face. To top it off, you've still got some shred of self respect and dread the idea of asking your friends to pull over so you can catch your breath for fear of looking like the guy/gal who can't handle their trees. So what do you do? First things first: establish your equilibrium. Which way is forward? How far ahead can you see? Which way is behind you? You're doing great. Don't let the left and right of you scare you. You're fighting the inertia. Your world is now in motion, and you must move with it. Stick your right foot out like it's on the gas. Rest your hand on your knee like you've got an easy grip on the wheel and just pretend like you're the one controlling the car. Your brain needs to be working on something other than freaking out.

1. Lay down the law and stick to your guns. That first joint you rolled of yours is nice but /r/trees is the place for that. If people post things like that just give them a warning and remove the post.

2. Update the sticky list. I see a questions about if firecrackers smell every other day is seems like.

3. Recruit active mods. Take a week to study the active users of the subreddit. If you see there active see if they are interested in mod. We only need a few considering how this subreddit only gets 5 new posts a day.

1352496596.0	12xm8y	Cannabis Research for effective and less harmful use - summarized in plain english for saplings	Fudbar	50	5	17	"Howdy saplings..  When doing some Googling on another topic the other day, I came across a very interesting and informative scientific paper that contained a lot of research data that I hadn't seen or come across before.  I shared it with OldHippie, and he was as interested as I was, so I thought I'd take the time to write out some of the more interesting points in a 'plain english' form.  

 Scientific papers are the best source for info, but they can be hard to read if you don't have the proper background. (In my case, I don't actually have any science degrees, but I've known many Ents with high level degrees, dated a PhD chemist for 5 years, my brother is a brilliant geneticist doing post doc work, and his partner has a Masters in molecular biology.. I've learned to read and interpret scientific papers just to keep up with dinner conversations..:)  



A note for Ents and saplings that can read this sort of stuff:  This is a layman's translation of a scientific paper.  I'm sure I've made a few errors and it's certainly not properly cited, etc...  please read the paper linked to below on your own and submit replies with any corrections.  I'll be happy to edit the post to reflect them.
 
A note for Ents and saplings that may disagree with things contained within:  Sorry, but it's science.  If I've mis-characterized anything reported in the paper, that's on me, but the rest is in peer reviewed black and white.  

If you can't be bothered to read and understand the original source material and want to argue anecdotally (ie, 'you're wrong because me and my buddies do 'x' all the time) then I'll probably just delete your reply unless it contains a good point.   Don't hate on science.   

Conspiracy theories and 'Big Pharma' rants are also not welcome.

The paper:[Harm Reduction Associated with Inhalation and Oral Administration of Cannabis and THC - Franco Grotenhermen](http://www.cannabis-med.org/data/pdf/2001-03-04-8.pdf)

My summary: *my interpretations and conclusions are in italic*, all the rest is direct from the paper and in more or less the same order it appears within.

- Inhaling any sort of smoke is bad for your lungs.

- Use materials with a high THC content allows you to reduce the total amount smoked.

- Edibles are safest and provide longer lasting effects, but it's easier to take too much.  

- When smoking, THC concentrations peak with 5 minutes of smoking.  Effects are felt within 1-2 minutes, peak after 30 minutes, and last 2-3 hours.  Certain effects last longer.   Muscle/body effects can last more than 12 hours.

- When inhaled normally, only about 20% of the THC in marijuana is absorbed in mainstream smoke. If you were to somehow inhale an entire joint in one huge toke, this number would be 69%.  About 30% is lost simply by burning the material. The rest is lost in sidestream smoke.  Bio-availability (your bodies ability to absorb THC) can be as low as 10% in new users.  Highest level reported among experienced users was 56%.

- Absorption is slow and erratic with edibles.  Effects start between 30 and 90 minutes in, usually peaking after 2 hours.  More than one peak can occur. Effects last 5-9 hours or longer with very high doses.


- Absorption of edibles in the stomach is a complex thing.  Preparations with high oil or fat content are likely to be more effective.

- Decarboxylation through heating is required to activate THC into a usable form in the body.   5 minutes at 210 degrees Celsius (410 degrees Fahrenheit) is optimal for complete decarboxylation without oxidation to cannabinol. Note that this assumes you're consuming that product without any additional heat. (ie: cannacaps)  *If you'll be baking your cannabis afterwards, this will probably need to be reduced.*

- For medicinal use for MS or glaucoma, muscle spasms the longer lasting effects of edibles are best, but the chance of taking too much is greater.

- For migraines or pain relief, inhalation provides quick relief and easy titration (the ability to control the dosage) the downside is potential lung damage

- Cannabis smoke contains over 200 combustion compounds, many of which are known to be toxic to lung and stomach/intestinal tissue.

- Tobacco smoke and cannabis smoke are fairly similar.   Several PAH's are 25-75% higher in cannabis tar, and the lack of filters and typically longer inhalation time for cannabis amplifies their absorption by 4X. 

- Holding your breath 4X longer results in a 40% increase in tars.  It's not clear if this means 4 times the damage, but if so, 4X is probably the upper limit. (1/2 joint equals damage of 2 cigarettes)

- Chronic smokers tend to develop chronic bronchitis and eventually COPD, but findings regarding marijuana smokers are unclear and conflicting.  One study found no association between heavy cannabis use and a decrease in lung function over a 15 year period.  Another found that over 6 years, previous cannabis users had some decrease in lung function, but current users didn't.  *Very strange and an area that needs more research badly.*  

- Holding in smoke may increase THC absorption, but if you gag or cough with a closed mouth, you run the risk of a spontaneous lung collapse.

- Average THC concentration is USA cannabis was 4.2% in 1997.  and 10-20% in 2001.   Higher is better for smokers since they use less and decrease the overall volume of smoke inhaled.

- One puff from a 10% THC joint provides about 5mg of THC.  Daily doses of between 2.5 and 20mg have proven effective in treating nausea and vomiting in HIV/AIDS patients. With tolerance, this may need to be increased to 1/4 of a joint (.8 grams @ 10% THC levels)  Recreational effects begin to kick in around 10mg for most people.  *You don't need to get high when smoking for medicinal purposes.  A puff or two may work just fine.*


Best practices:

- Use highest the THC level possible

- Use a pipe.  Tars condense on the sidewalls, not your lungs.  Clean them often.

- Bongs are worse than joints for cutting down tars.

- Avoid moldy, contaminated or cut cannabis.   Baking suspected moldy pot at 150c for 5 minutes kills most spores without reducing THC.

- Of all smoking methods, vaping reduces tars best (10:1 ratio to cannabinoids) followed by joints (13:1) and bongs (27:1)  *Yep, bongs are twice as bad for filtering out tars than joints*.  You can put a filter in a joint to reduce tar, but it will also reduce cannabinoids, so it's not worth it. 

- Vaporizers studied heated up to 185c without producing any toxic components.  Toxic stuff begins to show up at around 200c.  Combustion happens at 230c.  THC is available at temps as low as 140c.

- Holding your breath beyond 10 seconds does nothing but increase tar concentrations.  Plasma concentration doubles between 0 and 10 seconds.   *Around 5-7 is probably the sweet spot. Holding in is more effective for more potent pot than for schwag or ditchweed.*

- 'Cough to get off' is a bad idea that can lead to spontaneous lung collapse


- For those who have taken too much, lying down with your legs elevated will help with 'greenouts'.   Talking someone down can work.  Valium has been reported as being effective, but this should only be done by a doctor or medical professional.  *Giving someone who's freaking out *more* drugs if you're not a medical professional is a really stupid idea.* 

- For medical patients who can't smoke or even keep down edibles (stomach cancer, HIV/AIDS nausea, etc..)  It is possible to take cannabis via suppository.  Reported method was ground cannabis baked with cocoa butter for 1 hour and allowed to cool down then formed into suppository.  Effects felt within 10 minutes.   Sublingual (under tongue) and trans-dermal (through skin) absorption are also possible, but the preparation of the compounds is beyond most consumers and only possible in labs or pharmacies.  *Sublingual dosing through tincture is probably achievable at home, but your mouth is gonna burn like hell.*

1344289451.0	xsdoi	A bit of advice for the saplings.	Stolichanya	46	3	13	"The other night, I went to my sapling friEnt's apartment. Him and some of his buddies have only been smoking since the beginning of the summer so they really don't know a lot of the lingo or even how to prepare a bowl. I understand that each Ent has their own little ritual. But I came to the conclusion while watching them that I needed to guide them on how to not be wasteful.

One of them bought 2.5 grams for only $30 while we were there. Which under any circumstance is awesome! But, they didn't understand that the dealer knew he had shit trees so he just wanted to get rid of it. None of them know the difference between good and bad trees. But only to make matters worse, he said ""Hey, dude, I'm gonna make a gram bowl. You down?"" Of course I'm always down! But his idea of a ""gram"" bowl is to literally put the nugs in the bowl without breaking/grinding them up first. I wanted to tell them right then and there that what he was doing was extremely wasteful and not the way to do it. But, since it's his weed I only made little hints on it. Didn't want to insult him or anything. 

When he loaded the next bowl, however, he said ""ALRIGHT WHO WANTS SOME FUCKING STEMS?!"" and everyone else besides me said ""FUCK YEAH DOOOOD"" or any other variant on that. This is what threw me over.

So, here are two *very* basic things that every sapling should remember:

* First, **GRIND OR BREAK APART THE NUGS BEFORE SMOKING THEM.** The reason why you should do this is because:
* A) Grinding will conserve more weed. If you just stick the nug in the bowl and light it, you're *very* likely to have an uneven burn which means that when you think you've cashed it, there could still be plenty of green in the middle of the nug left.
* B) Grinding makes it much easier to corner hit. If you don't know what a corner hit is, it's where you light the very edge of the green in a bowl. That way the bowl lasts longer, you waste less, and you don't instantly torch it.
* C) KEEEEEEIIIIIFFFFF!!! Grinders are great because a lot of them have keif catchers. Which also means that you get more bang for your buck!


* Also, **NEVER SMOKE THE STEMS.** Smoking stems is somewhat debatable. But personally, I will never smoke stems again for two reasons:
* A) There's little to no THC in the stems. If you happen to get a good strain with very crystally stems, grind them, catch the keif, make a keif bowl.
* B) For me, and a lot of people, smoking stems gives me a headache. Yeah, if it has THC in it it'll get you high. But it's not a good high, and ultimately, not worth it.

So that's my two cents. I hope this helps!

tl;dr don't smoke stems and always grind.

I got home about 5:30PM, had my tea, and my friend came around to my house.
He asked me if I was coming out to chill, and to get some bud. Now, I don't really smoke too often, but this past weekend I smoke some both Saturday &amp; Sunday and has a pretty fun weekend.

So, we went to some place just to pick up £10 worth of weed. It was at a car garage (Some of the people that work there/hang around got some pretty good weed). Whilst we were waiting, a friend of my Brother's came looking for the guy I was chilling with, because my friend owed him some money. He said he had some 'chronic' shit back at his place, so we left and went to his house.

He's pretty cool, and was telling us stories of his fights and stuff he'd been getting himself into.

When we got to his house, he gave me a nice bag of bud, smelled pretty nice, I can't remember what he said he weighed the bag at, but it was alright.

We decided to chill at his house for a while, and in the kitchen we rolled a nice joint. We went out front and lit up, after a few tokes I was pretty high, and after I passed the joint I knew I was stoned as shit. After a few minutes, I was higher than I've been for quite some time, I could feel it all over my body.

I could feel myself going white as a sheet, and my whole body was tingling like ice, I thought I was going to puke so bad. It was like I could feel everything inside me, if that makes sense.

We went back inside and the guy knew I was was pretty bad. I could feel myself sweating a lot. I took my coat of my he told me to sit down. He got me a nice drink, and I sat chilling watching whatever was on TV. Wasn't sure what it was, but Football came of later. He also gave me a bun, that his girlfriend made, and it has the nicest icing I've ever had on it!.

As I was sat down, the guy went upstairs and got his tarantula out, he brought it downstairs and as he was walking across the living room he dropped it, and it landed on it's legs and it started bleeding or whatever they do.
I just couldn't contain myself and was laughing pretty hard. He was saying loads of stuff, about how he is going to have to put it down. And he can't take a tarantula to the vets.

Can't really remember what happened but my brother was on his way to chill aswell. I think my friend was in the Kitchen rolling another joint, and after a while we went back outside after I was feeling a little better.

The guy unlocked his car, and I sat down inside, with my drink. We smoked the joint and my brother arrived. As we were outside, there was a women and some children looking for a rabbit. We stopped smoking until they left. 

I ended up going back inside on the couch high as fuck. Loads of other fun stuff happened and he told some pretty cool stories. After I while, we had to leave for some reason, really can't remember why.

My borther and friend were going somewhere, and I wanted to go home, to we split the weed we had left and I went home.

I got home, and thought my Mother would have been in bed, but I was in the kitchen, just as she came downstairs. I got quite scared, as I was still high as fuck, and probably stunk of weed, since I'd just been smoking, had some in my pocket, and my hands were covered in tiny bits of bud (from splitting the weed, it was ground). So I quickly grabbed some food and went outside. For about 2 minutes, until I just took my coat of and went upstairs.

 Chilled, ate food, and spoke to some friends. 
I'm still pretty buzzed right now, but I had fun, I doubt man people read the whole thing, but it took me time. :)"	t5_2rukl	True

I'm 30 years old, and until this summer I was a judgy-non smoker.  I gave my husband crap about it when he occasionally smoked while out with friends, etc.  I was kind of a bitch about it, to be honest.  I want to share with you how I came to eat my words about this topic and have become and enthusiastic sapling.

Long story short, I have lupus and have been increasingly sick since the beginning of the year.  In June, I was sicker than I've ever been, considering having to leave my job because of it, and friggin miserable. I was told I was going to have to start low-dose chemotherapy, and I would be on it indefinitely.  I was in soo much pain and so super sick that I had trouble walking and couldn't sleep. 

At my husband's urging, I talked to my doc about medical marijuana.  He said that considering what was going on, he would be supportive of it. I smoked up for the first time a week after I started chemo (taken once a week in pill form), and have done so every chemo day since then.  It seriously was the only time I was not in pain, not stressed, not nauseous, and could finally sleep more than 3 hours at time.  

I just finished the chemo, but am still fairly sick.  While I definitely enjoy the medical aspect of it, it's been a great stress reliever as well.   I have also gotten to interesting places in my meditation, and am now at the point where I just enjoy it. 
  
And funny enough, my husband and I have really bonded over it.   He's been awesome walking me through learning how to smoke, how to figure out what to buy, introducing me to the Ents subreddit and all that jazz. 
 
Don't mind my rambling - i'm at a [6].

I'm a relatively new re-ent (gave up smoking for a couple years due to jobs and shit) and had never really smoked kief before and he shared with me the best way to smoke kief with a bunch of people. First, take a little weed and put it in the bottom. From there top with kief and then apply another layer of weed to the top. This helps it burn smoothly. I also use this even when smoking kief by myself. Lets you get two or three BIG hits of kief or a handful of small.

**FIRST SMOKE**

We agreed to meet at his place at 7:30 and I would buy pizza instead of pitching cash for bud. Not long after arriving, we smoked in his garage using a one-hitter. I took a couple of hits off of it, and headed upstairs to wait for pizza to arrive.

After about 5-10 minutes, I felt noticeably relaxed and buzzed, a lot like a couple of drinks without the loopiness. We played some video games, which I managed ok with some coordination issues. Pizza showed up and we chowed down.

In all truth, I don't really remember too much of the first smoke. Based on [this chart](http://cdn.hailmaryjane.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/1273558257127.jpg), I'd estimate that I was probably around a [2]-[3]. (I don't think I inhaled deeply enough the first smoke. You'll see why in a second.)

**SECOND SMOKE**

At 9pm, he asked if I wanted to go back down for a second round, to which I agreed. This time, the one hitter was packed, then dipped in the kief from the grinder. The first try wasn't packed right. The second one was spot on and I got a good hit or two in.

We migrated back upstairs to the couch and sat there talking. As I was sitting there, I noticed I started to feel really relaxed. I become only vaguely aware of this heavy warmness spreading slowly from the top of my head down to my neck and ultimately through my body. Everything was almost exactly like that state between sleep and wake (that is, the hypnagogic state). My thoughts were fleeting at best and I it became everything I could do to explain something or form cohesive thoughts. Time was dilated to an unreal degree. Seconds felt like minutes or longer. Minutes felt like hours. But everything also seemed to move quickly sometimes, like it was catching up with itself. ""It's like slow time and fast time at the same time"", as I eloquently explained. I found myself holding a bottle of cold water to my lips, sipping away the whole time, just being lost in the amazing feeling of the cool water going down.

My friend was grinning at me like an idiot, saying, ""This is awesome"" and said that we needed to play video games because I was ""really high and needed to come down"". A round of Portal 2 and Modern Warfare 2 proved impossible. I was seeing a village where there was only one house and was getting so lost just going from one room to the next. My own head felt super heavy on my shoulders.

I realized I had to take a leak and got up to go to the bathroom. I stumble to the bathroom and after what feels like forever, am able to finally start taking a leak. Halfway through, I forget why I was there. I realized I'm peeing and finished, washed up, and left. It felt like I was in there forever! I'm told I was only there for 2 minutes.

He brings popcorn in for snacks. I barely notice and am fading in and out of this feeling that feels like my body is awake while my mind is drifting in and out of sleep with all the hypnagogic imagery. I remember he told me to eat some popcorn. I leaned forward, forgot why I leaned forward, reached for popcorn, forgot about that, reached in to grab popcorn, forgot I'd done that too, then brought it towards myself, forgot that, wondered why the fuck I'm holding popcorn, then ate it anyways.

I left for home (with the wife driving) at around 11:30pm and was just starting to come down a bit. The car ride was a bit intense and I eventually made it home. A nice, restful sleep was not long after.

**CONCLUSION**

Today has been pretty good, save that I've been feeling pretty spacey for the first few hours of the day and generally fatigued with a persistent headache.

In all, a great experience, I think. Plus, with chronic pain in both knees from injuries suffered in the military, it was really nice to be able to relax and not be in pain.

(Btw, how high does /r/saplings think I was on the second smoke? How do you guys judge how baked you are?)

**TL;DR**

Smoked for the first time. Never thought I would. First smoke with a one-hitter left me feeling nicely buzzed and relaxed, around [2]-[3]. After an hour and a half, went back for a second smoke. Got blitzed out of my mind. Good experience overall, would do again."	t5_2rukl	True

1353536075.0	13l84c	Stealth Smoking for Young Ents (x-post from r/trees)	Philosophicaltree	49	8	8	"Hey guys, I’ll preface this by saying that I have not smoked in over a year. This advice was given to me by one of my seasoned stealth smoker friends when I told him I would like to get back into it, but I didn’t want to get caught by my parents. He gave me permission to post his advice on r/trees and r/saplings. Basically this serves as a guide to any young adult or teenager who lives with parents who disapprove of trees. I know it’s a wall of text, so you can pick and choose what you want to read!

1) Where/how do I hide my weed and paraphernalia? -Smell proof containers for both. I keep my stuff in a large tin can - I put it in a baggie, put charcoal in the can (to absorb odor), then wipe a stick of deodorant down a long piece of toilet paper, which I wad up and put in the can as well. -I keep my stuff in my closet, but don't use any single hiding place for too long. It's also a good idea to keep your herb and your receptacle for herb enjoyment separate - my rationale is, if your piece is discovered, you can act shocked that they uncovered that antique from your junior-year reefer smokin' days.

2) How get them to not suspect anything? -At the end of the day, your first weapon against being found out is not letting your parents have reason to worry. If you maintain your health, your grades, and are respectful and help around the house, then it probably won't matter if they even do suspect anything, because you'll be showing them that you're in control of it, and it's not impacting your life in a negative way. Gradually, it'll become less and less a matter of solely keeping it a secret, but also setting up a means of defense and rationale in the event that they become suspicious, or even find you out.

3) Should I use joints, a pipe, a bong, or a vaporizer? -NO JOINTS. Joints and blunts both constantly burn, making stealth-toking that much more difficult to hide. The smell will permeate any area, even when you're outside. Plus, it's more wasteful. -Pipes and vaporizers are a lot better for stealth smoking - they're smaller, easier to handle, and they conserve a LOT more herb. Whereas with j's or blunts, you need a good about of herb to even utilize the paper, with pipes or vapes, you can just stick any small amount in there and toke away. -Sociability shouldn't be any problem. I've never heard anyone complain that they're about to smoke a bowl. Really, no one cares. Your buddies will understand, and if they're the kind of tight-ass that ""only smokes mad bong ripz,"" then they can bring their own, damn it.

4) I used to use a sploof, but I found it to be a hassle. Is it really worth it? -Sploofs are never more hassle than they're worth - because they can be worth a LOT. We're talking you can smoke pretty much anywhere without being caught - but you have to do the sploof right. We'll cover this really quickly: -Take a plastic water bottle and poke many holes in the bottom with a thumbtack or other small, sharp object. -Add a layer of wet wipes (about 5 or so.) -Sprinkle in a layer of baking soda. This will absorb the odor. use a sheet of paper to funnel it in... or a funnel. -Add another layer of 5-10 wet wipes. -Crush up a piece of charcoal into a coarse powder, and then funnel that in. Again, it’s a fantastic odor absorber. -Add another layer of wet wipes/paper towels. -This will be your best fucking friend. It takes five minutes to make, but it can be the difference between secrecy and a hell of an awkward explanation for why your room smells of herb. My sploof is my best friend. Use it.

5) How do I smoke at home undetected? -If you want to smoke in your room, close the door, and stick a towel under it. Have windows? Good, open them all - but be sure to open the top AND the bottom panes. This will allow for easier air flow - warm air goes out, cold air comes in. -Get a fan. Point it towards the TOP opening of a window. When actually smoking, put it up closer to the window, pointing outside, and exhale from the sploof into the back of the fan. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A SPLOOF, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TOKE IN YOUR ROOM. I'm serious. And it had better be my super-sploof design. -When smoking, after you've taken your finger off the carb, cover the bowl with your hand or a handy coin nearby. This will prevent smoke from escaping out the bowl - and also conserve your herb! If it keeps burning, close off the bowl, the carb, and the mouthpiece with your mouth/fingers. No oxygen = no fire = no smoke. -Have some air freshener handy. DO NOT OVERDO IT. I say three sprays of one second each. Spray the entry point of the room, the space that your supplies were occupying, and then where you exhaled. You can also hit some of the corners of your room with small little sprays where the odor likes to hide. -Next, AIRFLOW. Air is a beautiful thing. Take the towel out from under your door and feel under the space. Does it feel as though cold air is flowing INTO your room from the hallway? Use a lighter to make sure. Crack your door open and hold up the lighter. If it's pointed into your room, then you have NEGATIVE PRESSURE, which is a neat little tool you can use to prevent the smell from leaking. If flows OUT, then close the door and stick the towel back under there. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_room_pressure -Now, room smoking requires the most secrecy maintenance. You can skip a lot of the work by simply going outside. In any case, make sure either a) no one's home, or b) they're asleep, or at the very least upstairs and NOT coming back down. -Garages are good places for stealth toking at night, but make sure you at least use a sploof, open the garage door just a little bit, and then exhale towards the TOP opening. Once again, use the airflow to your advantage, and understand when it can work against you! If it's a cold night, and only the bottom opening is exposed, then the air is flowing in - and if you exhale towards THAT, then you'll end up with a face full of... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVIvA5Exs28 blowback. Yich. POST-SMOKING -Clean yourself! Wash your hands and your face, and hell, your neck. Drink water, then either brush your teeth or chew some gum. Brushing your teeth is the best method, this way you can actually eliminate the stuff causing the smell rather than just covering it up. -BUT WAIT! If you're desperate, and you're sure that your family won't barge in on you, then there ARE some excellent ways of smoking undetected that don't require your housemates being miles away, physically or consciously. The best? The SHOWER TOKE. Turn on your shower, HOT HOT water, and build up steam. Then, toke as usual, USING YOUR SPLOOF, and exhale INTO the stream of water. The steam will neutralize the smoke particles and clear up the odor. If you have a window, that's even better! Open that shit up and let the steam flow on through. A couple sprays of air freshener never hurt either. Make sure you have your storage containers there in advance, though, so you can pop your herb and your piece in there to sit while you enjoy your shower - while lifted! This is also good, 'cause then you'll be clean as a whistle and smell-free.

6) And now the most important question: Is it worth it? (The risk of getting caught) Well, getting high is fun, AND can be spiritually and physically healthy, but remember: The better you get at stealth smoking, the more easily and frequently you'll be able to do it. Take care to not let it become a problem. My suggestion? Buy small. Going just a gram at a time is a good basis for organizing your smoking routine. Whether you're only buying on a friday and smoking through the weekend, or managing that gram to last you through the week, either way, you're not smoking a whole lot, and it's easier to keep it in check. However, if you're smoking socially, you'll have to buy more on account of smoking more frequently, with more sets of lungs, and more herb per smoke session. But there's another aspect to it - trust. I don't know your parents, or how close you are to them, and how important their trust is to you. I know for myself that as fun as having a secret life is (trust me, it's kind of a badass moment when you finish stealth toking without a hitch. It's good to feel prepared,) it still kind of sucks to have to, well, keep it a secret. You will encounter situations where you need to either lie or fess up, and that's not a fun thing to do. Be certain that if you go that length to keep it a secret that you KNOW that this is not a habit you need to kick. If you're confident that you are toking in a safe, responsible, healthy way, then the facade is something that isn't too morally draining to maintain.

Edit: From texts he's sent me:
From Texts:
“If you have pets, smoke around them, but do NOT try to get them high (unethical.) This has multiple benefits: 1) If your pet smells or shed, congrats! You have a masking smell... and a patsy to throw under the bus if anyone mentions a smell. 2) If you have dogs, get them used to the smell. They won’t act all interested if they detect it on ya. Also, my dogs now appreciate herb-smell with me being in a playful, happy mood...which brings me to 3) Play with them when you’re high. So much fun.”

“Use pieces of charcoal to absorb odor. Baking soda also works wonders. Eye drops are a great investment, but you really don’t need to spend more than $5. Act a little high even when you’re not high. Get your family used to the idea of you acting slightly silly or lazy. MAKE EYE CONTACT. Be considerate. Have a story, and make sure it works. Have open, friendly body language, but don’t overdo it. You’re trying to minimize suspicion—not invite it. CLEAN THINGS. It’s fun AND rewarding.”

“Lastly for now: Remember that you are putting some responsibility on yourself to keep your space clean. Do your part as a member of the household, and defy the stoner stereotype! Learn to use herb to make productivity more fun that passivity. Do work around the house! Done with that? Make art! Read a book! Explore the depths of your mind! Empathize with  people as you spend time with them! Some final pointers for if you are caught: If you know the jig is up, then don’t waste time lying.  That’ll only get you into bigger trouble and make your parents trust you less. However, assess the situation and determine how much your parents probably know to be true. Just because you’re getting in trouble doesn’t mean you can’t do some damage control. Half-truths are better than whole lies. Use your productivity. Be mature, reasonable, and non-confrontational.”"	t5_2rukl	True
1350069713.0	11doo0	Great Balls of Ganja Goo! -- The very first Old Hippie edible adventure story, lost for 15 years	OldHippie	49	14	9	"Dear friends and fellow Ents, 

I am very happy to be able to bring you this adventure, which has been lost in my archives for well over a decade. It happened exactly 15 years ago today, to the *minute* (I’ve timed this to publish exactly at 12:15…you will soon see why). 

I was excited to be at the 30th anniversary of the fabled 1967 Summer Of Love, right in San Francisco where it all happened, but I had no idea what I was in for. It turned out to be my first experience with edibles and my first glimpse at the elusive level [11]. Bear in mind that I had thought at that point that all my drug use was way in the past, and I certainly had no inkling of my future self as Old Hippie.

I wrote most of this up the same night it happened (except the last paragraph), and posted it on my blog/website (yes, some of us really had them even back in those days), but it was password-protected to keep it out of the prying eyes of search engines (they had those too!). So only my closest friends — less than a dozen people — have ever read this before today.

After I started writing as Old Hippie, I remembered this story as one of the best things I had ever written, and a classic example of someone writing under the influence of cannabis. But I couldn’t find it anywhere, although I knew I had saved it. Finally, I discovered it in a ZIPped archive that I had made last century, and knew I had to share it with you. Today.

Notes:

* My sons were 3 and 8 at the time.
* I’ve left everything exactly as it was in the 1997 original, other than fixing broken links and removing/changing names and such, except the original psychedelic background, which made it very hard to read. However, [I have preserved that background here for posterity](http://askoldhippie.com/).
* I know you’ll want the recipe. I haven’t tried it yet, but [this is the closest I can find](http://www.hempire.co.uk/showthread.php/45797-Ganja-Goo-Balls-anyone-know-the-recipe?p=815917&amp;viewfull=1#post815917) to what I remember from the ingredients used.
* My biggest surprise was that the Summer Of Love website is still up and running and looking great!

Nugs and hugs forever,
Old Hippie

P.S. Dedicated to D.T. and all good daddies everywhere.

1337807868.0	u1n0i	Don't like my high I got yesterday.	ThatRandomThrowaway	43	4	27	"Yesterday I smoked for about the 5th time. The last couple times I smoked, I could take 5+ hits before feeling the effects, but this time I only took 2 hits total. A small one to start and a big one 2nd. I'll explain the high with bullet points in the order that the effects occured

Bullet points are in order.

1. Strong happy feeling. I wish it stayed at this phase, because it's really realxing.

2. Everything moves slower. This part is very fun. I turn my head and everything drags a little behind what I'm looking at.

3. Random thoughts. I like this part because it's hilarious. I make myself laugh and laugh. This lasts throughout the rest of the high.

4. Body starts to vibrate. I close my eyes and lay down but I see shapes and lines forming into things. It freaks me the fuck out.

5. Body is shaking. Full body vibrations occurring about every 10 seconds. About every 30 seconds it feels like I'm sober for about 5 seconds, then a HUGE wave of vibrations come. They start at my head and make their way down to my toes. I'm fucking scared shitless and can't move, stand or do anything. It felt like I would close my eyes and never wake up. I  keep telling myself that nobody has ever died from weed, but I still couldn't remain calm because I honestly thought I was dying.

6. I laid in bed for about 2 hours motionless before I fell asleep.


How high was I? I didn't really like it because I was fucking scared the whole time through phase 5, which felt like an eternity.

Is this what happends when you personally get high?

How can I reduce the effects? I only took 2 hits, so how could I possibly smoke less? Smaller hits?

The first 4 times were awesome, because I felt amazing and got random thoughts. I never got full body-locking vibrations.

Is weed just not for me? I loved it all the times before this one.

1315229401.0	k5bd6	I'm a 25 year old guy who's tree-curious. Questions inside!		41	3	31	"A quick blurb about myself: Generally cheerful 25-year-old Australian (Brisbane QLD) guy. I've never had alcohol or tobacco (my mother has had far too much of both and the shit I endured during childhood has scared me away from both), but I've had little exposure to marijuana.

Here are my questions: 

+ What do you use weed *for*? (I know you smoke it to get high, but do you use it to relax, to explicitly hallucinate, as a social thing like alcohol, etc?)
+ Can you bypass the anti- and pro-weed propaganda and tell me if it has any negative health effects (both short- and long-term?)
+ Is it safe to try it for the first time by myself, or should I do it in a group?
+ For the Australians in the audience, what are the legal ramifications of getting caught with it?
+ If you've got any awesome (or terrifying) stories about your first time, I'd love to hear them.

I realise a lot of these questions could be Googled (and I am in fact doing that as well), but I'm geeking out and compiling information from several sources so I can make a well-informed decision.

1287200287.0	drx95	A few tips from your friends at r/trees	B3bop	54	17	20	"**1.** If you're going to short something make sure you blow the smoke out. It'll taste less like ass when you light it back up.

**2.** For better burning, pre roast your weed (heat it up a bit with a lighter but don't burn it).

**3.** If you're new to packing and you're having a hard time keeping your bowl lit then it's probably packed too tight, dump out and repack.

**4.** Always keep your pieces clean, especially when smoking with friends. It tastes better, looks better, and keeps you from looking dirty.

**5.** Practice rolling with tobacco or the same weed over a large flat surface (so you don't lose the ground weed) until you get the hang of it. It's a great skill to have and surprisingly hard to do.

**6.** Always treat your dealer well and he will (most likely) do the same with you.

**7.** Hot water in bongs makes it easier on your throat and makes a smoother hit. While cold water (with or without ice) makes the smoke stack better and for experienced smokers can smooth the hit.

**8.** Most people cough because the smoke expands while in your lungs, so don't pull in a bunch of air after a hit or fill your lungs completely or you'll be more prone to coughing.

**9.** Air tight containers will keep your nugs fresh and keep the thc from leaving it (I use pill containers, but depending on how much you have airtight jars can be used too. Bags will work in a pinch but will never be completely air tight).

**10.** Always carry eye drops and an extra lighter, most new ents have a tendency to lose lighters and eye drops are always good to have, even when not smoking. (A lot of people use rhotos, I personally like bausch &amp; lamb's Opcon-A as it works just as well if not better for me without the burn).

**11.** If you don't live on your own, have several hiding spots and always disperse your weed/paraphernalia between them so if you're caught you don't lose all of it.

**12.** You can get a P.O. box for like $30 a year, and always get the smallest one because the post office will hold your package anyways. this way you can buy things online and not have to rush home worrying about someone else opening it.

**13.** Always know how big a hit you can take, so you don't waste your weed (or even worse someone else's)

**14.** If the bowl is cherried, try to relight it just by drawing smoke in instead of with a lighter as the lighter's flame is hot enough to destroy the thc, but the burning nug is not. (especially important with kief bowls).

**15.** Speaking of kief, never make it the top layer as you don't want the flame to touch the kief if you can help it because as previously mentioned, the flame is hot enough to destroy the thc.

**16.** Keep a drink nearby, cotton mouth is a bitch.

**17.** **NEVER** drink bong water.

**18.** THC is a relatively non-polar molecule, hence it being soluble in fat (a non-polar solvent) and not water (a polar solvent). Alcohol consists of non-polar carbon chains with polar alcohol groups attached, so it's somewhere between the two and thus can dissolve either non-polar or polar substances, but not as well in either case as fat or water would. In this case, you can dissolve THC in it -- losing more than you would if you used water, but not by a whole lot.
Theoretically, you could make cannamilk by sticking it in a bong, but that's really gross.

**19.** Don't use liquor as a bong water, it removes some of the thc from the smoke. (debated, but most people believe it and why take the chance?).

**20.** Appreciate the taste of good bud and you'll gain bonus points from many more experienced smokers.

**21.** You can change out your bong water with flavored waters or sodas to change the taste (though I've never noticed a difference to be honest).

**22.** The cheapest upgrade you can make to a bong is to get a diffuser stem, it costs around $20 where I'm at. (alternatively you can use bb's or small beads as diffuser beads for even less, but I'm not sure if the plastic is bad for you).

**23.** When shopping for pieces, do your research or bring a more experienced smoker along, and don't be afraid to wait. (you'll also usually get better deals online).

**24.** If there's a need to mask the smell you can make a sploof by taking an empty toilet paper roll and filling it with dryer sheets. (for a better, but harder to make sploof drill holes in the bottom of a small bottle and fill it with carbon pellets (I can't remember the actual name right now, but you can find them at pet stores, usually by the fish) then rubber band a dryer sheet around the open top so they don't spill out on you).

**25.** Dealers usually give discounts if you buy larger amounts, so getting together with some friends to buy a lot then splitting it up is often a good idea if you have a scale or means to separate it.

**26.** Getting caught with a scale automatically elevates possession to intent to distribute, so be very careful of bringing them with you/having them out in the open.

**27.** In a pinch you can make a pipe out of almost anything. (a pen, an apple, soda can/water bottle, etc.) some people enjoy building their own.

**28.** Vaporizers are great, but quickly increase your tolerance so be careful with using them as your only means of smoking. (the already vaped bud can also be smoked regularly or used in place of tobacco in joints/blunts as it's drier but still contains cannabinoids)

**29.** If you can't roll you can always get a roller from a head shop or online which makes it incredibly easy (as long as you have papers that fit)

**30.** Cologne or axe does NOT cover up weed, but for most people makes it more obvious.

**31.** The best way to cover up the smell of weed smoke is with cigarette smoke.

**32.** You can chew gum or use the on the go toothbrushes (these work better, think they're made by crest or something) to get the smell of weed off your breath.

**33.** If you're being pulled over and want to get rid of the smell of weed on your breath, only use mouthwash if there's absolutely no chance you'll be breathalyzed as it contains high concentrations of alcohol and will make you blow falsely high *this is debated, and not from my personal experience so it could very well be false.

**34.** Blown out speakers make great places to hide paraphernalia as you can remove 3/4 screws and swing the top open (kind of like butterfly doors on a lambo) and nobody ever suspects it. (pens also work for skinny joints if you cut the stem [part holding the ink), but it is messy as the ink will flow out after cutting so be careful).

**35.** Don't use a zippo to light your bowl, it's harder to use and emits more gas, making your hit taste nasty (and it can't be good for you).

**36.** Smoke the corners. Imagine the bowl in four sections and try to light only one of those sections. That'll save you from ""scorching"" (quickly burning up) your trees.

**37.** If your joint is really tight (hard to pull when smoking), use a thin poker (swiss army toothpick's are ideal) and push the joint innards through the roach up about 5mm. The joint will now smoke perfectly, this works EVERYTIME.

**38.** Some people don't have Iron Lungs and that full bong might look intimidating. Put your hand on top of the bong and take some long deep breathes to get some oxygen in your blood stream, if there is an ice pinch this also gives time for some of the smoke to cool down. Take your hand off and clear the bong. Stop after the bong is empty — the gas will expand in your lungs and you want to leave room.

**39.** Ask around and learn how to properly pack a tobacco pipe, take everything you learn and use it to pack your cannabis pipe. If done right it will be cherry easily and you won't have to poke ash out of the way.

**40.** Buy a pipe tool. They cost around 2 bucks and can be bought at any tobacconist and it will be your best friend. Plus even experienced smokers will be impressed with this device.

**41.** When you're smoking a joint and its on the last third; making passing awkward; pass right hand to right hand or left to left and go index to index then pinch with the thumb. It's the best passing method and it always works.

**42.** For joints, blank business cards make good roaches (also called crutches). cut around any sections with ink; don't need that in your lungs.

**43.** Leaving baking soda in a dish overnight can absorb some of the smoke smell in your car.

**44.** If you need to cover the smell in your car immediately -- maybe if you're being pulled over -- light a cigarette.

**45.** Blowing smoke through a tube with a dryer sheet will mask the smell.

**46.** Eating an apple will remove smoke breath (and cotton mouth). They also taste great.

**47.** Trying to light a roach on your stove because you lost all your matches and lighters could result in you smelling your hair being burned.

**48.** Take hits you're comfortable with, and go at your own pace. getting high should be enjoyable. there's no need to treat it as a pissing match with friends/strangers.

**49.** If you're not the provider of the trees don't try to fill up your lungs and kill the bowl in one hit. This will annoy every one else.

**50.** If you're smoking some one else's trees and you have trees yourself offer to match them on the trees you smoked or offer to throw some of yours into the bowl or even green-cap it. This will win you some cool points and respect with whom ever you're smoking with.

**51.** **Lastly:** Enjoy the process. Relax and breath.

It was merely described as 'Zzzzz-zing' on the packet.
The leaves were chopped up, but they were flat, skinny and pale grey, and the smoke smelt kind of musky.

It got me REALLY high, It was a sort of body experience I guess you could say:

Loss of balance
Tingling, insides felt like they were flipping
Complete loss of concentration
Strobe-time lapse type effect similar to weed
Complete disorientation.
Gave me a radical head-ache afterwards.

Anyone know what it might be?

So basically I'm around 75% sure that what I smoked was 'spice'

1337125232.0	tp25h	Saplings and higher, i NEED help! My sister might be toking, and im worried she might get caught, or is smoking with the wrong people.	Lamseben	44	9	24	"I thought about posting this for a week, but only just got to do it today.

I started suspecting her for toking after she started coming home some days, smelling like trees.
i dont think it's a bad thing but i kinda hoped for me to be the one introducing her to trees, (as a trial for entering enthood lol.) im really confused and dont know what exactly i should do. I really want to nip it in the heels before it turns sour, Im thinking about looking through her stuff, but i dont think it would be etically correct, i mean, shes not going through my stuff, so im worried of freaking her out.

Shes almost 16 and im 17 close to 18.
Long story short: My 15 year old sister might be toking, and im thinking of looking through her stuff, i dont want her to get hurt, and she might smoke with bad people. What should i do?

Update: I talked with her today when she got home, it was awkward, for about 5 seconds, but generally it turned out great! The talk went something like:

''Hey, you smell nice today'' (Wtf was i thinking 0.o) *She smelled like weed as always

''Uhm, thanks? whats going on?''

5 seconds pass and i tell her: ''well, i was just thinking of pulling out my best friend...''

Still not completely sure of how to react she says: ''Your best friend? whats wrong with you, are you high? *jokingly

I then looked her in the eyes and said: ''Not yet... Wanna come smoke with me?''

We then had the most intimate brother-sister talk about how i was always gonna be there for her, and after i got done pouring out my thoughts, she jokingly said: ''You know, if we were ever in prison together, i would totally shank someone if they looked at you the wrong way...''

We then proceeded to blaze, and i taught her how to use a bong, also, she showed me her stash which i threw out, shitty weed wasnt good enough.

Thank you for all your help. Best community ever?"	t5_2rukl	True

My boyfriend will be toking with me Saturday, but, as fun as it is to toke alone and watch netflix, I can't help but feel like I'm missing a big part of toking.

So what are your suggestions for things to do alone when stoned?

I currently watch netflix and play doodleordie.

I now understand why people love it so much! At first I didn't think anything was going to happen but then I got dizzy and felt like everything was in slow motion / 2 seconds ago. So I quickly took a shower (I smoked in the bathroom with the water on) before I got to high , pack everything up and go back to my room. Then I just sit down in my chair and my legs start to feel all tingly and I started to twitch kind of (is this normal?). After a few minutes of just chilling there I decided to listen to some music. 

This song actually: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WexftEYwaRU 

It sounded AMAZING, I closed my eyes and there was colors flashing to music and I could feel the fucking music! It was insane, I could completely focus on JUST the song and nothing else it was so clear and I felt like I was floating... It was beautiful.

I'm in a lovely relationship with the man I love (f/m, both mid/early 20s), and we've been together almost 6 years now. We've had our ups and downs, but things between us have been wonderful. The down side? He is 100% absolutely against trees. He thinks they are terrible. I myself was the same way for a while, but while I was going through a lot of rough things and we were on hiatus as a couple for a few months I took the plunge with some mutual friends and got high. It was a very enlightening experience. It helped my anxiety, it helped my depression. For 2 hours I felt just felt good and had no hangover threatening to kill me the next day.  I absolutely want to start smoking casually. I'm a 5th year senior in college that is completely over going out and getting smashed. I just want to sit around at home and watch Dr. Who and get high.

My question for you is this: How do I go about opening him up to the idea of me using them for recreational use? How do I help him realize that when used responsibly it could really improve my way of life? It doesn't have to be with him, or in front of him (we still live apart). I just want him to not threaten to end the loving relationship we have. I want acceptance and understanding, just like one would with any aspect of a relationship.

I haven't smoked since, and I will not smoke unless we come to a mutual agreement. I respect him and his opinion, but I want him to realize that it may be founded in misinformation. Let me know your thoughts

my niece is 17, 18 next year (she visits during the summer from the south to NY/NJ). my bro is not very good at hiding his ent status, emerging from the garage, eyes red with the familiar smell of ""jah"" in the background. i say familiar because my niece lives in TX with her mother. of course, at her high school, almost all the children smoke marijuana. she's just naturally around it all the time. so she KNOWS when poppa ent is at a [5], so to speak. 

as uncle ent, she will speak to me about certain things because i never over react. i was a teen once and i know the feeling of not being able to talk to the parental units about things. so i act as that bridge - never judgmental, always available to talk. sometimes parents get into overcontrol mode so uncles like me are a necessity. anyway, as uncle ent aka the bridge, i was able to talk her into waiting to smoke (realistically, we can't stop her), bring up the topic to her father, and block any attempts at my bro being a two-faced parent - narc by day/ent by night. once you're two-faced, you lose credibility as a person, not just a parental figure. 

now, after a few years, we're at this point. she's going to be a legal adult and it's better that she be introduced by responsible tokers (and growers) who actually know wtf they're doing as opposed to her dumb ass friends who can't even keep their pants pulled up.

when it comes to the green, she probably knows more than some long time ents. we've been teaching her everything from general use to cultivation to politics. her brother will have his time next year. he's already thinking in stealth mode, taking after his daddy ent. when it's his time, he'll be just as ready.

Sometimes less, sometimes more, depending on our situation. I've smoked with him on occasion and it never really seems to affect me--save for one time where I ended up smoking too much and felt like I was going to die for a few hours... I didn't feel it at all until it hit me all at once like that. Is there something I could be doing wrong?


Anyway, not knowing what it's like to be stoned makes it kind of difficult for me to understand why he does it so often. That makes me uncomfortable with it, and I would like not to be. I've asked him about it and he says it's his way of self-medicating, that his thoughts are normally pretty restless/all over the place, so it helps him to think more clearly and be more productive. However, almost every other stoner I hang out with (which isn't many, really) refers to it as ""getting stupid"" or things like that, which seems pretty contradictory to what he's saying. Is it different for everyone or is he BSing me here? Why do YOU do it? What's it like?


He seems pretty normal still when he's high, he just rambles a little more and his jokes get even cheesier. He doesn't veg out or anything and is even way more likely to kick my ass at Scrabble. Soo is it not a problem?


I'm just kind of concerned with the frequency. A few times a week, okay, whatever. But a few times a day? I don't get it. Is it a filling-the-void-in-your-life type thing? Because I can't help but see it that way. I've had experience with a couple of other substances and I can't imagine doing either of those on a daily basis unless I found my life incredibly dull. The thought of that being the case with him just makes me... sad.


Also, I guess I feel kinda left out. I don't like being not sober without him, and I don't like being sober without him either! It's obviously something he enjoys a lot and I wish I could enjoy it with him every once in a while!

This guy somehow convinced me to buy a sack of shake off of him that he claimed to have bought from the dispensary. I told him to pack a bowl of it first so I could see its quality. I'm now thinking that he already planned for this to happen, and packed some actual weed in the bowl for me to test. I thought that if it was of this quality, it would definitely be worth buying, despite it being ground up.

I didn't really exam the bag much because I didn't feel a need to (I thought I could trust this guy). But now that I look at it, it doesn't look right. At first glance, it appears to just be normal ground up weed,  but when I more closely exam it, it looks wrong. There's a few leaves that look bright yellow, and there is long, thin, orange sticks scattered throughout the bag as well. Furthermore, it just doesn't seem to smell like weed to me. It definitely does not smell skunky at all, but rather like an actual blend of spices and herbs. There also seems to be a small smell of mint as well. 

The first reason I got suspicious of this shit though was that it gave me a weird high. I didn't feel the usual feeling of calmness and relaxation that I get with weed, but rather a high-strung, twitchy kind of feeling. I also feel rather unsociable and indifferent. Another thing is, one hit of this will make me feel very stoned, whereas I usually have to smoke a full bowl to reach this level, as I have built up a tolerance. 

I have bought sacks off this guy in the past, and they were always satisfactory quality. I also consider him a good friend of mine, who I often hang out with, which is another reason I'm so reluctant to say he ripped me off. 

I don't know, can someone put my mind at ease?

1372200962.0	1h2j2m	I'm suffering from crohn's disease and have been feeling extra shitty (no pun intended haha) lately, and I have a few questions regarding medical cannabis. Any answers/advice would be appreciated. Thanks! (xpost)	TrypE25	38	6	34	"(I posted to /r/trees first, but I realize that this is probably a more appropriate place for these types of questions).


Hey /r/saplings, I'm a 20 year old guy who has been suffering from crohn's disease since high school. Fortunately, I live in California. Unfortunately, I'm still financially dependent on my very, very anti-drug parents, and I still am on their medical insurance plan.

For the past two years, I've been experiencing worsening and more frequent pain and nausea from this condition, and it's been really disrupting my life. The only thing that somewhat helps works is a liver-terrorizing dose of Tylenol, but I want to avoid that for obvious reasons.


A few of my friends were nice enough to let me try week last year, and I had a really positive experience with it. Apart from the usual awesome stuff you all know, I finally felt pain-free for a few hours, and was able to eat without the fear of having to throw up. I've toked up with them sporadically over the past year, and it's helped pretty much each time, but I feel bad for continuously mooching off of them.

So - I think it would be ideal for me to try to get a card. But, I have a few questions.

1) Do I even qualify for MMJ in California? I read the law, and it seems to only allow it for really serious conditions. I'm in pain, sure, but I'm still able to do most of my normal activities most of the time. It's only really bad once every few months, when I can't move or eat or anything.

2) If I do qualify, is it possible to get a card without using my parents' insurance/having it show up on my medical record? Sadly, there's no way they'd allow me to try this route for relief.

3) If I do manage to get a card, would vaping hash oil be similarly effective? I'd prefer not to smoke, but I've also read that hash oil is primarily composed of THC, while CBD is the main compound that helps with the pain. While I'd obviously love some sweet head highs, if I'm going to use this medically, I want to make sure that it would be effective.

4) Are any of you suffering from a similar condition? Does weed help? Or is it just my wishful thinking?


I'm living with my parents this summer, but I'm going back to UC Berkeley for college this fall, so I think it'd be ideal if I can try to get the card right before I head back - while I'd still be on my parents' insurance plan, at least I'd be in my own apartment and have my own car. I'd really appreciate any answers/advice. Thanks again ents!"	t5_2rukl	True
1370316426.0	1fmnpb	Etiquette for repeatedly smoking friend's weed	kittenwithscurvy	35	5	17	"So I'm back in my hometown for the summer and while I smoke quite a bit away at school, I never did while living at home, so I have no hook-ups for purchasing bud. A good friend of mine smokes a lot and since I've been home (a couple weeks now), we've smoked together a bunch of times. 

Generally, I know that etiquette is that you share your bud and don't ask for any payment and I offered a couple times when we smoked, but she always very nicely said no and that she was just happy to be smoking together, since we never got the chance to when we were younger.

Anyways, I asked her once via text if she could hook me up with her dealer so I wouldn't be smoking hers all the time, but she never answered. I don't know if she didn't get the text or didn't want to answer or just forgot or what. 

Basically, I'm just not sure how to proceed from here.

Edit: First off, thanks for the comments. The Reddit community will never cease to amaze me. And, as it seems, you guys are all saying wait a couple more years, and due to where I am at in my life, I'm going to. This question actually spawned from my friend wanting me to go smoke with him after my game yesterday. I have always been told learn to say no early, and out of habit, I answered no. However, a lot has changed in my life (Me becoming atheist, my mom finding a partner who has 3 kids) so it's made me look at other aspects. Especially from all the hype about getting cannabis legalized in CO and other states. I have looked into it, and it has made me realize with cannabis and a lot of other things, you only hear about the bad things with it. And you guys have introduced some good things. Anyways, sorry for the ramble. Again, thanks for the input. You guys rock."	t5_2rukl	True

It's my first post here so I bet sploofs have been mentioned before, but if not I thought i'd let you in on my most helpful tool in my smoking arsenal.

A sploof is nothing more than a paper towel roll with a stack of dryer sheets rubberbanded (or duct taped) to it. All of these things are things that can be easily attained and you probably already have them lying around. After you take a hit, put your mouth to the open end of the tube and blow your smoke through the dryer sheets at the other end. The smoke that comes out has not only been lessened by going through the sheets, but the sheets also take the smell of the pot away and replace it with a more 'clean' smell. I wish I knew about this earlier. If you're in a house, dorm, or apartment that you can't smoke in, it's a good way to be sneakier and therefore smarter!

I don't think she is going to hate me for this, so I'm going to stop smoking at least at home and try to see what I can do to change her mind. I ordered ""The Union"" to watch with her.

Yesterday I decided to toke up before my shower. it usually takes me 4 regular hits to get comfortably high. So I get right to it. I take 3 small hits. When I exhaled, no smoke seemed to appear, so I thought that I mustn't have really have taken any hits. So I take 4 more. I go upstairs to pack away my pipe and weed, and take a shower.

This is where it began to get a bit weird. The moment I step into the shower, an immense burst of pressure is now present behind my eyes. It felt as though they were trying to escape my skull. That went away after thinking about something else. A tad later, when I began to wash my hair, it was as though I could feel every one of my hair follicles being touched and my mouth seemed *extremely* small. After leaving the shower, it began very hard to hear things for about 5 minutes. It was as though someone clapped their hands next to my ears, and my hearing became static-y and obscured by a faint ringing.

The rest of the night was a blur, and  I could not really remember anything besides *needing* to eat otherwise I would feel uneasy and dizzy. My experience was a bit daunting, I have to say. I have actually considered staying away from trying cannabis anymore.

My question to you guys, is did I get too high? Or was my experience based on an entirely different issue? Am I being too quick to quit?

Now I should state that I haven't toked in about two months - maybe longer. And I should also state the last times I smoked up I was with good friends and just chill with it, and the following didn't really take place.

However, when I first started smoking about two years ago I used to love everything at face value. Like, I wouldn't normally notice it in either a positive or negative light, but whilst high I would see the colours, the nature, the buildings, the lights and everything around me as so interesting, vivid, enjoyable.

But recently I've been going through some experiences when I smoke. Like, I'm pretty interested in the world and I know a little bit about, say, international relations, and the different gas supplies in Europe and different corporations and things. All that stuff I'm half educated in. And I just feel like it's all pointless. Now, perhaps there's some good stuff created in there. Like my guitar, it makes me feel nice to just play with the strings and here the music. And some songs etc help me. But it seems like all of this stuff we've built up, this civilized world, is pointless and erroneous and if humanity had just dealt with its issues it would never have found the need to get to 7,000,000,000 people and have energy wars, and massive pipelines cutting through the ground, and people driving about in cars, and dingy blocks of flats and unhappy families in cramped council housing...eugh.

It's like, I can enjoy the weed still. I like its effect. It chills me out and shit. It's just, everything I see around me... especially living in a city... and everything I know of the world... is just pointless.

And the thing is that at the moment, not having toked for a couple of months, I'm kind of coping. I'm making good steps towards my career, making plans for the future and stuff. But when I get high (at least, as of 2-3 months ago), I just seem to get stuck in a rut surrounded by stuff that other people care about (like exams), but I - vainly and stupidly - feel too smart to just take at face value and enjoy.

1359494570.0	17iom8	Keep it safe, keep it secret, keep it legitimate.	Ragged_Man	42	9	15	"If you happen to use a pipe (either glass or wood etc) try and keep an opened bag of tobacco with it at all times, even smoke a little bit of it with the pipe. The stench of tobacco will remain prevalent for a while, and along with the bag with it you have a legitimate reason for carrying the piece. 

Now I know for some people being caught with tobacco is still not very nifty, but it beats getting busted for the alternative. This can come in handy especially if you are caught by say police etc and you can claim a legal use of your piece and you have evidence to back it up (but I suggest hide the good stuff better then you hide the pipe) 

Also to add, there is a slight downside to this as well. You might get a slight after taste of tobacco if you use too much (also remember it is meant to be smoked differently **DO NOT HOLD IN LUNGS** )

Hope this helps you evade scrutiny in the future.

TLDR: keep tobacco with your pipe and smoke a bit in it to mask the scent. "	t5_2rukl	True

1) When toking, make sure you take in air periodically in a hit and don't let smoke pool up in your trachea and mouth, you are wasting smoke you could enjoy!



2) Firmmmly grasp whatever piece you're using, but don't try to give it the choke of death. You don't wanna drop it, but you don't want shards in your hand either.



3) If you need to have clear eyes, use artificial tears, not visine.



4) Possibly one of the most important rules: if you are carrying trees, carry in small amounts. This will keep you from getting stuck with intent to sell if you get caught



5) If you are approached by an officer, you may refuse a search. Unless the cop has a warrant or has probable cause beyond anything which could be construed as profiling. The officer cannot ask you to empty your pockets because you have on a rasta beanie. If you don't want to tell a cop no, simply say ""Sir, I would like to exercise my rights given to me in the fourth amendment of the United States Constitution.""



6) Don't steal from or wreck anyone's belongings. This should be a no-brainer, but I see it happen time and time again. Treat everyone's stuff a thousand times better than your own. How would you like it if someone ran in your house after you smoked them out and stole your lighter, or a painting or spilled drinks everywhere.

Been smoking a couple months now after a 10 year tolerance break.  Nothing state ordered or anything, just didn't really feel like toking again after I graduated high school. Anywhoser - My normal routine is to toke up and chill watching TV or playing a game online. 

Tonight after toking about as much as I usually do, I decided to lay down in my room and try listening to ""trippy music."" Cue ""Ambient"" channel on pandora. 

After a while I could swear I saw Simba in the spackle on my ceiling. I thought that was hilarious. After cracking up about this to myself for a bit, I calm down and realize I can make it feel like my eyeballs are being pushed out when I stuck out my tongue. Don't ask. Sounds stupid to a [2] me now.

Afterward, I became very aware of my arms. I almost felt like the bones in my arms were very lightly vibrating and I could sense what they looked like, just by the way the vibrations felt. Again, don't ask.

I'm not a meditator, but I can definitely see where pot could help one meditate. It was so peaceful and I felt at ease for the first time in years.

Oh, right, okay. Decide to smoke like, 0.4 grams, which is a LOT to me, in a coffee can bowl [this](http://www.commonsensewithmoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/illy_issimo-300x300.jpg)

In my bathroom, shower running on steam, fan and vent and door bottom covered. Did that, (Before I got high I flipped the can but it all landed on a towel thank god) Okay anyways I was like, Okay I should get out of this room, gotta breath this smoke, get it out

after of course seeing into the can and seeing some tiny bits that fell in :(
Hit it against my hand like 20 times, kinda hurt, not bad though, got a lot of ashy coffee, from like, those rings of drink you can never get in the can, such bullshit by the way

1329268520.0	ppzrb	first timer's guide for obsessive worriers with a glass pipe	stonercommando	36	8	9	"The goal:

To have a pleasant newbie experience with your glass pipe and weed.

The plan:

You're going to take one or two hits.  Later on when you're more comfortable with the ride, you can try more.  But not now.

Cautions:

* consider weed to be a mood ENHANCER, not a mood CHANGER.  thus if you are in a bad mood, save it for later, unless you want to be in a worse mood.

* you might cough.  later you will get better at smoking and this won't be as big of an issue.

* people on youtube take monster hits.  you don't need to do that, those people are showing off.  you can get plenty high on small hits, and for now, giant hits will make you cough.

* weed is not toxic, nobody has ever died from weed.  but you can do stupid shit while sober or stoned, so don't walk in front of a bus in either condition.  for fuck's sake, don't drive while stoned.

* don't talk to cops while sober or stoned.  don't take your weed outside.

* if you're not listening to your favorite music, you're doing it wrong.  music is essential, whatever else you are doing while stoned.

* don't take any other drugs, including alcohol.  later when you're more comfortable with the experience, go for it.  but not now.

The procedure:

1) have a trusted friend with you, either an experienced stoner or at least someone who cares for you. second best: have them on your phone's speed dial.

2) pick an activity to do while high, and have everything laid out and prepared.  if you're listening to music, have it queued up.  if you're going for a walk, have your shoes on.  if you're going to nap, no preparation is necessary.

3) break off a pea-sized chunk of material.  put it into the pipe, making sure it isn't going to get sucked through the hole.  stuff it down a little so it won't fall out, but not so much that the hole is clogged.

4) Hold the pipe in your right hand, thumb over the carb hole on the side of the pipe.

5) apply flame to the material, inhale just enough to get some smoke flowing into your lungs.  try to also get some air from the sides of your mouth at the same time (don't clamp down on the pipe) to cool the smoke as it flows from the pipe.  after you've inhaled a bit, open the carb hole and inhale whatever remains in the pipe.  still inhaling, suck down some fresh air.  hold it a little bit, then exhale.

6) repeat once at most, for now.

7) go drink some cool water to soothe your mouth.

8) chew some gum to get your saliva flowing to combat potential dry mouth.

9) burn some incense or something to get rid of the smell.

10) don't worry about leftovers.  put your pipe away and smoke them later.  they will keep just fine, even partially burnt.

Things to do now:

* go for a walk

* listen to some epic guitar solos

* watch a funny movie

* play video games

* browse reddit, at last the comments are interesting!

* eat something, anything.  it will be delicious!

The future:

* figure out how to take cooler hits to reduce coughing.

* figure out how to take bigger hits to get a punchier high.

* find out the differences between smoking a little and smoking a lot.  both are enjoyable, but very different experiences.

* cook a meal.  nothing is more fun while stoned, except eating your meal.

* ride your bicycle while stoned.

* clean your glass pipe: put vodka or rubbing alcohol into a ziploc bag.  add kosher salt.  add pipe.  seal bag, shake until pipe is clean.  rinse with fresh water.  worry about proportions some other time!

* get a vaporizer.  because you're an obsessive worrier, you are worried about your lungs.  vapor is the way to go.  science suggests that weed smoking is safer than tobacco smoking, but it's still smoking.

If you freak out:

1) you're not going to freak out.  people have been smoking for thousands of years and they're not into it because it sucks.

2) have your friend distract you.  call them if they're not with you.

3) remember: nobody has ever died from weed.  you will not be the first.  the effects last 1-4 hours, and if you 
only took two hits, even less than that.

4) people take weed to combat nausea.  if you're nauseous, it's not the weed, weed fixes that.  have some water, lie down.

5) people take weed to combat freakouts caused by other drugs.  so weed combats the freakouts -- why are you freaking out?  weed makes you caaaallllm.

6) just go to sleep.  people take weed to combat insomnia, weed will help you fall asleep.  when you wake up you'll be sober.

I've read up on the plant and come to the conclusion that it is not as harmful as some people make it out to be (Norway here). Most people I know seem to think it's just as bad as meth, that it makes you crazy, addicted, chronicly drowsy and you immidietaly start smoking crack and cocaine after trying it once while your house catches on fire and all of your family members die a horrible painfully slow death and your cat gets run over.

Edit: Thanks for the replies!
Here's what I learned: it's largely a matter of personal taste, and people like it because they feel:

* Greens taste/feel better
* Greens contain more THC/g
* Greens get them higher
* They want to maximize the value of their weed
* They would rather relight than have to nurse a cherry
* It 's more aesthetically pleasing

I'm headed to the mighty city of Amsterdam later in the year with some friends and i have a few questions. In my group of frients I'm *generally* the most versed in stoner etiquette and general smoke knowledge and i don't wanna be the guy who makes himself look like an idiot tourist (even though i will be)

So, I'll fire off some quick(ish) questions and any/all input plus any other tips / experiences that spring to mind would really help a brother out.

* What can i expect to pay (in euros) for, for example an 8th of good weed? Something like a Vanilla Kush or Some Amnesia. Don't wanna have to run to an atm, or get screwed over, or do that awkward double take.

* In smoke shops, is it the done thing to roll your own shit inside the cafe? (I love to roll, i find it therapeutic and a huuuge part of the smoking experience.) If a couple of my buddies who can't roll go to another place are the guys and gals who work there happy to roll for them?

* Kinda related to above, is it advisable to just grab a grinder and shit whilst I'm over there? Or is there enough of a price hike (if any) to motivate me into giving my grinder a hella good clean and taking it with me?

* Where are you cool to smoke? Like the cafes, yeah... but Hotel balconies? Parks and Gardens? - What are the local authorities attitude towards tourists? (We're not asshole ents, we're nice and chill!)

* Generally, do people stick to joints in cafes? I mean, does anyone use glassware or anything, is it considered obnoxious to do so? I presume blunts are fine. I'm also a smoker of cigarettes, and love one after a joint -  is this cool inside cafes?

* Any direct recommendations of specific cafes you found particularly friently / easy going?

* Do i just speak English? I'd imagine alot of them would, but then again the whole idiot tourist thing... Should i learn how to ask for an eighth in dutch or anything? Any specific stoner sayings in dutch that it's good to learn?

* Obviously we don't just wanna crash in cafes all day... any awesome shit to see or do? Any good parks or countryside to find a secluded smoke spot outside of the city?

Peffico	36	5	7	"Hello there fellow ents and hello my saplings (I love saplings). I decided to make this post since more and more states and more and more people are going medical cannabis. So I though I would just let everyone here know about what you can and can not do with a medical marijuana recommendation. I also talk about what I went through to get it. And most of all I just want you guys to be safe!

**What exactly is a recommendation?**

-A recommendation is exactly what it is. A recommendation on a piece of paper from a doctor saying that your pain/anxiety/stress will be subsided with the help of cannabis. It is usually good for up to one year. (depends on the state.) Your rec(ommendation) allows you to go to **licensed** cannabis dispensaries and legally buy cannabis from there.

**Then what the flap is this card I hear?**

Here is the key difference a card can only be obtained after you get your rec. You pay an extra fee and you get an I.D. card to go with your rec. Basically it says to cops ""Yes officer, I do have a legal recommendation."" More on this later. 
Do you need a card? No
Is it a good idea to have one? Yes

**How do I go about getting this rec?**

Well first off you need to live a state that allows medical cannabis. 
[Pretty helpful link for what you can posses in your state](http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000881)

**What if I don't?**

If you live near the border of state that's next to a medical state just go there. However your rec won't help you with your state's P.D.

**And if I do?**

Now it's time to find a doctor that will analyze you. A quick search of google and your state should be sufficient enough to find a doctor. However always ask around or read reviews about doctors who give out recs. Always find out this about them.

* 1. Are they licensed by your state? (If they aren't they your rec isn't worth anything.)
* 2. How relax are they on giving you your card?
* 3. How much is it?
* 4. Do I need any medical records? (More on this later)

Also always calling the place that will evaluate you is always good. Just don't ask how chill they are lol.

*Pro tip* 

*Go to a dispensary with a friend who has their rec and look around the place. Usually the have deals that will knock quite a few dollars off your evaluation.*

Next it's time to go see a doctor. If you need medical records bring them. All states say you need them, but a lot of doctors will say you don't need to bring them in. Also bring money and an I.D.

Fill out a few forms and you are ready to see the doctor.

*Pro tip* 

*Try to avoid anything to with past medical visits to hospitals. They will need those records too and it's just a hassle. but sometimes it can't be avoided.*

Next you go in and see the doctor tell him why you feel you would benefit from cannabis. He/She takes your blood pressure and viola you get your rec! 

*PRO TIPS ALL DAY BABY!* 

*My doctor was a dick, but that doesn't mean yours will be. But if they are please do not be nervous or intimidated it's like the DMV getting your drivers test except you most likely won't fail. And it doesn't take a quarter as long.* 

**So I got it now what?**

You can use it right away, so do what I did and find a **licensed** dispensary and buy whatever you want up to your states limit!

If you need help finding a place here's a useful link. [Weedmaps.com](http://legalmarijuanadispensary.com)

**So what am I immune to the police?**

Oh lord no you are not immune to our friends in the blue (I know a few cops they are nice people). If you do not have your medical I.D. card they can still arrest you if they suspect fraud on your rec. (Meaning your rec isn't legal). BUT if you have the nifty I.D. card the police can not arrest you for cannabis. (they can still arrest you for something else)

*Dodge the police tip* 

*I know not everyone is going to drive dry, but if you do get pulled over please do not inform them of any cannabis in your vehicle. You may get a DUI and a felony for just letting them know. And 9/10 they won't hassle you.*

[Also never agree to searches.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDJrQBwJpqk&amp;feature=channel&amp;list=UL)


**Can I enjoy cannabis anywhere?**

You sure can as long as they allow tobacco in the same place. I wouldn't recommend going to public places though you will get **A LOT** of heat and possibly some calls to the police.

**What can I buy?**

If your dispensary is licensed; anything they are willing to sell. Just remember your state limits.

**Can I grow it?**

Sure can check with your state and their laws about it first though.

**Can I sell it?**

NO! NO! NO! NO! NEVER SELL IT TO ANYONE! It is a felony and you will lose your rec **FOREVER** if you are caught selling. And if it's to a minor you may face prison time. 

**But I want to!**

Then get registered by the state to do so and open up a dispensary.

**What else can't I do**

It's easier to say what you can't do because it's shorter of what you can do lol.

* do not drive
* do not operate heavy machinery
* Keep your stash in your trunk if you are going somewhere with it.


**So what's your story how did you get yours?**

I had a lot of friends who have theirs. And I wanted mine. So I went to a doctor and got it. That was...... 6 months ago so my renewal is coming up soon. Which I have no Idea how that is gonna go as the place I got mine started demanding medical records which I do not want to give. But if it is a problem over there I will just find a different location and get a brand new one again. I have probably bought...... oh lord A LOT of cannabis legally now and I love it.

*TL;DR* Umm fuck you? do it on your own then.

So, yesterday being the 19th, i figured I should finally buy a small piece to usher in 420. It's nothing special, a miniature Jack Daniels bottle bubbler, and a grinder. So I took around the same amount I'd been smoking from various fruit pipes, ground it up, and packed a pretty large bowl, and of course, didn't stop untill I couldn't feel my legs because I'm dumb haha. I  came back inside, sat down and put on some music (It was [Omnia, Crone of War](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arCEGYLL80), very tribal and very cool. I layed my head back, closed my eyes, and I saw incredible colours that I had never seen before, everything was dark and there was a single point of light, and from it, like lightning, these incredible colours spewed out (I'm colorblind normally, so I think that might have something to do with the colours). It was so incredible, when I finally came to afterwards I had no idea what happened, but I liked it, and so I didn't forget it I drew a picture. [I still can't look at this without the colours moving around and swapping places](http://imgur.com/SoCSzSL). I had no idea hallucinations were even possible with MJ, it was amazing, and my body just lost all control and just gently swayed with the music until after about an hour and a half I regained enough control to shut off everything and go to bed.

1340229228.0	vcm9x	Finally realized the difference between mids and dank.	GildedWraith	30	2	19	"Ok so I've been smoking for a few months.  Made my first purchase the other day.  An eighth of mids for 25 dollars.  Up to this point, I'd been smoking stuff that was pretty damn good quality.  My friend and I usually split a gram for 20 bucks and would fly to the moon about once or twice a week.

Well, I get these mids and the first thing i notice: they look like.......well exactly like mids would look like.  They were a little more compressed, more stemds, and less visable crystals (none tbh), but they still didn't look as bad as a lot of the shit i've seen on here labeled as ""dirt"" so I was feeling confident.

My experience:  took a grav of it.  Started feeling quite good pretty fast.  A little bit of a throbbing headache came with it, but it was negligable next to the high.  About 2 hours in, I start getting ferociously sleepy, and coming down.  Not used to that with all the dank I've been smoking since my ENT inauguration a few months ago.  The next day, I felt a big sluggish too.  Almost like a hangover, but only until I got in the shower.  Then it cleared up

Smoked a lot of it that night with a friend.  We all were high as kites, but the comedown was quick and tiring.  It felt like we had been doing physical labor for a few hours by the time we came down.  

Final verdict:  Worth the money, but I would still pay 20 for the Gram for the dank and use that as my main.

It gives a really nice high pretty quick, but dies down just as quickly and leaves a headache or tiredness in it's wake.  Certainly not something to be smoked when there are lots of the day's tasks still ahead.  It went down pretty hard down.  It tasted a bit like dirt, even though there wasn't visible dirt.  

that was my first experience with legitimate mids."	t5_2rukl	True
1338663810.0	uhi16	Sapling question on entiquette	TheBourbinator	34	5	21	So previously when I smoked I would usually just be among friends that had some trees and I would buy them pizza/beers/whatever as a thanks. Now that I've actually started acquiring my own trees I have no issue smoking out friends. What I'm not sure about is when someone you don't really know, or someone you aren't that great of friends with is around, and asks you if you have any trees or want to smoke (with your stuff). When I've smoked out people I don't know it has been on my own accord asking if they wanted to spark a bowl, at the same time if they know I have some (ie my roommate lets it slip), and I say no, I feel like it would kind of be a dick move. So ents, if you have some tasty dankness but don't want to smoke at the time, or share with certain people, is that improper entiquette?	t5_2rukl	True

She said that she didn't buy it, but if she ever caught me again, she would assume I was smoking weed, and tell my father and ground me. Since then, I thought to myself that I should get rid of all of my home-made paraphernalia and weed, and wait until I'm older to avoid this.

Here's my very incomplete list. What would yours look like? 

Also, anyone know a good way to avoid couchlock?

**Pro** 

* Passive enjoyment of things (music, tv, movies, etc.)

* Thought- I feel like I'll have ten times as many thoughts in the same time span and it consequently makes me feel like time goes a bit slower

* Increased sensitivity- my entire body tingles, and my newly grown beard tickles me when I talk or eat.

* Nearly everything is more enjoyable/interesting

* My mind feels sharper although I've yet to test this by attempting to perform any mental tasks while high

* I'll let myself get so high that I end up crashing on the sofa, watching Life or some other documentary while playing with my puppy and not go or do anything for several hours.

**Con**

* Spacing out makes me feel like time goes slower, which makes cardio (running and/or heavybag) feel like it goes on forever

* increased sensitivity- if my back was sore from sitting in a weird position, then it gets amplified by the high

* munchies- Cool ranch doritos are my kryponite, but I tend to get quite gluttonous when high

* I'll let myself get so high that I end up crashing on the sofa, watching Life or some other documentary while playing with my puppy and not go or do anything for several hours.

I rolled a pure what must have been 0.5-0.7g joint (pure because I don't smoke) and went out.

got to the park near my house and lit up, I had to smoke the entire thing as soon as possible as I mostly didn't want to get caught with it but also just didn't like the looks I was getting. after finishing the entire thing i sat on a bench for 5 minutes and my eyesight started moving constantly to the right my eyes literally wouldn't stay still. but then I looked around and just noticed all the flowers and how colourful everything was, everything so vibrant and glowing it was really strange but when I went to stand I just felt like if I stood i was going to fall straight over so i stayed their for a few minutes enjoying myself eventually managing to move around.

I got nearer the plants and sat under a tree for what was probably around 15 minutes but felt like hours, at this point I noticed improved hearing and could hear conversations from the other end of the street which I suddenly found fucking hilarious. trying to control my laughter was impossible so I just made my laughing quieter. 

I remember moving around from tree to tree because the sun kept moving into my eyes and it was so fucking beautiful but I didn't want to go blind so i moved. at one point i remember seeing some older couples sitting the other side of the flowerbed to me looking straight at me with the biggest smile on their faces ever, that kind of scared me but I didn't really think too much about it. 

Must have been an hour after I had smoked i started feeling like my heart was going to explode as it felt like it was beating really fast and my right kidney was in agony but I just remembered not to panic and it was all fine and I knew it couldn't be anything bad. at one point someone came up to me and asked if I was okay, I said I was but after that I had no clue what he was talking about but remember saying ""bye"" when he left even thought I've never met the guy in my life. 

I slightly remember waves of pulsing in my head that is just explainable but felt like the best thing ever. I think because I was against a tree I didn't like the thought of spiders or things crawling on me so I kept seeing black shadows over my shoulder or hearing noises that I just put down to my new spidey senses. 

I took a few pictures of my eyes while this happened as I wanted to know if it was still as red as the start because I needed some food and didn't want to turn up with really red eyes. ended up getting a burger and devouring it on the way home.

got home and passed out,the day after smoked was very strange to me, it felt like what i remembered slightly from the day before but a lot less intense and everything just looked amazing still. it's been a few days now and I've had a headache since but I slightly put that down to the weather and not drinking enough water.

I don't really know why I typed this but I hope this can give some people who are first timing some idea what will happen, I would also not suggest doing what I did (only take a few hits before you take any more, don't rush the thing) because at points I really wished the pain would go away but when it went everything was amazing.

So I sit at my computer for a while and do the usual, reading Reddit and watching funny gifs when I'm like ""I should probably get in the shower to get the smell off me."" So I hop in the shower (make the water really hot, as I like it) and I am in there for a while thinking before I actually start to wash my hair and as soon as I close my eyes I have this entirely new full body feeling like I am transcending everything and it is fucking crazy. So soon as I open my eyes I get the worst stomach ache and fell like I might throw up, so I bend over. I'm in that position for a while and the next thing I know my friend is in the bathroom freaking out like. ""What's wrong? How did you fall? I heard a big thump!"" I then come back to reality and realize that I am on the floor of the shower and I fell and knocked down all the bottles. I get out of the shower because at this point we need to pretend we are asleep in case her parents come down. So I get a towel, dry myself off, and start putting on my clothes. I look at myself in the mirror and, what do ya know, my face is ghost pale (and a little bit yellow-y and my lips are slightly blue.

I roll it, we head out to smoke. I'm assuming I really overestimated our capabilities. After we had smoked 1/3 of the joint my friend says he's had enough.

We both take another hit and as I'm putting out the joint he's leaning against the door and then falls down on his knees and says ""spaceship"" this is the part where I think he's kidding. 

Of course he wasn't and this is where I start to freak out, my heart starts racing I put the joint down and started supporting him. 20-30 seconds goes by and he begins coming back, so I help him up and ask him to open the door, once it's open he just falls down and has spasms. Now I'm really fucking freaking out, I go inside to hide the joint. 

As I'm fumbling through my stuff he staggers inside and says he's feeling better now, we sit down and watch Wilbur but I can't settle down, my heart was racing and everything just felt wrong. Eventually I switch to Adventure time because I found Wilbur was too scary (Ep2 or 3 where it starts out with one of them being paranoid)

We sit through 3 episodes of Adventure Time before we decide to head to bed, I thought it would be best and I hoped I'd feel better if I could just sleep it off.

On our way in my friend obviously starts feeling worse and goes around the house to throw up, I help him balance, pat his back and help him sit down while I fix him a place to sleep.

On our way in he makes a pit stop at the bathroom to throw up some more. Once in bed I couldn't settle down, my heart was racing and I could feel the heartbeat throught my body, I had sensation of warmness in my face and upper body.

He wakes me up at 11 and we talk a bit, I thought I had settled down, once he went home I started cleaning up. 

And now, 22 hours since we smoked, my heart is still racing, I feel nauseous and I have to manually breathe.

I'm thinking it's a panic attack. Feel like shit, slightly afraid of falling asleep aswell."	t5_2rukl	True

Heya saplings! So here's what's gone down since the last time I posted. I peed in a cup for my pre-employment drug screen 24 days after my last smoke. I am not a heavy user by any means, but I'm quite overweight so I was totally paranoid that it would still be in my system. I received a phone call four days after my test saying it was too diluted and that I needed to take it again. I had drank TONS of water beforehand. I was informed that if it came back too dilute twice, it would be considered an automatic positive and I would not be able to be employed there after all. I took my second test 29 days after my last smoke. I received another phone call yesterday, and was told everything was fine! My first day is Monday! 

I just wanted to say a quick thank you to everyone who gave me advice and encouragement on my last post. After I got off the phone yesterday, I literally screamed from happiness! Thank you again! :)"	t5_2rukl	True
1372300269.0	1h5ibv	Had my first good high experience! Want to thank everyone here!	JJTheJetPlane5657	31	6	11	"I've had a complicated history with weed. I had a pleasant first few months, but at some point all I started to have were bad highs. I think I was having panic attacks.. And I've finally started to get over them.

I had given up on it for a little while, but then found my stash and thought about how I didn't want to waste money so.. I should try again. 

One of the things that happens to me is uncomfortable vibrating in ONE bodypart at a time. It'd tingle/feel like I twitched for a few minutes, then it'd move to somewhere else and do the same thing. 

I was smoking with my girlfriend (she was sober, just snuggling with me while I smoked) and I started to get that feeling again. She knows about what happens to me, and she feels bad. So she kisses the spot I was complaining about, and what do you know? It actually felt better. Then she just did that for a couple of minutes, kissing where ever I felt bad (neck, arm, around my lungs, etc.), anddd.. I felt better.

All this stuff bad stuff would start pretty immediately after I smoked until I started to come down, but now I'm half a bowl from yesterday and two good hits (I take hugeee hits out of my waterpipe, even though it could be too much) into today. I wanted to push myself a little more and see if I can handle it, and I'm pretty much fine.

So anyway, I didn't necessarily use any of the tips but knowing there was a supportive community out there kind of made me feel better. But thanks! =D"	t5_2rukl	True

1340471576.0	vhlmn	Am I doing something wrong? I can't get high	wumbooo	27	1	23	"So, I've smoked quite a few times(about ten times), but I honestly don't think I've ever gotten high. 

The first time I smoked I had few hits out of a hand pipe which involved a lot of coughing. I probably screwed up inhaling, so I didn't expect to get high. A few weeks later I took a few hits out of my friend's new bong, but I just got tired and had extremely bad cotton mouth which gave me anxiety since I didn't expect it.
The only time I ever felt something was when I smoked 4 or 5 hits from a bong. Everything was very heavy and I feel like I couldn't talk, but again, I didn't feel any different mentally. At another time, I took a couple hits off of a vaporizer; my eyes did get heavy, but I didn't feel any different. 

This is when I started doing a little research and made sure I was inhaling right. I smoke hookah quite a bit and the occasional cigar/cigarette, so I feel like I inhale right. When using a bong I'd light the weed, inhale for 4 or 5 seconds, remove the slide, inhale the smoke, inhale some fresh air on top of the smoke, hold for a couple seconds, then I would exhale and smoke would come out naturally... So I feel like I'm doing that right. Is it possible I just don't get high, because I feel like it would be extremely obvious if I was high. I've used several means: chillum, hand pipe, bongs(one with a carb and one with a slide), and a vaporizer, but again, nothing. I would love to get my hands on some edibles, but that's not possible right now. I also haven't ever smoked on my own, so I've been thinking of buying my own piece and experimenting. I feel like that might be a waste as I've never truly enjoyed any smoking experience yet. 

Any thoughts?"	t5_2rukl	True

1375827047.0	1jub59	The differences between Sativa and Indica, when it comes to the effects/buzz/high.	scomberscombrus	29	2	8	"I just finished smoking three grams that I bought a couple of weeks ago. According to the grower, it was a 50/50 Sativa/Indica hybrid harvested with 50/50 orange/cloudy trichomes. For 'a wide spectrum high'.

I believe that the highest I've ever been is a [[5]](http://i.imgur.com/AKrdc.png). With that said, I've experienced a lot of different effects, and I'm wondering if any of these effects are specific to the Sativa or the Indica buzz. I'll try to put the effects in the order I've felt them hit me.

* A sensation of pressure around the temples, coupled with a heaviness around the eyes.
* Dry mouth. Enhanced sense of touch. Riding a bicycle in sunny weather feels absolutely fantastic at this stage; The air becomes thicker, and you can feel it everywhere on your body. It's easier to *feel* the movement of the chain on the bicycle, if that makes any sense.
* 'Floaty' vision. Easy to look at everything at once, or to focus on the tiniest of details. Blinking with the eyes while moving fast can cause a feeling of *I'm not getting anywhere*.
* Thoughts begin to arise differently than usual. Increased chance/risk of getting stuck in smaller loops of thought. Minor changes in time perception.
* Tingling sensation in the chest area. I first mistook it as my heart beating insanely fast, but it wasn't/isn't. It's more like butterflies in your chest. Wonderful when you get used to it.
* Minor rush of euphoria coupled with a warming and intensification of colours. Music sounds/feels great. Writing feels amazing, one cares for each written letter as one would care for a smaller work of art.
* Small vibrations/pulses in parts of legs. It's almost as if I can feel the blood going through certain places of my body. At least that's what I imagine.

Then the buzz sort of wears off. Meanwhile, the bed feels wonderful.

I've heard about the *body high/buzz* of Indica, and *head high/buzz* of Sativa, but is it black and white like that?

Let me describe my primary smoking set up at home first.

I smoke outback on my patio surrounded on three sides by exterior walls of my house. It isn't closed in though (no roof/fourth wall). I also have a 7ft fence around my back yard. And to top it off my entire property is lined with huge evergreen trees. There is probably about 15-20ft between my back yard and my neighbor's yards. 

with that being said... do you think they can smell my smoke? Would the wind make the smell travel faster or dissolve it? 

After I finish smoking (others i assume as well) it is kinda hard to smell anything else other than burnt trees. But when I'm smoking outside during the day and I hear my neighbors in the next yard and I hope that they don't smell me and get me into some shit, however, this isn't enough to stop me from doing it....

I partook a little but not often and stopped about 6 years ago.

I've been collecting small bits of gear for years (small glass pipe, screens, cheap grinder) and recently moved into my own place so I decided to start up again, just to chill out, much the same way I treat having a drink at home. 

Anyway, made my first-ever 'deal' (for myself anyway), loaded up my first-ever bowl for myself (wasn't sure if I did it right), and blew the smoke out the loft window (to hopefully disipate it enough)...niiiice :) turns out the bowl was loaded just fine, although I need to work on the grinding. My old housemates don't use grinders so I'm not familiar with them, everything else went better than expected :) 

I only watched one movie last night and I could feel the trees starting to kick in from time to time :) but I'm going to have to check out some video games, listen to music, etc. and EAT FOOD OMG can't wait 

The cheap single-layer (2 piece?) grinder (cast metal) I got in Amsterdam is touristy junk, I just ordered a Sharpstone :) I'll be getting a MFLB soon just to be more efficient with the trees, I don't want to mix tobacco in. At some point I'll try growing a couple of plants as well, just to see how it goes.

I only use on off-school days, and I've used it maybe around 20-30 times in the past three or four months, generally done on weekends. I want to know if I should further decrease my consumption. I know that it would be optimal to quit completely, but frankly I really love the way it helps me appreciate my own mind and the world around me.

On the surface, they both appear to be quite similar; combining water and a variety of percs to achieve the desired effects. One obvious difference stuck out; bubblers rarely stood taller than a foot while bongs tend to skew higher, in some excessive cases bigger than a full grown human.

Thoughts on this??

Edit: I really appreciate everyones input on this. So far, it seems divided between ""Yes, it helps"" to ""yes, it helps, but please seek medical attention"". I tend to agree with the latter.

I was wondering what the general opinion on ""underage"" smoking was around here.


IMO there are quite a few risks related to doing so and I do not really think that it is worth it.

* ""Young and Dumb"" is a saying for a reason. I would say that teenagers, with an increased peer preasure factor are more likely to get cought one way or another. possibly ruining their lives dependant on where they are and how severe it is
* Your Body and Mind is still heavily developing during this time, there is a reason why even ""legal drugs"" have an age limit! Overuse of any Drug in that time has a chance (!) of causing severe issues for that teenager. Even if it's just the good ol' stoner stereotype: Sits on couch and does nothing, drops out of school. (My own brother was an example of this, started smoking when 14 and dropped from the highest tier of education in germany to barely finishing the lowest tier within 4 years)
* Availability: While it might not be the case all the time, let's face it, in states/countries where Cannabis has not been decriminalised, the people selling it aren't always the good guy next door.
* and the entire medical side of things. How can you claim that Cannabis is a medicine when 15 year old teenagers are lying stoned on their couch?

I've answered a lot of questions about the topic on here before, but I just wanted to pose this thread as sort of a forum for any lingering questions you all might have, or if you're just curious about vaporizing versus smoking in general. For me and my life, it works better than smoking and provides a cleaner, more focused experience. I use a VaporBros connected to a bong, as well as an MFLB. To be clear - I don't think vaporizing is ""better"" than smoking, and there are many arguments for why one would choose either. I do smoke from time to time, but find my experience with the vaporizer to be better for me.

So hit me with any questions you've got about vaporizers, vaporizing in general, or random questions about space.

1309544446.0	ieelt	PVC pipes don't make good pipes! 	KittyKatBbyCake	26	1	13	"Hello Ents and saplings alike. Just a little information/reminder. When in the position of wanting to smoke but having nothing to smoke out of, many people turn to making their own devices. Some people use bottles, cans, trombone mouthpieces, ect. And then there are the people who decide to use PVC pipes. 

PVC pipes are one of the easiest things to make a working apparatus out of...however, this does NOT mean you should do it. And I'm posting this specifically to inform you not to! PVC is highly toxic when heated, it creates noxious fumes that WILL KILL YOU. Putting a metal piece on it (for the trees) will not make it safe. The flame from the bud can heat the pipe and mix dangerous gasses in with your not so dangerous smoke. 

Please, please, please, take my advice and stay away from PVC pipes when making your own piece. You can find many other 'blueprints' for other MUCH safer devices. The safest thing you can do is to just save some cash and buy some glass. 

Be careful friends, I don't want any of you dieing."	t5_2rukl	True

I was at a going away party for one of my friends, and I have a friend who has some brownies. He gives one to another friend, who in turn gives it to a female friend of his and she eats 3/4 of it. As soon as it hit, she was TERRIFIED of being at the party. People were taking pictures and every time a flash went of she flinched and she started freaking out about it begging someone to take her home. I immediately realized what was going on so I took her to the bus stop so I could get her home. On the way she repeatedly asked me to stay between her and the road as she felt she would fall into it. Her perception of time was EXTREMELY off (two minute walk to bus stop was a few hours, as was waiting for the bus) as well as she felt like her body was melting. I got her home safe, made sure she was ok, and told her to drink some water and sleep. She was fine in the morning and I was so glad because I felt so terrible for her, she had such a bad time :( 

So, moral of the story:  **DO NOT GIVE BROWNIES TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T SMOKE WITHOUT SUPERVISING THEM/MAKING SURE THEY DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH**. Especially when you know the brownies knock YOU on your ass and you smoke everyday. 

Please, if you are going to give someone who doesn't smoke a brownie, make sure they only eat a bit, and prepare them for what they will feel.

1332026605.0	r1d7c	Just a very brief guide to bud.	will118	27	2	9	"**Disclaimer: There are loads of things like trich colour that I'm just not going to bother with. This is gunna be like 4 points**

**For when you're buying bud:**

1. Dense bud, as a grower its all about getting those calyxes pumped full of cannabinoids nice and big. Calyxes are bud. You want dense bud not airy bud.

2. Dry/cured bud. Damp bud absolute **no**. You want it dry but not crispy where it falls apart in your hands. Usually if the bud is dried too fast it can be crispy on the outsides but danker towards the middle.

3. Trichomes/Sugar/Resin on the bud. Like all my points is contentious - but trying to be helpful for *most of the time.* Things like kush have massive calyxes but could have less visible sugar on the buds surface - but **as a rule** if its covered then you're set. Conversely if its not and is a bit airy I'd say thats poorly grown and not worth your money.

4. Strain names. OK well just ignore them - not because they could be lying or misinformed but because its entirely about the end product. Seed companies (won't name any names) have been pumping out crosses like ""Super Cheese Purple Hindu Kushberry Haze"". Anyway, find great bud and then enjoy the ridiculous name, I know I do.

-----------------

5. Trim/Manicure. The little leaves on the bud are called sugar leaves, they do have cannabinoids like THC and get you high, but if you're buying by weight it doesn't get better than pure trimmed bud. 

6. Smell, damp bud doesn't smell great it smells damp. Great bud smells stiiinky, lots of flavours. **Cheesy** smells will be Cheese related strains that will give you a stoney high. **Skunky** smells, a bit like a fruity stench are a bit more buzzy but still stoney. Lemony smells you might expect to be a bit more buzzy and heady, I'm less confident about this but its very largely true.

And the purple thing, well some growers know if they cool down nighttime temperatures or stress the plants in another manner they can turn the leaves on the buds purple. Anyway there are real genetic purples, but again look at the bud quality then relish in the fact purple bud is **awesome**. The different colour alone doesn't make it any better.

**Please feel free to add the other points I've missed or even correct mine, I think I know everything by now but I'm sure I can be shamed.**

1315799239.0	kcpg4	I think I had my first [11] experience.	jrh1984	29	6	26	"I've been smoking trees occasionally for the past year and probably once a week the last month or two. And up until Friday night, I had never really gone past an [8] or even gone back for a second hit once I was high.  

Typically, I blaze up and then settle down with a space doco by myself or play a nostalgic movie or cartoon with friends. The amount usually varies between a joint and a couple of bowls. That's it, I never go back for more once I'm high. However, this time I decided I wanted to smoke more than I normally do, plus go back for more. I wanted to get higher than I ever had before. 

But something went incredibly wrong.

I blazed a really full bowl in my glass pipe. I felt amazing. I could have settled down for the night but I really wanted to experience a higher high. I had a five minute break and drunk some water. 

Then I fired up my bong. One massive load, packed nice and tight. I blazed for what felt like hours. I was really high by this point. I'm not sure if I'm a pussy or not but usually I get a little inner monologue going by this stage which is tells me, ""that's enough jrh1984"". But I wanted to keep going. 

So I packed the same stinky payload in the bong again. Making the grand total three large bowls. 

By this time I was higher than I had ever been before. I sat in my bathroom, on the toilet to be precise, and gently rocked backward and forwards. Almost as if to regain control, although the rocking felt involuntary. I decided I needed to move spots. I got up off the toilet (lid closed - btw) and walked into our bedroom. I flopped on the bed, and got under the covers. I felt horrible. 

The sensation is usually somewhat consistent for me, this was not something I was expecting. I couldn't think. I tried to grapple for some Sagan-esque truth or Feynman-inspired quirk of reality to feed my brain. But it was not going to happen. 

It was almost as if my brain no longer had any conscious function. I was only reactive. My biggest tasks at hand were breathing, heart beating, and existing. I felt I needed to stay ""with it"" to keep being alive, as if I could slip away and die if I wasn't careful. I don't know if I could honestly say I was going to die or not. But I knew I had to ""be careful""; this phrase kept echoing in my mind. Does anyone else get inner ""mantras"" stuck on repeat? 

My whole body was humming. Like I was holding up a seashell, not to my ear, but to my existence. As though Tesla was performing electromagnetic experiments on me from the past. The sound was coming from everywhere and was unbearably loud. 

I was laying flat in bed, yet I felt as though I was performing somersaults. At one stage I caught myself gasping for air. I don't know how long it had been going on for, or whether or not I'd been holding my breath until then. But I gasped. Then immediately thew up. I vomited off the side of the bed onto the floor. Of all the experiences that weed enhances, showering high, eating high, listening to music high; this one takes the cake. This vomit felt like a stream of my insides had been sucked into the mouth of a dementor. 

The worst part was what I think was a ""death of the ego"". I felt physically separate from myself. I didn't see myself from above or any thing crazy like that, but I felt like me and myself were fundamentally different. The internal mantra my brain kept chanting switched, at some stage, to ""you are just a concept"". I was happy my intellect had resurfaced but I couldn't shake this notion. As a collection of atoms, forming various chemical combinations, shaped into various organelles deep inside cells, each with separate duties, forming different organs, all part of different bodily systems: all aiming to construct ""me"". Yet I was an idle, if indifferent, ""bystander"". I was just a concept. The very notion of my ""favourite color"" or ""my siblings"" etc seemed to be absolutely ludicrous. I was just a concept. I identify as jrh1984 - to appease my own subconscious need for ""identity"".     

So. Lesson learned:

I like white owl cigarillos, dutch masters are good, game, etc. Get a notebook or whatever to roll weed on and a knife, a lighter, your weed, and a chopstick or whatever to pack. Lick one side of the blunt very wet till its kinda floppy; take a knife and carefully slice the blunt open where you licked it. make sure you don't tear the blunt up just make like a clean incision, just a straight line. dump all the tobacco out and get like a gram of grinded weed. Sprinkle it where the tobacco was till you have a solid line of weed. lick the entire blunt so its not stiff and fold one side in, underneath the other side so its nice and tight. tuck the other side on top, slowly, piece by piece. take your time and be gentle. once you are done lick the gar up and down so its cemented shut and take your lighter and slowly heat up the cigar to dry it off and make the paper brittle. pack it up with extra weed so its real tight, put it in ya mouth, and light it up! Blunts are a lot of fun and get you high as hell, and are good for social smoking and impressing potential sexual partners. 	t5_2rukl	True

I just want to say thanks for helping me get to where I am today. Here's a toke to you, frient. 

[4]

Edit: Because some were asking about how I located said dealer, I'll share! 

It wasn't too complicated at all. I was with a good friend of mine who I occasionally smoke with, and I mentioned to him that I would really like to start getting my own supply so that I could control when I smoked, and also because I wanted to pitch in during some smoke sessions. He happily agreed, and said that he could contact his dealer. 

At this point I immediately asked him to make sure with his dealer that it was okay that I texted him. When it was confirmed that everything was cool, my friend gave me his contact information. After building up some courage, I texted this wonderful man, and let him know that my friend had referred me to him. 

From there it was all business. Very straightforward and professional, he asked me how much I was looking for, what his prices were, and what strains he had available at the time. We eventually met later that night across from his apartment building and made the deal. 

So now here I am, with an eighth of Blueberry Headband for $60 (in Chicago), and good dealer!

SoFarYetSoClose	32	9	23	So I have been a smoker for about 6 months and I am currently a freshman in high school, (was pressured into smoking and kept doing it) Anyway I had a friend come over to my apartment yesterday with another friend of his and we had a sesh. They brought about 4-5 grams of some medical grade cannabis and somehow forgot to bring a grinder. I have had my grinder for about 5 and a half months (I have probally grinded up close to an ounce) and up until now never really noticed that there was a 4th capsule at the bottom that you have to unscrew to get to. Now before you ask how I didn't notice, the part on the bottom is VERY VERY small and (I'm talking maybe to US quarter widths)  the screen on top is VERY well made and it is also so tight I never figured some stuff can fall threw it, as well as why the 3rd part of the grinder was so lengthy compared to the new found 4th chamber. Anyway my friend went to use the restroom and his friend began to talk up a conversation while grinding up his weed. When he was finished I began to see him start to unscrew the bottom  and I see mounds of this powdery looking stuff fall  out of it. I looked at his face and he looked really surprised yet he still scooped all of it up and threw it into his jar with all the rest of the weed. I know I probably should have asked what  exactly he just took but I was already stuck from a couple depression pills I have took just a couple hours before. Anyway we smoke and my closer friend gets super zoned out and unresponsive so I figure why not ask his buddy what exactly he took. Well he didn't really give me an answer and decided it was his time to leave and he would be back for my friend later tonight. So I am wondering what the hell just happened? 	t5_2rukl	True

I only recently started toking daily, but those who I smoked with before got some real chronic. I was somewhat disappointed before with my weed because it didn't have the same high quality as my frients got from their dealers. This last time I went for a pick up though, my dealer's bf had to sell to me instead since she was at work. He asked what I wanted, and I said twenty, but then changed my mind and went for a forty. He then picked up one bag, smelled it, but then changed his mind or something and reached for another bag to give me instead. I also got smoked out by my dealer for the first time that day. I LOVE the weed I got! The crystals on it, the fruity smell and taste, the density... Its great. 

Reddit, how can I make sure I get this good of weed in the future? I'm not sure if he gave me the better stuff because it was her bf and not her, because I got a forty instead of a twenty and they like selling in higher amounts, or just because they have better stuff than usual..?

Over the years I have hidden my stash in many different places. Some spots I have found to be better than others. 

My first spot was under my office desk in my bedroom at home. There was a little place where I could slide my pipe and weed in.
Pros: Out of sight, Most people wouldn't choose to look there
Cons: Dusty, crammed space, nothing to keep in the smell.

Second spot was in a desk drawer.
Pros: Easy access, masked smell
Cons: Extremely easy to find, every time you opened it the smell would come out, cluttered.

Third spot: In a metal box on my dresser
Pros: Out of sight, good smell proofing
Cons: Out in plain sight, Easy to find if you snooped a little

Fourth and best spot: Behind a dresser drawer. Most dressers have drawers that can  come out of the dresser to make them easier to move from place to place. I removed one of my drawers while cleaning and found out that there was a large enough open space in the back of the dresser to fit my stash perfectly.
Pros: Incredibly hard to find, Smell proof, easy access, plenty of space   considering I can do this with multiple drawers, none of my friends thought of it before me.
Cons: When I'm a bit too high it can be hard to put back.

1356653637.0	15jngb	How to make a simple weed cake! (xpost from r/trees)	BOOGERS_IN_MY_RECTUM	31	7	16	"I got the idea for this cake from [here] (http://kirbiecravings.com/2012/03/2-ingredient-flourless-nutella-cake.html) and the idea of fire crackers.  

So the only ingredients you will need are:

Nutella

4 Eggs

and weed

What you need to do is first take about 4 ounces of nutella (about a third of the [typical nutella jar](http://siouxsielaw.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/nutella.jpg)).  Mix in 2-4 grams of weed (depending on the strength you want your cake to have).  Mix the two things in a bowl until they are blended well.  Now, at this point, you could let the mix sit for about three hours, and it would gain strength marginally, or you could just go ahead and make the cake.  Once again, it just depends on how strong you want your cake.

So once you have the pot nutella, grease a 6 or 7 inch springform pan and preheat the oven to 350.  Beat eggs very well (so they are triple their original volume)  Then mix in about a third of the egg mixture nd gently mix it with the nutella, stirring it clockwise until there are no visible streaks.  Then pour another third and do the same thing, and again until all the egg is mixed.

Then pour the batter in your pan, and bake for 20-25 minutes-until knife comes out clean.  Let cake cool, and then enjoy.  Takes about an hour and thirty minutes to take effect, I advise against eating more than a quarter of the cake at a time.

NOTE: If you want to make this snack even more potent, when you are mixing the pot with nutella, add maybe half a tablespoon of butter.  This adds saturated fat for the pot to bond with."	t5_2rukl	True

I smoke just about every day. The only days I don't is when I don't have time to. If I'm getting home and have nothing that needs my attention I will smoke until I pass out. This is generally due to anxiety and stress that I've been feeling after coming out of a serious relationship. Weed replaced alcohol for me.

I've started smoking with other people more often recently and I find that I seem to feel quite a bit higher sooner than everyone else seems to act. This just causes me more anxiety and is the reason I smoke alone most of the time.

I feel like I'm far less tolerant than most people. I felt like that during my last relationship too when I smoked with my stoner girlfriend. I've tried smoking in large volumes but my tolerance doesn't seem to increase when I'm smoking socially.

I've heard that some people are just overly sensitive to marijuana and I am wondering if I'm one of those people, or if my anxiety is causing me to feel unnaturally high.

The biggest problem I have is I become overly concious about the way I act and the things I say when I'm high. I feel like my insecurities are increased when I'm not in complete control. I also tend to make comments about being high and feel like I'm coming across as someone who just started smoking weed (I started in 2009).

As it stands, I'm required to chose between two highly valuable options. On the one hand, there is the good herb. I've been smoking mids for quite a while; this seems like a good time to upgrade my stash with some higher end product. I still have over an 1/8th, so not picking up anytime soon will not leave me dry.

On the other hand, there is the pieces/glassware. I've got a quality spoon and a mini bong which have been doing the job for a while, but  I'm sure there's something better out there. Currently, the debate is between a larger, higher quality bong or the MFLB. As it stands, my current pieces still work and I would have no quandary continuing to use them.

saplings has given me good advice in the past, I'm sure you can help me out. If you vote that I should invest in better herb, what strains would you vouch for? If you think better equipment would be a wiser choice, what sort of pieces have you used that deserve a good recommendation?

Update: Have been getting a very strong argument for MFLBs and I almost went that route, were it not for an unanticipated element introduced late in the game. As it just so happens, my regular dealer just got white widow in the day before. Needless to say that decision pretty much made itself.

1344055494.0	xnps7	Terrible high, felt like I literally experienced death	shittoohigh	25	5	16	"Allow me to explain. I've been smoking trees the last couple of weeks. About once or twice a week. Haven't gotten incredibly high, but I've been smoking out of a bowl which is what I've used whenever I toke.  
So the other night I hit a gravity bong at a friends house. I've never had such an intense hit and immediately felt nauseous seconds after the hit. A couple more seconds and everything got very slow, as if my vision framerate was slowly decreasing. I told my friends I was going to pass out, not knowing what the hell was going on, and stumbled to the couch. Next thing I remember is hearing my friend yelling at me to wake up. 
At this point though I had lost sense of reality. It was almost an out of body experience, and I remember assuming that I about to die. Everything went numb, I could barely talk, and I kept telling my friend I was about to die. He persisted in trying to get me to snap out of it, but eventually I just couldn't react anymore. I thought to myself ""I'm dead. This is it. "" I was not in this world anymore, but in limbo between life and death. Everything was gone, but I could hear everything. My friend begging me to wake up, the others trying to help. Everything was no longer there, I felt like death had finally come.  I just wanted to pass on to the other side, but couldn't get the sound of reality to stop. I knew I was about to die, and I was content in going through it. I heard my friend's screams, felt him slap my face a few times. But the feelings were weak I felt like I was no longer trapped in my body. I began to cycle through events in my life, etc. Eventaully I could open my eyes and mumble a few words gasping for breath. After realizing I wasn't going to die, I was determined that I had a heart attack. I begged for an ambulance, I just anted help before it got worse. Eventaully reality set back in, and within 2 hours I was able to drive home. 


I have no idea why this happened to me and no one else. After doing a bit of research, Im pretty sure it was an anxiety attack  But I've never had a history of anxiety or panic, so I haven't a clue as to why this happened. I really wish it didn't, because it's been two days and my head still slightly hurts and I feel nautious whenever I eat. I feel I'm recovering, but very slowly. 

Obviously, all of this was in my head. My friends assure I never stopped breathing nor did my heart stop. I've read up on other similar cases and most point to an anxiety attack. 


Additional info: Not taking any meds, no past mental problems, First time I toked was about two years ago. 


Basically, I just have a couple questions: Have any of you gone though this? Why might this have happened(besides the fact that it was a shit ton of good weed)? Anyone have experience recovering?


Any advice would really be appreciated. I really want to move on, hopefully continue to toke without worry(with a bowl of course). "	t5_2rukl	True

The only problem is that I have literally a shit ton of stuff in my garage ranging from office supplies to blankets to bikes and hardware, but that's a whole different story.

Last week I was visiting him and I noticed that the friend (Call him Bob) was taking the pot and smoking regularly, a couple times a day. Bob is someone who I've had problems with in the past (which is why I'm not sure if my judgement is clouded or if he is being a douche). He's one of those guys who thinks he is a hippie because he smokes pot. He's an asshole sometimes but can also be really cool. 
My fiancé has been buying all of the weed for the two of them. All of it. Bob doesn't ever throw in for their combined stash. During my visit, I probably smoked out of 12 bowls, (I'm a serious lightweight so I'm talking like 2 small hits out of each bowl) but there was enough purchased for at least 30 bowls. By the time the visit was over, the pot was gone. So Bob had ~15 bowls to himself of weed he didn't pay for. 
Apparently, this has been happening between my fiancé and Bob for the last year. Bob even said he hasn't paid for pot in a year because my fiancé was buying it! My fiancé is mad about the fact that Bob never ever throws in and is about ready to stop buying any weed to prevent wasting money. 
So my question is, is this okay for Bob to be doing? Am I clouded by my dislike and distrust of Bob and its okay? Or is Bob actually stealing weed? If he is, how could he be approached about his actions in a way that wouldn't leave my fiancé without a place to live? Thanks. "	t5_2rukl	True

1340699925.0	vmdfk	A sapling's revelation.	CHooTZ	24	2	9	"Hello, I've been smoking for a couple months, and pretty consistently at that. I generally go through about .5g a day on weekends, maybe half that for a weekday, so I've been smoking significantly.

I will usually smoke one of two ways; through my bong filled with normal water, or through my glass spoon pipe, Terra. I like Terra because it's pretty hard to get overwhelmed with the pipe, as you can just pull away and not waste much. On the other hand, I really enjoy the bong as it's a cleaner hit, with the water filtering it, it's a little cooler, and I feel like I get higher or more bang-for-my-buck on the bong. Unfortunately, if I accidentally get a big cherry on the bong, it can easily over-whelm me and lead to me coughing, or wasting some of the smoke.

This leaves me at today, where on a spur-of the-moment type thing, I put about 4 ice cubes (each chopped in two to fit in my mouthpiece) in my bong before filling it with cold water. I proceeded to light up, and on my first bowl the difference was *immediately* obvious. The smoke was waaaay cooler and much easier to manage. With this smoke I didn't have to limit myself due to heat, leading to my main restriction now being how much I can fit in my lungs, now how hot my throat is. I was no longer afraid to milk a good cherry as I didn't have to cap myself nearly as badly. Due to me not having to stop midway through cherries, I could use up all of them, and this was a much faster process as I didn't have to keep pausing.

In the end, I'm definitely going to keep smoking in this manner, it's faster, more relaxing, less harsh and way easier. My spoon will still have its use as a portable option, but never am I going to chose to smoke though room-temp water again.

**TLDR:** 
Decided to try ice in my bong's water. The experience was *much* better, it was faster, more relaxing, less harsh and way easier. Definitely give it a try.

In both situations a group of me and 5 others were sharing 2 joints, I took deep breaths in, felt my chest expand and held for 5 seconds after passing. I didn't get high either time.

Fast forward to this week, I pick up my first weed and use a small twister pipe to smoke it, no carb. I do this 3 times over the past 4 days, putting maybe like ~0.3g into the bowl and taking like 4 big hits and maybe a couple smaller ones. I inhale into my lungs, hold for 5 seconds and exhale, knowing I have reached my lungs since the smoke is normally pretty much gone. The first time, I felt my face become 'heavy'(?), like my whole face just felt like it was being weighted down. Also felt a kind of 'buzz' but no enjoyable sensations really. Second day, I smoked and whilst walking around, my balance was totally gone and one of the worst parts was carrying food upstairs and when I put a leg down, it would shake a little as I put weight on it, took like 3 minutes to climb 16 stairs.

Then.. I smoked earlier today, suddenly I felt my brain become 'heavy', and there was an **extremely** unpleasant clicking sound in the back of my brain which synchronised with my heartbeat and occurred maybe once or twice every 20 seconds. The clicking noise and sensation was horrible, I was flinching every time it happened and my senses were on edge. I was hearing noises downstairs (me being the only one in) and was kind of paranoid that someone was in. I read online about the crunching sound and pretty much every symptom was terrible. It was like, cancer, heart problems, blood clots, schizophrenia. Now reading schizophrenia scared me a good bit, and I was panicking like mad hoping I hadn't damaged my mental health.

I decided to go for a nap thanks to [Nujabes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yYMicbSf98&amp;feature=related) and woke up 2 hours later, with the effects totally gone.

Now, I still have some weed left and might try tomorrow, but I'm honestly just wondering if there is something messed up with either this weed or me that is stopping me getting high. Please help guys, what is wrong?"	t5_2rukl	True

So... my life kinda sucks lately. From stress at work, to stress in school, to my awesome ability to be anxious in any social setting, I end up being unhappy a lot. So, I've decided that I might need some help.

Here's where you come in; I'm 21, and I've never done... well... anything. The hardest thing I've ever taken is Advil. However, after hearing all of these stories about the amazing relaxation to be had here, I thought I'd give it a try. So, I was wondering... what do I need to know? What should I look for, what should I avoid? Are there any tips for a first-time? Just some general guidelines maybe? Any information would be appreciated!

1362459566.0	19otxv	New ent here, trying to make sure I'm doing it right.		23	1	18	"Sorry for the long post. Just jotting down my internal dialogue.

I actually just made my second purchase and want to check how I'm doing. I'll be as specific as possible so I can see what I am doing wrong. It may seem obvious but I've only smoked a couple times with friends and they never really gave any advice other than ""hold it in.""

I bought a quarter the other day. I don't have a scale but it's a huge dense nug and smells very strongly of skunk. It's dark green with some orange streaks and kind of dim, tiny white crystals over it. From what I read, it seems to classify as a decent mid. Only thing that annoys me it that it has a big-ass stem.

(I don't have any pictures because I don't like messing with weed while everyone else is awake)

So, the way I smoke is I have a small glass pipe, and I kind of break off a piece of the nug and then crush and tear it inside of the plastic baggie until it's decently mashed into small, fine pieces. 

This is where I think I am going wrong: After that, I pack it kind of tightly into the pipe. Then I use my lighter at kind of a slant which lights most of the bowl and inhale to suck the flame into the bowl. Once it lights, I turn off the lighter and inhale. I usually take big hits and hold my breath until either I need air or I start coughing. I do this in fairly rapid succession.

Often times, I find that the kindling dies out almost immediately after inhaling, and I feel like I am just turning my weed into charcoal or something. The top of the stuff in the pipe is coated with black, burnt matter (is that the resin?) and I find that the middle and bottom of the weed is pretty much intact. 

Anyway, after I'm done burning my weed like an idiot, I sit back and wait for it to kick in. 

I don't really know what being stoned is *supposed* to feel like. My high consists of feeling like my face has a muscle relaxant, and everything is pulled upwards, like my cheeks and eyelids. It makes me have a huge grin. It also feels like my brain is kind of... buzzing? It's a bit of a weird sensation. Mostly, it just feels like my head is floating. Also, my eyes get red, but that is probably obvious.  My blood pressure seems to get a little bit higher. Not alarmingly so, but noticeably. 

These feelings are cool, and I enjoy it, but I don't really feel any of the experiences that I see stories about. I mostly kind of sit there and things are funnier and my head is floaty, but only if I'm sitting there kind of concentrating on the high. If I don't do that and I move around, I feel mostly normal and am able to focus on tasks, but kinda zoned out.

What is the difference between my experience (zoned out, relaxed, floaty-head/giggly) and getting totally blazed?

When I'm outside on those cold and bitter nights to smoke a bowl, I wonder if smoking can actually cause me to be warmer...or colder?

1341077068.0	vuilo	May have smoked a little bit of moldy weed, now I'm really scared I might get sick	ohgodmold	28	7	15	"Okay so...

I just started smoking about month ago. First time I bought dealer gave it to me in a plastic bag that was inside a glass jar. He let me borrow the jar for 12 hours and then I had to figure it out on my own. I kept it in tupperware for a few weeks then transfered it to an orange prescription bottle which i continued to keep inside tupperware. All the time the tupperware was in a drawer.

A couple days ago I got a grinder but didn't have time to really smoke so I stupidly just grinded some weed and left it there for almost a week now. I packed a bowl today and smoked like half of it before I suddenly remembered reading about ""whiteys"" and moldy weed. I looked at my remaining bowl, and after carefully scrutinizing it, decided that the tiny white bits I could see if I looked really close were mold and that I was totally screwed. I dumped the rest out along with the record of the stuff that was in my grinder. I'm going to throw it out as soon as I get the chance. 

I'm thinking about throwing away the rest because it was in that little plastic bag so long. However, putting my nose up to the bottle still smells a lot like weed (didn't get to smell test the bowl and grinder weed before dumping). 

I'm definitely investing in a tight glass bottle for my new purchase and I plan on buying some 95% rubbing alcohol and soaking everything in it. I can take some pictures but they won't be real high resolution.

Also tips for future storage?

edit: been about an hour and a half now -- my little bit of light headedness has worn off. I thought about it some and I realized that the week before I got my grinder my highs WERE getting a lot lamer and I was getting light headed a lot more during them.

I have an overall pretty low tolerance to weed, just one or half of a bong rip will get me REALLY high, a couple of puffs from a joint will usually do the trick. Either way, when I'm high, regardless of how much I've taken, I start getting really paranoid(too many thoughts in my head, etc), unless I'm doing something to keep my mind running like video games or getting my ""mind blown"" looking at trippy stuff on the internet, or much preferably just walking around outside while listening to music. Doing pretty much anything that isn't indoors is when I truly enjoy a ""high"", like going on a hiking trail when high is close to the best feeling I've ever had. Hell watching a TV show or movie is close to impossible because I can't seem to keep up when my mind is too ""cluttered"" by just sitting there looking at a screen. I don't go around telling everyone how paranoid I am or anything, I may just sit there and make it seem like nothing is going on but obviously I'm not completely comfortable.

Most of my friends that I smoke with like to just lay around and do nothing which is how I start feeling uncomfortable, and smoking alone I'm fine with but I'd really rather not do. So is this normal? or should I just stop smoking altogether if it's gonna make me paranoid when I can't ""just chill""? Perhaps an inner ADHD pops out when I'm high or something, or maybe I'm already going crazy? Any tips on dealing with this problem will be greatly appreciated. "	t5_2rukl	True

I'm in my late 20s and decided to smoke trees for the first time. TLDR reasons aside, I want to make my first time the most enjoyable, relaxing, safe experience I can. I know it's not really a big deal, but I'm quite nervous (in a good way!).
I've got a pipe and a grinder. 
I've got a safe little smoking spot close to home, and a non-smoker boyfriend who is supportive and amazing. 
I've got Coke and Juice in the fridge, some of my favourite tunes loaded on a playlist, and a really comfy beanbag. :)
I've watched a lot of youtube about how to pack a bowl, how to grind, etc
Most importantly, a trusted friend is hooking me up with $150 worth - we are splitting a bigger bag, so I know I won't get terrible/sketchy stuff.

Advice for what to do?
Stupid mistakes you made as noob smokers that I should avoid?
Movies to watch?

Yeah, I know this post looks foolish. I bet I'll be embarrassed to read it later. But my point is that I don't know what I should be feeling right now. I guess I should have researched this better, but oh well, I need to ask more questions. If I smoked too much, what will happen/when will it subside?

TL:DR (wow)
1) I may have smoked too much. 
2) If I did, what happens? When can I expect it to be over?

WALL OF BORING TEXT:
I just want to say in advance that I don't have any affiliation with this guy or his YouTube channel.  But I thought his videos were informative and entertaining, and I wanted to share them.
So the main reason I came to Reddit was because I found /r/trees and later /r/saplings.  You guys are all freakin awesome, and I learned so much about life and I feel so much better about myself thanks to you good folk.
Anyways, before I came to Reddit, I had a lot of questions about cannabis.  I've been smoking for a while but outside of the weed my friends gave me, I didn't know a damn thing about marijuana, how to use various pipes, or cannabis culture.  So I searched a while on Google and YouTube, and the best site I found was Lex's World.  The guy that runs it is really down-to-Earth, methodical, and straightforward.  And his videos answered a ton of questions I had about weed.  Every once in a while, he does videos about other random things, but it's usually stuff that an internet-savvy smoker would be interested in.

Here's some memorable vids:

Hey fellow ents! So I've mentioned to a couple of my best friends who don't smoke, that I respect that they don't want to try it and am glad they don't pressure me to quit. Although, I've also said that ""if you ever change your mind, I'd love to show you the experience.""

I kind of forgot about it, when today my friend was like. ""Bro. Do you have any more stuff? [Stuff?] Yeah, ...green stuff."" [Really? OH YEAH!]

We smoked a respectable amount, enough to get me a little up there, but not too much that he would feel too out of it. Yet, although he seemed to be doing it right, even coughed once, he kept saying he never felt anything. After a few hours when it was dying down for me I asked him if he had felt anything the entire time. ""Nope.""

He said it was a one time thing and that I was to tell no one, so it makes me sad that he may not try it again. Why didn't it work? Do the receptors or whatever have to be activated for some people during the first few times?

After a friend (and dealer) stood me up 3 separate times, I made a post on Craigslist personals. After wading through a few crazies, I found a guy who said he had some OG Kush he was trying to get rid of. Price was quoted at 60/eighth.

He asks for some proof I'm me, I give him my FB profile (all info except my picture and name is locked away) and he says he's comfortable. When I ask for his, he says he doesn't have one. Whatevs, some people don't.

We agree on a price, date, and location to meet up. Somewhere public (an outdoor mall downtown). Once again I ask for proof, he says he's just gonna show me.

Then he calls me (on a GV number easily deleted, or I can just block him) and sounds like an older black male. Doesn't use any obvious terms, but asks me to buy a quarter instead of an eighth. I say maybe, I'll decide once I see the bud.

I'm sorta new to smoking. I started in March/April, and I only smoked once every few months, only getting really stoned once.

A few months ago I went to a party, got shit drunk, and went  to another party the next day. I had a hangover and felt like I was going to throw up all day. At the second day's party (family member's birthday) I smoked like 2 bowls with 3 of my cousins. They called the strain Green Grenade. I was mildly hallucinating. I thought my cousin was black for a bit until I looked at him, I heard people calling my name when they weren't, and I heard someone talking like they were a chipmunk. I had an anxiety attack (not being able to breathe easily, pain in my throat), then the trip ended. They said it wasn't laced.

1349015647.0	10plqg	Did I hit a [10]?	FourPartFox	27	6	30	Last night, I got far higher than I wanted to. Started with the strong need to lay down. Didn't think I could make it to the couch, so I lay on the floor. I then couldn't move. There was tingling in my arms and legs, and then I could no longer feel my fingers. It's like they weren't there. Wanted to move or talk, but couldn't bring myself to. And then, the vertigo. Every time I opened my eyes, the vertigo was really bad. It slowly made me nauseous. Normally, I can resist the feeling of needing to vomit, but I couldn't resist this. Got up, had to retch, then made it to the bathroom. After a round of seeing my dinner again, I tried to get up, and started the whole process over again. Eventually, my boyfrient walked me to bed, helped me lay down, and brought me mint tea. Once I was laying down, I had to keep my eyes closed, as even opening them there was too much, especially if I moved my head, though closing my eyes didn't relieve that feeling. Was this [10], or just [9]?	t5_2rukl	True

I go to this shop pretty often, so I've seen him before and we've had small talk and he's pretty nice and he obviously knows I smoke, so he shows me this bag he got from his new dealer and it looks really really really dank--he said the guy who deals has access to straight medical (we live in Maryland), and that it's some Jamaican guy. He asks if I'd be interested in getting his number, because according to him he was ""trying to help people around here stop smoking that dirt weed', and I wasn't thinking anything bad about the idea at first so I say sure. He gives me the guys number on a piece of paper and tells me to say ""Hi ***** from the tobacco shop told me to talk to you about getting my brakes checked for $60."". I walked out thinking ""Oh shit, cool, I could get some really dank shit"", but as I was walking back home I'm thinking ""Wow, that is really sketchy and could be potentially a cop."", but I'm not sure if I was just being paranoid because I was high or not. Is it worth giving the guy a shot? The tobacco guy approached /me/ about the weed and showed me the weed, which makes me think it isn't a cop or anything, but I'm still not sure. I didn't see anything wrong with the idea at the time but now it seems things could definitely go wrong. But do you guys think I should try this guy, or just trash the number?

absorption rate of edibles?"	evange	19	1	5	"So I made [pills](http://420deku.blogspot.ca/2011/10/how-to-make-thc-pills-aka-canna-caps.html).

I followed the general procedure from the above link, but my amounts were mostly just eyeballed (1/2 an oz of weed + a couple spoonfulls of coconut oil, I assume about 1/4 to 1/3 of a cup).

Anyway, I took two pills on thursday night (on an empty stomach), felt the effects within 30 minutes, and then went on to get very very enjoyably high. 

Fast forward to saturday, I figured I'd have a dinner party where my friends try the pills, then I'd cook dinner. Getting high + tasty food = awesome idea, right? 

Anyway, they have tolerances higher than me, so I recomended taking 2 or 3 to start. We all took pills, and then about 15 minutes later dinner was served (roast beef and yorkshire pudding).

I didn't end up taking a pill until just before I sat down to eat, as I was worried about remaining functional enough to take everything out of the oven on time. 

But then nothing happened. We ate at 6:30, and around midnight when people started leaving most people felt nothing. 

I ended up falling asleep on the couch, and when I woke up I had that groggy/spaced feeling that I *was* stoned, but I dont remember getting there. My assumption is that the pills kicked in after I fell asleep. 

This is anacdotally supported by two other people who took the pills, one of them woke up in the middle of the night and realized they were stoned, the other realized they were stoned when they got up in the morning. 

But then on the other hand, one friend took 5 pills and claims they never kicked in. 

So I'm wondering, does anyone have any experience with how the absorbtion rate of edibles may vary depending on what and when you have eaten regular food?

How much do trees cost(dime = 10, but how much do you get for that)? Is that a gram?

How big does a joint have to be and if you make one and decide you're high enough, can you put it out?

Do I need one of those grinder things?  Cant I just pull it apart with my fingers or something?  

/questions

I'm in highschool and terribly antisocial.  I have maybe 4-5 good friends and I know for a fact that none of them smoke/have ever smoked.  I know a kid, I wouldn't say we're best friends but we talk in class, he's a casual acquaintance.  I guess I wouldn't be sad if he died, but I'd notice that he died.  Anyway, I know without a doubt in my heart that he is in to trees(bongs, pipes, he has that stuff).  How would I go about asking him for some?  Or should I ask who he gets it from?  I'd rather not ask the pizza delivery guy if he has a hook up.  There is a community college a little bit away(10, 15 minutes?) but I don't really want to walk around(being 15-17) looking for people doing drugs.  

Are real life drug dealers as nice as the ones on TV?  They give you a free sample as a prospective customer and hope you return willing to purchase?  That would be sweet.

I'm in the market for a job, and for this job there will without a doubt be a drug test.  I'm still looking for one but I'm sure I'll have it before the end of August.  Should I just wait until after the drug test to start smoking?  

I have lighters and stuff, will those cheapy bic ones you get at a gas station work fine?  

Rolling papers.  On Harold and Kumar he ripped a page out of a phonebook and use it, is that any good?  Or I'm sure there's a bible laying around and I could rip out the blank pages. 

If I manage to get some trees but dont have a job yet, how long will they store?  What do I store it in, a Ziploc bag? 

Lets say I manage to buy some trees after all and now I have them in my possession, got that job I was talking about, and am ready to smoke for the first time.  What exactly do I need to do to the stuff?  I'd prefer to start out and make sure I like this stuff before I buy a pipe or anything so, joints for me?  I'm sure I can google how to roll a joint, but do I need to tear up that shit in to teeny tiny pieces? 

More questionssss:

How long does a high last?

Will I get the munchies?  Seriously though, I hardly ever eat because I never have an appetite, this could be a 
good thing.

Will(Could) trees help me fall asleep easier?  It takes anywhere from one to three hours(or more) of laying in bed doing nothing for me to fall asleep.

I have a vehicle of my own, and if I have trees with me(coming back from buying some or something), where do you suggest I put them?  I guess not the glove box or whatever you call it because, well, I tend to speed a lot and on the off chance I get pulled over and some cop sees in there, bustedddddd.  How about the console thing in the middle?  
Is a pipe really, really worth it? 

Thanks for your helpful answers, Ive seen how nice you guys can be, hopefully I'll be one of you soon enough =)

It was mostly to help me sleep, deal with some anxiety and depression, and of course enjoyment. For a while I gave it up. Somehow it lost some interest and was not as effective as it used to be.

Recently I have been missing it a lot an want to start smoking again. But I have moved along sense then. Now I am a prospective school teacher. I start my student teaching soon and am worried about two things. One, I am fearful that if I am caught I will not be able to pursue my passion. Two, what my friends might think if they discovered their teacher friend was also a smoker. Three, and most importantly, I live in Colorado where medical is legalized. Part of my wanting to start again is I flipped my car at 70mph and now I have chronic pain. I believe I could easily get a licence. But, I am nervous about putting my name on a list and the school somehow finding out. 

I know this sounds paranoid, but help!

TL;DR: I want to start smoking again, but now going to be a teacher. Fearful for career. "	t5_2rukl	True

1306639513.0	hmm76	(xpost from r/trees) TIL that the Paranoia that comes with smoking is nature's way of calling you to become more conscious and aware.	GMRox	22	5	4	"I've been smoking for a couple of years now, and would always feel paranoid and weirdly different when I'm around other people.

Until recently I read Treating Yourself magazine explaining how to use the paranoia as way to connect more to the world and become more conscious and aware of your life as part of nature and not part of this other egotistical world.

I have much more to learn but this has been one of the most life changing experiences I have ever had! I wanted to share this, in hopes of challenging other ents to think more critically when smoking trees!

So next time you feel paranoid, try thinking more in depth and realize that your mind is not who you are but more a tool you use. It is more important how you handle things in life rather than actually neglecting the ""NOW"".

Every time I smoke now, I become more of a conscious thinker and sort of ""reset"" myself back to this conscious mentality whenever I feel like I am losing myself into this ""Ego World"" as I like to call it.

Feel free to discuss, as I would love to keep learning about this important subject and show other ents this other amazing world.

Happy Toking everyone!

Last night I saw Being John Malkovich on Netflix(also on youtube) for the first time and I have to say, it perfectly puts what I am talking about into play. I recommend everyone to watch that movie after reading this, even if you already saw it years ago, watch it again.

1292456521.0	emi41	How to smoke properly/take big hits.	cnbdream	21	3	24	"[Caitthegreat](http://www.reddit.com/user/caitthegreat) and I were talking earlier about how many people don't know how to properly take a hit off of a pipe or joint, so we (or rather, she decided I) are (am) going to outline the steps here.  This is something most cigarette smokers learn very quickly, so as to prevent coughing and having their cigarette taste like trash.

The first thing that really needs to be established is that there are two ways to take a drag off of something.  The first involves inhaling directly through whatever it is you're smoking (this is most commonly properly used in smoking bongs) which alone is generally not how you're ""supposed"" to smoke.  My friends and I call this method of smoking, ""straight inhaling.""  The second involves using your cheeks to pull smoke into your mouth from whatever you're smoking, and then moving whatever it is you're smoking away, and inhaling air on top of the smoke in your mouth (most commonly used alone properly in smoking cigarettes and joints).

When smoking a pipe and attempting to take a big or fast rip, the easiest way is to do some combination of the two.  Generally, what I do is, inhale very slowly, while using my cheeks to pull air, until I can feel thick smoke at the back of my throat.  I let off the carb at that point and inhale air through it to clear the chamber, then take the piece away from my mouth and inhale air.  You can take hits that are two or three times bigger than straight inhaling in half the time, with a fraction of the harshness.

This is something I've found most people naturally do, but I've been amazed to meet some people inhale directly off of whatever they're smoking without taking the smoke into their mouth first.  Unless you're smoking a bong or a big bubbler, it's generally not the best way to enjoy the taste and smoothness of your trees, nor the most efficient way to take a hit.  Everyone talks about cornering the bowl and only touching the lighter to it for a few seconds, but not many touch on the act of actually inhaling the smoke.  Give this a try if you don't already and see how it works for you."	t5_2rukl	True

1365796459.0	1c86jv	Hey Saplings, here are some words of wisdom in the horrible case that you get arrested.	THCTuesdays	20	2	8	"This isn't an avoiding arrest post, but advice for after.  If you are over 18 years of age, don't panic.  Even if you are booked into jail all bail is given back when you go to court (don't use a bondsman), no worries.  The court date? Probably won't be bad, show up in nice clothes and be polite, it works!  Get a lawyer if need be, but you can be fine without one, I have been in the past (in a super strict herb state too!). But remember to stay calm, however much it sucks things work themselves out in the end.  

Probation? Don't smoke spice, find out the testing schedule over a period of two months and figure out how much and how often you can smoke without detection.  Sure the 2 weeks of sobriety followed by a week of smoking will suck, but you still have a week of blazing rather than making your brain hurt with synths.

I've been in the situation a time or two and have had plenty of friends in the same boat.  Recently I saw a friend deal with charges who could have used the advice, ""stay calm, it'll work out"".  He over thought everything and let the arrest ruin his social life.  I would just like to say, don't do that.  It is mentally unhealthy and will make life 3 times less fun (Very rough guesstimate).   So new or old, just be chill after the arrest.  It is over, nothing left to fret about, rather spend time focusing on how to better your chances in court. "	t5_2rukl	True

1355030139.0	14j9ti	Advice for a potential new sapling.	acurioussapling	22	6	20	"Hello there /r/saplings. I am currently considering trying cannabis for the first time. There are just a few questions that I would like to ask.

I'll give some background first. I am eighteen and have unfortunately lived a pretty sheltered life. The interest in cannabis has been there for a long time but I never really pursued when I was younger, which from my understanding is a good thing. The only thing that is really stopping me right now is a lack of connections, anxiety (I suffer from social anxiety that can range from mild to severe,) and an overall lack of knowledge on the subject.

I've done some reading around this and other subreddits and still have a few remaining questions. If these have been covered elsewhere please forgive me, I am pretty much clueless when it comes to this.

1. I have recently become what you could maybe call friends with someone who I know for sure is an ENT. I have brought up my interest and he has told me that he wouldn't mind smoking with me in a safe environment. This was about a month ago however. Should I bring it up again and how should I go about doing so?

2. I wouldn't feel right smoking someone's weed without reimbursing them in some way. Should I give them money or pay them back in another way. (How much should I pay them?)

3. I don't know exactly what I would want to do. Should I have a general idea, count on him having ideas, or will things just kind of happen?

4. From what I have read so far I should stay away from edibles, at least for now. What would be the best way for someone who has never smoked anything?

5. My mother is not what I would call anti-weed but I don't know how she would react to me smoking. If/when I do try it I will be doing it somewhere that isn't my house. Are there any particular precautions I should take to make sure she doesn't find out? 

6. Is there anything I should be aware of for the first time, like things to expect, watch out for, etc.?

7. Say things go well and I smoke a few more times and decide to try to get some for myself. Should I try to make connections through the previously mentioned person?

Again I apologize if this is common knowledge or posted elsewhere but I have no idea what I am doing. I also have a bad habit of overthinking things and maybe I'd be a bit better off if I relaxed more."	t5_2rukl	True

Recently I've started to smoke (vape) every day using my MFLB. I hear that low amounts of cannabis use can reduce depression, although large amounts can increase it. I'm just wondering if other people have used it specifically for the intention of getting rid of their depression, and what techniques were used? Whether smoked a super small amount on a daily basis, a moderate amount every x days, or multiple times a day?

For the last 2 months I have been going through about an eighth every 2-3 weeks. I feel that it's possibly a bit too much, but I've since been working harder in school, been more motivated, and less depressed, but I don't really want to get too far without some outside advice.

Edit: Thanks for all of your advice, especially those of you who didn't jump on the bandwagon of ""Weed is a miracle drug that cures everything"". I'll take seeing a doctor into consideration, but I honestly don't feel like it's necessary, or that my depression is serious enough to need legitimate medical help (I really don't like going to the doctors).

So, a few weeks before moving away to college I tried weed for the first time (Well, not the first time, the first time doesn't count, musical festival, black out drunk, american weed) and honestly it was a splendid experience. A friend invited me and a couple other friends to go smoke with him. We used a bong and I only needed two hits to get going. I swear, being in the car (Sober driver) felt like a roller coaster. We then got home and just gamed and stuff, honestly I don't really remember most of the night other than that it was a great night and allowed me to just be more, me.

There's a local restaurant/rest stop thing within a minute from my house, and it was closed today, so I figured I could just pull in, tear open the plastic bag, and put everything inside. So I went into a spot, didn't even park, and started transferring the nugs. I can't have been there for more than a minute when someone who I assume to be the owner walked up and tapped on my window, looking pretty angry, and asking ""Can I help you?""

I panicked, said ""No."", and threw it into reverse and pulled out. But I'm pretty damn sure I heard him say ""Whatever, I got your license plate number!"" and then he threw his arms up. He looked pretty fucking pissed. I almost think he saw me coming or something? I had JUST pulled in, and the spot was a bit away from the entrance and on the opposite side of the building.

1341845480.0	w9sw5	A Question about Grinding	severn	20	3	28	"Hello Saplings and Ents! I got blazed last night with a friend of mine with some dank ass shit. It was glorious and only my second or third time smoking, ever. Here's my questions:

We smoked 2 bowls, we shared the first one, and the second one was all mine because apparently it takes more for me to get high. On the first bowl, he broke up the bud by hand (we didn't have a grinder) and got it into really small pieces. We were able to get about 4 hits off that bowl without much problem.

On the second bowl, I broke it up and admittedly did a poor job of it. That being said, I've taken 4 hits off of it, and there is still enough for another 2 hits AT LEAST (which I plan to enjoy after work today).

If you get more hits off of a less ground bud, why does everyone grind it?"	t5_2rukl	True

It was the first time that I've ever smoked this much and it took a few minutes to hit me, but when it did, I was surprised that I could still function.

Me and my friends all started walking to the nearest supermarket for munchies. Then, all of a sudden, my vision went yellow and I had this constant ringing in my ears which made it very difficult to hear my friends. Then, my vision went pale and white-ish.

I was nervous at first, but then I started enjoying it.

I have a few friends I toke with, but I'm more or less reliant on them.

My problem is that all of the people I know who smoke aren't really my type.  I don't fall into the stoner stereotype at all, and most of the people who aren't the lazy stoner type are conceited or just not generally pleasing to be around.  I don't want to change my friend group to incorporate a habit, and I don't want my morals to be changed.  What I'm asking now is this: is it better to wait until college to find smoking buddies, or should I smoke alone now?  I could try getting some of my real friends to smoke, but most of them are not tree friendly although some drink.  I also don't want to be known as that kid who gets high by himself, so there's that too.  Truthfully, I'm lost and looking toward you guys to help.

Edit: Also, I forgot to say that I've already smoked a few times--once alone, once at a concert, and once with a friend whom I don't have much in common with.

Update: Thanks for all of the great answers, guys.  I think what I will do is occasionally smoke alone this summer, and if someone comes along that is really awesome, I may start smoking with them.  Otherwise, I'll just enjoy my down time.  I'll definitely keep my priorities straight during the school year and will smoke less often (if at all).

I mean, sure, when I get home from work and not smoke I'm more active. But at this point, I've cleaned the shit out of the house. I'm on top of that laundry, car maintenance, house chores, etc. But man, I'm finding myself just plain bored.  Video games only hold my attention for so long. I've seen every Neil Degrasse Tyson video. I'm seeking out new hobbies left and right. 

So, like, is this normal? Does this mean that I was (am) addicted if I feel like I'm having a hard time ""having fun"" without it? It's not like I'm depressed or anything, but really, weed just makes life a bit better for many tasks. Is this normal? Is this common?

Now that that is out of the way, my dealer is my best friend's older sister. I've been buying from her regularly for the past year, but have known her for at least 7.

I learned a few years ago that she had feelings for me, but I was in a position where I didn't need or want a girlfriend. Fast forward to today, and the feeling is still there, but I've fallen for her as well. Every time I pick up it's a little small talk about how we've been, then silence, then we both blush. repeat. Obvious dead ringer for mutual attraction to me. Personally I think we'd make a great couple, but I am wary of how this may affect our business relationship. I mean she's a great woman and all, and deserves a good man like myself, and I'm positive she wants me based on her mannerisms and what my best friend tells me about her, like her asking about how I am doing and so forth, and I also inquire to how she has been as well because I really do like her.

I'm not exactly a particularly new smoker, but I've only been smoking regularly for about six months. Last night for some reason I felt like I was going to faint. After smoking a few bowls from a piece, I had several hits from a bong. Immediately my throat was dry (still is, over 12 hours later) and I felt like I couldn't breathe even after all the smoke had left me. I started losing touch with reality, and freaking out a little mind-wise. I tried not to make it very apparent for my friends, who were just baked. Anyway, the world started spinning, I got a terrible headache, and I started convulsing for a few seconds. I tried drinking, but whenever water when down my throat I started to gag (and this is still happening too.) I thought my throat was blocked up by something. It felt extremely dry, and I literally have no saliva in the back of it now. Anyway, after feeling ultra lightheaded for about an hour or two, some of the high went away, but I still felt fucked up. I had to breathe through my nose, but even then I didn't feel like enough oxygen was going through to my brain. I felt really stupid, and couldn't understand a lot of the things my friends were telling me. Eventually I regained enough of my sanity to come home and knock out for a bunch of hours. I awoke gasping, and even now it feels like my throat is on fire. I also still feel pretty stupid, like I lost a bunch of brain cells or something. Ugh. I just need to recover.

The first 1.5 hits that I took made me feel fine, I was completely chilled out and just genuinely enjoying being outside. However, after taking my next hit things took a turn for the worse. I felt my heart rate increase to what I felt was an abnormal rhythm, I got a terrible case of cotton throat where I couldn't feel what I was swallowing, and I started to freak out a bit. My first question--are these side effects stemming from getting too high too fast? This all happened probably in the span of 15 or so minutes.

I calmed down after a while I started to truly feel zen. Everything was happening around me in what seemed to me like a controlled chaos, and I felt that I was the controller. Then at one point I closed my eyes and got some beautiful closed eye visuals. I never knew trees could give you closed eye visuals! I essentially saw what looked like a spiral of galaxies and just awesome colors. This has never happened to me before--is this normal too?

I was abroad for the past 8 months and haven’t smoked since before I left. I came back, however, to discover that my dealer had been caught by the damn DEA. Apparently they had been following him for weeks, if not months and now he’s at $50,000 bail. Or so I’ve heard. I know one of his friends still deals but I don’t really want to buy from someone who is also probably being watched.

This leaves me, for the first time in my 4 years of smoking, without someone to buy from. I don’t know what to do, I have never had to find someone on my own before. For years my ex would just get it for us, and the dealer who got arrested used to live on my dorm floor so he was an easy find. The main friends I used to smoke with are scattered across the country, my other friends don’t smoke, and the few other associates I know can’t help me. I have managed to get two recommendations but neither worked out. 

What are ways of scoping some out? I am in a large city and I know it’s everywhere around me, but I’m really kind of paranoid about just asking people who look like they smoke or asking strangers at parties. I have known too many people who have went to jail because they dealt with the wrong people, so I try to be cautious. I also don’t want to annoy my fellow smokers and feel like a moocher by just asking people at parties if I can have a hit. I am too shy to do that, and too used to doing it with only a small group of people who I know that doing it with a bunch of strangers would probably not be very enjoyable. So after all that build-up of thinking I’d come home and have a nice packed bowl and some nachos, I have been here for over a month with nothing but frustration.

Any advice or suggestions? "	t5_2rukl	True

------UPDATE------

Yes. Yes you can. I finally went out and bought a little 4 piece grinder thing for 15 bucks. Ground my stuff up good, took about 10 or 15 hits (about 15 seconds of inhaling for each) and am now about [7.35] aka high.

I learned you have to suck on it a bit harder than I originally thought, AND make sure you inhale into your diaphragm. I had to inhale for about ten seconds, and then inhale through my nose and mouth for another 5. That pushed all the vapor down deep and got me what I needed.

1373416744.0	1hz2na	A cool trick I figured out today to make it easier to hide a grinder in your pocket	Ragnrk	25	8	14	"Grinders are usually rather bulky and it's hard to carry one in your jeans pocket without leaving a large, conspicuous bulge that may or may not be a problem depending on your situation. I have to walk through my living room in order to leave my parents' house, and they are often in there. As a result, I rarely bring my grinder with me when I go places for fear that my parents will see the bulge and ask what it is. Well, here's a possible solution. Just remove the middle section that normally holds the bud on your 4-piece grinder and screw the kief catcher directly to the top piece. [Voila!](http://i.imgur.com/m1zGcwJ.jpg) A much smaller grinder, one that I can actually slip into my pocket without worrying if my parents will notice. Of course, as a downside, you no longer have a kief screen, but as a temporary solution to sneak a grinder out of your house, it works great!

I haven't been smoking for very long. Once or twice a week for about two months. When I smoke, everything stops hurting. It's absolutely wonderful. I've tried every pain pill under the sun, and nothing comes close to this. That short respite gets me through the week.

I'm concerned, however, about the potential legal ramifications. Stopping is an absolute last resort, obviously.

1339952677.0	v6lzo	A few newbie questions...	solaritybusk	26	10	48	"**Puff Puff Pass**

* What are you doing, exactly? Do you inhale for each ""puff""? Why don't you just take one long draw, like on a cigarette?

**Smell of Weed**

* How potent is the smell of weed? Is it stronger when it's dormant (hidden in your room) or when it's actually being smoked?

**Smoke Spots**

* How do you find a good outdoor spot to smoke? How far from civilization do you have to be so the smell doesn't tip someone off? How do you avoid getting caught? 

I'm asking because there's this amazing place a half hour drive from me that I'd *love* to smoke at -- right by a waterfall. It's not a public park (to my knowledge) and a few people do go there from time to time, but the ""crowd"" dwindles down closer to sunset. You can walk down a pretty tough trail to get below/behind the waterfall, and further beyond (past some challenging rocks) is a little pool of water surrounded by trees. It's very peaceful, and it's my *ideal* chillage zone.

**Transporting Weed**

* If I buy, say, an 1/8th, put it in a plastic baggy, then put that plastic baggy inside a disposable plastic container/pill bottle/etc. will it stink up my car if it's in there for about an hour drive?

**Steps Before/During/After Buying Weed**

I know at least three people off the top of my head who I could contact about getting a hold of some herb. I'm nervous about buying my first stash, but they're very cool people so it's just a matter of getting over my nerves and outright asking for their help. My question is...

* Do I need to ""weed proof"" my room before I buy some? I'm living with my mother (I'm 21, however) but will be moving out to my own apartment (shared with a roommate) in August, for college. Should I wait until I move? Would smoking here be fine for a month or so?

* If it's *doable* to smoke at my mother's house until I move, what are the risks of smoking outside? We have a fairly private backyard -- surrounded by tall wooden fences on one side -- but we are literally *surrounded* by neighbors. Front, sides, and back. Would the smell of weed be too overpowering?

* If I need to *wait until I move*, how safe is it to smoke in an apartment in a typical ""college town""?

I'm 15, open minded and I'll be having my first joint next friday and I'm just having a little respect about what could happen after it.
I'm usually a silent person, but I got interested in weed, because I'm in a political party in my country which supports it. 
I have never touched any drug before, not even alcohol or tabacco.

But yeah, I actually did not think of myself ever getting into drugs, but now I'm going to try it thx to a little help to my own group of GGGs. It was/is awkward talking to them about me wanting to try.

Anyway, here is what I'm worried about.
""Preparing"" it.
I've actually tried to inform myself on the net, but it doesn't help me much. I'm wondering about what I should take care of before smoking, what I should have with me and how to ""get rid"" of all visible evidence on me since I'll be smoking in a hidden area with my friend in a park. I couldn't do it at home because my parents are always here.

Oh and BTW, about the smell. I can't use perfume or something like that because I usually don't and my parents will obviously notice it.

Sorry if this is just another noob post with fail english, I'm just a little excited and overwhelmed on how to attack this.

Oh and I think I'll have it pure since I haven't had tabacco before and I wanna make it the best way possible.

However, I don't feel comfortable smoking or vaping anything that I don't know a lot about and I'm having some trouble finding information about the addictive qualities (if any), the main effects, and the side effects of some of the more popular herbs. I've been to a few sites and the information usually given is along the lines of ""these are legal,"" ""people have been smoking these for centuries"" and ""you won't fail a drug test by smoking these."" It's all rather topical and just more advertisement, which doesn't help me.

So, my questions are:

* What are some of more popular smoking herbs and what effects and side effects are there? (Damiana is the one I have found the most information about and is the one I am most interested in)
* Which (if any) smoking herbs are especially damaging and are best avoided?
* Is it safe to mix any herbs with marijuana for more flavor or a different kind of high?"	t5_2rukl	True

So, what are my risks?

Oh, and a little bit of background...  I've only smoked a handful of times.  I get really high really easily because of my lack of tolerance, (I plan on keeping a low tolerance)  and also because I don't weigh very much.  I realize that this reduces my risk of cancer but it still bothers me.

This is fine, he's my friend and I really don't mind smoking him out, we always smoke together anyway so no problem. 

The problem is that recently when I buy any bud he is always referring to it as 'ours' and he's the one with our guy's number so I can't buy without telling him. Sometimes i just want to buy a sac and have a self toke you know? And it's getting more and more difficult to do so, as well as I am feeling kind of obligated to smoke him out.

1324047368.0	nf7a7	A Saplings first time, ever. Using a MFLB.	ryou516	25	8	9	"I always wanted to try trees. I spent about a month reading and educating myself about it, mostly here on /r/saplings, and on /r/trees.

**This is the story of how it went the first time I used trees. Written the very next morning after.**


I had just bought the MFLB. I was planning on smoking it with my gf &amp; my best friend today, but when I realized my dealer lived a lil bit far from me, I didn't want to drive that far today so I just went yesterday to have the supply ready.

During my drive back, I considered smoking that very same night, alone. There was only one thing: my parents were home (they wouldn't be today).

After much internal debating, and approval from my gf (she wanted me to wait for her at first), I decided to go with it. Windows open.

I took out 1g (my dealer gave me 1 little plastic back per g) from the aluminum container I had. I took 1/3 of it and put it in my grinder. Grounded up that, and after a few taps and a few more grinds, it was done. 

I opened my MFLB and started pouring into the trench, just to realize *it was way too much*. I ended up needing only 1/3 of that to fill up the trench (math done, I'd get 6+ trenches out of 1g), which I thought was brilliant.

I left it there, and went to play a few matches of MW3 (PC) with my friends. I had a few of them on *ventrilo*, including my GF (who also plays MW3 with my buddies).

After a couple of matches, I asked my GF thru steam ""Should I do it now?"" and she said ""if you want xD"". So I told them 'brb' and stood up.

Went to get my *MFLB*, the stem, and my freshly charged battery and stood next to the window.

I pressed the battery in and after a few seconds, vapor started filling the chamber. I placed my mouth at the tip of the stem and started inhaling. Blew the smoke out of the window.

Did not feel a thing. Tried without the stem as I realized there were times I was letting go of the battery; didn't realize I needed to press it that hard during the entire process. I shook the herbs between hits. Coughing happened, but I knew it was normal.

No stem, didn't feel a thing either, but without the stem the vapor felt a lot hotter. So I plugged the stem right back and, after another wasted hit, I finally got the hang of it and started to *feel* the vapor instead of just tasting it. Figured I was leaving my mouth way too open and the vape was escaping.

About the taste: It tastes just like tobacco, but a lil bit smoother, and not as sour or unpleasant. 

Still not feeling that much, I left it there to rest, stood up and started walking around the room. Then, after a few seconds, it hit me. 

I felt a need to sit down, then just to lay down...then I started laughing for no reason. What a unique experience.

After the initial buzz, I jumped right back at my pc and started talking to my GF thru ventrilo...and then we both joined the channel where our friends were. Started talking shit like crazy, I wouldn't stop.

Here's a rundown of how I felt:

**Physically**

* My body felt heavy and kinda clumsy
* I felt dizzy, but not nauseated. It wasn't a bad feeling.
* I felt like someone replaced my blood with lemonade. My veins felt funny and cold, but it wasn't a bad feeling.
* I did feel hungry, which I was prepared for with a Taco Bell burrito.
* You know when stoner rage comics have red eyes and swollen up eyelids? It was exactly like that when I looked at myself in the mirror. Eyes were as pink as cotton candy.
* I was having a hard time maintaining a train of thought, especially when talking to people.

**Emotionally**

* I felt a kind of calm inside. Felt like everything was gonna be just fine.
* It was almost physically impossible for me to get mad or upset about something. I was just...happy.
* Just wanted to talk. I felt friendly as hell. 
* Relaaxxxxxxxxx
* I did not feel any kind of paranoia or fear.

That effect lasted about 2 hours (didn't know if it would have lasted more, I went to sleep). It peaked for the first 40 minutes or so, then it gradually (but very slowly) started to vanish, but I was still pretty numb and happy when I went to sleep.

If I were to imagine how high could you get with trees, on a scale of 1 to 10, I would say I got pretty close to 7 or 8. I think I could definitely get a bit more fucked up in the head with it, but what I felt was pretty intense. Of course, it personally was my [10].

So that's that.
As far as addiction goes, getting high, I feel as I wouldn't do this everyday. It was a lot like drinking for me. I'd just do it when there's an occasion. I don't feel a need to smoke other than because it felt good and I want to feel that again...but not more as opposed to how you would buy a prime steak every once in a while just because it tastes fucking amazing. 

There's a desire, but not a need. I would be sad if I didn't get to do it again, but it not the end of the world. 

Thanks to everybody who helped me. The guys from /r/trees, /r/saplings, and the awesome guys from the /r/trees IRC. 

Today I will be smoking with my best friend, and I'm gonna guide him.

Thank you for reading this.

**TL;DR** After a few screw-ups with the MFLB, finally got high and it was awesome.

We were hitting out of my small bong and she went to throw up. She stopped and then started again, froze, and fell face first in her throw up and had a seizure. She sat on the utility box for a moment, stood up and the passed out and hit her head on the green thing and had another seizure. Then she sat up on the ground in front of the box for a moment to gather her self. Stood up another time and passed out and hit her head on the concrete and had a seizure. Where was I? Well I was trying to calm her down and keep for from falling, but they happened at spacious times where she kept trying to assure me she was okay and needed a minute. Usually when we're done with a smoke session, she needs a moment where she sits there and closes her eyes, so her needing a moment wasn't unusal. After the last time, I made her sit down for a while and then I drove us to her house. She remembers nothing but throwing up and passing out. 	t5_2rukl	True
