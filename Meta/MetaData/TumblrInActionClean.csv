I want to talk about how I was suckered into a hate movement, and how others can prevent themselves from falling into it as well. 

I guess I'll answer the obvious stuff first.

1.) Why did you ever support radical feminism?

In large part because I was disillusioned by mainstream feminism's lack of concern for prostituted women and women forced into the porn industry via human trafficking. I was led to believe that it was the only strain of feminism or humanitarianism that took action against this. But another huge reason: I'm a survivor of abuse by a male relative. It was easy to convince me that all men are inherently predators because I was betrayed by a father figure. I believe that many radical feminists are survivors of abuse and assault by men, and the fear of all men that can result makes us vulnerable to ideologies like radical feminism. Not all RFs are survivors, but many are. 

2.) Did you hate men?

Yes and no. Yes, because the rape statistics and horrible tales of crime combined with my being a survivor of CSA convinced me that men are inclined towards rape. It was a successful appeal by emotion. In truth, men harm men, too, and women also commit horrible crimes, but according to radical feminism women are *always* the victim in this world. 

But at the same time I did not hate men. I held a peculiar kind of cognitive dissonance that I think is common among radical feminists. You love your male friends and family that have not harmed you, but at the same time, men are *the enemy*. I'm a lesbian, and there's a sense of solidarity against men amongst lesbian radical feminists, even where none truly exists. Radical feminists are prone to paranoia and even turn on each other. A lot. Paranoia and irrational hatred drives radical feminism. 

3.) What made you leave? 

In a nutshell, the cognitive dissonance. I tried to juggle my feelings of compassion for trans* people with the hateful stuff we were led to believe about them. I tried to reconcile that (awful) ""all men are rapists"" worldview with the caring and compassionate men I am lucky enough to have in my life. It didn't work. I couldn't stay that way with my integrity intact. Now I'm on a waiting list to see a counselor to help me heal from the psychological impact of CSA. 

4.) Why did you make this thread?

To share my story, and hopefully open the eyes of some people who've been suckered into radical feminism. 

5.) How can I help a radical feminist see the light? 

Be gentle with them. Just like any exclusionary ideology, taking a hostile approach just makes them more isolated and insular (and ""confirms"" in their mind that they are being oppressed). If you choose to confront a radfem, keep this in mind: a large amount of them are survivors of abuse by men. They are alienating themselves and living in a bubble of paranoid fear. The ones who are survivors of abuse are not dealing with their trauma properly. Those who are simply hateful, however, are bigots and not worth engaging IMO. I hope they will figure it out for themselves.

In conclusion: I hope this is helpful and in the right subreddit. Please ask me anything, and I will try my best to give a thorough answer. Thanks, Reddit. 

edit: Never expected 40 upvotes and so much feedback! Thank you so much for taking the time to ask me questions and read my post. 

edit #2: I have to go for a bit to do some things off in the real world, but I will answer every question I get when I'm back!

edit #3: Wow, this has had an overwhelming response. I had no idea so many people would be so interested in my rambling, and I'm grateful for how kind everyone's been. I'm trying my best to answer all questions, there's so many and I've never done this before. 

edit #4: I'm really moved that people have found this insightful, and I know I missed some of your questions (sorry about that, I've never done an AMA before this one and lost my place on the page a few times, lol). I'll continue answering tomorrow morning for a bit, so if there's anything else you guys would like to ask me go for it. :) I'll try to keep up. take care."	t5_2vizz	True

Sagebrysh	843	165	382	"It seems like these days every other **(trigger word: sexual language)** fucking word could be a **(trigger word: trigger)** trigger. I'm transgender, my friends call me **(trigger word: homophobia, transphobia)** faggot and tranny. And you know how much it affects me? *it doesn't*. Its just words. They're not actually oppressing me. They're my friends. I call them **(trigger word: homophobia)** fags right back.

 What has happened to our society that we've equated 'bad words' with actual oppression? When gay people aren't allowed to marry, that's actual oppression. Calling your friend a **(trigger word: homophobia)** fag is not oppressing anyone (except possibly english majors). If I get **(trigger word: rape culture)** raped and killed, that's *actually* bad. Saying ""I raped that noob"" in a first person shooter isn't hurting anyone. If I get denied medical care and protection under the law for being trans, that is *actual* oppression. If someone says I should go die, unless they actually plan on making that happen, I can just shrug it off and move on. Have we gotten so PC as a culture that we equate hurt feelings with actual oppression? Don't we have more important things to worry about? The people actually responsible for real, systematic oppression of minorities don't give a **(trigger word: sexual language)** fuck about hurt feelings. So why has the focus of social activism shifted away from actually trying to get people equal rights and protections under the law, towards making sure no one's feel feels are hurt? There are bigger things at stake then my emotions, and it especially is irritating when all these TSJWs claim to be speaking for me. They don't speak for me. If they actually did, they'd stop worrying about people calling me tranny, and worry about people who are *actually trying to take my rights away*.

So consider this the SJA dictionary if you will.

**Otherkin**

A person who describes themselves as otherkin believes they are an animal in the body of a human. As if this wasn't already crazy enough, some Tumblr SJAs have extended the definition to include fictional creatures and characters too.

**Headmates**

This is basically a fancy word for imaginary friends. A person who describes themselves as having headmates is saying that they have people living in their heads who they have conversations with.

**Multiple systems**

People who describe themselves as multiple systems (also known as multiples, multiplicity, plurals, alts, and many other names) take the idea of headmates one step further by believing that they actually have multiple people who make up their multiple personalities. So a person who describes themselves as a multiple system will likely refer to themselves as ""they"" because they believe they are multiple people. When they are acting as the personality of one of their headmates, they call this ""fronting"".

And, because that isn't already batshit insane enough, some multiple systems will have headmates who are animals, otherkin people, and, of course, fictional characters. Insane enough yet? No? Well you're in luck, because I've not even got to the people who believe they have galaxies, nebulae, universes, and other space shit, either in their ""headspace"" or as an otherkin. So some people will believe *they are actually galaxies.*

**Transethnic/transabled**

People who describe themselves as transethnic believe they are a person of different ethnicity to their actual ethnicity living inside their body. So, for example, a white girl may claim she's actually a black woman living inside a white woman's body.

Transabled people claim the same thing but with disabilities. So someone with perfect vision may claim they're actually a blind person living inside a normal person's body.

**Demisexual/skoliosexual/lithromantic/and other made up orientations**

Ever on the prowl for ways to make themselves seem cool and different, Tumblr SJAs often give themselves weird sexual and romantic orientations which only exist in SJA communities and sometimes only on Tumblr itself.

Defining all of these would take up a whole post in itself, but I'll define the ones I mentioned in the title. If you see others, do a Google search and see what you find.

* Demisexual means that you are only sexually attracted to people once you have an emotional connection to them.
* Skoliosexual means, to quote from the [""Queer Dictionary"" Tumblr blog](http://queerdictionary.tumblr.com/post/9892676587/skoliosexual-adj), ""a potential sexual attraction to non-binary identified individuals."" Good luck making sense of that.
* Lithromantic means you enjoy loving someone but not having those feelings returned. [It has its own Tumblr, this one.](http://lithromantic.tumblr.com/)

**Cisgender**

The term cisgender, often shortened to cis, is recent invention which simply means someone isn't transgender. The vast majority of Tumblr SJAs are not trans but they will complain about ""cis privilege"" regardless, which brings me nicely onto...

**Made up privilege and oppression**

The favourite passtime for SJAs is to pretend they're oppressed, and they are all professional victims. You may very well see otherkin telling people to ""check their human privilege"" while they talk about how oppressed they are because no one believes they're really a cat in a human body. Privilege, in this context, is another concept made up by SJAs. Those who are apparently ""oppressed"" have less privilege than those who aren't. Whoever has less privilege wins the Oppression Olympics!

This attitude is also used in more legitimate movements such as **feminism**. A great deal of Tumblr users have hijacked feminism and used it to claim all women are victims and all men are oppressors. You will see many examples of this in Tumblr feminist blogs, one of the most notable of which is [About Male Privilege.](http://aboutmaleprivilege.tumblr.com/tagged/submission) Because complaining about the made up privilege of other groups (or even their own groups) is their favourite thing to do.

So, now you know what goes on in the mind of an SJA and how to make sense of their unique dialect. Go forth unto the world and check some privilege!"	t5_2vizz	True

Always remember not to group every transgender or other minority group with these drama queens, as some of them do actually face oppression in their daily life (though not from a giant faceless invisible monster called the ""patriarchy""). 
You guys are awesome anyway, just a reminder that these people are a very small percentage of their respective groups, the ""vocal minority"" if you will. Don't generalize and everyone wins :)"	t5_2vizz	True

Not that this would matter much, as the SJWs here on Tumblr aren’t interested in intellectual discussions; those are exactly what “check your privilege"" is meant to prevent. It’s a thought-terminating cliché and an ad hominem attack, essentially translating to “Shut up, whitey!"" or a relevant equivalent.

A lot of people are probably eager to tell me that all it “really"" means is that some people have inherent advantages because of certain attributes they have, and we should be cognizant of this. This seems harmless enough if we just take their word for it. Indeed, the concept of “privilege"" often crops up as an excuse for pseudointellectual postmodernist crybabies to pretend that whining about their First World Problems is a form of social activism.

The problem with the refrain that “some people have inherent advantages"" is that “some people"" are really “everyone"". Yes, there are some advantages to being a man and disadvantages do being a woman, but the opposite is also true. There are drawbacks to being black, but there are also benefits. This is a fact of life, not a fact of life that needs to be (or even can be) eradicated.

I once read someone who wrote that everyone accepts that there are people who are underprivileged, so obviously some people are “privileged"" or “overprivileged"". This argument is perhaps one of the most disingenuous pieces of shit I have ever read. “Underprivileged"" is just a euphemism for “poor"". You don’t call a gay person “underprivileged"". This is a blatant example of the fallacy of four terms.

Make no mistake; someone who tells people to “check their privilege"" is not merely trying to make people more “aware"" of yadda-yadda-yadda. This is the mantra of an ideology that attempts to separate people into two groups: people who have “privilege"", and people who don’t. If you don’t have “privilege"", its because you’re being discriminated against and oppressed by those who do.

When you make an argument or express your opinion, and someone tells you to “check your privilege"", what they’re really saying is that you should just shut up, because you’re the enemy. You’re the oppressor, and you don’t get to have an opinion. Unless, of course, you completely and unequivocally agree with them, in which case they might decide to be so generous as to grant you the right to an opinion."	t5_2vizz	True

This is understandable, of course, but oftentimes these views of various mental illness are shaped less by what the disorder is actually like and more by how the media presents them. And we wouldn't want you all coming away from TiA thinking people with schizophrenia are as bad as SJWs now, would we?

So one of our awesome subscribers, SentWest, who has a BS in psychology (and has shown me evidence of this qualification) has written a post about various types of bloggers we see here and common misconceptions about mental health disorders related to them. 

Since the post is so long (and has a massive list of references at the end, cuz we science over here) it's a whole fucking blog post in itself. [Click and enjoy.](http://daydreamobscura.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/otherkin-multiple-systems-and-mental.html)

I was at fashion show practice yesterday, and I noticed that one of the directors refuses to use the words ""guys"" and ""girls"". Instead, he says ""male-identified"" and ""female-identified"". And I wonder how exactly that's supposed to be more politically correct. It means the same damn thing! 

Also, am I alone in thinking that saying ""male-identified"" and ""female-identified"" is actually *more* dismissive of trans people than saying ""guys"" and ""girls"" would be? Saying ""guys"" and ""girls"" sends the message that trans men and women are no different from cis men and women, that their gender is just as legitimate. Saying ""male-identified"" and ""female-identified"" implies that trans people are somehow separate from cis people, that they're not ""real"" men and women. 

Funny how being ""progressive"" seems to come full circle, huh?

&gt; **Privilege-splaining**: It may seem that we are biased in favor of oppressed groups. The reality is we're revoking the bias in favor of privileged groups that has become so normalized as to be invisible. The phrase ""check your privilege"" (or similar) is not an invitation to explain at even greater length than you've already done that you don't have privilege and are simply right. This behavior will be met with mockery and moderator action up to and including banning.

&gt; There is one thread here about veteran activists but most of what little I've seen seems to actually be exclusionary of older people. Most likely this is not intentional and probably stems from the same privilege blindness that afflicts us about other issues.

[""transophobic language""](http://atheismplus.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=445)

&gt; just a quick note to everyone: I've seen in a number of threads phrases like ""everyone with a penis"" being used to mean men. please watch your language, and do not do this. Don't make cutesy quips about chromosomes, balls, penises, boobs, and other things that have nothing to do with gender identity, and thus exclude trans, intersex, CAIS, etc. folks from the groups ""men"" and ""women"". Let's try not to exclude folks for whom these various physiological bits are at variance with their gender identity, ok?

But that's not all! [There is special subset of rules for dealing with being ""called out"" for your privileged perspective](http://atheismplus.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1216&amp;sid=92bfeb93af24272b83278d7ca8516353#p16283): 

&gt; 1\. Don’t tone police. It is NOT your right to dictate how someone should react to their oppression.

&gt; 2\. Don’t demand a detailed explanation. You’re basically asking the person to justify their call out. It’s exhausting, many resources are available, and often this is just a way to try and derail, start an argument, or discredit the other person.

&gt; 6\. Don’t assume the person calling you out is just “looking to get offended”. Nobody enjoys calling other people out. To call someone out, people often have to mentally prepare for serious repercussions. Calling someone out might mean starting an argument, during which many people will side with the oppressor by default (especially if you’re privileged over the person calling you out).

You're all in violation of this one, shitlords, so

&gt; 12\. LISTEN.

&gt; 13\. Genuinely apologize.

&gt; 14\. Work on oppression reduction and being the best ally you can be. The point of calling you out is to draw your attention to how you’re being oppressive, so that you can work to change it. **If you made an oppressive joke, there’s probably oppressive thoughts in place (conscious or not) that led you to think the joke was appropriate.** Everyone has to unlearn the oppressive things they’ve absorbed from an oppressive society. We are all taught ways to keep marginalized people in their place, but the good thing is that we can identify these things in ourselves and change. And then we can start working on dismantling the kyriarchy, yeah!

This is not satire. Your jokes reveal your impure thoughts. 

This particular strain of SJWs, however, is magnanimous — they're giving you a chance to fix it. You can [confess your sins here in ""The «I messed up and I'm not sure why or how» thread""](http://atheismplus.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=3838):

&gt; Because a lot of shitstorms in the threads recently have been due to Privileged Person not understanding Marginalized Person's POV and expecting MP to explain to PP what went wrong where, here's a thread where PP can ask without further stepping on MP's toes, and where those with the spoons to answer can offer insight.

All of these people have one thing in common: Their lives and identities are based around one thing. Feminism, Kinship, you name it. It is their life, what they spend the majority of their time doing.

These people are incredibly boring. They make their entire life about a single thing, because they HAVE NOTHING ELSE. There is nothing else about them that is interesting, or worth discussing in their opinion. It's why they try so hard to come up with so many labels for themselves, to set them apart from others as someone who matters.

And this holds true for so many people alive today. Guys who talk about nothing but the girls they fucked, gay guys who can't stop talking about how fucking gay they and lisp the whole way doing it, guys who brag about how ""gangsta"" they are, hipsters, girls who can't help but talk about how they like women too and that they've sucked a billion dicks.

Society tells us that boring people are undesirable. Not only that, but it also tells us that AVERAGE people are undesirable. If you're average, then you're not interesting, and not important. And people cope with this idea by coming up with whatever they can to make themselves interesting and important, even if they are just the opposite.

It's manifested itself in so many ways, and Tumblr is just one of the largest examples of people who are like that.

I am pissed off and I want to rant to people who will understand.

I am friends with some size-acceptance people on facebook because I used to be fat, and I tried (and still do) to promote acceptance of people for who they are as humans, not what they look like. One of that group of friends commented on a 250+ comment post on facebook by another size-acceptance person. Because it was so long, I couldn't screencap it and post it here.

But basically, it was a bunch of fat chicks and their chubby-chasing white knights attacking this *one kid* because he said they were being sexist. Which they were.

The lead fatty started the hate-brigade, and all of her fat acceptance soldiers jumped on the gravy train to cunstville, basically humiliating and insulting this poor kid for trying to point out their hypocrisy.

The whole fucking thing pissed me off, and it made me realize the number one reason I am in this sub so much lately.

**Of all the ""Social Justice Warriors"" on the internet, the fat ones piss me off the most** because they are the only 'oppressed' people that have the option to *completely change what is keeping them oppressed*!

Eat less pizza, exercise more, stop sexualizing your obesity, and learn to recognize the fact that you are *choosing* to be fat, therefore you are owed jack-fucking-shit! No one should have to pander to your preferences and kowtow to the fact that you have made yourself a pariah! The media makes people hate you? No! **YOU** make people hate you!

As a disclaimer, I want to point out that I full-well understand that some people have issues and difficult relationships with their weight and food. I am not including regular people who are big people and just live their lives. I am specifically targeting my anger towards people who made the decision to become or remain fat, and go out of their way to throw it in your face.

It pisses me off.

The end.

Two characteristics of this game are that (once you find a weapon) it's really easy to kill someone, and when you're killed it's a real pain in the ass to start over.

As a result of these two characteristics, if someone gets the jump on you then you're at their mercy. If they offer to forego killing you in exchange for some possession you have, then you're actually thankful - they could have just killed you and taken it. Instead, they basically mug you. This happens all the time in DayZ.

**Story:** [Here's a story posted to /r/dayz about a mugging victim that turned out to be a feminist](http://np.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/1jjz0b/i_got_called_a_misogynist_in_dayz_today/). In summary, the guy just needed some pain pills, so he mugged another player. He had no way of knowing the gender of the other player prior to the mugging - it's not like they targeted her because she was a woman. Nonetheless, she takes it personally and claims that he ""was being misogynistic for attempting to assert power over a woman"""	t5_2vizz	True

Due to the nature of a small staff and long hours, I grew to know her rather well, and have a variety of stories to tell and insight to share.

From defending the job of a functionally-illiterate woman because she was a person of color (a functionally-illiterate person working as a reporter for a newspaper, mind), to drunken 2 AM confessions, to very nearly being fired because she refused to bathe (and threatening legal action because of it), the list goes on.

But it's not all just silly stories. After spending that much time with her and her friends, I think I have come to understand many of these people uncomfortably well. Not to generalize, of course, as my experience is still limited, and I can't claim to speak for all of them.

So, feel free to ask away!

Edit: A little info on this woman. She was lower middleclass, white, pansexual identifying, severely overweight, and very passionate about rape culture, cultural appropriation, and fatphobia/thinprivilege. She was also very mad about cultural expectations of women, and so did not shave or bathe with any frequency. She had a wispy but rather long chin beard, very puffy armpit hair, and wore what I think is called a mumu (floral patterned, loose flowing and nonrestrictive dress). She was also vegan, and often complained about vegan oppression (despite the city where we worked being SUPER vegan friendly).

Edit2: Thanks for all the great questions and discussion! I have to step out for a bit for an interview (a journalist is always on the clock) but keep asking questions and opening up discussion and I'll be back in an hour or two to answer more!

Edit3: Back!

Final Edit: Thank you all for the great questions and interesting discussion. I had a good time and it was nice to share some stories and insight. Take care! (Also, I may still be lurking among these comments...)"	t5_2vizz	True

I remember when I first discovered other kinds of sexualities, e.g., asexuality, demisexuality, etc. When I read about demisexuality, I thought, ""Oh hey! I kinda fit into that! I can't really have sex unless it's with someone I love. I didn't know there was a name for that! Cool!"" Then I heard about pansexuality, etc. Then atypical gender expressions entered my life, and I thought it was interesting that people felt a different gender from their assigned sex. From then on I thought the world of sexual orientation was so interesting and much more vast than before. It was exciting, and I decided to become a sex education major and teach the sociology and psychology of human sexuality in college. I loved the idea of educating people who were eager to learn about it, and possibly create more open minds.  

Then I hear about these assholes. These guys give my interests a bad name. When someone says something offensive or ignorant, people aren't supposed to get livid at them, and then say, ""It's not my job to educate you shitlord!"" Well then it's not your job to get angry at them either. You can't just get pissed off at someone for something they don't know. You really expect people to know what the difference is between transgender and transsexual right off the top of their head? Hell, I just found out about a month ago! And did my professor get pissed off at me for being ignorant about it? No, cause she's a positive professional non-biased intelligent person, unlike you. You're just a self-victimizing pseudo-activist with a bunch of over complicated gender pronouns because you have so much anger towards yourself, you have to blame somebody besides yourself (Sorry I should check my pronoun privilege and give the option ""xour"").

I learned a new word today. Transabled. This means someone who believes they are disabled trapped in a standard body and that people should recognize them for this and oh the feels, blah blah blah. Here's why this pisses me off in particular.

There are a lot of disabled people in the world who should be enraged at this shit but I'm going to mention one in particular.

I have a cousin who has FOP. Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva. What this means is ""your body gradually replaces every fucking muscle you have with bone and traps you in your own goddamn skin so you can't move."" On top of that, after her first major flare-up, doctors misdiagnosed her with cancer, and amputated her right arm and shoulder. She happens to be right handed. Oh, and surgery is about the worst goddamn thing you can do to someone with FOP. She currently uses a wheelchair most of the time, but can walk laboriously with a cane, and barely has use of her other arm. 

However, just about every time I start to bitch and piss and moan about my stupid life, I see some update from her on Facebook about how great and beautiful life is, and how happy she is for what she has. She spends all of her time raising money and fighting for a cure that she will probably never live to see. I have not ever once heard her bitch about anything and what really got me was her Christmas wish, quoted below.

""I wish there was some give room between my arm and side .. Due to the FOP my one arm is stuck glued to my side from the elbow to shoulder .. I can only wear thin type tops .. Ugh :( .. Ok that is all .. #wishesicouldwearcuterclothesfortheholiday""

That's the closest thing to a complaint I've ever seen out of her.

And then today I hear about this transabled bullshit and I just had to bitch. Sorry if this is the wrong place, but if anyone has a better idea, please let me know. Every time I feel sorry for myself for having an eating disorder, or a past drug addiction, or any other stupid, self-indulgent whiny first world bullshit like that, or when i don't want to leave the house because I'm in a bad mood (bawwwww), I try to think of her. These transbullshit people should be ashamed.

Source of transabled word that I heard: x-trung.tumblr.com 

EDIT: shit I could claim if I gave a fuck:developmentally disabled Demi-bisexual rape survivor addict anorexic. But I don't give a fuck. I like being mocked. It keeps me in line and means people accept you.

EDIT 2: I forgot non-white Jewish.

I've had a Tumblr for going on four years now. My family's pretty liberal so when I saw the SJ scene pop up more and more I decided to look into it, and I got pretty engrossed for a while. I got to Uni and got into Reddit and realized I was being kind of silly, though my first few months on Reddit I was subbed to SRS and agreed with a lot of the things they said. Then I found TiA and was like, oh. This is dumb. Some things:

* Tumblr SJ made me afraid of men. I didn't notice it so much until after I broke away from the mindset, but basically yeah. I was having anxiety when around any dude I didn't know personally. I don't feel that way anymore. 
* Reddit made me not afraid of men. I've read through a lot of different subs on here like /r/mensrights and /r/askmen and it opened my eyes to how silly I was being.
* White, cisgendered, straight, 18 Y/O girl. I was the poster child for the Tumblr SJ movement.
* Since leaving Tumblr and joining Reddit I have changed my major from Women's Studies because I realized from Reddit how useless that was.

Yeah so basically ask me whatever you want! I'm not sure how to provide proof since I'm not comfortable releasing my blog with my personal information on it. But I voted for Obama and I annoyed most of my friends, I promise.

EDIT: I'm kind of bouncing back and forth between this account and my default one so if it takes a while to get back to you, I'm sorry! I'm really enjoying answering all your questions :)

*Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law)*

Since the aflux of newcommers, I've seen more and more people abusing the word ""Poe"" (In the sense that they use it without knowing exactly what it means).


""This is Poe"" doesn't mean it is fake. ""This is Poe"" means you can't tell if it's fake or not. ""I call Poe"" doesn't mean that you think it's fake; it means that you can't tell if it's fake or not. ""I'm pretty sure it's Poe"" means nothing.


Are you sure that something is fake? Then say it's fake. That something is legit? Then say it's legit. Can't tell? Call Poe.

[[**TL;DR: Poe Law != it's fake**.](http://i.imgur.com/XTvoV.gif)](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9a4la4c5S1qil2luo17_r1_500.gif)

1376616772.0	1kgk2y	I went to a pseudo-SJW high school. AMA	Lepontine	233	41	140	"Hello my beautiful, veluptous, PoC, queer-femme, trans-appropriated womyn/ethereal dragon-kins.

I graduated from my dear high school this past year, and have realized that it was very much an 'SJW' authority. This is a private high school located in the Uptown area of Minneapolis, Minnesota. A liberal, residential area, which was great in itself - especially during Minnesota's allowance of same-sex marriage- however all great things can be taken too far.

Actions of note include a 'racial integrity/equality' room, which white people could not enter, as it would disturb the arduous process of improving race relations- alienation does that, right?

Additionally, an experienced, and very qualified teacher was nearly fired at the request of our LGBT community leader, upon discovering that she did not support same sex marriage. While I don't agree with that teacher's thoughts, she did not let it interfere with her students' education, and had no bearing on her as a professional.

There are more, so if there's interest, ask away! 

**Edit for more stories!**

* This was the only high school to take part in an event called Take Back The Night, two years ago, which raised awareness for sexual harassment and assault, which was great. Not as great, was the event's return this past year. During an assembly, a video was shown which discussed sexual violence for around 5 minutes. The second that the narrators started discussing violence towards males, the video was shut off, and two male sport captains were required to take to the stage and ask the male audience members to raise their hand if they disagreed with sexual assault. Because all men are rapists until asked otherwise. Additionally, all the advertisements contained images which would lead one to believe only women are raped. I feel as though if you're raising awareness for an issue, advertise the whole issue, not just one gender's misfortunes. 
 
And feel free to call me a shitlord. I'm privileged to be writing to you all.

I said no simply because this blogger is a known scammer, but it made me think of a better idea.

**Why don't we all get together and actually raise money for a proper charity?** This place [gets almost a million hits a month](http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/18ele4/holy_fucking_shit_i_just_looked_at_the_traffic/) now. I feel we can really make a difference if we each donate just a little bit. And hey, when some Tumblr asshole or SRSer calls us evil scum we can point out that we're the ones actually helping people...

My thoughts are that it should be a mental health charity because most of what we do is make fun of people we deem ""crazy"". But maybe you'd prefer if it was a gay rights charity? Or something else entirely?

I want to get everyone involved in this. We will decide together what charity to donate to and we will all donate a little money each. We might even try and encourage other people we know (either online or in real life) to do the same. If even a small portion of people who visit us donate $5 we can make a real difference here.

So the purpose of this thread is to plan our campaign.

We will decide:

1) What charity to donate to.

2) If/how we will get as many people on board as possible.

3) Pat each other on the back for actually making a positive difference in the real world.

I'm not saying you guys are dumb or stupid, and I'm not trying to offend you guys at all. It's basically the  TV shows and the movie's fault that everyone thinks that assault = physically hurting someone.

* Assault - Putting someone in fear of immediate danger. Example: Pulling out a knife and saying ""I'm going to cut you shitlord!""

* Battery - Inflicting actual physical harm on another person, or touching them without their consent. Example ""I just cut you shitlord!""

And again, don't think that I'm calling you guys idiots or anything, I didn't know this either until I took highschool law studies.

edit: I forgot to add that you can't be charged with ""Assault and battery"". You **can** be charged with them as two seperate crimes though. 

edit2: Thanks to /u/Mukake for this detailed explanation:

So assault and battery are different depending on the jurisdiction as well. Because of this, the FBI defines it 3 ways:

* Aggravated Assault: Use of a weapon and/or aggravated injuries

* Simple Assault: No weapons and no serious injuries

* Intimidation: Implying you have a weapon and/or making other threats

******Wall of text warning!******

Like most people, I came across this subreddit after finding myself annoyed at all the whiny self-pity and manufactured oppression found on Tumblr. But then I realized that internet SJWs are just that: they exist only on the internet. In any insular community, internet forums especially, surrounding yourself with people who simply reinforce your own opinions can lead to some... unique ideas that are generally not reflected in the rest of society.

Over the course of my life I have interacted with what I would consider to be a fairly diverse selection of individuals from all walks of life, and I have (almost) never encountered the kind of shenanigans you see on Tumblr. For example:

**Trans Issues:** I have known a handful of trans* individuals, 3 of which I would consider friends. None of them have ever demanded to be treated with special delicate politically correct care, be referred to with special pronouns, or have lashed out against straight/cisgendered people just for being who they are. On the other hand, I've observed them having to endure a fairly harrowing emotional (and/or physical) process, mostly alone, and quietly put up with a lot of hostility from people who don't understand them (i.e., most people they have to interact with on a daily basis).

**Womens Issues:** I have known plenty of feminists, including politically active ones. Pretty much all of them are level-headed, average people who don't hate men or want to ""destroy the Patriarchy,"" but simply care about womens rights, which is a legitimate issue. I have had a few rare experiences with getting an angry, self-righteous lecture from someone over a complete triviality (like opening a door for someone, which many people view as a common courtesy that they would extend to everyone, not just women). That is by far a vocal minority, though.

**Fat Activism:** I have known many overweight or obese people (God bless America). Of those that I have known well, maybe 50% of them have had severe body image issues at some point, about 95% of them wanted to get in better shape, and exactly 0% of them ever mentioned ""thin privilege,"" the concept of being transthin, or the idea that they are an oppressed minority deserving of a civil rights movement. I have listened to some of them complain about the shallowness of society and how they wish they could fit in better, but I think that's completely understandable.

**Veganism/Vegetarianism:** Of all the vegans and vegetarians I've known, nearly all of them didn't even mention their dietary choices until it was brought up in a relevant context (e.g., going out to eat with them or inviting them over for dinner). I myself eat very little meat, but I see no reason to ever make that an issue, unless someone specifically asks about, say, the environmental impact of the meat industry. I have, a time or two, been compared to Hitler for eating meat; but again, this is a vocal minority.

**What Is This I Don't Even:** In real life, I have heard precisely 0 references to otherkin, therians, transethnicity, transautism, skoliosexuality, or other fake oppressed minorities. I have been accused of cultural appropriation for liking something of another culture exactly once. I have been told to ""check my privilege"" only a handful of times. I have literally heard more angry rants about the role of moist towelettes in society than I have heard angry rants about the kyriarchy (3 to 2, to be exact).

Sorry for the wall of text, I just thought it was worth talking about since I've seen a lot of posts on this subreddit talking about internet SJW issues as if these are common beliefs, and then taking it too far and unfairly lashing out against legitimate social issues. That being said, this subreddit is still a goddamn comedy goldmine, so keep doing your thing, just... you know, don't get too carried away."	t5_2vizz	True

And screams with rage at egalitarians or people who say that they aren't feminists, but believe in equality, because that MUST mean that they're evil evil misogynists? Well, I figured out this morning that that line of ""logic"" was mighty familiar. Allow me to show you:


Inquisition: The Catholic Church is the ONLY true church, and anyone who doesn't belong isn't a Christian and doesn't believe in God!

Reformers: We're not Catholic, but we believe in God and we are Christians.

Inquisition: NO YOU ARE NOT ONLY CATHOLICS ARE. IF YOU AREN'T CATHOLIC YOU LITERALLY HATE GOD AND ARE NOT CHRISTIAN AT ALL IN ANY WAY.

Reformers: That's not true, we DO believe in...

Inquisition: TO THE STAKE!!!

And now we compare this with feminism:

Feminists: Feminism is the ONLY true group standing for equality, and anyone who isn't a feminist isn't in favor of equality and wants to enslave women!

Egalitarians/other non-feminists: We're not feminists, but we believe in equality and want to see women and men get the same chances in life.

Feminists: NO YOU DO NOT ONLY FEMINISTS DO. IF YOU AREN'T A FEMINIST YOU LITERALLY HATE WOMEN AND DO NOT BELIEVE IN EQUALITY AT ALL.

Egalitarians/other non-feminists: That's not true, we DO support...

Feminism: OMG JUST KILL YOURSELVES ALREADY!!!

Self-posting because I wanted to put some context here. It's covered in the comments, but I wanted to elaborate.  

George Takei is Japanese-American. He was a child during WWII. In WWII, the American government forced people of Japanese descent (even if they were American citizens) into internment camps. Takei's family was, therefore, sent to an internment camp, and he has faced racism for being Japanese in his life. 

He is also gay. Taking these things into account, I would think that Takei has a better understanding of oppression than the vast majority of SJWs. 

But then he posts a funny graphic comparing a dress that Michelle Obama wore to a costume worn by a Star Trek character. Apparently that invalidates his life experiences and makes him an enemy of SJWs. "	t5_2vizz	True

For those of you who don't know mumsnet is a rather large UK website where middle class mummies go to talk about property prices and the latest organic food recipes. They also have a rather large feminist board with many a rad fem found therein. This means that regular middle class mums often come into contact with the Dworkin worshipers who think all sex is rape, and it's always fun to read!

They use lots of acronyms so here's a crash course.  
  
LTB = Leave The Bastard (quite concerning a relationships board would need an acronym for this)  
dh = dearest husband  
dp = dearest partner  
dd = dearest daughter  
ds = dearest son  
dc = dearest child  
  
  
This particular thread is in the relationships board. The [OP](http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/relationships/a1760920-Oh-my-god-I-am-going-to-fucking-kill-dh-His-fucking-porn-habit) is upset that her husband is watching porn despite the fact that she has voiced displeasure with him watching porn before. Fair enough you might say, this is a problem but not the sort of think you leave a 20 year relationship over. Not on mumsnet! We only get a few posts down before she's told she should [cheat on her husband](http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/relationships/a1760920-Oh-my-god-I-am-going-to-fucking-kill-dh-His-fucking-porn-habit#39203557).  
  
The whole thread is a great read I'm pretty sure OP is a troll. OP basically describes her husband as the perfect man, he has a great job, he works hard earns lots of money, is great with the kids, loves her, they have a good sex life, he's very considerate in bed, the whole package. But he looks at porn!!!!!!! So obviously, according to Mumsnetters, he's a dangerous pervert who shouldn't be around her kids!  
  
Here are some more posts where OP describes her husband.
[He's kind and considerate](http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/relationships/a1760920-Oh-my-god-I-am-going-to-fucking-kill-dh-His-fucking-porn-habit#39205200)  
[I'm very lucky he works so hard so I can be a stay at home mum](http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/relationships/a1760920-Oh-my-god-I-am-going-to-fucking-kill-dh-His-fucking-porn-habit#39205374)  
  
My favorite bit. Op [describes that her husband handles the finances in the relationship](http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/relationships/a1760920-Oh-my-god-I-am-going-to-fucking-kill-dh-His-fucking-porn-habit#39205519) and several posters decide that she is being [financially abused](http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/relationships/a1760920-Oh-my-god-I-am-going-to-fucking-kill-dh-His-fucking-porn-habit#39205532), before OP [posts](http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/relationships/a1760920-Oh-my-god-I-am-going-to-fucking-kill-dh-His-fucking-porn-habit#39212821) that actually he actually pays all the bills and gives her loads of money to do what she wants with, oh and [shes spent it all ran up a bunch of credit card debt and got a secret loan!](http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/relationships/a1760920-Oh-my-god-I-am-going-to-fucking-kill-dh-His-fucking-porn-habit#39205638) A bit worse than looking at some porn I think.  
  
Honestly the whole thread is pretty gold. There are a few people who turn up to say that porn is woman hating and that female porn stars are all trafficked rape victims. There are some posters who advise divorcing him, forcing him to pay for her lavish lifestyle and never letting him see his kids to punish him.    
  
Anyway not the normal tumblrinaction stuff, but I thought you guys might enjoy it.

You're not going to see this, and even if you did you'd just dismiss it because I'm not an almighty Latina like you. But I'm doing something you constantly tell everyone else to do, I'm ""collecting"" you. 

You are an empty-headed, immature little brat. 

You cling to your ""victim"" status, constantly throw out ""but I'm Latina!"" whenever you do something wrong. You are absolutely baffled when you get pushback after calling people racial slurs and discounting their experiences because it doesn't match up with what you know. 

If you've ever experienced legitimate oppression a day in your life, then I'm Bill Gates. *checks bank account, checks pants* And I'm broke, and not a dude, so I'm obviously not Bill Gates. 

You have no idea what actual oppression is. 

Actual oppression was my grandmother eating weeds to survive in the Soviet Union because of food shortages. 

Actual oppression is my neighbor fleeing Bosnia in the middle of the night, so that he wouldn't be killed in the middle of a genocide. You know, the same genocide you brushed off as ""white people fighting?"" 

Actual oppression was segregation here in America. You know, that thing Martin Luther King was fighting against?

Actual oppression was South African apartheid. 

Actual oppression is random Palestinian and Israeli kids getting blown up on their way to elementary school because of the conflicts between their two governments. 

Actual oppression was the comfort women, Chinese and Korean women who were forced to become prostitutes during WWII. 

Actual oppression is the situation in Darfur. 

I could go on. 

You? You're a spoiled little brat mooching off your mommy and daddy, attending school and clinging to your ethnicity like it's a life raft. There's nothing wrong with being proud of your heritage. But you're not proud of your heritage, you're using it as a weapon to beat people upside the head with. You speak almost no Spanish and know absolutely nothing about your own ancestral culture (hint: radical leftists kind of fucked Cuba over). 

You're a pathetic spoiled child who won't last a day in the working world. In fact, I kind of hope you get hired by my company. It would be hilarious to see your face, to realize that yes, people of all different races and nationalities can work together and get along just fine. But you'll never get a job unless you grow up.
