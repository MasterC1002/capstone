1345761045.0	ypynl	You guys do a good service :)	Altilana	100	18	8	"Because of this subreddit, I released a spider back out into the wild today instead of killing it. I've always been terrified of spiders, and about 2 years ago I decided to conquer my fear. One summer a spider must have laid eggs in my bed's canopy, because tiny baby spiders kept crazy out of my hair over the course of several days. Many tears were shed and I've spent many hours just staring at photos of spiders online. Still, I gave no second thought to squishing them. Actually I considered it a success, since before I would have to ask my dad or brother to kill it for me. After reading the post about how one man dealt with an infestation of wolf spiders, I decided that next time I found a spider I would resolve to be brave and send the sucker outside. Thanks guys for teaching me about the amazing creepy crawlers of this world, and helping me manage my fears. :)

I would have taken a photo, but it was an incredibly small spider and my camera would have rendered it into a pixelated blur.

Hey r/whatsthisbug,



Recently I did an [AMA](http://redd.it/n54v9) over on [/r/askscience](/r/askscience) and several people asked me how they could get better at identifying insects in and around the home. One person in particular suggested I start a short class over on /r/UniversityofReddit to teach the basics of not only insect identification, but entomology in general. I've been thinking about it ever since and I wanted to run the idea by you guys, seeing as you're inherently the ones most interested in the subject. The idea is this: we would have a running series of presentations focusing on family-level identification and information, each one focusing on a different order of insect. At the end of each presentation, there would be a short sight ID ""quiz"" where we could go over the process of identifying the specimens we talked about. If there's enough people, I'd be willing to throw in a prize near the end for the highest scores!

I think it would be a great opportunity to get the community involved and try to make a positive impact (...and maybe lessen the number of ""IS THIS A BEDBUG?!?"" posts we get...)
The resources provided by /r/UniversityofReddit are quite substantial and would provide us with not only Mumble/Vent servers to for discussion, but personalized messaging systems to keep everyone informed and organized.

Joseph_P_Brenner	58	3	7	"So I just found out from our CSS wizard, Tsssss, that after adding all the many different reminders to read our sidebar/guidelines, and ESPECIALLY to provide geographic location, there will still be a population who will not see these reminders:

1. Those who disable custom styles in their reddit preferences won't experience our skinning.
2. Those who disable custom styles with RES won't experience our skinning.
3. Those who use the mobile version of reddit won't even see a sidebar!

Going forward, submissions that do not adhere to our guidelines (e.g. are missing geographic location), will be given the benefit of the doubt and will not be removed.  If you see a submission missing the geographic location, please ask the submitter to provide.  **We apologize if you were part of the above 3 populations and we removed your submission!**  Given how quickly submissions drop off the our front page, feel free to resubmit your bug for identification.

As usual though, when we ask why you did not provide geographic location and whether you saw our reminders, we take your answer seriously, as it tells us how we can improve.  If you do not communicate, we will never know!

It is potentially vital to learn the common ID for the poisonous critters in your area! Usually you can count the deadly/necrotic ones on a single hand, so it really isn't much to learn. (Sorry, Australians.)

The point is, if you are walking along and your kid or pet starts going for a snake or a spider, you don't have time to snap an iphone pic and post it to this subreddit. You need to know if what just bit your self or someone you care about is a threat, or just slightly annoying.

So, take a moment, google ""Your area+poisonous creatures"". Spending 5 minutes of your time on this can help you and all the harmless creatures that get smooshed in case they are poisonous. Take a moment to get the knowledge to potentially save a life, whether it is yours or a common house spider's."	t5_2s3bw	True
