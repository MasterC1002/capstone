1349846711.0	118lpa	The sum of all FIFA	Boomslang00	154	14	22	"Im playing ultimate team.15 points in the bank and have 1 game until the season is over. In Division II, 17 points earns you the title, so one more victory and I am bathing in 10k coinage. I get matched up against an EPL team with Kun Aguero, Hernandez from Man U, and Hart in goal. The entire team is rare players, good looking squad, way better on paper than my poor BBVA team. This game quickly becomes **the** most intense game of FIFA I have ever played **period**. He is just wide of the post every shot, I keep hitting the keeper, multiple multiple corners for both of us the whole game, no disastrous mistakes from either of us. The end of the match approaches, 80' and he has the ball, passing like a monster. If I get the ball back, I have to make it count. Finally, I obtain possession at 88' and break down field. Two, three good passes, then an outstanding through ball right into Negrado's feet at the top of the box (82 ST Sevilla). 

I take my first touch in slow motion and my heart stops beating. I'm just playing FIFA, but some teenage boy in Wisconson is closing 15 tabs of porn. My thumb moves to press the shot button, all time stops. A mother is giving birth to her first child in Beijing, as an old man dies just down the hall, a plane in Germany is delayed for take off, the pilot must use the restroom, a small boy in Mexico City falls asleep watching Finding Nemo with spanish subtitles, some man somewhere is waking up to what will be his best day ever just as his counter part gets home from what was surely his absolute worst. Time reboots and begins again. The shot hits the post as a bong shatters into 100 pieces due to a clumsy hand off somewhere in Houston. The rebound lands right before Jose Antonio Reyes (81 LW Sevilla), a quick left - right - SHOOT!!!....and the ball goes into the back of the net, 89th minute!!!! An asteroid, carrying microbial life, collides with a silent, barren planet. An alien civilization, unfathomably distant from us, just achieved world peace. A tear rolls down the cheek of God and disappears inside a super massive black hole. And me? I am victorious...victorious at last.

Then the internet disconnects...all gone.

The path that led to the creation of this subreddit has been a winding one, but I think a good start is a fresh start. Let's leave all the drama behind as we move forward, alright? We as a community will benefit from a solid base of users who want a permanent home for all things related to EA Sports' FIFA series. Everything else will just come along with it.

1. **Userflair is activated in this subreddit.** Look to the sidebar for the EDIT option next to your reddit username. Choose your console icon, enter your Gamertag or User ID,  and then hit SAVE. *Boom*. You are now easily identifiable between reddit and your system. No need to constantly tell people how to find you online or what specific system you're on. Put a ""-"" in for the ID if you'd rather only share your system.

2. **The rule is there are no rules.** Well, not really. I prefer a community to be run by it's community. Don't downvote posts or comments based on your personal opinions or hatred, but it's perfectly okay to reward the good posts with karma and to ignore the posts that suck. You then teach others what the community wants, you dig? If something is way out of line, hit the REPORT button.

3. **If you start the chant, this section will be rocking.**  Many people gave up thinking there'd ever be an all-inclusive place for FIFA news and tactics on reddit who might appreciate the notice that we now exist. Don't spam subs with posts, but don't be afraid to name drop the community in the comments when discussing related topics. You'd be surprised how far one link drop in a comment will go in gathering the ultimate team we're going to gather here. 

4. **True leaders lead on the field, not the bench** Most of the work for the subreddit as far as moderation goes is now complete. It's the content and activity in the sub, especially during these first few weeks, that what will bring others to gather here. If you find good content, post good content. If you posted something elsewhere, you can post it again here -- just don't steal someone else's submission without proper credit. If you got a question about the game, let's have a conversation about it in a self-post. Tips, Tricks, Videos, Questions, News, Xbox360, PS3, FIFA 94 to FIFA 13 and beyond, it's all welcome here.

This community is now yours. **Â¡Vamos FIFA!**"	t5_2uh1s	True

1374252897.0	1in3bo	[ANNOUNCEMENT] On Merging FIFA Subreddits...	shane_solo	75	9	51	"

As many of you know, we started /r/EA_FIFA about a year ago because there were complaints regarding the state of /r/FIFA and the endless migration of the ""numbered"" FIFA subreddits. Most of us just wanted ONE subreddit for all things FIFA, something that was a bit more organized and focused that we could establish a real community around. 

At the time, the moderators of /r/FIFA couldn't make that happen -- so we made it happen ourselves. 

When we pulled the trigger on it, there was a lot of uncertainty about whether or not it would even work. And yes, there's the idea that it actually made things worse because we went from 2 main subs to 3. But a year and 3600+ players later, it's clear to me that the grand experiment was a successful one, despite any of the problems it caused. 

I'm not going to lie -- /r/EA_FIFA is the best FIFA community on reddit and that's YOUR fault. Even if you point out some of the things that I've done to assist you, I mostly follow YOUR lead. It's sort of how I feel a moderator should work, ya know?

That's why I'm going to to follow your lead on this next proposal. 

As you've probably noticed, there's been another wave of ""Why don't we just merge with /r/FIFA?"" threads, including a couple of polls and discussions on their results. You may have also noticed that I didn't really say anything about it. This is because I was trying to get a sense of what YOU thought and what main subscribers of /r/FIFA thought. I'll be honest though, I really appreciated your loyalty. A lot of nice things were said about me and what we've created here and believe me, I took note of all that was said.

So...

*Those* conversations led to /u/criminolelawyer (the top moderator of /r/FIFA) approaching me to seriously consider what we could do about ending this rift. Him and I weren't able to solve this thing a year ago, but he's always been in support of the idea of having a single subreddit for FIFA, and did what he could to support r/EA_FIFA when moderators above him wouldn't make up their minds regarding the direction of r/FIFA.

But now he's the top moderator and we've been collaborating on the best case scenario for our subreddits, mainly this idea that ""/r/EA_FIFA is the better subreddit, but /r/FIFA is the better name..."" It makes complete sense that we should merge the communities. It couldn't happen before because the creator of /r/FIFA had different ideas. But his leaving and the success of /r/EA_FIFA and it's evolution as an all-inclusive FIFA community means that this option is possible.

What we've come to agree on is that we should simply follow what's been said. If /r/EA_FIFA is the better community and /r/FIFA is the better name, then we literally bring all that is /r/EA_FIFA to /r/FIFA.

*Our CSS Style and Sidebar Content becomes theirs...*

*Our Flair and FUT Filter becomes theirs...*

*Our Moderator becomes theirs...*

The basic proposal is, I would take over /r/FIFA as the top moderator and we would eventually shut down /r/EA_FIFA in favor of merging all of us into one community. Everything we have here, we would continue to have under a new name and therefore acccomplish all that we were hoping to make happen a year ago. In merging the subreddits, /u/criminolelawyer would stay on and lead a lot of the community aspects of the sub. That's where his strengths lie, and I think having a healthy community that isn't so spread out will allow for us to do a lot more in organizing events and contests that end up making the subreddit more than just our Rage Against The Sweat. 

Most of the recent polling data is consistent with this being the best idea for both communities, but I told /u/criminolelawyer that I wouldn't make a drastic change like this without getting feedback from you directly. It's YOUR community, after all.

So, what say you?

I can also answer any questions you have regarding this idea. It's still just a proposal, but one that I'd like to execute in the very near future if we can all agree on it.

**tl;dr This is the creator of /r/EA_FIFA  proposing that we take all that we have here and bring it to /r/FIFA, eventually shutting /r/EA_FIFA down to help eliminate multiple subreddits for the same game. The CSS Style, Flair, and FUT Filter of /r/EA_FIFA would be implemented in /r/FIFA when this moderator becomes their top moderator.**"	t5_2uh1s	True

foreign guys who picked bvb and I picked psg

the build I got to play was 65% complete what ever that means, my first impression is that it is a slower game. From the what I played I can tell you that pace abusing is completely not in this game, time and time again I got a break away and would y pass the ball to Lucas only to be caught by Subotic over and over.

Containing Ai is completely different you can't just hold A/X and wait for your defender to get close enough to make a move on his own, You can hold contain to get close but once you get close enough you have to engage or your player will just back track.

Skill moves were changed but I didn't really work out how, something about not having to hold the modifier down while moving the right stick but im not sure I did pull off a mcgeady spin with Ibra but I'm not sure if I was holding LT/L2 or not.

Also there was something about if you are holding sprint before your player has the ball he will take a long touch and place the ball ahead of him or something.

Over all I can say the game felt sluggish compared to fifa 13 the passing and defending was pretty fluid but sprinting with the ball will get some time to get used to.

1362771336.0	19xfs1	EA_FIFA Quick tips thread. Simple things to help you become a better player	RyanSammy	62	8	38	"I've played FIFA since '06, and while I'm no God, there are several things I do that help a lot. Be sure to add your tips in the comments and I'll add them here.

* When you are one on one with your opponent's goalkeeper, keep calm. When they keep their goalie on the line, scoring is super easy. The way I find most effective is aiming for the near post and shooting with as little power as possible. You'll be amazed at how effective this is. Sometimes I'll aim for the far post, but I will still use as little power as possible.

* When your opponent is one on one with your goalkeeper, there are two options. Option one is to bring your keeper out, option two is to bring your keeper out halfway and then run back, tricking your opponent into trying a chip shot or shooting too early. Like I mentioned earlier, scoring when the keeper is on his line is super easy. This has saved my ass so many times. 

* Often, when your opponent tries a through ball and is racing your defender to get there first, I will bring my keeper out and jockey with my defender blocking the attacker off. His attacker will struggle to get past my defender and my goalie will pick up the ball or just boot it.

* Get used to having player switching on air balls only Auto is crappy. It may seem hard, at first but manual switching is necessary to be an effective defender. An effective defending tactic is using the second man press to cover the attacker while you control another player and use him to mark the main passing option.

* Keep your defenders back and try to tackle the opponent with your midfielders. Using your midfielders to tackle means that your defenders stay in position and through balls are less effective. If you come rushing out with a CB, you'll have a massive hole in your defence and all your opponent needs to do is a lobbed through ball and he is one on one with your keeper. Don't do this. If you come rushing out with one of your fullbacks, your opponent will end up with tons of space down the wings for Biabiany and Walcott to abuse.

* Dont sprint all the time. Rarely should you sprint in your own half or in the middle of the pitch. Only sprint when there are no defenders in front of you. You are really easy to tackle while sprinting, but when I just dribble around with Ben Arfa or Robinho I'm almost invincible.

* Skill moves are very effective when used correctly. The step-over is very effective and all players can do it. The roulette is a great 3* skill move. The Ronaldo chop, running scoop turn, and McGeady spin are good as well

* In any formation without a CDM, it is generally good to have at least one CM with Medium/low attacking and high defensive workrates. Examples: Yaya Toure, De Rossi (my personal favourite), Luiz Gustavo, Xabi Alonso, Tiote and Fellaini.

* Don't go diving in with tackles. I usually jockey to tackle, because if you attempt a slide/standing tackle and fail, there is a large chance of your opponent being able to go through on goal.

* When in doubt, boot it out. Doing the things the Arsenal way and passing around your defence instead of booting it out can be risky.

* Don't be afraid to pass back to your goalkeeper when under pressure. On the ground though, lobbed balls can result in an own goal. Tip from /u/eerhtmot

* One that I would add is to be sure to use L2 when receiving passes under defensive pressure. Trapping the ball lets you change direction quickly and if they are charging at you you can often get past defenders and get scoring opportunities in this way. (Tip from /u/pjc101)

* One tip that always helps me is to call a second defender while manually switching to another defender to intercept the pass. The opponent will be pressured by the second defender and be forced to pass and it really helps a lot. Also when attacking, don't be afraid to pass it around the 18 yard box until you find an opening to either dribble through or pass to. And I find when shooting that powered shots have a much greater chance of going in than finesse shots (near post is super OP in this game). tip from /u/SweatyHeskey

* In Ultimate Team individual chemistry is more important than Overall chemistry. Temporarily remove your manager, if your chemistry is 99 than your team is perfect. If it is less than 99 see which player is on less than 9 chemistry and  fix this. You may need to purchase a formation or position card.

* Morale is almost as important as chemistry and has a major influence on how well your team plays. Whenever I build a new team I always apply a squad morale card. They only cost around 500 coins.

* Set custom tactics. I have 4, one for when I am playing normaly, On for when I am down and need to score quickly (High pressure and High attack speed), One for when I am winning (More possession in attacking build up, looser defense), and one for the pacy counter attack teams (Deeeeep defense, Counter attacking with long balls and quick build up). Tip by /u/ThaMastaBlasta

* Play defence with a midfielder, not a CB/LB/RB. It's important to keep your back line intact lest you leave a gaping whole in the back. Tip by /u/dwaters11

* One thing that helps me out when I'm playing well is low powered through passes (pretty much just tap the button) when in tight spaces in your opponents third, as well as during counter attacks.
Also, instead of using low crosses, I use a well powered through balls. Often times there is at least one of my players ust on/outside the box who's completely free and can take advantage of these types of passes. Tip by /u/TheBearOfBadNews

* The double tap shot all the way for me. Sneaks under keepers dives so often and goes in with little power. Tip by /u/plewes37

* When playing against good defensive players/World Class or Legendary CPU, be patient in attack. A lot of people seem to force the ball forward and always go for the counter, which, trust me, is very easy to defend for an experienced player.
Keep possession, don't be afraid to make sideways and back passes. Spread it around. Make sure all of your attacking players get some time on the ball as to keep their individual ratings/morale up. Vary your attacks, if you notice you've been trying to force it up one side with no success, then try the other flank or go for a slow build-up through the middle. Use as much of the field as you can. It doesn't matter what team you're using or who you're playing, as long as you do these things gaps will eventually open. Tip by /u/ASS_IN_MY_PISS 

* If you want to actually score when someone brings their keeper out, finesse it around the GK. It works really, really well. I see so many people just going for the chip because it looks nice, but trust me, finesse it around the keeper if you have your LM/RM/CAM/ST through in the 1on1 situation. Tip by /u/henkizh

* Practice switching the play. Sometimes when play is focused on one side of the field for a while and you're running out of space, a strong horizontal pass with R1+Lob could help. The other side will generally have quite a bit of space to launch an attack. Tip by /u/kiwitiger

* Look for passing triangles. It's the simplest piece of advice but it's something that a lot of people neglect. Tip by /u/Yaki304

* Here's one tip I think will help everyone. Keep your eye on the field for passes when the opponent is backing off a bit, but if the opponent is pressuring you on the ball (ie sprinting to everyone who receives a pass), then just stare intently at your player with the ball until you get past the defender, then go back and look for passing lanes.
Also, if a pass is there, just make it. Even if the pass doesn't result in a chance on goal, even a switch from the left side of the field to the middle of the field can chance. If you have the ball with your wingers, don't just either sprint down the wing or cut in. Use them as attacking mids sometimes, bring them central from deep in the midfield and let the CAMs take their position to bring a different look to the defenders. Tip by /u/bemerktaufdeutsch

* When taking a header from a cross/corner, tap the shoot button as quickly as possible. I've overpowered many a header, and I've never under powered one, so really, as quickly as possible. Also make sure to hold L2/LT and jockey for position before jumping, and just press shoot right as you'd want the player to jump. Tip by /u/Rauxbaught

* EA is cheap and doesn't include an instruction booklet with controls. Find it here: http://www.ea.com/soccer/manuals/fifa13
Don't underestimate the usefulness of figuring out all of the default controls. Tip by /u/tron-

* Hitting a trailer with a bouncing cross (triple tap square) when you are running out of space from the outside has scored me tons and tons of goals in both online and offline play.
Try to play one step ahead of your opponent on offense if you like to pass the ball around. As soon as you decide on a pass and hit the button, look for the receiving player's passing options immediately. Simple one-twos can absolutely shred an aggressive defense (which tends to happen quite a bit on FUT)
An add on to the last one: The game almost never allows you to play two through balls in a row if you are trying to pass your way up the field. Ground pass until you see a low-risk through ball, don't force it.
One final tip: Use the radar! It's crazy to me how many of my friends that I play with never even notice it's there. Incredibly important for trying to play long through balls, switching balls to flanks, goal kicks, etc. Tip by /u/djp4516

* My tip would be don't be afraid to stop. Completely stopping, or at least slowing down to an L2/LB crawl can really mess about with opponents. They'll often run a defender right past you, or miss a tackle. This is expecially good with players with good control, and makes getting past defenders super easy. Tip by /u/potpan0

* A simple ball roll at the right time when the keeper is rushing out to grab the ball from your feet will put you past him 99% of the time. Tip by /u/thedouglerr

1. On goal kicks try to kick it to your LB/RB by using about two bars of power. It is a safer place to kick the goal kick so it doesn't come right back at you!
2. Double tap shoot when a goalie is rushing your player in a 1 on 1. Most of the time it will roll right by the GK!
3. On corners aim as far toward the goal as you can, then hold up+away from the goal and use 2.25 bars. Use a lefty for one side and a Righty for the other (so they're always kicking away from the goal). It will always land right in front and won't give your opponent a chance to defend. Hold L2 and push shoot early for a chance to score!
4. Bring the extra player over on a corner and pass to them, then dribble along the touch line and cross. Your players will still be in position to head it in but the cross will come from much closer, making it easier to score. Alternate this with #3 and your corners are tough to predict. 
5. Look for players that are almost behind the defense on free kicks in your own half. Hold up while you use 4-4.5 bars and start running toward the ball as soon as you kick it. With fast players you can get a 1 on 1 from this situation. 
6. When your opponent has a 1 on 1 pull your keeper out a couple of steps to spook the other player then tap triangle again to send him back.  With finesse shots so much weaker this year you don't have to worry as much about the player curling it around your keeper and you will save more shots or make them pass/shoot early.

Here's how it would work, you could drop into a random match or find a group of friends. You could select your online pro or an existing player. Then all of your players spawn in the arena in front of the net with a keeper.  The ball gets played in and it's basically a free for all to see who scores. When you score you step aside and wait for everyone else to score. Whoever doesn't score is eliminated. Repeat this process until you have a winner.

1348978421.0	10p5ic	The communtiy trading guide of FUT 13	theholesdamnshow	48	7	20	"**This thread is intended to be a community guide, and any suggestions deemed to be useful for the community and thread, I will gladly put in.**

**Before you trade:** Before you trade, you should have two things in mind. Firstly, you should know how much profit you are attempting to make. If you have this, you won't be frustrated when you're sitting down for X hours, with no real goal. Secondly, have a technique in mind that you hope to use. Don't go in just hoping you stumble upon a good deal. Know what technique you are using, and base what technique you use around profit intended, time and coins on hand. Now to the first technique.

**The lazy mans trade:** When first learning to trade, this technique is useful as it requires little to no knowledge of the market. This technique entails searching for gold players with a minimum price of 650 and a max of 700 in either 4-4-2, 4-1-2-1-2 or 4-3-3.  Once you have the results up, bid on any rare player above 60 pace. Then, once all the players you have bid on ends, and you have say 5 players either search them on the market and find the cheapest BIN in that formation and undercut it, or make an educated guess. In one session, this technique can return 2-4k on average, requires only about 8k to use and is very simple. This is useful for a new player to FUT.

**Micro Trading:** This technique is relatively simple. Find a player that costs between 4k-6.5k BIN cheapest. Then search for that player in any formation undercutting that BIN by about 1.5k, and bid on as many players you can, and leave it in the hope you got two or three. The idea of this technique is that since you have bidded on say ten copies of a player, odds suggest you'll get one of them, and when you get it, you can put it up slightly below the average BIN for a relatively easy 1.5k profit. Again, this an easy, basic technique, that takes little time, can return good profits (about 4k-8k depending on how lucky you get) and takes only little knowledge of one or two players. The biggest downfall of this technique is that it requires 25k-30k to use, so if you are able to get to that money, this technique is for you.

**Macro Trading:** This technique is the complete opposite of the previous technique. In this technique, you will search for an expensive player (about 30k). Pick one player, and go onto the [database](http://www.ultimatedb.nl), and find this payers average price. Then search for either a BIN or open bid, (prefferably a BIN) and hope to find a good bid. The advantage of this technique is that it can give some fantastic returns. In the past I have made 30k profits off one deal after sitting down for 10 minutes. On the flispside though, this technique can provide little to nothing on some days, even thoug you have been there for two hours. This technique as well requires about 40k to be able to afford any player, so this is not a starter technique.

**Niche trading:** This technique is all about understanding a specific demand, e.g skills. When niche trading, find a league that you are able to search for and recognise a good deal on the front page. This is an advanced technique, but if done correctly can turn over huge profits, simply because of your knowledge of the market, and your ability to pick a good deal with anyone. You will need extreme understanding of the market to do this technique, but is easy and unstrenuous once you do understand it.

**Investing:** This techniques name says it all. Invest in a player, and hope he becomes expensive. An example of how you can use this can be seen in El Shaarawy in FUT 12. AT the start he was worth 15k or so, but when youtubers started using him and he got publicity, his price became ridiculous. The same can be said for anyone used in KSI's beast videos. They were cheap, then became expensive because of publicity. The only way to plan for these are to buy some relatively good silvers, maybe with 5 star skill and hope there price shoots up for some reason (probably publicity).

1365363813.0	1bvajj	Game Tip: How Not Beat Yourself With Goal Kicks	crocajun1003	48	10	37	"After playing for a long time in Div 1, I recently had an issue with my XBL account that forced me to start back over in Div 10. This trek back up the Fifa ranks gave me the opportunity to observe the different playing styles and ability levels of players in different divisions. What I found was that the two MAJOR differences between Div 1 players and Div 3-5 players are:

* 1. Clinical finishing
* 2. Not Beating Yourself

One of the big ways players tend to beat themselves is on Goal Kicks. In this tip, I'll explain why Goal Kicks are so important, and break down exactly what to do on offense and defense to make Goal Kicks a strength rather than a weakness in your game. 
________________
The goal kick may be the closest thing to a positioning ""glitch"" in Fifa 13 as it puts the team taking the kick at such a disadvantage. So much can go wrong. If the kicker attempts to pass to one of the CBs or FBs at the edge of the box, a quick forward can intercept and create an immediate scoring opportunity. If the kicker attempts to boot it up field, there is often a mismatch between the kicking team's smaller attackers and the team defending's bigger, stronger CBs. This can lead to a quick counter with a powerful header from a CB to a forward leaving the team that took the kick's defense out of position and chasing. These against the run-of-play scoring chances can change the game and should always be avoided. 

So what do you do on a goal kick to maintain possession and avoid easy giveaways? Here's what most of the top Div. 1 players I've seen do. 

Chip it to the full back. That's it. Don't boot it. NEVER pass it along the ground. Chip it to the full back. If your taking the goal kick from the right side, chip it to the RB on the right sideline. If you're on the left side, chip it to the left back. 

This method has proven to be the best way to maintain possession off a goal kick without the potential of giving up scoring chances. The chipped pass is much tougher for the defending team to cleanly intercept and create a shot, and if it is intercepted, the chip allows your defenders time to get back into position and defend. 

If your opponent decides to defend the fullback, you can play the fullback open by how hard you hit the chip. 2 bars power will put the ball over the fullbacks head, allowing him to run on to it. 1 bar power will put it in front of the fullback. If you feel especially threatened, put 3 bars power and just kick it out of bounds. 

On the other hand, if you are the team defending the goal kick -- ALWAYS be proactive. Make sure if the kicker attempts to make the short pass to his CB you'll have a player there to intercept and quickly convert. If the kicker tries to chip it to his outside back, have a player out there harassing. 

Fifa 13 can be a tough game with often small details determining the difference between winning and losing, promotion and relegation. Using this goal kick tip will help you avoid giving up easy goals while cashing in a few of your own, helping you get that much closer to that elusive League Title. 

(Let me know what you think. Have some extra advice? Please share. Got a criticism? Let's hear it, but don't just say, ""this is stupid"". Tell us why it's stupid so that we can all get better.)

Since this has got some popularity and people have been adding on to what I have I'll be reformatting and adding in details from other posters.

***Intro***

Due to the popularity of the weekly thread (which can be found on the sidebar and banner at the top) and the fact that we **still** get tons of posts asking to build teams, complete teams, etc I've decided just to type up an overview of the process I go through when creating my own team or helping others. It is my goal to have this help people get started with building their own squads and I hope others will chime in and correct me or add to what I say. 

It has become tiresome and annoying to see people posting in the weekly thread with no preferences what so ever other than a budget. It's important for you to pick a formation you're comfortable with or a league you think you will enjoy playing in order to get the most 'fun' out of FUT. And no, saying '5 star skillers' or 'longshots' doesn't really work. If that is your only requirement [you can search for squads here](http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/search/hot-today/).

In addition to www.futhead.com another site with an active member in our community (JuicyORiley) has been working on is www.futwiz.com . I personally started FUT using futhead so that's what I use but songs of praise have been sung for both sites, so take your pick!

*Now to the good part!*


***Budget***

You should start off with knowing how much you plan to spend on this team so you can better assess your options. If you don't know how much you're willing to spend you don't know what type of team you can plan for. Keep in mind formations influence the cost of a player.


A piece of advice for new players looking to expand their budget from **Zikerz**:

&gt;When i offer advice to any new FUT player ever, i always start with suggesting they spend EA coins in the EA catalog to get more FUT coins per game. Then they should play one or two seasons against the CPU since it is set to easy in the first 2 or 3 divisions. This will get you a little exp playing with a sub par team ( since you start with a bronze team) yet you can still easily win. This also starts you with TONS of gold if you are of decent level.


***Picking a nation/league***

Next thing for me, and I think should be for you, is deciding what league/nationality. I often make the decision when I play against or find a player I really like and build a team around him. This year I've had BPL, Bundesliga, Russian League, SPL, BBVA, Serie A, and Ligue 1 teams. Almost any league can be competitive! As an example of diversity the [highest rated team on futhead](http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/137601/) is a powerhouse silver team.


***Browsing available players***

After I settle on a nation/league I go through using the [player search function](http://www.futhead.com/fifa/players/) with filters on the nationality/league I picked and look at all the positions one by one. This gives me a sense of strong and weak points in the nation/league and I can better pick a formation. For example, if I'm thinking of making certain team but the only right back in my budget is a 63 rated RB with 20 pace, I'll probably want to use a 3 atb (at the back) back formation.

***Deciding on a formation***

Now that you have an overview of all the available players it's time to pick a formation. I mostly go with experience here. Having played FIFA religiously since 07 I've tried almost all of them and know which fit my play style. As mentioned before, you may be limited by available players here. It's important to note that your dream of a 4-1-2-1-2 team might be limited by the previous example of a terrible RB. I do not recommend just picking one that fits or won't get full chem. Just pick a different formation or nation/league. Don't be afraid to try out new formation however! If you're trying one for the first time I suggest getting lower tier players for cheap and seeing how it works out for you. Then you can upgrade to your desired players without possibly taking a big loss when having to resell for a different formation.

***Filling out the roster***

Now that you have your nation/league and formation you can start using the squad creator to fill out your team. While doing this it can be beneficial to look for possible areas to hybridize by looking for popular nations or teams to provide links with. Perfect chem is same team same nation. In order to get chemistry your players need to either be in the same league or from the same nation. A tip for hybridizing is to have a cluster of the same people from the same team to boost chem. For example you could use Man City on the left side of a defense with Clichy/Kompany/Hart and the right side be Bayern Munich with Lahm/Boateng/Schweinstager at CDM. I'm not 100% sure that comes out to full chem...don't take my word for that particular set up.

Since my explanation is pretty bad, here's **teutonic** with a better explanation of chemistry:

&gt;I think to seriously have a squad building 101, you need to at least mention how chemistry works!
Making hybrids is very easy once you understand the system. To get a player on 9 chemistry, you need to have all of that player's links full. They can have dead links, but the total must be greater or equal to the requirement. Having extra links also makes it possible to put players in the wrong positions at 9 chem (eg RWB @ RM).
There are 3 different links that a player can have; league, team and nationality. League links give 1 point, where as team and nationality give 1.5 each. These links stack, here are some examples:

&gt;Koscielny and David Luiz = 1 point (league)

&gt;Koscielny and Mangala = 1.5 points (nation)

&gt;Koscielny and Kaboul = 2.5 points (league+nation)

&gt;Arteta and Wilshere = 2.5 points (league+team)

&gt;Arteta and Cazorla = 4 points (league+nation+team)

&gt;Those are the 5 different combinations. If you look at [this team] (http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/4974671/), you can see I make use of these different links to get everyone on 9 chem.

Another addition from **teutonic**

&gt;Well each link a player has with another player, they need to have that many chemistry points in order to get 9 chem. For example, the CAM in the 352 has 6 links, so he needs to get a minimum of 6 chemistry points from those 6 links.


***A run through of the process***

Here's an example of a [team I built](http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/5139420/) and I'll run you through my thought process. I started with wanting to build a team with Robben, Assaidi and Ox. I went with a 3-4-2-1 because Robben probably plays best at RF and it would allow me to have both Assaidi and Ox. I recognized my budget would be almost totally engulfed by Robben so I just exclude his price when planning the team.

I usually start at the top when making a team so I needed to find a link for Assaidi and Robben. To do this I needed either a Dutch player in the BPL or a Moroccan player in the Bundesliga. RvP was the obvious choice here but for less obvious choices or if you're just beginning use the player search function with the mentioned filters.

The next order of business was to get Robben to 9 chem. This was easily done as all of the positions he links to only needed to provide partial chem, ie all Bundesliga. The same thinking goes for Assaidi. All of the people he links to give partial chem.

Now for the hard part, rounding out the team. Finding a fit for the LCM position was tough because of the two dead links they are going to get from the right side. Wilshere is in there because he gets perfect chem with Ox and strong chem from Kos, keeping that Arsenal trio all at 9 chem. I knew I wanted Gundogan in there because I've used him previously and he was fantastic but I also knew the middle CB I was going to use had two dead links coming from the left. I stuck Boateng+Neuer there for perfect chem, and Santana at RCB to give Gundogan another strong link which completes the team.

Now that all players have 9 chem the team is successfully built. But the team is also pretty expensive so a way to cut the cost would be have Hummels at MCB (for perfect chem with Gundogan), Boateng at RCB, and using a cheaper keeper such as Weidenfeller or Wiese.

**Some futhead goodness**

I personally use futhead for my squad building purposes as it is what I am most comfortable. Aside from what has already been said there are some other cool features to use.

Most of the comments are annoying and irrelevant to how the players actually play in game. This is where the 'User Review' tab can come in handy ([example](http://www.futhead.com/fifa/players/202/reviews/)). These are long, more in depth review of the player than there is in the comments.

The 'Similar Players' tab is also extremely [helpful](http://www.futhead.com/fifa/players/202/similar/). From here you can find alternate players from the same league or the same nation which can help in hybridizing.

Lastly, the links in the Squad Creator function. You may notice when you start with a blank slate that there are red lines connecting the positions. These lines indicate a need for chemistry. As an example, the striker would not be affected chemistry wise by a center back or goalkeeper.

**Chemistry Manipulation**

As **Asco88** mentioned you can adjust your team in game while still getting full chemistry benefits. If you started with 100 chem of course.

For an expensive example of this I'll use the Bayern duo Robbery. So you want to use Ribery and Robben in a 4-2-3-1 because they are perfect for it, right? ""Wrong, fuck you!"" says EA. EA has designated the wingers to actually be CAM positions. That means that you can't put Robbery or any other real winger combo in those positions and get 9 chem. Does that mean you can't use Robbery in a 4-2-3-1 while getting full chem? Of course not. Eat shit, EA!

You will however need to use 2 of your 3 allotted subs in game. Enter the game with a full chem 4-2-3-1 squad with random CAMs (use bronze players for all I care). First touch you get on the ball pause and sub in Robben and Ribery on their respective sides at the ""CAM"" position. Because you had full chem to start with any subs will take on the chem of the squad so even at CAM Robbery will get the full stat boosts.

**Asco88** also adds:

&gt;Oh, and one more thing:

&gt;Card stats are deceptive - They are (weighted) averages over a number of in-game stats that may not have much to do with what you want out of a player.

&gt;For an extreme example, In-form Kolarov has 97 long shots and 99 shot power, but his card stat 'shooting' is 76, because his finishing is low. (Those stats look good for a CDM, huh? Remember you can sub him on or move him from LB to CDM in game.)

**In conclusion:**

There is no magic to use here. The people that are giving suggestions in the mega-thread didn't just magically learn all of the players in the game. It can take some time and practice to recognize what players would work where. I'm not sure if I accomplished what I was trying to do here but all suggestions/additions are welcome."	t5_2uh1s	True

**4-4-2:** The 4-4-2 is the simplest of fomations. For a new player, it is perfect due to its balance in attack, defence and counter attack potential. It's biggest and downfalls are that, firstly, if you have attacking minded mids with low defensive workrates, it can quickly turn into a 4-1-5, and that you usually require relatively pacey forwards, and if that just isn't your playstyle (pace abuse) it is tough to play fluidly.

**4-4-1-1:** Identical to the 4-4-2, other than the fact that the deeper lying CF provides a great position to play through balls, or take longshots.

**4-3-3:** The 4-3-3 is a simple formation. Mids with good passing, pace on the wings, striker with good heading. Really, all you need to do is push the ball out to your RW/LW and feed the ball in to a striker, and sooner or later you'll put a header past the keeper. The only downfall of this formation is that you can be overwhelmed in the mids against 4 or 5 mid formations.

**4-3-2-1:** Almost identical to the 4-3-3, but with the LF/RF, it is easier to cut in and shoot, givving you a situation with almost 3 strikers, while still giving you the width you get with a 3 upfront formation.

**4-1-2-1-2:** Probably the most favoured formation, it is favoured simply because the flaws are so minimal in the gameplay. With two up front, width in the mids, while still having two central mids sitting further up and further down the pitch, it is hard to play against. The biggest setback of this formation is that, it will put you back serious coinage, especially on more expensive players. Even cheaper players can cost up to 5k more in formation. If you are willing to spend an extra 50k or so on a team, this is the formation for you.

**4-2-3-1:** Similar to the 4-1-2-1-2, it has good depth in the mids, but has little to no width. It is widley debated at how good this formation is, as some love it and some hate it. It's best feature IMO is the ability to cut in and blast fromn distance with the CAM's, like the 4-2-2-2.

**4-2-2-2:** With 4 central mids and two strikers, this formation is perfect for blaying great balls over the top or through the defense, as well as being able to cut in with the CAM's and blasting from distance. Again, its downfall is lack of width, which can be a let down for players of a certain style.

**4-3-1-2:** This formation, if used correctly can be the most frustrating on FIFA to play against. With basicallhy 3 Strikers, 3 mids and 4 at the back, you can push wide with your CF to cross, play quick counter attacks with your 3 mids, or just hold it on the edge of the bx and shoot when you find space with all your attacking options. It really only lets you down on how fast it turns defense to attack if you don't get it out of your mids quickly.

**4-5-1:** Pretty simple. If you don't mind not being able to 1-2 pace abuse with two strikers, this is perfect. You can overload the other players mids with 5 in the mids, and the striker always has someone to feed off. The problem is simply, that, with so many pace abusers, a 5 mid formation doesn't suit there playstyle, as you only really have on counter attacking option.

**If you'd like me to go into the 3 and 5 back formations, I'd be glad too; thanks, hope you enjoyed it.**

So if for whatever reason you are unaware of the stat updates (which happen almost every week) a list of the updated player ratings can be found at http://sofifa.com/en/fifa13winter/player/active

Since they are constantly updating the stats, don't expect a big leap in stats from FIFA 13-FIFA 14 like we usually see in a new iteration... expect at most + or - 2 from the updated ratings.

2. Overalls are the stupidest things I have ever seen in my life. They are broken, and I wish they were taken out of FIFA. They only have a few weighted stats for a position and base the rating off of that entirely. 

Jumping/Height/Weight/Work Rates and many other stats have literally NO EFFECT on a strikers rating. Falcao would still be a 90 with 1 jumping. So when you're arguing who should be ""downgraded"" and ""upgraded"" talk about which stats should go up or down rather than the overall ratings.

For example, I saw people having a frothy argument over Joe Hart being a 83 or an 84. This is stupid, Joe Hart has been around the same quality keeper as he was last year, the only real issue with him is that his handling has been suspect in a lot of cases (See Southhampton game). Well lets look at his stats. 

Diving - 86

Handling - **76**

Kicking - 79

Positioning - 81

Reflexes - 88

Oh wow look, they've already addressed that.

So I plead to you. Make your arguments a little more constructive, stay up to date.

* In a special game mode, like Euros mode last year, where you can play a big tournament with all the worlds best teams (like Barcelona, Man United, Santos, ect.) with all there best ever players from past and present.

Not because they had all the stats, but for the fact that they posted the real in game rating of IF players. 

I first noticed this when researching the first IF that Miroslav Klose got this year. It just seemed that there was no possible way that an 84 rated striker could have 99 finishing, 94 heading, and 97 jumping. Something was off. Turns out that when you edit Klose's stats in ""edit player"" to match his in form card, the result is a striker with a rating of 89!

Being able to consult Futguide.com to find this out for all IF players was really cool. We pay big premiums for the stat upgrades that go with In Form and TOTY/S cards. What are we really paying for? This site answered that question! Then the blogger stopped posting after TOTW 31. Just a bit before the TOTS cards came out. 

So for the past few days, I started checking this out for some of the TOTS cards that I thought looked underrated. Here are a list of the cards I checked out. I'll show what their ratings were on their cards, vs what they actually are in game with the new stats.

Bold players are the ""best buys""

Italic players are the opposite.

So I didn't get to do all of them, and yes I do have an affinity to Serie A.  But I found this to have some rather interesting implications.

The first being that EA is blatantly lying to us about the ratings of the vast majority of IF and TOTS cards. I'm not sure what that means, but it is a definite fact. Most are heavily underrated. TOTS Cavani is a FUCKING 96 and costs under 500K!(even if his work rates make that ability a total waste) Some, like El Shaarawy (who is absolutely a blast to use btw) is rated an 85! TOTS Reus is disappointingly exactly the same as what his card says.

The second being that if the handicap does in fact exist, if it works off of comparing team ratings, this could be a brilliant way to get around it. That is if it does exist. The fact that EA lies to us on such a regular basis and prevents all discussion of handicap/scripting on their forums makes me thing that these elements do in fact exist.

Also, I think it is cool to think that you can have an 87 Cavani or Higuain that is actually a 92 in game. Feeling like you're beating the system is always kind of fun.

That being said, we all know that player ratings are kind of a stupid way to judge players in this game. Pace is probably the most important stat in a practical sense, yet I find that it doesn't really determine much when it comes to player ratings by this game. 

Truth be told, use players that are the most fun to use. But I'm interested in these things, so I figured I'd show you all what I found out."	t5_2uh1s	True

This is my first post on reddit, seems like a great community and I'm looking forward to being a part of it! :)

I'm wondering if people would be interested in a trading-based thread where I would share some of the more successful trading tips I've used during FUT 13.

I maintained a trading thread on the EA forums where I started with 10K and traded my way to 3 million in eight weeks and am now interested in doing something similar on reddit (the EA thread can be found [here](http://forum.ea.com/uk/posts/list/2271527.page#23488133)).

The trading spreadsheet I kept to track my progress is in a Google document that can be accessed by [clicking here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiLTXokCZbKMdGlPVkppMU1fcGZBd1lUWk1YY3FvNUE&amp;usp=sharing)

**My first trading tip is to capitalise on hype bubbles.**

A ""hype bubble"" is a temporary spike in the market for a specific player when that player scores, does well, or even plays in a big game (such as the CL).

A few examples of hype bubbles over the past few weeks - 

I had been following the RVP market before last Monday's Manchester United and bought five or six before the game for an average price of 22K each.

After he scored the first goal, his price immediately spiked and continued to rise throughout the game as he went on to score a hattrick.  His price peaked at around 29K.

I was able to recognise that RVP's price was going to rise and picked up a bunch more cards after the first goal.  I ended up making 65K+ in about an hour.  Not too bad.

A more extreme example is how Dortmund's Lewandowski rose from ~2K to ~20K during last week's game where he scored four goals.

Obviously, it's just about impossible to figure out who's going to have a great game, but if you keep an eye on the FUT market whilst watching big matches, it can pay off in a big way.

For example, had you bought Lewandowski at the admittedly already-inflated price of ~8K after he scored the first goal, you still would've ended up making better than 10K profit after tax **per card** after everything was said and done, which is insane! :)

So, if anyone is planning on watching the Barca-Bayern game in a few hours, this will be a good opportunity to put this method to the test and see for yourself how well it can work.

**My second trading tip is to learn to love consumables. :)**

This isn't earth-shattering trading advise by any means, since people have been flipping consumables for years (at least, I assume so), but I think it's worth it to highlight this method now, given that the market as a whole is very unstable right now and the consumables market has been largely unaffected.

First, let me say right away that there is nothing fun about trading consumables.  It is absolutely a grind, but it is a way to make as many coins as you want with virtually no risk.

I'll usually grind it out for an hour or so and pick up 100+ cheap consumables to sell off over the course of a few days.  I'll usually make ~1K per card, and the profit starts to add up when you buy and sell in bulk like this.

Here's a few screenshots of my web app watchlist from last week's foray into the formation market -

[Page 10 of 10](http://s2.postimg.org/tbic5ylrd/Screen_shot_2013_04_23_at_9_24_01_PM.png)

If you pick your times wisely, you can end up with great deals, like [this 41212 formation card I picked up for 150c yesterday](http://postimg.org/image/mxg2l8zib/)

If anyone has any questions about these particular methods, I'm happy to elaborate.  

Also, if anyone has any general questions about the market and/or how to successfully trade through the market crash, I'm happy to share my experiences.

Obviously, they vary greatly based on the user's skill, but since I'm the only one using them, I figured it would be kinda fun. I used the 4-5-1 since it's what I'm most comfortable with and the team i used would suit it fairly well. I wanted to use the highest NIF rating team I could make with around 120k coins also to see if I noticed any sort of handicap, so i used this: 
http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/14186303/

I kept track of rating, goals, assists, passing percentage, dribbling completion percentage, saves, and shots against on goal.





Falcao: I had used him before, but only in a 4-3-3. He was definitely a goal scorer as any lone striker would be, but I really had to slow play down, because unless you have an 85+ pace striker, through balls don't work too well in the 4-5-1. His passing was better than I expected and a lot of my play would run through him so that was nice. And of course, in the air he's incredible.

Goals: 30

Assists: 6

Passing %: 76.8

Dribbling %: 82.2

AVG rating: 7.73




Modric: I had only used Modric for several games before I made this team. I didn't have extremely high expectations, but he was very solid all around. His longshots were definitely my favorite aspect, as 7 of his 8 goals were from outside the box I believe. He also delivered some nice passes into the box and crosses to Falcao. 

Goals: 8

Assists: 11

Passing %: 79.5

Dribbling %: 78.2

Avg Rating: 7.43




Ozil: Ozil was probably biggest letdown of the team. I expected him to produce a lot but I didn't get much. I 
often had to pass back because I just couldn't work around defenders. His workrate let him down too in this squad, because he never seemed to be in place for attacks. His passing was the only positive but that's because it was usually to Xavi or Joao :/

Goals: 4

Assists: 6

Passing %: 86.5

Dribbling %: 79

Avg Rating: 7.5




Iniesta: I was super excited about using Iniesta since I had never used him before, and he was good but kind of inconsistent. There were some games were nobody could touch him and he could weave in and out and others where he was sluggish and his passes were off (handicap?), but overall i was quite pleased. Especially with his shot, was was extremely accurate from all over the field. 

Goals: 15

Assists: 10

Passing %: 84

Dribbling %: 81.8

Avg Rating: 7.55




Di Maria: By far my favorite player in the team was Di Maria. I hadn't used him much before but my goodness does he have ridiculous offensive abilities. It was too easy to get an open shot and score with him from the wing. I've used Robben before extensively and Di Maria played a lot better for me. He could also get back and help Joao on defence which was great.

Goals: 18

Assists: 7

Passing %: 75.2

Dribbling %: 87

Avg Rating: 7.78




Xavi: I had also never used Xavi before this experiment, so that's why I picked him instead of Xabi. His dribbling 
and passing combination was perfect for a central midfielder. If he was a little bigger and stronger he'd be a lot more expensive.. I was still impressed with his defensive abilities though. 

Goals: 4

Assists: 17

Passing %: 77.7

Dribbling %: 93.5 (WTF)

Avg Rating: 7.55




Alba: I was worried about Alba getting up to far but that 90 pace is there for a reason. I didn't expect much but he far exceeded those expectations. Great passer and dribbler, and although his defense isn't exactly Vidic like, the pace makes up for it.

Goals: 1 (Nasty long shot)

Assists: 2

Passing %: 89.5

Dribbling %: 83

Avg Rating: 6.72




Pepe: Pepe was probably the player I had used the most prior to this team and he was just like before, extremely solid all around defender. He made Mascherano look like a little girl, that's for sure. Aggresion, Strength, Heading, Height is all great on Pepe. 

Goals: 2

Assists: 0

Passing %: 84.3

Dribbling %: 65

Avg Rating: 6.83




Mascherano: My least favorite player on the team. His stats look good and everything but for whatever reason, he would just get bullied on through balls and such. Not a jumper or header either. If I could go back, I probably would've tried out Pique even with his workrates.

Goals: 0

Assists: 0

Passing %: 79.5

Dribbling %: 62.3

Avg Rating: 6.65




Joao: Not great, but not bad by any means. Has the pace to get back and is a great passer for a RB. Not much to say about Joao. He got the job done and that was about that.

Goals: 0

Assists: 3

Passing %: 86.7

Dribbling %: 74.3

Avg Rating: 6.82




Valdes: By far the most surprising player on the team. I didn't expect much of anything, but my opinion was probably skewed because of his reputation in real life. In Fifa though, he's an outstanding keeper. In a 4-5-1 where I slow down the play and stay back on D, Positioning becomes the most important GK attribute and that's where Valdes shines. He was never out of place. Even on breakaways he would be at just the right angle to stop 
the shot.

Saves: 152

Shots against on goal: 184

Save %: 82.6

Avg Rating: 7.53




My record during the 30 games was 21-5-4 which is much better than my avg record on FUT. I had a ton of fun making this and I just though I would share, so lemme know what you think! My opinion on handicap is that it's minor but does exist.

1371631666.0	1gn7uj	The 3-4-2-1: The Lost Formation	Beastafer	35	6	28	"Hey guys!

So Iâve been thinking of writing up a 3-4-2-1  âHow Toâ squad for awhile now, and after giving some advice to /u/Duck_on_Quack Iâve decided to put my thoughts on paper about how to utilize this wonderful formation! Itâs one of those formations few try, but in my honest opinion, I canât believe more havenât! It does require some skill and isnât for the novice player, but once you get into the swing of the 3-4-2-1, youâll see what an awesome and fantastic formation it truly is!

Now, onto the 3-4-2-1!

**Overall:**

It's a great formation, but only if you're good defending one-on-one, and you can anticipate where holes in the defense will open up (I'll get to this point in a second). You have to be patient with the ball when things arenât automatically opening up so you can read your opponent, yet you have to have the ability to know when to quickly counter-attack to fully exploit your opponent! 

This formation definitely wonât fit everyoneâs playstyle, and thatâs OK! I encourage all of you to try it out, and just see how it works for you!

**Play style:**

Basically it's a five-back formation, but instead of LWB or RWB you have a LM and a RM, which means that although they can defend, they're used primarily to attack and distribute the ball. In a pinch a good LM or RM should be able to steal the ball, or at least pressure the opponent enough for them to make a bad pass, or give your CBs enough time to track back and mark their man.

If you're poor at defending and rely on other players to help (such as using the right bumper to call another player to help you defend) then I suggest you use a different formation. The strength of the formation is based upon the players being in their right spots to easily distribute the ball, and create passing lanes and opportunities. If you're pulling defenders left and right, soon enough your midfield will be a mess, your CBs marking all the wrong people, and you'll end the game frustrated and angry. I cannot emphasize this point enough. Now, pacy CBs definitely help minimize mistakes that are made when defending one-on-one, and being able to quickly switch to a midfielder to cover the opponent while your CB gets back into position also helps. Don't lean on these tactics though; learn how to be a good defender!

Offensively, the 3-4-2-1 can open up many teams. Take the 3-4-2-1 vs. the 4-2-3-1. In the 4-2-3-1, you're defending with 6 players: the back 4, and the 2 CDMs. In a 3-4-2-1, you're attacking with around 5 guys: either the LM/RM (sometimes both), a CM, and the LF/RF and ST (total of 5). If you make one guy miss, you're now five on five. If you make another player miss, you're four on five. Regardless of that, the spearhead of the formation can easily get through the back four of any formation; in fact, with the LM racing up the field, the LB is pulled over to help contain him, leaving the LF, RF, and ST to deal with a CB, RB, and the last CB respectively, meaning that you've got a man attacking for each guy defending (helps in your favor; very rarely do you come against an opponent who has an attacker for every single defender you have!).

You've got a lot of space to move the ball around as well; usually one CM stays back to defend, while the other pushes up to help move the ball around. That means if the Right CM (RCM) has the ball, he can pass the ball to the RM, RF, ST, and the Left CM (LCM) with ease. That creates a lot of options for the attacker, and leaves the defense puzzled as to what will come next. Be careful overusing the through-ball pass though, as it'll tire out your offense, get intercepted, and a good defender will be able to anticipate your passes. Instead, use the regular pass, and the through-ball in the air pass to help move the ball around (note: I'm not saying don't use the through-ball at all, just don't use it like crazy).

**Players:**

Here Iâll be talking about work rates, as well as the premier players that are great examples of what you want in a 3-4-2-1. Iâm not saying that there arenât other pieces you can put in their place, but the players Iâll suggest will hopefully give you a good idea of what you should shoot for in who you want in your squad!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CBs:
You want them fast and strong. Think Santana, Thiago, Dede, Ramos, Ogbonna, Chiellini, Gamberini, Boateng.

Work rates: High-Medium (only one per squad), Medium-Medium, Medium-High, Low-High (one per squad, your CBs will help intercept and get the balls to the CMs; they can't do that when they're not up close enough).

Reasoning: This is pretty simple, as it is universal between all squads. Too many high-high/medium defenders, and youâll never have a CB back there to defend. Too many low-high/medium defenders, and theyâll never be able to properly distribute the ball to your CMs. You can have 3 medium-medium CBs, but I would always recommend having at least one defender that will stay back and do his job, which is to defend! Remember: These guys are the last line of your defense, and thereâs only three of them! If youâre giving your opponent one-on-ones with your GK, then I donât care if your GK is TOTY Casillas, balls will slip through, and that will be because of you!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LM/RMs: 

Speed is good here, but if you can get a player that distributes the ball well, isn't a huge defensive liability, and crosses pretty well then that'd work too. Gaitian and Maria are two great examples of what I consider the perfect LM/RM, but I've used Neymar (who for some reason is godly at LM) and IF Farfan who also get the job done; it all depends on your ability do defend (remember, if your CB whiffed on the ball, you'll have to contain him with a LM, CM, or RM).

Work rates: High-Medium, Medium-Medium. I wouldn't recommend a high-high, because they'll run themselves into the ground, but you're more than welcome to try it.

Reasoning: Your LM/RMs would be your LWB/RWB in a 5-back formation, so although they arenât fullbacks, your midfielders will need to be at the very least a moderate-OK full back! Now, their ability to defend will really depend on you: if youâre poor at anticipating where the pass is going to go, or canât hold your own one-on-one with the opponent, youâll want a more defensive LM/RM (Gaitain, Maggio comes to mind). However, if you can steal a ball, get a more attacking midfielder! It really depends on you!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CMs: One has to be defensive, one has to be offensive.

Defensive:

Doesn't have to be too pacey, just good at defending and passing the ball. No need to take long shots with this guy. Think Gustavo (the absolute GOD of all 3-4-2-1 defensive CMs), Zanetti, De Rossi, Javi Martinez, Khedira. Work rates: Medium-High, Low-Medium (be careful with this one, I haven't tried this one out too extensively). You don't want low-high, because then they won't help attack. They don't need to be shooting the ball, they just need to help get it to the right people.

Reasoning: If your LM/RM miss, these guys have to be there. If your CB comes up to defend and is pulled out of position, this guy has to take his spot. If you have two attacking CMs in your 3-4-2-1, youâll ALWAYS be susceptible to counter attacks, and the 3-4-2-1 will fail against a seasoned player. 

Offensive:

Doesn't need to be pacey, just good at passing, shooting, and can defend if called upon. Think IF Banega, Schweinsteiger. Work rates: Medium-Medium, High-High. I wouldn't go for a high-medium/medium-low guys because they won't track back and help defend as much as they should. Stick with guys with even work rates.

Reasoning: You can definitely have two defending CMs, but in my opinion they wonât have enough pressure when youâre attacking to help distribute the ball in a 3-4-2-1. Be sure they can defend well enough that if the time calls on them to cover a CB, they can do it well enough. But overall, they have to distribute the ball, and take a shot when the chance comes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LF/RF: Basically anything. Just make sure they're in the right spot at the right time. This position is easy to fill, and work rates donât matter all that much. High-high will bring them too far back into the midfield to really allow them to do their job (which is strictly to attack), so I suggest High-Medium/Low, Medium-Medium/low.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ST: I don't like high-high, but you might. I find high-high to defend too much, so I stick with high-medium/low, medium-medium/low, and that's it. However, if you can work with a high-high, go for it! Just know, theyâll drop back into the midfield a bit more than they should, and that gets annoying after awhile!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**General Tips:**

*Don't be afraid to pass back!* I think a lot of people using the 3-4-2-1 think you always have to keep moving up, but that's not the case! If there's nothing open, don't force it! Pass it back to a CM, your LM/RM, and let the defense create holes for you!

*Through balls in the air will be your friend!* When you're passing the ball with your ST, your LF/RFs will try to sprint through the gaps between the guy defending your and their marker, and an easy lob will give them an easy one-on-one with the goalkeeper.

*Cross it!* Use your LM/RMs to race up the field (when there's a hole) and see if you can get some crossing going! Basically you've got three guys who could get that ball into the net. If you can't make a shot, why not take a chance?

*Set your play style to defensive!* Keeps your guys from running around too much, back tracking when you don't have the ball, and stops you from getting into a frantic passing attack that will ultimately go nowhere. I believe that between balanced and defensive, you won't have much of a need to go to attacking.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So now you know the basics! 

Want a cheap 3-4-2-1 squad to try it out? Have no fear! Hereâs a cheap squad that should be in your budget! (Iâm talking 14k Xbox, 20k PS3, 35k PC!)

Sadly, it does feature an attacking CM (Guarin) who is high-medium, but with his defending abilities and pace, he should be able to track back and help defend when the time comes!

So, thatâs the guide! Youâre welcomed to ask me any questions about squads or if I was vague in any way (PM me, comment here, whichever you prefer!) or you can add me on Xbox Live at Beastafer, and Iâll be sure to provide you with tips and tricks of the formation!

For context, check this out first: http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_FIFA/comments/1483ti/wtf_how_is_this_even_possible/

**So what happened?**

Just prior to EA shutting down FUT13 auctions to fix the issue, I had a chat on the EA forums with JP, the guy who runs http://ultimatedb.nl. 

Because of his access to the market, he can monitor (at least on a proxy level) the amount of coins in the economy. His explanation:


&gt; As far as I can tell somebody figured out how to bid without having the coins to back up the bid. This started on Thursday or maybe even earlier. Last night the cat came out of the bag and the exploit was rampant. My estimate is that we could see over a milliard coins added to the economies both on Xbox and PS3. 
The effects were immediately noticeable in the IF market where a huge buying spree started. 
EA haven't gotten back to me yet with additional info.

**What's the impact?**

&gt; This morning I had the hope that those bids were actually not completing and therefore the coins weren't going to end up in the economy. But alas, it looks like there's suddenly a few milliard coins extra in both the Xbox and PS3 market. 
This will take weeks to settle down.

**What's EA doing about this?**

While EA have acted slowly on this issue, the severity of this exploit can be seen by EA's series of tweets on what we can only suspect is a hotfix: https://twitter.com/EASPORTSFIFA/status/275977336510361600

They repeated this tweet four times in the last 10 hours. Sounds kinda critical, no? :)

**Update from JP flathead (owner of ultimatedb.nl, former fraud investigator for EA)**
http://forum.ea.com/uk/posts/list/2118372.page
&gt; Just to make one thing clear first, I do not work for EA; but I do have access to more information than most of you. 

&gt; The 15M bid thing was a complex exploit used by a small group of people whose sole purpose was to destroy the FUT economy. The hole that the managed to exploit has been found and plugged by EA. 
It will take some time to find and ban all the offending accounts on both Xbox and PS3. I do know that the people in Vancouver are working overtime to get it cleaned up as soon as they can.

**Further update from JP on the cause of the exploit**
&gt;I just received feedback from EA. The exploit is indeed iOS App related (not mine!) They have fixed things and are working on getting FUT up and running again.

I think my squad is somewhat better, so I'm not too worried going in. It quickly shows that the guy is a solid FIFA player, playing a well balanced game, not abusing his pace but playing good football. Persie puts one by me in the 29th minute after a flat pass into the box from Chicharito. I'm having real trouble getting into the game. In the second half I sub in Ibra to get an edge.

6 minutes pass and a couple of delicious moves from Hernandez again, and the mexican sends him in the front with 2 goals. Completely outplays me. This proves to be too much for the guy. Longest celebration possible, shushing me the entire time and making me watch 2 or 3 replays of his goal. I'm pissed.

76 minutes gone and Ibra helps Valbuena to an easy goal for me. 2-1. I'm on attacking and finally my game is really picking up. Ibra is everywhere. 89th minute and Pastore's cross gets to a completely free Ibra who heads it in for the tie. Overtime.

And then right at the end of the first half of OT, Ibra plays a smooth pass between 2 defenders and Lucas picks up the ball and slots in the 3-2 goal with a cool finesse finish. You better believe he's bringing the shushing now :)

Rest of OT I lock him down, have an attempt at the bar and narrowly escape a longshot from Persie but I clinch the victory.

Call me vindictive but it feels so sweet when people start shushing you for no reason and you answer by bringing them the pain.

* Red cards are equal to a goal.
* Goals are still counted.
* If a team forfeits due to lack of players (5 reds?) then they win automatically regardless of the score.
*If it is a draw on reds and goals, then whoever has most yellows (as appears on the match details) wins, then most fouls, and if it's still a draw then figure something out cause it's never happened to us.
* No substitutions apart from forced ones due to injury (but you can move players).

Of course you can't just do it on red cards, because there'd be no reason to have the ball. The whole thing has a nice balance to it, and I've felt more satisfaction earning a forfeit than any other thing whilst playing against mates.

The subs rule is up for debate, but it makes it more fun when you've lost 3 of your back 4 and you just leave it or are forced to fill it with strikers.

To further develop this chemistry between our starter squad, I'm thrilled to introduce a subreddit IRC channel. Hosted on QuakeNet, this is a place to further the discussions that have made this community a great place to talk about our favored game. From talking about your ultimate team builds to setting up your next battle on the pitch, I think a dedicated IRC channel has a lot of potential for our community.

There's a bot set up to let you know when new posts have been made in the subreddit, as well as a few relevant Twitter feeds. If you can think of anything else we might need, don't hesitate to let me know. Keep in mind that it may take awhile for the channel to be super active, but hang out with us when you can!

I have often noticed some players pricing jumping by 100k right before it sold. I have finally looked at it and saw that it was not some freak outlier thing, but one persons trading strategy to dupe buyers. The sellers whose name is thewindos is who is doing this. He lists cards about 15k below their market price to generate interest. Then in the last 15 seconds he bids 100,500 more than the current bid with a second account. He then bids a couple more times with that account to make it seem like it is reasonable then (I am assuming this because it is the only way for his strategy to be profitable with the tax) he accepts a trade offer he made to himself for like a bronze contract or something if no one else take the bait and bids. If you are just shopping for one of these players, be careful not to misclick and spend 100k more than you intended. If you are a trader of these cards, first of all fuck off so that you don't bid me up, and second of all don't clog your watch list with his cards.

I want to put together a decent EASY resource for getting your game set up with these chants. Even with this method, you'll need to spend some time in the game assigning the right tracks and playlists.

To download a good amount of tracks that will cover most teams you'll want. [CLICK HERE](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B1t4sLfdAoMvUXZ1XzNOaERxY2c)

To find more go here: [Fanchants.com](http://www.fanchants.com)

Video's explaining the process:

PS3: [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHlsR0c8EFU)

XBOX: [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkQPOuhbAgg), [2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B056789Y1cc)

PC: [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGAcd8vjyik)

Written Directions (not gonna lie, I copy pasted from some other website!):

For PS3 users: 

1. Copy them over to the PS3 via flashdrive/cd etc. Go to Music and find your Disc or MP3 player or USB etc., press triangle and copy them onto your PS3. 

2. FIFA will access Chants from a set playlist. You have to create these playlists. If you've already copied them they should have automatically assembled themselves as an album i.e. all Bradford songs should be in a Bradford file....highlight this, press triangle, add to playlist, create playlist, name it...""Bradford Chants"" etc. wallah, you have your playlist.....if you haven't added them to your console yet go to Music on your PS3, then Playlists&gt;Create New Playlist, then name the playlist a specific club, i.e. Bradford. Then, as the files are named by Album, just find the specific ""album"" you've just installed, press Triangle and ""Add to Playlist"" then find the apt Playlist you've just created i.e. Chelsea and bob's your uncle, all chants are now in that Playlist. Repeat this step for all Chants and Clubs you want in the game. 

You can do 1 and 2 in any order. i.e. you can name playlists before you install the files. ALTHOUGH if you insall the audio first, it makes it quicker as naming playlists can be done by selecting the ""album"" Triangle&gt;Add to Playlist&gt;Create Playlist, and it'll already have the name of it there, there's no need for a keyboard! 
For Entrance music and Goal Music etc. These are indvidual files. Just leave them in the folder. You've only made a playlist for the above because they have many files. Entrance music etc. only has one. Therefore, there's no need. 

For Xbox 360 users: 

As you'll know there are lot of problems facing 360 owners, from burning, to transfering, to file names...the following explanation was made some time ago, instead you may want to follow the instructions in this thread: [Here](http://forum.ea.com/uk/posts/list/12471.page)

File name transfering from PC to 360 is becoming a bit of enigma, no-one actually knows if it's possible. (I haven't got an Xbox myself, I'm just taking other owner's advice) 

Anyway, the original instruction: 

1. It's the same process as for the PS3, but instead of using a flashdrive, burn the chants/themes onto a cd (of which needs to be a CD-R, the 360 does not recognise DVD-RW or CD-RW discs. 

2. You will need to make the CD a ""Audio CD"", otherwise you will not be able to copy the files to your HD. Be advised, burning the CDs as ""audio"", means that you'll need more than one cd, as most programs won't let you write more than ""a given number"" of tracks on the cd. So even though you'll have more than enough space in terms of MB, you won't be able to finish the cd if you have to many files. 

3. To then make a custom soundtrack, [go here.](http://www.ehow.com/how_2071060_custom-soundtracks-xbox.html )


If you find that certain audio is too loud or too quiet, you can download ""Audacity"" (free),http://audacity.sourceforge.net 
Open the specific file(s) and increase or decrease volume by Select All&gt;Effect&gt;Amplify&gt;Extract as MP3

For the people who like statistics.	nurriz	27	4	21	"I wanted more statistics for my FUT matches than what FIFA currently offers, so I built a site to let me record match results. I've posted here before about it when the site was very basic. I've since added more statistics and the possibility to add goalscorers for your goals.

An example of the statistics the site offers right now can bee seen here: http://stats.fifavibe.com/user/nurriz

I'm adding more statistics regularly and doing further integration with Google Charts. What's missing right now is form curves and a better presentation of past results.

Further features planned are attaching squads to matches. This would allow to show statistics of each player's goals per match, which currently isn't possible because a player only gets registered in case of a goal. Right now the site only supports FUT Seasons as that is what I play the most. Support for Cups willl be added, and when I get the point details for all divisions in H2H it could also be added.

Don't know if anyone has any use for this kind of functionality but now it's out there.

Big thanks goes out to the guys over at Futwiz for supplying the player database used for searching goalscorers. 

If you have any ideas for the site, general feedback or any bugs to reports, please don't hesitate to write in here or message me.

http://stats.fifavibe.com

~~**EDIT: I am aware of the problems with registering. I hope to get time to fix it today (31st of May). Sorry for the inconvenience.**~~

**EDIT: I seem to have fixed the issue. The registration works now. Thanks for all your help, hope you enjoy the site.**

**EDIT 1st June 2013: I added a feedback system on the site for bugs and ideas. You might know it, as it's the same as used on Futhead. You can find it in the bottom right corner on all pages of the site. Looking forward to your suggestions!**

1366413139.0	1cpgv0	What I think we deserve from EA in FIFA 14.	ChedduhBob	27	7	37	"Before I even write this there are a few things:

1. This will be extremely long.
2. Let's be honest: None of the stuff I mention will be addressed.
3. I primarily play FUT and Seasons. I have played zero Pro Clubs and a small amount of career mode. If there is something that you would like to mention from these game modes, be my guest
4. The limited stuff I saw from the previews seem dumb as shit. Rather than focus on a game that clearly needs fixing they add a stutter step before you shoot, and a knuckling free kick. I think that is an insult and a slap in the face to anyone that plays their game. The arrogance it showed to me was on par with someone saying that QPR was managed well this season.

One of the first things many people would like to see is fixed animations/player momentum issues. What do I mean by this? The players do a lot of stupid unrealistic things. The jump over the ball may be the most unrealistic thing implemented in a FIFA game I have ever seen. Not only does it slow your player down to the point that it typically kills any counter attack you had, it often fucks up and bounces off the player's heels. I think that is a ridiculous thing to put into the game and no one likes it. Take it out. Please. The next thing that fits into this category is momentum of the players. I don't mean scripting, but what I mean is the physical momentum of the players. I have had times where a stationary player receives a pass and I hold LT to start dribbling so it remains under control. One of his players will come and tackle me with a clean tackle, and then my player starts to stumble a good 8 yards. I have no idea where this momentum would come from. My player was not moving fast, so how could he develop so much momentum so quickly. I know some of you may be thinking, ""WELL A CRUSHING TACKLE WOULD KNOCK HIM DOWN!"" Yes, that is true, but for my player to stumble forward several yards, there is something wrong with the game.

The next thing I am going to talk about may be the elephant in the room, and to some the most glaring issue: Pace. To me personally it isn't that big of an issue, but to some it is game breaking. A lot of people sit here and complain about it, but I havent seen a well developed argument against it. Here is mine. The problem does not lie with attacking in any way shape or form. The area that must be fixed is defending. The way the system is currently set up, all defenders mark pretty much flawlessly, are always in a perfect position, never get beaten while containing, and have tremendous tackle boxes(the area where they will initiate a tackle). When you take this into consideration, some may say that they need these things to combat pace. This isn't true in the slightest. What happens is that bad players can't beat these defenders against players that are pretty good, so they think to themselves they must outrun these defenders. I was a noob once too, and this is how I thought the game worked. They build these teams with speed because defense is way unbalanced as it stands. What should they do? Positioning is a meaningless stat, and I don't care how much you argue that is just the truth. It is stupid to think that a player in the MLS on the Colorado Rapids is a better defender than John Terry. Players like Wynne are not that good in real life because he lacks the positioning and the ability to predict opposing player's movement and mark. They need to make this apply to contain as well. From what I can tell players containing stay locked on perfectly almost all the time. What they need to do is make positioning affect the way that contain works. A player like Pique should be a good defender in this game, but he isn't. He should have a much better ability to contain than David Luiz. If they make it easier to beat defenders like David Luiz, players wont feel as if they have to use such fast players.  THey should be able to tweak it so moves like body feints and stepovers throw containing defenders off more. As it stands now defense is just being strong and fast, and player positioning, and knowledge mean nothing. They would obviously need to tweak and balance this because if any body here played FIFA 11, and maybe 10, skilling was too easy, and defending was useless. Making positioning more important and weakening the contain ability of defenders with poor stats would help to introduce redeeming qualities for defenders like Vidic, Terry and Pique. As it stands now, Felipe Santana is 100 times the defender any of those guys are. That idea may make better sense in my head, and I kind of rambled but oh well.

Next issue. Fix the goddamn economy. Playing the game should be more important than trading. Introduce things like challenges for players. Score a 5 minute hat trick in an online seasons match. Win the gold cup twice in 48 hours. The possibilities are endless. Maybe make a weekly challenge like score a hat trick with 10 different players. That would increase variety and present an opportunity to make coins more easily available. This along with increasing the card weight should make the prices more reasonable. Before we go on to the next point all i can say is LOLPCPRICES.

The next thing I think we should get are more tutorials. This doesn't apply to me as much, but it would benefit a lot of people. The tutorials they have right now are a joke, but I will say the skill games are a step in the right direction. An example to look at is NBA 2K games. When looking objectively, it is the best sports game franchise hands down. The tutorials in that game tell you everything. I think that FIFA should put in tutorials for all of the skill moves, and better defensive tactics.

Next is a direct gameplay issue that applies to all game modes. Heading basically seems like a crap shoot to me. I have had Messi win headers of players like Pepe and Thiago Silva. That would literally happen maybe 1/1000 times in real life. It would happen, but not at the rate it currently does. Aguero is incredible in the air too. I don't know what it is, but he is always smashing me in the air, and in real life the last thing any one is doing on defense is planning for an aerial assault from him. Also some of that is positioning as well. If you notice on the break what happens is your defenders run a little bit past the attacker, in what I think is an effort to hold a line, and typically they don't make it back to the striker and lose the header. I know in one of the previous points I mentioned that positioning should be a big impact, and made worse for a lot of players, but, to me anyways, the headers I surrender are often ridiculous and I think this is an issue.

I just wrote a ton and I can't think of anything I think EA has fucked up royally on. These may be a product of rage, but I do have a bunch of avid FIFA gamers at my college and they tend to agree upon most of these issues. If you would like to add some stuff, I would love to talk about it, I could talk about FIFA all day. 

Thank you for making it this far into the post if you did!

I was just playing a normal D1 game, went 1-0 up in the 14' min, then my opponent gets a goal back in 16' due to really bad defending on my part (he just ran down the wing, to the bye-line, cut in and shot) so that was ok. But then from that point onwards (**16 minutes in**) he starts playing it around the back for the rest of the fucking game. What makes it even more annoying is the team he had: (41212)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

TOTS Cavani --- IF Muriel

-----------TOTS Hamsik

Robinho ------------- TOTS Lamela

-----------TOTS Vidal

IF Lulic - IF Chiellini - TOTS Campagnaro - Abate

-----------TOTS Marchetti 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Would this piss anybody else off? It pisses me off enough when people do it in the 80+ min, but not the 20th, especially with a team costing over 1mil!!!

Luckily he got clumsy towards the 70th minute so I capitalised, got the ball to Aguero and went 2-1 up. At that point I was just giving him some of his own medicine, making him chase me around like a wild goose. Got a penalty, 3-1 up. Then just finished it 5-1.

**SIF Klose:** Right place, right time, all the time. I cannot empasise his attack positioning enough. If there's a rebound or a loose ball in the box, it doesn't matter if your CB has 99 pace, Klose is getting to that ball before he does. Stronger than his stats, reliable as a rock in the box, and deadly in the air. All of this, for 28k. I can only imagine if he'd gotten a TOTS card...

**Reus:** needs no introduction. If you haven't tried him, just do. Even on 6 chem.

**Gotze:** Surprisingly good for me, because I wasn't expecting too much. His dribbling is amazing, better than Robben's, and equaled only by Neymar's. NEVER loses his footing, even when he loses the ball, which means he spends less time on the ground and more time fighting to get the ball back. Very hard worker for me despite the m/m workrates. Excellent short passing game, wish his long passing was better, though. A reliable finisher in the box as well, provided you aren't too far away from the keeper.

**Robben:** Actually feels like 93 pace, which is saying something. Another one to try if you haven't already. Is ALWAYS making runs into the box, so even when you can't get him the ball he's always dragging opposing defenders out of position. Only caveat: Don't shoot with his right foot. Just don't. It's not worth it.

**Neymar:** Incredible dribbler. When I've got a comfortable lead, I just pass the ball to him and try to get a skill run going. A chop here, McGeady spin there, and he's off to the races. Also amazingly quick, and stops on a dime. Got a mean shot on him, too, and the best finesse - bar Robben's - that I've tried on this year's FIFA.

**Marchisio:** A bit of a hit-and-miss to be perfectly honest, but when he's a hit he's a MASSIVE hit (and he's a hit 7 games out of 10. The other 3 he's sitting about waiting for the whistle to blow). Amazing all-rounder, is without a doubt the top assist-giver on this team. And when he gets a pop at goal in open space, the keeper's going to have to earn his keep...

**Gilherme Santos:** Interesting little player. Obviously he's here just to keep Neymar chemistry-happy, but he plays his part well enough. Has a penchant for making great overlapping runs w/Neymar down that left-hand side. Not a shabby defender, either, but is completely average when compared to the next guy on this list:

**Lahm:** Where do I begin? I legitimately cannot remember the last time someone faced up to him, one-on-one and escaped with the ball if I'd moved to make the tackle. Incredibly quick with his feet, insanely responsive in general, never loses his footing, is simply solid down his flank, doesn't get too far forward... can't say enough about him. Great passer, too. Doesn't have much of a shot on him, but you don't buy your RBs to score you goals, do you?

**Ogbonna:** Also needs no introduction. He's better than Chiellini. Harder-working, Faster, Taller, and Stronger, somehow. I feel like you could pair him with anybody in back and he'll keep things together. Tied with Thiago Silva as my favourite CBs this FIFA. Bonus: scores headers from corners for fun. If you get 5 corners in a game - and you know how to use your corners - you can rest assured he'll nod at least one of those in for you.

**Chiellini:** Not much to say about him. Also pretty good, but is like a slightly more sluggish, less aggressive, less awesome Ogbonna. Still monstrous, though, but given the chance I'd just clone Ogbonna. Either way, neither of them have too much work when they're backed by the next player:

**SIF Handanovic:** Oh. My. Word. This guy. This guy, man. Absolutely rock solid. He NEVER fumbles the ball, he never lets in the easy goal, he does double-saves on the regular, he saves penalties like a fiend... and his throwing! His throwing! He just pitches the ball out to the halfway line without a sweat. Is without a doubt the best keeper I've used on ANY fifa. He's better than Casillas, Buffon, IF Adler, Sirigu, Marchetti, Cech, Lloris... and for under 50k? Are you kidding? Is the main reason I can't switch out the back line for a Dede-Thiago Silva-Artur Moraes combo. I just gotta have him in there.

***Stud of the squad award:*** Split between SIF Klose and SIF Handanovic. Both of them save my bacon way, way too often - I couldn't do without either.

1365364539.0	1bvbg7	A Weekend with Ronaldo (Player Review)	ChedduhBob	22	3	23	"Well after finally making my way to 1.7 million coins I reached what has honestly been my end game since the beginning. Being a Madrid fan, and someone who enjoys winning in FUT, I decided to pick the best player in the virtal and real world of football (the real life comment is a little biased :P, now downvotes please!). 

I have used every player that is worth a lot of coins outside of Team of the Years, and I can honestly say Ronaldo is hands down way better than any other player in the game. No player has that dribbling, that shot, those skills, that pace, and that strength in one package. He can shred through the most sweaty 352 defenses, whether it be Santana and David Luiz, or Chiellini and Ogbonna they might as well be bronzes because they stand no chance. Combining his pace with what most would view as the best skill move in the game (the running scoop turn) turns into a lethal combination. He also has the best shot in the game. I know a lot of people will claim that Messi is better because of his higher finishing, but once you get to the 90s it is all the same. The thing that sets Ronaldo apart from Messi is Ronaldo's immense shot power. The ball is sent out like a fucking cannon and while Messi may be able to tuck it in on the finesse with either foot, in a year of the impossible-to-save near post smash, Ronaldo's ability to execute with either foot makes him a better choice. 

He also is ridiculously good at some other things that set him farther apart. I don't know if it is just me, but his corner kicks were incredble. He found my CBs in the box everytime, and when he was in the box he was just as lethal. His passing is some of the best in the game as well, and he can play any through ball to any player. His free kicks do suffer a bit from accuracy, but I did score a bunch, when only putting a slight amount of power on it. 

Another thing to note is people, again as they did with Messi, go bonkers when they see him and it gets annoying. They do shit like score a goal and hold possession for the rest of the match and harrass you like they just one the world cup. Then the best is the people that offer to duplicate your players as soon as they see it. It's typically good for a laugh, but if you lose expect to be messaged. I didn't realize that buying a card on Ultimate Team clearly meant that I was homosexual, and that I have no life.

I know a lot of people like to see squads so here are the two I used: 

http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/8877719/

http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/8698861/

I started out with the first, and I just couldn't play that well with the 433, so I went back to my trusted 352 and swapped Ronaldo for Lucas. I know the squad is absurdly sweaty, but it was so much fun because it gave me everything I needed in a squad.

I don't know what else to say about him. 68 goals in 25 games should be enough to say. Is he worth it? Absoulutely, positively.......HELL NO. 1.68 MILLION FOR A PLAYER? ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING? NOW WAY! he is great, but unless you, like me, are a Madrid super fan there is no reason to buy him right now. You could build like 4 incredible teams for that money. Overall though he is the best plaer in the game, and that was just his regular card. Good luck to anyone who manages to get him, he's a blast to play with.

TL;DR: Best player in the game, insanely overpriced. If you're not subbing him in or switching him to play striker you're doing it wrong."	t5_2uh1s	True

1361414531.0	18xge7	The Secret To Penalty Kicks 	crocajun1003	25	5	33	"You guys enjoyed my last tip so much I'm going to give you another one. 


PKs can be excruciating. At times it will seem like you never guess the right direction. PKs can frustrate players to point of completely losing their mental edge. And shootouts? Losing a shootout can put anyone on suicide watch. So what's the secret? The secret is to take your head out the game and trust the odds. 


**PKs**

Pick a side right now. Left or right. Chose one. From now on this is your side. Every time you get a PK, whether you're taking the kick or playing goalie, you go to this side. If you miss it, oh well, the odds will come back to you eventually. 
This simple tip has allowed me to be a much more level headed player and not think myself out of matches. When my opponent blocks it, it just rolls off my back, but the majority will go in because going the same direction every time put the odds in your favor. 

**Shootouts**

Shootouts are a bit different because an intelligent opponent can eventually catch on to your game. I haven't lost a shootout since I don't know when. Here's the shootout secret. 


On your first PK, go the OPPOSITE direction of your chosen PK direction, then, on the next four, resume going in your chosen PK direction. 


For goalie, when blocking the SECOND PK, remain in the middle. Other than that, resume diving in the same direction. 

That's it. Enjoy your Fifa. "	t5_2uh1s	True

1373564913.0	1i3ep7	Let's Assume Scripting Exists, How Does It Work?	FUTblog	27	10	56	"Alright guys, I've decided to make a video to talk about scripting. I want to get my facts straight so I can make the video as informative as possible. I'd also like to not sound like a babbling idiot.

Since EA keeps rejecting the theory, we are not 100% sure that it exists. Their constant moderation of scripting talks on the forums doesn't exactly boost their cause.

But I believe that we've all experienced something along the lines of ""scripting"" (45' / 90' goals, defenders stupidity, lucky rebounds, etc.)

I don't want to take a definitive stance, so I will begin my argument by assuming that Scripting does exists and provide arguments in favor of it and how to stop it.

To my understanding, scripting most often occurs when two mismatched teams play each other (86 overall vs 81 overall). The 81 overall receives some sort of a ""handicap"" which will help to level the playing field. 

Some users claim that by lowering your overall (bronze bench, subbing out low rated players for high rated players from your bench, etc.) will lower / negate the effects of scripting and MAY put it in your favor.

There's also talk of momentum as well, I'm not too sure where this comes into play but I'd really like to hear your input.

Our rules:

* If you get a free kick and it tells you how many yards out you are, you must shoot. No exceptions.

* If you are up by 3+ goals you must have your goalkeeper take all your penalties, free kicks and corners. 

* No 'tramp' goals, Square passing it when you are 1 on 1 with the goalkeeper. This has caused controversy and we have been known to upload goals and have our friends vote on if they should stand or not. We call them our dubious goal panel commitee.

* If a game goes to extra time we must always select the penalties option.

* If you lose by at least 5 goals you must publically shame yourself about your shitty play.

* If you lose by 10 goals you must buy the other person dinner. There has been only 2 instances of this and yes i do blame EA not that large bottle of Vodka.

1. Why is a player like Chicharito considered ""sweaty"" when players like Reus are given a slide. Reus is statistically better than so many sweaty players, he's extremely cheap and he fits in to a bunch of teams.

2. Why are defenders ignored as being sweaty? Players like Clichy, Alba, Abate and Kyle Walker never get complaints, but out on the wings they can be huge difference makers. With Ronaldo on my team I fear two players. Abate and Kyle Walker. Nobody ever complains about them being OP.

3. I don't play the silver tournaments that much, but is pace basically the deciding factor in that meta-game? When I trade with silvers the only redeeming factor of the expensive ones is pace. It's absurd how much some of the players that aren't even that good go for.

I don't think pace is as big of an issue as everyone makes it out to be, but it frustrates me when people comment on squads people make and complain about sweat when they have players like Reus and Alba on they're team. Is there a rule that a certain number of coins justifies pace? I just don't understand this community sometimes.

TL;DR: What is sweaty? I see too many conflicting answers/comments to decide what it is. I want to know so people don't call me a pacewhore when I put squads on here."	t5_2uh1s	True

Decided to make my own FIFA 14 cover. Sick of seeing Messis' gob on the front.

Yes, I am aware that he does not play for that team anymore. I am a Gomez fan and wanted to do it with him. May try some more later.

I am aware that this may be a bit shit, it was done with a browser photoshop knockoff. May try some in actual photoshop later.

Hope someone enjoys it.

Edit: I know this isn't like BLOWING up but there are about 5 more responses than I had anticipated (appreciate it). Just want to let you know that I will try to get to yours when I can (or during a time when I don't have actual work, at work...). If you can be patient that would be great, if you could also either provide a high-res photo or something where the player is already cropped out of the background (search PNG files on google) that would be most helpful.

So here's my guide to help you play a 4-2-2-2 and try out a new formation!

**4-2-2-2 Guide**

So with the 4-2-2-2 you're going to be passing a lot. Passing, dribbling, and making the most of your space. The most important stats for your attackers are going to be Dribbling, Passing, and Ball Control in no particular order.

The style of play is not direct and it is direct. What I mean by this is, you're not going to have much success just giving it to your striker or CAM and having him run in a straight line. The way to play is fast with a lot of passing. You need to take your touches in ways that give you space and open up passing lanes. 

*Position Breakdown*

**Striker:** So you're going to want both of your strikers to have decent passing, ball control, and dribbling. I like them both to also have high attacking work rates.

**CAM:** Your CAMs are NOT wingers. They will NOT hug the line, they sit slightly more inside than a winger and they are there to pass. I like to have 1 Cam with high/low work rates and 1 cam with med/med workrates. The high/low cam should typically be kind of pacy 80+ and have good ball control and dribbling. Not to mention good passing. I typically use him to pass, play combinations, and beat people 1 on 1. 

The second med/med cam should have good ball control, dribbling, and i usually like him to be a great passer. Also pace is important unless it's ronaldinho who can beat people, or juninho. I'm not talking 90+, just make sure this guy has at least 75+.

Alternative: Any workrates will work, these are just how I do it.

**CDM:** One CDM needs to be med/high or low/high. The other is my workhorse, High/high are his workrates. 

The first low/high CDM is your true CDM. He sits back and reads play and protects your back 4. He is also used in combination play and distribution, so I like him to be decent at passing. 

The high/high workhorse CDM is your utility man. He needs pace, passing, stamina, and decent defending stats. I love ramires in this role. He has the pace to be EVERYWHERE, the stamina, and the stats.

Alternative: Both can be low/high or med/high. I just prefer to have one Ramires like workhorse. 

**Center Back:** The only workrate requirement here is that he can not have high attacking workrates. 

**Fullbacks:** These are the most important players on your defense. If they suck you will get beat on the wings 24/7 because the CAMs dont help much. Make sure they are solid defensively with okay pace. I like Sagna( perfect defensive fullback example) and Clichy(has the pace to make up for his workrates.)

**GK:** Whoever your prefer. However if you defend well you will want a shot stopper. Also don't be afraid to try a keeper who previously sucked, I've found keepers to be very formation dependent because each formation changes the way your opponents can come at you. 

**Tips:** Don't be aggressive with your backline. Maybe practice playing on defensive. 

Most good players play on defensive.

Don't play too direct or you will get frustrated.

Remember to pass, pass, dribble, pass, pass, dribble.

On seasons the perfect team for this is Man City.

Do not use this formation with a mediocre team(3 star or lower on seasons), it requires quality on the ball.

**Two pre-made teams**

Expensive-ish: http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/11440902/   (Mandanda is a legend for me. I swear its formation dependant.)

Budget: http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/11443522/

(The cost listed on Futhead is very very wrong.)

Enjoy playing with the 4-2-2-2. :)

Adamkiksyou	30	14	103	"First off, sorry for being cocky or annoying to anyone, I have been downvoted a lot recently for not sharing the same opinions on this subreddit in a very arrogant manner. I'd like to apologize to everyone in all three FIFA subreddits (apart from one person who I will not name simply because they have been a dick to me too.) In other words, **Sorry**.

Now, onto pace and the FUT community.

I am extremely disappointed in this year's community, I have been in arguments (in these very subreddits) about how Erik Lamela, or Ben Arfa, are too slow, and that you should use Walcott or Biabiany instead. I completely understand *why* people need more pace this year. The game simply got more competitive, and that is nothing anyone can do anything about apart from Electronic Arts themselves. But please. Let's be realistic here, you don't need 96 pace. You never will, even if you play against the same Santana-Dede partnership every game, you don't need that pace. I feel as though this community (not the reddit community, the *entire* FIFA community) has taken it to the extreme end where a Ligue 1 team isn't a Ligue 1 without the Remy and Aubameyang combo, or that a serie A team needs Gio - Muriel - Biabiany to succeed. I don't like this at all. It really does make me sad because I just can't see what's so fun about those players. Yeah I guess you get to score a lot of goals and rub those ""shush"" celebrations in your opponents face, but I find it more fun to score goals with Players like Ben Arfa, Lisandro Lopez, lamela etc, and what pisses me off, is that the players I just mentioned aren't even slow at all. But sadly this is the more unpopular opinion this year. I even heard a commentator call Inform Di Natale (88 pace) not fast. Alright, I am done. I doubt anyone will read through the entire thing, but I just needed to get these things off my chest."	t5_2uh1s	True

1354177905.0	13zhl4	My take on how to deal with the market crash for TOTY.	j_sciessere	17	1	59	"Last year I got caught out bad - I spent a good 100k on my team right before Christmas, and came back to find that I lost about half my money because all my players prices had dropped so significantly. This year, I traded much smarter at the start and managed to build these two teams which I use on a rotation basis: A team - http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/1632866/
and B team - http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/1632911/
Plus another 500K in the bank. However, after last year I'm not going to make the same mistakes again. I'm going to sell off both my teams right before the market crashes and bank all my money so that I don't lose much money and buy these two teams: http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/1659423/
http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/1659937/

Even though the first one is disgustingly sweaty, if you buy well enough you shouldn't be spending much more than 10k on each team, and as the players are so cheap you probably won't actually lose any money, all while still playing and generating that massive fortune you know you want. 

The reason I'm doing this is because according to futhead I have about 600K worth of players (I know it's actually a LOT less), say they drop in value by 2/3, at the end of the crash I would only have 400K worth of players. If I sell and hold my 600K through the crash, I'll end up with my team and an extra 200K that I wouldn't have had otherwise. Add that 200K to the 500K I already have saved up, and I'll be almost halfway to Ronaldo (who will also hopefully drop too)."	t5_2uh1s	True

I have been having troubles on World Class, so I bumped it down to Pro. The CPU started to actually make mistakes (maybe too many), and gave me some time and space on the ball. It gave me a chance to practice dribbling and passing without getting too frustrated. I found that skilled dribbling (Holding pace control + sprint) results in ""FIFA-street like"" precision dribbling. Suddenly I was beating 1 and 2 defenders at once and firing off shots from outside the box and scoring. Buildup play and passes became fluid and open. This fits right into my style of play, possess, pass, give and go, and a mix of long range shots and working it into the goal mouth. I think you can be a great player without this skill, but for me, this kicks my game up several notches."	t5_2uh1s	True

IndigoFerrari	17	1	15	"Right now I have an all bronze two-star team (Rating 62), All prefer the 4-1-2-1-2 all blokes from England (except the manager - sidebar:  Does the managers nationality increase chemistry?  I can't find a bronze ENG manager who uses 4-1-2-1-2).  Their chemistry is 92 or something right now.

I'm getting into the bronze tourney, hope to start banking coin over there.  My question is:  Is it folly to focus on Chemistry so much?  How high a rating can a good all bronze team have if they ignore chemistry?  I really like how my team works together, I see it in all the passing and movement going on.  My proudest moment was tying 2-2 with a 4 star team (I think 4 stars, he was like 77 or something overall. Don't remember except his team was 10/11 gold players.  His Chemistry was in the low forties.  

Is that in itself a testament to the might of good chemistry?  I skipped fifa 12 so this is my first FUT experience.


Can you change a players formation preference?  I saw something mentioned that led me to believe it can be converted for money or something.  Not sure.

What time should I set for my trades?  I know for me I avoid stuff that closes after multiple hours because if it's something I want I want to be there at the end for the bidding war.  Is that the same across the board?


Will there be new manager tasks?  I completed the first set today.  

EDIT:

Also:  For flips sake.  When playing using Tele camera.  regular settings (not manual)  If I'm a breakaway, middle of the field going towards the right side goal, just me and the keeper.  How does aiming work?  So we are clear, pushing the stick to the right would end up shooting it straight at the goal?  Or does the stick represent the goal, so to the right would mean right side of the goal?  I hope this is clear.

Before this I had no clue what FUT was and never tried it, used to be playing Seasons with Real Madrid all the time. But now I know what I had been missing. I have learned a lot from this forum on how best to play FUT, what players to get and suggestions with my squad build. I think I have done fairly well winning Division 1 a couple times and jumping now between Div 1 and 2. Building squads, trading, trying out different formations are the best fun I have had in fifa. 
tl;dr :  Thank you all :-)

Edit:  thought I would show off my teams ;-)

1363942341.0	1asgej	I know this is a subreddit dedicated to FIFA but there really isn't a community for PES. I'd like to know some of your thoughts on the game.	jpwasson	22	5	26	"I just downloaded PES 2013 from Steam and have put about 4 hours of gameplay into it. Let me just say, this game is fantastic. It's hard for me to put my finger on exactly what about this game feels so much better. But I'll give it a shot. 

The balance and fluidity of the game seems so much better than FIFA. Defending requires a great amount of skill. Outrageous goals are rarely scored. Attacking requires implementation of actual strategy instead of quick fire counter attacks. Players make smart runs and seem to actually try and place themselves in a positive position. 

To be completely honest, FIFA feels like an arcade style game while PES feels like a simulation. I've played FIFA since 2006 and this is only the second time I've played PES but I'm incredibly impressed. It has completely outdone FIFA in regards to gameplay. 

The single and online play of PES can't really compete with FIFA right now. The single player manager mode lacks depth and replay value. The Champions League presentation is great but their is very little youth scouting and recruitment and the transfer negotiations are somewhat strange. PES is of course also missing alot of the licensing rights that FIFA has. That was easily worked around on PC though. I downloaded a patch that revamped all the rosters and added all team crests and various leagues from across the world. And the big factor... Ultimate Team. I adore ultimate team. I have so much fun creating different squads and playing with various hybrids. It's all I basically do on FIFA and could be the deciding factor in which game I buy next year. 

So what are your thoughts on PES compared to FIFA? I'd love to have a little discussion and see some opinions.

TLDR: Played PES for the first time in a couple years and was incredibly impressed. Gameplay is better than FIFA IMO. Yet the single player doesn't measure up. What are your thoughts?"	t5_2uh1s	True

So we've had a lot of posts lately that talk about the crash, so let's just make a definitive ""Crash Guide 101"" thread we can reference posters to!

A couple quick questions to get the ball rolling:

1. IF's: Will they lose substantial value post-crash? 

2. Sell the Team or Keep it: We've seen a lot of great teams on here that cost relatively nothing yet are still competitive. Would you personally recommend selling your high-priced BPL team or are you keeping it? 

3. The Old Cards: When a player gets a new card with upgraded stats, how valuable will his old card be? Let's take Ribery for example: His card is currently around 400k on the XBL market, and should he get an upgrade, what's that card going to drop to? Will it substantially lose value (I'm talking a 200k+ drop) or will it still be a card worth keeping/selling in the future?

You don't want to shell out coins on a player only to learn one game later that the guy had a single contract left. Subsequently, a lot of players are sold for the same price, but one guy could have 30 contracts remaining while another has only 7. This allows you to save contract cards and coins that can be used to buy better and/or more players.


Example: [A Tim Howard GK I bought for 400 coins with ~30 contracts at the time of purchase](http://i.imgur.com/UZBor.jpg) as opposed to a [Tim Howard GK I just observed being sold for the same amount, but with just 7 contracts.](http://i.imgur.com/1mfpC.jpg)"	t5_2uh1s	True

A few new things to note:

* A shit ton quicker since we have stopped it making constant database connections and it's all done in jQuery now!
* Drag and drop for changing players.
* Inserting players defaults them to the position you are putting them as opposed to their default card position.
* Now includes the 7 members of the bench.
* Will give you a star rating including the bench so you can use your sweaty bronze bench to see if you qualify for the 4* tournament :p
* Position changing is now with buttons instead of a fugly drop down!

1363187640.0	1a7vh9	[FUT] Player Review: IF Gotze	Greenears13	16	3	12	"Attached is the team i used for majority of this review: http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/6951560/#squad-player

I wasn't sure if this was something that you guys would want to read or not but i thought i would share my opinion on a few expensive players i have used this year. My reasoning for this is simple, i have bought a few expensive players his year and found them to be good players but not good for me and my style. 

As you can see i lined up in the 4-3-1-2 with Gotze player at the CF position, i played this formation and mainly this team for 20 matches or so and Gotze, in my opinion is a great player and worth the 300k you are likely to spend obtaining him.

**Strengths** - Obviously his key attribute is his Dribbling, with in game stats of 94 Ball control and 92 Dribbling coupled with 92 Agility and 4 Star skill moves and week foot. i found him very dangerous picking the ball up at the edge of the D and even with a couple of defenders on him a quick change of direction and he would be one on one with the keeper and even though his shooting is less than desirable (only 80 Finishing, 74 Shot power) but i found his ability to get into a lot of space made up for this as you could easily just take a low shot and beat the keeper. 

Another key point to his game was passing, with 90 Short passing and 86 Visions i found his through balls to my pacey strikerâs usually on point and his long passing isn't bad either.

**Weaknesses**  - Physically you're probably struggle up against big strong defenders and CDM's but his ability to move away from players and into space should counter this.

Again height wise you are going to struggle he is only 5'9'', and lastly you will struggle to score a lot outside the box, only 68 long shots and 74 shot power. However saying that i did score two beautiful free kicks with him.


**Hybrid Possibilities** - If you are going to play his guy and Reus at ST in most formations you will be fine because it will always get perfect 9 chemistry opening you up to almost every single permutation of hybrid.

**Best Position** - Defiantly CF but still a world class CAM. Wasted at CM, CDM and ST though.

1361762916.0	1965r1	My Weekend With Messi. (Player Review)	ChedduhBob	13	0	9	"I got incredibly bored with Ultimate Team just due to the fact that I have played so much I have used just about every player in the game (Barring TOTY players and Ronaldo's Regular card). I decided to sell my team entirely and just buy Messi and eventually i traded my way up to this beast through some ridiculous deals http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/6397198/ so anyways without further adieu here is my review.

Messi is the best player I have used in Ultimate Team this year. He is hands down the best dribbler, the quickest striker and the most clinical finisher in the game. If the ball is on his left foot within 25 yards you may as well count the goal. He has an absolutely ridiculous amount of bend on his finesse shot and he can drive the ball into the top cornerevery time. His long shots are fairly decent, but there are much better players for those (See Arjen Robben, Schweinstegger, etc.) If you use him i would reccomend a Cam or CF role because at striker you're kind of cutting his passing short. The last thing I will say about his skills is that his free kicks are underrated, but they are absolutely phenomenal. I don't want to brag, but i am pretty clinical with free kicks within 25 yards and players like Ribery, Nasri and IF Diego are the types of players i like to use, and Messi performs very similar to them. His free kicks and corners are beautiful.

Now sadly the card isnt without its flaws. This first problem is a bit of a personal one, but when I use him i force feed him the ball. I just feel like i payed 1.3 million (Xbox) he should be the one getting the ball all the time. The next problem I had was those one out of every five games where the opposing team could stab a player and only get a warning. He cannot handle a physical defense, especially the refs that are really lenient on the foul calls. Lastly, the opposing players play completely different. When they see you have messi the first thing that they do is send you a series of messages asking how you got him, and then they freak out if you lose. I am an above average player, but i lose in division one every now and then. The people act like they just won a Champions League final and they proceed to give you shit talking that rivals a Joey Barton twitter tirade. Plus for those of you that dont like ""Sweaty Goals"" Brace yoursleves. Messi is an open invitation. 

One more final note, a lot of people complain about his weak foot. In my experience his weak foot is more than enough. you wont be mashing in shots from 45 yards out, but his finesse is still incredible. The way they do weak foot is the star indicates a percentage of the regualr stats. I dont know some exact ratio, but for the sake of the post lets just say each star is 20% of the regular stats. 60% of Messi's shooting stats is still incredible.

TL;DR Phenomenal player, a better CF/CAM than striker. A little weak, and makes people play like ""douche bags"" if you dont like ""sweat"". Plus expect pestering messages. 9.5/10"	t5_2uh1s	True

My opinion is that  Balotelli is a lot more of a quality striker and a lot lot better than aguero. He has the finishing, long shot, speed, dribbling, strenght, heading. Aguero just have the dribbling and finishing. 88 pace on the card is like 81 and balotelli is so much faster. 

Aguero is very weak and looses the ball often against defenders very often. The best thing hes got is his dribbling and finishing. But these two tools is not even near the 120k and hes not an allrounded striker, strikers like Torres, Tevez, Podolski is much better and worth 100k less.

It got me thinking 1) Who has 7mil and where did they get all those coins?  and 2) What is the real world value of Messi in FUT?

If anyone will answer 1, I'd appreciate it.

But for 2, I checked and see that 200k coins goes for around $42.  7,000,000 / 200,000 = 35.  So, you have $42*35 = $1470.

He steals the ball right away and scores in the 8th, prompting another message, ""are u now???"". Now I'm getting a little irritated, and I win a penalty in the 17th and he goes down a man. As luck would have it, he saves my penalty and lo-and-behold, another message, ""how about now?"".

Then things picked up a bit. I scored in the 29th, 34th, 39th, 49th, 66th, 80th, and 90th. I just tore his team apart like it was nothing. He got one in the 76th, but something just kind of clicked and I had this huge rush of adrenaline.

I felt like this and started searching for strikers with good heading and jumping. I used TOTS Michu, TOTS Mbokani, Falcao, Davies and Villa not finding any joy with any of them in the air mostly due to their height. That is when I found Caracciolo, the Italian striker playing for Brescia in Serie B who I believe is the best header in the game, bar none, 87 heading (Feels so much better), 92 jumping, 194cm tall, 84 strength (Feels so much higher due to height). Not many other players have the height, jumping and heading that he has. His 60 pace feels around a low 70's, which combined with strength isn't terrible, his dribbling is quite bad but his shot is fucking lethal also, his heading is just out of this world. Any ball crossed in, he makes it his, unlike other target men who only head a perfect cross he will jump backwards, dive forwards, anything to get his head on the ball. The only other player who is comparable at all is TOTS Mandzukic and SIF Klose. So please, if you're getting bored of the normal FIFA give this man a go.	t5_2uh1s	True

    and that you are wanting 9 chemistry (which you should be)  
  
Right. Let's say your player is a centre back - [Chiellini, for example.](http://gyazo.com/fe70c14c8879fa95f2889ef5eeda2210.png)  
He has four links:  

* To the LB  
* To the GK  
* To the CDM  
* To the other CB  
   
If you want him to get 9 chemistry, you have to give him 4 'points'. One for each link.  
Here's how to get points from the players he's linked to:  
  
* For 1 point - someone from the same league  
* For 1.5 points - someone from the same team  
* For 1.5 points - someone from the same nation  
  
[Here, he gets 0 chemistry ](http://gyazo.com/72faecd59478ab18aba6db378fabbdaa.png)because he has no links with any of the players.  
[Here, he only gets 7 chemistry.](http://gyazo.com/e39bc4d21e63a90d50d226964e5c3dde.png) That's because he only has 3 points - 1.5 from both the LB and GK because they're from the same nation.  
[Here, he gets 9 chemistry ](http://gyazo.com/640fabd1d73fa2061d55a27893062c32.png)- despite having three red links - that's because De Ceglie is from the same league (1), the same nation (1.5), and the same team (1.5).

Hi guys,

Packing up ultimate team and planning on doing a giveaway at 3pm GMT today. Will be giving away players (some decent IFs, not exactly Messi and Ronaldo but definitely some good players if you haven't invested lots of time into the game!).

Plan is, if you can guess the player first it is yours. I'm going to kill two birds with one stone as I've been tasked to increase activity on https://twitter.com/oddslife, so the plan is this. Follow @Oddslife, Ask yes or no questions, I'll respond via twitter and first to ask is it such and such a player gets it :)

E.g is he English, does he play for Arsenal, is it IF Jack Wilshere. That kinda thing.

Player 1 is at 3pm GMT, hope to see you there.. could be fun and with not that many people doing it you'll have a good chance! If it's successful I'll do a few.

Thanks.

My biggest gripe about Fifa has been the regen players in career mode. I start any kind of career and about 5-7 seasons in, players who are in their prime today are still the starters several seasons down the road. When *most* players get over ~32 they start getting pushed out of the first team and regress. In Fifa you have players still being starters until they are their late 30's. Reason being? Regen's and young players don't progress enough to push them out. Regen's have always been just awful in this game and I'm wondering if there has been any improvement? Sure Fifa creates regen so you can play several seasons down the line, but the quality of the regen's are just awful. It just creates a bunch of average players to fill rosters. Start a career you have average squad ratings in the 80's and 90's, couple years down the road with regens starting to take over it's hard to break 80 average rating. The over all quality of the teams you plays decreases insanely. I wish the regen of players in this game was as good as Football Manager in that aspect.

My other question had to do with Be a Pro. I like to create a player and start him at 15-16 and play him out, transferring to teams, etc. It sounds like they have made improvements to allowing him to get called to the International Squad, boss, and possibly other improvements. Some of the major flaws with it though was no matter your energy level, you were NEVER sub'ed from a game. My player would be dead at half, and would still have to crawl around for another 45 minutes. The AI never subbed you which was stupid. Did they make any other improvements to the Be a Pro aspect of the game besides linking international teams to it?"	t5_2uh1s	True

(Player Review/Squad Builder)	ChedduhBob	14	3	27	"After the BPL team of the season left packs the scramble to get rid of all of the players so people could open some packs for the Bundesliga TOTS gave me an opportunity to get some crazy deals while trading. I managed to pick up a TOTS Santi Cazorla for incredibly cheap, but instead of selling I thought I would just treat myself to a nice squad with him at the helm. I also noticed that Arteta would give me an incredible strong link and I could throw in Martinez as well to give me good links to feature Ramos and Robben. So without further adieu here is the squad that has one me about 14 matches in a row while using them.

Before the review here is the squad: http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/11045054/#

So Casillas in goal was one that I hadn't ever used before. I will say that he isn't much better than Neuer or Cech, or any other GK that is pretty high rated. I kind of reccomend him, but he isn't a must use player for me.

The back 3 of Ramos, Pepe and Boateng are a wall. I like having Ramos in the middle, because the high offensive workrate doesn't punish you. He acts almost like a deeper lying CDM and his 75 passing gets felt a little more. Pepe has always been a fantastic CB in FUT and Boateng and Pepe won't push forward so they build a sort of shell around the keeper, which is something that I like.

Nani and Robben are both incredible. I highly recommend both, and you cant go wrong with either one. Both have tremendous shots and you can dribble for days. Robben can actually track back occasionally which is nice. Both have good pace and are great for making those late diagonal runs that let you cut in and blast it on their favored foot.

The striker combination is beautiful, I don't see that big of a difference for Di Natale, in terms of IF vs Regular, but I notice a huge difference in Balotelli. If you look at his stats in game, his Dribbling and Ball control have both gone up 5 and for me personally that is fantastic because I take on defenders with the LT+RT dribbling and LT a lot.

So now we are in the important stuff. Are the Spanish Trio worth it?

I'll start with Martinez: He's really good. The only thing is so is his regular. I can't really speak about his card that much because it is good not great. He doesn't have a great shot or pace (ZOMG YOU'RE A PACEWHOREEEE!!!!), but he is great defensively and he can dominate in the air. The aerial prowess is really only shown on Goal kicks because he doesn't push up. This isn't bad, but you just won't notice it as much as goal scoring. He can tackle anything and he can distribute the ball well which is something that I like a lot in a CDM. So is he worth it? No. He isn't that much better than his regular, and Bayern have a bunch of good CDMs in Schweinstegger, Gustavo and Tymo even. He isn't really worth it IMO.

Next is Arteta. He is the perfect CM. He has great dribbling for holding up the play, he has beautiful passing and he can blast in Long shots and free kicks. He has good but not great defensive stats, and he has good pacce and workrates. I think he could play any central midfield position, but I think he works best as a CM. He can stay in a 352 as a CDM just fine though. I noticed a HUGE difference in his regular and this card. He also is really cheap for a TOTS so pick him up if you get the chance.

Last is TOTS Cazorla. My. God. What a fucking player. The Best CAM in the game right now hands down. He has phenomenal passing stats and he has the touch of a tempur pedic mattress. He can just cut in and out of a defense and he also has a good bit of pace as well. If you get any space, just press B and yell, ""RELEASE THE KRAKENNNNN!"" as you watch the ball bust into the back of the net with ease. The best part of this incredible shot is that you don't even need to waste your time getting the ball on the correct foot like you would Robben, or most other Long Shooters. The 5 star weak foot is awesome, and honestly I think I might like the left foot a little better. Cazorla is absolutely 150 percent worth it. I noticed a ridiculous upgrade from his normal card, and he is a must use if you ask me.

TL;DR: Arteta and Cazorla have a huge difference from the regular and Martinez is good, but the difference isn't as noticeable. Pick up Cazorla if you get the chance.

P.S. I would sell IF/SIF Di Natale quick if you have him, and I have since sold mine and swapped with the regular. He will almost 100% get a TOTS soon, so I can't wait for that."	t5_2uh1s	True

1363546232.0	1ah63f	Bit of fun, Make your own Team of the Season	morph15	11	0	40	"So I've been having a bit of fun playing around with the [FUT Head Player Customiser](http://www.futhead.com/fifa/players/customize/) and I thought It would be fun to have a go using it to make potential guesses on TOTS players and eat up a few hours of my time...

1362342618.0	19ld72	Hello EA_FIFA, I need your help (not about gameplay or a team).	nurriz	13	3	13	"Hi everybody!

I need to know the amount of points in each division for staying in the division, getting promoted and winning. I got the numbers for division 1, and since I'm getting relegated anytime soon I will probably get the numbers for division 2 :(

The background for this is that I'm putting the final touches on a statistics tool for Ultimate Team players. Being unhappy with the fact that you can only view details of your last 3 matches, I've build a site where you by the push of a button or 2 can input your latest result. The site will display your form for the season and automatically relegate/promote you at the end of the season (not the last part yet, since I don't have the numbers).

Its meant as a personal tool, so it's not like there's any verification of your results (not possible), but I built it for my self cause I wanted some way to save the data of my matches to see if I could spot improvement. 

Once the data collection is started I plan on doing all sorts with it. Facts such as your biggest win, most common scoreline, longest win/loss streak, what division you're in the most and so and so on. There's probably a lot of ideas as to what people would want statistics on. More ideas are welcome.

Right now it looks approximately like this: http://i.imgur.com/rG9RG8s.png

I plan on making a 2 click submission instead of the table of results. That is, you click your goals and then opponent's goals and that's submitted. I think that'll look cleaner and I don't have to have a large table with all sorts of results.

I also had an idea about attaching Futhead links for squads on your timeline, so you could track what team you did what with.

It might also be fun to do this for tournaments.

I have no idea if anyone is interested in this besides me, but I'd think that there are more people like me that would like the match history and fun facts on your game.

So I urge you please. Help me with the points details of the divisions and please comment with ideas for the site.

**EDIT**:
I think I got all of them now. For Ultimate Team at least. I skimmed them off Youtube videos :D

1360960985.0	18lltj	Dynamic Weather	tlam1996	13	2	12	"This is an idea I thought of the other day. I was thinking it would be a good idea for them to implement changing weather for fifa 14 or something. In my opinion, it would be cool if the weather changed mid-game. For example, it could stop raining or go from sunny to overcast because of cloud cover. It wouldn't necessarily happen every game, or every ten games for that matter. Maybe just a small change every once in a while that adds to the excitement and challenge of the game. Obviously, this could be implemented into all gamemodes, but I think it would be cool to see it in UT. Maybe there could be calendar at the main FUT menu showing what season it is and the percentage of rain/snow etc. The percentages would be small as to not get on peoples nerves, but the overall idea could add to the gamemode. For career mode, maybe games could be moved around or cancelled because of weather. Another thing might be that matches get stopped mid-game because of a storm rolling in or something. Also, if it is raining really severely or snowing, less people might come to the game and as a result, there is less cheering from the crowd that you occasionally hear in game. I think this would help add to the authenticity of the game without taking away fun, arcadey, aspects that many people enjoy.

This is just an idea and probably won't be implemented, but I wanted to share my idea.

1358520141.0	16tg1m	My Review of Ibrahimovic.	ChedduhBob	14	2	17	Recently I made it up to 1 million coins and rather than immediately blowing that money on messi I decided to build a nice little hybrid with Ibra just to see what he was like. This squad right here http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/4008408/ is the only squad I used him in so I don't know how he will perform in other formations. Anyways my opinion on Ibra is he is a fantastic player in FUT this year. Nobody in the game can match that finishing, that strength, that dribbling, and those skills in one player and that's the bottom line. He can rip shots that absolutely blow by keepers. The only players I have seen whose shots can rival Ibra's are Ronaldo and Robben. Having five star skills is also a plus cause if I ever get a lead it gives me something to screw around with. His strength is fantastic to, as he did not get pushed off the ball outside of one game that I played a guy with both TOTY CBs, which isn't exactly common place so lets just say no one can match his in game strength of 98. He is not without cons though. His free kicks for me were god awful. That insanely high power and low accuracy just make the ball soar over the top like a Sergio Ramos PK. Another thing that could cause problems for some players is I have found that you have to skill. He is not fast enough to get by a containing defender without some form of skill. Using moves like the Ronaldo chop and scoop turn can create holes near the box, cause if you get any space within 35 yards that is a goal. The biggest surprise I noticed was his passing. He will find through balls that are unbelievable and honestly I think he would be an excellent CF if someone really wanted him there. I think that's everything about his abilities that I can think of so lastly I will talk about economics. You are paying for the name. 500k could build you a phenomenal squad and I just don't see Ibra being worth it, especially if you only have the 500k to buy him. I loved using him but I just think there are better ways to spend and invest that kind of money. If money is no object I will say that he is one of the best attacking players, but I could probably score more goals with welliton. So goo luck to all of you out there I hope this gives you an idea of Ibra as a player in FUT this year!	t5_2uh1s	True

Also not too expensive, and a nice twist with the silver center defense. I thought it was creative and cool. Congratulations!  

I'll be contacting the winner with details on his prize.

---- 

As I recall last year there was an 11 nation tournament on FUT and it could be quite a challenge building high chem teams that worked within those requirements. So I made it a little harder than that for this challenge.

Requirements for challenge:

1. Must have 11 nations in the squad.  
3. Must be 9 chem across the board
4. Use Futhead.com for building.
2. The 11 nations must be confined to any of these 4 areas: 

* The Americas
* Europe (Russia counts as Europe) 
* Africa
* Asia and Australia. 

I'll pick a winner on Sunday. There's a prize of 5000 coins. You can be on any platform and win, but you have to be on Xbox to get the prize. Prize goes to highest ranked Xbox submission.

**To be clear. Your team must have 11 players of 11 different nations, but you can only use the nations of ONE of the 4 mentioned areas. This means, ONLY Europeans, ONLY Africans, ONLY from the Americas and ONLY from Asia/Australia. You cannot mix the areas.**"	t5_2uh1s	True

That's the squad I used (except for 2 games with my rest team). I just sold off my two gold squads to make this one as my dream team for UT. 

Aguero and Balotelli have 16 and 18 goals respectively in the 27 games I've played and they're such a fucking dynamic pair. Aguero is the slippery little snake that can weave through anyone (as I like to say, the first touch of an angel and the ball control of a pornstar) and Balotelli is the big bully that can break open at any time. Both have some of the most incredible shooting I've used in FIFA13 (I've used Aguero almost since day 1).

Santi plays right behind the two, and since I play on defensive, they're generally carrying the brunt of my forward play. Santi is completely two footed, and can pass at absolutely any angle. I scored the most insane overhead goal with him and also had one of the best assists I've ever had in the same game with him. I can't really speak highly enough about him, and I wish I could afford the TOTS, but for the price, SIF Santi is a stallion.

Hazard and Navas play out super wide in 352. Navas is pretty worthless, but I've scored a pair of goals with him and one was super nice. His longshots are actually really good but his finishing is poor and he seems to not be in the right place and is incredibly easy to push off the ball. Hazard is probably the best LM I've played with in 13. He's a diamond going forward but can also tackle and wrestle the ball really well for how small he is.

Fellaini and Xabi seem like a perfect duo. I think my next upgrade is gonna be to get TOTS xabi. Fellaini is insane all around, kinda feels like a better/taller/stronger Yaya. Xabi has some incredible long game and stretches the field quite well which is perfect with his workrates and his playstyle of camping the halfway. 

The way Fellaini/Xabi interchange in the midfield makes it really easy to pass it around with Santi and the wingers. You can form triangles at any spot on the field at pretty much any point in the game. All of them can zip it around and outside of rain it's so simple to retain possession.

Defense is a brick wall. Ramos can get loose sometimes and wander out of position but he can make up for it most of the time.  "	t5_2uh1s	True
1372712703.0	1hg9ks	5 at the Back: An Analysis.	ChedduhBob	13	5	17	"Recently FIFA Youtuber, Nepenthez, started using 5 at the back formations in his videos. I know some of you will sit here and say that it doesn't affect the community. It may not affect all of the player base, but it does make a splash. I have started to see way more 5 backs in the past week or so. I used to see one after every two or three days, but now I see at least one in each play session and possibly more. After seeing so many against me, I decided to make some and play with them. That will come as a shock to many because I have bashed the 5 backs, and honestly I think they should be removed from the game. I noticed a lot of things and I want to clarify some stuff I have said in the past.

So here are the two squads:
http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/12831631/
http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/12831538/

I made a silver team for the Silver tournament, and the other team is just for general games. I have lost maybe 2 games out of my last 30. I am good at fifa, not great, but for me that is a crazy win percentage. I can sit here and confidently say that 5212 and 5221 are the best formations in the game. Hands down. Here are some things I want to clarify.

Claim 1: THE 352 IS MORE DEFENSIVE
If you think that is true, you are ignorant. You may see a lot more 352 squads, but arguing that the formation is more defensive is just so wrong. Yes, it has CDMs, but if you just put two defensive CMs, you are covered. Then, you may be able to put some defensive RMs and LMs in there, but there aren't enough options that are as good defensively as a standard LB and RB. The formation gives you 3 attackers in perfect position, deep lying wing backs and CMs in a position to dominate the middle of the pitch. You have plenty of options attacking and you have more than enough defensive options. Your players are in the perfect positions.

Claim 2: Hold possession to beat it.
That doesn't work. I had plenty of people try and they would have been just as effective if I used  a4 or 3 back formation. I think that notion just comes from the fact that possession style football is honestly an extremely effective way to play no matter how people claim that counterattacking is the only way to score in FIFA.

Claim 3: It only is effective e on the counter.

No. It is perfect for attacking in every way. You have wing backs that will push up if you like to cross, you have CMs to hold possession, you have a CF and two Strikers to distribute the ball around, you have endless options. you are just being stupid if you say its only counter attacking

Those are just three of the things I see people say about the formation. I don't care what anyone says, the formation is the best in the game. I would like to challenge everyone that thinks otherwise to try and use it. If you have any more questions about it please ask. "	t5_2uh1s	True

When I'm the one controlling the game however I can't counter attack.  Do you see my problem?  My opponents just let me have the ball and I'm just not very good at attacking if I'm controlling the flow of the game.  Then even though I'm pretty good at defending my defense splits wide open and I get scored on by an opponent that had been able to do nothing for most of the game.

I just don't get how I lose to some of my friends that are worse than me in this way.  I know to keep my defenders back, I tackle both ways and block the ball well, I keep the ball and pass well, I usually spend about 1/5 of the game in the opponents third but these tactics just seem to work against each other and ai don't dominate.

NarwhalWhat	14	4	10	I got a little bored of just playing normal FUT matches with my team over and over again, so I made a new account, and decided that the only way I could get anything, players, contracts, etc would be by opening packs. It is really the most fun I have had on FUT. It is a big challenge and my main goal is to just collect as many players and teams as possible. I got this idea from Zerkaa by the way, so credit to him.

Any interest?	topher97fb	11	0	140	"Hi everyone, I'm sure you've heard of the recent scam that happened in this subreddit, and I would like to help reinstate the trust here. I want to set up a 16 team tournament. Now I can't provide a free entry fee like u/RedArmyDoof's Origin tournament, but the entry fee would be pretty low, at 5k. I will also put 10k of my own coins toward the prizes. The payout would be like this:

**First Place -** 55,000

**Second Place -** 20,000

**Third Place -** 10,000

**Fourth Place -** 5,000

Now, how can you trust another random on here? Well that's tough, but I guess the one thing I can say is that I used to be pretty active on /r/gameswap, and have 5-10 successful trades (I can't remember the exact amount). That is a sub where you trade games by mail to one another, so a good amount of trust is required. I have a good amount of fun putting on tournaments, so this would be enjoyable for me to host. So I guess my question is, does anyone have an intrest in a tournament like this?

**Edit:** First of all, wow! Thanks for the positive response guys! I didn't think that this would even get close to 16 teams. ~~As of 1:00 EST we still have 1 spot open.~~ **All spots are currently filled. Stay tuned for future tournaments!** I will start PM'ing you guys with the details on how to pay soon. After everyone pays we'll get some ground rules set, and then start as soon as possible! I'm excited about this guys, and I hope you are too! [Here is the current bracket!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ApwuhPTrt1endENlaHgwNFFEenp1aURIeFZRV1pIS1E&amp;output=html)

**Edit 2:** Ok here are the rules, feel free to leave any suggestions. 

1. Use any team you want, no restrictions.

2. Do not use any attribute cards on any players (Let's keep this friendly).

3. No time wasting. Just play the game, and have fun with it.

4. OT will go to Golden Goal first, and then penalties if needed. 

5. The winner should report the score to me after the game, along with picture proof if you can.

6. The higher seeded opponent will host the connection. 1 being the highest, 16 being the lowest.

7. By request, no black balls please. Switch to a colored or white ball to keep it visible for everyone.

8. Leave suggestions if you have any!"	t5_2uh1s	True

I call shenanigans and that EA has some code in there to fuck shit up during cup games. It's noticeable in literally every match. I get that a team will try harder if it's a cup match, but for the AI to play at that incredible rate and my players to play like they have their own heads up their asses is boggling.

Here's mine for Arsenal:

Szszszesny (can't spell it): 80

Fabianski: 78 (+2)

Sagna: 81 (-2)

Jenkinson: 74 shiny silver (+4)

Koscielny: 81

Podolski: 83 and a LW

Gervinho: 79 (-2)

Chamberlain: 78 (+2)

Walcott: 82 (+1)

Giroud: 80

I think that while our defence is a shambles, our midfield is doing great. Giroud hasn't done anything too special but he has scored and assisted quite a few.

Hopefully we can get these threads up for each team. The point of these is not to accuse people of bias. If you think a rating is unjustified, make your own!

Teams are selected at random - you hit random five times, and you play the rest of the tournament with the best team you were given.

SO the point is- find a formation and a league/nation that fits your play style. if you like 2 strikers, use 2 strikers. if you like CDMs, or 5 in the midfield, or 3 fullbacks, use them. If you like the spanish style, use spanish players. etc. Experiment and find what works for you.

I've only played from one PC and EA has not responded to my ticket.

What's worrying is they won't admit people are locked out of the game itself, only the Web App.  I can understand if it's a crippling problem that will take a while to fix, but there hasn't been a proper status update or acknowledgement of the scope of the issue.

I don't know how to link it in text, so there is the squad. Here is my review.

This squad is extremely cheap, and I think these players will hold there value, or they will decrease in such a small amount, they will be able to be sold after for minimal losses.

I will start with the defense first. It is very sweaty, but the true strength is the work rates. None of them will think they are strikers, and they all remain in a good position. Djourou seems to rarely be used, but I think he is just as strong as the other defenders. Wiese is a solid budget keeper as well, making this team difficult to score on.

In the midfield the two defensive mids are life savers. Gustavo is just a brick wall, and he has fairly decent passing so he can also distribute the ball around the team as well. Rosinei's America card is no longer in packs making this card retain its value pretty well, and he is just a beast player. He is basically a silver Ramires. The great thing about him is that he has 92 acceleration. That quick acceleration makes him great at scooping up errant touches by the opposing teams attack. Neither will be scoring great long shots, but from just outside the box they can smash one in. 

The two outside mids are very good at cutting inside and scoring. Robinho has five star skills making him a bigger draw for some people, and he has a great shot. Shaqiri is almost the best all around player in the game. He is incredible in every aspect of the game. He can score and defend, he can pass and dribble. Just a phenomenal player for the price.

Next is the attacking trio. Bermudez was originally a chemistry placeholder because I didn't like the options at CAM, but my God was he amazing for the price. He feels super quick and agile, has great dribbling and ball control, and what he lacks in strength he makes up for in balance. He has a decent shot, but he isn't a super goal scoring threat. If I could compare him to another player, I would say he feels like Nasri, who is my favorite CAM in the game. Next, is Quintero. He is one of the best 5 star skilling silvers in the game, at least for me. He has a solid shot and dribbling and he is great at setting up the other Attacking players. He has good enough speed, but he won't be blowing by people on the break. The last piece of the squad is what I truly built the squad around. Benitez is one of the best strikers in the game. If he had a halfway decent nationality that made him easy to fit into squads he might have been worth 150k easily. He is a pure striker in every sense of the word. He will be the final point of attack, and he can't really set anyone else up, but his stats make up for it. 90 finishing, 89 long shots, 91 shot power, 93 acceleration, 86 sprint speed, 87 strength, 88 balance, 92 jumping.... Those stats are unbelievable. He also has four star skills which is a great little bonus for those of us who like our ronaldo chops. He is the ultimate poacher, and like Rosinei that high accelleration allows him to pick up loose balls, only this time they can translate into goals. He can absolutely belt the ball into the back of the net, and he can ward off any defender. David Luiz, Sergio Ramos, Thiago Silva will all have trouble stopping him. Basically feels like Di Natale with 87 strength. The best part is he can be picked up from about 13-16k.

The squad is great, and there are some more options you could put in. Thiago Silva can easily be added in where Dede is, or where Santana is if you wish to change the keeper. You could easily change the squad to an all brazilian side if you want also, in regards to the midfield and defense, while still retaining the attacking trio. Robben will easily fit in for Shaqiri if you have the coin and the same as Neymar. I wouldn't reccomend those purchases now because their prices will only be going down more and more. Benitez also has a regular version who isn't bad as well and that will save you about 14-15k. This squad has room to grow, which is something I often look into for a cheap side. 

Cons: I guess Robinho isn't defensive enough for some, but personally I think that the CDMs make up for it. There isn't a great free kick taker on this team either. Robinho isn't great, and Shaqiri is average IMO. For many that may not matter, but I typically like to have one in the squad.

If you have any suggestions let me know! I love this squad, and is giving me entertainment while I wait to buy all of my expensive players back.

TL;DR: Here is a cheap side with some beast players. I love Benitez and you should give his SIF a go.
 Edit: thanks to  /u/eerhtmot Bastos in LM for a little but if defense.

http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/6050608/#squad-player

Ok, so the formation. First time using a 4-3-3 and ive played maybe 40-50 games now. and im still confused. I like the team, and will be getting casillas soon to firm up my defense because im not great at it. I wanted to play a passing game, and pass around the midfield, get a through ball and then go on to score. My problem is that i cant keep possesion long enough. i usually on have 2 targets. counterpart midfielder, xavi or fab, and benzema who likes to drop deep. Alonso is an option backwards usually also. 

But i cant work is when those are the only things trying to get open, the wingers are too forward normally to get any passes to them, so i have to use long balls or through balls and make them pace down the wing but iniesta isnt the fastest so a good fast rb can keep up well, and im not great at getting around players with skills. 

Ive been playing more of a counter attack game as of late because of my iniability to hold possession which has worked reasonably well, but fab and xavi are VERY slow so counterattacks are difficult if they are the ones caught high up in the field.

"	60s_Spider-Man_AMA	11	2	12	"I used to mostly play with gold squads but I would occasionally use silver and bronze squads too. There are distinct differences between each type of squad but I'll focus on silvers because that's what I spent the last two weeks playing with.

I have three silver squads but mainly used my Belgium Pro League one. I noticed right away that what kind of squad you create makes no difference when playing seasons. You'll almost always play a gold team since those squads make up the majority of UT squads. If you try to play the silver cup, good luck trying to get a match in. Past the first round, no games could be found over the course of 3 days at various times throughout the day (western USA).

In terms of gameplay, pace and shooting feel almost the same as gold teams but you'll find two glaring problems that make silver squads and bronze squads difficult to play with: passing and movement. You must play more carefully and probe better because passing is even more of a joke with silvers. My players would frequently hit one-touch passes behind the target or even fail to one-touch pass it and stumble with the ball at feet. This becomes an even bigger problem when combined with the lack of movement. Attackers with high workrates will still stand around when they instead could move into channels. It gets infuriating but forces you to really play solid buildup football instead of hoofing it. Hoofing still works against other silver squads but a gold squad will just eat up those through-balls. 

While the handicap affects physical stats, it does nothing to help with mental stats. AI-controlled defenders will perform noticeably worse than a gold defender. Attacking runs are often fucked up by stopping suddenly or not even making the correct run. 

When I changed back to a gold squad, I noticed a huge improvement in my game. Playing slowly was no longer a problem and because I was used to shitty silver passing, I was more cautious with my attacks and kept possession more. In fact, I started getting more than 60% possession in my matches. Everything was easier after dealing with the stupidity of a silver squad.

By all means, build a silver squad if you want a change of pace. You will be elated when you win but be quite infuriated when a shite player shoots a 35-yard long shot while falling backwards and your silver keeper politely pushes it into the net. If nothing else, you'll experience new players (Quincy and Sigurdarson are my two favourite silvers) and learn to play more cautiously. Veterans should definitely check out a silver squad if they've never played with one before.

Side note: A lot of people play Felipe Santana and Dede together in defense with no other chemistry links and they still do well so I don't think chemistry matters much on defense."	t5_2uh1s	True

After 2 seasons playing like this, I decided fuck it, lets make 2 teams, and threw together [one with a fluid offense and pacey defenders](http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/4324503/) and a [bronze](http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/3314866/) team. (I later replaced Jalal with Lloris because Jalal would block his shots right back into the box and give me heart attacks).

I ended up going 6-0-0 with the bronze team and 1-1-1 with the other team.  (Ok so I guess I didn't when it strickly with bronzes but close enough)

It just seemed to me that these top players aren't really worth it as there might be some handicap going on.  It definitely felt more fluid playing with the bronze team.  The other hybrid seemed to play better than my BPL team did as well.  It could also be that I was more focused playing with the bronzes because I knew I had less of a margin of error.  I'm sure the extra pace helped too but it wasn't like I was playing with snails on the EPL team.  Anyone else have similar observations when playing with lesser teams?"	t5_2uh1s	True

Not from all of you, but enough for it to matter. We've been talking about it in various threads and trying to come up with solutions that don't involve splitting the FIFA community *again* and so I'm proposing a little experiment. 

I've added the option for LINK FLAIR for FUT that will differentiate FUT from any other type of post. The aim here is that if you're looking for FUT posts, your eye will hit them easy. If you hate FUT posts, you're eye will hit the non-FUT posts just as quick. 

**AFTER YOU MAKE A POST THAT IS RELATED TO ULTIMATE TEAM:** **You will have an extra option under the *comments share save hide report* options that show beneath your link titled *flair*. Hit that up, choose the *FUT COINS* icon and it'll show that way in the subreddit. I've added a bit of CSS to *auto-flair* self-posts that contain keywords like ""FUT"" or ""UT"" or ""Ultimate"" and thus reddit should automatically add flair to any posts from FUTWiz or FUT Head.** 

Let's try it and see if it works and if we like it. Your feedback is welcome, as always.

_______________________

*NOTE: The color coding system (PS3, PSN, Playstation, XBL, XBOX, 360, Origin, PC, etc) that changes the colors of self-posts links that contain keywords is also still active. I'd rather not image flair all the things so let's see if this is enough differentiation for the community at large.*

The squad ended up around 1.190.000 coins.

Today I did the same check on all the players and the squad is now 100.000 coins cheaper. Especially a player like Bale, lost about 30k value since then, but not a single player had escaped drops but not even the IFs are safe from depreciation.

I know it's not very scientific, but 100k across 11 players in less than a week  is significant and lends to the idea that the crash is coming or ongoing.

I'll try and keep an eye on prices daily from now on to see where this is going.

1355120127.0	14lbe3	FUT Silver Frustration	GainesM	10	1	5	I have been a dir-hard fan of FUT since it's first release, but this one is the first to drive me crazy. I love building and playing with silver and bronzes teams but this year I've found it incredibly difficult. For an example, today i built my Spanish Silvers team and was very excited to use them until I realized I was in the silver finals. I waited for 30 MINUTES to find a game, but to no avail. I finally gave up and went to play gold cup because I HATE the attitude of seasons. I swear to you that all the 3 teams(before I shutoff my xbox out of frustration) I played were Brazilian pace squads with Welliton up top. And all 3 times the second I scored a goal they put it on ultra defensive and passed around the back the rest of the game once they were winning. I put it on ultra attack and team pressuring but every time I mounted an attack, the ball was held in the back for 3X as long. I waited a few hours to play again, and I waited for the silver tournament final, but again found no one. I can't even play this game anymore it makes me so mad. Why cant there just be single matches so I can play a fair and fun game?  	t5_2uh1s	True

In seasons nearly every match I play the ball is invisible, which has only started happening since the update and can be really frustrating.

In FUT I have won players in the trade auction, my trade feed confirms that I have won them, my coins have decreased the amount I have paid for them. The thing is they have disappeared from my watch list and are not in my club.

What do I do to fix these problems. Any help would be great thanks

I can fake my way through games against the computer on professional, but I'm basically just kicking the ball around and hoping for something to open up. I'm looking to be able to actually understand what I'm doing, and be able to play online and not constantly losing 4-0 at the lowest level.

Let me tell you about yesterday, when I was playing manager mode. I'm playing with AS Monaco, world class difficulty. Started from ligue 2 and got promoted by finishing second in the league. First season went just fine. No freezing, bugs, whatever. As soon as second season starts, hell is relased.

Incoming first league game of the season against Toulouse. I advance from 26 juny and eagerly wait my monthly youth squad update. Well fuck you, game freezes exactly to 31 day. Trying to press ps3 button to quit game, no reaction. Got to reboot whole ps3 by force pressing the on/off button. Thought it was just a one time glitch and try again. Same shit again. At third time I go to the full calendar and try to simulate past that date, and it works. Got past 1 day of July, wonderful. I advanced to the Toulouse game and started it. Everything seemed working good, until the game started, and I realized there was no ball. What the fuck. Quited the game immediatly and tried to find a solution. Quick googling helped and I started the game and changed the ball away from default to anything else. Well finally I got in game. 70 minutes played I lead 2-1 with one goal scored by one of my very promising youth player. I'm about to make my last changes and press start and you know what? Menu becomes unresponsive and I can't do anything. Everything seems to be working fine but I can't press any button or move anywhere in menu. My god I was angry at that moment. Quitted the game again, and started all over the same game. At the start of the game I'm listening things commentators say and heard that my team ''Should get promoted this year'' I didn't even know what to say anymore. I played the game, I won it 3-1 and my 1st ST got his elbow broken... Yup.
Went to see what my League objective really was and guess what? It was exactly ""Gain promotion"". Gain promotion? In League 1? What the actual fuck? I don't know if i get fired at the end of the season by not fulfilling that, but you know what? I don't even give a shit.

1351141681.0	121uyo	Why I hate FUT13 	ArabianNarwhal	16	7	37	Let me start by saying I've been playing FUT ever since the first one and loved every version except this one. In my opinion the biggest mistake ea have made is taking out single matches. By taking it out it destroys the relaxed atmosphere that previous FUT games had where you could just play a quick match that is matched fairly and it's fun. Now we only have the option of playing a tournament or seasons. There are lots of gameplay issues that drive me crazy but by far the most annoying part of FUT is I only play guys who only sprint down the wing, cross it near post, score it 9/10 times and it's impossible to stop. Taking out single matches means that a game always has something at stake, either getting relegated or getting kicked out of a tournament. This causes people to do whatever it takes to win, so they make an annoying, pacey, sweaty team and expose every OP thing in the game to score. Also, by taking out single matches and adding seasons it ruins bronze and silver teams because no one plays bronze and silver tourneys, only gold and seasons. I can wait 30+ minutes and never find a silver match, so I have to play pacey gold teams that tramp it every time. I loved every FUT but I find myself getting so frustrated and not wanting to play anymore. I feel like this issue wouldn't occur if ea just added a single match option. There are also lots of gameplay issues that have been bothering me. I constantly notice that defenders will randomly get speed bursts and catch up to 90+ pace players. I was playing my friend today and my 52 paced CM outran his 92 paced ST. First touch is also horrendous in UT. When I had my La liga team, I had players like Fabregas taking retarded touches ALL THE TIME. I've only had these problems on FUT, when playing normal H2H matches it seems much more balanced. I like the arcady feel of FUT, but I feel like mixing super realistic things like first touch w/ the arcady-ness of 45 yard long shots doesn't mix well. I just want a fun, balanced, relaxed UT where I dont have to play sweaty assholes EVERY game. Sorry for the rant, just wanted to put this out there.

Every version of FIFA seems to bring a lot of good features, upgraded graphics, more leagues, more moves, etc. But it seems that every year FIFA either takes away awesome features or continues to ignore obvious ones. For me, I loved the multi-season, multi-player be a pro career mode in FIFA07 (I believe it was 07). Nothing more fun than getting some friends together on a regular basis and play on the same team with created players against the computer, competing with each other for the right to wear the captain's arm band and competing against the computer to win. Lounge mode was great for keeping track of who's who among friends in local play (on the same console, PS3 in this case) - although I was always disappointed by the lack of statistics kept in the lounge mode. With the release of FIFA13 and the removal of lounge mode (booo!), I figured the reddit FIFA community could provide some feedback to EA as a whole.

My liga BBVA team stands no chance, not because I am not a good player (I was undefeated in Div 2 when I came up), but because every team I face is quicker, stronger and simply overall better stats wise; usually (almost always actualy) a pace BPL team.

1373802792.0	1i9t7n	Ok seriously, how to win corners/headers?	zyzzazz	12	2	14	"I'm sure we've all had our frustrations with corners and headers. When we win a tight game with a corner, it's deliciously satisfying. When we lose in the same manner, especially if the matchup was a little guy vs a big defender, we want to destroy our controllers.

So why don't we share our experiences on how to win those contested headers. Controls-wise, there's two main aspects: jockeying for position and making contact with the ball.

(Note I'll be using XBOX controller notation)

**Jockeying for Position**

* As far as I know, there's two general ways of getting your player to jockey and fight for position as the ball is in the air.
* Firstly, there's just the LT button, while pushing the left stick in the direction where you want your player to jockey or slide in front of the opposing player.
* Secondly, there's both the LT and RT button, while also pushing the left stick. The famous Youtuber AirJapes advocates this.
* Then you can either hold the trigger down vs repeatedly pressing the trigger(s).
* I've been using the spam LT + RT method, and it seems to work really well against the CPU. However against humans, and especially on goal kicks, it doesn't seem to work as well.

**Heading the Ball**

* Again there's really 2 methods. I've a feeling that one is much more popular and is simply instinctively used by most people.
* Spamming the B button (most popular?)
* Double tapping the B button, timing the second tap so that it is when the ball just reaches the heads of the players (bit hard to describe, I saw this one off a Youtube video actually)
* I've been doing the double tap method, but I think I sky way too many headers and am going to try just spamming B.

Of course, we can also go into where to place the ball on corners, side and top spin vs just top spin, etc., but that's really hard without visuals.

So what's everyone's goto method to win those uncontested headers?"	t5_2uh1s	True

I was inspired by [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/1hfpr7/fifa_fantasy_draft_that_i_did_with_some_buddies/) and wanted to create a fantasy style draft where each player would draft an 18 person squad to use in the tournament.

The order would go 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1-1-2 etc. and you could take anyone in FIFA.

The Champions League final is going to have a massive effect on the FUT market of Bayern and Dortmund players tomorrow.

Remember when Wigan players exploded during the hype bubble after the FA cup? http://gyazo.com/23648b41a195cdd5370a1554c0c3b8ba

Remember when Lewandowski rose from 2K to 20K during the CL semifinal match after he destroyed Real Madrid?

All the players will get a moderate bump in prices, but whoever scores first is going to see a dramatic spike and the best player(s) are going to see their prices rise exponentially.

I've been [tweeting in real-time about my own CL investing plans](https://twitter.com/paddy_dignam) at  and will be doing so tomorrow as well.

I would strongly recommend taking a flier on at least a few cards, because someone's price is going through the roof, it's just a matter of who (I'm banking on Robben and Muller, but that's just me).

I'm making this post because I have played with around 100 In-Form cards and I am convinced that a first in form card is NEVER worth it. I have always suspected this but I decided to run some matches replacing my in forms with the regular cards and I noticed no difference aside from perhaps better longshots.

I feel like second in forms plus are actually noticeably different, but perhaps are not worth the price. TOTS are obviously a huge boost and are the only cards I think are worth splashing the cash out on.

Post what you think about In Forms in here, because I am honestly curious what people who are more intelligent and articulate than the average FIFA player has to say about them. Have you purchased any first In Forms this year that have been godly?"	t5_2uh1s	True

I'm 23, I'm french (so sorry for my english) and I'm working since 2 years now on a project first called Electronic Football Championship. 
Now, it's named Electronic Eleven (branding inside!) and I'm planning to make it a start up company. 

I'm really keen on eSports, football, hardcore gaming ... and all that lead me to ask myself some questions, the main one being : What would it take for Electronic Football to drive as much passion as ACTUAL REAL TACKLING football can. 

I'm here because I think I did find one of many solutions so that one day, thousand of passionnate people gather around big events cheering for their favorites like people do nowadays with the Messis and Ronaldos (I invoque them not because Im a fan overusing them ... just saying ...)
Listen reddit, you're actually not the first one whose being introduced to this idea. I already did on others places on the web and Im suresomeone else did too! And the two answers I often get are ""Hey dude, this is a great idea!"" and ""This would NEVER work"". 
How do the last ones could know that as no one ever tried, as eSport is growing bigger and bigger as on saturday I saw the last FIWC french new world champion, Bruce 'The Machine' Grannec answering an interview on the second biggest news show in France ? 

OK, well. I'm here to have a real breakthrough in gathering people impressions on the first/upper layer of this project's aspects. 

I would allow myself to post weekly topics marked - ElectronicEleven - followed by a theme i'd like to talk about with you guys. 

As we go down the discussions I hope we could end with a reddit-version of what Electronic Football should look like, of course a bit driven and oriented by what I'm putting on a table but I'm really opened to discussion and to constructive criticism (even trolling destructive criticism could be fun to debbunk). 

I'd try to make these kind of articles as enjoyable/pleasant to read as I can but ... i said it ... im French! Nontheless ... I just love writing (as you can see by the length of this post). 

I hope you'll enjoy this big trip and I also hope that we will come up with some really great content (but Im pretty confident with that part;) ). 

So stay tuned for the upcoming topic (around this evening or slightly later) where we will discuss what I call ""A football-like universe"".

1352392218.0	12v232	Who's YOUR favorite non 5-star team on Seasons?	fro2short	10	3	44	"It's pretty clear from the Seasons players here that nobody likes facing Barca/Real. The only way to do that is to stop playing with 5-star teams (although sometimes 4.5-stars will get them). I've found online to be 10x more fun since I've stopped using Bayern. 

My favorite non 5-star team is Marseille (4 stars):

-Remy,ST. Any FUT head has at least one miserable story against this guy. Pace (93 sprint speed) but most importantly impossible to get off the ball, and great finishing. Oh and his jumping is 91 and head accuracy 86, putting him on par with Falcao's heading. The guy is an unbelievable poacher.

-Amalfitano RW/LW: Great short passing (86) and a decent cross (81) making him versatile for my poacher. I can cross it into Remy or create a play with his great passing. 4 star weak foot means I can play him on either wing, which is helpful for..

-Ayew, RW/LW. Another great leaper with a matching stamina level (both in low 90s). This is my Neymar killer as I often get matched with Santos. He is quick as hell and has unlimited stamina, meaning I can mark Neymar in my own third then lead a counter attack going the other way with the same guy. Neymar, McGeady...all of them are shut down when I have Ayew on their side.

Mandanda, GK: 84 Overall means he is by far the best goalie for a 4 star team. Reflexes and diving are 86 with positioning at 83. The Marseille defense is iffy and this guy saves my ass every time I play. "	t5_2uh1s	True

Im currently in Div. 1 and I consistently get 17 points or higher and it isn't that hard for me to win and I've won the title a handful of times.

The idea is to get people to use different squads, but when the only squads that can improve are the ones that are already the best, it defeats the purpose.

The first touch system is cool and I'm completely fine with it, but it feels like EVERY time I cut the ball I get mugged. Skill moves work about every 1 out of 20 tries, holding R2(RT) while stopped doesn't work anywhere near as good as last year, and I haven't really completed a solid Knock On to get into a good position. Pretty much anything I used to do in 12 to get past a defender 1 v 1 is essentially futile and results in an unholy breakaway for the opposing team.

Game 1 8-0 loss.  Two of his players had hat tricks.  To be expected for my third game of FIFA in my life ever against a solid opponent.

Game 2 3-0 loss.  Headers are cheesy, but I could never get Cahill in position for one while my friend was unstoppable with his corner kicks.

HOW DO YOU DEFEND CORNER KICKS?

Game 3 1-4 loss.  I finally got on the board at 9' in this with Henry tapping one in after a clusterfuck around the front of the net.  I switched to an all out defensive formation and my friend scored at 44' and twice in the second half (I am not being stupid on D either, no slide tackles every time etc.)

Game 4 0-3 loss.  The scoreboard doesn't indicate it, but it probably was my best game and I am feeling much more confident for next week's series where my realistic goal is to steal one (the Henry goal of game 3 was kind of BS anyway)

This time around, I'm focusing on the upcoming BBVA online tournament.  People have been trading this way since the first batch of TOTS cards were released, so unfortunately, I don't have anything particularly original or earth-shattering to offer, but I do have my eye on two players with great profit potential.

 I'm specifically focusing on Jordi Alba and Obafemi Martins.

I'm focusing on Alba because he's likely to get a TOTS card and therefore his NIF will go out of packs.  As an in-demand and relatively cheap LB, his price will rise as the demand for his card will rise (due to the tournament and general hype surrounding his TOTS inclusion) and his supply will decrease (the NIF will go out of packs to make way for the TOTS card).

I'm focusing on Martins simply because of his pace.  I believe he's the fastest striker in BBVA not named Messi and will be in heavy demand due to the BBVA tournament.

I'll be tweeting market updates real-time on twitter (https://twitter.com/paddy_dignam) and have a trading spreadsheet that I update constantly - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiLTXokCZbKMdDdYT1ZUalF0VV9jcmtBRkgtVXo5clE&amp;usp=sharing

Lobbed through balls are the perfect example here. No matter how good anyone is at defending, if a lobbed through ball is timed right, the defenders will pinch up, leaving the area behind the defenders wide open for attackers.

a second example, the set piece glitch. I've noticed more and more people completely ignoring wide open shooting lanes and opt to go stand in the corner in an attempt to win a corner (because tackles are broken) and then take a corner while the screen is dark and score a goal because it's impossible to defend

It's things like this that need to be fixed for next years title, otherwise It's the exact same game with a few more gimmicks added. EA needs to focus on making the game about soccer (football) and not about abusing glitches and flaws in the game that make it so frustrating."	t5_2uh1s	True

Ordinarily I would blame handicap and just say ""EA is a worthless piece of fucking shit how does my defense randomly forget to defend for a period of about fifteen minutes"". Today I was feeling special. I had just obtained the sex from the girlfriend earlier, so needless to say I was looking at life positively. I then realized that both of these players have the poacher trait and I started to wonder, was my keeper just smacking the ball at his striker because he was playing like a retard, or were those balls being smacked to the striker because they had the poacher trait. It also got me to thinking about other traits like finesse shot, power header, long passer, long shot taker, early crosser, etc. For example, a player with 99 heading attributes vs. a player with 80 heading attributes, but with the power header trait, who hits the ball better assuming same height, strength, jumping etc. If a player has 99 long passing, will he play better long passes than a player with lower stats but the trait. Last example just to hit the point home, a player with the finesse shot trait; does he have the same bend on a finesse shot as a player with 99 finishing? I don't know how in the world any of us could test this without creating players, and I know that would take so long I could actually do something productive in said time. Does anyone have an explanation/link to a source who does explain it? I just don't understand why they wouldn't just make the stat in the game be the only thing. I mean Messi has like 95 finishing, I would assume he would have a finesse shot. 

One last note: I need a tin foil hat though cause after the last 5 games I played, I am now a full fledged member of the handicap conspiracy."	t5_2uh1s	True

When you're defending a corner kick, you will usually have the bulk of your players in the box and **two defenders** near the opposing player taking the corner. Of the two players nearest the corner taker, the player closest to the **goaline** is usually a full back, and the player **further up field** is usually an attacker. 

Select the player further up and send him up field along the sideline as high as you can. Ideally, this player will be at the midfield line on the edge of the field that the corner is being taken from. 

When the corner kick is taken, direct your players to head the ball to your full back that should be near the player taking the corner. When the player near the endline receives the ball, have him send it up field (through ball, cross, chip through ball) to the player you've sent up field. 

The up field attacker should receive the ball with no defenders around him, resulting in an immediate 2v2 counter attack. 

I've scored more goals off of this simple maneuver than I can count.

I still liked to have the heavy top of 3 strikers, so I went to the 4-3-2-1 after failing miserably with a 3-5-2 and losing close to 10 matches in a row.

A player propositioned me with a great trade from my perspective.  3 of my players (valued at about 150k) + 3 other players of his choice for Messi.  Desiring to engage the obvious scammer, I told him my Mic was broken so I could record the proposal.  I can't find where to copy/paste sent messages on Xbox.com, so I'll paraphrase my own comments.

HIM:  how bout mascheranno lavezzi and tevez for messi

HIM: sorry those 3 plus any other three guys of ur choice

ME: I don't have Messi.

HIM: i know u dont i was saying ur tevez lavezzi mascheranno and 3 more players of ur choice for my messi

ME:  So a 1.5 M player for about 150k Max of my players.  Bad deal for you!

HIM: ya ik im cutting u adeal but im getting like 6 guys so is fine u wanna do it?

ME:  OK, lets do it.

HIM: messi is up just put 2 of the guys of ur choice and 2 of the good players i picked on him and then put 1 guy of ur pic and the last guy of my pic on another card that ill put up and my team name is the sweat squad

HIM: ok join party so we can talk

ME:  My mic is broken, so I can't talk.

HIM: ok its fine

HIM: the other player u will put those guys on is a bronze center back from sweden the league is allsvenskan and he plays for mjlllsberry aif i think and hes up for 1000 minimum starting price just message me once u send both and i have to back out of ultimate team and come back in for ur offers to show up and messi is a 4312 striker he should be easy to find and that other player was a bronze in a 451 and team was mjallby aif

HIM: have u sent the trades yet?

ME:  This seems like a really labor intensive scheme for you to sell 150 coin players for 1000 coins.  Mind if I share it?

HIM:  its not a scheme? i seriously wanted to trade with u but whatever its fine ill sell em

DEFRIENDED!
-----------------------------------
Obviously, the scheme involves getting me to keep buy his crappy players from him at 900% markups in order to get me to put them in the 4 players for Messi trade, which he will always back out of.  The player he specifies has to be bought from him.

Anyways, thought this was more funny than scary...

In a very well played match between DuB x All Stars (HuMaJuMa) and Dinamo Vitved(nurriz) we had to wait to the last minute to find a winner. DuB x All Stars quickly went one up in the 6th minute when [Rafael van der Vaart](http://www.ea.com/uk/football/videos/ugc/138923036) rose on the corner and headed the ball in.

It didn't take more than 20 minutes though until Dinamo Vitved responded, also on a corner. It was the defenders coming out of the wood works as [Mats Hummels](http://www.ea.com/uk/football/videos/ugc/138923155) headed the ball in and made the game level.

From there on it was a game going back and forth, with Dinamo Vitved having the majority of the possesion, but DuB x All Stars being the most dangerous on goal. It was still all level right up to the last minute when [Eden Hazard](http://www.ea.com/uk/football/videos/ugc/138923281) showing great skill on the ball curled it past Lloris who could only get a finger on it.

The 89th minute stunner from Hazard proved to be the last, and DuB x All Stars were victorious.

The rules are simple. You can field any team you want. Be a âpacewhoreâ, âBraskillianâ, âBronze heroâ or âIF collectorâ, I donât care, all teams are go.

It is a single elimination tournament, starting at 7pm/19:00 CET on saturday the 13th of October 2012. [Time zone link](http://bit.ly/USOWF2).

There will be a maximum of 8 participants in this tournament. If fewer sign up (as of 4pm saturday), the tournament will be cancelled. If more sign up, I might expand it to 16 players. This will make the tournament play an hour longer (7pm-11pm).

First matches will kick off at 7pm and brackets will be published no later than 6pm. There will be a dedicated thread on http://reddit.com/r/EA_FIFA for the tournament.

When you sign up, be sure to give your reddit username as your team name. I will validate your registration on the tournament with your info on reddit, so mind your inbox. This is done to ensure players are serious about showing up.

The tournament is run via Challonge!. The sign up link is [here](http://challonge.com/tournaments/signup/wcan6grozc). First come, first served.

As soon as you know your opponent, please contact them in order to set up your match. Add each other on XBL and play the match as a friendly, using the ""Play a friend online"" option in FUT. The players are responsible for arranging and playing the matches. I am only here to settle disputes.

----

**Time plan:**

* First round: 7pm
* Semifinals: 8pm
* Finals: 9pm

You have one hour to finish your match. If you aren't able to get hold of your opponent within 15 minutes from the starting time, contact me and I'll find you a new opponent or send you on in the tournament.

When your match is finished, please report the score on the Challonge! site. Players are encouraged to take a picture of the end game score screen with the scores and teams visible (use your mobile phone or a digital camera). This will be needed in case of disputes, so do it for your own sake. Both players should do this. If there is dispute over the result, only players with screenshots will be heard.

***If you haven't got a phone or a camera to take a picture, please consider not registering for the tournament.***

Disconnects earn you an automatic loss. Please document disconnects if they happen (picture) and come to me for settling the match.

**Prize:** 

10.000 coins goes to the winner and a mention in the sidebar on /r/EA_FIFA!

1349484419.0	110s5c	Ultimate Team... Stuck in a slow grind making no coins. Am I missing something?	igotmyxomatosis	7	0	32	"So about a week or so ago I made a thread on here asking for advice cause I've never played Ultimate Team. I got some great advice and made a pretty solid Russian squad. Not the greatest team in the world, but very fun and I can stay competitive with about 60-70% of teams I run into.

The problem is I keep running into guys who have squads where each player is worth more than my entire squad doubled. Obviously the plan is to move on from this Russian squad; hopefully to a German or Italian team. However, I'm just stuck in a slow grind making no coins. Seems like most of my match earnings go back into paying for contracts/consumables.

When I made the first thread I had 20k to work with, and I have slooowly grinded my way back up to 20k. How the hell do so many guys make so much coins? I play a match and get 500 coins, with an eventual season win here and there, but it's not amounting to anything.

Am I missing something??? Is working the trade market the only possible way to make anything? Unfortunately I can't wrap my head around the market for the life of me."	t5_2uh1s	True
1349471365.0	110g96	How do i get a better rating in pro drop-in as a CAM/midfielder? (positional related)		9	2	16	"Besides scoring goals or getting an assist.  My rating just constantly goes down.  I try to run to where the arrows go, but even when I get there my rating will go down everyonce in a while.  I try to cover the dudes in the red circles but that doesnt really keep my rating from decreasing either?

Where the fuck am i supposed to go? lol. And im offscreen most of the time even if i have the camera set to co-op. Plus like your team turns the ball over infront of the goal and all of a sudden it expects me to be across the midfield line and lowers my rating.  "	t5_2uh1s	True

Then my attack unfolds, they start talking about the game again and right after possession changes feet (haha!), they go, like, ""Back on the point of Barcelona replica kits..."" (not gonna spoil the rest, but it's quite a gem) and on and on. Had me go ""WTF, this is AWESOME!""

Does anyone know if this was a bug, or do you have to use that money right away? I know it says it can only be used once per season (the Financial Takeover prize I mean), but I figured you would keep the money until it was spent at least."	t5_2uh1s	True

Near  the end of the match, the opposition lobbed a ball that was heading towards me. In FIFA 12, I would press the triangle button (I think Y on Xbox), and the keeper would run towards the ball, and would drop and hold it. Yesterday however, he just charged at the ball eventually running past it which led to an embarassing own goal.

I nearly scored in the first 5 minutes, and the other guy quit at 3:50.  The next screen says I still have 1 game left, but then when I clicked through that it said ""Congrats you have remained in the same division.""  So it actually counted the game against me, without awarding me a win or even a draw despite it being 0-0.  It's not a huge deal, but kind of annoying.

Maybe the commentator said something about how I could win the title and my opponent decided to be a dick?  Is that a thing now?  I stopped playing FUT for a few months."	t5_2uh1s	True

PLEASE CHECK THIS TO SEE WHO YOU ARE PLAYING IN THE PRELIMINARIES OR GROUPS. PLEASE ADD THE PEOPLE YOU NEED TO PLAY AND PLAY THE GAMES ASAP! The names were picked using a random name generator, the first name picked was the home, the second the away team, third the prelim 2 home etc... the final 11 names were entered into the group stages. From there the ""prelim 1-5 winners"" were added to the list of 11 and the groups were drawn. You may compete group stage matches before the preliminary rounds are completed, in fact do so! It will quicken the tournament up. Seeing as there are 21 people entered, that is a total pot of 105k before tax, after tax this is 99.75k. I'll round this to 100k and the rewards are as follows.

1st:70k
2nd:15k
3rd:10k
Top Scorer (Team Combined): 5k
Most Conceded: A lesson in defending by me.

Once a game has been completed, won, lost or drawn, you must send me the links to all of the pictures through imgur preferably. Only then can i sort out the rest. I would like to ask that the preliminary rounds are played by the 7/8/13 if possible, with a final closing date of 9/8/13. Anyone who hasn't completed the game by then will be disqualified, if you have tried to make contact and organise the game, with proof of this you will be put through

This is the final post for the tournament, the rules are:

No Attributes.

Disconnections to be replayed to where the disconnection occurred with the previous score.

Pictures or videos to be taken for proof of everything, especially final score and match details!

The ideal photos to be taken are: In the prematch when you have both connected, this allows for GamerTag and Team name to be identified, the viewing of the opponents team before the match, the half time match details, full time match details, full time score (on menu where you leave the game). EXTREMELY IMPORTANT! Take a picture of the leaving match screen if a disconnection occurs, then take another picture of the point of recommencing the match, and the other details above.

There will be no ""best third place"" spots available, only the top two teams in the group will go through.

Time is up! If you haven't purchased the card now with the exception of ethaaaaan who has until 5pm GMT as i wasn't online. The draw will be made and announced soon, ethaaaaan will be put in the preliminary rounds automatically and if he doesn't pay by 5GMT his opponent will go through.

Instead of sending messages now, i'll reply to your comment with the player details, please purchase only the player i replied to your comment. Once that played is bought you will be entered.

Here we go then, from the previous post it was decided that it would be a Group then Knockout format with a 5k buy in. Depending on if there is an odd number of people, there may have to be a preliminary round before the group stages to even it out, and then depending on how easily the amount of people fit into the next round (2,4,8 etc.) there may be a best 3rd place(s) available so watch your goal difference! The draw will be made by entering all of the names at random. The main details will be on the next post with all the fixtures and results being put on there so you can all keep updated, league tables will be published as well with goals for/against, Goal difference and points. Teams will play each person in the group once with the top two proceeding immediately. You will receive 3 points for a victory, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss. The game will end at the end of 90 minutes during the group stages.

To sign up, you'll need to post on here your Gamertag, Team Name, Time zone (and possible active times). I will then reply with a players details to which you'll then purchase to complete entry into the tournament. As soon as you're entered you'll be added to the list on the next post. At 12 noon GMT tomorrow entry will close and the groups/prelims will be organised.

So lots of people liked the idea of a tournament so I thought it'd be a good idea to get feedback on how it should be played and the buy in price and such, all you have to do is upvote the comment which suits you best, and downvote the other option(s) (This is because i know some people would downvote other options in favour of theirs so everyone might aswell do it!). Just a general guide for rules (please comment more incase i miss something!)

1) No attribute cards.

2) No disconnecting to earn a rematch if losing (Ill explain a bit more later)

3) Take pictures somehow of all proceedings in the game.

I think that's all but i'll add anymore if need be. By taking pictures of your opponents team, the final score, final score match details, score and time of disconnection (If it occurs). This is just to be able to allow for everything to flow smoothly and will help stop people saying ""Oh I won 5-0 but i don't have any proof"" blah blah. If you've got a recorder, please record, it'd save a lot of hassle! Disconnections will be sorted by getting the time and score back to what it was before the disconnection and then proceeding to finish the game. Also i know the issue of trust will be a problem for some due to what has happened in the past, i can assure you that it won't happen with me. But anyway, that's why the option is there for a 1k buy in, build some trust first!"	t5_2uh1s	True
