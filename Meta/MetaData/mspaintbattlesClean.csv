As a mod/mspaint lover, I have set a challenge to /r/photoshopbattles to a face off. They will choose an image off a post I set to them, and we'll duel it out. First ever cross sub duel since /r/Nazi meet /r/amurca (not sure if those are real, i'm drunk). The contest will start on the first of the month. I'll keep everyone posted as to the decided pic, but I'll need a good showing. Get your armor on, and let's show those elitist punks how we copy and paste. Upvote this for clarity.

In light of my recent post of a non battle paint job, we talked it over and came up with a new weekly contest (of sorts) that will be held on Thursdays. 

We are calling it the **F**ree-paint **A**ll-star **P**arty....or, as you may have guessed...

**F.A.P. Thursdays!**

One of the mods will make a self post announcing the start of FAP  Thursday and you can submit your image.

*""But hotdog, what type of images are we submitting?""*

That's a great question, Little Timmy.

Anything and everything! As long as it is an original MSPaint project, we want to see it. Draw a dog, a log, a frog, or a portrait of your balls. We are giving you a lot of freedom here.

The duration of the contest will run from Thursday morning until Monday morning (duration subject to change).

Let's hear any thoughts you might have on this subject in the comments and FAP Thursday will kick off next week (give you time to create something and I'll likely be getting shitty on the beach tomorrow to celebrate Murica).

Seeing /u/marmadog was the only one to participate, and contributes pretty regularly, I made him a mod (as I couldn't buy him pizza from another country). Welcome him to the ivory tower and make sure not to piss him off. I heard he once punched a nun for spilling grape soda on his sneakers. Yikes!

It's a battle where you have to post GIF's using MSpaint.

* How do i make MSpaint GIF's?

*Don't worry, we have made tutorials on how to do that, Check out [My tutorial](http://imgur.com/a/GFTpv), or check out this [other tutorial](http://imgur.com/a/8SxWx) by /u/watchesyousleep.

* What are the rules for posting GIF battles?

The rules are pretty simple and easy to follow:

1. In order to start a GIF battle, your post must start with ''[GIF]'' or else it will be a normal battle

2. Making GIF's in normal battles is okay, but all GIF battle submissions must be GIF's!

May your paint brush be strong.

And as always, happy painting

""Hey, the bot has been told he can let the thread go. In a few minutes the submissions become visible and voting is open. You should probably do another submission in your subreddit to notify people that the voting is open.

Note that the contest mode is still on, meaning that all the submissions sit at 1 vote, and order is random every time the page is reloaded. I'll lift this after a while, to let the voting get to a good equal exposure start (some of the submissions were at +3-5 before the bot got them).""

or **FAP Thursday** for short!

This is a weekly thread where **you can post anything you've ever painted** that isn't from an MSpaint battle. **It has to be OC.**

### **However, this week (in attempt to spice shit up) we will be trying out a theme. This week's theme is Western!** 

So go ahead, post as many self-portraits of your genitals (wearing cowboy hats) as you damn well please.

I have created an album explaining how to make a gif using MSPaint. Let me know if anything is unclear, and I'll do my best to explain. I am by no means an expert at this, as I've only done this once, but I think it came out ok.

This is a weekly thread where **you can post anything you've ever painted** that isn't from an MSpaint battle. **It has to be OC.**

This means that you now have an opportunity to show off all the weird drawings and stupid shit you've done in Paint over the years. 

So go ahead, post as many self-portraits of your genitals as you damn well please.

The most upvoted artwork will be getting some pretty rad paint brush flair. That probably looks something like [**this**](http://i.imgur.com/2MkWY0D.png). So yeah, make sure to get involved.

I am seeing more and more comments on posts that are not submissions. While some of the other mods might not be as strict as I am about this rule, it's something I think will preserve the foundation of this community. 

We don't have a lot of rules around here, so it would be great if you could stick to the minimal guidelines we've set. If you would like to comment on the post do it under someone's submission or make your own. 

It's easy. if you want to make a comment, but don't want to get crazy with spending too much time on making a masterpiece, do this...

Your comment ""[This post is stupid, and I think the mods are being dicks](http://i.imgur.com/rZUB1q3.png)""

Throwing googly eyes on something will always get you a giggle. I ain't even mad you called me a dick (cause I can be one from time to time), as along as you insult me in the form of an original submission. You can call me whatever you want (I prefer if you call me pretty, but I'll take what I can get).

Thanks for being patient with me. I am really enjoying the evolution of this community and everyone's participation. Without you, the masses, this place would be tumbleweeds and circlejerks. So for this I thank you.
