Hey Reddit, I am new to this so bear with me. I am going to make pretty long intro to this to answer the most asked questions and to clear some things. I have been playing RuneScape on and off since 2002. I have read some of the older reddit posts involving me and I know about the ""general hate"" towards me here on reddit so I was afraid to do AMA but I thought hey nothing to lose here. 

I strongly dislike SOF and some of the latest updates and some people don't like that, also some of my jokes might have went too far in the past. I am sorry about that. Also when I was close to 5B there was many posts about me so I can understand if it got annoying too.

I currently have no goals on RuneScape and mostly just come on to talk with friends so I got time to answer your questions. :P

I will be happy to answer your questions and please stay nice! :)

Also I am currently at World 3 Lumbridge Lodestone if someone wants to come hang with me but I will try my best to answer the questions here first.

EDIT: System update!

Going to take a break from RuneScape, I will back to answer your questions later today and tomorrow at least.

Thank you so much everyone for the positive response, I am so glad I decided to do this AMA after all.

I tried my best to answer all questions except some IRL ones sorry :P"	t5_2qwxl	True

1) “Noob” is to be restored in its position as the highest insult available.

2) The threat of being reported is the utmost threat one can make.

3) Castlewars must be packed in all worlds, with everyone at all times spamming “@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@” or variants thereof.

4) Should one notice a player that has transformed into a bunny, imp or sheep in Castlewars, one must follow them and ask incessantly “How do you become a bunny/imp/sheep?!?!” (delete as applicable). The bunny/imp/sheep is entitled to relish their position as “the balls” and may make humourous quips as they please.

5) Catherby fishing spots are to be a forum for only the finest banter one can produce, be this singing, discussing the current Champion’s League game or any recent topical news story.

6) Should one wish to bot (shame on you!), one must subscribe to the required Botter’s look: bald with a goatee, and green shirt/ trousers.

7) Should one wish to scam (shame on you!), there are a number of scams available: popular scams involve removing an item before clicking accept, free gem cutting and free armour trimming.

8) New players are fully entitled to follow around anyone of a higher level around and demand “Free stuff plz” or variants thereof.

9) Whichever server is elected to be the trading server must be full at all times, and falador gardens must be packed to the point that the FPS makes the game resemble a slide show.

10) All high levels are to be referred to as a “PC prod”.

11) The fornication-deprived amongst us may advertise their desire for a mate through means such as “Looking for gf” or “Press 123 to be my gf”.

12) The females/gender-confused males amongst our community may utilise the above advertisements as a means to acquire free stuff.

13) The price of unids (unidentified herbs, what later became grimy herbs) is 1k each and not a penny less.

14) Those who wear chainmail may be openly mocked (see rule #1) and/or stoned as they are inferior in every way to the plate armour wearers. 

15) The Fremennik Trials quest requires a raw shark for completion. Nobody may happen to have one lying around their bank, and must therefore be seen standing in Catherby bank requesting to buy one for a minimum of 5k.

16) Each bank must have a minimum of one player advertising a bank sale.

17) If one grows tired of reciting the same trade offer over and over, one may add new life to their offer using devices such as “glow”, “wave” and “flash”.

18) If one sees another player advertising as above, they may ask how they did it, many times.

19) If one should happen to fail in the production of a trade advert as per rule #17, they may be openly mocked and/or stoned.

20) Every world must have at least one player teleporting to Camelot, over and over again.

21) Should one be attempting to sell an item, it is NOT acceptable to set the price as “offer”.

22) If one is attempting to buy a dragon chain (RRP 30m) or similarly expensive item, one must expect to be inundated with trade offers asking to see the cash stack.

23) In an argument one is fully entitled to brag about their level 150 main. That, or one may claim to be Zezima.

56) One may dance in return for GP.

60) One shall type “A q p” followed by “w” and chuckle at the resultant image.

61) “Please” is to be immediately removed from the vocabulary of players. In its place one may instead say “plz” or “pl0x”.

62) If one spots a person sporting an item one desires, one may follow said person and ask “Buy your ____”. If said person is not willing to vend this item, the acceptable response is “nfs”.

63) One shall wear one’s fancy/ fighter boots with pride for these are a true sign one is “the balls”.

This sub is notorious for being unsupportive and petty. We can change this.

We all started this game at about the same age. We played this game instead of doing our math homework or meeting girls. Some of us later met girls, and some didn't - and that's okay.

My point is, none of us are strangers here. We share the love of a game.

Stop being dicks to one another.

...are kinda wrong!

I met my boyfriend on Runescape via Skype chat with mutual RS friends.  We've been dating for a year now. We met in person in October of last year. I spent my winter break at his house, and he spent his spring break at mine. I flew over there to attend prom with him and he just recently left after spending 3 weeks at my place for my birthday.

The hassle of buying plane tickets, planning the dates, waiting for said dates, and not being able to see him everyday are pretty crappy things to deal with. I know long distance relationships aren't everyone's cup of tea, but being in one with him is honestly so worth it. He's a huge part of my life; we talk from sun up to sun down. The time I get to spend with him is better than anything I could ever ask for. He's my best friend and I met him on Runescape. Fucking Runescape.

I know I'll probably get tons of hate for this post, but that's fine. The fact that I met him on Runescape won't change how much I adore him, nor will anyone's opinions. I don't mind the hate, I just wanted to share our story. "	t5_2qwxl	True

Also make sure to **VOTE**. If you don't vote, then you will be unable to access the old school servers when they release them tomorrow, and you will be unable to raid. I know it might be horribly shady and ethically wrong of Jagex (I personally have no opinion - only echoing some of the objections I've heard), but it's the only option they have left us to get RS2007 running in its full glory. [Link to vote... scroll down and press the green ""yes"" button](http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/rs2007-server)

**UPDATE2:** I have rented a Teamspeak server with capacity for 50 people. I can expand it up to 200 if need be.

Server: **hqspeakus1.teamspeak.net:18139** 

password: **RS2007**

If you don't know what Teamspeak is, it's VoiP software, which stands for ""Voice over IP"". It's basically a better version of Skype which will allow 50 (or up to 200) of us to talk to each other simultaneously. Download the proper client for your OS [here](http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads). We will be using it to better organize the raid, but I also hope to make it a permanent feature of our clan because voice chatting in big rooms with everyone there is just *fun*.

Anyway, it's been a crazy day. Going to sleep for now and I'll address everyone's PMs and comments in the morning.

**UPDATE3:** I woke up and people are yelling at me that TS is full. I increased the max slots to 200 so you should hopefully be able to join.

Ok, it wasn't working for a while because I hadn't reset the server. Should work now. Message me if it's full.

Greetings /r/Runescape, my RS handle is Wingman13,

Stunts 1337 started a thread in the official Runescape '07 forums that has rallied 40 pages (and counting) of support. When the servers go live, we will rush the Stronghold of Security for 5k gp, take a charter to Catherby, buy some stew in Seer's Village, and then do the Waterfall quest for the quickest possible combat levels.

In the words of our glorious leader, Stunts 1337:

&gt;Here is a pro tip: The waterfall quest has no requirements, and you do not need to kill any high level monsters. The reward for completion is 13,750 xp in attack and strength. Essentially, this quest give you free level 30 attack and strength from level 3.

The event will occur **Friday night**, at whatever time Jagex decides to launch the servers. It will continue for at least several hours thereafter.

This event is only the beginning. I have already collected several enthusiastic theorycrafters, and have messaged many more who have posted on Reddit. This is becoming a clan, and everyone is invited. Our goal is to collect, share, and utilize all knowledge of Runescape 2007. Any knowledge gained will be openly shared with the public, ultimately in a wiki format. We are not simply passive arbiters of knowledge, however; we will be taking an active role in the evolution of '07scape's economy through profitable events like the one tomorrow. If you have a craving for knowledge, want to help the economy grow, or if you just want to become stinking rich and powerful, then join us.

**The full plan for Friday, from login to the quest, goes as follows**:

* Join world 27 AKA 327
* Join friend chat ""Stunts 1337""
* Get at least 6 air runes from the tutorial mage by dropping them and talking to him again
* ~~Do the Cook's Assistant quest in Lumby castle for food needed in the Stronghold and general travel damage~~ Nevermind, the '07 version gives no food. Just cooking xp. We should still have no problem doing the Stronghold with just tutorial isle shrimp. ~Thanks **TheFrenchKid**
* Run to the Stronghold of Security and finish the first two levels for 5k gp
* Home teleport or exit the stronghold via rope escape
* Run to Draynor and buy 2 ropes from Ned
* Bank your extra gp in case you die. Keep at least 1504gp for provisions.
* Buy 6 earth and 6 water runes (17gp each, thanks **fragileteeth**) in Port Sarim or other rune shop.
* Take the Port Sarim charter boat (1,000gp) to Catherby (Alt: take the boat to Brimhaven Docks (Karamja) and then to Catherby. Saves 600gp in 15 seconds. ~thanks **lv100hax**)
* Buy 5-15 stew (20gp each) from the bartender in Seer's Village
* Run to the waterfall for the Waterfall Quest
* After the Waterfall quest, we will continue doing quests. Taking suggestions but Vampire Slayer seems to be a popular one. Stay tuned for updates at the top of the thread.

**Notes**:

* We are only doing the first two levels of the stronghold because we are likely to die on the third level. 5k is plenty enough to see us through this raid. **Amendment:** You may actually do the third level if you choose, since the biggest mobs only hit 8 hp out of lvl 3s' max of 10. Just bring food if you do. ~thanks **troaccid**
* You will probably want to switch servers and/or go to other shops than Port Sarim's while purchasing runes, depending on how many people are raiding. Just return to server 27 afterward.
* The quest requires 6 air runes, 6 water runes, 6 earth runes, and 2 ropes to complete. If anyone knows the requirements to be different in '07scape, then please speak up.
* There are lvl 84 giants in the dungeon who hit for 8-9 HP on average, and occasionally 11 HP.

**Quest Strategies**

* We will probably want to enter the tomb in teams of about 10 people so that mobs have difficulty killing us while we run past. 
* We can have rangers distracting the fire giants to eliminate the danger of being 1-shotted. Private message me in Reddit if you want to be a ranger. ~thanks **troaccid**
* We can have fletchers collecting arrows for the rangers so that they have unlimited supply. Contact me if you want to be a fletcher. 

Specific strategies will probably become clearer through trial and error, but if anyone has experience running the quest then please share all the info you can.

We are open to any suggestions or alterations to the plan. The plan as it stands is the work of several volunteers from the original thread, and I'm sure with the power of Reddit we can improve upon it still.

**All problems are solved for now, but check this space often**:

* ~~What is the max hit of the highest-hitting mob in the dungeon, circa 2007 of course?~~ **Solved**

* ~~Are there quick ways to level HP? Perhaps a quest that rewards HP or a lamp? We may need to level our HP first if the highest-hit in the dungeon is over 10.~~ **Solved. We should be ok without leveling HP, but if you want to be a bit more certain then train up to 15 hp and bring those stews**


* ~~What is the most efficient way for fletchers to collect and transport arrows? Should they be crafted or bought; if crafted, where should they gather materials; if bought, where should they buy them? Keep in mind that the arrows will ultimately be transported to the waterfall dungeon and the supply should last several hours. Multiple trips are allowed, but once we start there should be a steady supply.~~ **Solved**

* ~~How many fire giants must we contend with, and where are the safe spots located for rangers?~~ **Solved**

Theorycrafters who solve these problems will be added to my friend's list and may be chosen as officers of the clan. I cannot yet offer a station until it has become clear how many theorycrafters are joining the guild, and the extent of all your talents. You will at least be rewarded the rank of ""theorycrafter,"" which is above ""peon"" (rank names subject to change). 

**The Theorycrafters** - thank you for all your help!

It's harassment.** How would you feel if you helped run a company, and thousands of your customers decided it would be funny to call you fat? He has been the main person in Jagex people have been hating on from day 1, but this is too far. He doesn't deserve this magnitude of bullying. It's atrocious, and some of you should be ashamed of ourselves for all the shit you've been putting on him.

Reading the comments I recognize that I failed to really elaborate on the ""fun"" factor sufficiently when that was a major point I wanted to hit when I originally laid out this post in my head. My main lesson learned here is to actually edit and revise big stuff you intend to write. For a lot of good points and my replies, please see the comment section.*

*It is important to note that this is an overly simplistic analysis meant to simply illustrate a basic point*

**Intro**
---

One of the most common questions in this subreddit (and for people who play Runescape in general) is how to level up a skill. When asking for advice, many players request the same condition: make it cost as little as possible or, better yet, profit. On the surface, minimizing cost or making some money while gaining XP in a skill might seem attractive, more often than not that ""profit"" is just a big lie.

This writeup is not meant to explicitly describe the best method for a player, but instead give some insight on what methods a player should actually pick. 

**The Scarcest Resource**
---

Resources are basically anything that you might consume to further your goals. For a lot of skills, these are your raw materials like coal, magic logs, and torstols. Most of these resources are continually renewed in the game through player skilling or monster drops. With the advent of the Grand Exchange, these resources can all be equated to money since you can simply buy what you need. When you run out of money, you can go earn some more.

However, there is one resource that can't be replenished. You can't mine more of it, kill monsters for it, or buy it. This resource is **time**. To put it a little morbidly, every person who plays Runescape will eventually succumb to their mortality. Even if you subscribe to a particular faith that has some concept of the afterlife, I doubt you'd somehow get to import your RS character over there. That said, time is your most valuable resource - once it has passed it can never be regained.

However, the sly and wily creature that is profit will often try to deceive you and steal this precious resource.

**An Example: First Look**
---

*I'm pulling numbers from the RSWiki for the most part so there may be some inaccuracies*

pr0n00b wants to level up Crafting from level 70 to 90, a roughly 4.6m xp goal. They come across two possible methods in their research:

**Method A: Spinning Flax at Lumbridge**

*XP/hr*: 20k xp/hr

*GP/hr*: +157k/hr

**Method B: Crafting Green Dragonhide Bodies**

*XP/hr*: 186k xp/hr

*GP/hr*: -6m/hr

From a raw monetary perspective, the difference is huge. Method A *makes* **36.1m** and Method B *costs* **148.4m** from level 70 to 90. This large disparity is the reason why people might pick A over B.

However, this isn't taking into account our scarcest resource.

**Opportunity Cost**
---

This concept from economics is the idea that whenever you have to choose between mutually exclusive things, the ""cost"" of the thing that you end up choosing is the value of the best possible thing that you didn't choose. In a real life example, the opportunity cost of going out to watch a movie with a group of friends might be missing out on a live concert you wanted to see with your significant other since you can't do those at the same time ie. doing one thing costs you the opportunity to do something else. 

In the context of Runescape, activities are more clearly defined in their costs. Whereas the value of going to a movie or a concert can be difficult to quantify, we have actual numbers to work with when we talk about skilling. **In almost all cases, the greatest value activity is your best way of making money. When you do just about any other activity, you measure the cost in terms of how much you're *not* making use of your best source of income.**

**Re-visiting the Example**
---

**Method A: Spinning Flax at Lumbridge**

*XP/hr*: 20k xp/hr

*GP/hr*: +157k/hr

*GP Change*: +36.1M

*Time Required*: 230 hours

**Method B: Crafting Green Dragonhide Bodies**

*XP/hr*: 186k xp/hr

*GP/hr*: -6m/hr

*GP Change*: -148.4M

*Time Required*: 24.7 hours

Now that we have a more complete picture of how these methods work out, we can look at the true costs of each method. Comparing the two going for the same goal, method A costs an additional **205.3 hours**, and method B costs an additional **184.9M GP**. The way you should be looking at these two methods is if someone were to attempt method B, they would finish the same XP goal sooner, albeit poorer. So what can they do with all this extra time? **Make money**

With a difference of 184.9M GP and 205.3 hours to work with, someone using method B needs to earn **900.6k GP/hr** to make the methods break even. I don't have up to date numbers for making money, but I've heard brutal green and frost dragons are some methods that should be able to hit that rate. For skilling, farming is about the only solid option, reaching about 2-3M GP/hr for actual time invested.

Now the real beauty of method B is that you don't necessarily have to spend all that time doing the same thing. If you have access to a better source of income such as QBD (1.5m/hr) or kilning (3-4m/hr), you can break even even earlier (123.2 hours and 52 hours respectively).

**A Quick Tangent**
---

The reason why people might find method A more attractive is a psychological phenomenon known as **Loss Aversion**, which basically says that people strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains. In one study, participants were given a scenario where a disease broke out in a population and if nothing was done, 600 people would die. They were given two separate sets of options and their hypothetical estimated success rates to choose from.

**Set 1**

*Option A* - 200 people are expected to live

*Option B* - 1/3 chance of saving 600 people, 2/3 chance of saving no one

**Set 2**

*Option C* - 400 people are expected to die

*Option D* - 1/3 chance that no one dies, 2/3 chance that that everyone dies

The majority of participants preferred options A and D. The catch? Options A and C and options B and D are mathematically identical. The difference is how things were worded.

It is studies like these that help to illustrate our seemingly irrational decision making process and why it may have been tempting to pick slower, but profitable methods. Time isn't something that we're always consciously thinking about and thus it is easily forgotten when making decisions.

**The ""Fun"" Factor**
---

I can't ever argue for or against the ""funness"" of an activity. From a subjective point, people might just simply enjoy spinning flax or dislike bossing. However in that sense, one can still argue for the faster method. 

If you intend on hitting your goal using the slower method, you must spend all 230 hours doing the same thing. By picking the faster method, so long as you can make more than the break even income rate, you have extra time on your hands. You can use this free time to do anything you like, make more money, play Castle Wars, or go do non-RS related things. In the above examples of QBD or Kiln level income, that's **80-150 hours** for you to do as you please. All while still having the same amount of gold and same XP goal met. 

**Final Thoughts**
---

For a long time there has been a major schism between players who cared about more efficient means of playing the game and those who did not care about this efficiency at all. Once more, this is not a guide on how specifically you should get rich or get that skill cape, but how to evaluate any methods you might discover. Instead, it is my intention to foster an understanding of why efficiency minded players make the arguments they do and further close the aforementioned gap between players. I don't care what path people actually choose so long as they fully understand their options.

The oceans are pitiful ponds, cites are as small as villages, with villages been the same as a small camp, and you can see from one end of a [""kingdom""](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Asgarnia) to another. I mean just look at the pictures some people on this subreddit have posted:

* [Port sarim to Wizards tower.](http://i.imgur.com/MphAB6j.jpg) [[Thread]](http://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1cjotj/dat_minimap/)
* [Void Knight Island to pest island (A shifter* could teleport that far!).](http://i.imgur.com/20aC4Dg.jpg) [[Thread]](http://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1ck0q6/pest_control_island_html5/)

* [Runespan](http://i.imgur.com/q7SV7LC.jpg) [[Thread]](http://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1cjl79/from_one_plane_to_the_next/)

They show how tiny the world really is. It needs to be bigger by **at least** 3 times the current size. I mean, what is this, a game for ants?

We ran out of space to place things in the existing areas long ago, in the updated rimmington there are only 4 people living there with proper houses, where do the people in the quests appear from? Whenever something as to be added we have to raise up new lands from the sea to make space for them, or we end up with things like charm sprites.

We seriously need a much larger world now, and with the new draw distance **everyone** can see how small it all is. it's been too small for too long now, we have things like lodestones that let anyone teleport all the way around the world now for free, so traveling wouldn't even be a problem.

Although it is only a small amount of our player base doing this something is needing to be done about it.

Whether you are playing on the Old School Servers or RuneScape Servers, please be civil. 

We have lost over 1,000 subscribers in a week, and there is a large possibility that this is due to comments such as this.

As a consequence the ban hammer will be thrown around if people carry on acting like this, there are other communities for you to go and circle jerk in. 

**This is not a circle jerk community.**

This is not to say that discussion about RS vs. 07 is not allowed. Just circle jerking and general childish behavior will not longer be tolerated.


If what you are saying is just telling someone one else that one server is better than the other this is not needed and adds nothing to the community.

Don't Q_Q too much, as we have some other mods taking their love of Reddit and will be posting here on /r/RuneScape when I'm gone. 

Keep an eye out for the following J-Mods:

These are not rules, this is a just a helpful reminder.
 
* **Clue Scrolls** - It sucks that you only got 500gp from a 30 minute clue scroll but it isn't rare, as we've seen from the hundreds that have been posted. 3rd Age plate? Go for it. Ranger boots, Robin Hood Hat not so much.

* **Advice** - Bossing - Sidebar, Skilling - Sidebar, Money Making - Sidebar. For all other advice there is the Wiki, if after looking here you still need advice sure post because then it could be an interesting conversation starter.

* **Phishing Sites** - For the love of all that is RuneScape if you find a phishing site **DO NOT** post it. Report it on the Runescape [Website](http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/Phishing).

* **RS Memes** - Unless it's original content it's a repost. If you must repost credit the author.

* **Picture Quality** - Taking a picture with your phone and uploading it to imgur is retarded. Alt + Print Screen ( Shift + CMD + 3 on Mac) is how to print screen learn it, use it.  

**EDIT:** [This](http://i.imgur.com/Ft8kc.png) may be helpful. Thanks to /u/AlmostNPC. 

**EDIT 2:** (CMD + Shift + 4) is like the snipping tool for Mac thanks to /u/Chop_Hard

* **Flipping** - 5M Flip? Congratulations but in all [honesty](http://i.imgur.com/Wyva4Jd.gif).

* **Drops** - Just got a cool drop at GWD? Has it been posted 50 times this week already? We don't need to see that.

* **Some-one else got this achievement!** - Seriously stop Karma Whoring. 

All of these are from the current 25 in new when i wrote this. As I said earlier these aren't rules by any means just some helpful tips to help you when submitting here.

Thanks,

Hell, all the items can even go in a trashbin located in the GE where players are free to pick up all the unwanted items from other players.

What are your guy's thoughts on this? It might be lazy of me but I want some input on the idea.

EDIT: Another cool thing would be to have a ""Select multiple items option"" and each item in your bank would have a checkbox on it and you would use that to select multiple items to move, empty, etc.

I am still hacked. My registered e-mail address was changed, and am unable to access my account.

I would like to show you what happens when you try to recover your account. When you click 'account recovery', it will show this screen: http://puu.sh/3TLOM.png
So, load up the game.. click on 'forgotten password', then it pops up with this screen: http://puu.sh/3TM1O.jpg

MY E-MAIL ADDRESS ATTACHED TO THE ACCOUNT HAS BEEN CHANGED. There is nothing I can do at this point expect for e-mail them, which I have done several times, without success.

I am hoping someone from Jagex will see this and just help me out. My account in-game username is 'Jacks0n', and have been unable to access my account for 6 days now.

The purpose of this post is to allow readers to mentally sort out what did or did not come after August 2007. Basically:

* **Don't vote for the 2007 servers if you're nostalgic for old/original versions of anything on this list, or enjoy anything on this list. Remember that falsely inflating the interest in 2007scape (voting yes even if you're not actually interested) could have negative financial repercussions for Jagex.**
* **Do vote for the 2007 servers if you dislike the things on this list.**

I created this list by using [this](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Update:Game_updates) page from RSWikia, as well as your comments below.

I was a leader of the pure clan Fatality. I have been around the pure community since 2006 and have witnessed every era come and go. Never have I seen destruction on this scale. I can answer questions about almost anything related the pure community. (INB4 downvoted for being a pure)


Currently I am a main with 2200+ total so before you bash realize i've seen both sides of the spectrum!

Edit: To provide background in the past 2 weeks every pure clan has closed with the exception of Mayhem Makers, this includes Fatality/Final Ownage Elite/ Eruption of Pures/ The Last Pures/ Corrupt Pures/ Zenith/ and many others. These clans have all been open for a minimum of 6 years."	t5_2qwxl	True

Take this incredible screenshot of me at a bonfire...

http://gyazo.com/5ffbf95aeeec885e750f6547005b075c

This is a pain in the butt to look at for everyone, because it...

1.) Doesn't work with RES

2.) Doesn't work with Hover Zoom (What I use)

3.) It takes longer to load than an average direct link or Imgur page.

However, in order to make it less sucky for everyone, try linking it directly to the image. In order to do this, simply right click the image, and click ""Copy Image URL."" With that link copied, submit it to reddit, and you have a much friendlier link.

Same Screenshot, more user friendly.

http://gyazo.com/5ffbf95aeeec885e750f6547005b075c.png

See how much easier it is? Sorry about the post, it's just annoying to find Gyazo links like the first one, while browsing.

1366235654.0	1ck9kw	If you're going to scam some one, please make sure you're over lvl 68 summoning. (duel arena story) Be careful	jumpingsuits	184	14	17	"So i decided to head over to take a look at the new duel arena with a friend, while there we tried good ol' fashion boxing. We were happy how it turned out. While messing around with 1gp stakes like idiots we decided to go to the duel arena world and try our luck.

While looking for a good boxing match, we saw the usual quick add of main hand weapon tricks.Then i noticed one of them wanted familiars activated though he was advertising 'boxing only',we will call him Staker, i thought Staker would summon a titan of some sort during the fight , so i ran to get a steel and some scrolls. 

I returned to challenge him and said ""lets do this! titan fight !"" guess i gave it away and he declined my challenge.
While this was going on i told my friend (phill) what the guy was trying to do, so he quickly jumped on and pretended not to notice that summoning was active and staked 60m against the guy. This was the guys mistake.

The fight starts off and the staker summons, ..... yes , a bunyip, now when i saw this i realized right away what he was going to do, he had a full inventory of rocktails to use swallow whole scroll to heal during the boxing fight. 

Phill (who is maxed) summoned a Steel titan and started wrecking him faster than he could cast swallow whole scroll and soon died raging that he failed trying to dual arena scam some one. 

Anyways, if you will be staking please be careful of this trick or be ready to counter it with a steel titan and take them for 60m.

We began talking about miscellaneous stuff and it somehow led to us chatting about video games which led to a comment by one of us like ""Man, i remember Runescape, I used to play that. What about you Staff Sergeant?"" A smirk slowly crosses his face as he replies ""You guys dont KNOW about Runescape.""
""I remember back in the day man, I was actually the first person to reach level 99 strength."" 
""wow"" we both replied, ""what was your screen name?""

After a short delay he commented back
""LadyKillJoy""

Thats right Reddit, this entire time I had been in the presence of a forgotten legend. He (and yes he was a male with a female character) proceeded to tell us about countless stories back in RSC before he quit.

It was a treat to have experienced such an event and I thought I would share it with you guys.
If you have any questions please feel free to ask.

&gt;Now for some even bigger news, thanks to a truly herculean effort and much of which is still on-going **I want to pledge to open the Old School Servers to all those who have already voted (or intend to do so in the next week before the poll closes) on Friday night!** (likely quite late ?). We promised we would give players an option to bring it back and we are following through with that promise. We've literally, been working around the clock to get a version up and running for you. Everyone will start afresh and we are not expecting any roll backs – barring any major technical issues of course.

1366993271.0	1d5to5	Dear Jagex mods, i believe i was wrongly perm banned for using a vpn. I sent my appeal 90 days ago. Still waiting for a response.	iamintrigued	206	59	73	"&gt;**Hey there,**
&gt;**I'm not in the player support or ICU teams so I'm not really part of issuing or removing bans, but I passed your display name on to our ICU teams who have checked your account out and removed the ban. The VPN you were using is also used by a huge amount of gold farmers which is why our system applied the ban.**

&gt;**Take it easy,**

&gt;**Sabre**

**Huge Props to the jagex team for reviewing my case. I would recommend people to not use hotspotshield vpn while scaping as alot of goldfarmers apparently uses it too.**


EDIT: 43 days not 90. It is late at night here and i miscalculated how many days passed.

My rsn is kingkorea and I was banned on March 15th, 2013 with the charges of ""macroing goldfarming major"". 
http://imgur.com/D0I2BgI
I am(was) an owner of a max cape and my runescaping habits before getting this ban was:

1. Daily pops
2. Weekly Strange Rocks
3. Misc. comp cape requirements
4. Daily dg challenges

In the previous 1 month or so before this ban, i have not

1. Increased the net worth of my bank (goldfarming)
2. I have not traded a single player in that time period. All my rs transactions went through the GE.

I play rs sometimes with a free vpn which i believe means that other people using the same vpn might have the same ip. I tried logging into my secondary account (which i have only used for squeal spins but similarly have not traded a single player) xspelluserx but it was also automatically banned after logging in.

My problem is that, after i sent my appeal, no one on jagex's side bothered to reply to my appeal, either accepting or declining it. After playing this game for 10 years, i would have expected a common courtesy of not making me wait ~~90~~ 43 days for my appeal.

The purpose of this topic was not to ""beg"" jagex to unban my account(s) or to invoke pity among the people. I want jagex to look into my account and the evidence against my account and determine the correct action. Having to wake up everyday with no response is absolutely frustrating.

Thank you and have a good day.

edit: The vpn i use is called hotspotshield which is a vpn service that has a trial. The lovely people at thepiratebay uploaded a crack of the software where i can use the trial version indefinitely. I believe all the other people who use the same vpn with the same fix might be all associated with the same ip but i do not fully understand vpns so this is just my guess."	t5_2qwxl	True

I could be wrong, as there is always a chance to be wrong in these cases, but I have pretty overwhelming evidence that Gaping's giveaway is a fraud.

**Exhibit A:** [The lottery scam post in question.](http://i.imgur.com/H6Lagh.png)

Seems innocent enough.

**Exhibit B: Background Check**

Exhibit B1: [Background check #1](http://i.imgur.com/6Jnyph.png)

Exhibit B1 shows the first post he made (he only made 4-5 posts, and the account's earliest post was just a few weeks ago). The particular exhibit post was made only 2-3 weeks ago. He tells a sob story of how his brother died and how he is a noob on Runescape when it comes to making money. He made an attempt to delete the username he used to make that post, but he made the mistake of commenting on that post and including the name ""Gaping"" on the main post. And in his lottery post, he is claiming that he is financially stable enough to giveaway a santa hat, AND a party hat in the future once he gets 1700 (1700 of what? who knows). 

He tried to hide his tracks for this piece of evidence, but didn't do it well enough.

Exhibit B2: [He doesn't even have starting cash](http://i.imgur.com/2TULIh.png)

Commented on that same post asking if people could give him even a portion of a phat. He also claims he doesn't even have starting cash.

Exhibit B3: [He deleted part 2 of his Runescape story](http://i.imgur.com/48R9y.png)

He removed the second part of his Runescape story (which is possibly the story of how financially unstable he is, and possibly the story he tells people to get people's pity GP). 

Again, he tried to cover up his tracks here.


**Exhibit C:** [The problems with his post.](http://i.imgur.com/gNYOqh.png)

There are a lot of problems with his post. I point to each of them in the image of exhibit C. The two main problems (I point out 4 in the exhibit image) are:

* If he's planning to giveaway a santa, why would he need to make money back in the process? What's the point of doing the giveaway? That's immediate alarm bells that he's selling ""tickets"" for 1m ea. Any excited and innocent redditor could fall for it and lose 10M from buying 10 ""tickets"" from him. That's the main idea of the scam.

* Where's the proof of the santa hat and the party hat? No proof given. 

**Conclusion**

This evidence leads me to believe that Gaping is running a lottery scam. He gives people ""free entry"", but he preys on the fact that some innocent redditors will buy millions of GP worth of tickets.

Again, I could be wrong and I hate for something like this to have happened to the reddit community, but the evidence is pretty strong."	t5_2qwxl	True
