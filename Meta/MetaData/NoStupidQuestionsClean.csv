1376696868.0	1kirf1	How does going to a night club work?	hxx	148	31	31	"I don't fully comprehend the process of going for a night out. I want to know what the main aspects are, what about it makes people have a good time and what a typical person's goals are in going out.

As I understand it, first people meet for pre-drinking because it's cheaper than getting drunk in the club. It's a good time to have a laugh as well.

After some time of pre-drinking, people decide to head to the club, I'm guessing when they think it will be late enough to be full.

At the club people queue outside and have a chat while waiting. Upon being granted entry I think people tend to head to the bar for a drink.

After this I'm not sure what's supposed to happen. Some people dance, which is fun in itself, but it feels wrong to go there simply to dance as a man. Some people mostly stand around instead of dancing, I'm curious what they get out of the experience, it's too loud to talk properly.

After a few hours I generally feel uncomfortable that I've been repeating the same few actions over and over and decide to leave.

Is the shared experience of music the main aspect? I hear a lot of people saying it's bad.

Are most guys trying to pull girls? In that case, what's the procedure for that? Words aren't easily exchanged in that environment. Is it acceptable, even expected, to go up to strangers and start interacting with them?

Man real life is hard. I could totally master it if it were a computer game.

I'll see something on the front page that fits the particular subreddit perfectly and it'll have 12,000 upvotes, but only +2000 overall because it has 10,000 downvotes. Or another example is I'll read the perfect comment on /r/askreddit with x6 gold or something, and it'll still have a ton of downvotes (but even more upvotes).

Do you know what I'm getting at? How are there so many people that feel the need to downvote everything? I'm not sure if it's whether people have such dividing opinions on really trivial issues, or if there are certain groups of people just going around downvoting everything. Even if I think something is slightly stupid or I don't agree with it, I won't downvote it. And I certainly won't downvote a top comment that's just brilliant.

Rubbing alcohol usually has an alcohol content of 70% and is pretty fucking deadly. I knew a guy who did a shot of it once and spent the entire night in the hospital.

So how come there's no restrictions on purchasing it?

Zapatlela	42	7	27	"I've read a _lot_ on Reddit about how someone was living in country X previously and then moved to country Y to live a new or better life. 99% of the time, this is always someone moving from Europe to the US or from the US to Europe.

Anyway, I'm an Indian citizen from a considerably lower-middle-class family. None of my family members or extended relatives have traveled abroad. Me, on the other hand, have been very exposed to the western culture through the internet. Presently, I run a popular website and generate ad revenue (NOT adsense). So 100% of the revenue comes from foreign land. But I still operate from a small city in India. 

Is is possible for me to move to a different country and live/work there? If so, how do I go about doing that? I've heard that getting a US business visa is very difficult after 9/11, but how are the European countries? Are there any visa-friend countries as my options?

**EDIT**: Wow, thanks a lot for all your responses, guys. I _really_ appreciate the help.

You ask somebody what kind of books they like and they have no problem listing popular bestsellers as their favourites. But often they will say ""just not rubbish like Dan Brown"".

I get that not everybody will like that, but why go out of your way to disassociate yourself from it? 

For example, the Indiana Jones franchise of films could be seen in the same light. It's pure adventure; the characters are hardly complex; the historical stuff is questionable; and many scenarios aren't realistic but merely there to help the plot forward.

Right, so here's the deal: I'm 17 and I've been with my girl for 10 months now and the relationship is going great! Before her, I was pretty inexperienced but picked up what I had to do with foreplay and stuff very quickly and would now consider myself... Well, pretty good... The only problems were that I wasn't able to cum (from a handie or blowjob) unless it was me doing the jerking, so to speak. Also; whenever we attempted sex, I would try to put the condom on but my dick had gone down while trying to put it on. I thought it was just beginners nerves or whatever, but 10 months on I still have the same problems!
I partly attribute it to the condom being fiddly as fuck to get on, and a real ""moment ruiner"" as you have to break away from the action to put it on, but that can't be it entirely or else everyone would have that problem and no one would be having safe sex! I also figured it might be due to the fact that I do masturbate A LOT (I'm talking 2-3 times in a day) so I've decided that while my girlfriend is away for 2 weeks, I will attempt to not masturbate. Now, this will probably prove challenging so I'd like to know if anyone has any real confirmation that it will make a difference. If this is the only factor in both problems then I'm happy to stop, but I need to know because I've attempted it a couple of times before and found it quite difficult.
I hope someone can tell me the answer to my problems, and ease my mind or if there actually is something wrong with me I can go to a doctor and get it sorted out. Thank you for help. :)

We recently got into watching porn together and it's really fun! I enjoy it and I wanna keep doing it, so know by bf have asked to find some porn I wanna watch because he is always the one finding it for us. But I have no idea where to start? I've never watched porn myself, I have no idea who's who and it's just such a big jungle. 

What I'm looking for is basically girl on girl, not to old girls, maybe 20-25 tops, petite bodys and not to big boobs. How will I ever find this without it taking ages? I would mostly prefer to not frequent webpages such as pornhub or something, I want it available on my computer at all times.

My entire family is vegetarian, we do not eat seafood or chicken or any other meats, but we do eat eggs and dairy products. My two siblings and I are not Hindu ourselves, but we have all been raised vegetarian by our father. My parents have always told me that I can eat meat if I like, but I just never have wanted to.

Nobody has ever directly insulted me before in person because I am a vegetarian, but I noticed on the internet that there are many people who openly hate on vegetarians (creating insulting memes, posting mean comments, etc.). This realization that so many people harbor hatred towards vegetarians made me worried that people who I told I was vegetarian were secretly judging me because of that.

Does anyone here understand the reason why so many people seem to hate vegetarians? I know this will be a very tense topic of discussion, but any tactful and understanding responses would really be appreciated.

I was hired to be on this line, which is cool. Well I finished my work and it's the end of day and so I try to leave, but the boss asks me to go around and see if others need help before leaving. Now, in the past the boss has kept everyone late 1-2 hours (without pay) and I'm just not willing to do that. I leave at the end of day assuming I'm done with my work. And it seems my boss is trying to change that so that I have to stay behind like everyone else. Fuck that. First, my opinion is that I was hired to do my job and not the other's job. If I'm going to do another person's job, I expect to be compensated for it. Second, I feel if my reward for working fast and efficient is more work through helping others, it promotes laziness since someone else will come and pick up my slack. It promotes the most advantageous position to be in is the lowest common denominator. And finally, I believe in accountability and responsibility. As workers we are hired to do a specific job. I have no interest in doing that for someone else when they were hired to do it. What should I do? What would you do in this situation?

There's this thing that used to happen to me all the time: Get nervous for no reasons, start sweating a bit. Instead of the sweat doing what it's supposed to and cooling me down, it makes me more hot and nervous. Eventually I just start feeling really hot and uncomfortable and I can feel my heart rate get really high. It just keeps escalating and getting worse.
Slowly I figured out how to get control of it, and it doesn't happen as often, and when it does, it's not as bad as it used to be.
I was wondering if there's a name for this in psychology/medicine because I've never heard anyone else mention it but at the same time I find it really hard to believe that I'm the only one that it (used to) happen to.

1373111059.0	1hqtnu	What if someone had an unknown addiction?	AAAAA42	17	1	8	"Okay, so, for example, let's say a guy named John is asleep.

John's friend Shirley, wanting to play a practical joke, sneaks into his house and, without waking him up, lights a cigarette and puts it in John's mouth.

In his sleep, John smokes the whole cigarette and then Shirley gets rid of the cigarette, leaves John's house and no evidence behind.

So, with no memory of this incident, John develops a nicotine addiction.

What would happen then?

Would he somehow know to get cigarettes to feed it? His brain would probably want more nicotine, but he'd have no way of even knowing what exactly he wanted, right? Would he just go crazy wanting something, but not knowing what? Or what would happen?

Actually, now that I type this out, I imagine he'd go through withdrawal symptoms of nicotine and not know why.

However, I might be wrong and I'm still curious, so..

My daughter is nearing puberty, and has some life-threatening food allergies.  We have already had basic talks about what that means, and sexuality, etc.  But I've been wondering if, for example, a future partner were to eat something that she is allergic to, if she could have an allergic reaction after being exposed to their sex fluids.

My reasoning is this:  when she was a baby and I was nursing her, she would have allergic reactions from my breast milk because small amounts of what moms eat find their way into the milk.  It took us months of doctors visits and trial/error to figure out what was going on, but eventually we found out she has a handful of very severe allergies.

So now I'm wondering if there's a risk of her having a reaction to semen/vaginal fluids (if she swings that way) when she becomes sexually active.  I'd like to cover all bases when it comes time to have a more thorough talk on safe sex."	t5_2w844	True

Does it:

* Increase stamina and/or lower sensitivity

* Increase sensitivity

* Take effect instantaneously or periodically or something  like that

* Sustain the erection after ejaculation

* Have any negative side effects

* Cause the whole ""4-hour-long-erection-thing"" that commonly

* Require you to have a prescription or is it over-the-counter

* Have any real benefits when taken by women

* Have any competition - I think it is Cialis (?) Are they basically the same?

* Act the same universally or do some experience different results than others

I think that's it... I realized that the ads never tell you anything and most of the information I have heard about is from movies, and it is usually comical. Plus none of my friends know anything about it other than it is boner-inducing. Supposedly...

We live together and we are planning on moving about 20 hours away from where we are now. Since we don't know exactly what our living situation will be once we move, we're planning on leaving the dog with his parents until we're settled. 

He never sees her go berserk since it happens while hes at work (5am - 5-7pm) So when I tell him about it he thinks I'm exaggerating. 

I really don't want to bring the dog with us for a number of reasons. We're moving from the desert to a greener state. We pretty much don't have neighbors, so if the dog goes with I'm scared she'll rip the shit out of someone. She HATES people she doesn't know, and she lets them know. Which is great for a guard dog, but not when I can't stop her. 

There's so many things that could go wrong - and in my mind all of them end with us having to put the dog down. 

I feel like I should just wait it out and see how the move goes, then bring up the dog issues, but I'm really unsure of how I should handle this.

Enamel is very thin on both front teeth and uneven on one tooth.

After a night of heavy drinking I seen the next morning an ever so slight chip in my front left tooth, and the enamel is now weaker then ever. I know enamel restoration doesn't exist so I gotta be very careful if I want to keep my enamel, Im only 17.

Okay then, that explained nothing.

I understand it's a ploy to get people to read through the rules (the curiosity of the brick invites them), but it seems like I'm not getting something about the brick itself (including the fact that you finish reading the rules and never find out anything about the brick - the reason you went there to begin with).  It seems to reference the fact that a brick is small, a tablet larger, and reddit's rules are much shorter than other websites... but I don't know, that seems so stupid and out of place I don't get why they would include it.
