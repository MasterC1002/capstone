1371677667.0	1gomce	[PSA] Things to do Daily	alphawavegaming	742	99	304	"*This is a list based off of what I've discovered thus far feel free to remind me of anything I may have missed*

* **Shake all the trees in your town.** *You will usually find ~1k in coins, 0-2 pieces of furniture, and there are five bees in the trees every day. They each sell for 2,500 bells, with the hives selling for 500 bells.*

* **Hit all the rocks in town with your shovel.** *There is a money rock and a gem rock every day. Pro tip: Dig holes all around you before you hit the rock so that you don't slide backwards if it's a money rock*

* **Buy everything in Nookington Junction/any upgraded version.** *The upgrades for the store is based on how much money you spend / items you buy from them. This includes the fortune cookie. Clean those raccoons out!*

* **Dig up anything you see buried.** *You will always find four fossils everyday. Some days you will find 3 Gyroids(crazy wood guys) buried as well, or pitfalls seeds. All of these items are fairly rare(pitfalls are great for annoying neighbours or trolling your friends) and valuable!*
  
      * **Gyroids appear the day after it rained or snowed!**

* **Buy out the flower shop every day.** *Buying 50 saplings will get you a Gold Axe. Buy 50 flowers and you get a silver watering can.*

* **Check Tom Nooks House store.** *There may be a unique house upgrade for the path/fence/roof/housestyle that wasn't there the day before*

* **BUY OUT the Abel Sisters store for new clothing/accessories.** *You never know when your perfect Jack the ripper look can be completed, plus after 10 days, and 10,000 bells Kicks opens up!*

* **Check your beaches for unique items/rare shells.** *Mysterious items and/or persons can wash up on your shores!*

* **Check Retail for turnip prices, new furniture, and special prices.** *If an item is on the chalkboard out front Reese will pay double for it!*

* **Go to the island.** *The silver coin store gets updated daily, as well as new selection of tours every day*

* **Donate new fossils/fish/bugs/sea-creatures to Blathers.** 

   *2nd floor Museum requirements are*:

   * **Donate at least 1 item of each type to the museum**
   * **Be mayor for at least 7 days**
   * **Have at least 30 total items donated**
Blathers will then be awake in the morning one day and will ask you to help him expand the museum.

* **Talk to all of your villagers!** *Often you can get hard to find furniture pieces from interactions with villagers. Try and carry furniture/fish/bugs with you as they will often want to trade or buy what you have*

* **Go swimming in the ocean and find that scallop!** *Pascal is an otter who will ask for the scallop you find. He gives you an item from the sea collection which is hard to find!*

* **Try and build a new public works project every day.** *It may be hard to find the funds, but the bigger and better projects are unlocked later on.*

* **Go into your villagers' house when they're home and look in their closet.** *Sometimes they will give you a random item.*

* **Talk to Sable!** *After a while you'll get her to be friends with you and she'll let you use the QR machine so you can share patterns.*

* **Water all your flowers.** *This may sounds tedious but it builds villager satisfaction, and it regrows the grass beneath them though, as well as making them more likely to hybridize the next day.*

* **Talk to Brewster everyday(The Roost Cafe)**  *If you go and get coffee their everyday for a while, he'll eventually offer you a part time job that pays pretty hefty if you do it right! Plus he gives you a coffee beans that can be put up for 9-10k bells in the flea market and other animals will buy it!*

* **Update your Dream Suite town.**  *You get 5000 bells every time, and it takes about 30 seconds.*

**Super Pro Life Storage Tip:**After you check your mail keep all 10 slots full with open letters. Doesn't matter if they were read ones or you created them by writing letters. That way you can store your equipment (shovel, net, fishing rod, watering can, wetsuit, etc.) in them without taking up inventory space. You can't stuff bugs/fish into letters though.

1373160452.0	1hs2lo	Possible way to get villagers to request Public Works projects!	LavernicaDeLuca	491	67	151	"**EDITED to reflect the findings in the comments. I left the original content but the bad info is struck out.**

Okay so I've tested this method for about a week and I have gotten a request every day so I believe that it works. That, or I just have very weird luck.

~~NOTE: Requires wet suit!~~ **Does NOT require wet suit!**

Here's what you do:

**Step 1:** Empty your pockets of all items and carry minimal money (preferably no money). **NOT required but suggested to avoid villagers asking you to buy their items or trade items**

~~Step 2: Put on your wet suit.~~

~~Step 3: Go swimming for a few minutes and get stung by jellyfish at least once.~~

**Step 2:** Go do something where villagers cannot see you. It can be swimming, fishing at the ocean, placing paths, etc. As long as villagers do not see you for around 5 minutes, you're good. You MUST be outside and in town. If you go inside or to Main Street, you will reset the clock.

**Step 3:** ~~Get out of the water and~~ Go walk around town in front of all your villagers that are outside. At least one should get the ""BING"" sound and lines above their head (sorry not sure what that's called). Go talk to that person. They will either ask you to do a favor, ask for a catchphrase/greeting, give you a random item (cool beans), ask a random question, or **request a Public Works project!**

If you get a public works request, congrats! Feel free to keep trying for more requests but the consensus seems to be that you can only get one. If you don't get a request, try it all over again. You should get one within 5 tries. Keep in mind that if you've already had a request that day, you will probably not be able to get another one.

I read about this method on a forum (can't remember which one) and I thought it was BS but I was shocked to see that it actually worked for me. Some days I get the request first try but other times it takes 4-5 times. But the end result is the same, I get a Public Works request!

**If you are not getting any bings after a few tries, go talk to a villager to see if they tell you to ""take a break."" If they do, I would suggest that you ""save and quit,"" reload the game, and try again.**"	t5_2ro2c	True

1374510329.0	1itj5r	New Leaf Improvement Suggestions	UtterEast	388	43	318	"Inspired by [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1is2xe/disappointments_in_new_leaf/). It's wishful thinking to expect Nintendo to actually patch some of this stuff, but I thought it would be cool if we could get an improvements/suggestions jam going. Here's some improvements I think/wish could be made:

* **Nintendo items**: you should be able to trade in winning tickets for a random piece of regular furniture if you want. I have like 4 Super Stars and Midna's Masks.

* **Fruit AUTO-STACK**, Bell bags automatically go into your ""wallet"" if it's not full

* **Balloon items**: using different slingshots changes the possible content of the presents. Normal/other tool-- balloon furniture items; Silver-- random furniture; Gold-- random furniture plus random spotlight items

* **Villagers moving in**: when a new villager arrives, Isabelle tells you to meet them at the train station. You walk around with the villager (plus Isabelle/Tom Nook?) and help them choose a plot for their house. No more destruction of your stuff. Villagers might express a preference for their house location (e.g. near stores, near ponds, near the beach) to make it feel less like you're railroading them.

* Beautiful town ordinance should make **grass** only deteriorate if you run/Grass should just straight up not deteriorate unless you run. I *never* run in my town and it's going to look like Fallout 3 by winter.

* **More ordinances**: maybe a pair of ordinances that remove the bottom 10% most common fish/bugs, but penalize you by removing the top 10% most rare bugs/fish. Might be handy if you're gunning for a certain rare fish/bug and are tired of sea bass and horned dynastids. Maybe a northern/southern town ordinance that lets you plant pine trees in the south of your town/plant palm trees in the south of your town (not just the beach). Maybe an ordinance that gives you southern hemisphere weather (!) (pretty complicated).

* **Multiple ordinances** active: at a certain level of town development, you should be able to activate more than one ordinance at a time.

* **More weather + effects**: One thing I miss from WW was that sometimes it would be foggy/misty really early in the morning. I'd like to see more types of weather like fog, wind, rushing clouds, etc. and more environmental/villager effects due to weather-- I'd like to see flowers/trees dripping water in the rain and the water on the beach getting more rough. When it's thunderstorming out, I'd like to see my villagers all head indoors and lights come on. Only I am (or at least not ALL of my villagers are) crazy enough to walk around in a lightning storm carrying a pointed metal object above my head.

* **More villagers out**, fewer in strange places on Main Street where I can't always find them. I think this was limited in WW because too many characters onscreen made the game lag, but the hardware must have improved by now.

* Let the **megaphone** work in multiplayer.

* Wearing **swimming items** (e.g. snorkel mask, goggles, add a flippers item) increases your speed and time underwater when diving.

* Activate a **placement ""advanced mode""**: Use the touch screen and a grid format to place new buildings, public works, etc. and to place furniture in your house. Currently the trial and error mode is such a timewaster.

* (Probably an idea for the next game) **Different biome towns**: be able to pick different biomes/climates for your town, like a more northern colder town, southern warmer town, levels of dryness/wetness, etc.

* **Mayor-created holidays**: the villagers remark that you should make up holidays when there isn't an in-game one coming up. This is just empty conversation, but why not for real? It would have to be from a template: you could pick a date and time and then pick the type of celebration (fireworks, lights, etc.), pick an item for Isabelle to hand out (ice cream, tweeter, balloon, etc.), pick a special visitor to invite who might also give out an item etc.

So i created a flat web page (no images, no javascript, no nothing) to quickly upload my screenshots to.

Here's how you use it:

* take screenshot using L+R 
* press Home button
* launch web browser (your game is still running, don't worry!)
* point it to the very easily typed URL [loik.li](http://www.loik.li)
* tap the button to choose a screenshot to upload
* 2 QR codes are generated

The 1st QR code is a link to the image file.  
Use this to upload to imgur ""from Web"".

The 2nd QR code will cause your phone browser to save the image file directly.  (usually into your phone's ""Downloads"" directory)  
This is for your own use to share on facebook, twitter, whatsapp, or whatever else you have on your phone.

Otherwise, you should be able to type out the simple URL on your PC browser to save it.

1373169744.0	1hsbbn	I think New Leaf does a really good job transforming Nook into a likable character.	puddingbear	272	39	63	"I feel like Nintendo really put a lot of thought into Nook's likability with this game. I remember someone on here saying that he was never intended to be seen as ""robber baron"" sort of character in the first place... IMO, he just ended up coming off that way because of his function in the previous games (being the center of the economy--you earn bells by selling things to him and then you turn around and give them back to him for goods/loans).

I think taking him out of the role of the shopkeeper was a really good move. He's no longer the center of the economy; you earn your bells from Reese, but you don't just turn around and spend them back with Reese like you would have with done Tom Nook in previous games. If you do spend money at Re-Tail, the money either goes to the villagers who are selling second-hand, or it is a very small amount to Cyrus for refurbishing. All other spending is spread out across other shops.

So now Tom Nook is solely in charge of homes, and he doesn't immediately push the next expansion on you like he did in previous games. You get to choose when you want to expand again, so it doesn't seem like he's so eager for your money.

Finally, there's more of a peek into his backstory now that you can occasionally unlock chit-chat between him and Lyle (so far I've gotten to hear about his visits to the Able Sisters, and him being a bit of a softy with Timmy &amp; Tommy), and because you can see him in the cafe.

TLDR: I'm glad that I can love Tom Nook now, instead of resenting him for taking all my money. Also, he's just so cute in his little sweater.

edit: Another thought, I also like Lyle a lot more now too, now that he's not a shady insurance guy or someone who hates his job."	t5_2ro2c	True

1371479825.0	1gimlg	Grass wear &amp; path making in New Leaf	falterer	247	25	128	"Having only played _Wild World_ before, I spent my first few days running around my _NL_ town in ignorance until I noticed it'd slowly been turning to mud. Gaa! Grass deteriorates!

[Someone wrote a very in-depth guide about _City Folk_ grass deterioration](http://www.animalcrossingcommunity.com/Topic/3343548/1/), but information about _New Leaf_ is spotty and contradictory. Here I've collected what seem to be the most widely corroborated factoids about _New Leaf's_ grass wear:

**Things that seem to be true / are broadly corroborated:**

* Sprinting (holding down ""B"" while moving) wears grass down faster than walking over it, especially if you skid (by changing direction quickly).
* Rain and snow promote grass growth.
* [Fertilizer does not promote grass growth.](http://www.animalcrossingcommunity.com/Topic/5784242/1/#MessageID65189532) Fertilizer [is used to improve the chances of flowers breeding and of trees producing ""delicious"" fruit](http://www.animalcrossingcommunity.com/Topic/5709123/1/Usage_of_Fertilizer).
* [Pattern tiles can be laid down to make paths](http://www.thonky.com/animal-crossing-new-leaf/grass-wear/), which can guide you while running around town and reduce the spread of grass wear. [Here are some great QR codes](http://bidoofcrossing.tumblr.com/tagged/p) for path patterns.

**Things that are said to be true:**

* [Walking quickly does not wear down grass](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gimlg/grass_wear_path_making_in_new_leaf/caksl0m); only sprinting by holding down ""B"" has a noticeable effect.
* Planting flowers over mud patches and then watering them daily with the watering can is said to promote grass growth. [Someone raised a good question about this yesterday.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gfw38/questions_about_grass_wear/cajuqdf) I'm going to experiment by planting some flowers in the middle of a large mud spot and leaving the rest bare.
* [Watering grass with the watering can is said not to promote grass growth.](http://bidoofcrossing.tumblr.com/post/41357009523/animal-crossing-new-leaf-grass-wear) Apparently flowers must be growing on the spot.
* Some have said trees do not promote grass growth. [RainbowStuff reports otherwise.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gimlg/grass_wear_path_making_in_new_leaf/cakkxny)
* [Habitual runners have reported success laying down rows of patterns as guides until natural paths develop underneath them.](http://www.animalcrossingcommunity.com/Topic/5759871/1/#MessageID64983691) Others have said this doesn't work and that patterns prevent wear (see Updates 1 &amp; 2 below).

Please comment if you have any corrections / corroboration to contribute! Screenshots and sources are very much appreciated; it seems a lot of the information out there's based on hearsay.

---

**Updates**

1. [RainbowStuff reports](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gimlg/grass_wear_path_making_in_new_leaf/cakkxny) that grass stays green or brown beneath patterns, so it's certainly worth running some experiments before going to the trouble of laying patterns everywhere!
2. [supadoodles and nautiless also report](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gimlg/grass_wear_path_making_in_new_leaf/cakm0r6) that patterns prevent grass deterioration. I'm moving that item to the ""hearsay"" section.
3. [super helpful comment from MokshaMilkshake](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gimlg/grass_wear_path_making_in_new_leaf/caksl0m) with some additional details.
4. [I've started some experiments!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gimlg/grass_wear_path_making_in_new_leaf/cakz93y)
5. In case you missed it, [someone wrote a lovely post about why the game punishes us for running](http://bradofarrell.tumblr.com/post/53240062537/oh-man-all-these-people-are-playing-animal)."	t5_2ro2c	True

Edit: To answer the question of ""Who is Katie?"":  

Paraphrased from the Prima Guide:

Katie is a rare visitor, but the more you travel to other towns, or invite people to yours, the more likely she will show up! Katie loves to travel, but is afraid to go alone. Take her to another town from the train station. Katie appreciates your efforts and will reward you with a gift!"	t5_2ro2c	True

So about 5 weeks back I imported a Japanese copy of New Leaf. I played it up until the US version came out when I started fresh there. Haven't really touched my other copy since, so I had a thought for an experiment. 

Would the /r/animalcrossing community be up for trying something a little different. I would leave my town gates open 10+ hours a day and let you, the community, govern it.  

I would still start public works and such, but everything else would be up to all of you. Take foreign fruit, bury yours, leave an item at re-tail, take fossils, conversate with the locals, sell turnips. Whatever yall want. 

I'd love to see if the community continues to grow the town, or if I pick it up one day and have no trees and 300 pitfalls. 

Let me know what yall think of it!

Edit:FC: 4613-6989-4407

 Wow, so I'm absolutely blown away by the support behind this idea. It took me longer than expected to get things set up in even the most basic way. I just finished registering 80something friend codes! That took over an hour. I was expecting 10 or maybe 15 at the most. I'm east coast time, so its past midnight as I post this update. Im opening my town overnight and I'll check it in the morning. I registered people in the order that they sent their fc, so if you didn't make the cut, sorry :/ I might clean up my list tomorrow to make room for a few more, but for the most part I'm right at 100. In the morning I'll try to start a community project before I head to work, but no guarantees! Once again, thank you everyone for being so supportive of this idea. Here...We...Go!"	t5_2ro2c	True

Well, that's not fair. One was terrible and the other was really coy and kept to himself. That is, until he was antagonized enough. He'd turn into this raging sonofabitch and break shit whilst screaming his 5 year old head off. Kid wanted to be left alone but his older brother couldn't deal with that. After dealing with this every weekend, I told the parents I didn't want to deal with it anymore. They doubled my pay and I talked them into letting me bring over video games to help babysit. They asked me which game and to show them first (they didn't allow their kids to play video games). I decided to bring over animal crossing, seemed harmless enough. The parents agreed and let me bring over that one game to keep their kids entertained. The youngest wasn't too interested, he likes to be left to his own devices but the oldest loved himself some Animal Crossing. He sat and played for the entire time, harvesting apples, fishing, and catching bugs without tormenting his brother, it was great. I left the older brother a strategy guide and memory card and told him ""I'll bring it back next weekend as long as you don't pick on your little brother"". And he didn't, parent's said he was great. After a couple of weekends of this, I just ended up leaving my gamecube over at their place, he could only play a couple of hours on there anyway.  Apparently having this outlet really helped the kid and the family. 

Last year I went back home for xmas and attended a party at the house I used to babysit in. Turns out the older brother planted an apple tree in their backyard, because of animal crossing. It's survived the winters and should be giving fruit pretty soon. Both of the bros are pretty decent kids in college now. Little one is doing some type of engineering and the oldest one is doing CS with a focus in graphics. I think he wants to work on games, didn't get to talk to him too much. Anyway, seems like Animal Crossing was a pretty big turning point for that family.


TL;DR

**Older brother picks on younger brother a lot. I give the Older brother animal crossing and he becomes less violent and generally a better person. Grows an apple tree.** "	t5_2ro2c	True

Avoid using your address or anything too personal, but you want to be sure if it's lost a good samaritan CAN find a way to return it. Alternately, if you have a label/sticker maker you could physically place information on the back of your system.

Eleven of these items are fairly easy to get -- everything but the Giant Snakehead, really -- so that's over 85,000 HHA points just for some collecting.  By plopping these things around in your already-pretty-cool house, you should be able to top 150k and get your top award!  You're then freed to decorate as you see fit without worrying about HHA point values!

The items are:

* Brown Cicada
* Robust Cicada
* Giant Cicada
* Walker Cicada
* Evening Cicada
* Cicada Shell
* Giant Snakehead
* Sweetfish
* Napoleonfish
* Sparkler (yes, just drop the bag anywhere in the room)
* Roman Candle
* Fountain Firework

edit: Note that adding more than one of an individual item doesn't give you extra points.  You only get points for one of each of these.

1375582430.0	1jnqm4	My parents have been playing Animal Crossing in some form almost daily since the gamecube version. They've completed every museum, every house expansion.	Darling_Shivar	202	23	27	"I got New Leaf for my birthday, on release.

They don't have a 3DS to share. 

Earlier we were talking about the 3DS game as they were playing City Folk. She looked through my guide for the game and was in awe, and got upset that she'd never play it.

Today, for their anniversary, my dad got my mom a used 3DS a friend of mine had never used ever, for a really, really good price, and I bought them a point card to get New Leaf. It is downloading on the newly set up 3DS. He's going to give it to her tomorrow, early (anniversary isn't for another two weeks).

And I'm really really excited. I'm gonna have fun helping her start out and see all the new stuff and develop her town. I can't wait for her to visit my town and meet all my villagers. She's going to be so excited. I'm trying to think of presents to buy to give her for her first day, but I don't really have anything cataloged that I know she'd like. I'll give her a bunch of shoes, she's so upset that Kicks in City Folk can only randomly give you new colored shoes. (Edit: I got and wrapped some Mary Janes, Purple Pumps, Purple Glasses, and Huge Shades!)

I just wanted to tell somebody, I guess.

Curiosity struck me and I remembered that Kappa's in Japanese folklore sometimes would kidnap and drown children.

Maybe, though this is nothing more than a crazy game theory, your character was drowned by a ""kappa"" (Kap'n bringing you through the rain) and the village you arrive in is the afterlife. The letters from your mother would be her grieving and the occasional money would be gifts laid at your grave.
