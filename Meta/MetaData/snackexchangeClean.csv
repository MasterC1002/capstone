1360700508.0	18eam1	Snack Exchange saves a life	Housewife26	515	46	49	"This doesn't include an actual snack exchange, but you'll appreciate this story--hear me out.

Last week, I was lovingly putting together an American package of goodies to send to /u/astrakan. I had the time a few days ago to drop the package at the post office. I planned on parking in front of the building, but of course someone had parked taking up two spaces--leaving no room for me. 
A detour commenced, taking me around the block and forcing me to drive down an alley that rarely gets any traffic. In the corner of my eye I saw a woman on the ground. Upon a double take, I realized that she was trying to get up but kept falling back to the ground. I have never gotten out of my car faster. She was bleeding profusely. Gushing. So much blood. I got the attention of a gentleman nearby, thankfully he had paper towels in his truck and we were able to cover her gash as I called for an ambulance. She was responsive, quietly insisting that she was fine and she only had a bloody nose (the chunk of flesh on the ground next to her begged to differ). We learned her name and her age (80) and tried to keep her talking, even if she gave one word answers. 
The medics arrived and thanked me for calling and keeping her conscious. I silently thanked Snack Exchange for putting me in the right place at the right time.

2. I'm 2/2 with /r/snackexchange and it has been an infinitely more awesome and delicious experience.

3. I sent my last secret santa 40€ worth of French snacks that cost me quite a pretty sum to ship to Canada. Guy never responded to let me know he received the package. One month later, after my third message to him, he finally sent me a curt reply simply letting me know that the package was received, but did not even say thanks or anything. I guess his parents never introduced to him the awesome energy source that is snacks!

This sub is great, not just for its snacks but for the enthusiastic appreciation everyone always shows each other. Who needs secret santa."	t5_2rqyn	True

1303684139.0	gwk38	IAmA: Real life customs officer. A simple set of requests before the trading frenzy.	CustomsCartman	152	25	52	"Greetings,

I rarely talk about work but seeing as hundreds of you are about to ship food internationally I figured I'd drop in using this one off and make a simple list of requests to try to prevent someone's act of kindness from becoming a biological disaster of epic proportions.

I know there are a lot of people around here that are suspicious and/or dismissive of pretty much all forms of government regulation on their personal actions. However, agricultural and biological import/export rules are almost without exception driven by very real threats to the local ecology of each state that sets them. Global trade is introducing invasive species at a breathtaking pace all around the world and it only takes one seed or egg bearing female to produce horrific die offs in the wild or billions of dollars of damage to local agriculture. So if you don't give a fuck about any other law you encounter on a daily basis I'm asking you to please heed to prohibitions on food to the country you are sending to.  

First the good news candy, sweets, confectionery etc is allowable pretty much everywhere. Commercially baked goods that have a shelf life longer than most teenage relationships are also good to go. 

The moderators have a decent list in their FAQ on what to send/not send and it really is a great idea to check with your the relevant websites of the country you are sending to or your post office if they have that kind of info. But here are a few things that are banned  pretty much everywhere. (Note: Intra EU shipments are pretty much fair game from what I can tell. )

Fresh fruit, home dried fruit, home canned fruit, home pickled fruit. 

Any kind of processed stone fruit (think peaches) that still have the pit inside of them. 

Fresh leaves or bark. 

Meat, the regs vary country to country but most countries are extremely restrictive on imports of meat. From experience most people grasp why fruit is a problem a lot quicker than meat but even processed meat can carry a variety of agricultural threats, especially when not processed properly. This includes dried, smoked, or pickled meats. Fish is ok in some places, but not in others (Australia bans most fish for example). Some states are more permissive than others so check before sending. Send absolutely nothing you killed and prepared yourself (and yes that includes jerky.)

Seeds and nuts that aren't commercially roasted. Don't be a dick on this one. It takes one under cooked or uncooked seed to start an invasion.

Live birds or birds nests (yes people eat both), any kind of feathers or other random bits that are pulls off live birds. 

Home cooked eggs and baked good that contain whole eggs within (aka mooncakes). 

I know a lot of you just read the list and thought ""WHY THE FUCK WOULD I SEND THAT???"" but if this job has taught me anything it's almost anything digestible is considered a snack SOMEWHERE in the world. 

Now a word on packing,

If you reuse an old box for international shipments please make ABSOLUTELY SURE the box is clean, and has no random dirt/dried leaves/seeds stuck to it anywhere. 

Don't use straw, wood shavings, or other natural fibers used as batting in the packages.

Also no burlap bags, especially old burlap. You'd be amazed at what kind of insects and mites can live on that stuff. 

No solid wood packing of pretty much any kind. To include wooden internal supports in boxes or external wooden frames (I can't imagine anyone is going to send enough this would be necessary but I'm throwing it in there just in case. 

Finally if you aren't sure make sure to declare the food. The most that will happen is the offending items will be removed and the package will be sent on its way. If you fail to declare and the items get intercepted the wait time for the box is usually much longer and in some countries they just destroy the whole damn thing. 

Ok, that's about it, feel to mock me about kinder eggs (no clue) or how your cousin once brought in a half gram of marijuana through an airport stuffed in the lining of his ear canal. 

Edited to reiterate that this isn't an all inclusive list. Australia and New Zealand are a lot more restrictive than say China for example. If you have any questions check with the local countries web sites most are easy to find.

* Some people like Philip1209 have offered to act as intermediaries, this might be a good idea if you're looking to save on shipping although it will depend on how many orders there are of course, I'll leave those details up to you guys.

* **Official [video](http://www.nerune.jp/popin/howto/osushi.html)  **complete with cheesy 50's jingle muzak. I'm not sure how many pieces you can make with each box but it looks like 5-6.

* I was bored, have a [popin' cook](http://i.imgur.com/pzlNB.jpg).

* They also make other [crazy stuff](http://www.nerune.jp/popin/).

TOMHORSERY! 

No but seriously, [**the first formal mass exchange has just been announced by the fine chaps at /r/secretsanta and redditgifts.com.**](http://redditgifts.com/exchanges/snacks/)

Registration for this is open as of now, I'm going to be promoting it around the food subreddit circuit and the international subreddits, and I could use all the help I can get with that. MO' PEOPLE MO' TRADES, as they say in Detroit. They don't fucking say that in Detroit, Happybadger. You fucking LIE. 

No but seriously, I went to Detroit like twice. I've seen some shit, man. I've seen shit you don't want to see. The first time I went to a really shitty rave and they had this sound system that was *hooked up to a car* because apparently nobody in Detroit has actual hookups beyond a guy with a car and they thought to themselves ""Well *there's* an idea"" and then topped off the night by giving everyone E that was more speed than MDMA and it was fucking horrid so we left within a few hours AND THEN the next time it was to meet up with my girlfriend at the time for this party in Ontario but I couldn't get across the border because I looked like an illegal immigrant which I technically kind of am but her family came to pick me up and there was automatic gunfire and hookers and homeless people and I fucked up my first impression and she ended up betraying me a few hours later which hasn't quite resolved itself but god is she ever a terrible person, truly bleeding vile. 

*BIG ASS SNACK EXCHANGE:*

- Normal trades will be going on simultaneously as normal. The mass exchange is **OFF-SITE** at [**redditgifts.com**](http://redditgifts.com/exchanges/snacks/). If it's anything like Secret Santa/mixcd, you won't get to choose who you receive from or who you send to, but presumably they're going to try to make it as international as possible.

- If you're one of those vegan chaps with the vegetables and the bitching and the hating AMERICAN VALUES, get the fuck off my subreddit. Do it. Go. Now. Nobody wants you. I want you. Come back baby. I need you. I love you. I bought you that thing you wanted. Mark somewhere in your comments that you're a communist so your sender knows to not include steak and human food. This is all comment-stalking based, and if you're a lurker you're fucking yourself over.

- /r/badkarma won't be the place to deal with bad trades. A few of you will get *jipped* (which is now offensive to the Roma, but you won't speak up). It happens with every trade. There will presumably be make-up trades. 

- Homemade is a-okay, I'd avoid sending any magic snacks unless you've got an ent sendee and it's clearly marked in some way so they don't have a bad trip. Don't be a harshmellow, be a marshmallow.

- If you send pure drugs or prostitutes, figgi94@gmail.com is my personal email address. I get first taste. ALWAYS. Don't fuck wit' me Christophah, yous a good kid but yous always gotta fuck wit' me doncha. 

- Vanilla coke is *so fucking good*. 

- Suggested trade cost, *before shipping*, is $15. Altogether this will run you about $30-50, maybe. That's prohibitively expensive for some and you *may* be able to find someone willing to courier it in /r/favors. Domestic shipping is almost always pretty damn cheap and you could shave $10-20 off the final price doing that.

- Please post pictures of your hoard on the redditgifts.com website when you receive it. That's kind of a tradition here because everyone loves snacks. 

- Please direct questions about this to /r/secretsanta or through the redditgifts.com website. This may be based around /r/snackexchange but it's as new to me as it is to you. 

- Signups will probably close fairly quickly. Don't lollygag you lollygagging son of a lollygagger. 

- Bullet point.

We killed a lot of people to get to where we are now. I shipped a lot of bad jerky to a lot of innocent kids, and I will have to live with that. You though, you're still pure. Get out there and trade.

1358879772.0	172gye	New users? Get a verified sender AK-47 from other sources! / Own a snack business? Advertise on the sidebar for a coupon code!	happybadger	107	16	18	"We just got like four thousand new subscribers from the askreddit thread, so let's go over a few things. 

The AK-47 next to a user's name means they have sent a package in the past. There aren't tiered weapons yet, but in the future we may expand it to show multiple trades. For now you can search a username on the sidebar and see what trades they've participated in. 

If you haven't traded in snackexchange before, you can still get an AK-47! Trades in **/r/mysterybox, /r/teaexchange, or the Reddit Gifts Snack Exchange 1** all count toward an AK-47. If you have traded in other subreddits/RG exchanges, you won't get an AK-47 but it really helps to mention that in your post. 

**BE CAREFUL TRADING WITH UNVERIFIED AND NEW SENDERS**. The vast majority of our scams have been from new accounts. To see the account age, click the username. You trade at your own risk and we have no tools to prevent someone from being a dick. [**HERE IS THE GUIDE TO SUCCESSFUL EXCHANGES**](http://www.reddit.com/r/snackexchange/comments/q73dc/the_guide_to_successful_trading/). 


----

If you own a snack-related business and would like to advertise with us, we do offer a programme detailed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snackexchange/comments/l6gcm/monetised_links_and_you_a_chinamans_guide_to_not/). In exchange for a coupon code, you can create a post in the subreddit and have your business linked on the sidebar for the duration of the promotion. All other advertisements will be treated as spam and you will be banned without warning. Alternatively, reddit offers a paid platform which apparently has great results. [Here are the details on that](http://www.reddit.com/ad_inq/).

Mine package came back. Disappointed, I checked and got a revised address and resent it. 

Unfortunately it came back again. This time with rejected stamps all over it. The contents inside were crushed, despite careful packing, and I had to bin the whole lot. 

I am really sorry, Damien_X. I am happy to reimburse you, but I am not going to try and send another package. It cost me $55 to send the original package from Australia, I just can't risk it. 

And I'm really sorry to the community, I was looking forward to doing more exchanges. 

Good luck in all your exchanges.

Mods don't have tools to verify people except for the flair system, and we only use that after someone has traded. There seems to have been an upswing in scams lately, and I think it's time we go over basic safety tips once more:

1. You're giving a box of sweets to someone on the street and asking them to post you one when they get home. Who is more likely to respond, a person passing through your city or a long-time resident who you see daily? **CHECK USERPAGES BEFORE YOU TRADE.** Throwaway accounts, trolls, lurkers, these are people who have nothing to lose by scamming you. 

2. ***CHECK USERPAGES BEFORE YOU TRADE.***

3.  Set a mutual send-off date and request/offer proof of posting. 

4. Don't be afraid to ask that an unverified member send first, then send upon proof of posting. 

By being assertive, you can protect yourself. The only way we can protect you is to go off-site, and that's its own can of worms that I'm not keen on opening.

1309977001.0	iibeo	A small, temporary proposal.	happybadger	93	17	61	"[This is the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/snackexchange/comments/ii418/it_seems_like_weve_been_having_problems_with/) where I'd like to keep the debate on the issue centred, but scams have been an ongoing problem since our inception and there has never been an easy solution on my end for vetting users. Shit sucks.

What I'm proposing is a simple rule. Before any trade is sent off, users must first send each other a picture of their snack box with the lid open to show the snacks. The logic behind this:

1. Unless you're trading with someone from Darfur, which I wouldn't recommend because nobody likes a box full of grubs and abject poverty, we all have access to some form of camera. This is 2011, you can afford to blow $30 on snacks, and you don't live in a rural African village where Sesame Street is E for ebola and big bird is vomiting blood on live television. 

2. You can't just tape a box shut and take a picture of it. It has to show the snacks. If someone is spending $20 on specific snacks, they're probably going to send it. 

3. Both users get a picture. Both users know that the other person is actually interested in the exchange. Friendship.

This would be linked on the top and on the sidebar. Both users would have one week from agreeing to the exchange to post a picture to each other, and if one backs out *without good reason* after the other buys then I'll ban them. Awesome.

1364135394.0	1awwuj	SnackExchange, I think I've been conned! Is there anything I can do about a deadbeat Redditor??	BakerofHumanPies	87	12	57	"Hi everyone! About two months ago I was browsing through r/SnackExchange and saw someone offering to mail Cadbury creme eggs anywhere in the world in exchange for yummy treats. I live in a far off corner of the world in Asia and sadly can't get those delicious sugar bombs here. I replied to the original poster, and we agreed to an exchange - I would send treats from my corner of the world and she would send me some creme eggs in return. I followed through on my end of the bargain and sent some Asian snack goodies within a week, along with a message letting her know I've done so and a photo of the package being mailed. She never replied... It's been more close to two months now and I'm pretty sure I spent time and money on a Redditor who essentially conned me into mailing her food.


The Redditor in question still logs onto Reddit quite frequently to post things, but hasn't responded to my messages asking about the status of my creme eggs. Since it's been close to two months since we agreed on the exchange, I'm reasonably sure they aren't on the way, especially since the Redditor in question won't answer my messages.

1316599740.0	kmlfi	Protip: If you live in the US, read this. 	happybadger	76	7	41	"Whenever someone makes a generalisation about the US on this website, there is always a pack of American redditors jumping on them to remind them that there is no such thing as an ""American"", as every state may as well be its own country. 

There is merit to this, especially concerning food. Every state has its own special cuisine and take on general American foods. Vermont has its syrups and maple sweets, Indiana has its corn, Texas has its sauces, California has its almonds and Mexican-fusion, and so on and so forth. 

Now if you're trying to trade abroad, you can't assume that someone in Berlin knows where Kentucky is and what you have there. The only real exposure foreign countries have to American snacks is through limited displays at groceries and grossly overpriced import stores, and at that it's generic, nationally-available snacks which are typically shit. 

When making a post trading abroad, mention which state you're from and name some snacks which set it apart from the dozens of other American posters this week. I've seen a lot of you post three or four times without anyone biting and it's because you say ""I'm from the US. We have twinkies."" rather than ""I'm from Wisconsin. We have some of the greatest microbrew beers on the planet, lots of jerked meats and cheese products, and cinnamon apple jam that is to die for.""

Plus, if nothing else, it's so much more interesting to see local snacks than it is to see Reese's Cups and Little Debbie Filth Bars.

Is it against any rules that I don't see (I'm only mobile currently and for the foreseeable future) that would restrict a Skype shopping trip?

I'm talking about exchanging Skype details, make the video call, and have you grocery shop with me. If you see something that sparks your interest, I'll ship it to you. And maybe if all goes well, you'd return the favor. 

Has this been done before? Is this poor form Peter? Am I breaking some subreddit rule? (sorry mods if I am)

While the first is nice and all, let's talk about the second. Don't send cannabis to people through the post, especially if you don't know how to do it. We have always and will always ban posts sending drugs as we find them, as per implied site rules and bullshit US law, and if you're not intelligent enough to circumvent that then the only person I feel bad for is your recipient who is out a box of snacks.

1347186361.0	zlijv	Disillusioned	tasharanee	68	9	56	"This is not a pity post to ask for snacks.  It's just to say that I have become disillusioned with r/snackexchange of late.  I'm not asking for snacks, so please don't write to say that you feel my pain, and will send me stuff.  I really don't want that.  I work on a US base in the UK.  This allows me access to both US and UK snacks, and I have had some fun providing both to people.

Lots of times, I've given people things they requested, and asked nothing in exchange.  Having lived in a few countries, I know that it's a pain not to be able to get something that you want, and initially, I got a kick out of being able to help.  Most everyone has been great, and though the cashiers look at me funny when I buy trolleys full of jammie dodgers and jaffa cakes, I've had a blast.

My last two exchanges went a little sour.  One person asked for conditioner only available in the UK, so I sent it.  She insists that she sent my box in exchange, but I really don't believe it.  It's been a very long time, and mail between our two countries does not take that long.  Another person asked for kool-aid.  I got one of every flavor our commissary sells, and sent them posthaste.  When asked what I'd like in exchange, I told him.  I received nothing, not even replies to my inquiries.  Again, he's in the UK, too, so mail does not take weeks and weeks.

It just seems to me that a few people have ruined it for me.  If you're going to be part of r/snack exchange, be a good ambassador.  Send the snacks you say you'll send, and keep your mailing receipts.  No one should send a package in good faith, and not receive one in return.  Things do go wonky with the mail from time to time, but not keeping communication open is kind of suspicious.  That's it, I guess.  Thanks for reading my rant.

Here's the [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/snackexchange/comments/u1d1l/irl_looking_to_trade_for_some_japanese_treats/) he posted. Anyway, I [delivered](http://www.reddit.com/r/snackexchange/comments/uyfoz/sorry_for_the_delay_but_give_mmutinoi_her_ak/), and he still hasn't. I have no issue with waiting, but when you start to [ignore me](http://i.imgur.com/o7rVW.jpg), then we have a problem. It's such a shitty feeling to go out of your way for someone with no reciprocation. I didn't send him much, but shipping alone cost $25. For a student, it hurt to have to spend so much just for shipping costs. I was really excited to get some candies in return... But I got nothing instead.

Anyway, I'm not here to call anyone names or to make him feel guilty. No, I'm just posting this to warn future traders about this guy. 

Thanks for reading.

EDIT: Wow, I really exaggerated how much I spent on shipping. It was $25, not $40. But it still sucked nonetheless.

**Making a post:**

- The most important thing to consider in your title is your location. Not only do shipping costs vary wildly between countries, but potential exchangees may be enticed by the prospect of trading with someone from Canada when they otherwise wouldn't want to do this. 

- Context is another good thing to include. What you're trading, how much of it you want, that sort of thing. 

- Here is an example title and subtext from my perspective: [Title: (FRA) Trading culinary lavender, wanting local berbere mixes!] [Subtext box: I can also get more or less anything from Lyon or Paris, but will also be travelling through the southern portion of the country and can pick up whatever you fancy.]

**Setting up the trade:**

- If someone messages you or comments, check their profile before going any further. Generally people aren't out to scam you, but around 5% of the trades in /r/snackexchange fall through for one reason or another and **almost every single one of those is at the fault of someone with less than 6 months and 10.000 combined karma** (NOTE: Don't use that as law. Be weary of throwaway accounts and big lurkers, but use account activity and gut feeling as your guide rather than arbitrary numbers). You are trading at your own peril here, as the mods don't have the tools to help you if it goes south. Avoid trading with new accounts or very inactive accounts as a rule of thumb.

- Again, **CHECK USERPAGES BEFORE ACCEPTING A TRADE**. This cannot be overstated enough. There is absolutely no protection available to you, legal or otherwise. If you trade with someone who has no reputation to lose, you're giving a stranger off the street $50 in sweets and telling them to give you $50 in sweets the next day. 

- Don't be pushy or rude. Propriety goes a long way. 

- Don't demand real-world identities. Some of us are totally okay with linking our usernames to our real names, but others are apprehensive. If that person gives you a username instead of their real name, don't take it as a sign that they're not taking this seriously. My Secret Santa packages come from Bursuc Fericit, very obviously not my name (""Happy Badger"" in Romanian), and have never been returned to me or rejected by customs. Just write ""Reddit"" as their surname. 

- It's a good idea to exchange pictures of the postmarked boxes before sending them off just so you know that your exchangee is serious about it. Obviously the contents are another story, but if you are scammed at least you wasted both their time and a perfectly good box. 

- **Make note of anything you cannot receive and why.** This cannot be stressed enough. If your immune system hates you or there are cultural, religious, or personal reasons why you cannot have something, it's your responsibility to speak up for yourself. 

**Readying your package:**

- First, make sure that you can actually send the things you're wanting to send. [**Here is an AMA from a customs agent detailing some of the things that can't be sent.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/snackexchange/comments/gwk38/iama_real_life_customs_officer_a_simple_set_of/) Every country has its own restrictions, and it's your responsibility to make sure that your package's contents don't go against them. It's also worth checking your exchangee's profile to see if there are any clues as to things which they definitely wouldn't like, even if they've not mentioned it. **FAILURE TO ABIDE BY CUSTOMS RULES MAY RESULT IN YOUR PACKAGE BEING CONFISCATED.**

- Please don't include illegal drugs. To save my own arse I have to ban any users which send illegal drugs. If you decide to ignore this warning, at least look up a guide first so you don't end up in a cell. It's also worth noting that not everyone is an ent and not every ent is in an ent-friendly environment, so it's just generally a bad idea which could get all of us in trouble. THC oil falls under this. 

- Package everything securely. All couriers are bad. All couriers will beat your package like an Irishman's wife. Wrap things in a way that ensures they won't break. It's also a bad idea to include things which may break, like glass or flimsy wood, as they'll probably break. 

- Fill out all customs forms as accurately as possible. **This is very, very important.** Customs will tear apart your package if it doesn't comply with their rules. Print neatly, list the contents accurately, and don't give them any reason to open your package. 

- Be mindful of couriers. Some couriers won't carry alcohol, some charge an absurd amount of money, some (namely Pochta Rossi and other Eastern European/Southeastern Asian) couriers are notorious for stealing packages. Knowing when to use a state courier (Royal Post, USPS, etc) and when to use a private courier (Fedex, UPS, etc) is very important. 

**Receiving your package:**

- Give it a few weeks, especially where international trades are concerned. A good rule of thumb is two weeks for a domestic package, six for an international. Don't press your exchangee for updates constantly, but do ask for a tracking number (NOTE: The receipt number sometimes functions as one. They will always receive a receipt when sending the package through a post office) once just so that you're aware of the status of the package. 

- If a tracking number costs extra, just ask for a picture of the receipt. 

- It's a good idea to have your exchangee include a package note which tells the courier where to put your package, something like ""Please leave behind the bush next to the door"" or ""please leave at front desk"". It's also a good idea to not leave packages on your doorstep if the courier tends to come when you're not home.

- Please make a picture post showing off your package's contents. This does two things. First, it allows anyone searching my name to see that I have successfully traded before. Second, it's entertaining. I really like those posts, they're pretty much the entire reason I made the subreddit. **If you make a picture post, please censor the shipping label.** Any identifying information is fair game to anyone viewing the photo, and there are some sick people out there. Black out names, addresses, and tracking numbers. 

- Please message the mod(s) with a link to a picture post of your package by your exchangee. We'll give you an AK-47 for that, which labels you as a verified sender. "	t5_2rqyn	True

1345126533.0	ybk38	For whatever reason, we've had an upswing in scams lately. Another safety post is needed.	happybadger	56	3	65	"I'll preface this with two things:

1. People are inherently good. Persons can be overwhelmingly shit. Unnecessary cynicism is denying the former and worrying about a subset of the latter.

2. It may not be that we're having an upswing, but people just don't report scams. 

Now for whatever reason, I've had maybe two dozen messages in the past month alone detailing trades that either fell through or that had malicious intent. None of the accounts in question have been AK-47 holders, very few of them are frequently used or established. 

We've more than doubled our population over the last year, a big deal for such a niche subreddit, and with population comes predators. As moderators, there really isn't anything we can do to prevent this without going off-site like Redditgifts, but unless it's adding bold tags to something I couldn't code a 10 print hello world. 

**The vast majority of trades still go through just fine**. I would estimate that 90-95% of trades have no issues and the bulk of the remaining are customs fuckups or simple misunderstandings. The number of reported actual predators on here is so low that you probably have a better chance at being mugged walking down your street than you do being robbed here. 

However, public safety. **If you want to maximise your chances of a successful trade, follow these tips:**

1. Only trade with AK-47 holders if possible. In all the fallen-through trades, we've had *one* reported where an AK-47 holder screwed someone over. He was a crazy fuck and we would have promptly banned him if he didn't delete his account. 

2. **CHECK USERPAGES**. That day-old account may be here for the community, it's happened, but chances are they're using a throwaway to get free snacks. Six months, 10.000 combined karma. That's my arbitrary number for considering an account trustworthy. If you want to play exceedingly safe, that's a good number to follow. Does it mean that anyone under it is out to fuck you? Not at all, but statistically they're far more likely to. 

2. Only send if you have either confirmation that your exchangee has sent (tracking number, postal receipt) or confirmation that they actually have a box (pictures, some sort of timestamp showing that it's a real box and not just a picture from a previous trade)

3. Send confirmation of some sort when you send your box, or **send weekly updates if you can't post your box for any reason**. A lot of reported trades stem from communication issues. Real life happens, every single person here experiences that and gets it. You don't have to be explicit, just let them know that something personal got in the way of you posting. If you want, message a moderator and we can do that for you. This is not a free pass and you are still responsible for sending a package, but a few weeks' delay isn't apocalyptic.

4. Make sure both you and your exchangee know customs regulations for the countries you're sending FROM and TO. Customs agents are cops who failed their psych exam. They take this out on everything that passes through their facility. If you aren't up to date on their arbitrary regulations, you're playing right into the hand of a thirty-five year-old who woke up to find that his life is halfway over and he's done nothing with it. Don't entertain him.

5. Give it a few weeks. Especially with transoceanic packages, it can sometimes take up to two or three months for a parcel to arrive. That's just the nature of international shipping. For domestic and continental trades, two to three weeks is normal. For international and transoceanic, four to six is still probably on the low side. Until that time frame is up, don't worry. 

6. You're responsible for your own safety. I'm reiterating this because it pisses me off tremendously. We don't have tools beyond a ban button. Banning does nothing when making a new account is a ten second affair. If we could we'd watch over every exchange like a helicopter mum, but we can't. If you aren't vigilant, the only thing we can do is minimise the damage for the next trader. If you think that sucks as much as we do, [go here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins) and request better mod tools relating to real-world interaction.

1349373572.0	10y3tk	For those if you who are concerned about sending Kinder Eggs to the US. 	TomorrowsHeadline	61	5	46	"I'll try to be short, here. When shipping from other countries to the US, a common item of interest is the Kinder Egg as we haven't had them here in the States for quite a while. You should keep the possible risks in mind before sending those nostalgic delectable spheres of fun. 

The pros of receiving a Kinder Egg are obvious: the chocolate is great and there's a special prize inside. However, there are four different scenarios that can play out when an egg is sent. They are: 

1) The box goes unnoticed by customs. The recipient gets his egg and everyone wins (common, has happened to me.) 

2) Customs notices the eggs, searches through the box, gets rid of the chocolate, and puts the prize and wrapper back in your box. http://i.imgur.com/GS7xx.jpg 
(Fairly common, this is a picture I took after this happened to me. )

3) Customs seizes your eggs and sends you a letter saying you can pay a large fee to receive the remnants (rare, only seen once for the entire subreddit). 

4) Customs seizes the whole box, causing 

A) A major delay in delivery, or. 
B) A snacker never receiving their parcel. 

This is extremely rare, but it has happened. 

The route they take usually is 1 or 2, DEPENDING ON HOW MANY EGGS YOU SEND - MORE EGGS = HIGHER PROBABILITY OF SEIZURE!  

After the risk analysis, what I recommend for all of my fellow snackers is that you should send the Kinder Eggs if you want, but only send a couple at most. The risk is very low at that point; but the more you send, the higher the risk.

Edit: as several of you have pointed out: There's a lot of candy that's just better than the eggs. Kinder Country, etc. are all amazingly delicious and are better than a thin chocolate shell. If you want to get a toy, then risk the Kinder Egg. If you want chocolate: go for something else. "	t5_2rqyn	True

Not sure if this has been done before here, but [**here is my ready-to-ship box-of-snacks(patent pending).**](http://i.imgur.com/76kOI.jpg)

Something for everyone in there, and I only picked out things my ugly Amercian taste buds actually enjoy. [**Here's a closer look at the pork jerky, there are 2x of each flavor inside.**](http://i.imgur.com/4hD5H.jpg)

Free to a good home? Is that what the title said? No. So stop assuming. In any assortment of the following, I'd like sent to my home in non-sequential, unmarked ~~bills~~ bags of David Sunflower seeds (spicy, nacho, or classic), Keebler Grasshoppers,  any Reese's snacks, non-brand name beef jerky, Laffy Taffy (if you dare send yellow, I'll go Taken on your ass), Little Debbie Nutty Bars, Carmel Apple Suckers, Almond Joys, or Twin Bings if you live in the midwest. How much? Well, before shipping, my set cost $30 USD. If you are more generous, I'm the guilty type and will probably include more.

**P.S.** This is  a standing offer, so anyone that sends to me, I'll send back. PM me for my address.

Keep up the good fight and we will continue to do our best checking in on posts, getting your legit posts from the spam filter when it goes nuts, awarding flair, and addressing your concerns about exchanges.

1339686314.0	v1q8l	I've been on a quest for a specific Solen candy bar for 7 years. Anyone in the Middle East (or elsewhere) that can help? USA/California trade in return :) (Full story in comments)	mildcaseofdeath	52	6	16	"I'm a new poster here, but have subscribed for a while because the idea behind this sub is amazing. I'm hoping someone might be able to help me on my quest...wall-o-text, activate!

I was in Iraq in 2005, and was in the little shop on my FOB (forward operating base) when saw a box of candy bars and remembered my wingman recommending them to me. **They're called ""Vip"", and they are/were made by Solen in Turkey.** I bought one and ate it right away, and it was love at first bite: it's a 3x2 egg crate of wafer (like in a Kit Kat), with each little ""bowl"" filled with chocolate creme; more chocolate creme 'glues' a flat piece of the same wafer on top; the whole thing is dipped in chocolate; then flip the whole thing over and each little ""mound"" is drizzled in a contrasting chocolate. There's nothing like it in the US, and I immediately bought a whole box.

I developed a habit...I'd brave the heat and rocket/mortar attacks (literally) to go to the little shop to buy a box of 12 for $6 USD - or 24 for $12 USD, I don't remember - and come back and sell half of them to my platoon for $1 USD each...eat the other half of the box and use the money to buy another one. It was a good system, but alas, we moved FOBs and I couldn't regularly find them anymore. The last time I found one I [saved the wrapper](http://i.imgur.com/9QIjP.jpg) so I could [get more sometime](http://i.imgur.com/RX6oV.jpg). (Never mind the little flashlight in the pics, I needed it to hold the wrapper flat...for scale purposes though that flashlight holds one AA battery.) The wrapper has (I think) Turkish, Russian, Arabic, and English on it, making me suspect they may be export only...but not to the US.

I've had that wrapper for 7 years, and every once in a while I've done some digging trying to find it. I emailed Solen and they were quite nice but said they had no distributor/s for North America IIRC. Digging elsewhere on specialty candy sites has returned nothing. So I come to you Reddit...

I offer a trade from the US/California for a case (or ten haha) of these awesome Solen Vip bars. That goes for US servicemen and women as well (care package, 12 o'clock!). I am close to locally famous Stone Brewery, as well as a diversely stocked commercial dried fruit and nut business, and many other interesting things. Just let me know what you'd like/what's legal for me to send you. I don't have sky-high karma but this is my primary/serious bidness account, and I have no intention of scamming anyone. Just want to invite over a couple Army buddies and nostalgia *hard* over some awesome candy bars. So can anyone help? :) And again, sorry for the wall of text/exhaustive backstory.

Edit #1: a very helpful redditor found me some links; emails have been sent, here's to going the minimum order isn't a full pallet. Okay, I lied, I'd eat a pallet of them, I just hope they're not prohibitively expensive. I'm still open to trades however, considering it's more fun that way (and likely faster and less expensive)."	t5_2rqyn	True

1307852954.0	hxl0m	Don't buy from Edible.com. No tracking, TERRIBLE customer service, and I'm not even sure they sent out my gift.	readyfuels	53	8	22	"I was going to post this on Wednesday, I'm too pissed to put it off.

Long story short, I got my match ants from Edible.com. Literally two minutes after I ordered, I found it on ThinkGeek for considerably cheaper. Being of limited income, I asked if I could cancel my order on Edible, saying that I hadn't meant to order because I thought that was less tacky than saying ""I'm a broke asshole."" Got an email back saying I could change the address, but not cancel. Clearly that didn't help, so I left it and moved on with life.

Two weeks later, I have no tracking number, no confirmation of delivery, nothing. A little concerning, so I e-mail. No response. Day before three weeks since ordering, still no response and my giftee doesn't have his gift. So I e-mail again, this time with a bit more concern (still polite, though), asking if it had been shipped, if I had a tracking number, etc.

I get the following response, emphasis mine:

&gt;Your order was sent over 2 weeks ago,

&gt;**It was not our fault you made an order as a joke** - we are running a business here.
&gt;
&gt;As it says on our website your order is subject to US customs clearance at your risk and you need to be patient.
&gt;**We do not use tracking numbers** with AIrmail.

""It's not our fault you made an order as a joke."" I never said I was. I said I wanted to cancel my order and didn't mean to make it. 

""You need to be patient."" It was going to be three weeks to the day the following day, and it said up to three weeks. 

Also, how does a company not give *any* confirmation of shipping? I have absolutely no proof that they shipped anything at all.

I sent my first ever angry customer email back without really thinking, basically saying I hadn't made the order as a joke, and that he didn't need to be a jerk and assume. I got a one line email back:

&gt;You should expect this anytime in the next week as long as US customs does not stop it

And that's it. Giftee has not received his package, and I guess I'm just supposed to assume that ""customs took it."" I understand that shippers can't control what customs does, but I'm really uncomfortable with the fact that I'm supposed to just *assume*, with absolutely no proof, that it was shipped, and that it was seized by customs.

If it's not there by Wednesday, I'm going to get him something ELSE from ThinkGeek, because A) I want to be part of the gift exchanges and B) I refuse to give those assholes anymore of my business. 

Meanwhile, I'm out the money that I gave to Edible based on their word alone.

**TL;DR:** Don't buy shit from Edible.com. They don't track packages and are rude as hell if you dare to ask for one."	t5_2rqyn	True

1354811385.0	14e0s1	State of the subreddit	happybadger	59	10	36	"So the mods have been quiet for a few months now, and we've also been [pretty stagnant](http://i.imgur.com/oyrlm.png) as far as subscriptions go (anyone know what happened on 8 November? My metareddit feed doesn't go back that far). 

Growth is my main concern, but it's something of a double-edged sword. On one hand, we're already the largest snack-related community online and I'd like to double or triple our numbers so that we have a lot more representations from smaller countries (you can only look at American and English sweets so many times before you start having Vietnam War flashbacks). On the other hand, it's going to up the number of bad traders and reinforce our need for better regulation. 

To that end, we really could use more promotion. We're only averaging [about one comment per day referencing the subreddit](http://metareddit.com/monitor/dumiC/snackexchange) in others. Granted it's a niche subreddit, but the more you get the word out the more trading opportunities you have from more places. Especially in country/city subreddits, cross-posting and namedropping can be a huge boost to our number of traders. 

As far as the mod situation goes, I think most of us are pretty burned out. This is one of those subreddits where the sky isn't falling every other day and 99% of the messages we receive are just asking for AK-47s. Our active mods also usually moderate much larger subreddits with a stupidly high volume of mod messages, leading to a lot of snackexchange messages being lost in the crowd.

To that end, if anyone wants to mod this or /r/mysterybox, which is facing a similar problem, and is pretty established on the site, by all means you're welcome to join us. 

Third, scamming. It's pretty much as it's always been, a very small portion of the trades but enough that it's worth reminding everyone to [**CHECK USERPAGES BEFORE MAKING A TRADE**](http://www.reddit.com/r/snackexchange/comments/q73dc/the_guide_to_successful_trading/). That really is the key to a successful exchange. Inactive, new, and trollish users should be approached with caution. That's not to say they're all scammers, but the vast majority of scams come from these three groups.

That's about all really. The floor is open if there are any concerns, ideas, or questions. "	t5_2rqyn	True

Any threads posted during that time through circumventing the CSS will be removed (edit: I'm an idiot. We'll just change it to approved submitter mode). My /r/fifthworldproblems will be doing the same thing, and ideally I hope to get /r/todayIlearned and /r/listentothis on board as well. 

Call: To meta-quote myself like some kind of narcissistic schmuck:

The internet is one of the most important creations in all of human history. Not only does it serve as a bank of human knowledge and creativity, but to the individual it is a platform through which for the first time in history every person has the ear of every other person to say whatever they want however they want. It transcends every barrier we've ever erected between the individual and the state and the individual and the individual, it rewrites the status quo and makes it meaningless, and it stands a monument to everything we've ever said or done and all that we will in the future. It's so mindfuckingly important that we don't deserve it, but we have it and it's ours to defend against those who don't understand it.

**ALL** websites, regardless of where they're registered and what their target audience is, are routed through ICANN and Verisign. These companies are both American and based in the US. That means that the Ukrainian board of tourism and Click'clack's personal page in Somalia are both bound to American law. This draconian act and the ones that follow are not limited to the US, they affect **EVERYONE EVERYWHERE**. 

You each have the ability to reach hundreds or thousands of people directly, plus scores more indirectly. [Here is the thread which lets you in on the plan to blackout reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/o7ch9/lets_discuss_sopa_askreddit/), an act that will hopefully encourage larger blackouts and show just how fucked a censored internet is. Join them and join us, as under those acts neither your subreddit nor reddit itself would exist.

I've talked to ""happybadger"" who directed me to go ahead and submit a discount code for a promotion we're running exclusively for Redditors.

The discount is for **20%** off your purchase, which is twice as high as our typical discounts.

Here's the info:

**Website:** [Candy Crate](http://www.candycrate.com/)

**Discount code, all lowerspace:** reddit



**We ship internationally** for our foreign candy enthusiasts!



**Here's a couple links that will work well with the exchange idea**:

1323084046.0	n108g	An international snack exchange partner took advantage of my kindness, took the snacks and deleted his account.  He didn't know that he took from someone with cancer; until now.	kellyetcetera	55	14	25	"To Mike who took advantage of my kindness, this is really disappointing and I'm hurt.  It started with me getting screwed with the Trick-or-Treat....but I thought I would try a snack exchange since I have really been missing some things from home.  I was really looking forward to receiving those treats to help get me through my homesickness and being away from my family during the holidays.  
Yet next to me sits a lovely box of gifts for my Secret Santa that I can't wait to send to hopefully make her smile.  I guess I just don't understand how people can accept something like what I sent that I put a lot of thought and time into and a nice letter.  Mike, you know who you are and I feel certain that you will see this.  I wouldn't accept treats or an apology from you even if you tried.  If you do manage to see and read this, do something kind and selfless for someone else to make up for what you did to me.  What you didn't know about me, Mike, is that you took advantage of a 31 year old woman on disability who has a rare kind of endocrine cancer and is trying to get help from specialists outside of my home country.  
So the next time you, or anyone else for that matter, even think of taking advantage of someone's good heart, remember that you don't ever really know the sacrifices someone is making to send a smile your way.

Edit:  I went to bed last night just wanting to vent and I wake up to see so much more amazingness from Reddit.  The majority of this community is amazing.  I want each of you to know that.  To answer some of the questions, I did not take a picture of the contents before I shipped them.  The proof I have of the shipment is a tracking number and many, many messages in my inbox that now show his name as 'deleted' where his user name used to be.  Most of the messages started rolling in full of excuses as to why he couldn't ship it yet, after I sent him his tracking number.  The snack exchange was my Dutch snacks for his American snacks.  And to give you an idea, I didn't ask for much really....I just wanted some baking soda to bake with when I can because I can't find it anywhere in the Netherlands, hah!  And some cream cheese icing which is one thing I really miss.
The reason I decided to make this post was to just make people who participate a little bit more aware.  You don't know how little or how much the person behind their user name has.  What I wanted 'Mike' to know is that despite trying to live on $700 USD a month and being disabled, I still save so that I can do a little for others less fortunate than myself and because it makes me feel happy to share snacks from another part of the world I wouldn't have been able to experience if it weren't for being ill.  
I appreciate, from the bottom of my heart, all of the offers to make up for my exchange gone wrong.  I know that every single one of you would selflessly share with me and the way that makes my heart feel is indescribable.  I don't want you to think I don't appreciate it, but I would just feel wrong letting someone else spend their hard earned money on me.  If you'd really like to send me something, you can always send a postcard from your corner of the planet. :)  You all really are amazing; thank you again."	t5_2rqyn	True

1296374640.0	fbq3x	Reminder(?): Magic snacks are fair game.	happybadger	49	10	38	"With [this](http://www.fastcompany.com/1721583/farewell-four-loko-here-comes-canna-cola?partner=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+fastcompany/headlines+(Fast+Company+Headlines\)) other THC-infused drinks gaining popularity, there's a proper market for snacks that make you high.

Now obviously you can only trade this to people with medical licenses, but aw shuckerserdoodle I don't seem to have any way of verifying that and will just have to ask that mods assume everyone has the appropriate license when trading. Especially myself. I have like 30 of them. Srsly, ones for all drugs. Sell me drugs.

That being said, there are two rules to magic snacks if they're allowed. 

1. Boil/steam off labels. This is especially important if you're trading overseas as customs tends to open things and a giant pot leaf can't be a good thing for them to find. Make your own label instead, something innocent like Crazy Uncle Steve's Sitonmylapolade. That's not really innocent though because it references child molestation, and you should also boil/steam off any references to child molestation. Especially molested children. You don't want to send a molested child through the post. I will review every sex abuse trade and may ban users depending on the circumstances and my own level of participation. 

2. If making your own magic snacks, please include non-magic snacks that look more appealing. This is more of a courtesy thing. If that package falls into the wrong hands, someone could have a bad experience. Drugs are not for everyone, especially mushrooms and cannabis (anxiety), and it's not fun to trip when you're not expecting it. 

I'm like 90% sure I've posted this before, but it's midnight and I'm high and promoted the subreddit in /r/drugs so we might see a small influx of users. Trading magic snacks is m'kay, but be smart about it and totally have the license though it's a right shame I can't check that. 

Last night I had a dream about a bus. That is all. Keep calm and carry on.

He brought some home for everyone to try, and they were very delicious.  My husband did not immediately eat his, and was saving it for a rainy day.  I was unaware, and ate it because I thought he didn't want it.  I had no idea how much he was looking forward to eating it (he is a great lover of snacks).  I know I will never hear the end of it unless I can find a way to get him that snickers bar! 

I would be willing to trade any American snacks.  I live in the west- so the most unique thing I can think of are suckers that have a scorpion in the center. 

This would be my first trade.  Thanks!

About a month ago I made a thread offering Swedish sweets and snacks in exchange for skittles. Snoron sent me a PM and we started talking and such but when I found out the shipping rates for sending packages from Sweden I told him that I couldn't send him candy because it would be too expensive for me. 

But what I did not know was that Snoron was a GGG. He sent me another PM a few days after i had told him that i could trade with him, telling me that he would send me skittles anyway! So here I am today, with three different types of Skittles, and all thanks to SNORON! :D

Thank You Snoron for the Skittles, and thank you Reddit for providing such a nice community.

tl;dr
shipping rate was too expensive
, but a GGG sent me candy anyway :D

All in all, it's some pretty quality stuff. 

Now most of this stuff I don't use. It tells a story, sure, but it's nothing that I use on a day-to-day basis. That last notion, that my stuff tells the story of me, has gotten me thinking. 

r/Snackexchange exists because I want people to quite literally take candy from strangers and because I want them to experience other cultures. It's an exercise in trust and in cosmopolitanism, and it serves its purpose well. However, you don't really get a feel for the *other person* with a snack exchange, just where they live.

A box of stuff, on the other hand, would show you both the person *and* the place. There'd be two rules- that you can only buy 10% of the box and that you can't ask what's in your sender's box until you receive it. You would fill a box with things from around your house, not so much spatulas and rubbish but things that tell your life story without words, and send it to your exchangee along with a letter explaining everything. They would in-turn send you a box of stuff, and then when they're received you post the standard picture thread. 

I really like the idea of reddit becoming a more personal experience, and this subreddit would accomplish just that. Would anyone be interested?

1335192053.0	so7bv	Different types of user verification and you: a patriot's guide to not being fucked.	happybadger	38	4	20	"I was going to make this a whole thematic thing but I spilled a soda and nope.

Anyway, this is being posted as a PSA in response to a recent post wherein one user traded with an unverified user because he had a verified email address. We've a lot of new faces and reddit isn't exactly clear on all of this, so let's go over different verification types and what they mean.

**Verified email**: This means *nothing*. If you make an email account and press a button, you now have a verified email and a matching badge. It's an anti-spam measure from a year or two ago, but it's utterly meaningless in the scope of user trust. Never, ever, ever mistake it for anything other than meaningless.

**AK-47/Pizza Slice:** This means *everything*. A user with an AK-47 (you need to enable custom styles in order to see it I believe) is one who has traded in either /r/snackexchange, /r/mysterybox, /r/spiceexchange, or participated in the Redditgifts.com Snack Exchange #1. The mods of this subreddit and the aforementioned personally inspect every user granted an AK-47 like the Securitate or some shit, and they can all be trusted to send again. Pizza slices are no different, they're just given if you absolutely cannot have a gun next to your name (think religious and personal conflict).

**Other Emblems:** Eventually I'd love to round up all of the exchange subreddits and consolidate our flair lists, but right now that's a metric tonne of manual labour which would take up all the free time that I could instead be using to masturbate to pictures of farm animals and cry profusely at the sorry state of my life. For now, it's more or less the same thing as an AK-47 but it's informally recognised. 

Always always always look for one of the above two good forms of verification before trading, and if one doesn't exist use caution (have them send first, ideally with some form of tracking or verification). **We cannot protect you and can only react to assholes retroactively**. Once news of a bad trade reaches the mods, the only thing we can accomplish is damage control. The only users we check are those holding AK-47s, and we check them thoroughly when there aren't any pictures of farm animals around. *Thoroughly.*"	t5_2rqyn	True

**I want some noms!**

*How to make a request:*

* It's better to ask for X than to offer Y, if you offer you might well the inundated with exchange requests and it can be a little daunting. If you know what you like, include this in your post; you'll probably get better results :)
* State your location, this will save everybodys time

**Hmm, this person looks interesting**

*Things to be aware of before starting an exchange:*

* Check their user profile, avoid new-ish users (less than 3 months for instance) and check their comment history to see if they are an active redditor. Should you encounter someone who don't fit those criteria then I would recommend caution.
* Search [/r/BadKarma](http://reddit.com/r/BadKarma) for their username, see if they have a 'record'.

**This person looks legit, lets start a conversation**

*What to agree to:*

* Voice any and ALL problem-foods for you, if you're allergic to peanuts you don't want to open a package filled to the brim with tasty tasty peanut products!
* Agree on a budget, or at least a guideline budget. If you choose to go over it, thats up to you. :) A budget will prevent you feeling bummed if you made an exchange across borders where the currency exchange results in significant volume differences in snacks. Don't get bummed out if you didn't get a truck load, prepare and understand ahead of time!
* Exchange addresses.
* Notify on shipment. If possible, exchange tracking information.

**Alright, I got my snacks ready for shipment, now what?**

*How and what to ship:*

* Ensure that the items you have chosen to send actually CAN be sent. Problem foods typically meats, pastries and vegetables. If your product is heavily processed then its unlikely to be a problem but use common sense! Check with your local post office and the shipping company if relevant if you are uncertain.
* Check '[The Successful Jewish Fisherman's Guide to International Customs Notes](http://www.reddit.com/r/snackexchange/comments/ck7rd/customs_declaration_what_do_we_write/)' for customs information.

**Alrighty! Shipped!**

Now you wait, track your parcel if available and think of the tasty snacks coming your way!

If at this juncture your snacks arrive, POST PICTURES HERE and enjoy! ^_^ ~omf nomf nomf~

If you should be so unlucky as to not recieve your parcel, start a dialogue with your exchangee and see if the problem can be resolved. If you feel that you might have been scammed, post any evidence you may have to /r/snackexchange as well as a cross post to /r/BadKarma. You can link these posts together so people can pick them up in either subreddit.


HAPPY EXCHANGING!

I will send on much Candy and treat and surprises from Ireland in exchange for photos and the sign and you with my mate! 

I dont want any candy myself, but it might be nice to give him some candy as a welcome to Canada present since he will be living there for a while.

This might be a bit mad, and I will also post of on the vancouver subreddit, let me know if anyone is interested and send me a PM and i can supply details. "	t5_2rqyn	True

Gravizt	37	4	54	"Surge was prodused by the Coca Cola company and came in cans that looked like [this.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/58/Surge_Soda_Cans.png) Production and distribution halted in 2002, and caused a bit of an outrage amongst some people. Well, guess what, over in Norway, we still have it. Same soda, same company, different coloring and a different name. Over here, the product is called [Urge.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d0/Urge.jpg) As far as I'm aware it is the exact same soda.

I figured, if any of you would happen to miss the drink, I am more than willing to send some, either in exchange for money (the price of the soda + shipping), or a different product, whatever that may be.

**Update in shipping costs**

0,5 liters *(Internationally)* ~$30

1,5 liters *(Internationally)* ~$35

0,5 liters *(Within  Europe)* ~€15

1,5 liters *(Within  Europe)* ~€18

*Larger quantities are possible, but the shipping cost goes up significantly.*

On top of shipping is the price of the soda. I am not selling at a profit here, but not at a loss either. A 0,5 liter bottle is around $3,2. A 1,5 liter bottle is around $4. As mentioned, the soda can be exchanged for other things than money.

**IMPORTANT EDIT; They are not in fact the same soda. Urge was a predecessor of Surge, and Urge is still being sold in Norway. As far as I am aware the only difference is the coloring agent.**"	t5_2rqyn	True

We're going to exchange Christmaskahzaawhateveratheistscelebrate. We're going to exchange it and we're going to celebrate it. To keep this brief because I owe someone 2000g on Warcraft, here's how we're going to do it:

From now until 31 December, put the holiday you celebrate and the denomination of faith (if applicable) in your title. For example, I'd put [Russian Orthodoxy Christmas] because that's going to be the style of Christmas I'm celebrating this year. Of course fill out the rest as you would normally, then posty posterson. 

These are special trades, and as such there are special requirements. We're not just trading snacks, we're trading holidays. As such, here's what you'll be sending:

- At least one snack that symbolises your country/faith/holiday of choice's way of celebrating.

- Some sort of trinket that pertains to your country/faith/holiday's way of celebrating. Maybe a Christmas tree ornament, dreidel, and so on and so forth. 

- Some sort of brief guide to how you do things in your house/country/faith. Maybe write out a list of popular prayers or songs or a recipe for something your grandmother would make when you were a little tyke. 

Obviously anything beyond that is up to you and your partner, but I really want to have that standard set for what's being sent. Altogether, with shipping included, this should cost around $30-50 max (roughly going on how much it costs to send emergency peanut butter shipments back to friends in England). If that's out of your league, /r/favors may have some people going home for the holidays who would be willing to take your package and ship it local, saving you $20-30. 

Never Asked Questions:

- I'm not religious and this offends me

Neither am I. Let's celebrate anyways.

- Shipping costs too much for one snack

I recommend an envelope if possible, though it may get smushed. International shipping is a bitch no matter what :/

- Will my package arrive the day after I send it if I wait until Christmas Eve to make a trade? 

LOL.

- Is it really worth the hassle for one snack? 

This isn't so much about trading a snack as it is trading a tradition. Holidays really differ from country to country, even between English-speaking countries, and personally I like experiencing different cultures. 

- I hate [derpherp]. Can I request [herpderp] only? 

Yep. Discrimination saves the nation, - Abraham Lincoln

- I don't celebrate anything. Can I make my own holiday, traditions, and festive snacks up on the spot and send that?

Please do. This could be interesting. 

- Will this be for other holidays too? 

Officially? Probably not. Maybe Easter and May Day. Feel free to do it unofficially though. I really want to move this subreddit in the direction of trading a slice of your country along with a slice of your country's food, and that's a good way to do it.

- How can I help?

We're not getting a website or anything as I don't fancy maintaining one, but *PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD AND WELL AND BOLDED CAPSLOCK PROMOTE THE FUCK OUT OF THIS SUBREDDIT*. We need a more global userbase, especially representing Eastern/Central/Southern Europe, South/Central America, Non-Australia Oceania, and Non-Oriental Asia. More people from more places means more and more interesting snacks. 

- I'm going to use this post as a platform for debating religion or something like that.

Please do that in /r/atheism. It has no place here and I will ban you without warning. This is about fun, not debating the existence of anyone's god. We all have our views and nobody's been proven right or wrong yet, so leave it out of /r/snackexchange.

If you make or sell some product and you want to post in snackexchange, that's fine. Feel free to. However, there is a catch. You have to get moderator approval first, and not doing so will mean that your link and you will be removed entirely. 

**What gains moderator approval?**

There are two tiers which you'll fall into. 

1. An established redditor (1 year of membership, 5000 combined karma) with a personal, small-scale business. If you fit this mould, you're free to post without seeking us out but if you do we'll put you on the sidebar. 

2. A lurker or new redditor (1-364 days of membership, under 5000 combined karma) or an established redditor with a large-scale business. In order to post a link to your business, you will need to create a coupon code for reddit of some kind. Message us with that and we'll both let you post (or post for you if you'd like a green tag) and put it on the sidebar for the duration of the campaign.

If you can't abide by this, meh. There are plenty of Chinamans trying to sell plenty of things and the one who does it by the book is the only one we're allowing. "	t5_2rqyn	True

- Put anything that can melt on top, then cover with those cheap cold packs that they sell in supermarkets. You should be able to pick up a box for the price of a pack of crisps. 

- On top of the cold packs place packing peanuts.

- Tape it down tightly. 

If you really want to make sure it gets there intact, buy one of those cheap styrofoam boxes slightly smaller than your cardboard box, line it with the snacks and cold packs, then put it on a bed of packing peanuts and fill around it before sealing the cardboard box.

However this package managed to cross the Atlantic in that short time, it certainly brightened up my otherwise dull and boring day!

I've already tried an Almond Joy and nearly wept upon its deliciousness. We have similar candy bars, but only filled with coconut, and the almond is like the missing piece that completes this little bits of sweet art.

Now i tried a Hershey's bliss and am awestruck. The combination of dark chocolate and caramel is divine.

resting_parrot, thank you so so much!

1309460475.0	idi6g	Hey, Snack Exchange, I haven't heard back from my snack exchange recipient in a month. He's a soldier stationed overseas, and I'm concerned.	ecaward	36	3	10	"Hey, guys. I'm not here to bash on my last snacks recipient or anything, because I sent him snacks more as a ""thanks for your service"" than an anticipated exchange. But I messaged him about 4 weeks ago to see if he'd gotten his package yet (He's in Afghanistan), but I'm not getting any responses; and he has stopped posting to Reddit all together since about a month ago.

Like I said, if he got the package, no harm no foul; I wasn't expecting anything in return, I just did it because I felt like it. But I'm concerned that he hasn't posted or responded at all; a simple ""yep, I got it thanks"" would suffice.

Does anyone know if packages are just VERY slow to bases overseas at the moment? :/"	t5_2rqyn	True

1299733059.0	g0yyn	If we were to do a formal /r/secretsanta-style exchange, what would the rules be?	happybadger	38	4	23	"I'm working on getting something up. It would be a huge boost to our numbers and quite frankly that's needed. However, I want community input on this because my current draft of the rules looks like this:

Pricing: $15 excluding shipping, altogether around $20-25. 

- No psychoactive or illegal snacks, excluding Kinder Eggs because the ban is stupid and you probably deserve to die if you eat a toy.

- Please mind dietary concerns, and please list your requirements on your page (vegetarian/vegan/meatitarian/allergies/preferences)

- No perishable goods unless you seal them in a way that's going to prevent spoilage. 

- No live animals unless you're trolling a Chinese guy by sending him a cat. That would be funny and I'll allow it.

- Homemade goods are allowed, especially if they're awesome. They generally are.

- Please keep it as local as possible. Sending Skittles from Florida to Texas just isn't all that unique. If trading internationally, anything from your country works.

- Picture threads are allowed and encouraged as always. 

- Don't panic. Customs is a dick. 

- Don't be a dick. If someone's picking out their favourite snacks for you, be a chap and return the favour. The golden rule exists for a reason. 

- Someone send a live cat to a Chinese guy. The more I think about this the more I like it. 

- If someone says stop, goes limp, taps out, the exchange is over. They're probably dead from high cholesterol and we encourage that.

BUSINESSMAN FACE! What should the rules be?"	t5_2rqyn	True
1297322252.0	fim0x	New Subreddit: /r/Snackshop	happybadger	34	4	10	"[Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/snackshop)

So unbuttonedfan01 messaged me asking if he could open up something of a shop for Canadian snacks. Personally I love the idea because I hate import stores, so I OK'd it and you can find that [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snackexchange/comments/fi7w3/your_canadian_snack_supplier_is_there_interest/). 

The more I think about it, the cooler this sounds. I think it could be a great subreddit, redditors from around the world buying and selling snacks and making beer money doing it. Just to keep the shops from being deadpooled by exchange threads, I made /r/snackshop as the place to go and will be promoting it as such.

I could go happyhitler with rules, but capitalism sorts itself out. Feel free to charge on top of the item/shipping costs, but know that charging too much takes away business and allows for others to undercut you (American redditors: keep in mind that you're something like 70% of readership. Competition should be fierce for you.). Do anything you want- run specials, sell in bulk, branch off with your own proper site. When we have enough shops, I'll figure out web design and make a map that charts the various shops. 

Fuck yeah heart disease. 


edit: I'm promoting it, and /r/snackexhcange, in [this thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fim2y/what_are_some_smallnew_subreddits_worth_checking/) I don't get karma for .self posts, and more members means more trades from more countries ;D"	t5_2rqyn	True
