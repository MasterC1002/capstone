He also told me that the new song on the setlist is in fact complete, and not just a snippet. Finally, Tomas limped out to the stage on crutches and played the set on one foot, hopping around his side of the stage. At one point during one of his solos, the rest of the band mimicked him by hopping on one foot and laughing. 	t5_2qhe1	True

""Hello all,

So there are two ways to say this, and here they are, one after the other:

The Short Version.
Both the Streetlight Manifesto album ""The Hands That Thieve"" and the Toh Kay companion album ""The Hand That Thieves"" are being pushed back to a later release date, presumably sometime in January, 2013.

The Long Version:
So, first off, I'd like to apologize to everyone who has been waiting for this record to come out as originally announced, on Nov 6th. I'd normally say ""on behalf of everyone in Streetlight"" but that'd be misleading. I am entirely and solely at fault for the delay of these records and I take full responsibilty for it. I simply put too much on my plate and lined up too many deadlines and tours, and I just couldn't finish everything in time, between writing, recording, planning and my now notorious but unavoidable tendency to remix, rewrite and, in general, redo everything a few times before it's ""just right"". We announced the album prematurely and in a rush because of a number of factors that lined up in August, and since then I was unable to meet some critical deadlines in order to get the records handed in in time for a Nov 6th release. As the time continued to tick by, I tried to line up a slightly later release date, but I failed in meeting the deadlines for that date as well. I was waiting to announce the delay until we had a certain, solid release date but that just hasn't happened yet for a number of reasons, so it's time to let the cat out of the bag: We're looking at January of 2013 as of now. As soon as I know anything, we'll be announcing it on our site and to try to make it up to you guys as best we can, all preorders will ship with a special gift, one that will hopefully ease the frustration of the prolonged wait.
In the meantime, we are on tour, playing a number of new songs from the album, and we'll be sharing live versions of the songs soon, as well as (finally) some proper samples from the record(s). 
Once again, I humbly and whole heartedly apologize for the delay. I've let down our fans, and I've let down the other members of Streetlight, with my constant remixing, rewriting, starting again from scratch and making promises i end up unable to meet. I am sorry.

Thanks
Tomas"""	t5_2qhe1	True

No big ska band/tour is taking any small acts with them. Streetlight and Reel Big Fish were touring together for three years as if they needed each others support. Now Streetlight has resorted back to pop-punk bands and Reel Big Fish is taking Potthast and the Pilfers around for a while. 

Take the biggest tour of the past four years that recently swept through the Northeast. All great ska headliners and reunions in one show. Pietasters, Pilfers, Spring Heeled Jack and (in Boston) Big D and a Stray Bullets Reunion. Great on Paper.

You telling me there's not one smaller band you can invite on tour to get some exposure? The Snails? Royal City Riot? Green Room Rockers? The Pomps? The Forthrights?

Maybe I'm just old and cranky but it's getting aggravating."	t5_2qhe1	True

We bring a tablet with Pandora streaming wherever we can.  The problem is the language in most of the songs.  As funny as it would be for my son to repeat some of that my wife would kill me.

Any advice on music a really bright and observant 4 year old could listen too?

He does really like the song Mr. Smiley by Mustard plug, although that probably isn't a good one to let him hear either haha.

EDIT:  Thanks for all the suggestions.  This got far more replies than I thought it would.  Thank you for chiming in should make for a happy baby and keep the 4 year old from repeating things he shouldn't.

I found a CD I made a while ago for a car trip and forgot about here is what was on it.

No, not the sieg heil-ing fascist assholes, but the working class kids in britian who didn't want to be hippies and were eating up everything that came out of Jamaica. Skinhead reggae was a genre created by Jamaican ska and reggae artists in the late 60's. Traditional skinheads are not racist, like the ugly and dreaded ""boneheads"" that are. So be careful who you slam as a skinhead, and know what you're saying. No, not ""white"" proud, it's all about the music and unity. If you love that early rocksteady stuff, fancy yourself in boots, like to drink, like to dress sharp, and get into the occasional brawl standing up for yourself.... you're already halfway there. 

Just putting that out, because I didn't imagine there being any on here. Yes, I am a proud skinbird, and it's not just a scene; it's a way of life. Keep the faith!

You can stream this stuff before deciding to download. It's mostly instrumentals and riddim tracks in more of a traditional/skinhead vein, but there's some third-wave in there, as well as some vocals and horns.

As the description indicates, these are from a disc the label owner gave me a few years back as a preview of some of A1's upcoming releases. Some of this got released in other versions, but a lot of it is totally unheard (and it's made available for free download with permission).

A1 was *extremely* prolific, not in terms of actual releases, but in terms of the amount of material they recorded. It was essentially one guy playing most of the instruments on the recordings, with a rotating house band backing up singers for live shows."	t5_2qhe1	True

Chris usually comes up with a set list, then we all tell him it sucks, then he writes another one that we say sucks too then he comes up with the first set list again and we're like ""Thats not that bad"".

**2. Is there a story behind the song ""The Rest of My Life""? I am aware that Mark Hoppus co-wrote it, and there is no saxophone but maybe JR can shed some light on it. It's one of my favorite Less Than Jake songs, and it is a change from the fast paced songs (that I also love) that LTJ normally makes. And I'd love to see ""Pete Jackson Is Getting Married"" played live more often!**

I wrote that song with Mark and Vinnie. Mark had the majority of the song written. I just rearranged it, changed some melody, added a bridge and maybe changed keys? Vin wrote all the lyrics. Mark was a cool guy to write with and we enjoyed the experiment.

**3. Why, exactly, will you never go back to New Jersey?**

Have you ever been there?? If not, go there then get back to me.


**4. Who are your favourite bands from the current crop of UK ska bands? (The Skints, Sonic Boom Six etc)**

The Skints, Streetlight Manifesto, The Have Nots, Reel Big Fish...they're new right? Aaron said they were new...


**5. Ok I hate to be the one asking this question, but you guys seem like you always have a lot of fun, so my question is: what is your wildest story (doesn't need to be long) that you have from being on tour?**

I went to a S&amp;M dungeon with Fat Mike, the rest of NOFX, Most of Bad Religion and some of Sum 41 in Tokyo a few years back. I got tied up, whipped, candle wax poured on me and my balls stepped on. THEN it got weird....


**6. You guys are releasing live recordings of your albums, do you plan to do this with Borders And Boundaries, Anthem, or maybe even In With The Out Crowd? Cause I fucking love Borders in Boundaries and wish you would play more of it live.**

Yes, Yes and thank you. I like that record, too.


**7. Why did they feel the need to re-record Look What Happened? The original is vastly superior, in my opinion.**

We actually weren't going to rerecord it but either our producer (Rob Cavallo) or A&amp;R guy had a hard on for that song and wanted us to re-record it. We've done it before (See: Johnny Quest and Jen) so we didn't think too much of it.


**8. Why won't you guys ever play ""We're All Dudes"" live? I asked Vinnie and his answer was unsatisfactory. If you can play the iCarly theme song, surely this song from a classic movie isn't too embarrasing...**

Because we didn't sing on it. Kel Mitchell wrote the words and he threatened to sue us if we ever performed it live and didn't pay him performance royalties. Fuck that guy.


**9. Why did LTJ drop the ska / horns for a while, only to go back to it?**

I have been in the band for 12 years and have played my horn on every record. We have ska songs on every record. We also have been writing songs without horns since the beginning of the bands career, so this sort of question makes me think ""Wow. What an uninformed retard."" Then I feel bad for thinking you're a retard and apologize to you silently without you knowing it. So here's my outward apology for thinking you're a retard.


**10. How did you get the opportunity work with LTJ? Were they concerned that you played tenor rather than bari?**

We had a mutual friend that suggested me to the guys after Derron quit. I don't think they were as concerned with the horn's voicing as much as they were concerned that the person they chose ""fit "". They obviously made the wrong choice.


**11. When writing/recording, is there ever friction among the band, or does everyone get along well?**

We're like brothers. We all fight constantly, but I think thats why it works. Opinions make for working harder to come up with a great product, even if all the songs aren't great :)


**12. I'd really like to know more about his past with Spring Heeled Jack, and if we can ever expect anything else from them?**

Someone is apparently doing a documentary on the band so stay tuned...


**13. Whats his favorite song to play?**

The last song on the set list :)


**14. This is more of a genre-based question, but a lot of popular ska bands are slowly phasing out the brass and woodwind. What does he think about these groups becoming ""rock with horns,"" and what are LTJ doing to keep the true form alive?**

We've never been a traditional ""ska"" band. We've always been far more punk influenced. I personally am a HUGE ska fan, however i think there are a lot of ""ska fans"" that aren't as informed as they could be or should be as to the history of the music. Its a blend of calypso rhythms of Jamaica and traditional jazz and blues the originated in the 60's on the island. Anything that wasn't from that time period, to me, is ""ska influenced"" or ""ska based"" music. The only real ska band, in my opinion, are The Skatalites. If you're not sure who they are, check it out. THAT is real ska.

After that whole diatribe, bands switch it up because they get bored. Painters never paint the same piece twice so why should a band write the same song twice? People grow up and get inspired from other things so, honestly, it's not intentional if a band switches sounds. There are a combination of factors that can influence it, which may include their A&amp;R's opinion, manager's opinions, booking agent opinions, co-writer's opinions, producers opinions...the list goes on.

It's hard to make someone who isn' t involved with the music industry fully understand why decisions are made. I've always said when you have your band you can make your own decisions. Seems like a dick head answer, but I'm sort of a dick head sometimes.


**15. How do you deal with homesickness/being on the road so often?**

Cell phones help. Prior to those days, a month tour of Europe seemed like a year. You find ways to get through the tough times and usually my band mates are good at cheering me up."	t5_2qhe1	True

I've seen S.M. three times and  every time i see them i notice more and more frat douches trying to mosh.  I do my best to stay away from them and try and hang out with those skanking.  I don't want to sound like a hipster, but ever since both bands got popular in the past few years, I'm not enjoying the shows as much (don't get me wrong i still love going).  Normally hipsters complain about something, even if it's not a big deal.  More people coming to the shows isn't a big deal, if anything, it's a good thing.  It means the bands are getting more money and hopefully will tour more.  But really, for the frat douches who decide to start moshing, really.....  First off ska is upbeat and happy (although a lot of the lyrics are sad).  Last night some guy in a pit got punched in the nose, went unconscious, he broke his nose, and had to be carried out by a few guys to an ambulance. There's no need for that at a ska show.  Also to the girls who work there way into the middle of skank pits and just dance with out moving.  Why are you so suprised when you get kicked or knocked over?  Serious;y i wish people smartened up at these shows.  I don't know if I'm the only one who feels this way but the shows haven't been the same.	t5_2qhe1	True

Now that RBF has released their newest original studio album, I've been reading through reviews after finishing the initial listen-through. It seems that a lot of people have been saying that the songs are bland and ultimately, all sound the same. And while there are a few tracks on the album are interchangeable, it's totally unfair to claim it of the entire album. The songs are what should be expected from RBF, a lot of quick upstrumming, catchy, not-so-deep lyrics, and memorable melodies. Just from the bit I've listened to, I'm absolutely loving Everyone Else Is An Asshole, Hiding In My Headphones, She's Not The End of the World, and Don't Stop Skankin'. I will admit, I may have built up anticipation for this album a bit too much in my head, and it didn't live up to what I expected, but it's still an awesome showing.
