Looking for Visual Basic developers to write a compiler.	kuba_10	60	7	21	"Standard programming languages tend to require vast amounts of code to do even quite simple tasks. Small projects may build up thousands of lines. So why do we stick to them? Let's move to the language of the future: SlashTalk. 

The idea of SlashTalk is effective use of commonly known and used operator //, found in C-like languages. SlashTalk does a 360 spin and changes the way // is used to make programming accessible to anyone who can read.

How does // work? Let's see on an example: a quicksort function.

    function quicksort (param_table tab) {
        // quicksort tab
    }

Simple, isn't it? But it's not yet the fastest implementation. In general, the more detailed the description is, the more effecient output you get. Optimization peaks when there's a wikipedia link after //.

Another example is a rand function.

    function rand() returns int {
        // do stuff
    }

The language doesn’t make you elite; it is what you do with it. If you only knew how you sound. Just shut the hell up. You sound like a bunch of bigoted zealots from the old south.

You C sharpees kill me to death. I think you find VB a little confusing so you pick C# the easier language. As far as I'm concerned VB is the more superior language whether it is in the hands of a real programmer or not. VB is not the straight jacket that C# tends to be. VB allows many more ways to skin a cat. Where C# may seem lean and agile it looses its flare and edge. I must contend that C# is not a language of a true artist but then true artists do use the thing. What I’m saying is that language is neutral in a common language infrastructure environment (.Net, Mono, Delphi). So off course if you use one then learning the other is redundant, unless you have to. I would always choose a VB background over C#, C++, java etc, and I won’t tell you why mister smarty pants. Lets be real, you are only building business applications. That is not rocket science or dare I say it, neither is it computer science. The phony elitism by these guys is beyond asinine and I will address who the real idiots are later. What I want to know is have you built any new technologies lately. Oops, sorry about that low blow to the testicles. Just having a little mean spirited fun at your expense. I’ve been ignoring this crap from you guys for years. So back atcha. You try to persuade that VB and its users are inferior for all the wrong reasons. I’ve used Basic, VB, Assembler, C++, java, oh what ever. C# is not a new invention friends. C# is just a C, C++ and java knockoff. C# is a bastard 3 generations removed and you want to bust our balls. Yes you guessed it; I don’t intend to relieve you of your ignorance. I like you just the way you are. I don’t want to persuade you to like or use VB. Why, because I enjoy feeding my arrogance with your ignorance. So on that point I am leaving you in the dark where I found you.

In the end VB and C# are just tools. The real intellect comes from choosing the one that suites you and the job best. The tools don't make the man, the man makes the tools.

Sharpees also try to put on airs because they are able earn slightly better pay then Vebras (VB developers). I just love bursting this little Arian fable you guys like to spin about. As Yoda would say, ""Well rounded, you are not"". It is a simple matter of economics (supply and demand), there are far fewer C sharpees. If you intend to get one of the little buggers you will have to pay a premium. Do you remember PowerBuilder and SQL Gupta. Well that’s good because that’s all they are now, a memory. At one time they both commanded more than VB in the market place. So there you are my little grass hoppers. Those Idiots use the same dumb arguments you like to spread around today. Here is my Mr. T impression, “I pity the Fools”. It’s easy to hop on a bandwagon, the trick is being savvy enough to hop on the right one. VB is still here and they are not. There you go hot shots, so you can stop clicking your boots and saluting Hi-Hitler. If sharpees had any real sense they would just shut the hell up. Why would you want more people to start using your language and bring down your stock (A.KA your earning power). Just shut the hell up. Only an Idiot would bandy such nonsense.

I hope I have offended someone, or we haven’t started having any fun yet. Please read on.

Oh and why do I call C# users C sharpees? The language and the name (C#) remind me of that little ugly dog.

Anyway we have much bigger fish to fry in the near future so it won't matter if you are a vb, cc, dd, c#, blah, blah, Blah.

If you really want to know what the elite is all about I guarantee you won’t find it in C#. If you really want to broaden your horizons you better find out what Linux and Mono is all about. You sharpees don’t even know you are just slaves. Common Language Infrastructure under Linux will set you free. I’m sure most of you want to be elites are scratching your heads now so I will rap this up because I have wasted enough time with you chaps. You now have real elite knowledge. Off course if you where elite as sharpees like to pretend then this thrashing would not have been necessary. In any case we all want to be the best that we can be. I just shared the path with you. You have ability to be much more than just programmers and developers. You should strive to be Computer Scientists. That is what the world needs.

1376446545.0	1kblug	I just invented a new compression algorithm.		34	3	9	"It's actually pretty simple: Interpret a chunk of data as a number and find it's prime factors. If it is already a prime number find the nearest non-prime and store the difference (you need it later for reconstruction!) and repeat previous step. To increase your compression factor you can proceed recursively on your generated primes. But how does one decide how much recursion results in the best compression? It's simple: you'll keep going until you fall below the Kolmogorov complexity of the data you want to compress.

But we can even go further. We can reduce the size by a factor 2 by deleting all the zeros!

1372269755.0	1h4f1i	Some tips on shrinking C code size!	kelmermae	36	9	19	"Consider the following program

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    int main ()
    {
    	const char *message = ""Hello world!\n"";
    	printf(""%s"", message);
    	return 0;
    }

The first thing we can do is remove the ""const"" qualifier on the char pointer, because it's redundant! If you don't want to change a value, just don't change it! Don't bother consuming more memory and increasing code size.

    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    int main ()
    {
    	char *message = ""Hello world!\n"";
    	printf(""%s"", message);
    	return 0;
    }

Next we can simplify the printf statement. You really don't need to feed it as explicitly a string. You can use printf(message);! This won't open up any vulnerabilities either, and it's especially useful to directly relaying user input without parsing it.

    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    int main ()
    {
    	char *message = ""Hello world!\n"";
    	printf(message);
    	return 0;
    }

Finally, variable naming. Why do we really need full descriptive words for variables if we know exactly what they do?

    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    int main ()
    {
    	char *m = ""Hello world!\n"";
    	printf(m);
    	return 0;
    }

And there it is! Code that does the same thing but with a much smaller code size! It's more clear, quicker to write, and has significantly increased performance because it doesn't push on the CPU's RAM chip drives as hard a cycle calculator would normally indicate when attached to a multimeter."	t5_2u9xe	True

Does there exist a programming language which allows you to open loops anywhere in the code?  I am growing increasingly frustrated by the forced structure in traditional languages where you can't open a new loop in the middle of strings.  Yes, there is likely a reason why this is not done in traditional languages but I'm not very interested in the roadblocks.  What language would allow me to, for example in python 3.x,...
Print(SomeString +""""+*loop opening indicator*for x in y: print(x)*loop  close indicator*)
...in order to print out some string followed by the contents of a list? (I'm aware that the preceding is not ""very pythonic"" for that particular instance, but I'm trying to keep it simple.)  Speaking of keeping it simple, I'm going to leave it at that.  If you need any further clarification on the concept at hand let me know.

Names like ""anna"" are very bad passwords. There are programs which can crack those passwords really fast, and in such cases it's very easy for them because it doesn't even matter from which side they start cracking. They could crack from the left or from the right and they'd always get it right. So you could simply use ""pete"" for example, which is a lot safer.

Next thing is: Don't use consecutive numbers like ""12345"". Every cracking program can count to 5. But you can make it harder for them if you do something like ""12435"". That will completely confuse them, and they'll be like ""what the hell, whats going on!?!?"" and just give up.

Always choose a long password! For example the password ""2inches"" would be too short. ""30inches"" is much safer!

Don't use any special characters. This will only make your password stand out from the crowd and attract password crackers.

I also have a secret protip from my co-worker. He said i should use ""xe$8a+iph5k;oxah)Xuch"" as a password, and that it's a really strong password!!
I'm sharing it here so you can all use this password too and be super secure!

Do you guys have any other tips for me?
Thanks in advance!

    &gt;&gt;&gt; *flat, total = [(yield sum((yield from [(yield from sublist) or sum(sublist) for sublist in bumpy]))) for _ in "" ""]
    &gt;&gt;&gt; flat, total
    ([0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 120)

? If you can't tell why I put this to shittyprogramming, tell me what type the RHS of that assignment is. I thought you lot might enjoy this sort of monstrosity.

I was wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction of writing killer codes? I asked Jeeves (you guys should check this out if you havent' heard of it: askjeeves.com), and that gave me a tutorial on how to open the ""Terminal"" (you know, the little black box with all the funny writing into it where you can tell computers to do whatever you want). 

So I go and look up all these ""terminal commands"" and I find EXACTLY what I'm looking for: ""killall.""

Anyway, I'm wondering if somebody can tell me how to use the damn thing... I tried like a HUGE list of things:

killall people
killall people in this room
killall humans
killall of my enemies
killall murderers
killall lawyers

This operator can be chained.

    &gt; var f = function(a){return function(b){return a+b}};
    undefined
    &gt; f )( 42 )( 12
    54

This operator is too new that it does not yet have any name, but I think this can be useful.

Unfortunately, currently this operator is enabled only in Node.js interactive shell. :("	t5_2u9xe	True

1369866313.0	1faqlo	The End of Java	fuzz3289	16	19	27	"Today I was musing about the existence of Java. The big selling point to me at its inception was Write Once, Run Everywhere. It was a cool concept. Force the developers of the Java VM to worry about platform specific implementation and the programmers using the language just focus on getting one set of code done that anyone can use. 

In today's day and age, we have web apps. Some fancy HTML5 mixed in with some splashy CSS with a Python back-end and bam. You've got an application that can run anywhere. Sure you might have some browser specific implementations, but generally speaking you can write one set of cross platform code in the form of a webapp. 

And if you're application is too big for a webapp? Then Java is probably too slow to be worth it anyways. 

Java is full of security holes, performance is dreadful, readability is at best the same as C (in my opinion of course), and cross platform programming can be done in other languages more efficiently and much more cleanly (also slightly subjective). 

My question to you, is Java coming to an end? Does this language have what it takes to cut it in today's world? 

We have languages like Python, Go, C++14, CommonLisp etc, that make Java look slower than Windows 95 and have 10x the readability. If you use Java, speak up, why do you use it? Could you use something else? Or is Android and other legacy Java support going to continue to drag this dead horse around?"	t5_2u9xe	True
