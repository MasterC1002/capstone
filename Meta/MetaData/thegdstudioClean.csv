1346299351.0	z26oe	Downtime sucks...	2GD	146	11	49	"Hey guys, It's been really hard for us at the studio to be 'offline'. we're dying todo content again and new content. Since we went offline to build the new studio, I got hold of some cool dudes and presented to them an opportunity with the gd studio, the opportunity is bigger than just a new studio. and I'm currently waiting for a deal to be finalized, once it is were come back a lot stronger and more regular

for those who sub monthly, If you feel you want to unsub till we come back, plz do. for those who want just to support us and continue subbing, we really appreciate the faith you have in us as a group of eSport misfits who want to push eSports forward in hopefully an entertaining way.

So yeah bottom line Trance keeps e-mailing me asking when we gonna rape stuff... and I'm waiting on some new deals for the studio. so I donno exactly a date of return for 'new stuff'. if new stuff takes too long we'll continue todo the gd show and some other shows between moving.

neways big thanks to everyone, we're only 4 months in as a studio and you've helped us make a lot of noise in eSports and to our current sponsors, this has made moving forward and trying to take the project to the next level alot easier and faster than any of us ever could have imagined

so just a big thanks to all you GDlings out there :)

Well room service is here, 1 last day of work stuff till I host the International. I donno if Valve is ready for my style, maybe I'll pretend im professional, for at least 10 minutes... ok 5."	t5_2ttcw	True

1335818508.0	t0bj5	The GD Studio is recruiting	Tranceh	100	11	36	"Ok guys so if you have watched our latest meeting show you know that we are looking for a bunch of people to help out with various (mostly online) tasks. I will try and list exactly what we are looking for together with a short description.

* **Social media promoters**

Looking for 1-2 people that will be trusted with our social media channel info (twitter and facebook mostly) who can update people about our upcoming shows, tournaments, etc. Also during the live broadcasts they can post updates (mostly twitter) about what game is coming up, facebook promos from the sponsors, etc.

* **Webmaster**

Someone who can handle maintenance of our upcoming site and apply small changes to it when needed. We don't know what language the site will be coded in yet so I will get back to this point sometime in the future.

* **Community sites content promoters**

One person from each of the communities we cover games for (Dota2, Starcraft II, BLC, Quakelive) who can promote, in advance our up and coming tournaments, bigger shows etc. Teamliquid, esreality, gosugamers/joindota, some BLC site which i dont know of, the appropriate subreddits, etc.

* **Experienced Adobe Flash coder**

Well we already have one but he is terribly busy and hard to reach at times so having someone else who can sort stuff now and then would be great. This is about our flash based overlays which are pretty neat but complex, hence the experienced part.

* **Graphics artist**

Mostly for our show posters, some logo now and then, not much to be done here since we already have some templates in place here. Illustrator, Photoshop are the must know for this one.

* **Chat and forum moderators**

We like to keep moderation pretty loose on our chat, and the forum moderation will come into play once the site is up. Rule of thumb, ban anything extremely offensive, go light on everything else. In-depth guide to this once the group is set up.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preferably looking for people in the EU timezones, altho if you're ok with being up at crazy hours we don't mind taking in people from other timezones.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* **So why would I want to do this for you guys?**

a) you love us

b) you love victory cat and her kittens

c) we will be giving all our crew members some GD swag and products once the line is up and running

d) chance to play some games with the studio members now and then

e) if you are Stockholm based there can be an extra treat for you.

f) your e-peen might gain a few extra inches



I hope I have everything covered, if anything else springs to mind I will update this post. Please send all your applications to **trance[AT]twitch.tv** including a short description about yourself in the esports/gaming community, some links to past work (if that applies) and why you'd like to be part of this team :)

He's so passionate, so open-minded, I think it would make for an awesome episode of the show.

I want to learn how to not wither and die in front my computer, and I can't see any better way than to have Martin appear in studio with James and the others, giving us lectures on postures, stretching, exercises and whatever else he may have on his mind!

There's so much knowledge to be gained from this, and it's so sad that the interviews at DreamHack are so short (though understandable - he's at work!), because I'm guessing there's a million more things he'd want to explain and elaborate on.

My suggestion for them to play a marathon of Arma II: Arrowhead. DayZ mod. Games seems like a lot of fun for several people to enjoy and I bet it would be hilarious and awesome.

P.S.: DayZ is a zombie mode for an FPS game Arma II: Arrowhead. You can check out some videos on youtube about it: it's really simple to understand and very hard to play. It's glitchy yet the atmosphere is insane. Hellspawn talked about it in the recent show."	t5_2ttcw	True

Feel free to post any feedback, ultimately keep in mind the emphasis of the website is simplicity, we (or at least I) envision it mostly to be a place to check up the calendar to see what the coming weeks of content look like, look up some old VODs, and see descriptions of shows if you're new, as well as the news section for what people from the studio are up to and such.

One other feature that I want to do is the Weekly News roundups, basically the Wiki that people post here for the show, we use that as a catch all, so any news people want to see covered and aggregated gets put together and published on our news page to work as a one stop place to check up on ALL news from the week, big or small. It will also alleviate some of the problems with The GD Show being too long when we spend time just listing off minor topics that don't have much discussion around them, people can just read up on the weekly news on the website to read about smaller events and results, etc.

So, feel free to post thoughts and ideas and such~

Also funny story, we planned to get the website up today during the show, and so we could announce the DHI schedule with the website coming up, unfortunately Mikael's internet went out so he couldn't transfer anything, and thegdstudio.com just went to a page that said 'hej' and was found and lead to this submission http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1bm0i7/gdstudio_website_now_live/ getting to the top of r/DotA2, lol.

This is just a simplified version of the chat the way that I experienced it. If I missed something good I'm sorry, but do not worry. There are also full lists of the links and stats thanks to Dobs which can be found at http://dobz.net/ircstats/thegdstudio/ and http://dobz.net/ircstats/thegdstudio/links/


[The show](http://www.twitch.tv/thegdstudio/b/394735465) went live nice and early, featuring the return of the production cam, and the first pictures of the day came shortly after. The time refers to how long into the VOD that I first noticed the link. The actual show starts about 33 minutes into it.

You may or may not know, but I'm overly picky with who I am willing to represent (sponsorship wise) with The GD Studio. I'm a bit of a twat like that. I much prefer smaller companies who do the right things with their brand, companies who are close with the gaming communities and aren't just forcing their messages and gimmicky products down peoples throats. companies who I think you and me alike as gamers would appreciate really.

So after reviewing some partners I'd like to represent, I assumed I may not know everyone :)

So I'm interested if you guys know of brands or companies who you think would fit the current 'GD Studio' community?

So just drop some suggestions if you wish!

thanks

You have come a long way and improved your casting and attitude on camera a lot! I actually enjoy watching you do your thing now and would miss you if you left. Way to go, Semmler!

Just if you could please, for the love of god, stop doing the following 2 things:

* Shout-outs: Nobody on TGS does them. You arrived, no reason to greet everyone all the time. A gentlemanly nod will suffice.

* ""Snag"": The reason why the Semmler drinking game claimed the lives of many fellow GDlings. It sounds disgusting and saying that you overuse the word is an understatement if there ever was one. 

But don't let these things distract from the fact that you are way more likeable, comfortable and interesting on camera now! Keep up the good work. :D"	t5_2ttcw	True

Weebian	57	1	9	"So from watching a lot of things on the internet, both live and VODS, I have found that one of the best parts of it can be the chat thanks to their ability to link various things that can in a way enhance your experience. And the chat of the GD Show is no exception thanks to their masterful photoshop skills. Therefore I wanted to give the people who missed out of the live show a way to still feel like they were there by making a list of the pictures and polls to make it seem like you were there live joining in on the fun. This does obviously lack the feel and spammyness of the chat, but should hopefully be fun none the less.


Clearly this is not all of the things that were posted, I tried to keep it to just the things that were linked the most. If you posted something awesome and I missed it I'm sorry, if you spammed something stupid and its not here that is because it was dumb. Oh and some of the pictures are kinda NSFW, no nudity or anything like that, but a bunch of dudes sitting around in their underwear or something along those lines may pop up. Anyway lets get to it.

1350344799.0	11jgcs	I think the GD Show did a good job replacing SoTG.	uw_NB	58	7	9	"We used SoTG as a news podcast as people are still learning and playing SC2. Now as majority of the player based has stop playing the game and turn into viewers, such details into build order/ theory craft are no longer attract people attention. One of the obvious evidence is looking at day9daily stream viewer count comparing to one or 2 years ago: he barely get to 5k while 10k is a small number in the past. This leads to the sudden increase in interest of insight from the proscene, stuff that The GD Show actually does a much better job compare to any esport talkshow in general, base on the information that 2GD leak out: player salary, contract, player scouting, league price pool, sponsors, etc...

Now as i hear SoTG returning, i have to doubt it success. Even though having Apollo on is a plus, the rest of the show hosts dont have that much of a personality in the scene: QXC, Tod are pretty much robots with 0 emotion, Major barely speak english and he isnt matured enough to put up good constructive arguments in this sort of panel. Moreover, even though SoTG2.0 will have primary focus on HoTS, the success of the expansion is still relatively unknown atm. The game is still the same and the game type as well as Battlenet 0.2 are still there, making sc2 an antisocial cave which is extremely unattractive to player but at the same time incredibly entertaining for backsit-gaming aka viewers. As of right now the game design procedure is not going as well and having the public exposure via public hearing(davie forum post) simply will spoil the contents therefore reduce the hype as the expansion released. Having such unstable platform to run a show on is an extremely risky idea and i would not be surprised if the show will go on discontinue after 2-3 episodes.


I am a starcraft fan since BW and have been follow esport forever and i would be really sad if my prediction come true. I want to hear the GDStudio crews opinions on this matter, especially Apollo who personally involved in the show. Thanks for reading.

------------------------------------------------------

PS. Regarding the removal of the Dota2 emotes. We had to remove those as 100 were too many and it would have caused issues with Twitch chat, so we were given a certain limit on emotes we can have by Twitch. So instead of just having 5 or so dota emotes we have decided to remove them all. We might still add dota2 related emotes in the future, just not simple hero emotes.

1339537911.0	uyods	The Curious Case Of The Missing Semmler	Metabie	47	2	5	"A random series of events formed together to create a web of mysteries that baffled many and caused for a great episode of the GD Show.

The day started as Weppas woke up late (2pm instead of 1pm) to pick up Apollo from the airport, who just came from MLG. Apollo got picked up but was a bit moody afterwards. His moodiness lead to Trance becoming moody too which wasn't helped when he had a discussion with 2GD. Weppas started streaming Dota2 and all was good but Trance was still pissed so when the time came to produce the GD show, he didn't want to. This lead to Weppas having to produce the show at which point his phone rang multiple times but he just ignored it since he was producing. An hour and a half later we had reached the conclusion of the GD show but Apollo, who was picking up Semmler from the airport (because Semmler took a later flight) tweeted at Trance to give him a call. Semmler was nowhere to be found! And so the search for Semmler started.

The first lead that The GD Studio followed was obviously the airport, they checked Semmler's flight to see if it had landed and it did, on time. For further information they require the booking number of Semmler's ticket but they weren't able to find this. So The GDStudio decided to call Semmler's girlfriend because they taught trough her maybe they could get this. She updated them with the news that Semmler had in fact called her from the airport in Sweden. Semmler was in Sweden, but why didn't he meet up with Apollo yet.

Semmler's girlfriend informed them that Semmler had asked for Weppas his phone number at which point Weppas realised he got called at the beginning of the show without picking it up. They dialed the number that called thinking it would be a pay phone at the airport, which it wasn't. It was a random number to a random house.

The GD Studio was out of ideas so they decided to call the airport to do an announcement for a lost person. They obviously had to include that Semmler is a special needs child so it was very important. Time passed and hope was getting lost when Weppas finally decided to check his messages. There were 2 messages , the first one which Weppas had heard, not from Semmler and afterwards didn't check his messages anymore. When he finally checked for the second message, they found out that it was a message from Semmler who had no phone,no money,no working card and was stuck at the airport.

At this point The GD Studio had the great idea to take a 3/4G stick and use it to livestream the entire trip towards the airport and the picking up of Semmler. Right as Trance went to pick up the USB-stick, Semmler arrived home.

Turns out his flight had been delayed, there were issues on arrival, he didn't have a phone (Get a fucking phone Semmler or wait don't more fun stories for us), his card was blocked and had no money. He was calling Weppas the entire time but he didn't pick up (obviously trying to murder Semmler) because it was from a hidden number. The ladies at the help desk gave Semmler some money for a bus ticket where from he later took a taxi home.

While all of this was going on the power disconnected once and the streaming desktop blue-screened twice, at the worst time (aka best times) possible.

Crazy Story. Crazy Adventure. Hilarious from start to end.

We're planning to add more subscriber emotes to our Twitch chat after the newly implemented dota 2 ones (http://trance.gg/dota/emotes.jpg) and I thought why not have a little competition for it since I'm sure there must be quite a few of you out there with designing skills. Here's how it goes:

**Guidelines**  

* Emotes can only have a maximum size of 60x30 pixels (width x height)
* Don't shy away from creating emotes based on any of our GD-studio related memes (call the dwarf, sack of shit, whiskey bottles, y u heff to be mad etc)
* Please make an archive and upload your creations somewhere on the web for easy access

**Contest Rules**  

* If we pick 3 or more of your designed emotes you win a GD studio mousepad
* If we pick 9 or more of your designed emotes you win a GD studio hoodie
* If we only pick 1 of your designed emotes you win our appreciation, a strain of 2GD's recently cut hair and a 1 month subscription to our channel (in case you don't already own one).
* We will let this run for about 3 weeks (until 11th of April)

Happy designing!"	t5_2ttcw	True

This way they  will have some nice things to read in 2-3 days time, when they are finished with going back home and resting!

I think we can all agree that it was in its whole a very good tournament for the viewers in terms of both Games and entertainment. The production value was very good as well. I think we didn't expect anything less from the guys. 

That said the main function of this feedback should be (imo) to go in depth about some things. 

------ 

I'll start with my opinions on a couple of things and you can, but don't need to take my format as a sample.

-------  

To start off I'd like to say that this style of production reminded me a bit of the HomestoryCup, mixed with a little bit more of professionalism. 
This mix is great! While we got to see a lot of funny segments, that clearly were like a bunch of guys having fun, we also had good interviews of the players. Everything else was solid production. The venue looked nice (at least on stream), sound and video quality was top notch and despite some confusion on match standings, the visuals that displayed information was good as well.

-------  

**Positive things that should return in future productions:**

**-**Weppas played a great mix of music. Not a repetitive loop of Dubstep and pop-music, but real songs by Acts like Queen. Awesome!

**-**Everyone who worked as caster and host. I was skeptical of Soe, as I don't really care for here somewhat generic Interviews, but she got involved into the show thanks too 2gd which made it better than usual. Semmler is Semmler(Despite common believe he always does a solid job &lt;3)! 2GD and Incontrol are like a crazy surprise bag and TLO with Apollo is a cute love story! Super combinations, bring all of them back!

**-**ALL of the casual behavior! Memes created by the community, teasing Adebisi, drinking a whole can of Monster and flaming each others moms! Not a single tournament does it quite this way. Charming stuff that I absolutely loved.

**-**Switching the ingame music with other music(two steps from hell stuff) There isn't a lot to say about this. Awesome idea, awesomely done.

------ 

**Negative things that I think should be dropped or changed:**

**-**Something I really enjoyed in the GSL are map introductions. Of course just boldly copying another tournament isn't very exciting, but I think you can come up with something creative.(Minor improvement tbh almost nitpicking)

**-**Get big ass checks and not those half size things. THAT is very important!



I honestly can't think about anything else that I felt was bad without resorting to nitpicking. Maybe I am too biased, as I really love your work overall.

**TL;DR:** ASUS ROG was awesome, what do you think? A big thanks for a wonderfull time to all the guys at the studio &lt;3

------  

Also Congratulations to ForGG,skMC and of course Liquid'Taeja."	t5_2ttcw	True

I Really enjoyed todays quake L2P, as primarily a Starcraft 2 follower I didn't really appreciate how important and how closely they follow item timings in quake and just how complex the game can actually become but now I do. 

Was nice seeing James in his element and teaching the game he was originally known for, It seemed with less people in the studio the content was a lot more professional and educational because noone was yelling at one another. (which is a good and bad thing)

Hats of to Weppas as well for producing and I hope the studio does more Quake L2P's in the future because I found it really interesting. I was expecting to become more interested in DotA 2 through the learn to plays rather than Quake but there's something about the Dota 2 L2P format I really dislike.

1340469062.0	vhjni	Semmlers and Trances thought process explained.	Karuramon	38	7	32	"Step 1. You prerecord a show, like L2P DotA2.

Step 2. You keep the material until Step 3. happens

Step 3. Something happens, like James is sick and can't do ""The Meeting"" on the day it is supposed to be

Step 4. Use the prerecorded show for that day, so there is ""something"" instead of ""nothing"", even if it isn't as good because it isn't live

Step 5. No downsides, but an upside for some people, who rather watch something instead of nothing!

Edit to underline it once again:

I like this Idea, because the only thing that happens to us is that we are given MORE content. There is no ""instead""-thought involved. If a show doesn't happen due to any difficulties, a prerecorded show is given to us. But the show that should have happened, will happen as soon as possible. That at least is how I think Semmler intended it.

1337671189.0	tyxod	Appeal to TheGDStudio: Quake live LearnToPlays	ranamudjan	34	1	8	"Hello, guys from thegdstudio! First of all i want to thank you for what you've been doing, i really like the idea of introducing players to other games and merging communities into general esports fans instead of only 1 game audience.

Shame on me, but i first learned of quake live from your first show, the arena (which as far as i remember Cypher has won). In my 21, i've never played q3 or anything before (shame on me again), but i really liked the game and i am really willing to improve at it. Unfortunately, your l2ps come out far away from often enough.

I know it's hard to learn someone to play a shooter game - it's very much about reflexes and general game sense which is hard to explain. However there is still a lot you can teach.

By the time i am writing this post i have learned a lot by my self: general strategy principles, strafejump (i can even sometimes jump to a rail from the bridge on dm6), aiming and other mechanics stuff. But still in lots of situations i feel like i just don't know what's right decision to make. For example, i find really hard figuring out the best openers for different spawns. Or, i often find myself doing bad decision on controlling yellows to fully choke my opponent, while letting him steal main items.

For guys like me practicing in ql is really difficult, because there's almost no skill matched duel opponents. I tryed playing CA, it helped me to train some mechanics (still have a lot to practice though), but it gets kind of ridiculously stupid when everyone just spams rockets with no clue.

What i am trying to say by this post, is that i'm sure there is a lot of people who is struggling the same problems as me. I want more learn to plays, and I also want to offer you my help with making them. I think it may be hard for you, who play the game for around 10 years, to understand the difficulties which players like me face when they are playing. So consulting with a noob can make it easier to choose content for l2p. Also i think that something like teamliquid practice parnters thread would be awesome.

You can contact me via skype:vic_proon, twitter:@deathToMankind or via smth else.
Thanks for reading. 

P.S.: If you're a beginner like me and agree with what has been said in the post, upvote please so it have more chances to be spotted by thegdstudio."	t5_2ttcw	True

&gt;Paradox Interactive -- a publisher who is getting too old for this -- and Arrowhead Game Studios -- a developer pushed to the edge -- are bringing 80s action movie-inspired game The Showdown Effect to Twitch!

&gt;**WHERE: http://twitch.tv/paradoxinteractive**

&gt;**WHEN: Thursday, March 7, 11AM PST (8PM CET if I am not mistaken)**

&gt;**INFO: http://theshowdowneffect.com/**

&gt;The 2.5D sidescrolling multiplayer combat title, complete with terrible one-liners and over-the-top explosions, features built-in Twitch integration so that anyone running and gunning in-game as their favorite action hero stereotype can stream all the explosive action and guitar riffs with just the simple click of a button. 
 

&gt;But hey -- this is a video game -- we should just show you what it's about, right? Paradox Interactive will host a live stream extravaganza of The Showdown Effect this Thursday, and they'll have special guests The GD Studio with them! Who is The GD Studio you ask? Befitting of a cheesy action movie plot..
 

&gt;Ten years ago, in 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they did not commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortunes. They are... The GD Studio!
 

&gt;The GD Studio will take on Paradox Interactive and Arrowhead Game Studios in a winner-take-all team-based competition, pitting the best of the best against a special forces unit of action hero specialists at Paradox including a team of Paradox producers, the QA team, and Arrowhead Game Studios' own ninja squad. Producer Shams Jorjani and Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt will be moderating the action, barefoot and with glass strewn all over the floor, from atop Paradox Tower. 
 

&gt;Four teams. One survivor. All chaos. Way too many clichés. 
 

&gt;Tune into the Paradox Interactive channel on Twitch this Thursday and watch these teams Face Off and Die Hard as they try to draw First Blood with their Lethal Weapon of choice.

1. Intro the Game &amp; Hosts (2 hosts is a must) - Maybe also show some Game trailer clip as the intro, directly after the GD Studio opening.

2. Play the game naturally for a good hour, so people get the feel of what the game is, without reviewing it. It's important the games are new.

3. End of show, dicuss what we liked, didn't like, also would we play it again? price. etc

And to make the casting even better Adebisi is going to Observe.

It doesn't even matter how the venue is going to look or anything. You could literally paint everything shit brown and it would still be one of the greatest events of 2012. Really looking forward to it!

**Quote, 2GD:** *""China is huge for dota2, right now, because of how League of Legends has grown so strong in China. You want more teams from that region. So the four Chinese teams, although they might not win, it gives them a bigger story if one of them gets far""*

There are some other comments, and it seems Hellspawn knew a bit more about this, but didn't really get his point across.

I'd just like to point out that the Dota1 competitive scene 'is' China and the Philippines.  
Take a look at this [list](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota/rankings). Take a look at [DK's achievements](http://www.dota2wiki.com/wiki/DK)

Dota (1 and 2) has been shown on cable TV in China. ECAL hosted a tournament (dota2) which allegedly reached [1.4 million](http://fucknite.mydrm.net/index.php/news/item/48-ecal-%E2%80%93-14-million-viewers-for-inaugural-dota2-showmatch) combined views across tv/online. Although this number is hard to prove, we at least have [tobi saying](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/ro7pr/ecal_14_million_viewers_for_inaugural_dota2/) he's talked to them and believe the numbers after initially doubting them. Either way, Dota is enormous in China, as a casual game and an eSport. (not to mention the [1.5 million international viewers](http://www.facebook.com/joinDOTA/posts/247700551931398), of which only 300k were the english stream)

To add some more numbers [icefrog saying](http://www.dota-utilities.com/2010/05/icefrog-q-session-4.html) China is 40-50% of the dota playerbase, which would be about 10 million. (speculative, but still gives an idea of what kinds of numbers we're talking about)

And to many, these teams have done enough In Vanilla Dota to deserve an invite to TI2. And I tend to agree with that, because if you ask Na'Vi who they think their biggest competition will be at TI2, they're not going to say a European or American team. Anyone who's followed Dota1 knows how many leagues ahead the Chinese scene is, they're more dominant than the Koreans in SC2.

This isn't just ""valve invites them for marketing purposes,"" these are the best teams and players of all time. And they will bring a much harder fighter to the International than anyone else. The fact that they will also bring viewers/media/players from the region is just a bonus."	t5_2ttcw	True

Karuramon	36	6	13	"I guess he will have prepared stuff himself, but maybe we can come up with something for him, he wants to cover, as well.

Of the top of my head I can think of the following things:

-forcefield placement in different situations(when to hug an army, when to split an army etc.)

-army composition. What should a good deathball consist off against what armies.

-where to put proxy pylons for timing attacks and late game scouting.



If you have more ideas please post them!

edit: please spare as you protoss hate!

AdvisorZero	32	3	12	"Long before time immemorial, before time was even word or concept, Michael ""Adebisi"" Van Driel paced inside his man cave/igloo, looking forward to watch the awesome antics of the lovable Jersey Shore gang, he however was very anxious for the show to start so he turned MTV on before the show had begun. Then something happened, (related to a subject that has gone horribly unmentioned through the years) MTV showed a music video, a video, with a song, of an artist, yes. The song you ask? [The Specials - Nelson Mandela](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgcTvoWjZJU), it was in this precise moment that Mike had a breakthrough, Mandela is not free, then Mandela must be freed! and after this realization, he proclaimed, FREE MANDELA! But how, how was he to do such a thing? A plan had to be formulated, and that plan had to be executed, and so began a grueling hour of brainstorming (i.e.: Jersey Shore's mind effects), until, well until, light shined through the cave's entrance as if [Zeratul](http://i.imgur.com/lMwniV9.jpg) had appeared! What was before unseen was now as clear as his poorly, (monitor light) lit room, ""Starcraft commentary, yes!"" -Mike exclaimed. ""If I become a commentator my voice will be heard, my appeal for Mandela's freedom will be recognized by all listening!""  
___
Time went by and things for Mike shifted, he wanted more exposure, and his commentating career wasn't giving him enough, so he decided to become a dedicated observer, something that would improve the casting of games, and the observing of games, by separating the tasks so both could be done at their best. Such talents were well received, and Adebisi's popularity grew. Ah there it was! a chance to truly break through monitors into people's homes, and share that oh so important message that had lived on, inside his heart, through all that time.  
___

One night, however, Mike watched The International 2, and there he saw in Benaroya Hall a big, shiny classy, stage, that stage could be his stage, the stage for his message. Cameras switched, and James ""2GD"" Harding showed up on camera, ""So James is at The International, James likes Dota 2, has a studio, and they have Apollo"" -he said to himself as if he knew someone could hear him and would write it down months later. Mike foresaw many possibilities, but quickly decided that the best way for him to share his message with the world, was to do it in the stage of The International, which he would be able to, if he were to join The GD Studio, and then tag along with them to Seattle.
___

Time went by and Mike succeeded in joining The GD Studio, however it was during this time that Mike found himself with alcohol and around other alcoholics, and his mind succumbed to it. Mike forgot his true purpose, the memory of the oh so wanted, freedom for Mandela, was covered by layers of thoughts of alcohol desires. Mike was now running the The GD Studio, the only thing his alcohol blood level allowed him to do.
___

Until one day, which by the time this all happened, was lacking sunlight, so one night, the night of May 19, 2013, bartender Mike entertained the house guests, with his alcoholic beverages in to glasses pouring abilities, which consist of hovering an open bottle of an alcoholic beverage at an angle, over an empty glass. Drinks sometimes to be consumed by others, sometimes by himself, what he consumed though is what changed everything, Mike got drunk, which opened his mind to pleasant feelings of floatiness and joy, however Mike felt a bit different, he felt drunk, but slightly calmer and more meditative than usual, something perhaps caused by the type of drinks, amounts, intake speed, present company and his mood. After the qualifiers were over, the party continued and music was played, tracks rolled by and [The Special's Nelson Mandela](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgcTvoWjZJU) came on, Mike realized that this was a familiar song, and familiarity transformed itself into clarity and gave way to a chant ""FREE MANDELA! FREE MANDELA! FREE MANDELA!"" - repeatedly and repeatedly, Mike shouted as he had rediscovered his true purpose in life. 
___

Mike is now headed to Seattle! Jogging and drinking an occasional properly mixed chocolate milk, while maintaining an adequate and pleasant alcohol blood level, he decided that he couldn't wait any longer, not for TI4, not for August to arrive.
For his travels he shall assemble a team, at the moment his sole companion is Bruno, who is supportive of Mike's cause, and looks at this adventure as a big of opportunity to find true love. 
___

&gt;How will Mike jog, all the way to the international? 

&gt;Will he just run on a treadmill set up on a plane? 

&gt;Will he make it in time to try to jump from ice block to ice block and cross the Bering Strait? 

&gt;Will he jog north until he finds a wandering polar bear, proceed to keep on jogging on top of it, controlling it with his feet to cross the Arctic waters, so that he can then travel across the Arctic ice onto another polar bear, onto Canada and then reach Seattle? (will the first bear remain with him as his companion? and if so, even after he reaches Canada?)

&gt;Will he ultimately manage to free Mandela?

&gt;Will he not go for a jog, and instead see if [Mandela's Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela) has been updated?

&gt;Was Mike actually just offering a free, [Mandela DVD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandela_\(1996_film\))?

___  

&gt;Will Bruno find what is yet to be found? 

&gt;Could true love be one big database with everything that Bruno loves?

&gt;Will he protect the cities he finds on the way to Seattle, with his Statman superpowers, and defeat the bad guys on the streets, or at least those who make arguments with statistical errors?

___

&gt;Will Draskyl ever ""fuck him up, kill him, call him noob and call them noobs"" like Mike suggested?

&gt;Will Draskyl not forgive rape by [Adebisi](http://i.imgur.com/MUPT3Fz.jpg) even if that Adebisi is [Mike](http://i.imgur.com/nrgbtwp.jpg)? (NSFW http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cLwFEOMnF4)
___

The future holds many possibilities to behold but to which will the future's eyes focus on? Such things I do not know, but I look forward for developments. (seeing time as linear, so I look forwards to see what comes to be from the sea of posseebilities) 
___



This is based on the events that occurred during Draskyl's stream, like with Adebisi's twin brother [Destiny](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zN3GqNICzw), streams get an added interest when alcohol is involved

You can hear Mike's footsteps approaching from this moment on http://www.twitch.tv/draskyll/b/405800782?t=5926s (go to 1:38:46 http://www.twitch.tv/draskyll/b/405800782 if Twitch has no sound in the other link)

Here you can see the darkness emanating from Bartender Mike's eyes, upon the sight of alcohol, while the alcohol entices him into approaching, by emitting pretty lights. http://i.imgur.com/CYqVbIi.jpg

Here you can see Mike consuming a beverage while sitting next to Greykarn, he chose this place because he found himself reminiscing about his former haircut, after seeing Greykarn's hair. http://i.imgur.com/c95Y4kM.png

1365747062.0	1c6wun	Just a humble GD studio show idea.	AtreSamus	30	2	14	"**Semmler vs The house**


**What is it?**
It’s Semmler taking on someone else in the house in a number of pre decided games. 
However neither Semmler nor the house member will be playing. 


**Who is it?**
Semmler would be the standing recurring combatant since he has a knack for getting his pants in a twist and everyone else seems willing to troll him. Semmler also have a good but not too good knowledge about a wide array of game styles.

 He would be facing off against a house member that everyone in the house except Semmler himself agrees would do well against him. 

 But neither Semmler nor the other house member would be playing. They would have to recruit someone to play for them. 

Now this is where we can go down two different yet interesting roads; 


**A,**
Let them recruit anyone they could get hold of for example pro-gamers. This would give the audience a higher level of game to watch, for esports and all, but that would also be a bit of ”who knows the coolest people”. It would also most likely have to take place ”online”. 


**B,**
Let them recruit someone that does not play computer games well or preferably not at all. Set up half a day to coaching and teaching the new players while streaming and listening in. Do fun quirky interviews etc. Then in the afternoon/evening you let them play eachother in a nice boX that fits most. This would, to an advantage, take place ”offline” in the house. 

 This would serve not only a great entertainment value but also a slightly educational one for viewers who doesnt know how to play that specific game. 

 This also allows Semmler and the challanging house member to be more active by the coaching and lets be honest if they invest personally into the players by coaching and supporting them for a day, hilarity should ensue during the matches, would should be casted by the two coaches. 


A nice and neat bo 5 games/player set ups, or so for Semmler vs The house would be cool. 


**When is it?**
For the B option, which I personally feel would be the most interesting one you would probably need a full day. 
 This ofc needs some work, tweaking and refinement and to get that special GD studio touch and feeling, but its an idea and something that I personally would love to watch. I know and understand that the studio produced content for almost every day of the week already but maybe this can be put on the shelf for when needed. 


**One step further (optional ofc)!**
I would personally also like to see this being taken just one step further and make this a charity event. Let the guest players each choose a charity organisation to donate the days proceedings to if they win the evenings match. 

  It would be awesome if the ad revenue and the 5€ any new subscribers from that specific day would go towards the charity pot. I have no idea what kind of money that would bring but I imagine it wouldnt be much, thus the need for sponsors are great. Sponsors that would be willing to go in and double, tripple, or whatever would be a nice ammount, of the revenue money. 

  Maybe this would be to much work before we know if this format of Semmler vs The house would even work and attract viewers but in the best of worlds..!

1336080356.0	t5qv8	So regarding the L2P DotA 2 today...	koko775775	32	4	18	"I don't know if it was only me, but I thought this was the first GD show that was merely mediocre. 

Maybe it's because I compare it directly to yestedays episode of L2P SC2 with Apollo. But when comparing those two directly I think one can see things that the Dota show could improve on:

**1)** In the SC2 show Apollo was controling the camera, the stream saw where he pointed at, what he ""boxed"" etc. Comparing to DotA it was from James' pov, but what we actually needed was CWM explaining and pointing. I also believe this leads into the second point.

**2)** In the SC2 show Apollo did the big chunk of the talking (the guy who teaches basically), whereas in DotA James did the talking (not the guy who teaches :D, no offense). What I meant by 1) leads into 2) is that when you don't control what the viewer sees, it creates this awkward tension between CWM and James, where CWM has to wait for cues from James what to talk about.

**3)** It didn't really seem that the show had a concrete plan, rather a general idea (it got particularly messy when the 2nd replay couldn't been loaded up). Comparing it to Apollo's show: Apollo basically first showed an average game (points out typical mistakes etc.) and then presents how a game can potentially look like (from a pro POV like Nerchio). I think this could be a good approach for the DotA L2P aswell and it sounded like you guys kinda wanted to do something like that, but then the replay went 'splat'.

**4)** Kinda similar to point 3. I thought the 'titel' and goal of the lesson weren't quite in sync. I mean the titel was ""Jungling"" right? But all we heard was a mix of general and specific tips on how to play Chen. So what I think you should do is: either change the titel and go super indepth with Chen, also covering all the Auras of the creeps, where exactly which creep spawns, Aura Stacking with other heroes etc. OR show some other junglers aswell. For example I'd like to hear how a pro approaches a Lycan, he really isn't that easy to play Jungle with, esp what to buy first, which spawn to creep, to not mess up the start of the game etc.

__________________________________

Other than that, I felt kind of disappointed from what I could take out of this lesson. I didn't really hear anything new, but maybe I just expected too ground-breaking things to be brought up because a real pro was on the show.

So from my perspective, I think the biggest difference between DotA and the SC2 show was that the actual teacher was preparing and leading the show in contrast to the host. Also that Semmler took a more active role as an average player to ask questions/pick from chat to interact with Apollo played a big role.

[BTW, in danger of sounding like a complete douche by this point, but for presenting jungling with Chen I really wished you had either CLG.Akke or Puppey to interview :D. I realise they had games today to prepare for aswell as jetlag from LAN finals, but just as a general thought. I mean if you are going to teach farming with a Carry, pleeease try to get Pajkatt :D]

### DotA 2 / CSGO - The ""Valve"" Leaks Kappa

#### DotA 2 General News

* Information has slowly been pulled out and leaked that Korea DotA 2 is on the uprising. [My Reddit Summary of Situation](http://www.reddit.com/r/thegdstudio/comments/19v026/dota_2_to_korea_news_secerts_and_a_hidden_message/)

* GOMtv - New Teaser Trailer that features DotA 2 in the background. It shows only sc2, WoT(which they are running a league for it soon), and DotA 2. 

* Mr. Chae spoke in interviews with Slasher at IPL5 that they are getting a new studio soon. One of the main reasons is so they can do team games. We all thought it would be like a FPS game or LoL or DotA 2

* But GOMtv already stated they are doing a WoT league (It appears that this league will be invested by the developer because last month the developer said they were putting $2 million in to eSports this year.

* New DotA 2 patch is released - Korean Server [Cyborgmatt's Tweet finding out Korean Servers](https://twitter.com/Cyborgmatt/status/309440225518690306)

* Official Korean DotA 2 Voice/Dubbing Twitter launched [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Dota2KR_Voice)

* One of the first tweets from the account was ""*One of the first tweets is ""DotA 2 Recording this week Tues 05.03 a day has progressed to authentic post from next week'm bringing""

* It appears that DotA2 is going to get totally revamp for the official Korean version. 
________________

* GOM Chung's commets

* First, I'm a mod in OMGtv so I pay attention in chat a lot and try to filter out all the ""fuck slashers"" (lol ya right I don't)

* Kennigit from TL called in during Live on 3 to talk about all the news that came out for DotA2 recently. He thinks that it is a possibility that GOMTV will host a league.

* During this GOM Chung is in the chat talking and seems really happy. GOM Chung is one of the heads for the international side for GOMTV. He is always talking in chat during GSL, and is the one that does all the English posts on gomtv site.

* The chat goes crazy and tells him to call in to the show. Of course he says something like he can't because he is at the GOM office and has no mic.

* Then I asked him in chat ""Is any of this true about DotA 2?"" and then he said ""No Comment""
 
* This is Game (Korean eSports ESPN style company) releases a article [Link Here](http://www.thisisgame.com/board/view.php?id=1469751&amp;category=102)

* My Korean is not the best, and Google Translator is shit but the article talks about all the recent developments that have been coming out with DotA2 and Korea. It talks about how Nexon is working with Valve to get steam or something similar launched for DotA 2 in Korea and talks about how they are testing the servers for the game and steam.

* Article also states how DotA 2 is on Nexon's official calendar for release in the second half of 2013 in Korea.

* EDIT: Looks like somebody on Team Liquid translated a lot of it http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=401866#1

* EDIT2: Seems like the GOMTV staff is all about dota 2 recently. Two of their head employee have been playing a lot  [azsharalife](https://twitter.com/azsharalife) [amator](https://twitter.com/amator)

1343903408.0	xk2fv	The Inhouse GD Studio ASUS ROG Raffle! Prizes!	Highblade	30	5	47	"Hello GD Studio Viewers!

The ASUS ROG Tournament starts today at 14:00 (EEST) and as a bit of fun some of us within the community have decided to run a small raffle whilst the tournament takes place, which may involve some prizes.


**How the Raffle Works**


Since this is only a relatively small raffle and was created from people within the community we thought it would be best to limit the amount of participants to the same amount of players that are actually at the event, which means there are limited entries for the raffle. All you have to do to participate in the raffle is go to this website and sign up using the same name as you use on reddit. This page has been setup so that it randomly assigns you a player that is in the ASUS ROG tournament and he will be your hope in winning. This means only the first 32 people who signup will be in with a chance of winning. So to clarify, if you register on that page and are randomly assigned Liquid'Taeja and he then goes on to win the tournament on Saturday, you have also won first place in the raffle.

SIGN UP AT : http://heynicebeard.com/gdraffle/ 
Although its only the first 32 Sign ups, the order in which you sign up has no direct relation to the seeding of the players.
One entry per person as well, If we suspect you have cheated the system you will be DQ'd.

**Prizes**

The aim of this was to have a bit of fun within the gdstudio community and give someone bragging rights for having selected the right player but I also managed to speak to Trance and he was willing to throw in some extra prizes from QPAD (Sponsor of The GD Studio). *See below*

* First Place - *QPAD MK-85 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard and a Signed QPAD GD Studio Mouse pad*

* Second Place - *Signed QPAD GD Studio Mouse pad*

* Third Place -  *Signed QPAD GD Studio Mouse pad*


**Extra Information**

I've been watching for many many months and I just learned now (googling it) that that Newman co-founded Dignitas, and I realize Dreamhack's team probably just does everything together, but it would be interesting to know where Hellspawn's expertise lies.

""Our audience is pretty sophisticated about watching this online,"" Johnson says when I ask if they'd ever partner with television networks like ESPN to take Dota matches to a national stage. ""If our fans thought it would be cooler, and that's the way they want to watch it,"" then Valve would consider it, Johnson says. But there are no talks in progress.

~

Siva, 19, is modest even for his age. He says he doesn't care about making a large salary or earning big perks—he just wants to get better at the game he loves playing.

But Valve believes that Siva and players like him should be making more money. After all, not everyone can do what they do. Not everyone can bring in the audiences they can.

""The amount of value that these players we've invited are creating for this large audience is immense,"" Johnson had told me earlier. ""And the prize pool doesn't—the winner gets a million dollars... [but] even that, I don't think that that equals out for the value they're creating for so many people.""

Valve has solutions for that, ideas to help compensate players. They imagine that the game will continue to grow and evolve over the next few years, and they hope to bring in more money by selling in-game accessories like team pennants, which fans seem to love.

""The salaries for any sport with that big an audience and few people [who] are [that] good at it-those guys make a lot of money for a reason, cause no one else can do it,"" Johnson said. ""We're thinking a lot about what are the things that we can build into the economy so that these guys— the value they've created is getting actually paired with real dollars.""

**TL;DR: I want to gather newbies and TGS*-Fans in Quake, SC2, BLC and DotA 2 in order to slowly grow a vivid community.**

Hello everybody! After having watched the first episode of the *Learn to play Quake Live* series I was totally fascinated with the immense depth and awesomeness of this game and immediately created a new account (I already tried Quake back in October, but I did not know where to begin at that time). I am really having fun playing and learning, but as for every Online game I think it can become quite monotonous and demotivating if you don't have any regular contacts to play with.

Originally I just wanted to know if anyone else is currently starting to learn Quake and looking for practice partners, but then I came to think that there are possibly beginners in StarCraft II, Bloodline Champions and DotA 2 as well, who got their interest drawn to these games because of *The GD Studio* and are now also looking for fellow players. Maybe - assuming of course that there are enough people interested  - this (or another) post could become one of those typical ""Looking for practice partners"" threads as seen on [teamliquid.net](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=328110) for example.

I love the Studio and really believe in its future, so I think it would be great if we could slowly begin to develop our own little community here. Who knows, perhaps there could even be some *Learn to play* tournaments every once in a while, where newbies compete against newbies to show how much (or how little) they have learned from the show!? I think this could be a nice addition.

What are your thoughts on that?

**TGS = The GD Studio obviously.*

Possibly we could alternate each week 1 serious game one silly.

week 2 monobattles

1363221668.0	1a9531	Full of Steam, feedback and suggestions	Exedar	27	3	20	"Carefull, wall of text incoming ;) I don't really know if this belongs on reddit but since there is not yet a homepage or a forum for the studio I'm just going to post it here anyway.

I think many of you will agree with me when I say that Full of Steam was pretty sub-par this week and didn't yet live up to its full potential either. So here is some (hopefully constructive) criticism and also some suggestions on how you maybe could imrpove the show.

First of all the positive. I really like the idea of Full of Steam that you just sit down, play some games, show us those games and tell us a bit about them. And if you are into those games and you like them then the show is really well done and interesting to watch since the viewers can feel your interest and optimism towards those games.
The show for The Showdown Effect for example was pretty good since you were really into that game and enjoyed playing it and it also was a good game to watch since there was action all the time but it was not repetitive.

Now to the negative part. I think todays (13th March) is a really good example for how the show should not be at all. You didn't really know wich games to play on the show so it seemed you just randomly picked a game (Warframe) you had seen a video or two on youtube and got a betakey for. It was very obvious that neither James nor Skrff had a good idea what the game was all about (except for killing stuff), nor was it well presented since the levels dragged on and on and it was really boring to watch allready after the first 5 minutes of gameplay.
It also was crystal clear that you didn't particularly (as in not at all) cared for the game and you didn't seem to want to come back to it any time soon. So that makes me wonder why you would show such a game in the first place except for the reason that you just randomly selected it. Because if you wanted to review it or present your first impressions on it you really have to do it differently (I know you don't like Totalbiscuit but he does that very well in his WTF is..., he is way better informed about those games and also presents pros and cons for them).
After that you showed some singleplayer and multiplayer for the new Tomb Raider game. Thats ok-ish I guess but not great in my opinion since if you want to find informations or just watch some gameplay for those AAA titles you kind of only have to go to youtube, punch some random letters into the searchbar and you will get flooded with reviews, playthroughs and so on about those games, especialy games as hyped as Tomb Raider.

So my suggestions to improve the show would be:

- Presenting multiplayer PvP games instead of coop games would drastically enhance the show since it does help to make it more interesting (more fast paced action and/or a competitive aspect to the games) and it also fits better with the studios overall theme of esports and competitive multiplayer games

- Only present singleplayer or coop-games you are really into and wich you like to play. Since this show is (as I understood it) just about you guys playing some games and not reviewing or rating them you should play games you enjoy. If you enjoy the games and the viewers really feel that you want to play them rather then just playing the games for the viewers and the shows sake it is not only much more enjoyable for you but it also makes it in my opinion much more enjoyable and intersting for the viewers (since you will automatcially know more about the games and have more to say about them)

- Knowing about the games you play before the show and not reading up on story, publisher, businessmodel (free2play, pay2play, fairness and pay2win etc.) and other stuff on the fly. I can imagine that there might not allways be all that much time to prepare for a casual show like this but just getting at least some informations about those things 15 minutes before the show starts and giving the viewers a rough overwiev before you get into the game would in my opinion improve the quality as well

Since it seems you are sometimes out of ideas for games you could show on Full of Steam I will just suggest one or two games now you could have a look at wich would in my opinion fit really well on the show:

1. Blacklight Retribution;
Free 2 play first person shooter (multiplayer only), several different gamemodes and maps, you can customize your weapons with a wide variety of parts (e.g. choose different muzzles, receivers, magazines, scopes, etc.), some nice unique features like Hyper Reality Vision and Hardsuits (Mechs), customizable armor loadout

2. Star Conflict;
Free 2 play space shooter (multiplayer only, PvP and Coop), open beta, similiar businessmodel to World of Tanks (I know you hate that game but its just the businessmodel, the gameplay is totally different), unlockable ships and equipment are either very similar or identical to the stuff you can buy with real money (you just get earlier access), 3 different ship-classes (interceptor, fighter, frigate), different factions to earn reputation with to unlock equipment, several different maps and gamemodes

Well, this really became a wall of text even though I didn't intend that. I just like the show and wanted to at least give some suggestions and feedback that might improve it. So yeah, I hope other people leave some feedback and suggestions here as well. Other then that, keep up the good work!

TL;DR: none, if you don't want to read you have imo no business on reddit or any forums on the internet for that matter ;)

As you might've noticed, during last MLG we had an inhouse prediction going on between GD Studio members &amp; volunteers. I would like to do this again for Dreamhack Stockholm, but since we don't have an online system yet that allows for just anyone to enter, I'm going to allow in **subs for The GD Studio**.

If you wish to join here is the following that you should do:

* Post a message in this thread saying something like ""Add me in"" this is so I can check your flair
* And then send me a private message on reddit giving me your google account email. This is not so I can spam you pictures of cute kittens, but to give you access to edit your predictions.

Rules:

* I will limit only allow a maximum of 50 people into the predictions, this includes GD Studio Crew, Volunteers and myself. First come first serve.
* If you mess up the document in anyway, be it messing up someone else's score or really fucking it up, you will be DQ'ed and removed from the document.
* At this moment there is no mention of prizes so currently the fight is for honor and whoever can beat out Apollo :D
* There will be announcements in a separate thread mentioning times of when predictions have to be given in

The way points will be given out will be discussed in the spreadsheet itself and the spreadsheet will be open to the public to watch.

I was talking to Trance the other day and we want to have a soundboard for  the shows we run here in general. Apparently Trance gets bored when we're running the shows and he wants to press buttons and make noises! 

Now, we could use online soundboards, but we wouldn't want to have 1000 mediocre sounds for each good one we find, also, it'd be really cool to have soundbites from things that happened in the studio or shit we said in the past.

So the question is: what sounds do you think would be cool to have? Hopefully nothing too cheesy or excessively cartoony, I don't know, in the end, it's you who'll have to bear with this, so it's cool to have your feedback.

Thats right. With the most recent patches, Valve has been pushing custom HUDs into the client and 2 soon to be released with in the next few weeks. This means that what EVER is coming up after the Dire/Radiant HUDs theme will be a HUGE hit. It will be similar to the pennant system or Navi courier. Imagine GD studio interface, Liquid interface, EG etc....

The cost is minimal too. Most teams has already had an overlay system for their players to stream. A tweak here or there would give you a full detail HUD. Valve might release some restrictions later on the art style to fit with the game though.

**Quantic Gaming**

This is a team which always seems to do well, but recently has perhaps not performed to the best of their ability however they seem to be going through some issues as, according to the DotA2 wiki (where most of my information is coming from), they currently only have 4 confirmed players on their roster as Lasthitmagic and Solara were removed from the team after Dreamhack Summer, they then picked up Brax to fill one of their places. However on the positive side they will be able to play with Mikey, who was unable to attend Dreamhack due to travel issues.

So as it stands, and to my knowledge, the Quantic team includes: Korok, Brax, Mikey and PAINTITGOLD as well as a stand-in, although this may not be strictly accurate.

**Statistics**: Won 7/10 of their previous games, including one against Potm Bottom and their overall win-rate is 68% (67-31) and ranked 8^th on Gosugamers.

**POTM Bottom**

This is a team which I know very little about, as they seem to be relatively new for being such a successful team, they won the JoinDota Open III, taking home 500 euros for their team. 

The POTM Bottom roster includes six people (according to GosuGamers) however I would assume that one of them may be a stand-in/replacement although I may be wrong, this is the team: Kizzles, SneyKing, Fogged, Aui_2000, TidesofTime and finally WaytoSexy.

**Statistics**: Won 6/10 of their previous matches. including a loss to Quantic and their overall win-rate is also 68% (17-8) and ranked 16^th on GosuGamers

**Copenhagen Wolves**

This is also a team I don't know very much about, although I would put that down to how late I have come into the DotA2 community as they seem to have been around for quite a long time, judging by the amount of games they have played, over 80 competitive games in total as they were at one-point a team owned by Quantic and have recently broken away from that organisation.

Their roster seems to be more or less stable, and offers no way for me to make a fool of myself (I Hope), the roster is: Calculus, Balsam, S4, Henrydickenson and finally neNo.

**Statistics**: Won 5/10 of their previous ten matches as well as having an overall win-rate of 72% (58-23) as well as being ranked 17^th on GosuGamers.

**Absolute Legends**

This team seems to be one of the better known teams, and the only one among them who has been invited to TI2, they are a predominantly Australian team, with one member from Singapore and one from Canada, so lag may be a contributing factor for their results here, however one of the reasons that they have become so well known is how they would frequently overcome these issues to place well in online tournaments.

AL also have a six player roster and they are: Snoopy, bleek, blackshatan, xMusica, Godot and finally r1sk.

**Statistics**: won 5/10 of the previous games and they have an overall win-rate of 66% (92-48) and ranked 23^rd on GosuGamers.

Thank you if you read all of this, and I apologise in advance for any grammar/spelling errors. Feel free to criticise below, I want to continue doing this and I need help to improve, also if people could post links to community sites for BLC and QL so I can use those in the future. Thanks again

For a example let's say they choose to play dota2. if the GD studio can pick of one game of dota2 in a bo3 against the GD Bteam(Zero) while they are not allowed use wards,antiwards/gem, chicken or boots. they rename their team to the GD Cteam.

Quake Live has been growing in the past 6 months. The GD Studio gave it the first needed kick and FACEIT took over. The number of participants in tournaments has increased (last FACEIT almost hit the registration limit) and Sunday cups gather over 4K viewers regularly now and I don't think it's bad figure for a $125 weekly online tournament. There is still interest in Quake. FACEIT increased the production value and prize money grew across all tourneys. Finally we see some leagues forming instead of just regular tournaments and the pros are returning to the scene (Cooller, Strenx, Av3k). one of the common complaints I've heard about Quake LANs is that always the same players are winning. That is no longer the case. Evil and Dem0n stepped up their game big time and there are other players that can easily cause an upset if they come (Fraze, Baksteen, Sev3n...). Quake is not dead. In fact it's in better shape than it has been in a long time. What I want to say is that Quake scene holds up on it's own but it's very disconnected from the general esport community and DreamHack is the last bridge between them. We must not let it fall. So James please do some magic and bring Quake to DreamHack ;)

1/I feel like a lot of news were under appreciated. Most of the asian dota news are quite ignored simply because none of you have a long enough history with DotA that could appreciate such movement. Some news like the fnatic.NA team requires insight from the NA scene so most of your conclusion are mainly lack of bases. In comparison, you could talk for hours about Slasher getting flamed or destiny vs own3d but cant keep such big news in dota2 for more than 10 mins.

2/Tournament result: I think this is something you simply cant just 'talk about'. There are a lot of contents that you could put on WHILE talking about a final or a play off of a tournament. The highlight function inside dota2 would be put in great use right here. Using those to down/up talk players, creating story line behind teams and their history would GREATLY improve the news. The format could be copied from any sport TV channel.

3/Betting: how about some betting? not money, in game items. Dota2lounge.com offer betting on tournament games. By betting your items you could spice up boring matches, split your staff into team, create stories.... And its also promoting the ingame micro transaction. Not even counting that by looking into the betting ods, its a free survey of the audience on pre-game expectation and fan-favorite.

4/Addressing the reason why you dont have much to talk about. Isnt it mainly because the scene is new and lack of content site? DotAbuff new match making poll(may be interview the guy who made the site), lack of the teamranking chart like teamliquid monthly(?) power ranking (gosugamer is old and outdated). May be even go ahead and do them yourself?

5/Dont forget to ASK for content suggestions. Personally i have a lot of ideas, may be others do too. After each segment do a small plug on where to leave feedback, suggestion etc....

You guys have SO MUCH RESOURCES to do A LOT OF THINGS that make me so jealous :(."	t5_2ttcw	True

If you missed the other post, the site just creepily watches the chat for links and posts them on the site under embedded stream and chat. It's a project mostly for fun which I plan to make available for those interested.  

Anyways, I fixed up so it semi-automatically makes recaps of streaming sessions (I have to go in after the stream is done and enter a title) so all the links can be enjoyed in their glory at the users own leisure.  

You can check out the recaps at [stream.oiroke.se](http://stream.oiroke.se/), and you can watch TheGDStudio stream through my site during The GD Show and most of the airings of Beat the Studio and Full of Steam at [stream.oiroke.se/watch/thegdstudio](http://stream.oiroke.se/watch/thegdstudio).

And if you should be busy; let us know! Tape a camera to skrff's head and have him run after you for a day or something. Not all great content has to be live.

They should look to host a series of events like the recent ACE All-Star weekend (WC3 DotA): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lptQ6_iNJWU&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=1771s

If you don't have time to watch through the video here's some of the things they did:

* 1v1 Hao v Ferrari Techies solo mid
* 2v2 mid SF/SD and Bat/Dirge
* How fast can you clear your jungle, ancient camp, and then kill Roshan
* Both teams can only go to their short lane and first team to push down enemy ancient wins
* 5v5 with support players on carries
* Spoon fed ice cream by cute Chinese girls

Of course there are a bunch of other events that could be run and a restrictions you could have.

Throw in a prized show-match and invite two entertaining teams (mouz, Skanes, NaVi, aL come to mind) and you've got yourself a great event.

**Tuesday** - 

GOMTV releases a teaser for their new Gangnam Studio [Link Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e14eG6g3JhE)

*The video featured some highlights from DotA 2 in the background of some scenes.

*You may ask, ""But what if the editor just put some random B roll footage of DotA 2 in the background?"" I would state that is a possibility BUT the video only features footage from their own events, SC2, World of Tanks (Which GOMTV already announced they are hosting a league in a couple months), and then DotA2.

*I also recall a interview Mr. Chae did with Slasher at IPL5. Where he stated that he wanted to add more leagues for different games to GOMTV. Slasher kept pushing on asking what games, and kept suggesting LoL. But Mr. Chae said ""I can't talk about this""

*One of the reasons stated for moving to the new studio was because it was a lot bigger. Also it makes it possible to host ""team"" games.

*Everybody thought one of the team games only could be like LoL, DotA 2 or like a FPS but it turned out the first ""team game"" announced was their World of Tank league. Which it appears that a lot of the support and funding for this league comes directly from the developer. Since the developer stated last month that they were investing like $2 million or something in eSports.



New DotA 2 patch is released - Korean Server [Link Here](https://twitter.com/Cyborgmatt/status/309440225518690306)

*Cyborgmatt does his usual break down of the patch and finds that a Korean server is planning to be launched

**Wednesday** -

Official Korean DotA 2 Voice/Dubbing Twitter launched [Link Here](https://twitter.com/Dota2KR_Voice)

*One of the first tweets is ""DotA 2 Recording this week Tues 05.03 a day has progressed to authentic post from next week'm bringing""



GOM Chung's commets

*First, I'm a mod in OMGtv so I pay attention in chat a lot and try to filter out all the ""fuck slashers"" (lol ya right I don't)

*Kennigit from TL called in during Live on 3 to talk about all the news that came out for DotA2 recently. He thinks that it is a possibility that GOMTV will host a league.

*During this GOM Chung is in the chat talking and seems really happy. GOM Chung is one of the heads for the international side for GOMTV. He is always talking in chat during GSL, and is the one that does all the English posts on gomtv site.

*The chat goes crazy and tells him to call in to the show. Of course he says something like he can't because he is at the GOM office and has no mic.

*Then I asked him in chat ""Is any of this true about DotA 2?"" and then he said ""No Comment""

**Thursday**

This is Game (Korean eSports ESPN style company) releases a article [Link Here](http://www.thisisgame.com/board/view.php?id=1469751&amp;category=102)

*My Korean is not the best, and Google Translator is shit but the article talks about all the recent developments that have been coming out with DotA2 and Korea. It talks about how Nexon is working with Valve to get steam or something similar launched for DotA 2 in Korea and talks about how they are testing the servers for the game and steam.

*Article also states how DotA 2 is on Nexon's official calendar for release in the second half of 2013 in Korea.

*EDIT: Looks like somebody on Team Liquid translate alot of it http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=401866#1

What does all this mean?
Well who knows. Let just wait and see.

So, this might be pretty a pretty far fetched idea, and I have no idea how you'd go about tracking it, but..

I've recently been thinking that it'd be pretty interesting to somehow track how many times the respective teams stacks the neutral creep camps in the jungle / ancients. 


And then going over the stats post-game as; 

-How many *extra* creep cams were spawned during the game? 

-Which team *stacked the most*?

-Which team were more efficient in utilizing the *extra gold*, or, *how* much of an advantage/disadvantage did they get?

-Perhaps have a leaderboard and check which team is doing the **most** and the *least* neutral creeps stacking. A few months ago now I remember noTidehunter was notorious for stacking ancients a lot, but that has sort of died off as of late. And generally there's not much talk about stacking, I think.

* (From GermanCoastguard) Will you be using the same production team from the finals when you go to spain? They did an amazing job in the finals, except for the downtime. What will you do to minimize downtime at future events? (More GDStudio perhaps?) - Robert / Greykanr.

* (From Imascotsman) Some players mentioned that it is not viable for them to attend dreamhack due to top 4 only prize money. Socke is one i am thinking of. Do you have any response to this concern? - Robert / Greykanr.

* (From Imascotsman) Will the hockey arena be used for dreamhack winter, i feel it created a much better show for the finals and feel the extreme arena is better for pools / groups / semi's etc etc. - Robert / Greykarn.

* (From Choboface) How much money did Riot give Dreamhack to run the LoL tournament? How does it compare to support provided by other developers? - To Robert/ Greykarn

* (From Ortdekk) The games you have in the tournament, what do you feel is missing from them? -Greykarn/Hellspawn(although I don't think Hellspawn will be present)

## To GDStudio Crew

* (From Sirrush) What, if anything, do you feel needs to be improved if the GDCouch makes a return at another event, was there something you were particularly annoyed with? - 2GD/GDstudio Crew

* (From GermanCoastguard) Why dont you put all your stuff on youtube aswell as on Twitch? I guess it is because the studio is heavily involved with Twitch, but more viewers most be a good thing?

* (From svperstar) Will the GD Studio ever work an MLG event? - To 2GD/Trance

* (From Clearest) When will that DayZ review with Female James(or any of The GD crew) be done? - To 2GD and the boys

As you probably know, in the UK the BBC has the rights to show all of the Olympic sports, which they do by having 24 HD (and SD) channels available on Sky (and cable?), as well as every singe sport streamed live on their website.  

Now, if anyone from the UK has looked at these streams you can see just how easy it is to navigate to what you want to watch *even during a livestream*. Basically underneath the progress/time-bar there are headings that display the event and stage of the competition that is in this particular VoD/livestream - easily navigatable while watching a show.  
My idea is for you (as 2GD has said he wants to be the innovator as far as production and streaming goes (also this would be a great addition for all of Twitch really)) to implement this if possible in future streams. Probably just tournaments firstly to see how it is. The idea would be to just have one long VoD with a producer ""marking"" what series is starting at time x, and that at time x on the progress/time-bar, a heading appears telling you what series is played at this point, and clicking it goes directly to it.

**Learn2Play**

I did not watch the BLC content, since I don't really like that  game, so I can't comment on that. The other L2P series are great. I do feel that most of the shows don't really show a good preperation. This was mostly noticeable on the Starcraft 2 L2P, mostly because I know more about that game. 

I think a good help will be to announce a few days before the L2P, what the content of this episode will be. Viewers could send in questions with could be prepared before hand.

Lastly, I have a feeling 2GD is carrying the shows a little too much. The people I know mostly tune in to watch the random banter from him. The shows need to get exciting without 2GD, when he can be there (For example in SC2) it is a nice bonus, but it should not be required.

**The GD Show**

I really liked the first show. But it became pretty clear that not everyone knows as much from every game as the others. Incontrol had to carry the SC2 part while Semler and 2GD had to carry the BLC parts. It would be a more interesting show if you had a conversation about the recent news instead of presenting the news like on television.

NewmaN was not looking really comfortable, but that might just be because it is the first episode. I really like the community driven news. But I disagree with an open Google Docs. This subreddit should be fine. Just make a new thread for the show a few days in advance and collect the news items there. The most upvoted newsitems will rise to the top and that should be the items to get into the show.

I don't know if quests are going to be calling in like on LO3? It might be nice to get some different perspectives from people not present at the studio.

**New show on Monday | Will and Skrff**

I like the idea of an even more casual show. This could be good fun. It would be even more fun if the games are not actually being reviewed (No marks etc.) Just casually play the games and have fun. Maybe even have 1 guest from other shows hop in. 1 Show with dApollo and another one with Semmler for example.

An idea I got from this was the following. A casual game night (After this show) where the hosts play games with  the viewers. This way it doesn't have to interfere with the L2P's and you don't really have to play BLC, Quake, SC2 or Dota2. You could even play some other games like StreetFighter or MVC3 for example. Everyone remembers the days (And might still do) the nights where you are sitting on the couch or had a few computers and played games all night with your friends. It was nothing serious and you just had a great time. I really think this could be fun for viewers to watch, especially if some alcohol is involved.

**Thank You** a lot for doing this. I like every show and it seems to improve everytime. I love that you guys are listening to the community and actually using there input.

----

Hopefull other viewers also have some feedback or good ideas. After this Meeting I guess this is a good place to collect it.

1360252192.0	182hq7	Open Invitation to all GDlings :)	Varzoth	16	5	10	"Hello everyone! 

Recently I've been thinking about how to connect gamers with each other, often communities and friendships are based in and around the games we play. This is great it means people who enjoy the same things can connect; But what about when you stop playing a game? I often loose touch with good friends because they or I move onto other games.

Introducing Motley Crew. Motley Crew is a new multi-gaming clan I'm setting up, the idea is to provide a social hub for gamers were you can connect with other to play anything you want and if you stop playing one game you don't loose touch!  

I decided to post about this here because I love the GD studio guys and all you you are so passionate about gaming. So I'd like to get to know you all better. I hope that all of you will consider joining me on my quest to create a new community of gamers.

You can find the website here: http://motley-crew.enjin.com/home
and the main point download raidcall and join the new group Motley Crew (id:5652891) you can also add me as a contact on there (Varzoth)


Obligatory disclaimer: I'm not looking to make any money out of this and I don't know how I could anyway It's just a sideline passion project :)
Also I chose raidcall because it seems like a great platform for this type of project providing members with a free chat client and VOIP for talking in and outside of games. 

Thank you very much for taking the time to read this and I hope to be playing with you all soon!



Varzoth


EDIT:  Thank you to everyone who has signed up so far! Just a reminder to download Raidcall and hop into our channel that's where I hope all the action will be!  It's totally free to use and very quick and easy to setup I promise. This advert was brought to you by Evil Geniuses LTD ^^

I have an idea, after a stream is concluded you could rename the stream to eg. 'Next show - L2P Starcraft @ XXth XX:XX'. Just a thought as some people who watch the stream may not follow another social medium.

1364152080.0	1axd8w	Dreamhack Invitational - Poll Suggestions	nobpydge	10	0	4	"So I was watching the Dreamhack invitational today, and the polls really didn't seem that interesting anymore because they weren't live. I actually really enjoyed the polls when they were live but now that there is stream delay I realized you cannot use them for the same effect at all. This was a really cool feature and I want it to still see success so I came up with some ideas for it to improve:

1. (Storylines) I think the way the results are presented needs to be changed. Before when it was live you could just show the results develop as the voting occured, but now we just see the results when the voting ends. This doesn't really have any flair, it no longer has that awesome live feeling and it has no relevance. So I think that a good idea would be to use the results to develop the story line of the match or the map and give it relevance. For example, asking which team will win and then showing the results following the map bringing up a point of discussion with the analysts. Having these story lines will obviously help make each match, and personalize the games which is huge for the viewers.
2. (Flow) At times when the voting ended it seemed quite awkward when it was announced that the voting ended, for different reasons that I won't go into. This is mainly due to it ruining the flow of the commentary, so for it to keep the flow I think the color caster should be the one to announce it, not the play by play or one of the analysts. It is their job to chip in, in between points of action, with bursts of information so it seems better if the color caster just drops in with ""the voting has ended now, and we'll take a look at the results later in the game"", or something similar to that.

I think you can apply both the above points to when the polls are initially presented as well. These are just suggestions, and I'm sure the GDstudio will come up with ideas of their own to improve it, but I really want to see this feature find success because of the huge potential it has to change the way we spectate Dota 2 matches, and ESports in general."	t5_2ttcw	True

1364254213.0	1b08q5	My feedback on the broadcast of the Dreamhack Invitational	sheldon__	8	0	14	"Hi there!

You guys really stepped up the game in e-sports broadcasting with the pre-game statistics, team introduction and everything just for that small of a tournament, huge props for that! I think the broadcast of the actual game however is lacking a lot, and some things are really preventing me as a viewer from having a really good experience, as opposed to a just-above-average experience. Here are my points, most of them based on things I observed from your stream:

1. Camera control vs. Commentator talk

You guys are working with Skrffz as an external camera man right? This is a nice idea, but the implementation is not working out at the moment because there is too few synergy between the camera and what the commentator is talking about. I can't say how this comes but I suggest 1. Skrffz to switch his ""target"" a lot more, because I see him looking at one hero for about 20 seconds while other, more interesting stuff is going on. Listening to the commantators and trying to catch their subject on camera, but still switch the target as soon as the next sentence finishes. I also highly suggest Skrffz to wear headphones or earplugs while the game is going on (if he doesn't already do so), in the game between nth &amp; Dignitas he missed a pretty obvious kill just outside of his screen he could have easily caught if he had sound (you could hear Gyro Ult &amp; Skewer).

On the other hand, the commentators should work more with Skrffz' camera! It seems that the commentators are just commentating, and Skrffz is running after you to catch whatever he can and mix this up with aspects he considers relevant. You guys have two screens on the main desk, and although I don't know what you guys are having on them, I suggest one showing Skrffz camera, and one being a second camera for the second commantator, to get some additional information to contribute. Give James or Draskyl or whoever is the main commentator for the specific game Skrffz camera to commentate what is going on, and the second camera to control for the co-caster to get more detailed insight in the game!

This is my biggest point I feel I HAVE to make, because it is really annoying sometimes and just pulls the entire broadcast down.

2. Voice, Language, anything related to that ...

Try to use more ""determined"" language, leave out all the unnecessary ""should be"", ""able to"", ""actually""! (This concerns for anyone but Waga and Bruno). I know this probably sounds really cocky from ""just a spectator"" to demand you to change your style of language, but there is evidence that constant repitition of certain phrases by a person lower the viewer's interest in the subject the person is talking about. 

Second point about that: Try to bring in more enthusiasm! James and Weppas, I am looking at you (not only at you though)!!! :D   One of the reasons people loved to watch TI2 was the enthusiasm brought up by the casters! Even if it is only an little note from a co-commentator, make it sound interesting and relevant! When there is kills happening, raise your voice and generate an atmosphere where the viewer is tied to the action!

This is it, I feel like the implementation of these few things would really improve the quality of your show and easily put it on par with TI2 (not joking), except the atmosphere of course ^^ And if you guys achieve that, Valve would be forced to make TI3 even more awesome, how great would that be?

I hope you guys appreciate the feedback and import some of this into your broadcasts!

1371476350.0	1gij44	The Tale of a Prototype	BracerCrane	8	1	3	"Our story begins in the vast Pampas of Argentina, in a secret government robotics laboratory in the mid-80's. Amidst the Trial of the Juntas, lead by Raul Alfonsin, many secret organisations and projects, that had been kept hidden from the public eye continuing their work, found themselves without funding and without amnesty from their superiors. Such was the fate of the BRRPA - the BioRobotic Research Projects Agency of Argentina, founded during the Pinochet era with a mission of creating disposable spies for sniffing out pockets of resistance among the masses. But alas, without funding and without protection, the Pampas were once again reserved for the Giant Rabbits and Gauchos. Or so they thought.

One cold night, a stranger appeared on the doorsteps of Old Man Carlucci and his wife, who lived on the outskirts of a small village. His tender skin glistening in the moonlight, as he was in the nude, and was immensely disoriented. Carlucci wondered where would a man come from at this hour, since the nearest bar is no less than 30 kilometers from this humble village and no-one can traverse the pampa without any clothes on a wintery night like this. Nevertheless, the old man felt a strong urge that he could not explain to let the stranger in his house. Disregarding his wife's pleas of just locking the door and letting the man be someone else's problem, he guided the man in.

For almost two days straight, the man slept. 

When he woke up, the man spoke. 
    ""Location unknown, company unrecognized, statistical chance of survival: 0.5. Status of BR1: bound by cotton fabric torso garment and lower half garment; presumably immobilized. Broadcasting mayday. mayday. mayday.""
Old Man Carlucci just smiled at the peculiar man, gently stroke his hair and asked ""Bi-er-uno, you said your name was? well, Bruno, you are welcome to stay here until you feel better. Does that suit you?""

BR1 looked at the kind man and felt something odd deep inside himself; as if he felt a feeling he hadn't felt before.

According to him, NASL has been looking into DotA2 for 2013 but they might be reserving a slot for the possibility of Blizzard DotA.

The latest footages we have of blizzard dota date back to the last blizzcon 2 years(?) ago where their heros were riding mounts and towers could run out of ammo? The game were discussed over on Teamliquid dota thread as 'horrid' 'unfinished' and 'developers have no clue what they are doing'. After that it was reported that blizz all star had been completely rebooted around August 2011.

With the current schedule for 2013, one might have guessed that Blizzard DotA will be released together with HotS. The game was targeted to be a custom map inside the sc2 platform and to be distributed via the Arcade custom map system, which has gone through several remade without significant improvements. This also means that unless Blizzard could actually implement the custom map market place system, Blizzard All Stars will be free-to-play(after paying for HotS ofc). However, with the late development of the Diablo3 promised PvP system, one could really question what exactly Blizzard is doing with their time.

1368038952.0	1dy4uu	Ideas for TI3 Qualifier Production.	uw_NB	9	7	8	"I have a few ideas that i think you guys might be interested to test out:

1/ Magnified mini map. Minimap could either be streamed separately on another stream OR could be magnified using the Overlay customization of broadcasting softwares(OBS, xsplit etc...) I think ratio could be 1.2-&gt;1.5 so you could still highlight the movements while not blocking too much of the main field of view. Uping this to a next level, you could implement an instant replay system  so you could analyze the map and draw on it.(may be TI4?)

2/ Make the stream non-english speaking friendly. Just because you guys are the designated english production stream doesnt mean you dont wana attract viewers from different languages. Try to keep the inside jokes low, avoid lengthy commentating and improve play by play. Jokes like Bruno's at TI2 were actually qquite popular among the Chinese scene so keep it up.

3/Prepare contents for pauses in game. May be a disclose interview with players before the games(ask them about strategy etc... what they want to tell fan mid game?) happen, may be poster highlight. Whatever it is, it needs to be prepared and non-repeated, not like BTS where they just play funny videos/VODs over and over again for the last 1 year. This could be key into leveling up production value.

4/ For dreamhack inv. you guys had a team/players hightlight section that was done by skrff. Even though it was good, i think that section could have been executed much better. Rather than just make one to have one, you could just play a video highlight for each team similar to TI2 production before the series start. 1 Step further would be replacing brake contents with live interview, live feed from the players/pubstomps attendees. 

5/ The last broadcast highlight video from Dreamhack Inv. was also too long, i would definitely cut it off way more than just including every single multi kills in every match of every series.

Please take these into your consideration. Cheers and best of luck."	t5_2ttcw	True

**About Gimble and Arn Podcast:**
The Gimble and Arn podcast is a one hour, weekly interview show where we talk with various members of the competitive gaming community (from film directors to musicians to team managers and players).  Our goal is to highlight important individuals in the community, who are often overlooked as well as to bring out the personal stories of these incredible individuals and share them with the community.  From Vile.State’s love of guitar to Torch’s first GSL experience, we focus not only on the game, but also on the people who make the game so enjoyable to watch.



**You can watch on our stream(www.twitch.tv/definitive_esports) from 10PM BST.**"	t5_2ttcw	True

Thank you for hosting TI3 West Qual! As you have heard, Valve released a patch adding 2 more broadcast slots to the lobby. I know that there is a russian caster slot for starladder.tv (v1lat and co.). But it would be very nice if you could invite also VP&gt;Maelstorm to the additional slot. There are a lot of russian-speaking doters who prefer his commentary over v1lat's. Furthermore, he often has pro-players from Virtus.Pro as co-casters, such as ARS-ART, NS or Airman.

Please, consider inviting him, would be nice to listen to him while watching in-game. He has to stream from dotatv now and there is ~5 sec delay between dotatv and his stream due to encoding. There are more than 2k people watching Virtus.Pro TV on twitch."	t5_2ttcw	True

1364186387.0	1aygil	Why I watch DOTA 2	VOldis	19	16	21	"So recently I wrote some really scathing remarks about GD studios's handling of the Dreamhack Invitational, which I completely stand by, but I want to talk in a more general stance about why I feel the way I do. 

I think we are completely indebted to the players for our entertainment. I simply do not think the skill cap and watch-ability of a game determines its success as an esport. I think you need the commitment and multi-year experience that DOTA 1 has brought us to make something like DOTA 2 possible. Even with the thousand of hours and daily full time practice of these players you still have viewers and fans flaming the likes of Black for his original mouseports performance, and likewise for LODA on NTH and XBOXCT on NA'VI despite two TI finals appearances.

So I could only imagine how terrible and un-watchable DOTA 2 would be with a second tier of players taking the main-stage at events, players that currently get crushed by the talent that people mindlessly flame. 

For me when, when I choose to watch, buy a ticket and support a tournament I want to know 1. who is playing and 2. who is casting, in that order. I am of the perspective that without these mulit-year dota pros the casting alone can't provide me enough entertainment to spend the money and take the time to watch DOTA over real sports, or whatever I'm neglecting during the playoffs of a big tournament. Yet despite this reliance on these players and their skill and commitment you constantly see on JD and Reddit a sentiment regarding the lack of professionalism by these individuals, despite the fact they make SO SO SO little money for doing something we get SO SO SO many hours of enjoyment out of. 

I just can't stand by and watch tournaments like JD decide to create team rankings to impose monetary penalties on these guys who are in school or rely on jobs and family to give us the many hours of amazing dota we consume. Many months ago I even wrote a long post on JD suggesting that teams draft an agreement, a union, or some sort of unifying document to make their own rules about participation, communication, and behavior because tournaments obviously weren't treating them as the main attraction, as the source of power for viewers eyes and dollars.  http://forum.gamesports.net/dota/showthread.php?8418-Dota-2-Pros-should-form-a-union

In the current immature state of DOTA there are so few dollars to be made and only so much time on the weekends that I feel like tournaments should be more than willing to wait 30+m for a team to get OUT OF ANOTHER MATCH to join their game. Shit, GD Studio's first series was delayed and messed up due to in-studio technical sound problems, what if this contributed to a later forfeit by one of the teams? 

In short, as a viewer,  I think it is utterly stupid to keep throwing around words like professionalism until these guys get some job-stability and start making $40,000+ a year, enough to make it their lives for the foreseeable future. DOTA and esports is basically a hobby at this point, (for 99% of participants), a moment to fly close to the sun, not of one's life's work.  

If tournaments aren't respectful of these people, flexible with these people, these superstars, dota and esports won't grow. In my mindset, cancelling games is the EXACT opposite of what tournaments should be doing to promoting the community, growth and the support/viewership of the players and teams we want to see. 

I've been drinking for a few hours and I feel like there is more that I missed, but I think this might capture some of the anger I expressed. I will read it again in the morning and maybe clarify and add more. "	t5_2ttcw	True

Nowadays TV Shows(at least in the Netherlands) usually have a webpage that you can open on your tablet that shows extra info about the show going on and where you can vote on people in shows like ""The Voice"".

So why not have a similar thing for Dota 2? I would love to be able to open a page like that on my tablet or second monitor that shows me all kind of live stats about the game, polls and more! Would also be a nice place for sponsors to show some ad banners on.

What do you guys think of this idea? I might be able to create something like this myself, but I'm not a great designer(more of a developer) and I'm not a caster :).

Since the items betting has been quite popular for DotA2, why dont we expand it to a more casual audience who dont have much items to bet? Virtue currency with benefit to channel's subscribers.

Step 3: Make the tournament double elimination, AtoD+WTF mode. Subscriber team(s) got top seed into round 2 or something.

Step 4: Give me a shout out in the grand final.


Note: AtoD is a DotA tournament format where 2 team ban/pick for the other team but themselves.

-WTF is a game mode where 0 manacost, 0 cd for all spells.

Combining these 2 will create some interesting game play and somewhat balance since each team will want to pick the most useless heroes for the other team and ban what they cant use.

You know how hard it is to schedule games. You know that weekends are really busy. And in this case, you knew EXACTLY where Fnatic was, and when their game was going to be over. 

It is one thing to punish a team who doesn't show up, who is missing people, who you can't even get a line of communication with...but this, this is just punishing a team for the conditions and state of competitive games right now. 

It really shows a lack of maturity, respect and logic to suggest that somehow your tournament is much more important than anyone else's that you can't wait an extra 5-10m for a team to get out of another match. 

Really most of all it punishes the viewers. I personally just stayed home to watch dota.  I pay $5 a month and bought an in-game ticket but for some reason you guys think it is better to stand on illogical principle that can't differentiate between whether a team is missing or simply delayed in  another match of another tournament, which you guys should help SUPPORT as members of the dota 2 competitive community. 

You did nothing but hurt the community, your viewers, your subscribers and the integrity of your tournament today. 

You guys were too pussy to deal with players sniping your stream and you are too pussy to to realize and deal with the mistake in your ruler regarding why a team isn't on time, because you are afraid of fanboy morons on forums that like drama more than they actually like watching dota. 

I like your show. Draskyll you are my favorite caster. But man you guys are making me wonder why I give you money. 

*edit it is 6pm est. I am done posting. I am glad we had the opportunity to argue, I think most of you narrow-minded on this issue but appreciate the responses, even if mostly negative. I just wanted to mention that FNatic is by far my least favorite team in EU so in no way were my thoughts related to their loss.  Peace. 

**edit 2 - I thought about it over dinner and decided to cancel my sub. I just can't get over how shitty of a place the DOTA 2 community scene would be if everyone just cancelled games like this. A B03 can last anywhere from 50m to 3.5 hours and tournament organizers should understand that players MUST play in as many as possible to make any money whatsoever.  Instead of punishing viewers and teams you guys should be busy promoting whatever else the other team is playing in and respect and understand the state of the scene.  T

You can't always plan ahead perfectly but you can certainly wait 30m. Today Fnatic thought they were going to be 10m late and they were wrong, by a small measure of time. Big deal. This wasn't laziness. This wasn't them being aloof, uncaring or anything.  **Their match, a BO1 was scheduled 2 HOURS BEFORE THIS MATCH.**  IF GD studio thinks this is a good reason to cancel I don't want to give you my money.

Lots of love. xoxo"	t5_2ttcw	True
