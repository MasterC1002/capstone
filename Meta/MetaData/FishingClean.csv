DoahRat	198	20	26	"If you're fishing the Shenandoah River in the near future (like the next week)...be advised that we're seeing 20-40% of of fish with lesions right now. Jeff Kelble (ShenandoahRiverkeeper) could sure use all the photos and observations you may have from your trips.  Good sharp photos of any fish with issues, along with time of day, where you caught him and the immediate conditions in the area always help.  We're going sampling tomorrow to get some specimens for pathological study to see if this is new or just more of the same issues we've dealt with in the past.  Stay tuned.

1341864061.0	waclh	r/fishing, would there be any interest in a video series on lure building? 	kr3wTraveLeR	149	9	46	"A while back, I wrote a fairly long, several thousand word article on building lures, along with a lot of accompanying visuals and explanations. This has unfortunately become lost to me. Over the last few days, I've been thinking about this lost article, and about my lure building. I was wondering if there would be any interest in a video series on building wood plugs and pouring plastic lures. I've been building wood plugs for about 5 or 6 years now, and could cover any number of topics, from necessary shop tools, to types of woods, painting, finishing, building different style lures, nearly anything. I could also do something similar with plastic baits, which I've been making for about a year and a half now. While most of the stuff I build lures for saltwater fishing, there's no difference when building freshwater lures. What say you r/fishing, would there be any interest in this sort of thing? 


Edit/Update: This has gotten way more feedback than I could have possibly imagined. I xposted this to r/DIY as well, as someone suggested here, so I'll be interested to see their feedback. This is definitely going to be happening. I will start planning out and drawing up some content asap, and hopefully start generating videos and content soon. Thanks everyone for the feedback, I'll make sure to keep you all posted on whats going on. "	t5_2qlu4	True

Anyway, yesterday I dove in a lake in Eastern Oklahoma that I've fished before with only moderate luck. Nothing remarkable. 

I could not believe what I saw under there.

First, while I've never caught anything exceptionally big out of that lake, I saw some MASSIVE fish. I mean, crappie well above 3 lb, LMB above 6-8 lb, even 10 lb, just hefty fish. Cats in excess of 3 ft. And these weren't rare sightings. I saw 10 bass of that size over the course of 30 min. There were many, many fingerling bass and many lunkers, but almost no fish in between.  Not sure what to make of that. The big crappie were always in pairs or groups. The same was usually the case for the big bass. Groups of 2-4 fish were standard for both species. 

Second, fish were not relegated to certain depth zones. There were LMB, crappie, and sunnies everywhere from 10 feet to 70. Structure that I would normally target (submerged trees) weren't well populated. What WAS well populated were rock crevices, i.e. places where the boulders were split open. I don't have a boat and never have owned one, so I don't know whether or not depth finders can discern that sort of thing. The crevices I mean were probably 8 inches wide, just long narrow cracks in the rockwork. BTW, these were submerged cliff faces. The slope was not gradual. We're always told to fish cliffs and dropoffs, and that seemed to hold in this case. 

Third, when I found a school of sunfish, there were always big fish nearby. LMB, big crappie, and big cats were never far. This wasn't a surprise, I guess. I might try targeting small sunnies next time, and once I've found a big school, then throw in the big lures.



Anyway, I know there aren't any big revelations here, but honestly I was just dumbstruck by the size of the fish down there. If anyone has the chance to dive their local fishing hole, I strongly encourage you to try it. It's very eye opening. 

TLDR; there are probably bigger fish (and more of them) down there than you think. don't give up the chase!"	t5_2qlu4	True

On Saturday evening the manager came down and asked how many customers he had served today. The boy said he had helped one customer. The director was disappointed with the boy and said he already had sellers today who had done much better than him. The manager asked the boy how much the sale was worth, and the boy answered ""$93,100.25"". The manager was very confused and asked the boy what he had sold.

The boy: ""I started off with a $0.25 fish hook which got him looking at the fishing poles. I set him up with the $100 bait master and asked him where he was gonna fish, I told him about that great lake down south but told him he'd need a car with all wheel drive to make it up the rough terrain so we got him into the $33,000 SUV we had on the lot, when he asked about boat rentals I thought I had lost him, but I ended up selling him the $60,000 riverking pro to top it off.""

The manager steps back in disbelief and says ""Wow, you sold that all to a guy who came in for a fish hook?

""No"" the boy said ""The customer came in and told he had to buy tampons for his wife. I simply told him the weekend was already wrecked so he might as well go on a fishing trip""
