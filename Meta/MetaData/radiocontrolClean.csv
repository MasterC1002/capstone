1360197172.0	1817x2	Getting started in RC for under $300 - Hobby King shopping list i made for a friend.	bbzed	40	4	25	"Specifically RC Planes but most of this applies to Helis and Quads as well.

I recently put together a shopping list from Hobby King for my friend which came to roughly $280 for everything he needs, including transmitter, receiver, charger, plane, battery and other miscellany.

I thought other people might find it helpful as it can be a bit overwhelming for people new to the hobby so Ill put it here for reference.

* Ive listed things from AUS warehouse but they are probably available from all the local warehouses. To change warehouse source click International warehouse under where it says AUS warehouse. It will then tell you if it is available locally.
* Some of these items like battery and propellers apply to the chosen plane, but most can be used for whatever you get.
* Transmitter modes: I know most people in America use Mode 2 and most people in Australia and Asia use Mode 1. Im not sure about Europe. There is a link below explaining the differences.

Things you should get from the Hong Kong(International) Warehouse:

* OrangeRX T-Six Transmitter [Mode 1](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=28493&amp;aff=40369) [Mode 2](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=28494&amp;aff=40369) 
* [Sim cable](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=24613&amp;aff=40369) - The sim cable lets you use sims ""sourced"" for free with your own transmitter and receiver.
* [OrangeRX 6Channel Reciever](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=28554&amp;aff=40369) for sim (cheaper, larger, heavier)
* [OrangeRX 4Channel Reciever](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=11972&amp;aff=40369) for plane(more expensive, lighter, 4channel)

Non essentials but handy to have and cheap to throw into an order:

* [Low voltage warning for batteries in flight](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=18987&amp;aff=40369)
* [Stick on Velcro](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=9374&amp;aff=40369) for mounting batteries and whatnot
* [Transmitter strap](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=11982&amp;aff=40369)
* [Prop balancer](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=14927&amp;aff=40369)
* [Fancy red Tx Sticks](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=23762&amp;aff=40369)
[Other stick colors available here](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/RC_PRODUCT_SEARCH.asp?strSearch=futaba+sticks&amp;x=0&amp;y=0)(these are to suite the above transmitter): 

1gram under next postage bracket.

Total $132.74 posted

Everything is in stock ATM.


And from the AUS warehouse: 

* [The AXN](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=21128&amp;aff=40369) - The AXN is a good resilient trainer that people also use as an FPV platform.
* [Charger](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=30711&amp;aff=40369) (which is currently out of stock in AUS)
* [Nano- Tech Battery](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=25214&amp;aff=40369) - These are supposedly of greater build quality and will allow you to charge up faster.
* [Zippy battery](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=16756&amp;aff=40369)  - These are more run of the mill and are quite a bit cheaper.
* [Lipo voltage tester](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=27878&amp;aff=40369)


Roughly $150 posted 


Some other non essentials from AUS warehouse

* [Prop adapter](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=30284&amp;aff=40369) which works better than the stock one
* [Different size prop](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=32067&amp;aff=40369) that gives more power(id get at least 2)
* [Spare servos](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=23996&amp;aff=40369)(id get 2-4)
* [Slingshot plane](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=32505&amp;aff=40369)  Good, fun, $2

Other things you will want but not necessarily from Hobby King:

* [5 min epoxy glue](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=8684&amp;aff=40369) - for quick repairs
* [Rechargeable AA batteries](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=25023&amp;aff=40369) x4 and charger to suite to power the transmitter.
* Some strong tape for use in repairs and hinges.[ Glass fiber tape](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=5719&amp;aff=40369) is good, but clear packing tape works as well.
* A sharp [hobby knife](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=9335&amp;aff=40369). and blades.

1340853894.0	vq0fl	YSK: MaxAmps is the Monster Cable of the RC battery world - they're a ripoff, their stats are lies, and they sue anybody who tries to point this out.	Not_relevant_XKCD	32	4	8	"It's been common knowledge for years that MaxAmps is a ripoff.  Their batteries are perhaps 5% better than generics, yet cost 400% more.  Their ""lifetime warranty"" is only good for one year - ofter that you have to pay 50% of the cost of the pack to have it replaced, which is still more than a comparable pack from anybody else.

What isn't as well known is just how underhandedly litigious they are.  The reason you never see any reviews for their batteries that aren't glowingly positive is that they threaten to sue anybody who posts one.  I'm not just talking negative reviews - anything that doesn't claim ""Max Amps are the absolute best!"" is censored.  Their name itself is banned on several RC forums because of their legal threats.  They regularly have youtube videos pulled with false DMCA takedown notices - their claim is that anybody who says or types their name without permission is violating their trademark.

Check out [this review](http://www.ultimaterc.com/forums/showthread.php?t=139612&amp;highlight=150c).  It's not exactly negative, but apparently it wasn't positive enough for MaxAmps, because they had the video taken down and forced the forum owner to censor their name.  Read some of the absurdities a MaxAmps rep posted in the thread attempting to justify it.

Here are a few.	theony	30	5	4	"[A dragonfly, with 4 wings and an flap amplitude adjuster on the front wing.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K6y1iam7nw)

[A seagull with a pseudo-articulated wing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsiDW_2_RMk)

[A nightfury from How to Train Your Dragon.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ31EYS8jak)

[He's currently experimenting with articulated wings.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atk0UYZ82z0)

My favourite: [a flaptter (!!) from Laputa: Castle in the Sky.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJwIhnFxuWQ) 

You can find more of his works in the [RCGroups ornithopter sub-forums](http://www.rcgroups.com/ornithopters-101/) where he regularly puts up new videos of gorgeous flapping RC models. 

Now imagine if this guy had the kind of resources Festo has. "	t5_2qmhb	True

I'm the Creative Producer of a Kids' TV show, and that show is going to feature some remote controlled vehicles.   So, I'm looking for some RC builders and drivers - good car drivers and at least one stellar helicopter flier - to build some vehicles and come work on the shoot.  Work is being done in the Toronto area so only message if you live here - it's Canadian Children's TV - so we don't have the budget to consider anyone who doesn't live here. 

Please respond if you think you'd be interested - or comment if you know of any good resources I can check out.   

And please upvote so I can get the word out to RC enthusiasts to actually make a little money doing what they love!

EDIT: Not sure why I'm getting downvotes.  It's totally legit, and I figured Reddit would be a good place to get the word out.  Sorry if it sounds like an ad or something..."	t5_2qmhb	True

The plane was held in place by two jack stands in front of the rear elevators. I went to hand start the engine with a chicken stick so i wouldn't put my fingers in the prop. What I didn't notice was that the plane had rolled back from the jack stands. When the engine started, it rolled forward, right into my hand. The 11 inch plastic APC prop got me good in three fingers.

I ended up in the ER, and had to have 13 stitches. Lucky for me, I only broke 1 finger at the tip.

She can be built with a solid, semi solid or the more classic built-up type wing. It's a fully manual build, you'll be cutting out and sanding down all the parts - not to worry, **excellent** build instructions are freely available.

Example build: 

* [Click](http://f3k.nl/tl_files/Mimi/mimi%20Hall%20of%20Fame/saddlesore-1.jpg)

* [Click](http://f3k.nl/tl_files/Mimi/MIMI4.jpg)

Youtube videos:

* [MiMi at the beach](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9dtEmud4oI)

* [MiMi at the park](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfpOSnTcQAk)

[Drawings and build plans are freely available at f3k.nl](http://f3k.nl/index.php?id=3). You'll find a complete photographic build instruction as well as directions where to get the build plans in PDF.

The build requirements are fairly minimal:

* ~20$ worth of balsa and plywood

* a carbon tailboom 

* other materials (pore filler, glass coating, foil, glue)

* double HXT500 servos (or equivalent)

* small reciever

* small battery pack (1s 200 mAh LiPO, perhaps 4 cells cut form a 9V block)

Fairly massive topics exist:

* [RC-Groups.com](http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=840763)

* [Modelbouwforum.nl](http://www.modelbouwforum.nl/forums/hlg-dlg/28435-mimi-dlg.html)

Some hours will go into building this tiny glider, I'm roughly halfway into the build myself and have been enjoying this project quite a bit.

My father got me a WowWee Flytech Dragonfly for Christmas before I went off to college because he thought I would enjoy flying it around campus. My S107 is the only new RC vehicle I've had since.

Lesson learned on this build.  These motors have a tiny set screw that secures the motor case to it's base.  USE THREAD LOCK ON THEM!  I had a motor come off in flight yesterday.  Fortunately, nothing broken but the loose motor twisted itself around to the point that I had to re-solder the connections.  Otherwise, it's flying great.

1342617994.0	wramk	Some Thoughts on the 130X		17	0	14	"Despite the number of forum posts which most sane people would ignore, I recently purchased a Blade 130X heli.

First things first, you are beta testing right now.  There are known issues, unknown issues, inconsistent issues, and surprises.

When I took mine out of the box, the first thing I did was check the gear mesh.  This is a MUST, because if it's too tight you'll be eating A gears for breakfast.  Mine was too tight out of the box.  I pulled the tail boom out maybe 1mm, and now the gear mesh is nice and smooth, if not a bit to loose.

Then, I hit my first real issue... The heli wouldn't bind to my brand new DX8.  All the instructions say is that if it won't bind then you are too close to the heli and need to be at least 6 ft away from it when first binding.  I tried 3 ft, 6 ft, 15 ft, no luck.  I got my break when a helpful forum member suggested sticking the antenna right between the skids and binding that way.  Well, with my TX less than a centimeter from the heli, it bound right away.  So keep in mind, the problems are inconsistent, and you have to try everything even if it means blatant disregard for the manual.

Finally, I decided to fly it.  Horrible tail resonance at low throttle, if you pretty much jump to half throttle right away you won't even notice.  Supposedly this is due to crappy bearings in the tail box (I have some replacements on the way).  Really, the whole tail mechanism is shit, you can feel the slop.  But it's functional, and performs far better than the mCP-X tail.  That said, once there's an MH upgrade part, I'm buying it.

Once I got past the tail resonance and popped it into the air though, all I can say is WOW.  It's stability feels on par with my FBL 450, and the power is there.  Unlike the mCP-X I don't feel like I'll bog the rotor trying to fly into wind, or blow out the tail trying to fly with it (I had a habit of flying my mCP-X in 10-20 mph wind).  I did a horribly managed flip with no issue.  This heli just feels really really great in the air.  I know it'll be getting a lot of air time once I get my parallel charging board.

Only 2 packs so far, but no black dust.  I think gear mesh is the secret to a long lasting A gear, but I'll report back if it does end up wearing down.

If you're willing to deal with random potential problems as the bugs get ironed out, I'd say buy this heli.  It's a blast when it works.  If not, wait a couple of months for an upgraded tail slider, and I think this will be one of the best micros we've ever seen.


EDIT:  Took it to a large field where I could really open up.  I'm no 3D flyer but this thing loves FFF, flips, loops, etc.  Just as fun as my 450 Pro, although slightly less powerful.

Many, many years ago, my Dad used to build RC cars - he's the one that got me into the hobby way back in the day.  Eventually, I started to build some of my own cars, and the cars he built got shelved.

A little over a year ago, I was visiting my parents and came across some of my Dad's collection in the garage.  The cars sat idle on a shelf for about 10 years.  The 3 cars of his that I found were:

* Team Associated RC10 (Edinger era) -- the one in this post
* Kyosho Optima Mid
* Tamiya Toyota Celica Gr.B

I decided to bring them home with me and try to restore them.  This is a picture documentary of the first of the projects.  It's not perfect, and some of the ""original"" parts are missing.  I did my best to try to keep this as close to the car that he built as possible - I only replaced parts that I felt needed to be replaced.  Sure, I could have gone to eBay and bought one of these in fairly good condition, but tracking down all of the parts, tearing it down, and building it back up was totally worth the effort - I can still say that this is *his* car.

After starting the project a little over a year ago and working on it in my spare time, it's finally just about complete.  The only things that I really need to do still are wire up the speed controller, mount the rest of the electronics, and paint the replacement shell that I bought for it.

I plan on giving this to my Dad for his birthday this year.  Hopefully he'll get to enjoy it once again."	t5_2qmhb	True

Nokarm	16	0	6	"Over the last year, I've had a few HPI electronics fail me, the transmitter, the receiver, the ESC and even the servo. And while that is certainly a pain, the rest of the truck is fantastic. I emailed support for most of these things and they sent replacements out pretty quick, although they certainly skimped on shipping, it takes 2 1/2 weeks usually to arrive.


Here's what is great (and terrible) at the same time about them.

They always get it so wrong, but so right.

When my receiver died, they sent two full Tx/Rx sets out.

When my SF-20W servo died, they sent me a SF-50 Metal Gear.

When the ESC stopped responding, they sent me both the replacement ESC AND a new 15T motor.

So far, I love HPI.

I decided to stop being a lurker of the rc world and build my first quadcopter. 

I want to build the frame myself but I created a small shopping list. (I am trying to start a bit on the cheap side because I know i WILL break something :p)

Here is what i am getting

I am not getting a battery from HK because I live abroad and Importing batteries here will get my order stuck on Federal Police for a long time.

I tried reading a lot about what sort of ESC to get for the motors and things like that, I am not sure I am getting the right ones.

I have seen a lot of people using some sort of pointer on the prop to connect it to the shaft of the motor, is that absolutely necessary? 

In the end I am loking for tips and an indication that I am in the right path. So guys, do you have any tips or  stories to share with a new comer?

I couldn't get stable flight again, which was odd, and it descended behind houses some distance away even though I had it at full throttle.  Walked around where I thought it might have landed but couldn't see a thing.  Sigh.  Might drop some leaflets in letterboxes around that area.


I know it wasn't a fancy quadrotor but in many years of R/C it's the first actual disappearance I've had, every other loss has been a spectacular crash.  This probably was too but I don't have the wreckage.  


It's probably on someone's roof or in a tree.

I went alone to fly FPV ( dont ever do this ) 
I underestimated the fact that I was flying partially over some very dense brush once I moved out more than 50 feet , my objective was to get high as possible or as high as I had been to date ( only just getting started in FPV)

I was flying with a Spektrum radio ( DX7) 
My video Stream was on 1.3 Ghz . 

After I flew 2 successful FPV flights and I had some great video on the Gopro I decided to go up one more time , while I was going up I had a Spektrum ""brown out""  The quad lost power for a second or 2 then came  back on but I could not recover .

Rather than rip the goggles off and try and see where the quad was crashing I watched through the goggles as I came down and crashed making every attempt to save it but it crashed into the bush and the picture went dark. 

I took the goggles off and was like where the f*ck it my aircraft . 

Panic set in and I then went on a 8 hour odyssey of bushwacking and snakes and bees . 

I didnt find anything . And my legs are all cut up from the bramble bushes and the thorns and I was stung by a bee.

Just sharing my experience nothing more . 

Please dont laugh I know what I did wrong Shit happens .

All the important bits survived and the airframe cost me $2 and about an hour of my time. 

I made the airframe from two sheets of dollar tree foam board. The instructions and plans are [here](http://www.scratchrc.com/RC-Jets-Flying%20Wings.html). The parts I used were a 30a hobbywing programmable esc from [www.rctimer.com](http://www.rctimer.com/index.php?gOo=goods_details.dwt&amp;goodsid=146&amp;productname=) but [this one](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=2164) and [this one](http://www.hobbypartz.com/07e04-proton-30a.html) are pretty much the same thing. [A programming card](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__2169__TURNIGY_BESC_Programming_Card.html) can come in handy. There are a bunch of different brands that all work  the same even though they are branded differently. I used [this motor](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=23615) and [this receiver](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__11965__OrangeRx_R610_Spektrum_DSM2_6Ch_2_4Ghz_Receiver_w_Sat_Port_.html). [These](http://www.hobbypartz.com/servo-mg90s.html) are the servos I used. I also bought carbon fiber hollow tubes for about $5 each from my LHS and a few Dubro horns and clevises. Hot glue to put it all together. Oh yeah I used a [2200 mah 3s battery](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=14962). 
I expect my rebuild of the frame will take me about another hour. 

Flew fantastic today, I just lost orientation when I was distracted by a dog and pulled up inverted. I don't think I am going to be paying for factory airframes much anymore. This was super easy to make and flew quite well after a little tweaking of the COG.

1326159017.0	oa572	A safety reminder to all you heli pilots!		15	2	9	"After a crash, **always** take apart your cyclic servos and physically look at the gears for missing teeth!

I recently [crashed](http://www.reddit.com/r/radiocontrol/comments/npn74/botched_an_auto_on_my_3d_frenzy_50_size_heli/).  I tested my electronics electronically.  I moved my cyclic stick through its whole range, while applying pressure, and all seemed well.  I decided to open up my servos just to be sure, and one of them was missing a few teeth.  I never would've known without opening it up, and it might've flown fine for a while before getting stuck in that range of non-operation.


I know on some helis this can be a pain, taking anywhere from 30-60 minutes, but it could easily save you $$$, and in a worst case scenario it could save your life."	t5_2qmhb	True
1324840349.0	nqda9	I got a Blade MCX2 for christmas, my first RC toy.	droidrage	14	1	24	"I [posted about a month ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/radiocontrol/comments/mwmnh/good_beginner_rc_heli/) looking for recommendations on an RC heli for a beginner and this subreddit came through in an awesome way.  I've gotten to fly the thing for 2 batteries worth of time so far.  

The first one I mainly spent lifting it off the ground and messing with the trim options.  By the end of the first battery I pretty much had it so it wasn't pulling to any one side very much w/o me telling it to.

The 2nd battery I actually had a great flight with it in the living room where I lifted it off the floor, flew it about 6-8 feet away, then flew it back towards me and landed it (almost gracefully too!)  The heli has smacked into things a couple times but I've so far been great about killing the rotors right before it does and it's holding up like a champ!

Anyway, TONS of fun, thanks for the suggestions everyone that came through with!  I can see myself getting addicted to this hobby very easily.  The biggest skill I need to learn right now is actually learning ""heli left"" and ""heli right"" quicker... man does it take some mental gymnastics to turn the heli the correct way.  I'm sure with practice it'll become second nature though."	t5_2qmhb	True

[This morning's flight to show it hovering with some limited movement.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV5-hPdfiDE&amp;feature=youtu.be). Originally this was an H-quad ([build video](http://youtu.be/oOce5f0Nbic))

It took a few days of messing with the mixer settings. A lot of the instability in the start was due to the fact that the recommendations online for v-tail in the KK2 had settings that only used the front motors for side to side movement, and the rears for turning. I found that I need to use all the motors for all actions, similar to what a quad would normally do. Otherwise it would have side to side shakes, and the turning radius was similar to a semi-truck. 

The way it turns might not be immediately apparent, but the rear basically swivels around, with the front being the central point that it turns around. With a standard quad, the entire craft turns with the central point being the center of the craft. This will make it really nice for FPV as the camera won't be moving when I turn, it will be more natural, like looking to your left and right. I appear to have lost 1-3 minutes of flight time with the V-tail setup. I'm down to 12 minutes on a 2650 4S. I've been able to do 14 with the H-quad. Anything over 10 minutes is gravy :) It weights 830g. Battery adds another 280g. Not bad for something with 18"" long arms."	t5_2qmhb	True

The original motors and ESCs I received from hobbyking were such garbage I ended up going to  my local hobby shop and upgrading everything but the board. I will list my config below, but the issue at hand is stable flight.

Each time I have attempted to lift this thing off the ground, it lifts one motor, flies toward the operator, and loses (at a minimum) a prop. It has gotten to the point now that I cannot test fly again until I get a new bolt (lost in the grass). I have tested all gyro compensations, directions and intensities, but to no avail. Does anyone have any ideas of how to prevent wasting still more money on this brick?
