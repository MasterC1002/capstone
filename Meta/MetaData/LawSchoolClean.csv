1367091288.0	1d8bpm	I Just passed the Ohio Bar Exam with a lot of room to spare. I studied full time, but didn't put in near the time I've seen suggested some places. Here's what I did, hopefully it helps someone.	PassedOhioBar	147	16	39	"Hi all,

I just passed the February 2013 Ohio Bar exam, and I wanted to post the process I went through in preparing in the event it helps someone out there.

As for scores on the exam, I got 92nd percentile with a weighted score of 483.104 (In Ohio, you need 405 to pass).

The Breakdown of that score:

MBE- 154 Raw, scaled to 163.7 (89th Percentile).

Written Score of 76.5 Raw, which scaled to 159.702 (94th Percentile).

The written score includes MPT scores of 5 and 6 (raw, unweighted).

I'm not posting this to brag, I'm posting this to show that someone can essentially crush the bar exam without putting in the absurd time that some programs recommend you put into it.

To me, the worst thing about studying for the bar was not knowing how I should be allocating my time.

Sure, BarBri gives you a ""paced program"" to follow as a model.... but most would agree that the program is insane, and borderline impossible to complete.  I didn't mind the idea of over-preparing, but as a father and husband I simply didn't have 80 hours a week to throw at bar exam prep. More importantly, I found that many of the assignments on the BarBri paced program were a complete waste of time for me and therefore counterproductive if they are taking away from time that could be better used.

When I searched the web I found several other study programs that seemed a little absurd as well. For example, many people seem to suggest that you should complete about 2500 multiple choice questions to pass. Doing the math, that's 75 hours of multiple choice questions. Furthermore, that 75 hours would account only for reading and answering the questions, so add in another 20-30 hours reviewing the answers. This seemed like major overkill on practice questions to me as well.

That said, I thought I would share what worked for me, in the event a future bar taker is searching for strategies like I was at the beginning of my exam prep.

Here's what I did:

- I studied for approximately 40 hours a week. For the most part I took the weekends off. When I did study on the weekends it was brief... maybe an hour or two or a set of multiple choice questions, and even then it was only when I ""felt"" like it. I never did anything that approximated a full day of studying on a weekend day. However, I did stick to studying 8 hours  every weekday with minimal slacking off during that time. Essentially, I treated bar prep as a full time job with no overtime. I didn't take any weekdays off.
 
- I studied for 9 weeks, consisting of the 1 week BarBri MBE preview and 8 weeks of actual BarBri course.

- During the first month of BarBri when you are scheduled to receive lectures I would watch the lecture every morning. One way to make them go faster is to download the lectures and play them at 1.5x speed. You miss nothing from the class and can save an hour+ a day this way. There's other places online where you can find info on this.

- During the lectures I would fill out the lecture notes. I think this is important for keeping you focused and understanding how the rules fit together.

- Every afternoon I would spend about 3-4 hours making flash cards from the morning's lecture. Simply put, I would take every rule given to us in the lecture and put it on a notecard. Yes, this was a lot of work, but this was the place where I learned the rules. I found after completing this process daily that the material was 70-80% in my head and understood. Regarding flashcards... It's important to note that flashcards were always the best memory device for me in law school. I rarely made an effective outline for any law school class... usually I would try and get an outline from someone else and make cards from those... However, if you are an outline maker you may rather use these 3-4 hours a day making an outline and reviewing it... Some people like to make little condensed outlines that put the rules on a few pages. If that works for you, I recommend you use your time to do that. The important thing is that you do something to process the information and learn it rather than assume you learned it because you sat through the lecture. This was a major complaint I had with the BarBri program. If you follow their schedule they would tell you watch the lecture, review quickly then just take a bunch of practice questions. It never made sense to me- why should I be writing out answers to essay questions if I haven't learned the law first? To me, taking the time to process the information is the key to success on the bar, and is far more important than knocking out practice questions to hit some arbitrary number.

- After completing notecards, IF I felt like it and IF I wasn't burned out I would complete a small set of multiple choice questions or perhaps do a 30 minute essay. Most of the time I didn't actually write out the essay, I would read the question, jot out an outline of what I thought the answer would be, and then read the model answer to check to see how I did vs. the model.

- In the last few weeks of BarBri the lectures end. When there were no more lectures I would sit down and go through flash cards, going through a subject at a time. I would go through a subject and make a pile of right and wrong answers. I would go through the stack until I got every card in the subject right. I would do as many of these as I could in about 6 hours.  With my remaining two hours of study a day I would sometimes knock out a set of  multiple choice questions and sometimes do an essay question or two as described above. I did this every day remaining until the test.

- The only exceptions to the above study schedule were when I took the major exams offered in BarBri, such as the the several BarBri simulated half and full MBEs.

- All told, I only completed 12 full-on 30 minute essays under timed conditions. These were the 6 essays that BarBri graded, as well as a ""simulated bar exam"" that BarBri gave you to simulate what a real morning of essay exams felt like. All told this amounts to a mere 6 hours of practice essays. The way I see it, doing practice exams is all about getting used to the timing. Once you have timing there isn't much value in practicing when you could be learning the law.

- All told, I completed about 600-700 MBE practice questions. This includes the 185 or so you take during the MBE Preview week, the 200 you take for the practice BarBri MBE, and the 100 question BarBri Final. I only used BarBri questions and no other questions to supplement (PMBR, purchasing released questions, etc.)

- I only completed 2 full MPTs before the exam. Since I had some concern about the MPT, I outlined an additional 2-3 MPTs (without actually writing out the answer). The MPT is a pure timing exercise only, once you have that down don't waste any more time on it. If I remember correctly BarBri would have had you doing 8 or 9 of these. That would have been another 10 or so hours wasted in my opinion.

- I did not complete the BarBri AMP modules. I tried to at first, but I found they were frustrating when I was taking an AMP module on questions I hadn't yet learned in lecture. Asking me obscure property questions (and those amp module questions can get really obscure) when I haven't even had the lecture yet seemed like a waste to me.

- The bar exam started on a Tuesday. I didn't do a great deal of review after the preceding Friday. I did a little bit on the last weekend but by then I knew everything, so I was basically refreshing my memory so I didn't forget it. The few minor rules I hadn't yet figured out yet weren't going to get learned at that point, anyways. 

- I did not use my Conviser mini review or large course outline books at all. The only books I used were the completed lecture handout sheets, and then the books with practice questions in them. 

So that is what worked for me. Boiling all of this down, my advice to everyone is

- Do your best to learn every rule covered in the lectures, and don't waste your time learning stuff that's not covered. You will be tested on a thing or two that's not covered, and that's OK. Don't sweat it. If you know what's in the lecture you will pass by a mile.

- Even trying your best to memorize just material in the lecture notes, there will be some rules that you just never get. It's OK. Don't sweat it. If you are studying the lecture notes the material you do retain will far outweigh the few things you don't get.

- Take practice tests, but only to the extent you need to to learn timing or feel familiar. 

One final caveat-
Don't sweat the BarBri Scores, either. On the BarBri MBE 100 question final I only got 62 right. The materials said 59 was the average. This made me feel like I shouldn't feel so confident. Furthermore, I scored in the 85th percentile on the midterm full MBE earlier on in the course, so seeing myself drop closer to average in the BarBri scores was a shot to my confidence: Why was I scoring comparatively worse than I was before? Anyways, A few days later, without any additional studying I did just fine on the MBE as you can see above.

I know we are all stressed out law students facing imposing debt and bleak job prospects.  We are also generally people, by nature, who focus on the negative.  I have a really happy story from this week that I want to share, and I hope it brightens everyone's day.

I am currently working in an immigration law clinical program at my law school. We represent low-income immigrants facing deportation proceedings.  This is sometimes asylum proceedings, where the clients are sympathetic, but quite often we represent more unsavory characters guilty of domestic abuse or other pretty reprehensible activities.  My most recent client, however, was a legal permanent resident guilty of accidentally taking his wife's prescription pain medication because he hurt his shoulder in a work related injury.  He was on probation for drunk driving at the time, and failed a mandatory drug test.  He never had taken drugs in his life (other than alcohol) prior to this, and is a loving husband and father to his 7 year old daughter.

I argued his case before an immigration judge last week.  I have never argued a case in court before, and I was terrified going in.  I had met his family and done extensive trial prep with them at their house.  I met the daughter, his nieces and nephews, and even his two little terrier dogs.  They all came to the trial (except for the dogs) and looked just as scared as I was when I walked into the courtroom.

Long story short, despite the butterflies in my stomach, I NAILED the direct exam and the closing argument, and we won the case.  Our client is free.  He's back home with his family tonight.  This is the best thing I've ever done in my life, and I feel so much better about myself now than I have since I started law school.  The moral of the story is that while I have grown pretty cynical about law school and the legal profession, we can and will make a difference in peoples' lives by virtue of what we do as lawyers in the future!

I've thought long and hard about it, and it makes the most sense. 

My grades are average, I'm already in debt, and the job market is abysmal. But none of these are why I'm dropping out.

Law school has turned me into a miserable person. There have been days when I'm unable to get out of bed because I dread facing my life. This isn't what I want. This isn't the life for me. 

Of course, my mother is all over me about what I'm going to do with my life now. My answer? I'm going to brew my own beer, and see where that goes. Even if I fail miserably at it, it will never put me in as much debt as three years of law school would."	t5_2rb9g	True

Most people suggested I look at the job prospects objectively. A couple of you guys were encouraging. But I finally made my decision and I'm deciding not to go to law school. 

Aside from the advice I got from this subreddit, here's what I'm basing my decision on: I interned for a public interest foundation and I recently spoke with some of the attorneys there. One attorney asked me if I wanted to practice the law or if I wanted to help people. I told him I wanted to help people. I realized then that I shouldn't go to law school. My love for the internship had more to do with assisting low income clients than it did with practicing the law. I mostly felt indifferent to the doc review work I did there. So I'm giving up on my pursuit of going to law school. 
I spoke with my favorite professor a week ago and he told me to ""follow your bliss."" 
I'm getting my masters, then a credential to teach in high school. Your advice has really helped me. I just wanted to thank you guys for all your help and advice. "	t5_2rb9g	True

1339006709.0	uobbc	Things I did right, and things I did wrong my 1L year. 		84	16	26	"As I know this is the time of year that 0L's are starting to feel nervous about school, I thought I would start a thread about things we did right, and things we did wrong our first year.  

About me, I'm a rising 2L at a middle of the pack T2, my grades put me roughly in the top half/ third, and I have received about a half dozen unsolicited job offers this year.  So I'm an average student, with above average job prospects. 

**Things I did wrong (the longer list):** 

* Slept with law students. Every time I have done this it's blown up in my face.  One of these accidents I anticipate running into for the rest of my career. Needless to say, it's extremely awkward.   

* It took me awhile to figure out how to study.  Like many law students I breezed through undergrad without having to study.  Learning how to study is something I'm still refining, but it's important for me to remember to not follow what everyone else does, but to do what works for me.  For some reason gangsta rap, techno and push ups seem to help me.  I typically hate these things.  Also, non-crunchy library snacks and headphones.  

* pre-1L stressing out.  I spent a few months trying to prep for 1L, it was a giant waste of time.  If I had to do it again I would have spent the entire time chilling at the beach learning spanish.  A second language will help a lot, reading prep books barely helps (at best).   

* I didn't get a solid exercise routine down before school started.  Let's call it the 1L 12lbs.  But my fitness suffered 1L, as did many of my classmates. If I had this more figured out beforehand I wouldn't have to work as hard this summer to get my stomach back. 

* Same goes with high speed cooking. Sometimes I would just get super busy and start eating out.  This didn't really save time, and it cost a ton of money, and I ate like shit.  Keep groceries in your apt, and be able to cook them quickly (rice cooker, slow cooker, and microwave are your friends). 

* I lost touch with a lot of my friends.  I would get so stressed out that I wouldn't hang out with my friends, even though I ended up just wasting the time anyway.  Take breaks, remember the people that are important to you.   

* I didn't buy enough nice clothes.  I've found myself under-dressed on a number of occasions, and it's really embarrassing.  When I get some financial aid later this month I'm going on a shopping bonanza.  


**Things I did right (I think)**

* Kept booze at my house.  Not only did I need it on more than a few occasions, it's a great way to make friends (""hey, want to come over for a beer?"").  

* Worked my ass off in classes.  I briefed every case, did every reading, and tried to keep up with my outlines as much as possible throughout the semester.  Some people who are smarter than myself don't need to do this, but it helped me.  

* Worked my ass off outside of classes.  I did a ton of volunteering outside of the school with legal organizations my 1L year.  It adds a lot of stress to the school week, but I thought it was worth it.  My volunteering directly lead to 3 of my job offers, and it makes you stand out from the crowd.  

* I was focused on the type of law I wanted to do before school started.  When attorneys asked me what I wanted to do I had a short and direct answer for them.  This allowed me to start networking in the field I want to work in, and answer attorneys/ professors when they asked me what I wanted to do.  If you haven't figured it out yet that's ok, but figure it out sooner rather than later.  

* I'm good at faking confidence, while also being self deprecating.  I've worked as a blue colar professional before law school, so I'm good at pretending like I belong wherever I am.  Attorneys can smell fear, and so will their rivals.  Look confident without looking cocky. 

* I lost touch with my friends (This was in the things I did wrong column too).  I put 100% of my energy into my 1L year, and I think it's paid off.  It was a lot nicer to evaluate which job offer was best this summer rather than have to desperately apply for everything.  I just had an offer for next summer too (same supervising attorney as this summer) so it's nice to already have some security.  

* I didn't spend to much time on this subreddit.  This subreddit is filled with half awesome advice, half super [gunners](http://http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKXwj7ZrHIc).  Going into school and my first semester I felt like a failure for not scoring a 170 on my lsat, not going to Yale, and not having an in with biglaw.  If what I just described works for you, fantastic, but it sure doesn't work for me.  Maybe I closed myself off from the truth, but staying positive was important for me my first year, and not going onto this subreddit helped (I prefer lurking on /r/funny).  

If you're already committed to law school it's time to stop stressing.  You'll do fine.  Just try and identify the class idiot to make sure it's not you.  

EDIT: I almost forgot to say how much I fucking love law school.  Yeah 1L takes a toll on your sanity, health, and wallet, but it feels awesome to be on a track to doing exactly what you want to do.

People are buffoons. Don't engage in post-test discussions, you'll get a false sense of security because people are .. just dumb. Have faith in what you've studied and that you actually know the material. I felt like I was completely screwed going into today, came out feeling a whole lot better... If you know you're not going to sleep the night before, it's okay to abuse a little Nyquil. I slept like a baby... Slow the eff down. Read the questions all the way through. My first essay I had to rewrite because I didn't read that closely and it almost bit me. It sucks when ExamSoft asks if you're sure you want to delete 745 characters... It will all be alright. I have full faith you guys can do this. Breathe. Seriously. Breathe. You'll get a headrush if you don't. It also increases your blood pressure, and I guess that's not a good thing.. Also, take a nice, healthy pee before you go in. That way when your ""Oh Shit"" button gets pushed as they hand out the essay prompts or scantron, you know that the feeling you have is just butterflies and you don't legitimately have to pee. .. Slow down and read. I said that? WELL SHUT UP I'M STRESSED OUT, TOO! .. but honestly, do what you've done for every other exam that day. I see people in the lobby 15 minutes before who look like they're just cramming it all in. Don't be that guy. And don't ask people around you who aren't your friends what they thought or put. They likely just failed and don't want to hear your analysis of how you thought the parental rights should have been terminated. Just move on to the next topic... Finally, you're about to receive an unbelievable amount of support the next couple of days. Take notice of how awesome your family, friends and network are. You begin to feel like a real prick for your neglect the past couple months, and while you can't buy them all dinner, you'll probably start answering texts more. Remember, this whole mess isn't just about you, and life is more important that the bar exam. So, be nervous, but be confident and take care of your business. I'll report back tomorrow. ZQuil is calling my name. Stay strong and good luck.

A few months ago, I joined a local club for techies and there was an IP lawyer there that I got to know. He referred me to a job that required legal knowledge and knowledge of computers at the District Clerk's Office, which pays pretty good money considering it is in the public sector. I found out today that I got the job. I am incredibly excited.

I just want everyone to know that you may not go to the best law school, your grades may not be that great, but get out there. Be social with other people in the field. Network. Be that nice guy who everyone wants around. Get motivated. You can do it.

I graduated in May from a school with one of the worst employment figures in the country and just got hired as a full-time associate attorney at a Legal Services Corporation-funded non-profit. The reason I went to law school is that I wanted to practice public interest law, so this was perfect. A big part of my success was taking the bar in a state that didn't have a huge surplus of lawyers and being willing to work in a rural area. Pay is $40k. I did not have to look that hard, just smartly. I applied to a total of three jobs before I got an offer. One place has yet to acknowledge my application. I had telephone interviews with the other two. Nothing in-person. The reason why I did telephone interviews only is because I have been traveling internationally since August improving my Spanish-speaking skills. I am in Mexico City right now.

I graduated cum laude, and was involved in student government and the law review editorial board. I also did over 800 hours of pro bono legal work through clinical and practicum classes and worked part-time for much of my 3L year at a small general practice firm. 

Feel free to ask me anything, I'm happy to try to give insight as best I can to others who are struggling with the job search, especially those at T3 and T4 schools who may feel as discouraged about their prospects as I did for a while. I don't want to divulge my identity publicly, so if the question requires too much in the way of specifics, I may just respond with a PM. Also, I don't know if /r/lawschool is as strict about verification of AMAs as in other parts of reddit, but I'd be happy to send a mod pdfs of my resume and my offer letter."	t5_2rb9g	True

Downvote this all you want, but trust me, tears are pouring from my eyes as I type this, so it is heart-felt; so shame on you if you do, haha.

I am a ""successful"" law student.

My father and his best friend would rape me repeatedly.  

I grew up decently, I guess.  I had a lot of ""issues"" though.  I've been to rehab, psychs, jail, etc.  You name the situation and I've likely been in it.  I've dealt with everything from substance addictions to sex addictions.  No joke.  

My mother always thought she failed me.  My mother always had some idea of what I might have gone through when she caught me ""fucking"" my teddy bear as a child, but we never really new until I was a 2L.  It is, solely, the most shaping experience of my life; whether I was conscious of it or not.  

Nobody else in this world will give me props.  I just wanted to come somewhere and declare that I am an individual who has survived horrible things that, honestly, make me want to take my own life, but I am still here.  I am not only here, but I am on top of my proverbial game.  On top of everyone's game.  I managed to beat the odds.  I am not in porn.  I am not a stripper.

When you are all sitting here during these weeks struggling through memorizing your rules of law, please remember, your life isn't all that bad.  I thank God for the ""baby me"" who managed to block it all out.  

Anyway, if I could stand in front of my entire graduating class and profess the truth about my life, I would.  Unfortunately, we don't get to do that.  Therefore, I will take this forum as opportunity to do the following:

Ny Name is ***** and I am a victim of prolonged childhood sexual abuse.  I will be the only student graduating from this school with a corporate job.  I am, likely, the only student to have lived this long with these issues and be graduating in this class.  I wish everyone the best and hope to see you soon.

Thanks, /r/lawschool, for letting me have that moment.  :-)  It is probably as close as I will ever get to telling anybody the truth about me.  I feel really fucking good that I've made it this far.   :-)

Mods, you can see my i.p., I am sure.  Please, keep it to yourselves.  Thank you.

Again, thanks everyone, for letting me have my little moment.  :-)"	t5_2rb9g	True

* Went to a lower-ranked T1 school
* Been at the same V10 firm since law school
* Recently went through in-house interviews/recruiting with several companies and accepted a position
* Spent most of my career thus far working overseas
* Have done mostly corporate work but some litigation
* No, I don't think I'm awesome and need to have an AMA, but hopefully I can give some useful thoughts/info or at least a different perspective

**2:52 PM Pacific Time:** Sorry I'm being so slow in my responses.  Turned out to be bad timing as I've been tied up with work stuff but should be free soon.  Will definitely get to everything—hopefully all tonight.

**4:30 PM Pacific Time:** Back and typing away.

**6:30 PM Pacific Time:** My work is done here.  I'll check back in the future, though, and answer any more questions that come along, so please feel free to ask any time.  Good luck, and thanks for all the questions—that was fun. =)

You are in for a very hard fight. You have to give yourself every advantage you can. Network with members of the bar as much as you can, find professors who can mentor you and serve as references, and do your best to get good grades. Every time you cruise Facebook in class or spend a night getting drunk chasing tail, you're hurting your odds of making it. Also, you'll need to dick around a little in class and spend some time drinking and chasing tail just to stay sane, but you know, try to keep these things in check.

But here's the real advice that I wish I'd gotten: You can do everything right, go to a good school, get good grades, network, charm your professors, everything, and still fail. There's about 45,000 law grads and 25,000 law jobs, and even a lot of those law jobs are shit. It's impossible that every single one of the 20,000-25,000 people in crap jobs is a slacker shithead who deserves his lot in life.

And even if you don't do everything right you're not necessarily a bad person. It's a fucked up world that says if you didn't give 110% then you deserve any bad thing that happens. We're people, not machines, and your three years in law school should be three years of your *life,* not three years of Adderall-fueled inhuman cram sessions.

That's it. There is no formula. There's some good formulas, but none of them are perfect. If you don't end up with a decent job, could you have done more? Probably. Would doing more have gotten you a good job? Maybe. Maybe not."	t5_2rb9g	True

I feel like I've made a big mistake in my life, and I've already invested so much time and money I'm screwed whether I keep going or not.

I remember being warned before going, repeatedly, by people in and out of law school that it would be rough. Undergrad me thought ""no way, I'm smart, I'll come out on top like I've always done."" Nope. I'm barely middle of the pack at a mid-tier law school.

And then, of course, employment. The law market is brutal--I don't need to post the statistics here, but if you're paying attention at all, you know it's bad. I'll be lucky to make $50,000 when the student loan payments come in. Was that worth 3 years of life, paying ~$100,000?

In the meantime, I'm stuck here in 3L year with useless BS electives, 90% of which have nothing to do with the field of law I'm interested in or will be useful on the bar. Why does 3L year even exist? Oh right, for law schools to shake another $10-20,000 out of you.

I took an unpaid internship this past summer in the field of law I'm interested in. I enjoyed it--and the kicker is, I learned FAR MORE by working for other lawyers for FREE than I do in my expensive, boring, esoteric law school classes.

I'm almost disgusted and angry when I see on facebook or at my own school, new people entering 1L. I think ""don't you pay attention at all?"" And then I think, no, I was naive like them, too. And in one or two year's time, they'll probably figure it out like I have and wonder why they didn't listen."	t5_2rb9g	True
1343840544.0	xiiah	So you've taken the Bar Exam. Now What? Some practical advice.	EllisPhate	47	3	34	"I'm an Intellectual Property attorney who heads the Technology law division for an international energy corporation. I've practiced for eleven years. Five years in big law and 6 years in-house. Graduated from top 20 law school with a strictly B average. I can provide verification to the mods at anytime but reddit is new to me so I do not know the proper process. I can also do an AMA if there is enough interest.

I see so many questions on how to go through the law job process. I thought I can provide some insight from someone who went through the exact process and who has been involved in hiring side too.

First, I want to tell everyone that yes the industry outlook is bad. I completely empathize because I was right there when I graduated. I had no offers because I wanted to do IP law and they were only hiring engineers. I took the bar without any possible offer in sight.

Second, it's not the end of the world. It feels like it but it's not. The law industry goes through a big downturn just about every generation. Most people don't remember the energy crisis of the 80s. The dot com bust of the 00s. The real estate bust in the early 90s. However, there will _always_ be a need for lawyers until the zombie invasion comes because people need lawyers to function in a civil society. 

_So What Should You Be Doing_.

Critically review your Resume and Cover Letter. I mean _really_ review and ask yourself: is my resume and cover letter giving the hiring manager and HR rep the _right_ information to make an informed decision? If your resume is not drafted to fit the job listing or description it is useless to the hiring manager. You need to ""seed"" your resume with the ""code words"" and ""tags"" that are in the job description. You should have at least 4-5 different resumes emphasizing different areas and strengths to meet the requirements of the job. If you are using a generic resume you are not helping the hiring manager make a decision. A generic resume is bound for the trash bin because they are inundated with resumes. Also, is your cover letter seeded too? Is your cover letter conveying your enthusiasm? Your cover letter gets read. You need to bring your energy and excitement and specialness in your cover letter. If your cover letter isn't drafted specifically to the position it comes through. If you are not putting the time in your cover letter it gives the false impression that you are not considering the job worthy of your time. 

In addition, if you have grammatical and spelling errors in either document it is very obvious. It stands out. And it makes you look very very poor in the eyes of the hiring manager.

Networking. You should network, network, network. Even if you don't have a job yet, print out a set of business cards with all of your contact information to give to people that can make a difference. I love it when candidates have their own cards because I have it _right_ there and don't need to fuss with writing information down. I can organize it immediately at my office. Just put a title down as ""juris doctorate"" or ""juris doctorate candidate"". Whatever. It's the contact information you need to convey. The people you meet will have an impact. The regional bars are a small group. 

Differentiate yourself. Think very critically on what makes you different from all the other candidates. What's your background? What's your undergraduate degree. What practical business or industry experience to you have? The more differences and practical skills you can list it makes you stand out. If you have coding experience put it down. If you have specialized application experience, put it down. If you have research experience, you know the drill. 

Get any temp/contract job you can. Even at the temp contract legal firms, you will get some practical experience in document review and see what certain areas of law do. I did temp contract work while waiting for my bar results. I got to see how commercial litigation is really done and it informed my experience. Furthermore, you will network with many similar people in your situation. It created relationships I still have to this day.

I can go on and on but I think I wrote too long anyway. I will be checking in to anwer questions as they come.

About the school: I'm at a small school in the Southeast (in my hometown--wanted to stay close to my network) with an incoming class of 135.  Once my dismal first semester 1L grades came out, I was 94th.  I thought heavily about cutting my losses, but I figured I could try harder and improve.

I changed my study group, stopped taking notes on my laptop, and spent more time in the library after class.  After second semester, I was 58th.  After first semester of 2L, my rank is now 33rd of 109.  The significant drop was from a few transfers and the automatic exclusion policy for the bottom few.

Those of you who think you've seen all there is to see from law school after getting shit grades, take a minute to consider whether you're willing to work harder for the career path you thought you wanted to do.

Some people here seem to be having trouble understanding the difference between informative pessimism and outright nastiness. In the interest of keeping this place positive, I'd like to go over some guidelines about what's okay and what's not okay.

What's okay:

Posting numbers from LST, discussing why going to schools at full tuition that are unlikely to lead to full time legal employment is a bad plan, etc.

What's not okay:

Substituting the above for naked prestige whoring, and attacking people personally (*especially* when unsupported by the facts). There is a difference between saying ""going to law school, at most schools at full tuition, is a bad bet,"" and saying, ""if you don't go to HYS you should just drop out.""

Here are some examples, straight from threads here, of what *not* to do:

In response to a comment about being top 25% at Stanford/Cal/UCLA/USC, someone wrote
&gt;So top 25 percent at the schools you listed would likely land him a job in this economy making 70k? 60k? I thought the legal job market was more competitive than that?

This is both factually incorrect *and* a personal attack. The same poster went on to tell the ""top 25%"" poster that he was too lazy to get a job. Don't do this.

Someone else replying to the ""top 25%"" poster:

&gt;If your response is ""you don't know me"" rather than ""fuck you I'm going to Stanford"", I don't think it will be nearly as easy to get a job as you imagine.

Again, not only is this factually incorrect (According to LST, at least 30% of the graduates of each Stanford/Cal/UCLA/USC worked full time at firms with 100+ attorneys, and even more had full time legal employment), it is also totally inappropriate. 

If you have a problem with these guidelines, [please go here.](http://www.xoxohth.com/main.php?forum_id=2)

So anyways here are my questions.

1. Why pick Cooley? Did you just not get into any better schools?

2. Did you know about its reputation before your decision to attend?

3. What is your current attitude towards the school? Do you regret attending it?

4. What's the general attitude of the student body towards the school? Are they aware of what other people think of the school? Are they aware of their job prospects? 

5. What do you think of Cooley calling itself the second best law school in the nation?

6. What are the professors like? How do they feel about Cooley's reputation?

But if like many of your colleagues you aren't sure, please consider my advice.  (For those curious, I got tripped up on a bar exam by focusing too much on substantive material in the abstract and not enough practical application.  This led to huge time management problems on test day.  What worked better the second go 'round was to study the material *for the test*, not for itself (ie less time reviewing outlines, more time on MBE questions). You don't want to do this twice, and believe me, you shouldn't have to.)

First, time.  Don't stay up until 2 a.m. studying secured and think you're doing yourself a favor.  Work during the times when your brain will need to be ready for the exam (eg 7am - 7pm).  

Second, *active* application.  This last week is not the time to skim the outlines you got from the really smart guy from last year's class.  Now, you need to be begging/borrowing/stealing practice questions; making flash cards for wrong answers; timing yourself on blocks of questions.  The time is past for just using your eyes to read.  Get your whole brain involved.

Finally, focus on the MBE topics.  If you haven't learned *any* of the MEE topics, you might be able to cram for one or two of them... But for goodness' sake, the MBE itself is 50% of your score, plus (probably at least) two essays on MBE topics (5% each).  Assuming you do passably well on the MPT (20%), that all accounts for 80% of your total score.  That's guaranteed.  Now compare that to any single MEE question, which could at most count for 5% of your total score.

My first thought was... is this even voluntary with the drop in applicants?  Of course, it may just be that with the drop in applicants, the only way to keep their numbers up for USN is to cut the class size to keep out the bottom 10% of admits.  Letter follows:


&gt;Dear students, faculty and staff:
&gt;
For more than 90 years, Loyola Law School, Los Angeles has been faithful to its mission to “achieve and maintain excellence in the instruction of law” by adapting to changes in the legal profession. That is why the Law School has been at the forefront of curricular innovation, adding and enhancing practical training opportunities and modifying the curriculum to prepare students to meet the challenges of today’s world.
&gt; 
The Law School works every day to ensure that our students are primed to succeed in the current job market. We have decided that reducing our 1L class size by approximately 10 percent over the next three years will help achieve this goal. Reducing class size will allow the Law School to deliver to every student the practical skills training and personalized approach that have become cornerstones of the curriculum. Simply put, we will be a better law school if we get smaller.
&gt; 
A reduction in 1L class size requires a corresponding adjustment to our long-term budget strategy. Now, more than ever, we need to review our processes to ensure we are best equipped to respond to changes in the legal profession. I have created an Innovation Task Force charged with assessing areas where the Law School can improve. This group will evaluate ideas to improve the Law School and make recommendations to the deans. I want to emphasize: This effort is not just about reducing costs. It is about efficiency, developing new revenue and possibly even devoting more resources to certain areas to advance the academic and strategic goals of the Law School.
&gt; 
All of this work depends on input from you: our students, faculty and staff. If there is a policy, procedure, process or practice you think could be improved, now is your chance to effect that change. Suggestions may be provided in several ways:
&gt; 
&gt;·         Website submission form at https://my.lls.edu/innovation (LLS IDM credentials required for log in)
&gt;
·         Direct email submission to members of the Innovation Task Force Working Group (listed at https://my.lls.edu/innovation)
&gt;
&gt;·         Informational meetings with open comment periods later this spring semester
&gt;
&gt;This process will be ongoing, and your involvement is critical to its success. I encourage each and every one of you to become personally invested in the effort. Working together, we can make Loyola Law School a better place to learn and work. Please visit https://my.lls.edu/innovation for updates. Look for announcements about upcoming informational meetings on the Student Events Calendar and in In Brief. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me or any person on the Working Group listed at https://my.lls.edu/innovation.  
&gt; 
Thank you in advance for your commitment to Loyola.
&gt;
Sincerely,
&gt;

If you can be disciplined from the very beginning, spend 1/3 of time reading cases, 1/3 of time outlining, and 1/3 of time doing practice problems, you will completely dominate your classes. The thing is, people spend too much time in the casebook. They keep telling themselves, ""after this weekend I will know enough to start outlining,"" and ""next week I will be able to start taking practice tests."" That is what will bring you down. You will keep pushing those things back until the end of the semester and then you will not have enough time to do them properly.

I know I wouldn’t be where I am today without reading a ton of advice on the internet about law school, so I thought I would add to the body of advice on the internets by sharing my experiences and tips (also, I like to procrastinate doing projects). This will probably be really long. Also, a lot of this advice is geared toward people who want to work at a big law firm. 

**Deciding to go to law school:**

Going to law school is a poor choice for the majority of people who attend or are thinking about attending. That being said, there are a lot of factors that play into whether or not you should go. First, you should be able to articulate why you want to be a lawyer. If the answer is to make a lot of money or that you like to argue, then you should know that these are generally very crappy reasons. What kind of law do you want to do? If you want to work at a big law firm I would say you shouldn’t go anywhere outside the T14, and even then you should know that there is a very good chance you won’t get a biglaw job. I love my school, and I think it’s a very good school by a lot of measures, but I also know that probably 85% of the people who wanted a big law job (which is a lot of people at my school) didn’t get a summer associate position for the summer. 

 I’m also of the opinion that anything ranked lower than the T25 or so is (almost) never worth paying full price for, and taking out a ton of loans to go to them is only worth it for a very small number of people. Getting any law job of any kind is very tough right now, and I think the gamble you are taking by paying a ton of money for a school with a so-so or poor reputation is huge. A lot of lawyers are elitists; they love to rank things: LSAT percentile, schools, law firms, class rank, etc. This is a very shitty, but real part of the profession. 
If you can, I think taking time off before law school to work is a very good idea. Having some sort of substantive work experience helps a lot with OCI.

**Summer before law school:**

Don’t do a damn thing to prepare. Don’t even think about it. Relax, get drunk, do drugs, work out, get your life in order. 

**So you’re a 1L:**

The best advice I can give you is this: find out what method of learning and studying works for you and do it. Don’t think that because something worked for me or someone else that it will work for you. With that said, here is how I handle classes and reading and such.

Read every page assigned and go to every class. Pay very close attention. Read slowly and carefully, and if you find a word you don’t know look it up. If you didn’t understand something read it again until you get it. If you still don’t understand a concept go to the library, get a supplement and see if it can help you clarify. If you still don’t understand then go to office hours. Stay on top of things, and don’t play the “I don’t really get this, but I’ll figure it out later” game. I read the assignments for class the day before they are covered in the class, and I generally spend a lot of time on the reading (maybe ~1.5 hours per 10 pages depending on how dense the reading is). Take notes on what you read. Look for what rules are coming out of the case and how the facts of the case played into the rule. Other than doing the assigned reading I didn’t do any other review or studying until finals time.

 Don’t go on facebook in class, don’t g-chat with your friends in class, just listen closely and take notes. I refuse to ever bring a computer to the school, and I take notes by hand. I think taking notes by hand has several benefits: it’s less distracting, you have to think more and distill things before you write, and it means you have to read everything again when you go to outline later. 

Remember that you aren’t learning the law as much as you are learning your professor’s version of the law. For this reason, supplements aren’t nearly as useful as a lot of people make them out to be. 

**Outlining and exams:** 

I start outlining about 2 weeks before each exam. I go through and type up my hand written notes and organize them a bit. This outline is generally 70-100 pages long. I then go back through and try to make a condensed outline that is under 15 pages, but preferably under 10 pages. 

After your outline is done, take your professor’s old exams under timed conditions. Take as many exams as you can. Take exams from other professors in the same subject. Taking practice exams is probably the most important thing you can do to prepare for exams. 

Reread your outlines several times. Prepare for every exam like it is a closed book exam. 

The traditional law school exam will give you a narrative that is maybe 3-10 pages long, and then say “explain any legal issues.” Take your time reading the exam materials and jot down some notes as you read. Start writing your answer by attending to the most preliminary/broad questions first (e.g., in a contracts exam you might start with “does the UCC apply?”). I like to structure my exams by saying what each party is likely to say about a particular issue then writing how the other party is likely to respond. I keep this back and forth up until I have nothing left to say about the issue. Law school exams are about seeing how the rules that you learn create pivot points and mushiness for parties to mold using the particular facts of the case. You need to point out these areas of mush and say how the grey area it creates is going to play out in the context of the narrative the professor provided. The traditional exam is not about a “right” answer, but is about viewing the narrative given from different angles and saying which angle will lead to the most likely outcome. 

**Finding a 1L summer job:**

Early in the year, start reading up on what your options are. Don’t expect to be paid. Focus on finding something that will get you good experiences and don’t limit yourself to things that seem the most interesting. Apply broadly, start early, and invest a lot of time in the process. Finding a 1Lsummer job was probably the worst part about the first year.

**Transferring schools:**

After my 1L year I thought about transferring, but missed the boat because transfer applications are due pretty early in the summer. If you do well and transferring up is even a passing thought, then start getting letters of recommendation right away. 

**The writing competition:**

Take 1 day off after your finals are over, then get to work on the writing competition. I know it sucks, but take a week and spend all day every day working on the writing competition. Before you start, it helps to more or less read the bluebook. The writing competition is about attention to detail, and it’s likely that it will force you to use some of the most obscure and minute bluebook rules. 

**OCI:**

Again, do a lot of preliminary research on the topic and start early. Apply very broadly for screening interviews. It’s hard to know what firms you like without talking to some people at the firm, so apply everywhere. Prepare for interviews by reading up on firms using: chambers associate, above the law career center/lateral link, the firm’s website, and NALP. Know the basics of the firm and make of list of three things you like about the firm, the more specific to the particular firm the better. These things shouldn’t be general like: “I like that you work with big name clients/Bank of America/etc,”(most big corporations work with a ton of different law firms at once) or “I like that your firm gives a lot of responsibility to new associates”(all firms say this). 

Look up your interviewer and note anything particularly interesting about him/her or anything you might have in common with him/her. Overall, I found that I did better when I prepared minimally for interviews. Trying to memorize a whole bunch of information before an interview is distracting and made me more nervous. 
If anyone has any questions about any of this I will be happy to answer.

I finally found some time off from life and work, so I thought I'd try to give back to the Reddit community and draft up a brief guide for you guys.  I hope you find it useful, and I'm happy to follow up with any questions anyone might have.  So at the end, AMAA.    

I'm a first year litigator in biglaw, T20 grad.  I understand that my experience is somewhat limited, but I definitely remember the all the 1L stress that was purely associated with fear of the unknown--*i.e.* the unknown of what I was doing, what I should be doing, and what everyone else was doing.  I read everything I could, but I couldn't find quite what I was looking for--substantial input, and guidelines I could use.  


**I'm a 1L, What the Heck Am I Supposed to Be Doing?**
 
***Classes:***

Everyone knows that your 1L grades are far and away the best way of landing a gig.  The question here is really, ""How do I make it into the top 10%?""  

The best way to figure this out is looking through the eyes of a law professor.  Think about their circumstances.  Law professors are expected to research, publish papers, and make themselves (read: the school) more renowned in the legal community.  

All the while, they also have to teach a bunch of gunning 1Ls a little something about the law.  At the end of every semester, they are expected to make sense of a massive stack of hastily written, tear-soaked essays.  Just like most everyone else in the legal community, they do not have a lot of time to work with, and they want to do their job as quickly as possible while covering their responsibilities (read: butts).  

As for those responsibilities, law professors are essentially required to rank their students in numerical order based on one massive exam.  An essay exam, nonetheless.  Logically, how do you go about ranking 200 essay exams?  You have to employ some kind of metric.  That metric winds up involving some sort of point system.  

Against this backdrop, your job as a 1L is to make it as easy as possible for the professor to gloss through your exam and brainlessly drop points left and right.  In the context of issue spotters--which will be present on every 1L law exam--you have to: 

1) identify issues (points); 

2) accurately state the law (points); 

3) apply the law (points);

 4) apply the law differently (points); 

5) make an overall assessment (points).  

Let's break this down further.

1) identify issues:  The act of communicating a spotted issue should net you at least one point.  However, the more issues you spot, the more paths of analyses and hence more points will be available.  This should be clear.

2) accurately state the law:  This should be the easiest class of points to get.  Make sure you can concisely, and accurately state professor's view of the correct rule of law.  You do not want the professor to spend any time wondering whether your statement of the law right.  This will frame how he/she will view the rest of your analysis.  This should be quick, easy, brainless memorization.  

3) apply the law:  You have to demonstrate that you actually understand the nuances of the applicable rule of law, and how it actually works.  This (in my opinion) is the most difficult point to get.  However, this is where you can really stand out. 

4) apply the law differently:  This embodies the Getting to Maybe branches.  You need to make all reasonable alternative arguments, while achieving point 3)'s goal of demonstrating that you understand them.  If you argue for causation, while Billy argues for causation AND against causation, Billy gets two points while you only get one.  

5) make an overall assessment:  Pick your favorite application of law discussed.  The actual choice matters very little.  You just have to make one.  

So now you know what the goals are.  As for the plan for execution, as cliche as it is, ""everybody is different.""  Some people can just read the casebook.  Some people need to read hornbooks.  Some people need to take practice tests nonstop.  Everybody does indeed learn differently.  However, what you should do is keep tasks 1-5 in mind, and figure out how to develop your ability to execute these five tasks efficiently and effectively.  If you don't think your study plan is helping you improve on these five tasks, change it up.  Presumably, you're smart, and you can figure this out.  


***Networking:***

If you haven't heard people talk about the importance of networking, you must not be in law school.  What people generally fail to do is communicate exactly why it's so important beyond ""it helps you get jobs."" 

I'm assuming you've heard stories about how some job posting was up for all of a day and the employer was flooded with 200,000 applications submitted by Ivy grads desperately seeking to flip burgers.  But by flip burgers I mean review documents.  I'm also assuming you've heard stories of 2Ls and 3Ls sending out hundreds of applications only to receive hundreds of rejection letters.  This is why networking is important.  

As an analogy, let's say you and your roommate are looking to rent a spare bedroom in your house.  You post up an ad on Craigslist and 1,000 applications are stuffed into your gmail account within hours.  That afternoon, your moot court partner John tells you that his pal Billy, despite getting a higher grade in torts than him, is a good guy who's looking for a place. John says that he lived with Billy a while back, and Billy is respectful, responsible, will clean your bathrooms, do the dishes, and stock the fridge both with food and beer before you even think about asking.  What are you going to do first, flip through 1,000 applications, or call up Billy?  I'd probably call up Billy. 

Think about this further--what if you call up Billy, meet up with him, and he's a complete jerk?  Alternatively, what if you go ahead and have Billy sign a lease and he trashes your house?  These events reflect poorly not only on Billy, but on John as well.  

This is obviously obvious, but recommendations are powerful.  However, people generally only recommend people that they're confident about in order to preserve their own image. 

How this immediately relates to you is, law school professors, deans, and your summer employers are generally really well connected.  You're networking on day 1 of class, each time you get called on, and each visit to a professor's office hours.  You want to present yourself well because these people are potentially able to recommend you to people who can do something about your employment situation.  You don't want them to wonder if you're going to sully their reputation to the recommendee.  

However, by ""present yourself well,"" I don't mean be an annoying, know-it-all gunner.  In my limited experience, professors are much more receptive to students who are just genuinely interested in learning from them.  Think about it--by expressing interest in that professor's field of expertise, you're essentially feeding their ego.  Not in a bad way--people enjoy feeling knowledgeable and that their life's work is interesting.  

How this is relates to you in the medium to long term is, a lot of your classmates, colleagues, and coworkers will eventually be in a position to recommend you to potential clients, employers and opportunities.  You want to be known and remembered as the capable, personable, professional guy/gal that so-and-so went to school/worked with. 

Basically, don't be the shitty Billy.  Be the awesome Billy.  Awesome Billies ace tort exams and get invited to live in your house.  "	t5_2rb9g	True

A few of my stoner friends and I are headed to Law School this fall. I haven't talked to them about it, but we all smoke quite a bit and I'm not sure if I'll be cutting weed completely out of my life when the fall quarter begins. Obviously, for the first quarter or two it makes sense to have my head in the game and not do anything stupid. But I feel like it might be a great stress mitigator later on down the line in my law school career. I have high aspirations for law school, I plan on working even harder than I currently do at my high-responsibilities job and behaving in a professional and appropriate manner when it comes to my self-presentation, my preparedness and my interactions with students and faculty. I will be pursuing Big Law and I plan on immersing myself in lots of extracurriculars and taking this all very seriously. It's just that I do that with everything in my life, which is where weed helps me to decompress at the end of a stressful day/week/whatever. 

Questions: 

1. are you a Stoner Law Student? What is your class rank (if you don't mind)?

2. Do you know any successful Stoner Law Students?

3. Are there explicit drug policies forbidding marijuana usage at your school/most top law schools?

I took the MD bar, which according to some measurements, is in the top 10 most difficult (others rank it around the middle). Your mileage may vary. I passed.

I completed missed one of the essays. It was business entities (which ironically I now do a ton of work in), and I hadn't really studied LLCs in depth. I wrote down ""Business Judgement Rule, Piercing the Veil, Fiduciary Duty.""

I missed the key detail on the MPT that basically directed the entire analysis. I wrote a good analysis, but the entire question swung the other way since I missed a very key piece of information.

At one point, I was going over the MBE, and realized the it had been 28 questions since I last answered one (I use a ""if you don't know it right away, skip it"" strategy).

1) A close friend of mine, who was top of the class, in my bar review, studied hard and well, failed.

2) A second close friend of mine who attended bar review here and there, never read for class while we were in school, and who I know 5 days before the exam was NOT ready, passed.

3) An acquaintance that spent most of her law school days drinking, failed. But her four close friends that went everywhere with her in law school, they all passed.

4) After the first day, a fellow test taker told me ""I put A for the last 50 MBEs because I was running out of time."" He ended up passing.

5) A friend of mine had her laptop bug out. She was able to quickly fix it, and passed.

The moral of the story here is that it isn't worth wasting your time obsessing over the exam. People who prepare well sometimes pass, sometimes don't. People who don't prepare sometimes still pull it off and pass. People who feel great leaving the exam sometimes fail. People who feel awful do well. Sometimes their gut feeling is correct.

Everyone misses at least one answer completely. Everyone misses a key fact or point of law on an essay. Everyone completely bones a TON of MBEs.

And even if the worst happens, and you do fail, you just take it again. Yeah, it sucks. Yeah, it is embarrassing. Yeah, it does set back your career in an already tough market. But you know what? If you really are serious, you will get through it. Plenty of my peers who failed now have great jobs, some better than me.

So stop worrying, hug your friends and family, and get back to networking. Pass or fail, you are going to need connections to get a job, and loan payments are no joke."	t5_2rb9g	True

https://www.legalbluebook.com/

It's the bluebook with ctrl+f - it's super handy. By the end of 2L, you've probably got the bluebook pretty well memorized anyway, but until you reach that point, this site is really handy. Seriously. You're all like ""aww man, is manufacturing abbreviated in a case name? Well, lemme just search for that real quick.  And what's the abbreviation for Alabama? Ala.? Or is that Alaska?""  Quick search and bam! there you go.

Anyway, I just wanted to spread the word. 0Ls and newbie 1Ls are always hard up for protips about how to succeed ""c'mon man!

Won't get you any As, but it'll save you several dozen (maybe a couple hundred?) hours over the course of 3 years if you do a journal.

(x-post from r/law)	MenorahMan	65	34	108	"After my last post, I received a lot of PMs. Most were death threats because I dared mention that someone from a bottom law school was able to succeed, but others were legitimate questions about how I did. Here's my tips. I PROMISE these work. For everyone. Especially number 4. 

1) Make business cards for yourself. Vistaprint makes like 1000 for five bucks. 

2) Attend every single event your school has that you have even a slight interest in. Stay after, meet the speakers, get their cards. 

3) Offer to help set up these events! Two of my job offers came from people I originally met by scheduling them to speak at my school. 

4) Make an excel sheet numbered 1-100. Go to your school, google, whatever, and find some attorneys in the current field you are interested in. Email every single one of them. Every one. Simply ask if you can buy them a cup of coffee and pick their brain. Of the 50 or so times I did this, only 3 said no. 2 never got back. It works. 

At these small interviews, make sure they don't last more than 15 minutes (unless you're KILLING it). Ask them how they got where they are. What classes they think you should take. Any advice in general. Feel free to ask them things like, ""was it worth it?"" or ""do you like it?"" Then finally, ask them for a referral of others you should speak with. 

Full that excel sheet 1-100. I promise you'll find something promising before 50, and in most cases before 20. My father was in jail my whole life, my mother was absent, I have ZERO money, and I'm not a minority of any kind. I did this on my own. This works. 

Do it. Many here will say, ""Fuck you MenorahMan! This doesn't create jobs. This CAN'T work for everyone!""

Screw them. This actually DOES create jobs. One of my offers was a new position the CEO had been wanting to add and he felt I'd be good for it. Even if it doesn't for you, most students don't do any of this. I promise if you do, you will stand out.

So what are your thoughts about service? How do you think being an attorney in JAG compares with civilian practice? I'm also curious if you started out wanting to be in JAG for life or just for the minimum number of years required, and whether you've stuck to your plans.

That is NONSENSE. I was middle of my class and a very low ranked school and received four, six figure job offers upon graduation. 

How? Working my ass off networking. I wanted to succeed in this field so I set myself up in a way I could. Top schools on your resume sure make things easier, but stop pretending that's the end all be all. 

I was constantly working throughout law school in various fields, meeting every speaker at every event my school put on, joining every meetup and LinkedIn group there was, and volunteered to help anyone I could that was within three connections of being able to hire me.

1340428549.0	vh0ik	For those contemplating law school - someone who decided not to go (and still respects people that do)	cool_irl	32	5	17	"About a year and a half ago I was right in the thick of the law school application process. I put money into testmasters, took the LSAT, applied to about 12 schools, got accepted to a few schools, and was telling friends and family how excited I was about it.  I had been working as a paralegal since the end of undergrad (2 years), and thought this was the logical next step.  I even went to a spring orientation weekend in a different state (on my own dime).  My GPA was somewhat low, LSAT good but not amazing, and I was destined to go to a school within the  30 - 50 range.  

Then, in April 2011, I balked.  I decided to make the decision and not go ahead with the law school aspiration.  I realized that I was doing it because of the situation/job that I fell into after school - which was not what I had wanted.  The cost and the seemingly infinite reports about diminished job prospects freaked me out.  

The hardest part was... telling people.  ""Didn't you spend ____ on an LSAT course?  Didn't you apply to x amount of schools?  That costs a lot of money too, right?""  It wasn't a great feeling - especially coming from a successful family that expects a lot out of their kin.  Or friends that are already knee-deep in law school and are doing very well.

Instead, I immediately applied to do a post-bac in computer science at a state school in a cheap area - a 2 year program.   My original degree was in economics.  I'm a geek at heart, had done some hobby programming, and wanted to 'do what I actually want to do' before I got too old.  Quarter life crisis, I suppose.  

Fast forward to now, and I somehow pulled off a 4.0 in both semesters, obtained two undergraduate research positions, and am doing a summer internship at an international, market leading microprocessor manufacturer (well, they may as well be the only one) doing software development.

I'm not coming here to say that law school is always the wrong choice.  It's not.  I know many, many people who are and have been successful doing just that.  I probably don't have what it takes to be a great lawyer, and envy certain qualities of people that do.  

But - I want to remind those of you who are contemplating law school because there's ""nothing else you can do with your degree"" that you are still young.  If you find yourself having to remind yourself of the benefits of law school because you're on the fence, give it more thought than you normally would.  You may find that it reinforces your aspirations about law - great!  Or, it may guide you the other way.

My experience might be an outlier, but I am so incredibly relieved that I changed paths when I did (even with the sunk costs) because it allowed me to remember that I'm not bound to some 'logical' career path just because family/society/myself expects it to happen.  You have a lot more control than you think you do.

I was not really paying attention except they were basically right next to me and not the most quiet folk.

He walks away, and she asks what I do.  Moment of truth time ... do I tell her that I am an English teacher and hope she leaves me alone, or do I tell her I'm a lawyer, hand her my card and try to drum up some business.  I choose the latter.  She starts to ask questions, while telling me that she doesn't want to pay for legal advice, and when I told her that I couldn't give her an answer without looking at the documents she was referring to, she offered to show them to me on her phone.  I just narrowly escaped that one.  I told her that she could come in for a consult if she wanted and she started asking how much it would cost because she wanted legal advice without having to pay for it.

After seeing comments by unemployed &amp; underemployed recent grads &amp; no AMA on starting a practice, I wanted to make myself available to answer questions.  I'm going to crosspost to /r/law so that hopefully there will be others contributing.  (**Warning:** I'm posting &amp; then heading out for kids sports games &amp; a party, but I will be online some tonight &amp; a lot of Sunday to respond to questions.)  Speaking of kids: for those of you out there worried about balancing parenthood &amp; law, I have kept my practice part time which is an artform of its own.

In 2005, we opened our ""doors"" with little overhead.  We had laptops, cell phones, no staff &amp; virtual office space.  We now have offices, equipment, one admin, &amp; Ruby Reception which is the best thing ever.  My share of overhead now runs $3,000 / month, &amp; if I remember correctly my strict overhead (excluding things billed to clients &amp; home office deductions) ran ~$300 / month the first year.

Salary: In 2005, we started midyear.  My net in our 8 months operating in 2005 was $14,000 ($1,750 / month, working 25 hours/week).  In 2006, my youngest was born. For the 8 months I worked, my net was $50,000 ($6,250/month, working 35 hours/week).  For 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 &amp; 2011, my hours have varied based on kids' schedules &amp; trial calendar, but I make ~$50,000 when I work 20 hours/week &amp; ~$75,000 when I work 30 hours/week.  My work hours include reduced fee and pro bono cases as well as normal admin activities (marketing, presenting &amp; attending at CLEs, billing, payroll, etc).

My background before starting my own practice (&amp; I apologize in advance for graduating from law school at a time when jobs were abundant &amp; salaries rising): Prior to law school, I worked in the nonprofit sector.  I went to law school hoping to do exactly what I do now (reasonable hours, modest salary, family law).  For me, law school coincided with the tech boom.  Big firm jobs were abundant &amp; juicier by the month as base salaries rose. I took an AmLaw100 summer &amp; job.  I started my transactional AmLaw100 position in August 2001 as the tech bubble burst &amp; deals ground to a halt.  I was there two years trying to bill my hours when work was scarce, then spent one year working for a solo practice in family law, then started my own firm in 2005."	t5_2rb9g	True

I don't have great grades, at least not for my school. I've got about a 3.1 right now but after this semester I expect that to sink by a few points. Since starting law school, I've groomed myself to be a government lawyer. I like the work-life balance and the variety of opportunities in government, and just sort of gravitated toward it from the beginning. So both of my summers were in local government law offices (City Attorney/DA sort of thing). I also have a part-time job with the DOT in my city. So I have a fair amount of experience, but it's all in city government in one localized area of the country. I didn't do OCI--I never wanted to do biglaw and I didn't have the grades for most of the firms coming to my school anyway. That's a decision I still do not regret.

I really hoped that the job market would open up a bit more by the time I graduated, but it doesn't look like that's going to happen. My local City Attorney's office is in a mega hiring freeze that probably won't end for years. When it does, they have a volunteer program for people who can afford to work for free, and they'll pull their CAs from there. Every local government office around here is in a similar situation. The ones who are hiring have the pick of the litter and apparently I ain't it. I got a snazzy opportunity with a DA's office in the next county over, but at the second interview they told me there were over eighty candidates for the position. How the fuck do I compete with that?

I'm just feeling utterly hopeless. I paid sticker to go to my school because I thought the rank would help my job prospects. Now I'm almost $200k in debt and even with what I think are reasonable goals (local yokel government jobs...), I don't know how I'm supposed to find anything. I could try to turn my DOT job full-time after graduation, but it's administrative and not strictly legal. I feel like by doing non-law work after graduation, I'd be removing myself from the legal networking pool and my chances would only diminish further.

The one thing that has kept me going is that I know I love being an attorney. I've never been happier than the summers when I was actually doing real work with these local offices. But at this point I don't know how to make that career happen when I graduate. I really, really don't want to relocate, and I can't imagine things look much better elsewhere anyway. I could look at small firms but I have no idea where to start and I've never worked somewhere like that. My school's career center is *supremely* unhelpful and rude to anyone who isn't shooting for biglaw or federal clerkships.

Does anyone have any thoughts that might cheer me up? Any advice for how to squeeze into government jobs at the moment, or what other jobs I should be looking at? As for non-legal work, should I worry so much about that or is it okay to do something else for a couple years and then return to law?

tl;dr: I've got crappy grades and lots of good local government experience, but there don't seem to be any government jobs open to me. Is there any hope for my career?

Thanks for any thoughts you can offer...sorry this is so long."	t5_2rb9g	True

R/lawschool redditor Dedtired came up with the idea of having a ""ask anything"" bar prep thread.  This post will be stickied at the top of the page for easy visibility/ access for the summer.  

**What should go in this thread?**

Anything related to getting ready for the bar.  Feel free to ask questions, share study advice or exam material and, of course, talk about whatever bar prep course you're using and where you think the strengths and weaknesses are because future bar takers coming through here will want to know what the pitfalls are.  It's also OK to talk about what you plan on doing after the bar.  Of course, discussion isn't limited to only these topics.

If you find something particularly useful or important, be sure to bring it to my attention and I'll link to it up here.  

So, congratulations on receiving your Juris Doctorate!  You're now out of the pan and into the fire.  Hopefully we can get a 100% r/lawschool bar pass rate.  ;)"	t5_2rb9g	True

Like most law students, I was always considered a good writer throughout undergrad, but after taking four exams in the past 10 days, I've realized that while my answers may have spotted issues and applied the law to facts, they were terribly written. My Contracts exam, for example, was so long and difficult that I know at least five people who did not even get to the last question. I was lucky enough to finish but I'm sure my answers were typo-ridden and poorly worded. Plus, as I write my answers I tend to spot more issues in retrospect and then go back and shove sentences into previous paragraph with little eloquence.

So, how do you guys manage to write beautifully (or at least be organized) under the time and pressure constraints? I did notice that making a quick outline/diagram on the scratch paper for Torts helped, but not by much. "	t5_2rb9g	True

1372190866.0	1h25ku	What new features would you like to see from Law School Transparency?	bl1y	30	6	68	"Howdy r/lawschool,

Law School Transparency, affectionately known around these parts as ""Have you considered retaking the LSAT?"" is planning some major updates this Summer/Fall. We're looking primarily at programming changes, to allow users to a more customizable, personalized approach, especially when it comes to financial data.

Rather than sitting around theorycrafting about what y'all would find useful, we figured it'd be easier to just ask. Keeping in mind the limitations of the data we have available, are there any features you'd like to see added to LST? Would you like to be able to change what's in the Employment Score? Combine state data into regional reports? Be guaranteed a job upon graduation? ...Okay, some ideas are more feasible than others, but we're still largely in the brainstorming phase, so maybe your wacky idea will lead to something more productive.

Also, as many of you likely already know, LST is very poorly funded. If we had a nickel for every student who managed to get a job in ""International Law"" ...well, that's about how much we *do* have. We're thinking about doing a KickStarter for the new batch of updates. What do y'all think about that? Is that a service you'd be willing to contribute through? And, what if any incentives would you like to see offered? Physical things like a t-shirt or coffee mug would obviously start to dig in to our funds pretty quick. But, this isn't like producing a music album where we can offer a copy for free to donors. Actually, it is like that, except we're going to keep LST free for everyone, so it's not much of an incentive.

Thanks for your time, I look forward to your replies.

**Edit:** I know a lot of the responses have been along the lines of ""That's in the NALP report, which most schools don't share."" The schools have that data and can release it at absolutely no additional cost. Keep that in mind the next time we have a push to get more schools to release NALP reports -- we can always use the help of students and alumni."	t5_2rb9g	True

I got accepted to Oklahoma City University Law. With my scholarship, it is about $20K a year, but ranked abysmally. Univ. of Oklahoma is ranked higher and is cheaper, but I just did not perform well enough on my LSAT this time.

Here's what scares me about going to OCU: geting a fair to middlin' law job, exclusive to the region, where I only make what I already make now in accounting (between $40-50K per year), and hate it for the same reasons, but also have around $80K in debt that I don't have now. 

Here's why I wanted to go to law school: not to be rich, not to be a lawyer like the ones on TV, but rather to do a job (in my region) that I think is most aligned with my strengths and interests. I love critical thinking and analysis. I've always shone in these areas. If you do something you're good at and enjoy, you're so much more likely to succeed and be satisfied.

I don't like my accounting job (not real accounting like CPA or Tax, just accounts payable) because, while the pay is ok for a liberal arts major, the pressure and stress are nearly constant. I spend long hours in a cubicle crunching numbers and doing extremely tedious and repetitive work, and it is crushing my soul. From what I'm reading around the web, that doesn't sound too far off from what the typical lawyer does. 

Maybe I ought to just look at a career change before plunging into the lake of debt that is law school.

However, the judge spent 8 mins on a hypo, didn't even get 1 sentence in my roadmap. Crazy. Glad its over. Thanks for all the advice.

Hopefully this spurs a little discussion on the topic.  

Below is Dean Gold's message to students:


&gt;Dear students:
 
&gt;U.S. News &amp; World Report has released its newest law school rankings. The 2014 list places us at No. 68 overall out of more than 190 law schools. The Law School’s Evening Division Program was ranked No. 6 out of 82 part-time programs, making it the top part-time law program west of the Mississippi. Loyola was ranked in the top 10 in two specialty categories: No. 6 for Trial Advocacy and No. 7 for Tax Law. And we were ranked 20th on the Diversity Index.
 
&gt;Our drop from No. 51 is a big disappointment – especially on the heels of three straight years of rising in the rankings. In the latest rankings, U.S. News modified the methodology by which it calculates employment placement success. As reported in the National Law Journal yesterday, the methodology changes resulted in a ""high number of jumps up or down.""
 
&gt;All of this underscores the fact that the law school must work harder for its students and grads. We will devote additional resources to career services for current students and to programs aimed at assisting recent graduates get jobs.  As announced earlier this month, Loyola will reduce the size of the student body by 10 percent over the next three years. Quite simply, we will be a better law school if we get smaller. Loyola already has enhanced its academic programs over the last two years to emphasize practical skills. With more than 25 centers, clinics and practica, Loyola now provides students with the opportunity to put knowledge into practice in a huge variety of real-world contexts.
 
&gt;We will do a careful study of the new ranking methodology and work to improve. For a perspective on Loyola’s U.S. News ranking over the last decade or so, please see the following chart:
 
&gt;    Year Rank
    
&gt;    2014 68
    
&gt;    2013 51
    
&gt;    2012 54
    
&gt;    2011 56
    
&gt;    2010 71
    
&gt;    2009 63
    
&gt;    2008 66
    
&gt;    2007 65
    
&gt;    2006 58
    
&gt;    2005 72
    
&gt;    2004 69
 
&gt;As a final bit of context, I want you to know about recent rankings by two other publications. Last week the National Law Journal’s 2013 Go-To Law Schools Report ranked Loyola 39th in the nation for the number of 2011 graduates who filled associate positions at NLJ 250 firms. The National Law Journal  also ranked Loyola 27th for the number of its alumni promoted from associate to partner in 2012. Finally, Loyola ranked first in the 2013 Southern California Super Lawyers “Top 100” list with more than twice the number of alumni from any other law school.  I am proud of these achievements, but we need to work harder.  And we will.

I entered law school full of bluster and gumption, ready to voice my opinion when needed (mostly to satisfy my professors who bump up grades based on ""productive participation"").  I didn't plan on being obnoxious and answer every class, but at least once a week in each class.

What I didn't realize was that the students who lack native legal reasoning skills attempt to make up for this deficit by increasing their participation, with an overwhelming majority being vapid or unrelated comments or hypos.  

I'm so tired of all of the off-the-wall hypos and questions from people who obviously didn't do the reading that I keep my hand down in the hopes that we can move along more quickly to a productive area of discussion.

My law school has come down hard on the professors to be ""nicer"" and avoid being the stereotypical hard-assed law prof.  What that has translated to so far is that the professors are less likely to shut down the useless comments.  I'm hoping they start to reign in the serial offenders as the weeks go on because many studious people like myself just give up trying to get questions answered in class and head to the T.A. afterward if something isn't too clear.  

TL;DR: Increasingly off-topic comments and hypos by others in class is causing me to become quieter in class to the point of never talking."	t5_2rb9g	True

1328206106.0	p7yxm	So your grades put you below the median score?	cmac1988	32	5	12	"So, you’ve just finished your 1st semester of your 1L year. Went home, enjoyed some time off. Then about 2 weeks into the New Year, grades roll out and you find yourself in a less than enviable position. Under the Median Score....these might be the worst grades you have ever gotten. What are you going to do?!

Before discussing any courses of action, lets talk about some things you should know. First, you are below the median score. So is half the class, so are half the people in law school. Second, take a look at how you are doing things, not what you are doing. If you are having problems in Contracts, but not Property, or Con. Law but not Torts, the problem might be in how you are studying for these classes, or how you are writing your exams. I’ll let a fellow commenter handle study tips. Third, go in and talk to the professors.  Ask them to go over the exams with you and tell you what they would have like to have seen in your exam. The point of this is to determine what your professor wants. Once you know that, it is much easier to give him/her what he/she wants and get something more in line with what you want from them. Fourth, take a deep breath. Fifth, tell yourself the following mantra “You got in, you’ll get out, and you’ll pass the bar.” These are what makes a lawyer, not getting a top third grade in 1L torts. Sixth, look into some “legal skills” clubs, teams, classes, or jobs. If you don’t have a stellar GPA, the most helpful thing to do is to bolster it with good skills. Doing well in a Moot Court, Client Counseling, etc competition shows you have the tools beyond the books. Working for a firm, even a small local firm, gets you real world experience. Many of the people who had better grades than you won’t even know where the courthouse is located, let alone how to draft pleadings that weren’t in their Legal Writing Class. If you can draft Interrogatories or a good Coverage Opinion, or know how to get an Order in Aid of Execution expedited, then you make yourself invaluable to firms. These are the tactics I have taken, and so far they have worked with a fair amount of success. I received outstanding oralist in a Moot Court competition, work for a small local firm doing substantive work, and every day I remind myself  that “I got in, I’ll get out, and I’ll pass the bar.”

1372986376.0	1hnzkg	Some hopefully non-obvious tips from someone who took the bar exam last July	TyrionSwaggister	25	0	23	"* *Do it right the first time* You're all coming down the home stretch. This isn't the time to take your foot off the gas. Put it this way: Failing the bar exam is a terrible feeling, but you *absolutely do not* want to wait months for results, fail, and then wonder to yourself, ""What if I had done more, studied harder, etc.?  I know you're tired of jamming useless into into your head, but this is it. You definitely don't want to have to spend another 3 months doing it all over again, and then waiting another 2/3 months for results. Do it right the first time, it's (probably) the last test you'll ever take.

* *Dress for winter* I can't speak for other testing centers, but Atlanta's testing conditions were beyond atrocious. It was subzero in that room, and I had 3 layers on, including a jacket. Point is, don't dress for July weather. You can always take layers off if your center is at a comfortable temp, but if you walk in with shorts and a T-shirt, and you're wrong, you're done. For context, I love it to be freezing, I have my thermostat around 70, and I was *shivering* in that room.

* *Take whatever time you were planning on leaving for the testing center and leave 45+ minutes earlier than that.*
I had a 10 minute drive to the testing center, and left 45 minutes before test time. I *barely* made it there on time. There was a huge line to make the turn into the center, from both sides of the street. I must have sat through 5+ cycles of the traffic light to make the turn into the testing center, and that wasn't the end of it. There was ONE parking lot cashier working that morning! Point is, you don't know what it's gonna be like that morning. I planned for traffic into the testing center, but it was 10x worse than I expected. Maybe there's a wreck on the highway that morning, or some unexpected construction (on that note, it might not be a bad idea to drive by the center the day before to check). Getting there by the seat of your pants will only add to your anxiety. Leave yourself some time to get seated, acclimated, and calm down.

* *Study smart, spend more time covering modern topics* 
Many instructors in my bar review course (Kaplan) said that the bar examiners were cognizant of antiquated areas of law, such as future interests and RAP, and were shifting away from it, because, well, it's worthless. Conversely, they were putting more emphasis on topics such as mortgages, given its practical nature. There were a ton of mortgage questions on the MBE. Maybe that happens again, maybe it doesn't, but you don't want to be guessing on those. By all means don't blow off future interests, but don't spend much time on it either. If it's on there, it'll probably only be 1 question anyway.

HTH, I'll add more as it comes to mind. 

GOOD LUCK!

Edit (7/28/13): DO NOT BLOW OFF THE MPT! A lot of people seem to blow this off, and trust me, you don't want to do that. I'm not saying spend a great deal of time with it, just one particular aspect, finishing. YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST FINISH, NO MATTER HOW VAPID YOUR REASONING/SENTENCES/PARAGRAPHS ARE!
We had a former MPT grader in our bar review course, and she said it's MUCH worse for your score if you don't finish the assignment than if you finish and have a skeleton essay with weak analysis.

Also, bring some sort of light. A keychain light, or something of the sort (but check the bar examiner's website for what's permissible, of course) I've heard that the power went out at one testing site (not in GA) and no additional time was given. You just never know..."	t5_2rb9g	True

First - thanks to the new mods of the hypobank. You guys have been really on the ball with adding people.  

Our AMA series is doing really well.  We've had some really excellent attorneys come and do AMAs, so a special thank you to all of them who feel like coming in and letting everyone get a window into their professional life.  It's hugely appreciated.

Thank you to EVERYONE who worked on the FAQ.  It's now using the new wiki page and we can easily approve new editors if anyone wants to clean it up or add sections for the upper division students.  

---

**On that note - 0Ls - please read the FAQ.**  The community wrote it specifically with you in mind.  Bl1y was kind enough to have us use his team's research for job prospects around the country which is sourced from NALP data, so now you can look at your potential law schools and really weigh the all important personal question ""will this place set me up where I want to live and work?""

---

**One more new subreddit rule:** (we only have one other hard and fast rule in the sidebar) if a 0L asks a question about law school, one line responses saying ""don't go"" or something to that effect with 0 explanation or direction are going to be removed if the mods notice them.  It's rude, flippant, and unhelpful.  Please, just point them to the FAQ.  

If you give someone a legitimate answer and they get combative, I don't really care if you embarrass them though.  That scenario seems pretty rare.

---

**A note about memes.**

I know memes can be fun, but please resist the urge to make memes when you're bored in class and clutter up the front page.  Yes, there are gunners in your class.  Yes, scumbag scalia writes a lot of mean dissenting opinions.  Yes, undergrads are annoying.  Yes, you don't do all the reading and you have no job. 

Memes aren't banned or anything like that, but try and submit content for discussion or make self posts with more explanation about what you want to talk about.


---

**New Community Project**

* I'd like to take advantage of the new wiki system.  Initially when I wanted to launch the outline bank I wanted to have a wiki people could edit into 'reddit commercial outlines'. It would be easy to keep updated with regular editors/ people sifting through it BUT there weren't enough people here (at the time there were maybe 5 posts/ day).  

Now we have a lot more traffic and after the success of the FAQ, I think we can at least build outlines for the 1L topics.  **Can I get Volunteers to get it started?**

After the basic outline is up, I'll open it up for more editors to come tinker with it.  

The new wiki system is very intuitive.  The table of contents creates itself using hash tags from headlines 1 (#) to headline 6(######).  (i.e. #this would be headline 1.  ##This would be headline two).  The CSS is already in place to make the headlines different colors, so you don't have to worry about making anything pop using color (and you're of course welcome to message me to adjust colors/ solve problems).  

* Bl1y suggested we have a 'reddit journal' for people who want to post their publications, or at least post them here and boost their SSRN ranking.  I'm not sure of the best way to execute it though.  Any ideas would be great.



I think that's it.  We're also open to feedback. If you think something is awful - let us know.  If you report something - please send a message saying why it's reported.  If you want to do something fun with the traffic here, please let us know and we'll consider your idea.  It's fun to build stuff.  :)

Again - thank you guys for making this place what it is.  It's come a LONG way from it's tiny beginning a couple years ago.

I felt as if my guts twisted up and fell out of my anus.  I could not have been more surprised. I cold tested my first practice LSAT at 156 and was doing a consistent high 150’s in practice.  I figured after all my practice I should take a course just to be sure so I took the blueprint course.  I walked in thinking that I was going to score high.  The logic games crushed me. I barely finished the first question. It was like all of a sudden I was looking at something I had never seen before. 
I had no other plans besides law school. My undergrad was polsci and prelaw. I have a 3.9 GPA but this score crushes my chance of getting into a top school. I figure if I go to a school like Florida coastal I will find it hard to get a job after.  My life is spiraling. My only options I can think of is take the GMAT and go MBA or continue polisci and get a Doctorate. 
My brain sure picked a great time to go on holiday.  The whole episode makes me wonder if I have ADD.

1320438947.0	m0pg5	Things I wished someone told me: Tips for 0Ls &amp; 1Ls	RBRR	31	8	24	"The following is what I have taken from my experience in law school. Please do not mistaken this advice as being from a standpoint of know-it-allarity or bitterness, but as a concerned older sibling that warns you about everclear on an empty stomach. 

0Ls:
While I commend you for your unbridled enthusiasm for wanting to get ahead, stop. Just stop it. Reading supplements or getting a ‘jump’ on 1L cases will NOT help you. Honestly it might hurt you. Every professor is different on how they want you to interpret law. Hell, I have had a few professors that made up their own law on what THEY thought it SHOULD be and tested us on it. Is that how law school should be? NO. But thats how it is sometimes. Here are a few common questions I see 0Ls asking:

1. What should I read to prepare for law school?

	Anything but law. Seriously get caught up on all those books you want to read, because during law school, at least for the first couple years you will not be wanting to do any reading after a long 50 page case with a 20 page dissent concerning a contract about lettuce. 

2. Is there anything I can do to better prepare for law school?

	Yes. 

a.) Think REALLY hard about why you are there. Honestly the economy is SATURATED with law school grads right now with minimal jobs available. Do you really want to take on 80, 100, 200k in debt and then graduate with a low probability of landing a job good enough to pay those debts back? If law is your passion go right ahead, but as a 3L with many friends long since graduated and still working for free, I would reconsider your career choice, or at least your timing. 

b.) Spend time with your family and friends. Because during the first year you will not be able to. Make sure your significant other knows that they will not be your #1 priority for at least the next year and you will be busy as hell for the 2 after. I saw many many a relationship fail during the first year...second year and in third year they are still dropping like flies. So be prepared for that. This is not coming from bitterness, I kept my relationship together (now happily married) and likely sacrificed some grades for it. Just know, its give and take. 

Some tips for 1Ls that I wish someone told me:

1. Don’t get wrapped up in all the stress. Worry about yourself, and yourself only. It doesn’t matter that Joe Shmoe is at the library all day. He's probably hung up on the difference between general and consequential damages. Or maybe hes surfing facebook in the library because his internet at home is down. Don't worry. Keep focused on your own work. (Seriously I had friends who would talk about who was in the library and for how long. How old are we?) Do what you feel is right for you. Forget what everyone else says, yes that goes for the school too. Don’t feel like briefing a case is helping you? Don’t do it. Don't feel like outlining is helping you? Don't spend the time on it. Simple. 

2. Don’t talk about how much you studied or what obscure issue you spotted on that exam. Actually, don’t talk about exam answers period. You come off sounding like a know-it-all and it makes people nervous. Don’t say “I studied for like 8 hours yesterday” NO ONE CARES. Seriously. I can’t even count how many times I have heard this. While people may play along, they are secretly thinking about how douchey you sound. This goes for facebook statuses as well. Don't post a status every time you study ""Going to study Crim law today"" again, no one cares. Write it on the top of your word document if it makes you feel better. 

These are the main things i think people fall into. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to act.  I will answer with brutal honesty based on my own opinion. This might be downvoted into oblivion, but these are the things that people talk about ALL THE TIME regarding 0Ls and 1Ls and I thought I would bring them to the forefront. "	t5_2rb9g	True

I'm not from the US but I recently just finished my undergraduate on Communication (specializing in advertising and public relations) last March. I was accepted in the top law school of my country for a Juris Doctor degree and am currently into our 2nd/3rd week.

I wasn't sure what else I would do after graduation so when I found out that I passed exams I didn't bother studying for, I thought I'd give it a shot. I genuinely prepared, went to school diligently, paid attention as if it was something I had always wanted to do. 

Except now, I don't know if I want to stay.

The thing is, my main reason for taking the exam was because my grandfather, grandmother, and father were all lawyers. They and the rest of my family encouraged me to take it because they believed that I would be good at it. I have no problem with going through the codals or comprehension of the cases.

But I have no motivation to stick around. Not personally, anyway. The only thing this gives me at the end of four years is a professional degree and a title to brag about. Job security is not one of those guarantees (though my father says that he will get me a job no matter what). 

I'm not a fan of the constant stress, or of the absurd amount of readings required (ranging from 150-700 pages for a class that happens once a week), or of the absolute demand that law school requires simply for you to pass after being treated like trash by the professors (as per tradition, of course). I never fancied working in a law firm, or hacking it out at a court, or becoming a judge/justice, or becoming a politician (where any form of formal education isn't even required). 

Everyone I'm asking now is telling me to stay. Every single member of my family is telling me that I'll regret quitting.

And that's part of why I'm hesitating. I don't want to disappoint them. The first thing my grandfather said when he found out I passed was: ""Thank God, now I can look down from heaven and smile when you pass the Bar exam.""

My friends are telling me to get out. To find out what I really want to do and do it. Even if it means a job that isn't quite as grand as that of a lawyer. Even if I'm not quite a fan of what career options are immediately available to my undergraduate course.

There's more risk in getting out now. But I think I'll be happier. I think. (Would I regret it? And think: ""what if I had stayed?"")

I don't know.

Please, any words you can offer would make me absolutely grateful.

0L Prep
Don't do it. If you insist on doing something, read/skim Getting to Maybe and Law School Confidential at the absolute most.
Why?

1) You could be learning the material wrong! Even in supplements that were recommended by my professors, there were points of disagreement and quirks in how the prof wanted the analysis. If you spend your time learning the supplement/hornbook/whatever, you will likely have to re-learn it the professors way. For instance, in Torts, my professor used the RST 3d approach to proximate cause, which is completely different from the way you would learn it in a supplement! You shouldn't know what that means, suffice to say the variation among professors and supplements is significant enough that you should not start reading substantive material. In every single class I took, there were times when the supplement and my professor outright contradicted one another on the exact same point (hint: your professor is always right).

2) You're wasting your time! Most of the material you would spend your time going over will never be covered. Further, it will be difficult for you to separate this from the material you actually did cover when you go through the class, and when the final exam rolls around you might not be able to remember whether the issue you spotted was something you talked about in class or something you read over summer. And even if you do remember you learned it over summer, you might be tempted to write about it anyway for extra points. That's a mistake because no professor will give you credit for discussing material that was not in the reading or class discussions.

3) You will burn out. This is not a question of if, but a question of when. You're excited now, but by the end of your first year you will be thanking whomever you pray to that it's over (and then you'll have to do a write on). The sooner you get to work, the sooner your enthusiasm will deplete. This will make it considerably harder to push yourself to study and learn even when you desperately need to. And in these times, you will wonder why you did not enjoy to the fullest every moment you had before coming to law school.

4) This is your last moment of freedom. You're going to be busy until next May. Really busy. Not only that, but next summer you will have a job; the summer after that you will have a job; and the summer after that you will prepare for the bar; and after that you will go to work for a firm. Unless you get lucky and work at a firm that defers employment and funds your living expenses for a year while you go travel (not unheard of, but very rare), this is your last chance to take time off and hike/travel/whatever for the foreseeable future."	t5_2rb9g	True
