1371325249.0	1gexq8	Broken gender change feature and horrible community reaction	Lorastina	2693	524	267	"So I rolled a Male character on the European server. It was fine for the first two dozen levels or so, but then I realized I made a mistake and wanted to change to Female. Much to my dismay, the option to change it was nowhere in sight on my character menu, and there's no gender change item in the cash shop item either. I tried just wearing Female clothing but there are clipping issues with Male bodies. 

When I asked in general chat, I found out that gender change was never fully implemented and the only way to access it was by glitching my character with the help of a [Doctor] player. I teamed up with one who knew about this glitch, and he gave me these weird crafted consumables that were supposed to slowly change my player model and texture. I started taking them while continuing to grind levels and now my character is Female but you can kinda tell that it's glitched, overall I like the results anyway.

Now here's the part that makes you realize just how shitty this game's community can be. As soon as players around me noticed I changed my gender, I got kicked out of my guild, almost no one teams with me anymore, no one roleplays with me etc, basically a ton of players are calling me a sploiter and giving me grief over it. I'm getting a lot of PvP duel requests too. 

This is absolutely ridiculous. I've read the TOS and there seem to be no specific rules against what I did and it's mostly a cosmetic feature anyway. I know of players who, for instance, can sploit gold like crazy, and no one seems to care as much about that, what's the big deal here? All I can say is, this can be pretty frustrating at times, and I just really hope the devs eventually either fix character creation or implement a proper gender change feature. As for the sad state of the community regarding this, there's not much to say, a lot of them just put you on their ignore list if you try talking to them :/

1373079080.0	1hq97q	Has anyone here ever seriously considered deleting their character?	Grandy12	2418	685	452	" I sometimes have. It comes down to the small things that bother me in this game, the community, the pay-to-win features, the frustratingly hard learning curve once you hit level 18, and so on. But the thing that bothers me the most is that, just like most massive multiplayers out there, there doesn't seem to be a point other than leveling up to the highest you can. I find it hard to keep upping character skills and acquiring GP only to have that nagging reminder in the back of my head of how the levels and GP don't actually *do* anything other than letting you acquire more levels and GP.

I still havent deleted my profile, of course, since otherwise I would be unable to use the in-game chat like I am now, but sometimes I wonder if that is not due to just being addicted to the game, instead of enjoying it like I did back when I was a newbie and every feature seemed new and original.

GlassJoetheChamp	1680	471	102	"So I found this glitch a while ago when I was grinding my relationship stats with another player. We leveled up all the way to ""Long Term Relationship"", but when we tried to advance to ""Marriage"", it wouldn't work, and the game froze up. 

After investigating, I think it has something to do with the fact that both characters rolled ""Male"". What's weird though is that it only affects certain regions. I know two players in the Canada region who didn't run into any glitches, but most of the Mid-North American region has been affected.

It's not a big deal right now since I'm focusing on the ""Job"" questline at the moment, but without the ""Marital Status"" perk, I feel like I'm at a disadvantage over other players.

It seems like the devs are aware of this problem and are installing patches in areas like Vermont and California, but it'd be easier if they just created a patch that could fix the entire region. "	t5_2r3f3	True

1375644018.0	1jp01z	Quick rant - Am I the only one who hates stat decay?	DidntGetYourJoke	679	110	98	"I've played a lot of games, and I think this is the only one with stat decay implemented, and I absolutely hate it!  In WoW/EQ/etc, if I go a while, even a few years, without practicing a skill and then decided to use it again, it will still be at the same level I last had it.  But not here, oh no, someone decided it would be hilarious to start from scratch here!

For example, when I was working through the tutorial stages doing the [Elementary School] quest line, I did a fair bit of levelling on the [Piano] skill.  I reached a pretty decent level where I could play some mid-level songs and read sheet music.  However, I moved on to other skills and went a few years without practicing and now?  My skill is reset to level 1!  I have to start from scratch and work my way back up to a skill level that I had already previously reached!

Another example:  When I was doing the [High School] quest line I worked a lot on my [Endurance] and [Running] skills to the point where I could run a mile in 6 minutes.  I stopped practicing those skills after I finished that quest line and recently tried them again and once again found myself screwed by the game mechanics!  Both skills had reset to almost base level and I struggled to run a single mile in under 10 minutes!

There's been no content patches since I started playing, and the only evidence that they ever gave a shit is a book that *other players* wrote about one of the dev's son coming on and showing off. He to be trying to remind players of the rules but he didn't actually ban any offenders. Besides, I'm pretty sure he was just a hacker.

There's been a bug for millions of years now where dying in-game bans your account permanently. It can't be that hard to fix, but do the developers give a fuck? No. I'm actually glad that bug exists, since it allows for some self-moderation by the playerbase. That wouldn't be necessary if there was *any* moderation by the staff, but I digress. The bug makes PvP about the worst idea in the world, and many players will take it upon themselves to punish you for it.

The game is so buggy that players have been able to use exploits to get to areas that no one was intended to be. A few players have actually gotten to the moon, and there's some initiative to start an unofficial ""space"" expansion, but work is slow and I doubt that there's *that* much unfinished content anyway.

Despite all this, the player population is *growing*. And that's an issue, too. The servers weren't designed to support this many people.

The original text of the post reads:



&gt;    I met a player nearing level 100 today, at an event of the [Politics] quest-track. Out of respect and awe I didn't ask him exactly what level he was, although he obviously had very high EXP.
&gt;
&gt;    According to his tales, he had helped found the [Amnesty] clan, and traveled to many unsanctioned PvP events of the past epoch in order to spread word about the goings-on there. He didn't let his massive EXP get in the way of his INT (although I actually needed to assist him with DEX and STR), and he revealed that he spends his playtime now in [Politics] in order to get players to worry less about the Devs and focus more on their own quests.
&gt;
&gt;    All in all, an intriguing encounter that made me feel that my LVL 21 [Soldier] has been pursuing all the wrong quests.

Reading the guidelines, I can't see anything wrong with what was written here, and it was a genuinely interesting post, so I'd like to hear from the mods why they removed it.

I don't want to delete my current character, which my friend says you have to if you want to play again, and not only do you lose all expierence but you contacts get scrambled and they don't always spawn you somewhere level appropiate.

Is it possible to get another charatcer? How about 2 or 3 extras to hop between when I'm waiting for my cooldowns?

I've heard the female run through is a lot of fun, especially if you max out your appearance stat you can basically coast with a low intelligence and other physical stats, though the 9 month time out it takes to summon an NPC seems a bit overlong, are they going to balance that?

Also what mod do I have to talk to so I can be a luxury class character? I'd like to join the European servers but I was told they are really hit an miss, and the Greece server just had a really big down time. Maybe I can find an open slot in the UK or French servers?

[Maturity] stats are currently at that of a level 16 player's, and [Social] stat is even lower (~level 13 equivalent). 

I have been collecting 'self-improvement' and 'Body Language' scrolls  and reading them daily to enhance said stats. But I heard that training [Social] stat is fastest and most effective in maps with [Social +] buffs (e.g. Mall, Coffee shop, bar, club etc.). But I am worried about the possible risks involved in such maps, as players who were 'targets' in my [Social interaction] training may recognize me in other maps on different occasions, which may cause AOE debuff of [Self-esteem] and increase my character's built-in [Anxiety] condition (Planning to see a healer (Psychiatric) to find cure soon).

Also, most players in my server are less receptive to 'player to player' interaction as compared to players in western servers. Are there any maps with [Social +] buffs that I could enter and also would avoid  recognition by other players?

Also, are there any guides/scrolls that would help boost maturity stats? It seems I missed out the initial issue by the mods as I started to explore the server later in the game."	t5_2r3f3	True

1359040483.0	176x78	My first thoughts on Outside.	avapoet	151	19	9	"I've been playing for a little while now, and here's my thoughts so far:

* I love the open world aspects of the game; I've never played anything where there's been quite so much freedom (especially when you're just starting out). It's taken a while to get used to the areas which are only accessible at certain times of day, though, like some of the shops. Also: the quest-givers who seem to give me the most money seem to want me to complete missions during the same hours that the shops are open, so I have to choose one or the other - what's with that?

* Sometimes I feel like I'm stuck, but I've discovered that if you try enough things, eventually something will work. If you go around picking everything up, it'll probably be useful at some point (but be careful because the NPC guards will stop you ""stealing"" things!), and you can sometimes get great results by using combinations of things (for example, I tried imbibing a potion of drunkenness and then wearing a traffic cone the other day, and I'm pretty sure it gave me an invisibility buff: no matter how much I sang, everybody ignored me!). Inventory management is a bit of a pain, but picking up a rucksack has really helped.

* Not so impressed with the NPCs. I've learned that the best approach to getting information and quests is to talk to everybody, but most of the people I talk to don't want to say anything, or just repeat the same few phrases over and over (""Go away,"" ""Stop bothering me,"" etc.). I've tried offering things for trade, but most of them aren't interested in my traffic cone or my crayons or my rucksack: I'm honestly not sure what most of them are for!

* Anyway: I know that some of you must have been down this quest track, too - I've seen you wandering around wearing your traffic cones and carrying your rucksacks. So I'll jump ahead a bit and save from spoiling it... Here's where I'm stuck: I'm in the padded room in the hospital, and I can't get past the boss of the doctors. I tried eating the crayons, to see if they'd give me strength (one of the NPCs here suggested it), but it doesn't work. The doctors are a seriously creepy monster, by the way - they keep talking about you having ""delusions"" or something - but I'm sure there's a way to get back to the main quest track. Any tips?"	t5_2r3f3	True

1355109622.0	14l0jd	Sleep is seriously broken.	buster2Xk	140	16	7	"Everyone is familiar with the sleep mechanic. Every character can only play for a certain amount of time at once. As you continue playing, Drowsy debuffs are gradually applied to your character with various negative effects. The player must find a bed (any spot will do really but beds are best) and stop playing for a while. Fair enough right? I mean, it'd be crazy to have all seven billion people playing at once. The way the sleep mechanic tends to cycle through the regions is cool too, players will tend to get tired at night so a little more than half of the total players will be playing at any given time.

However, this causes some major issues.

First of all, it breaks the shit out of PvP. A player who is asleep has virtually no protection from PvP. There is the sleep cancel system where a player will wake up prematurely if disturbed, but that doesn't stop hostile players from delivering a one hit KO, and there's an astonishingly low miss chance, defense rating and practically nulled Perception stat on sleeping characters. Additionally, even if you are awakened when attacked, you will be inflicted with the Dazed debuff, Drowsy debuff, and most likely even the Panic debuff. Not good for countering unexpected PvP. Now, some of you may argue PvPers are rare enough to not worry about it, as PvP is discouraged in most regions, but it's seriously unfair on the few players who lose their characters to Sandman kills.

Then there's the amount of time you have to spend in sleep mode. For proper prevention of Drowsy debuffs you need to spend almost one third of the time in this state. That's way too long. Since each character has a total play time limit, I think it's very unfair to take a whole third of that away. And if you choose not to sleep, the debuffs render the extra time useless anyway. Imagine if every character had 30% more total play time. You'd be able to farm 30% more money, train 30% more stats, spend 30% more time on the various other activities in the game, *per character*.

I mentioned above that the Drowsy debuffs tend to hit regions in a pattern. Most players will know the map is a sphere and night travels around it, giving sleep debuffs as it goes. Many players have though to exploit this; if you travel around the world with the day you might be able avoid the debuffs. While impractical, the devs though it necessary to prevent this anyway, so they went and added the Jetlag debuff, which as a side effect, fucks up every character who quick-travels to a new region for a couple of in-game days. I mean come on, there have to be better ways to prevent exploits than punishing every character who travels.

The sleep mechanic seriously needs to be revised as soon as possible. Maybe even removed. I see why it's there but it causes serious problems with gameplay balance."	t5_2r3f3	True

This is also true of some types of gear, such as a [[Communication Device](http://i.imgur.com/tIBfHus.jpg)]. 

In addition, on some servers, it is almost impossible to play F2P. On the American servers, it is easy to find [[Food](http://i.imgur.com/62huF1l.jpg)] and other basic necessities, but only some ways to loot these items are permitted. City Guards will still catch you for looting from shops, for example. Some players on American servers take advantage of the games settings and make it a little easier on themselves by exploiting the [[Invite a Friend](http://i.imgur.com/WjYFM0D.jpg)] program.

However, on other servers it is not possible. One may argue that on some African or Southeast Asian servers, the F2P option does not exist, there is only a free trial option, but many F2P players are forced to log off in low levels if they do not buy in.

1362085074.0	19f2g2	I'm confused by the implementation of the [Cigarette] item...	Spider_J	118	7	15	"Keep in mind, most of this was in-game long before I began playing, so I apologize if any of my information is wrong.

So, [cigarette] has been in the game since around v1830.1.1, and when it was first introduced, it was pretty well balanced.  For a reasonable fee, it provided a small 5 minute buff to [CHR] and [SOC], and increased your characters Stress Tolerance by +1 for about an hour.  However, not long after its introduction, (around v1880), players began noticing that it also applied a small stacking debuff to [STA], which, after enough stacks, could even turn into the dreaded [Cancer] debuff.  Players began datamining the code behind the [cigarette] item, confirming the debuff.

Most players still considered the trade-offs worth it, and the [cigarette] item was still wildly popular, especially near mid-game Social raids.  However, even though the debuff eventually became  widely known, the devs never addressed the issue.

Then, around patch v1975, the devs finally addressed the issue by correcting the [cigarette] tooltip, confirming that the debuff was a balance feature, not a bug.  However, around the same time they fixed the tooltip, they also (accidentally?) REMOVED the [CHR] part of the buff.  In fact, there's some speculation that it in fact applies a [CHR] DEBUFF now, making your character unpopular.

This seems completely broken to me, and the devs need to address it.

My potential solutions:

* Find a way to remove the [Cancer] debuff from the item
* Revert the [CHR] changes back to their pre-patch v1975 setting
* Remove the item from the game entirely.  Most new players are instead using the [Pot] item now, anyway (which has its own set of issues that need to be addressed, but that's another matter).

First I'd like to preface this post and say that I do like a lot about this game, and am trying not to come off like a whiner noob. But srsly, I have to question some of the design choices that the devs have made in this game, and some of the rules that the mods enforce.

First of all, the food items coming with a fat debuff. I mean seriously WTF were the devs thinking on this one? The eating food skill is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the game, but of course, if you use it on some of the best foods, you start to gain the fat debuff, and it stacks in intensity. For a little while, I started to get a couple stacks of the fat debuff, and it was really pwning my character. END and MOT (motivation) stats started dropping quickly. And it takes a lot of questing and grinding to get rid of the fat debuff, way harder than getting it. Why create good content like food if they're going to punish you for using it a lot?

Next, no respawns and horrible quest rewards in PvP. I joined the air force faction (I'm on the America server) 6 levels ago, cause they promised me gold, fun PvP, and exploration ops. But then after I already joined, I found out that the PvP servers don't have respawn, so I decided to do the air traffic control sidequest in the air force faction to lower my chances of getting killed in PvP. I figured that if I'm in a PvP server, rewards would be greater, but noooooo. I found out that people doing the ATC sidequest on regular servers were making about 2 or 3 times the gold that I was doing the same thing! Not to mention, the only exploring I got to do took me to this map called North Dakota, where there is major frost damage if you stay outside too long. There was literally no point to PvP (I couldn't get into the whole realm pride thing) so when I dinged 25 I GTFO and am back in the regular server. Unfortunately getting into the ATC guild takes a long time, so I am farming gold at a deli now.

Lastly, I want to move on from bitching at the devs and move on to bitching at the mods. They enforce the dumbest rules ever. One of my friends got banned for a little while for farming this marijuana plant. What kind of rule is that? The tooltip for the marijuana plant says it causes temporary +10 enjoyment, laughter, and munchies, with a slight temporary debuff on critical thinking. What's wrong with that, especially if it is an item that the devs specifically put in the game, unlike meth crystals or something like that that is user-created. Not that I'm for banning alcohol pots or tobacco plants, but they have much worse debuffs. I just don't get the justification.

Also, is anyone else tired of the religion expansion pack? It's content has been around since beta, and has become obsolete since the science expansion pack came out. Yet for some reason the fucking mods hold on to it and create rules in the ToS that don't make any sense now that the science questline has been playing out. I know not everyone is into lore, but it really fucks up the current questlines with it's plotholes and it's just time for it to be patched out IMO...

If you made it this far, thanks, I know bitching about the mods and devs is never going to accomplish anything, but game forums at least help you get that crap off of your mind.

TL;DR

Why fat debuff come with eating skill, PvP should have respawns and better rewards, mods ban stupid shit like farming marijuana plants (which are put in by the devs...) and the religion expansion pack is obsolete now that the science expansion pack is out, so why keep it?

Atrapenna	111	13	10	Okay I reached level 31 a couple months ago, and I realized all i do is grind for 8 hours game time and them have to rest for 10 and because of my job class I can never find anyone to party with during the other 6 hours. I tried logging in at different times but its like everyone on my friendslist is grinding when I try or already in a party with someone else and cant get free. Really wish I could reset my stats and change job class, but the gold cost is way to high and I put all of my income into food, house rent and travelling cost. They really need to fix this inflation bug, or raise the job minimum wage rates. Also, nerf the ceo NPCs they seem slightly corrupted and glitched on interaction with thier guild members.	t5_2r3f3	True

1373606926.0	1i4wja	My biggest problem with the game - I will not be able to play it long enough to explore everything.	pornpundit	113	14	10	"Usually when I play a linear FPS like Halo or Bioshock, I make it a point to explore and collect everything. It's a lot harder with open world games like GTA and Skyrim, but it's possible.

But with Outside, it is just overwhelming. There are so many places to explore that the devs painstakingly created - New Zealand, Italy, Africa, India, China, US, Brazil... and that's just scratching the surface. You could literally spend an entire in-game month in each of these places and still not finish.

Don't even get me started on what can happen if you are allowed to get out of the Earth realm. 

There are so many player created works of art, culture, literature, books, movies... Some people spend their lifetime playing just that. Some people even spend their entire time in game messing with the game's physics and learning more about its secrets.

There is so much to explore, so much to play, so much to learn. 

But alas, doing all this costs in-game credits, which are pretty hard to come by. But at one point, after you play it for a certain time, no matter how many in-game credits you have, no matter what you do, your time on the server is up and you are booted out of the server. And you can never play the game again. No mod has ever allowed the same booted player back in the game. 

While this keeps the game fresh with new players, there are sadly no veteran players in this game. We are all newbies. All of us. So for all the remaining time I have left to play this game, I'm gonna play the shit out of it. And so should you. "	t5_2r3f3	True

1359757023.0	17pxxd	[META] Welcome to all the new subscribers! I'd just like to put a few notes/thoughts out for everyone, as well as the future of this subreddit.	Liru	106	10	35	"First, I'd like to thank /u/ianm818 for plugging this subreddit in AskReddit and more than doubling the subscriber count here. Just a few days ago, this subreddit was looking to get its 2000th subscriber, and now we just past 5000 with almost no effort.

That being said, though, we need to talk. Since I wasn't really planning on such a large audience so soon, and I've been busy with life, I haven't really had time to make a rule/guideline set for /r/outside. However, since we do have a lot of new users (and submissions to go with them), I feel as though I should point something out.

As you may know from others' descriptions, this subreddit is meant to answer the question ""What if life was a multiplayer video game?"" Simple enough, but I just want to note that this is going *waaaaaaaaaaaay off base* from its semantic intention.

What this subreddit is meant to do is showcase real life, and compare things to it in video game terms.

What it's turning into is people thinking that this is a game of Dungeons and Dragons, or World of Warcraft, or GTA, and that the world is merely another map for that sort of game.

I want to point out one submission that mostly embodies what I wish for this subreddit to be: http://www.reddit.com/r/outside/comments/16glju/face_it_guys_this_games_abandoned/

Note how it's written. It refers to the world as if it was a video game. It doesn't mention perks or buffs or anything most other games have. It has a discussion regarding it being a game, as well as future prospects, possibilities, and speculation. I want this subreddit to go in that sort of direction. Not necessarily discussion-based, but more towards ""highlight stuff in life that would be amazing to have in a video game"" and not ""compare POPULARGAME to real life"".

I want this subreddit to go in a direction where /r/AskScience or /r/AskHistorians-like questions are regularly asked and answered in game terms. I want to have this subreddit show off stuff in real life that would be amazing to have in video games. I want it to show images that would make you think, ""Man, that would be AWESOME to have in a game.""

On another note, since people are joining this subreddit, I decided to start adding stuff to [the wiki](/r/outside/wiki), mostly to homogenize the ""in-game terms"" used as well as provide guidelines for submissions. If anyone has any suggestions regarding what to add, or any suggestions to implement for this subreddit, that would be great.

Upon further research I found she was using a powerful cursed buff item called meth, I think. This bug seems to get really out of hand. I once saw two screenshots in a psychology book with one character who had supposedly only grinded for four levels worth of exp, but with the help of meth looked like she was fifteen levels higher in the next screenie.

The darn thing kept on hopping around and squirming, when I finally got a hit on it it just got back up. It took me a good 20 strike and with global cooldown and how long it took me to hit that's a good half hour on a single critter.

1355034796.0	14jdh7	Does anyone else think that the economy in this game plays too big of a role?	LettersOnAScreen	80	7	10	"Okay, so this game is amazing. The world is huge, there are literally billions of players and NPCs to interact with, countless skills, etc. You couldn't possibly complete every quest even if you played through the game 1000 times. So why does the economy have to dominate all the other aspects of the game?

Honestly devs, not everyone is a power gamer. I just want to explore the world, go questing, train my skills a bit, you know... just have fun. I **don't** want to build my character just to have a strong economy, I actually want to play the game. Instead of enjoying the game though, I have to grind *constantly* just to keep my character alive. Yeah, I know I can respec into the ""homeless"" class, but then I still have to grind for food AND I lose all my charisma. What the hell guys?

Here are some suggestions to fix this problem:

1. Nerf money. I get that the economy drives a lot of the gameplay, but maybe it should be possible to get by without money so that casual gamers like me actually have a chance. Right now, you need money for pretty much everything, and all that encourages is mindless grinding.

2. Reduce the requirements for satiation. Why does the PC have to eat multiple times a day to avoid stat penalties? That literally does nothing to improve the game, it just forces the player to focus most of his/her time on getting food. Usually by grinding for currency.

3. Remove or heavily reduce the amount of sleep needed by the PC. That way at least I would ""only"" have to grind for a third of the game, instead of half.

4. Make exploring worthwhile. Do you know how many treasure chests I've found? Zero. I've explored *huge* areas, and I've never found any amount of gold or anything of significant value. It would be nice if I could find an old smuggler's cave once in a while instead of grinding every day. Why not reward the PC for playing the game the way it was meant to be played?

5. More quests! I know that almost every NPC and every other player I encounter in the world has problems they're trying to solve, but for some reason they **never** give me quests. I'm actually pretty convinced this is a bug, but I'm including it because this is one of the biggest problems with the game right now. Anyway, quests would provide the player with a way to get gold without mindless grinding.

Outside has *so* much potential. It frustrates me to no end that the devs put this much effort into the world, and yet don't seem to care at all about the gameplay. Hopefully they come to their senses and fix this issue."	t5_2r3f3	True

1373499729.0	1i1llz	Confused about US Government quest line	Weaseal	77	15	9	"So I started the *US Government* quest line a few years ago.

The first quest was pretty easy, I just had to complete *Basic Training* and then recite an oath.  The oath reads as such:
&gt; I, *playername*, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the **Constitution of the United States** against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter.


I looked into it, and apparently this **Constitution of the United States** is a *Legendary* item that has to remain intact for the success of the faction, and I am to preserve it against any players who would the break its rules.

Here's where it gets complicated.

I recently discovered through discussions with other players that the members of the *NSA* sub-faction of the *US Government* faction are actually violating a rule of the **Constitution of the United States**.  They've found an exploit where they can listen to all of your private messages in the game, and are apparently doing so fairly regularly.

The **Constitution of the United States** rule they're breaking by reading our private messages is called ""The 4th Amendment"" and it reads as such:
&gt; The right of the players to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the players or things to be seized.

I contacted a few members of the *NSA* faction to let them know they were breaking some rules.  First, they denied breaking any rules, but then said that they were allowed to under the **USA PATRIOT Act**.  However, I did a little research and the **USA PATRIOT Act** is only a *Rare* item, so the **Constitution of the United States** should override this.

I'm not sure where to go next to advance this quest line.  I'm supposed to uphold the **Constitution of the United States** but my own faction members are working against it, and don't seem interested in correcting their mistake so that I can advance in the quest line.

I'm stuck.  Any ideas?"	t5_2r3f3	True

It seems all you can do in the current version is send satellites and robots into space or or mars but there is no way of going past the edge of space. Even then, getting to the International Space Station DLC involves a lifetime of grinding or more currency than anyone actually owns.

Come on Devs stop wasting your time on gimmicky content like Beiber and One Direction that only n00b players like and reopen the moon dlc and make space travel affordable to all.

But as a human I've been able to learn about the game, and now my gameplay is constantly overshadowed by questions of how, and why are we playing, and what lies beyond.

1356151442.0	159m7l	Tutorial For OUTSIDE:MMO (WIP) (long text)	darkcohort	56	12	19	"The purpose of this tutorial is to clarify some things for new players or for people that dont really understand most/all aspects of the game.

This is a work in progress so Player (you) suggestions are always welcome.

Some other notable tutorials are the bible, Qur'an, Torah, Buddhism and many more. But like with most players they are very into the role playing aspect of this game. And a few have written fan fiction tutorials( read above).

lets start off with what OUTSIDE (from here on out known as OS) really is: OS is the largest MMO ever made. Over 7 (close to 8) billion people play this game EVERY DAY. A lot of people rage quit when they die but hey that's their business.

What makes this game so great IMO is the lack of actual ""rules"" other than physics and calculus. [Found here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics) [and here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus). There are some player made rules called ""laws"" but this depends on what faction you created your character in or joined later on.

(BTW [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) is a great source of information on some of the games past and item descriptions.) [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_world) is a brief description on what happened so far.

So this game causes as much, if not more, anger than it does enjoyment. You can't see what your stats actually are, their are no save files, no single player mode (not really), DMG takes waaaay too long to heal, emotional DMG takes longer, skills are very difficult to train, and when you hit lvl 35; your stats start do decrease! I could go on and on, but lets continue.

So your base starts are invisible but can be heavily modified by ""will"", but i know for sure this number changes often and is affected by damn near everything. The Effort and time used to learn and skill trees can be greatly reduced by utilizing Will early on.

Stats i have found so far: Will, INT, Strength, Wisdom, Speed, Language, Dex (different than speed), Resistance, stamina, patience (IMPORTANT!), charisma, Social, sex, Health, Weight, Height. (I know there is more!)

So in an Ideal build you want max of (almost) all of those but that's not possible. If given an option i'd put points into INT, PAT, LAN, SOC, and RES (For longer play time).

Early game you're pretty much forced to grind a base stat base from scratch. In most if not all of those categories. (Power through it, this is what separates low tier from high tier players!) Most of your stat developments and modifiers are based off this early game.

Controls are shit to get used to but you'll get the hang of it.

Now this game has a way of ""forcing"" you to dev certain skills as a means of success. But listen to the higher lvl players as to what to do, they've beaten those lvl's and have a good idea what to do.

So lets skip a bit because learning the game by yourself is most of the fun really.

SKILL TREES: This is a HUGE subject and i can't possible get into it all. Personally i would recommend 1 of 2 paths because they link into the job trees. The economic path or the Personal Fulfillment path. Now these are both difficult, I'll explain why.

With the economic path you have to find and train skills that are sometimes morally ""gray"" ( Unless you took a religious perk, you'll gain the label ""DICK"" and possibly go to jail by going into the black area, Don't be a dick, it ruins the game for everyone) Now this path Gains you a lot of money, but most often decreases your happiness. Some of the Higher level players said they wish they'd taken the personal fulfillment path. Does money = happiness? Sometimes. But money does = buying power.

Personal fulfillment attempts to max out your happiness, but somes times can lead to a de-buff called ""depression"" which lowers your will. When that happens your character may turn to drugs and lead to addiction. But that also happens with the economic path. (EVERYTHING IN MODERATION!). But if played right can lead to a happier life for your character. Albeit broke.

Now the skills you need for each depends on your characters base stats, current game time, financial situation, and current position in game. Good core stats are Health, Charisma, INT, WIS, SOC, and PAT. I've found that a good combo of those work fine in almost any situation so increase those and dont be a dick.

THE DEVS: Now these guys dont release ANY info to the fans. They are DICKS. They made disease, death, and a ton of other things. My character is currently experiencing some de-buffs from Bronchitis, and inflamed sciatica. I didn't think the health stat was that important, I WAS WRONG. Can't say much about the Devs because not much is known about them. Mostly fan fiction and rumors.

Diseases (from Sam_Strong): With regards to the disease debuffs, the general consensus among much of the community is that these are not specific mechanics implemented by the dev's but rathe emergent (or potentially procedurally generated) within the game world. Some, especially those with long DoT effects, seem to ignore the HP and RES stats (Such as some classes of the cancer debuff). There seems to be a semi-random chance ( that increases with level) of acquiring these. Research into the lore that deals with these debuffs, and practicing the removal spells , while time consuming, is a great way of levelling the Healer skill path, as well as giving significant boosts to the INT stat. For those who gain high enough levels, or complete the Doctor guild quest line there are even significant GP bonus.

END GAME: By this time unless your character died from any number of things (hopefully not!) and depending on your play style; you either have kids, am with someone that makes you happy,  rich, Alone, sad, happy, any number of things. Just remember that WILL and WIS should have been taken earlier to avoid any undesirable endings.

Now Every character dies (sadly) and no one is really sure what happens. But that isn't the point. And IMHO that isn't the point of the game. The point was that you accomplished what you set out to do and either you were happy doing it, or you are happy that you did it.

Now the FanFic writers may be angry with me, but Its about playing the game and having fun, Not getting a second p;ay though. If you didn't do it right the first time, you weren't going to get it the second time.

SOME ADVICE: In current game going the job path usually requires quest item 'Degree' So get one of those, even if going the fulfillment route. 

See doctor often to avoid de-buffs (worth it if you're planning on going till late game)

Don't be a dick! Its a multilayer game after all, and people will still play if after your characters death.

Rumors have it that Buddhism offers second play-though. Mostly fan fic and rumors tho. But they offer the Dont be a dick advice as well.

Thanks for reading my tutorial! and advice and changes are welcome!

The former server I had been playing on known as Africa has been suffering from a lot of issues in recent patches. The server has a major issue with lag, and it is very difficult to get anything done because of the speed decay, in certain parts of the server there are multiple disease debuffs, the updates seem to pass us by in terms of patches, which has left the game very outdated  in comparison to nearly all other servers. Also in particular certain Subservers such as the Nigeria server are plagued with very corrupt Modderators, so much so that my guild mates moved around frequently before deciding to send me to the America server. I am very happy playing the game here, and even though my former party members keep asking me to log back in there, I don't think my African account will get any play within this play time.	t5_2r3f3	True

The problem is that the cutscenes seem to be completely random. Most of the time they don't have anything to do with the quests I'm working on, even if they do feature my character. Most of the time I don't even bother watching them because they're just too weird.

And then there are the horror cutscenes. I really don't understand those. I'm not doing any of the horror questlines, so why play a horror cutscene?

Even though some of the cutscenes are pretty cool, sometimes I feel like I would rather just have a ""Tips and Tricks"" box like you see on some games, especially if they could contextualize it based on what you've been doing. That could be really helpful and might improve the overall quality of the game more than these weird non-sequitur videos.

1375066792.0	1j949m	Working with noobs gives me a new perspective	Copernicium	45	1	11	"To pick up some extra cash this summer, I've been working as a moderator to run a [science] mini-quest for level 8 through 12. I've been grinding away at the [university] quest for a while, and I'd forgotten how little you know at the early levels. The basics of [flight], [engineering], NPC development and biomes are completely new information to these players.

It's breathing new life into my enjoyment of the game. Explaining the light engine to noobs makes me realize that it's actually really simple and well-thought out. I demonstrate advanced crafting by splitting [water] into [hydrogen] and [oxygen], and it makes me want to branch out into some of the [chemistry] subquests.

And best of all, I think, I'm showing these players what sorts of things are possible in higher levels. Some of them didn't spawn in the most... convenient... places, and this is the first time they get to see how [science], and really the whole [education] set of quests can get them some really cool and useful stats. Honestly, I think some of them are convinced that I'm a representative of Deity Games, no matter how far that is from the truth.

Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that once you're in higher levels, don't completely ignore the noobs. When you spent hours trying to beat a certain boss, it can be really rewarding to help someone else with the same battle. I wouldn't have thought to try the [university] quest if some excellent moderators hadn't put me on the right track at level 10. Outside can look really scary and big when your stats are still pretty low, and I know it meant a lot to my charges to have a higher-level player come help them for a while.

There are guilds built around that idea, like Big Brothers, Scouts, Guides, Cadets, and any number based on building the [sports] stat.

* poor flocking during high server load

* [BMW] mount's seem to not have fully implemented lane targeting and calling out, though they're visually present on the mounts

* Modern mounts keep improving their [acceleration] and [top speed] stats every year, but the servers seem to be stuck on beta rules for restricting speed. Heard of a haven on a server that doesn't have an enforced [speed] max. Is that a dev thing that's going to be rolled out to other servers?

Yesterday I played with a few friends of my guild and after hours of questing they invited me to a minigame called ""party"". 

During the game my social skills were skyrocketing. I logged off afterwards and when I started playing the next day I wasn't able to quest anymore. In addition to that my Strength, intelligence, stamina and agillity was decreased. I tried to undo the effect by using my alchemy skill. I was able to get back my intelligence but the debuff is still on.

Anyone experienced something similiar or is this a bug? Really need help, I told my guild that I'm going to raid with them later tonight and my char is pretty useless right now"	t5_2r3f3	True

Fast forward to today, and we have had 24 people go to the moon, and all of them were famous celebrities in the [military] guilds. Since then we have done nothing but allow a very select numbers of people who maxed a variety of science traits go into the space zone, and even then they are only capable of using a limited number of vehicles that can't even take you to the moon, and now the developers removed the space shuttle a few patches ago, making it even harder for the few capable of going to the space zone. The mars zone is in even worse condition, with the only options is for a very few number of people who maxed science or engineering traits to play a mini-game where they drive a robot around mars.

People had told me the quest rewards for this prestige class were worth the grinding necessary to achieve them.

Now, however, I've gone past level 40, and I'm finding that the grind is getting monotonous.  Instead of finding pleasure in the quests themselves, I'm finding that I'm only doing them on autopilot for the rewards.  Now, it looks like I would need to take the second-degree [Executive] prestige to start getting the higher value quest rewards.

Unfortunately [Executive] also means that I would have to either travel to different shards or do a character transfer from the US servers to the EU servers.  Since I'm mentoring a 7th level n00b, and my primary quest partner has the [debilitating disease] debuff (which affects primarily [stamina], [balance] and [movement]), it makes it hard for me to consider that prestige class.  And, honestly, I'd rather have lower value quest rewards than continue grinding in the [Manager] or [Executive] prestige classes (I think).

Anyway, I figure that once I reach level 50, I'm probably going to be locked into whatever class I have until I'm eligible for the [Retiree] class, so if I'm going to respec, it should be now.

So, I'm thinking that I could find something in either a non-prestige class or in a slightly different skill tree.  So, I ask:

Is it possible to respec after level 40, or do I just need to suck it up and do the daily grind?"	t5_2r3f3	True

It turns out that one of the arms and hands on the model is ""withered"" (best way to describe it) and only partially usable.  

Now that I'm a much higher level, I'd like to try another model so I can access my left-side inventory without inputting complex twisting commands (this is especially miserable while travelling via mount), and also to try out some of the [Musical Instrument] skills.  It's kind of frustrating that pretty much every other player I meet in-game has a symmetrical model and full inventory and skill access.  

I'm kind of attached to this character though so if I can't get a normal model it's not like I'm going to quit Outside.  I can get to the last [Pringle] or [Pickle] food items without having to /dump the whole stack.  There *are* benefits, no matter how small.

I asked some higher level players in the chat about this back in my noob days and they said it ""builds character"".  I don't know if this means I'm going to get to reroll without starting over or what, so I'm hoping someone here has some more information on this.

Back in the day there was a really strong faction called [ROME] it had some of the highest military stats to date and some of the strongest players on its server, but what made them more unique was there decision making process. Players who hit a certain level cap and maintained their estate packs gained from being part of the beta group all voted on where to raid and what buildings to create.

Then came this one character who at a very low level cap won a huge series of raids in the [GAUL] server his name was Julius Caesar. Coming back from his victories with a [GREAT GENERAL] title as well as some personal achievements for his server such as the [GAIN PROVINCE] [DEFEAT FACTION: GAULS] and explored an unknown territory [BRITANNIA].

Unfortunately several high ranking players in the faction especially those in the [SENATE] guild decided he might be becoming OP and asked him to disband his legions and share his loot. Caesar refused and changed the way his server ran forever by marching into [ROME] and taking full voting power. He did this without causing a [RIOT] reaction by hiding his title from most of the players.

Eventually though a group of players from the [SENATE] guild attacked him when he was unarmed and didn't have a party to protect him including his [TANK] Mark Antony 

We unfortunately don't have the chat log from the famous attack, but it's been written that Caesar's last words were 'Et tu Brute?"" which means ""You to Brutus?"" as a [SENATE] guild member Brutus delivered the final blow, sadly Brutus was on Caesars friend list at the time.

I used to own the [motorcycle] item and things were better, but since then purchased a [used car] from the player AH (was worried about some horrible debuffs from the [motorcycle] item).

Anyway, it takes me about 50 minutes to get to work in the morning rush where every other player in the game is also traveling.

I was thinking of different solutions: I believe a popular feature will be the auto-travel, some kind of [teleportation] bonus to cut down travel times. I was trying to develop a flight-path for traveling but that tech tree is still ridiculously expensive for short-distance traveling. Since I was a little kid I hoped top-tier players who have mastered different sub-trees of the [science] tree will invent the [hoverboard] item.

Alas, the only option for me nowadays is this [used car] item that inflicts a horrible [air pollution] global debuff.

I understand the devs' idea of us enjoying the graphics while traveling, buy taking the same route every day has great diminishing returns on that. Hey, at least I get to enjoy the music and sound effects of the game with the [radio] item.

It appears to be a status ailment, and I can't seem to find an item to cure the condition.

At the moment I am using water potions to replenish some of the energy lost but it does not remove the condition. I have tried a level 30 salve of sun protection, this helps reduce the burn effect caused by the hot environment but not the energy leak... as this can also occur in environments with a *shade* or *indoor* modifier.

Fan item temporarily stops the energy leak but also drains battery power to use, so I can't do it indefinitely... it is a temporary fix rather than a permanent solution.

All we have in *Outside* are mounts and various expensive taxi services like the [Airplane] or [Train]. And also, those taxis are super laggy. My character has to wait hours to travel between regions, and sometimes it even takes more than one to get to a specific region.

Have you guys found the time to mess around with some of them? I mean things like Far Cry 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. They're **a lot** less feature-packed obviously since they were made by other players ingame, but they're also much more tolerant of error and you're much less likely to get RNG'd for no reason which is my #1 complaint for this game. It's way too easy to have your character get buttfucked by sheer random chance.

I think the devs are gradually trying to force players who experiment with minigames to become minigame-only characters by applying status effects to frequent players that only affect social gameplay. Stuff like CHA debuffs and cosmetic changes. Once you get started with minigames, you can either spend time training **again** to get back to where you were, or you can accept your fate and keep going.

I think they've also been applying some ""invisible"" debuffs to me as well. I've been reading about ""depression"", ""social anxiety"", and ""ADHD"" and I think they would explain a lot of what's been going on with my character lately. With my stats I shouldn't be failing as many rolls as I am. I've been playing my character for 18 years now but I've only gotten to level 13, which is weird because I think I rolled a character with high INT so I should be leveling **faster**.

And all the men and women merely players:

They have their logins and their logoffs;

And one man in his time plays many classes,

His story being seven arc. At first, the noob,

Mewling and puking in the veteran's arms.

And then the whining skill-grinder, with his inventory,

And shining morning face, creeping like mob

Unwillingly to trainer. And then the roleplayer,

Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad

Made to his mistress' eyebrow. 

Then a pvper,

Full of strange metagames and bearded like the pard,

Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,

Seeking the leaderboard reputation

Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the mentor,

In fair round belly with good capon lined,

With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,

Full of wise saws and modern instances;

And so he plays his part. 

The sixth age shifts

Into the lean and slipper'd ,

With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,

His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide

For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,

Turning again toward childish treble, pipes

And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,

That ends this strange eventful history,

Is the bittervet and mere oblivion,

Sans competing, sans crafting, sans fun, sans everything."	t5_2r3f3	True

Snoutmol	41	9	2	"When new players spawn, they come with a lot of randomized qualities. Some are short; some are tall. Some have black skin; some have white skin. And, of course, there is male and female.

These features, some more so than others, are very superficial. I've noticed in my time playing Outside, however, that a lot of player's actions and behavior are based off of these preset appearances.

For example, a large amount of females tend to act in a way that is considered ""feminine."" Males act in a way that is more ""masculine."" I don't think I've ever seen a girl say a crude joke (at least not in the presence of a male), but males do it all the time, regardless of their company.

Being born into a certain body seems to have a profound affect on the way we think and behave. Is this just roleplaying? Is is some kind of game strategy? Are players just trying to ""fit in"" with the rest of the user base?

My complaint is that some of them are way too hard with absolutely no rewards or very useless rewards. I have no motivation to complete them aside from being completionist.
And even the ''good'' rewards are sometimes lame - many other playes call you hacker or something like that when you get them. Haters.
Lastly, I really want a 100% completion, but... it's impossible. I've been doing challenges for last 19 years and still only got like 1-2% completion. It's hard to explore map (for ''World Traveler'' challenge) too - currently, I have only few percents of map explored. Anyone knows better way to explore map? Oceans are really difficult.

And bonus question: Does anyone else hate that function ''pay to win''? Some people have just too much money and with them, they can do absolutely everything. Mods should do something about this, really. I mean, shouldn't the game be same for every player?
Even the map exploring is easy for them. They just pay and teleport there with short delay (although it is a little buggy, teleport sometimes causes permaban, but only very rarely)."	t5_2r3f3	True

It turns out there are incredibly serious imbalances in this games mechanics for [Gold] accumulation, and it heavily favors Alpha and Beta players (There has never been a server wipe from the testing phases.)    
****
I have been led to believe that at this juncture in time, the only way to mitigate a mediocre or downright crappy starting roll was to engage in non-consensual PvP.    
****
It is apparently now the _only_ way you can amass large amounts of [Gold] without being forced into the [Banking], [Politics] or [Law] Crafting Skill Trees, and these professions are just not attractive to me as they all seem to be inherently unethical or Lawful/Chaotic Evil.    
****
I just wanted to warn you guys to watch yourselves out there. Unless you are traited _heavily_ into [Firearms] and equipped with at least iLvl 75 Firearms and Armor to not even bother trying the PvP.    
The high level PvPers out there will just stomp all over you, and the game rules are full corpse looting, so all your inventory is fair game and there are no respawns!    
****
Also there is this faction, the [Lawkeepers] that has been known to fairly often indiscriminately hose PvPers with lead, and they have the biggest guns, most organized manpower and are in collusion with those in the [Law] and [Legal] professions, so proceed at your own risk.    
****
I have heard talk of a group referred to as the [Military] that has even bigger guns and even Combat Mounts that no one else can acquire, and they have even more manpower than [Lawkeepers]    
****
Rumor has it that they are always looking for new members, but if you examine their guild charter and guild member obligations, it is really a terrible deal, I have no idea why anyone would want to join them.    
Be aware though that they only engage with other factions and only in Foreign Instances, and that you will not make much [Gold] there.    
****
Most of the spoils go back to the [Military] and [Politics] guilds directly, and the members often receive nothing unless they are high ranking guild officers and are willing to Fully Respec into the [Politics] Tree.

Thank you Iknorwr1te for the refinement to the rules (if you care for them)
Hmm...

take total age devide by 10 round down and add first number of age. Where first number must be between 0-9

    Lvl 21 = 21/10 + 2 = 2 +2 = 4
    Lvl 15 = 15/10 + 1 = 1 +1 = 2
    Lvl 09 = 9/10 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0
    lvl 45 = 45/10 + 4 = 8
    lvl 82 = 16
    lvl 105 =11

This way skills peaks at the 100+ while still benefitting continuing the motif that high level players must make room for the next gen. As most players peak around 70-80 this will provably be the max range of bonus.

Its been around since before the religion patch and has got to be an inside joke with the dev team.

First of all. With each time, you increase your chance of random buff removal, concentration perks start stacking up, social interaction skills start leveling up, attack skills level faster if your character is warrior class. After scanning the boards for a while, I don't think I've found a class that doesn't receive perks for playing the meditation game.

Some players even report enabling 3rd person view and sprite mode, while leaving their avatar in a still and quiet location. Log in time increases, action points regenerate faster, and some report frame rates increasing and ""bullet time"" abilities.

A lot of newer players get caught in grinding to lvl. 100 without doing too many side quests and don't believe that this gameplay mods exists. But if you ask some of the higher level players who have been login in and playing the game every day, they report a hidden class that becomes available that is a meta-class that comes with a huge Perception boost with healer type attributes, available to any class: The Bodhissatva class.

There is some speculation as to whether or not this class exists, but a lot of people report experience interacting with players of this meta-class.
