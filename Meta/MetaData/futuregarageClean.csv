hope you guys enjoy it! :)

[Additionally, list your favourite BR Mixes]	leavingforgood	52	7	106	"I only caught wind of Boiler Room in 2011, and my first ever Boiler Room mix was by Machinedrum. I was completely floored by the mix, and by the accompanying video stream of it. It seemed like an excellent idea, to broadcast and re-broadcast the mixes in video form. Seeing the mixing happen made me feel like I was there with them, or at least re-creating the moment with them. I appreciated the intimacy of the venue, in a figurative and literal sense (I mean the crowd is literally RIGHT NEXT TO the DJ. Many times I've been worried watching a mix and wondered ""What would happen if someone spilled their drink onto the equipment?"" Has that happened yet?)

Boiler Room has expanded to Australia, Berlin, Seattle and LA. And the musical landscape is so vast and always interesting and they've really achieved newfound success. With Boiler Room's growth, I'm wondering what they're doing to maintain the level of intimacy they're so known for. 

I hate to say this to avoid sounding like a 'Pitchfork hipster' or whatever but I'm very grateful that they never invite any of the typical electro-bangerzzz-dubstep-drop-bangerzzzz to pander to the mainstream. 

I'm wondering what you think about their newfound success and what new directions they're going to take on.

Additionally, here's a few of my favorite Boiler Room mixes.

I'm not gonna wrap this one in a short story so just bare with the facts and nothing more:

[Listen to this track at around 0:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AvpBWu7PKE)

**THE NEXT PART IS NSFW**

The ""Oh fuck"" part is from a porn.

1301643314.0	gg7ie	"Dear r/FutureGarage: I'm supposed to direct a music video for FaltyDL's ""The Pacifist"" and I'm a bit stuck."	mattygbd	34	2	20	"So the story is, I made a [fan video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJlo65ysj6I) for FaltyDL's remix of Scuba's track ""On Deck."" Posted it on his facebook page hoping he just wouldn't think it was total garbage and he actually contacted me to make a official video for his new album which recently came out. I was honored that he would ask.

Anyways so a couple months passed where I needed to devote time to paid projects (as there is not a budget for this video), and I think I finally stumbled into a concept that I like. Also, note that although the original video that he saw was abstract, I don't want to apply those techniques to an official release and I think my Youtube channel testifies to my abilities.

I want to tell the story of a young man who travels from the city to the country by bus/train, and along the way he disconnects from the various communication devices and networks that he is usually addicted to. It will be somewhat intercut with scenes of his friends consuming media or socializing through technology. I am personally dealing with a bit of internet overexposure recently, and I think that this could resonate with a lot of people. The look and feel would hopefully point out that, in my opinion, we are already living in a futuristic dystopia.

The song is this: [The Pacifist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HDg8BUJ1Bc) (Sorry if this is copyright violation, just putting it here for reference. Buy this album as it kicks ass!)

1365765351.0	1c772c	The State of Future Garage / UK Bass in the US... Where is the Scene?	shotgun_1P	30	1	103	"I already understand that the genre ""UK Bass"" pretty much has the answer in the name, but I want to find out if there are any people interested in this kind of music here in the states.  I'm currently living in New Jersey, which gives me easy access to shows and events in NYC, but no matter how many places I go and how many people I speak to, I have not been able to ascertain whether a scene exists here or not.  An acquaintance of mine DJ's at Webster Hall every Saturday night in southern Manhattan, playing heavy bass music while occasionally mixing Garage into his primarily Trap and Dubstep fueled sets.  Sadly, he is the only one that I know of who does this and he uses those tracks to soften the mood of the room for effect.  My immediate family lives in Houston, Texas, and out of the 4 or 5 times I have been to shows there, all I ever get is a puzzled look and an equally puzzled response.  Googling has not helped at all either.  

Am I not looking hard enough?  I understand that a place like Webster Hall frequently brings in bigger name artists whose audiences expect a mainstream sound, but I have been to plenty of ""hipster""-esque warehouse parties and dungeon-like bars throughout Brooklyn and I have still yet to hear this music anywhere.

TL;DR Please discuss the state of the Future Garage / UK Bass ""sound"" in context with the American electronic music scene.  Does a scene exist? Where is it? Where is it going? "	t5_2rwqp	True

1335188119.0	so4lr	Is there some sort of catch all subreddit for the hybrid music coming out of UK atm?	HarryBlessKnapp	26	2	56	"Lately what I'm listening to can only really be described as hyrbid. I also realise that it's not just the UK making it, but it's very UK centric.

You've got people like Royal T and the Butterz mandem making/playing very new wave instrumental grime, bordering on garage, mixed in with some outright garage tunes and future garage, along with some more traditional grime and MC's. I'm not sure if this would be considered a genre in it's own right, or if it is the beginning of a merger or what, but it's fucking awesome.

Also, you've got DJ's like Zinc &amp; Redlight, playing a lot of bass heavy house, with other house, that I don't really hear anywhere else, and you can hear it is very VERY strongly influenced by garage, jungle, DnB, etc. What's more they mix in a lot of grime/garage vocals with this basshouse (crackhouse is what Zinc calls it). Zinc dropped Ms Dynamite - ""Boo"" acapella vs Congrorock - ""Babylon"" last year at LoveBox and it fucking blew my mind. This is the other hybridisation I see atm.

Coupld of things really;

Firstly, you guys should look into these Dj's, Shows etc, I think a lot of you will like them.


Secondly, do any of you know of similar DJ's/Shows/Songs to the sort of stuff that Zinc and Redlight are playing and if there is another genre that is a good match? (And don't say fidget, can't stand it).

I'd like to think these 2 hybrids will also come together with each other and hybridise further, and I can see it happening. There is already overlap with some of the vocals and a couple of instrumentals.

Are any of you guys following these developments? Is there/Should there be a subreddit to cover this very broad general vibrancy that we have in the general urban scene in the UK atm? I see there is UKBass subreddit, but it looks dead.

The reason I ask is that because of the general lack of definition it is hard to keep track of, but IMO there is a definite trend towards hybridisation within a lot of closely related urban UK music. Outside of DnB, Dubstep, Garage and Classical Grime, I feel this kind of no-man's land could do with a place to gather/amalgamate so as to be able to keep tabs on it and help it develop and find a fan base.




**edit:** UKBASS it is. Everyone get involved, spread the word. Spoke to the only mod there, he said he'd welcome any attempt at revitalising it. He's added me as mod, and I'm gonna get this baby off the ground. We did it with [/r/grime](/r/grime) so hopefully with a bit of effort we can get a decent sub going."	t5_2rwqp	True

So congrats to **EVERYONE** and keep posting those awesome tunes :)

**In other news...**

Sorry I have not been posting but I have been really busy AFK.

One of the reasons I have not been as active is that me and [lukemcr](/user/lukemcr) basically set up a pirate radio station mid last year and that has been taking up a bit of time recently. It also has an IRC chat channel that supports all of the major electronic music sub-reddits:

[/r/electronicmusic](/r/electronicmusic)

[/r/futurebeats](/r/futurebeats)

[/r/grime](/r/grime)

[/r/dubstep](/r/dubstep)

[/r/dnb](/r/dnb)

[/r/glitch](/r/glitch)

[/r/techno](/r/trance)

[/r/psybreaks](/r/psybreaks)

[/r/techno](/r/techno)

... but to name a few...

Basically we're a nice bunch of people, we talk about music, production, styles and everything around electronic music in general. We've got professional DJ's, amateur DJ's, signed producers etc - We stream several live DJ sets pretty much every night and recently the radio went 24/7 with archives etc. We play a lot of various styles of music (you only need to refer to the list above to get a flavour etc) and of course some of us play Future Garage. So if you ever want to stop by and chat to like minded people, or hear some great new music, then we're where it's at.

You can connect with a client using: irc.emp.cx on port 6667 and join #electronic or if you're not sure WTF I am talking about you can use [this link](http://mibbit.com/?channel=%23electronic&amp;server=irc.emp.cx).

i'm a 25 y/o american guy based in stockholm. i've been following disclosure for a while and am excited to see them. i know disclosure gets pooped on here for being too mainstream, but i think this show will be a blast.

**Deadboy - Here EP**

A anthemic glide-y synth filled release with some beautiful chopped vocals and tropical feel.

Available to by on vinyl @ [Redeye](http://bit.ly/ks2H3V).

or on Digital @ [Boomkat](http://bit.ly/lA0V78)

Listen:  
[Wish U Were Here](http://youtu.be/kt7dZ6euP8Y)   
[Here 4 U](http://youtu.be/c0bjtKj7Fi4)

**Hessle Audio - 116 &amp; Rising**

This featured [last week](http://bit.ly/mewXGO) but this week saw the release of it's digital format. It comes in two parts:

[New Releases](http://bit.ly/licXzU)   
[Back Catalogue](http://bit.ly/jSOnGU)

Available straight from the source @ [Surus](http://www.surus.co.uk/hessle-audio/home.aspx)
***
**White Labels**

A huge number of quality limited stock white labels poured out this week. Including two from the NightSlugs label and a highly anticipated Objekt release.

**Kingdom / Girl Unit - Ride it Every Time / Fogs**

My favourite out of the two whites from NightSlugs this week. Expect weird as shit, ultra heavy hip/hop influenced FG. Chopped vocals and huge bass hits.

Available @ [Redeye](http://bit.ly/mK8ukI)

Listen:    
[Kingdom &amp; Girl Unit - Ride it Every Time](http://youtu.be/cAinQcYC71g)   
[Kingdom - Fogs](http://youtu.be/nkL8hCaSqtQ)    
Note: Fogs is available digitally on his release on NightSlugs last year.

**Objekt #2 - CLK Recovery / Unglued**

Another HUGE white label only release from Objekt. An instant dancefloor smasher.

Available @ [Redeye](http://bit.ly/mmo3eM)

[Listen](http://bit.ly/iNsUos)   
Note: [Unglued](http://bit.ly/fq0zaH) is ridiculous.

**Blawan - Getting Me Down**

Vocal chopped, with a dark UK garage vibe that flew off the shelves on Monday. Fortunately this is getting a repress and will be available once again very soon.

Available @ [Redeye](http://bit.ly/j4EahM)

[Listen](http://youtu.be/sIkhewd69SE)
***
This Weeks TOP PICK is....
***
**V.I.V.E.K - Eyes Down EP**

Highly anticipated weighty slab of Dubstep finally hits store shelves on Monday along with a digital release.

I can't really describe how good this is, you just have to hear the first track, ideally through something with a sub-woofer and at extreme volumes.

[LISTEN](http://youtu.be/ukgLeT1tBvI)

Available @ [Redeye](http://bit.ly/lnESqK)

and on Digital at various outlets.
***
So that's this weeks top picks. I can't apologise enough for the lack of digitally available tracks in this weeks selection, but I guess that's how it is some weeks.

As always, thanks for reading / listening. Discussion is welcome.

Much love, [Roshman](http://chococast.com)
