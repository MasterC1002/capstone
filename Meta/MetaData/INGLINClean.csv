1367016008.0	1d6mke	A tourist in London decides to skip out on his tour group and go exploring on his own.. (X-post /r/jokes)	fatalillusion	304	21	11	"He wanders around, seeing the sights, occasionally stopping at a quaint British pub to soak up the local culture, chat with the locals, and have a few pints of stout.



After a while, he finds himself in a very nice neighborhood with big, stately residences...no pubs, no stores, no restaurants, and worst of all NO PUBLIC TOILETS.



He really, really has to go, after all those drinks. He finds a narrow side street, with high walls surrounding the adjacent buildings and decides to use the wall to solve his problem.



As he is unzipping, he is tapped on the shoulder by a London police officer, who says, ""I say, sir, you simply cannot do that here, you know.""



""I'm very sorry, officer,"" replies the tourist, ""but I really, really have to go, and I just can't find a public restroom.""



""Ah, yes,"" said the policeman.""Just follow me"". He leads the tourist down a back delivery alley to a gate, which he opens.



""In there,"" points the policeman. ""Go ahead sir, anywhere you like.""



The fellow enters and finds himself in the most beautiful garden he has ever seen. Manicured grass lawns, statuary, fountains, sculptured hedges, and huge beds of gorgeous flowers, all in perfect bloom.
Since he has the policeman's blessing, he relieves himself and feels much more comfortable. 


As he goes back through the gate, he says to the police officer, ""That was really decent of you... is that what you call English hospitality?""
""No sir,"" replied the police officer, ""that is what we call the French Embassy."""	t5_2v1ve	True

1. We can talk about the Empire. The 'muricans talk about their ""FREEDOM"" and ""TEDDY ROOSEVELT"" and other such things but what do we have to mention? As simply England not much, but as Britain we can be all like ""THE EMPIRE"" and ""WE RULED ALL YOU BITCHES"", etc. 

2. We would have all the attributes of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland too, who don't have individual subreddits.

3. Use of the Union Jack, which is awesome.

4. Call ourselves 'Britons', not 'The English' - how dull.

That's it really. I just think Britain as a whole is better. I love the idea of this community and the general community of these kinds of subs. It would be fun to become competitive with the other countries and over each other's qualities and history. Maybe I just feel left out of /r/MURICA due to my British blood.

I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can civilise you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my gunboats. Not only am I extensively trained in beating the French, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Royal Air Force and I will use it to its full extent to bomb your miserable arse off the face of the continent, you little German.

The place is full of Spanish speaking fools who do not even know how to line up and have the rudest ways, I got so mad at a bunch of Spaniards for pushing in front of me in a line for a ride in Universal Studios, I began to stand behind them and breathe really heavy and 'creepily' down their necks, being about a foot taller than all of them none of them dared say anything. Tis what they get for being rude. They may have been Argentinians... also it seems to be a lot of hostility over here towards Inglin, I was walking around fine and then suddenly as soon as I wear my Union Flag t-shirt I start getting weird looks but I just go on with pride..

But anyway, we should not colonise this place, tis doomed, no chance of civilisation.

Forgive me for spelling mistakes, it's late, I'm tired and all I want to do is return to our glorious Nation.. I dream of Blighty.. Also American food is supposed to be better.. it's not, it is complete wank, I kept getting snide remarks about British food and I told them that their bread tastes like a stale baguette and their meat is just awful.. fuck this place, America is very backwards

Also their plug sockets are less powerful and look absolutely shit, no switches or style or anything.. so disappointed

Edit: I'm not trying to offend any Americans genuinely as I am just disapointed with the experience of this area - I very much want to come back but I think I'll try different states, Texas, California, New England yadda yadda :D might do a Inglin road trip - glad to see people agree.."	t5_2v1ve	True

This subreddit is a fine lady with a wart on her nose.

Can the full reddit admins change the name?

Would anyone think it was to much fuss if we just copy and pasted everything about this subreddit to one with a better name, and changed this to a redirect subreddit?

I've said it before, I think /r/rulebritannia is better. Maybe someone has another name that everyone prefers, but I couldn't think of name worse. Maybe we should have a competition to see if there's a shittier name for this wonderful place.

1366311172.0	1cmfrq	Alright chaps, here's the plan to bring some Civilisation to those ghastly Europeans	generalscruff	44	4	12	"[Thread soundtrack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XPHL4Q86t4)

Here is a plan myself and a friend in Her Majesty's Navy came up with to help bring a dose of much needed Hope and Glory to the Europeans, who we feel are getting uppity and need reminding who is boss once again. 

The first stages of the plan were concocted by our own /u/bogwood while he stood watch on the South Coast. 

1. Build a large ship canal through France [like this (credit to the aforementioned Sir)](http://i.imgur.com/1nMoZ1E.png), passing through as many major cities as possible. This will end the unemployment problem and many patriotic Britons will join the work. It will finish in Brussels, although it shall pass through Luxembourg. According to our records, they have never been Civilised

2. We send our gunboats and troop transports up to Brussels through said canal, this will also intensely Annoy The French, which is another objective. 

3. Intelligence reports that Johnny Native have formed a ""European Union"" which is based in Brussels, we shall civilise this first. 

4. Gunboats open fire and Our Brave Redcoats get out, Henry-Martini Rifles and Webleys in hands, pith helmets on heads, and promptly bring the required Hope and Glory to the area, with bagpipes, bugles and drums playing

5. With their new masters taken, we shall assume control of this ""European Union""

6. We shall issue ""directives"" mandating all the Natives and Colonials to sing God Save the Queen everyday and drink at least 3 cups of tea a day

7. Eventually, they will join the British Empire as civilised and respectable citizens"	t5_2v1ve	True

* Injuring a French Royalist Officer in a duel. (he was unharmed),

* Captured, burned  or drove ashore 53 ships,

* Capturing a French fortress in Spain, delaying an entire army by a month,

* Orchestrated the Battle of the Basque Roads, [here, wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Basque_Roads),

* Helped liberate Chile and Peru from the Spanish, in which he captured the City of Valdivia with 2 ships and 300 men. The city was incredibly well defended with ~1500 men and 100 cannon.

* He was friends with Brunel and was an accomplished engineer, co-holding the patent for the [Tunnelling shield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_shield).

He was an incredible British hero, well versed in kicking French and Spanish arse. Worthy of praise across all this fine land.

I'd like to propose a toast. 

""Death to the French!""

We didn't come up with that because we fought a bunch of pussies at Agincourt or Waterloo. Between us we owned half the world. Remember there was that small squabble called ""The great war"" when we fought as bros and won...

Not to mention the free French forces contribution to kicking the shit out of the Nazi's or being best bros in NATO during the Cold War or that were now sharing Aircraft carriers. To be honest ""The Old Foe"" is probably the best nation on earth to have our backs as we have theirs. They aren't cowards, they're the next best fucking nation to our own. Yes we have had our differences but that made us both stronger. Who would you rather (grudgingly) have at your side? A bunch of guys you have been fighting for centuries who you know will bring it or some fair weather friends who came to the party late?

Like any true Englishman i hate the French... Like they hate us but woe betide any other fucker who comes at us both.

Americans have been giggling and the way I say words. A woman asked me what I was eating and I replied 'I haven't a clue' she then went on to smile and giggle for five minutes - not entirely sure why but they seem to smile when they hear me speak.

Went to the Harry Potter themed attraction - it's quite amusing seeing these Yanks put on British accents. But my god they are literally all stunning lasses.

*We can testify to his bravery. He has borne intense suffering for weeks without complaint, and to the very last was able and willing to discuss outside subjects. He did not – would not – give up hope to the very end. He was a brave soul. This was the end. He slept through the night before last, hoping not to wake; but he woke in the morning – yesterday. It was blowing a blizzard. He said, ‘I am just going outside and may be some time.’ He went out into the blizzard and we have not seen him since.*

*I take this opportunity of saying that we have stuck to our sick companions to the last. In case of Edgar Evans, when absolutely out of food and he lay insensible, the safety of the remainder seemed to demand his abandonment, but Providence mercifully removed him at this critical moment. He died a natural death, and we did not leave him till two hours after his death.*

Between the ages of 5 and 17, it is legally permissible for children to drink alcohol at home or at a friend's house with the permission of a parent or legal guardian.[91]

The minimum age for the purchase of alcohol is 18. People aged 16 or 17 may consume wine, beer or cider on licensed premises when ordered with a meal.[1] In England and Wales, it must be an adult who orders;[92] however, an adult doesn't have to be present to order alcohol with a meal in Scotland. The legal age for the purchase of alcohol from an off-licence (store/supermarket) is 18. (The legal age to buy liqueur chocolates is 16, but this is rarely enforced.)

Under the BBPA's Challenge 21 scheme, customers attempting to buy alcoholic beverages are asked to prove their age if in the retailer's opinion they look under 21 even though the law states they must be a minimum of 18. Many supermarket and off-licence chains display Challenge 21 notices stating that they will not serve persons who look under 21 without ID.

Supermarkets or off-licence chains that are found to have violated the law and have repeatedly sold alcohol to underage persons are then required to adopt the Challenge 25 scheme. Failing to adhere to this will result in revocation of the licence to sell alcohol. (Challenge 25 is standard procedure in Scotland and the main supermarket chains.)
Purchasing alcohol on behalf of a minor is illegal in all of the United Kingdom. This means acting as the young person's agent.[93][94]"	t5_2v1ve	True

Lieutenant Terence Edward Waters GC (1 June 1929 – 22 April 1951), was a British soldier who was awarded the George Cross in recognition of gallant and distinguished services whilst a prisoner of war of North Korea, having been captured at the Battle of the Imjin River during the Korean War. He died whilst being held captive at Pyongyang, Korea.

=

**His [George Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Cross) Citation:**

""Lieutenant Terence Edward WATERS (463718) (deceased), The West Yorkshire Regiment (The Prince of Wales's Own), attached The Gloucestershire Regiment.

Lieutenant WATERS was captured subsequent to the Battle of the Imjin River, 22-25 April 1951. By this time he had sustained a serious wound in the top of the head and yet another most painful wound in the arm as a result of this action.

On the journey to Pyongyang with other captives, he set a magnificent example of courage and fortitude in remaining with wounded other ranks on the march, whom he felt it his duty to care for to the best of his ability.

Subsequently, after a journey of immense hardship and privation, the party arrived at an area west of Pyongyang adjacent to P.W. Camp 12 and known generally as ""The Caves"" in which they were held captive. They found themselves imprisoned in a tunnel driven into the side of a hill through which a stream of water flowed continuously, flooding a great deal of the floor in which were packed a great number of South Korean and European prisoners-of-war in rags, filthy, crawling with lice. In this cavern a number died daily from wounds, sickness or merely malnutrition : they fed on two small meals of boiled maize daily. Of medical attention there was none.

Lieutenant WATERS appreciated that few, if any, of his numbers would survive these conditions, in view of their weakness and the absolute lack of attention for their wounds. After a visit from a North Korean Political Officer, who attempted to persuade them to volunteer to join a prisoner-of-war group known as ""Peace Fighters"" (that is, active participants in the propaganda movement against their own side) with a promise of better food, of medical treatment and other amenities as a reward for such activity - an offer that was refused unanimously - he decided to order his men to pretend to accede to the offer in an effort to save their lives. This he did, giving the necessary instructions to the senior other rank with the party, Sergeant HOPER, that the men would go upon his order without fail.

Whilst realising that this act would save the lives of his party, he refused to go himself, aware that the task of maintaining British prestige was vested in him.

Realising that they had failed to subvert an officer with the British party, the North Koreans now made a series of concerted efforts to persuade Lieutenant WATERS to save himself by joining the camp. This he steadfastly refused to do. He died a short time after.

He was a young, inexperienced officer, comparatively recently commissioned from the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, yet he set an example of the highest gallantry."""	t5_2v1ve	True

And looking at the front page of Inglin it is indistinguishable from some nationalistic jingoistic pro Britain website. I'm not really sure if it's possible for it to be different. But I want to make sure everyone here knows that this subreddit is satirical, it's a parody. Being British is fine, we're not the best, if you genuinely think we are you are being misled.

Already, they taunt us with posts like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ameristralia/comments/1d37g6/how_it_must_feel_being_british/) and plan revolt and revenge with posts like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ameristralia/comments/1d2bqg/its_your_turn_england/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ameristralia/comments/1d22b8/i_think_this_is_completely_within_our_potential/).

I say that we do not let them *think* about such silliness. I say that we invade first, and show them our might.

The plan is simple, peaceful, and Godly.

1. Go to the new tab in /r/Ameristralia
2. Click to go to the comments of the latest post.
3. Search for the first line of Jerusalem, provided below for those Englishmen who do not know (i.e. those who suffer from brain damage)
4. If the line is there, upvote it and follow it up with the next one as a reply (and so on for each line until that Godly poetry is said in full). If not, post the first line.
5. Squash this rebellion before it begins and show these barbarians the patriotism that would see their downfall if they continue!

The lines are provided here:
&gt;And did those feet in ancient time  
Walk upon England's mountain green?  
And was the holy Lamb of God  
On England's pleasant pastures seen?  
And did the countenance divine  
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?  
And was Jerusalem builded here  
Among those dark satanic mills?  

&gt;Bring me my bow of burning gold!  
Bring me my arrows of desire!  
Bring me my spear! O clouds, unfold!  
Bring me my chariot of fire!  
I will not cease from mental fight,  
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,  
Till we have built Jerusalem  
In England's green and pleasant land.

While visiting England, George W. Bush is invited to tea with the Queen. He asks her what her leadership philosophy is. She says that it is to surround herself with intelligent people. He asks how she knows if they're intelligent.

""I do so by asking them the right questions,"" says the Queen. ""Allow me to demonstrate.""

She phones Tony Blair and says,

""Mr. Prime Minister. Please answer this question: Your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother or sister. Who is it?""

Tony Blair responds, ""It's me, ma'am.""

""Correct. Thank you and good-bye, sir,"" says the Queen. She hangs up and says, ""Did you get that, Mr. Bush?""

""Yes ma'am. Thanks a lot. I'll definitely be using that!""

Upon returning to Washington, he decides he'd better put the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to the test. He summons Jesse Helms to the White House and says, 

""Senator Helms, I wonder if you can answer a question for me.""

""Why, of course, sir. What's on your mind?""

""Uh, your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother or your sister. Who is it?""

Helms hems and haws and finally asks,

""Can I think about it and get back to you?"" 

Bush agrees, and Helms leaves. He immediately calls a meeting of other senior senators, and they puzzle over the question for several hours, but nobody can come up with an answer. Finally, in desperation, Helms calls Colin Powell at the State Department and explains his problem.

""Now look here Colin Powell, your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother, or your sister. Who is it?"" 

Powell answers immediately,

""It's me, of course, you dumb ass.""

Much relieved, Helms rushes back to the White House and exclaims,

""I know the answer, sir! I know who it is! It's Colin Powell!"" 

And Bush replies in disgust, 

""Wrong, you dumb ass, It's Tony Blair!"""	t5_2v1ve	True
1370970908.0	1g4sft	Honest Question from a Yank		9	6	17	"Was ""Inglin"" a thing before Reddit? Not the country obviously, but /r/murica is a subreddit for a type of joke that has been around since before I can remember. Even Americans who have never heard about reddit will get the joke if you put on a gruff southern accent and say 'Murica if you see a really fat person eating a hamburger with five patties or something. It is a way of parodying the overt patriotism found in some sections of society (although some of it is fairly sincere).

 I discovered /r/inglin today and maybe the humor is lost in translation, but I don't get the satirical vibes you see in /r/murica. So what is the origin of ""Inglin""? Is it something that has been around in the UK for awhile or is it mainly a response to /r/murica? I really, really don't want to start any US vs UK bullshit (we are both fucking awesome and we make a great team) I am just curious.

Thanks guys! I like this subreddit either way and I sincerely hope to visit the UK someday! Cheers dudes!
