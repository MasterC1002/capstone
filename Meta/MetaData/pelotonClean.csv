For a *currently* small sub, the level of content here is fantastic and it makes it easy for a relative newbie, like me, to understand what's going on in the race and pick up on all the sub-plots which make pro-cycling such an interesting sport.

Despite us all having our different favourite riders and teams it all stays incredibly friendly and that owes a lot to the great work from /u/TDM911 ,  /u/Schele_Sjakie ,  /u/lurkingx and our ever-present /u/PelotonMod 

I’ll certainly be following the rest of the races this year, and am already looking forward to next year’s Spring Classics! Jokes on this [sub-reddits performance aside](http://www.reddit.com/r/peloton/comments/1ijo8j/4000_subscribers_not_normal/) , I’m sure we’ll see more people joining each year and can push for even more great content.

1376165698.0	1k3tlw	Why Tour of Portugal is such a strange race (contains some spoilers)	Helders	73	3	11	"So Tour of Portugal started last wednesday with a prologue, nothing to say here.

Well, in first stage, more than 200 km and a very strong wind, Abdraimzhan Ishanov from Astana Continental decides that the breakaway won't make it. So, he stops under a bridge, eating quietly. [Yes, it happened.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3p3ST55Zzk&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Second stage was yesterday, with a third category climb as the finish. Joni Brandão (Efapel) was in the breakaway for the entire stage, and was almost caught in the end by Danail Petrov, from Caja Rural. Was the bulgarian going to win the stage? Well, no, because Joni went for the cars' deviation and threw Petrov to the ground. Well, was it intentionally because Rui Sousa is from the same team as Joni and Rui won the stage? I think nobody knows, but Brandão was trully devastated in the interview and blaming the team for pursuing him when he was alone in the front (remember there are no radios in this race). [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxA2Wn6P-20&amp;feature=player_embedded) [Pics] (https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.477940335634828.1073741840.279683355460528&amp;type=1)

And today we had a sprint stage. Alejandro Marque from OFM was in the front, but the sprinters appear from behind. Délio Fernandez from his team is coming in great speed. He realizes he is going to win. So he tries to stop to give the victory to his teammate but it is too late. Fernandez didn't celebrate the win and was in tears when was interviewed for what he had done. [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTqhG7t97h4)

Italians could say Milan-Sanremo is the most beautiful. But the hardest race of the year? With labels like “hell”, “brutal”, “hardest of the hardest”, “queen of the classics”, Paris-Roubaix is the toughest race of the year.

There can be moments when it crosses from a race to a circus event thanks to the giant cobbles, the mud and repeated mechanic failures. But there is something beautiful in the contest and watching riders ride their luck. *It’s also high entertainment on TV.*

1365428823.0	1bx0a8	Ex-doper Brian Holm: Don't you ever call us pathetic (translation in comments)	Beus	51	6	18	"This is the reason why I still love cycling despite all the doping scandals, because it really shows that doping was and is not the easy way to success.

First a bit of subtext. 

For those of you who do not know him, Brian Holm was a professional rider in the 90's. He was a domestique and never won anything worth mentioning. He has later admitted he used EPO like so many others. So basically he used doping just to keep up.

A couple of weeks ago the Danish minister of sports was quoted saying that the 90's generation of riders was sad and pathetic. 

**This was Brian Holms response in an article in a huge newspaper:**

»In our line of work we have to put up with outraged grumbles from 'middle-class whiskey mouths', when talking about the past. And we do so. For none of us riders can be proud of what we did back then, of course not. But when I get angry with her [the minister], it is because cycling in the 80s and 90s wasn't for wimps and 'sad existences', it was a sort of light version of World War II on two wheels and 23 mm rubber. And we certainly wasn’t always following the Geneva Convention, I can tell you that much. 

When we were professionals back in the 80s, it was for 9.500 euro a year. We were ignorant and naïve, but we were mainly young and wild and like everyone else our age easy to seduce. We trained seven hours a day. There was no such thing as bad weather, we drove no matter what. We lived like monks, went to bed at 22 and got up at dawn, our religion was cycling. We trained, ate, slept and lived mentally in a monastic cell. No one could dream of going to the movies during road season, we did not have sex because the physical exertion might mean that we would not be able to close the gap to the next rider in the next race. And that would be a disaster. 

The owner and team managers had total control over us. I was told that I had lose my earring and it was forbidden to have long hair and tattoos. A rider was even fired for having a goatee. If we wanted to be professional athletes, we should also look like professionals. But funny enough, it was never said that it was forbidden to use doping.

Four months after my debut I crashed in a mass sprint and got a double skull fracture, and I got committed at the hospital in Vilvoorde. Technically, I was dead, and my mother and younger brother Kelvin was sitting by the bedside, as a Catholic priest gave me the last rites. Three days after I woke up of my coma, and after five weeks I was discharged with a hospital bill of 12.000 euro, 2.500 euro more than I made in a year. The team paid the bill but only on the condition that I extended my contract for three more years.

I did not race to become a professional, but I became one. It was inevitable for us wild guys. We wanted it. And I didn’t become a professional to use doping, but it was required. We were crazy, we were bastards, we were warriors – and we did things we should not have done.

I am almost willing to swear on the bible that I have not met anyone in my time as a rider who did not take something to go faster or get help in the races. Some took a lot, most a little and a few nothing. And yes, I have heard of the riders who have explained their early goodbye to the sport with an unwillingness to use doping. But you know what - the explanation is probably that they were homesick and could not endure life in a monastery, the hard training, the pushing in the peloton, the crashes and the 130 races a year for a miserable salary. Because that was what this horrible, but also splendid, professional life had to offers us when we started.

But she [the minister] doesn’t know about that. So not her or anybody else should call us sad or pathetic. We have gone through too much shit without complaining. We were crazy, we were bastards, we were warriors.

There's a lot of people pointing fingers at Team Sky, basically saying that how Froome and Porte rode yesterday was so much better than anyone else, that they must've doped.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm all for watching cycling in a vigilant manner, we all know the history of the sport. But at this point there is **no proof whatsoever** as to whether Sky might've doped or not. I think it's important that when you think they might've doped, you phrase it in such a way that makes clear that you're suspicious, and nothing else. Unless you have actual proof, because I'm sure we'd all love to see that. I know having a bit more of a balanced opinion isn't cool on the internet, but I hope we can all try to keep this subreddit a civil place.

If you think that this attitude is akin too much to how Lance-fans defended him back in the day, realize that this is an entirely different situation. The Festina-affair happened in 1998 so everybody was well aware of EPO and its effects. At this point it's highly unlikely that any team still uses EPO in an organized manner, as it's way too risky. Some people are saying that Sky must've some kind of new doping that nobody else has found out about yet, but again, there is no proof for that.

Those are just my 2 cents, I hope we can all keep enjoying watching cycling, while also being aware that being doping might still be around."	t5_2suzs	True

The Giro d'Italia 2013 is around the corner (only 12 days left) and we thought it would be fun to make a 'team guide' as a community where we introduce the teams for the Giro d'Italia. The various well known web sites often give statistics or news but you'll rarely come across a web site that gives text info about the skills of each individual riders. So we thought why not make a guide ourselves?

---

**How does it work?** 

It's really quite simple. The mods will post one thread per team from now on until the start of the Giro. So that's 23 threads for 23 teams. In each thread we will post the selected teams along with their previous results. We will also make 9 comments in the comment section including the names of the 9 riders of the team. By replying to these comments we can gather information about *each rider individually*. So we have a little guide for every rider, which includes info like:

* What is his skillset? Strenghts? Weaknesses?
* What are his results in the past?
* What is his role in the team?
* Just basicly any info about the rider in question.

Of course general information about the team in question is also welcome. Eventually we'll have a 23-thread guide for all teams in the Giro d'Italia. We can also link back to these threads for extra info during the stages. 

---

**Team Discussion 1: Blanco Pro Cyling Team**

The first team that will be discussed is Blanco Pro Cycling. They were the first to announce their team on the [April 2nd](http://nos.nl/artikel/491195-blanco-vijf-nederlanders-in-giro.html) already.

1373137568.0	1hrf54	[Spoiler] A quick analysyis of the winners data on the final climb. Reposted from The Science of Sports Facebook page.	Quibbleknott	37	4	66	"*It is not my intenetion to cast any doubt on Chris Froomes performance today. Its just that it was a remarkble feat and performance. It completley blew my mind as I'm sure it did any one who watched the stage.*

   &gt; Three quick thoughts on ‎#Froome's performance in the ‎#TDF today:

   &gt; It was fast, very fast. The 23:14 ascent of Ax-3-Domaines puts Froome in third on the all-time list for the climb, behind only Laiseka and Armstrong in 2001. The VAM of 1715 m/h converts to a power output of 6.3 W/kg (Ferrari method) and about 6.5 W/kg with other models (CPL, rst). Very fast.

   &gt; Before today's performance is instantly condemned as proof of nefarious pharmacology in the sport, keep in mind what I've tried to emphasize many times over the last few years, which is the context of the climb and variability around performance. For example, this climb was done in Stage 12, 13 and 14 of the 2001, 2003 and 2005 Tours, respectively. The earlier placement in week 1 as the first climb of the Tour may affect performance. Also, variability in conditions (particularly wind and heat) make it impossible to make 'guilt by performance' proclamations. Let's wait to analyze the entire Tour, the collection of climbs, and then compare to history's known dopers. The problem when you get too close in is a kind of ""performance pixelation"", so step back and see the whole screen. That will happen in time.

   &gt; Having said that, what was noteworthy today were the enormous gaps created on the final climb. That's because with the exception of Froome and perhaps Porte, the rest of the peloton performed in a manner that is typical of cycling over the last few years. Their performances were consistent with post-biological passport levels, and matched or even fell short of the prediction models. It was only Froome and Sky who exceeded them. Therefore, skepticism is normal, and failing to appreciate that will come only from extreme naivety or patriotism. History has taught us the value of some healthy cynicism, and if this level continues for three weeks, it makes for an uncomfortable Tour, of that there is no doubt.

&gt;Either it is one exceptional individual, or...well, we know the rest, we have seen this movie too often in the sport.

&gt;But, this is something only time will tell, as it always does.

&gt;Ross

1371030507.0	1g6qir	2013 /r/Peloton Demographics Survey Results	PelotonMod	38	3	70	"Hi all

Thanks to everyone who filled out our /r/Peloton Demographics Survey. We had 351 responses in total, which astounded the mod team here! It's great to get an insight into who makes up /r/Peloton, so let's go through the questions one by one.

##What is your gender? 
[Results](http://i.imgur.com/gQ7kwcr.png)  
Probably not a great surprise, but 97% of us are males. I'm guessing Reddit has significantly more males than females and cycling seems to be a sport followed more by men for some reason. As a point of reference, a survey we ran over at /r/BostonCeltics had 6% females.


##What is your age? 
[Results](http://i.imgur.com/spcrKvO.png)  
Again, in what is probably very similar to Reddit's demographics overall, we have a lot of people aged in their 20's. To the three people over the age of 50, hi! Tell us about all the good old days of racing us young ones missed!

##What country do you live in currently? 
[Results](http://i.imgur.com/qWsYcYb.png)  
As Reddit is an English language site, it should come as no surprise that the four biggest countries are the US, Great Britain, Australia and Canada. Other countries in double digits are Belgium, Denmark and Norway. No French or Italian people is surprising (though I believe we have some French people out there), as is only 1 Spaniard. Having said that, we do have one person from the Basque Country and another from Catalonia. We had two other countries who are represented, but not in the list of 50 cycling nations - Finland (3) and one fellow Sigur Rós fan, from Iceland.

##Is cycling your ""favourite"" sport? 
[Results](http://i.imgur.com/eEr7iwp.png)  
Cycling is a unique sport and because of that, it seems to have a lot of extremely passionate fans. This is reflected in the fact that 68% of us consider cycling their favourite sport. This is an impressive number I think!


##What other sports do you follow regularly? 
[Results](http://i.imgur.com/awjmNMQ.png)  
We love our cycling, but we also are keen on Football (soccer), American Football and Formula 1. Other interesting things of note are the popularity of Ice Hockey (Go Bruins!) and not following sports. On the other hand, Golf seems to be far less popular than it is as a global sport in my eyes.

Of course we couldn't add every sport to the list, so the other field was well used, with the following sports being quite popular also: Alpine Skiing, Athletics, Cross Country Skiing, E-Sports, MMA, MotoGP, Nascar, Rock Climbing, Rowing, Running, Snooker, Squash and Swimming.

##What is your favourite WorldTour team or which team do you support? 
[Results](http://i.imgur.com/M0MQuBc.png)  
Is this a surprise? Or no surprise? Sky are the clear leaders and the team of their once favourite son (Cav), OPQS, is in second place. Both are hugely successful teams full of big name riders. GreenEDGE have about the same number of fans as we do Australians, which is probably no coincidence. BMC, Garmin, Radioshack and Saxo are also popular. Lampre is the only team without a fan. :( Blanco probably win the award for most liked team that only a few people voted for. They get a lot of love around here, but it didn't show in the survey. I'd also like to see the results of Radioshack's results if a certain German weren't on their team!

21% of us don't support any team in particular. A number lower than I would have expected, given the transient nature of cycling teams.

##What is your least favourite WorldTour team? 
[Results](http://i.imgur.com/4kcw0wq.png)  
Well, clearly your least favourite team is no one, as almost half of us don't have a least favourite! After that though, the winner is, again, Sky. A bit polarising are our British friends in black it seems. Other notable ""least favourites"" are Astana, Radioshack and Katusha. All three have chequered pasts, so it seems people don't forget easily!

At least one person hates every other team!

##How long have you been watching Pro Cycling regularly? 
[Results](http://i.imgur.com/s9WTCze.png)  
Almost two thirds of us have watched cycling for between 1 and 4 years. Given our average age being in the 20's, this makes sense. A rather large 16% of us have chalked up 10+ years though - wow!

##How do you usually follow races? 
[Results](http://i.imgur.com/SvhX2rK.png)  
Pirate streams beating local TV coverage? Well, considering a large number of us are from the US (where coverage is very poor) this is probably the only way some people get to watch races live. Live tickers and /r/Peloton race threads continue the internet theme of watching races. Attention race organisers - we want to watch races live!

##Do you subscribe to /r/Peloton? 
[Results](http://i.imgur.com/JviSxaL.png)  
20 people filled out the survey, but don't subscribe. I'm interested, why don't you subscribe?

##How often do you participate in a /r/Peloton Race Thread whilst watching a race? 
[Results](http://i.imgur.com/vP69r1W.png)  
More than half of our readers participate in race threads at some time, which is great! They've been growing steadily over the past year and I predict they will explode during the Tour this year.

##Do you ride a bike regularly? 
[Results](http://i.imgur.com/BXpxcdo.png)  
Only 4% of readers don't ever ride a bike. Participation in the activity itself is surely higher in cycling than most other sports, right? 20% of us even race!

So, thanks again to everyone for participating, it's been great to get to know who we are and who makes up our little community here."	t5_2suzs	True

Culture of the peloton:

* Ride predictably – keep a steady line and a steady pace. Be aware of your surroundings at all times. Stay at the back if you want to relax

* When at the front, point out obstacles in the road to the riders behind you

* Respect the yellow jersey and give him space when he moves to the front

* Don´t chase a break-away out of spite, only to defend the different jerseys or to position your rider for a stage win

Break-aways:

* Take your turn in the rotation. Don´t be a free-rider

* Don´t join a break-away on the flat stages if you´re too high in the GC, as the leading teams will reel in the break-away. Let the small teams and lower riders have their day

Attacking:

* Don´t attack when your rivals are hit by bad luck, e.g. mechanical failures

* Never attack during “bathroom breaks” or when your group is in the feed zone

* Never attack the yellow jersey on the final stage

Others:

* The GC leaders must allow other riders and teams to win stages

* Riders are allowed to ride from the peloton to visit their hometowns

* No snitching "	t5_2suzs	True

TDF was amazing.  The final stage in paris has made me want to travel to paris. Aside from asking a bunch of rookie questions about the sport, I also asked a bunch of questions about the race coverage and had my mind blown when the boys were doing laps of the Champs-elysees. They even captured slow-mo of Cav's back wheel coming off of the ground when he hit that big cobble. Awesome to see. 

I know there are other races going on this year, and I don't think I can go cold turkey after the tour. I have a couple of questions about the other races in the sport. 

* About this year's tour, the announcers kept talking about historic moments in past tours.  Would this year's tour be considered a historic tour? If so, why? 
* What other races are going on and what should I be paying attention to? What's the next big race to watch for? What will riders be focused on in the smaller races? Does placing well get them a shot to compete in bigger races? 
* How do teams decide which riders will get supported during the tour? Is it based on their performance in smaller races? If so, which races are the important ones to follow. 
* How do the grand tours rank by importance? 

Thanks, guys.

2) Pez - http://www.pezcyclingnews.com/ I just love the daily photos in their Pelopic section, especially the retro classic ones and the scenic shots.

3) Cyclingnews - http://www.cyclingnews.com/ Still my go-to site for results but aren't as good as a few years ago. Lots of recycled press releases as 'news'. Still go there everyday though!

4) Velonation - http://www.velonation.com/ Often quicker than cyclingnews with the 'news'

5) Cyclingtips - A bit too 'Australian' sometimes but some great photos and different stories.

After I ran it on /r/peloton for three hours and a few beers I had collected 1471 posts with a total of 17009 comments and all its meta information. Because reddit limits the amount of information one can request, it's not guaranteed that this is everything there is, however I'm pretty confident that this represents at least 95% of the available 'stuff'.


After this boring, but mostly automated stage comes the fun and creative part. In my case, creativity comes in unpredictable waves, so there's no point for me to just sit behind a laptop and wait for inspiration. Nevertheless I was able to mine some of the data and produce some (unsuprising) results. If anyone has some more interesting ideas what to do with this database, please let me know in the comment section!


###  &amp;nbsp;  ###


### Comment activity during the grand tours ###



Unfortunately the Giro d'Italia didn't always have a race thread for every stage. However, this year's Vuelta a España and of course the Tour de France attracted quite a bit of attention. For some reason (I haven't read the race report) stage 11 had people talking more than ever: [number of comments per stage in the Tour 2012.](http://i.imgur.com/AJD9S.png) And the grueling near vertical climb at the end of the Vuelta's stage 16 left no one speechless: [number of comments per stage in the Vuelta 2012.](http://i.imgur.com/qYrkl.png)


By the way, I never noticed the strict one week posting duty for each moderator during the tours. Now I know why there are exactly three of you.


###  &amp;nbsp;  ###


### This season's most talked about rider ###


I counted all the comments that mentioned the name of a particular rider. I used the [first 500 riders from this list](http://www.cyclingranking.com/Rankings/CurrentYear.aspx) and I figured I'd give Lance Armstrong an um.. 'honoroble' mention. I suppose the good news is that despite all the major doping scandals this year's leading actors still receive the most attention. The bad news is that my method is severely flawed: I searched for only the last name, and completely disregarding the context it is used in. So misspelled names are not counted, which I assume may put riders like Vasili Kiryienka at a severe disadvantage. However I can count on myself to restore some of the balance: from the seven times the name of the 2012 Tour winner was spelled as 'Wigg*e*ns', no less than five of them written by me.


Another problem is that a few riders share the same surname (Schleck, Sanchez), and even worse, some of them have a lastname that could easily have been used as a first name (I'm looking at you Tony Martin). But whatever, this is not /r/AskScience: [the top 20 names mentioned in comments.](http://i.imgur.com/cwYyy.png) If you're missing a name: I posted the [full list of riders here.](http://codepad.org/dPGbOxXD)


###  &amp;nbsp;  ###


### This subreddit's opinion on Jens Voigt ###


The fact that [the comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/peloton/comments/yqc0g/lance_armstrong_accepts_lifetime_ban_loss_of_tour/c5xy4jf) with the most upvotes in the history of /r/peloton is about Jens may come as no suprise. To get a feel for the healthy obsession with the German warrior, I decided to query the database for sentences that start with his name. Here is a random selection of quotes, from little Jens-facts you never knew, to spontaneous declarations of love:

###  &amp;nbsp;  ###

*""Jens. Such an infectious and positive personality.""*


*""Jensy! Turning back the clock.""*


*""Jensie. Dude's a badass of epic proportions. Nothing against Sanchez, but Jens is, well, Jens.""*


*""Jens perhaps? I think that would make the cycling world go mad!""*


*""Jens? Monster!""*


*""Jens Voigt, Phil Gilbert. They win in style...and Jens.""*


*""Jens, everyone loves Jens.""*


*""Jens Voigt is my favorite, for the same reasons everyone else likes him.""*


*""Jens eating small animals.""*


*""Jens Voigt is ready.""*


*""Jens Voigt taking the hot seat for a while with an absolutely blistering time.""*


*""Jens Voigt does not prepare for le Tour. Le Tour prepares for Jens Voigt.""*


*""Jens Voigt, no team is ever complete without Jens.""*


*""Jens. Such an infectious and positive personality.""*


*""Jens will live to 120.""*

/r/Peloton has just hit 700 subscribers and is growing quickly. The Tour de France starts in under a week and undoubtedly the number of readers will continue to increase. Thanks to everyone for posting, commenting and making this a great little community.

As subscribers to a few other sporting subreddits, we've noticed that growing subreddits can quickly spiral out of control and lose the high level of posting quality we have here. We would like to maintain this quality, so we are introducing some subreddit guidelines so everyone is on the same page with regard to what content is appropriate to post.

Our main goal is to ensure that news, results and race/team/rider discussion is at the forefront of /r/Peloton. Off-topic or low quality posts are not in the best interests of talking about this sport we love.

**Content Guidelines**

If your post is about a team, rider or race in the WorldTour (formerly Pro Tour), then post away! If it's a smaller race, but WorldTour riders are involved, that's fine too. If it's about your local cycling club, try /r/Velo. If it's about BMX racing, try /r/bmx. Mountain Bike races? /r/mtb. Cyclocross? /r/cyclocross. Finally, if it's about your bike, try /r/Bicycling. These are all fantastic subreddits and will cater to your interests.

**No Spoilers**

Cycling is an international sport and we have readers from all over the globe in different time zones. Cycling doesn't get the same sort of live coverage in some countries as Football, Basketball etc, so people often won't get to watch a race until some time after it's finished. If you want to post race results, use the following format:

    [SPOILER] Paris Roubaix Results and Discussion

or

    [SPOILER] Tour de France: Stage 4 Results and Discussion

**Unrelated Pictures**

If the content is only related to pro-cycling through association, then it's not for /r/Peloton

**""This Guy"" Posts**

For example, ""This guy was unbeatable today..."" with a link to a picture of Peter Sagan. If you want to talk about a rider, make a self post or link to an article.  And put a little thought into it.

**Mindless Self Posts**

Many posts on the same subject can flood the front page. We have race threads for all the major races of the year for discussion and there are always results posts after the race is finished. There are plenty of places to discuss each race. If you want to talk about a team, rider or situation, that's fine. Just ensure that it's not been beaten to death already!

**Memes and Rage Comics**

It's a broad category, but basically anything that adds nothing of value to /r/Peloton.

**Personal Attacks**

The subscribers on /r/Peloton have been absolutely fantastic so far. We've not once had to warn anyone for inappropriate behaviour. Whilst I hope that continues, it's still important to reiterate that no personal attacks will be tolerated. No posting of others personal information and keep any trash talking down to friendly banter. We are all fans of the sport, let's keep it friendly in here. Subjects like doping can be touchy at times, so be nice when expressing your opinions.

**Spam Filter**

Reddit has a really sensitive spam filter, so if you post something and it doesn't show up, [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fpeloton) and we will look into it. If we choose not to release the post, we'll explain why.

Thanks for reading these, hopefully straightforward and simple, guidelines. We appreciate all the members of our community here and hope to continue providing a place for worldwide cycling fans to discuss the greatest sport in the world!

P.S. A quick shout out to the folks at /r/NFL. They are apparently the gold standard for sporting subreddits and we have based our rules around theirs. They have been proven to work and we thank them for showing the way."	t5_2suzs	True

- [Stage 10](http://images2.gazzettaobjects.it/static_images/ciclismo/giroditalia/2013/tappa_dettagli_tecnici_altimetria_10.jpg?v=%3C!--%20[an%20error%20occurred%20while%20processing%20this%20directive]%20%20--%3E) First real mountain stage. Both climbs are pretty steep.
- [Stage 11](http://www.gazzetta.it/static_images/ciclismo/giroditalia/2013/tappa_dettagli_tecnici_altimetria_11.jpg?v=%3C!--%20[an%20error%20occurred%20while%20processing%20this%20directive]%20%20--%3E) Looks like the second stage that Hushovd won in the 2011 Tour.
- [Stage 12](http://www.gazzetta.it/static_images/ciclismo/giroditalia/2013/tappa_dettagli_tecnici_altimetria_12.jpg?v=%3C!--%20[an%20error%20occurred%20while%20processing%20this%20directive]%20%20--%3E) Probably a sprinters stage.
- [Stage 13](http://www.gazzetta.it/static_images/ciclismo/giroditalia/2013/tappa_dettagli_tecnici_altimetria_13.jpg?v=%3C!--%20[an%20error%20occurred%20while%20processing%20this%20directive]%20%20--%3E) Idem.

It gets really hard from now on, all stages are tough.

- [Stage 14](http://www.gazzetta.it/static_images/ciclismo/giroditalia/2013/tappa_dettagli_tecnici_altimetria_14.jpg?v=%3C!--%20[an%20error%20occurred%20while%20processing%20this%20directive]%20%20--%3E) Bith mountains are hard,[The last one is 7 km at 9% average](http://www.gazzetta.it/static_images/ciclismo/giroditalia/2013/tappa_14_S02.jpg?v=20120930135504).
- [Stage 15](http://www.gazzetta.it/static_images/ciclismo/giroditalia/2013/tappa_dettagli_tecnici_altimetria_15.jpg?v=%3C!--%20[an%20error%20occurred%20while%20processing%20this%20directive]%20%20--%3E) The newspapers were right, a finish on top of the Col du Galibier! The Col de Telégraphe is the [entree](http://www.gazzetta.it/static_images/ciclismo/giroditalia/2013/tappa_15_S02.jpg?v=20120930135550).
- [Stage 16](http://www.gazzetta.it/static_images/ciclismo/giroditalia/2013/tappa_dettagli_tecnici_altimetria_16.jpg?v=%3C!--%20[an%20error%20occurred%20while%20processing%20this%20directive]%20%20--%3E) Seems not that hard but that last climb looks pretty steep to me.
- [Stage 17](http://www.gazzetta.it/static_images/ciclismo/giroditalia/2013/tappa_dettagli_tecnici_altimetria_17.jpg?v=%3C!--%20[an%20error%20occurred%20while%20processing%20this%20directive]%20%20--%3E) Another sprinter stage, if they have not abandoned yet.
- [Stage 18](http://www.gazzetta.it/static_images/ciclismo/giroditalia/2013/tappa_dettagli_tecnici_altimetria_18.jpg?v=%3C!--%20[an%20error%20occurred%20while%20processing%20this%20directive]%20%20--%3E) a 20 km Climb Time Trial. Not that steep but long and pretty regular. I think this fits Wiggins pretty well.
- [Stage 19](http://www.gazzetta.it/static_images/ciclismo/giroditalia/2013/tappa_dettagli_tecnici_altimetria_19.jpg?v=%3C!--%20[an%20error%20occurred%20while%20processing%20this%20directive]%20%20--%3E) This stage is unbelievable. The [Passo di Gavia](http://www.gazzetta.it/static_images/ciclismo/giroditalia/2013/tappa_19_S02.jpg?v=20120930135545) and the [Passo del Stelvio](http://www.gazzetta.it/static_images/ciclismo/giroditalia/2013/tappa_19_S04.jpg?v=20120930135539) in *one* stage! And there is one more the [Val Martello Martelltal](http://www.gazzetta.it/static_images/ciclismo/giroditalia/2013/tappa_19_S06.jpg?v=20120930135534). The first two climbs are tough as hell. Together almost 40 kms at 7% minimum. They are pretty regular though. The last climb is less steep in the beginning but the last 4 kms are at something like 9%.
- [Stage 20](http://www.gazzetta.it/static_images/ciclismo/giroditalia/2013/tappa_dettagli_tecnici_altimetria_20.jpg?v=%3C!--%20[an%20error%20occurred%20while%20processing%20this%20directive]%20%20--%3E) Another killer stage! The first two mountain are average. The third is the [Passo Giau](http://www.gazzetta.it/static_images/ciclismo/giroditalia/2013/tappa_20_S02.jpg?v=20120930135529). The final climbs is the [Tre Cime Di Lavaredo](http://www.gazzetta.it/static_images/ciclismo/giroditalia/2013/tappa_20_S04.jpg?v=20120930135524). It has parts of 18% max in the end. 
- [Stage 21](http://www.gazzetta.it/static_images/ciclismo/giroditalia/2013/tappa_dettagli_tecnici_altimetria_21.jpg?v=%3C!--%20[an%20error%20occurred%20while%20processing%20this%20directive]%20%20--%3E) Traditional last stage with a circuit in Brescia.

I emailed the TdF organisers and ITV asking about watching it but they didn't reply. Thanks for any help and advice :)

Our 3 moderators do a wonderful job, they might need to edit a post once or twice but generally spot on with knowledge and insights with the sport of cycling. The survey was nice, the flares, the organised look to race threads, the constant flow of topic discussion all down to the hard work of a few folks.

Since I joined here last summer I believe we have grown from about 1800 subscribers to the present number. Despite this increase the content has not suffered, we are not plagued with trolls or diminished quality of posts. More people seem to make more valid and worth while contributions to a sport which does not always share the head lines for the right reasons.

Probably in my top 2-3 sub reddits now, I suspect our base to grow when the tour starts. Already seen Schele_Sjakie posting a few times in /r/bicycling advertising us, so make sure you do not dismiss the opinions of new comers and continue to make this the great place it is.

That is all.

Ventoux	uniballout	28	4	43	"The US broadcast had a bit of a meltdown when they saw an official Sky member hand out musette bags near the top of Mt. Ventoux. They said it was against the rules and that Sky would likely get a fine for it. But so far, I've not found any article which addresses this rule violation, if it even was one. But I'm here in the US and cycling info is a bit less easy to come by. 

Anyways, rather than debate if Froome is doping, which we can't really prove right now, why don't they talk about this. Getting a huge bag of special goodies and liquids, which we all saw on TV, could have given him a big advantage. And maybe that helped propel him to the crushing victory? 

Anyone know anything about this? Is it illegal? Are other team's pissed or even talking about it?  "	t5_2suzs	True

1360263607.0	182vl1	Hamilton (sort of) implicates Cancellara as client 'Luigi' of Fuentes	roveboat	27	1	32	"Tyler Hamilton gave [an exclusive interview](http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/exclusive-interview-tyler-hamilton) to Cycling News, in which he mentions a case from 2008 at 'a US race' where a 'prominent cyclist' told the press ‘These guys shouldn’t be at the event’ , after which they proceeded to mock him by his codename for Fuentes - Luigi - which they seemed to know about. 

Internet detective caught on rather quickly, as [this case](http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/347698/cancellara-angry-with-hamilton-sevilla-and-botero-protests.html) from 2008 Tour of California seems to match pretty closely to Hamiltons story and would mean that Luigi is in fact Fabian Cancellara. [@TheRaceRadio](https://twitter.com/TheRaceRadio/status/299501189735796737) seems convinced, although most of the hard data seems to be just speculation. Is this all just a PR stunt by Hamilton or will he keep on spilling the guts on what happened? How will Cancellara handle it? If he gets implicated, who do we really have left anymore (besides Jens)?

nb. There's also a longer article in [spanish](http://www.ciclismo2005.blogspot.fi/2013/02/hamilton-identifica-luigi.html) but my Spanish isn't up to par so I don't feel too confident quoting it. "	t5_2suzs	True
1358327008.0	16odmk	Official Reddit Fantasy League	PelotonMod	26	1	12	"***We have updated the format of the RFL, [please check it out here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/peloton/comments/17ovu8/rfl_announcement_made_some_small_changes_to_the/)***

Hi /r/peloton! We already have the [Road.cc Fantasy League](http://www.reddit.com/r/peloton/comments/16aosh/official_rpeloton_roadcc_fantasy_league/) running, but this season we have also organised our own official Reddit Fantasy League! You can participate at any time (even if you missed the first couple of races)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Which races?**

This Fantasy League will cover all World Tour Races. [This is our calendar](http://www.uci.ch/templates/BUILTIN-NOFRAMES/Template1/layout.asp?MenuId=MTYzMzQ&amp;LangId=1). 

**Edit: There will be one race outside of the World Tour and that's the World Championship Road Race.** So, there are 30 races:

* 3 Grand Tours: Giro, Tour, Vuelta.
* 12 Stage Races, such as: Tour Down Under, Paris-Nice, Tirreno, Tour de Suisse, etc.
* 5 Monuments: Milan-San Remo, de Ronde, Paris-Roubaix, Liege-Bastogne-Liege and the Il Lombardia.
* 9 Additional one-day races such as: Amstel Gold Race, E3 Prijs, La Fleche Wallone, Quebec and Montreal.
* And the World Championship Road Race.

So this is a pretty diverse race calendar. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**How does it work?**

You pick 8 riders who *you* think will be the first 8 riders in the race. You can earn points if one of your riders finishes in the top ten. In stages races, only the General Classification will count, that means no points for the individual stages and other classifications. So you can score as many points for the entire Tour de France as for the Vattenfall Cyclassics. So every race is important!

The points awarded to the 1st - 10th placed riders are:

* No. 1 – 15 points
* No. 2 – 12 points
* No. 3 – 10 points
* No. 4 – 8 points
* No. 5 – 6 points
* No. 6 – 5 points
* No. 7 – 4 points
* No. 8 – 3 points
* No. 9 – 2 points
* No. 10 – 1 point

All users will have to submit their predictions like this:

* (x2.0) Rider 1
* (x1.8) Rider 2
* (x1.6) Rider 3
* (x1.4) Rider 4
* (x1.2) Rider 5
* (x1.0) Rider 6
* (x1.0) Rider 7
* (x1.0) Rider 8

***Please arrange your comments like the list above (you can make bullets with the * key) and also include the first name of the rider!***

As you can see you can earn a multiplier by ranking the riders correctly. If you think Fabian Cancellara is going to win the race, you must put him on the highest slot (x2.0), so you can earn as much points as possible with Cancellara. If your prediction is right and Cancellara wins you'll get 15 points (for 1st place) x 2.0 (multiplier) = 30 points. But if he finishes 6th, you'll get 5 points (for 6th place) x 2.0 = 10 points for that rider. So you don't have to just name 8 riders, you also have to rank them to get as many points as possible. Also note that you earn points for every rider you submit!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example?**

An imaginary results of Paris-Roubaix:

1. Jens Voigt (15 points)
2. Fabian Cancellara (12 points)
3. Tom Boonen (10 points)
4. Bjorn Leukemans (8 points)
5. Lars Boom (6 points)
6. Juan Antonio Flecha (5 points)
7. John Degenkolb (4 points)
8. Tom Veelers (3 points)
9. Sebastian Turgot (2 points)
10. Alessandro Ballan (1 point)

My imaginary submitted list for this race:

* (x2.0) Lars Boom
* (x1.8) Tom Boonen
* (x1.6) Fabian Cancellara
* (x1.4) Sep Vanmarcke
* (x1.2) Filippo Pozzato
* (x1.0) Alessandro Ballan
* (x1.0) Bjorn Leukemans
* (x1.0) Stijn Devolder

My score would be:

* 2.0 x 6 = 12 points for Lars Boom
* 1.8 x 10 = 18 points for Tom Boonen
* 1.6 x 12 = 19.2 for Fabian Cancellara
* 1.0 x 1 = 1 point for Alessandro Ballan
* 1.0 x 8 = 8 points for Bjorn Leukemans

My final score for this race would be 58.2 points. Not too shabby, but my score would be higher if I would have included Jens Voigt and if would have ranked Cancellara and Leukemans higher. Btw the highest possible score is 101 points.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Deadlines and Classifications**

There will be a predictions thread posted about 2/3 days prior to the race. You can submit your predictions there. Generally, the deadline will be around 1 to 3 hours prior to the start of the race, the exact deadline will be noted in the thread. We will copy the thread on the deadline, so the comments will be safe with us. We will calculate the scores after each race and a provisional classification will be posted on /R/Peloton. There are no prizes (yet), we are still thinking about that one.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first race of the season is the Tour Down Under (22th January). The first predictions thread will posted 2/3 days before the race. 

If you have any questions, please ask us!

Do we get a showdown amongst the GC candidates or will they sit tight? Normally a grand tour prompts conservatism but this Giro is doing the opposite and on such steep slopes it’s inevitable that the “fight for pink” sees many going into the red - [by Inrng](http://inrng.com/2013/05/preview-giro-stage-10/).

Just like when I was a little kid watching wrestling I ignored people telling me it was fake until I was old enough to realize, I've ignored doping and enjoyed the spectacle. But with the Lance article I have been reading a up a bit.

Reading the reasoned decision I've realized how systematic the doping was and am questioning whether it isn't still the case. With Contodor and F Schleck cases I question whether all the other riders on their teams (and others) are still doping, perhaps in new ways. It seems the UCI has no motivation for exposing doping. So I was just hoping someone more informed on the topic could explain to me why it is assumed there is less doping today? There are plenty of dopers still riding and working for pro teams today so it seems to me it may still be just as prevalent."	t5_2suzs	True

1372894712.0	1hln5b	Women's cycling	Imascotsman	26	4	12	"Now since this subreddit is receiving so much attention due to Le Tour being on, I thought I would make a post about our wonderful sports gender divide.

So I am chatting on facebook to a female cycling friend, I ask her if she has seen any of the Giro Rosa and her reply is no. She doesn't know where to watch it. For those who don't know this is the biggest stage race in womens cycling. It is an 8 stage race taking part in Italy in late June and early July. In previous years it was 9-10 stages and went under different names. Organisers pulling out and the uncertain future of the event this year ended up in a shortened event under the new Giro Rosa name.

It is now the ONLY grand tour in womens pro road cycling.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giro_d'Italia_Femminile

We offer no coverage of it on /r/peloton yet in the survery I remember reading that we do have some women who frequent the sub. This does not necessarily mean they want to follow womens cycling but it is not like we offer folks an opportunity. The reason for this could be the abysmal coverage the organiser provides, a twitter feed all in Italian with links to highlights per stage that are regional locked due to copyright issues. This is so harmful for the scene that online clips are restricted when no live racing is shown on tv or highlights here in the UK. The official website is not much better, again all in Italian with a poor layout, I struggle to find the General Classification on it let alone who is taking part.

https://twitter.com/girorosa2013

http://www.girorosa.it/

The UK has a team taking part in the shape of WiggleHonda. This team has the backing of the Bradley Wiggins foundation and he has stated in numerous interviews how he would love to improve womens cycling to try and get some parity with the men in terms of exposure, money ,races, development etc. If he had a Twitter and promoted it think of the exposure, or what about a link on his foundation website. Oh nevermind.

http://www.bradleywigginsfoundation.org/


To be fair to WiggleHonda they atleast provided a stage summary on their website, I looked for a rider blog update but alas some in Italian, some dating back to december and there the information trail ran dry.
Still not sure on how many teams, what riders etc are in the event.

http://wigglehonda.com/giorgia-bronzini-sprints-to-victory-in-giro-rosa-stage-two/

How are we supposed to inspire young women to take up cycling when the female side of the road scene is so over looked. 40 years ago womens tennis was in a similar position, the women locked themselves in a hotel room prior to Wimbledon and didn't leave until they had formed the WTA. Now they have almost equal prize money and tv coverage, house hold names, and MOST importantly events that run in parallel with the men.

If the ASO ran a female tour that say started in Nice on stage 4 and ran until the following weekend using slightly shortened or altered stages from the men but the same finish it would be a huge advance for the sport. The increased advertising exposure and undoubted new interest in the sport from a lot more women must be appealing to advertisers. When Rabobank pull out of the mens team but keep the womens going partly down to Marianne Vos then at least that is a small recognition for just how talented, exciting and entertaining to watch.

Not sure how to end this rant / rage piece thrown together in haste while thoughts still lingered within my head. I just hope Brian Cookson or Pat McQaid get things moving in the right direction as it has been looking bad for a long long time.

&gt; His team has anounced today that Boonen will participate at the olympics this saterday. He broke his rib in the Tour of Poland and obviously his participation was in doubt. after a short period of rest he tested himself in the Tour of Wallonia, with succes.

From an interview also on [sporza.be](http://www.sporza.be/cm/sporza/videozone/MG_sportnieuws/MG_wielrennen/1.1377783)

When asked about how he feels :
&gt;it's not perfect obviously, but *my legs aren't bad*. When i'm *sitting down* i don't feel a thing, but when ""standing on the pedals* or going ophill i have to take it easy a bit. but i don't expect a one day race, like saterday, to be a problem. I'm just going to take it easy these last few days and i'll be fine on saterday.

sorry about my translation again, if anyone knows these cycling terms in english i'd love to hear about them :)"	t5_2suzs	True

But the stage will start fast as an early breakaway attempts to get away. Like an old restaurant with a famous dish, this is classic stage in the Pyrenees that serves up a fixed menu with the unmissable Col du Tourmalet as the pièce de résistance. The Pyrenees are much smaller than the Alps and the Tour always returns to the same climbs but that doesn’t make them any easier. The final climb offers a 10% gradient in the last kilometre, the chance to jump away and descend to the stage win.(Coefficient 4)

The race reaches the Alps and this stage has barely a moment of flat road, in fact the organisers have engineered some extra riding between the Col de la Madeleine and the Col du Glandon in order to increase the distance and create space for the intermediate sprint. Otherwise the profile has the shape of a worn saw blade and the repetition of climbs before the finish should force a selection. Note the short distance, this could tempt some try their luck well before the final climb to La Toussuire.

This final climb is short but steep, it averages 8.5% and has sections at 13%. Expect teams to drive a fierce pace before this climb, the approach will be very tactical and then the leaders will take over. The time gaps might be small at the finish line but we can begin to extrapolate them for the rest of the race.

1340332429.0	vezcu	r/Pelotons Tour de France Fantasy Competitions! Enter Now!	lurkingx	22	2	38	"Hey guys

With the Tour de France just around the corner, it's time for us to open up our Fantasy Competitions! We're going to try something a bit different with the Tour de France and actually have two competitions running, one with Velogames and one with road.cc. Feel free to join both of our leagues or just one, whatever you prefer! For anyone who is new to this, i'd start out with the Velogames competition, as going through transfers every day can get a bit confusing and overwhelming! If you could, try make your account names close to your reddit names so we know who you are!

#**Velogames Fantasy Competition**

For those that haven't played Velogames before, it's a similar concept to fantasy football. You pick your riders and they score points based on a bunch of different metrics. You may make unlimited changes to your team until the entry deadline of 14:00 CEST on Saturday 30th June. Once the race starts, there are no transfers, so you won't be able to change your team again throughout the race. Your picks must include the following:

* 2 All-Rounders
* 2 Climbers
* 1 Sprinter
* 3 Domestiques
* 1 Wild Card

The rules and scoring system can be found [Here](http://www.velogames.com/tdf/rules.php)

You can sign up here: [Velogames Fantasy Tour de France](http://www.velogames.com/tdf/index.php)

The Reddit league is: [22022638](http://www.velogames.com/tdf/leaguescores.php?league=22022638)


#**Road.CC Fantasy Competition**

The road.cc league is a bit different to the Velogames league. Once again, you may make unlimited changes to your team until 14:00 CEST on Saturday 30th June. However, with road.cc you can make two free transfers between each stage. This means you're picking your team for the stage, not the entire Tour. The key to doing well is thinking ahead, with only two transfers a day you have to know the upcoming stages and choose your riders accordingly! I'd strongly suggest reading the rules i'll link below to understand how the road.cc league works if you're unfamiliar with it. With road.cc, your picks must include the following:


* 4 Star Riders (General Classification Riders, Sprinters, Climbers, All Rounders)
* 5 Domestiques


The rules and scoring system can be found [Here](http://fantasy.road.cc/howto)

You can sign up here: [Road.CC Fantasy Tour de France](http://fantasy.road.cc/)

The Reddit league is: [75917  - This will be the official reddit league for us from now on!](http://fantasy.road.cc/leagues?action=show&amp;lid=75917)

We've had to remove a few posts today after complaints about spoilers. We have rules around this for a good reason, not everyone can watch races live and people often rely on replays and recordings.

Please take a moment to read our [Posting Guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/peloton/comments/vnj0s/rpeloton_posting_guidelines_please_read/), in particular:

&gt; **No Spoilers** Cycling is an international sport and we have readers from all over the globe in different time zones. Cycling doesn't get the same sort of live coverage in some countries as Football, Basketball etc, so people often won't get to watch a race until some time after it's finished.

Please don't mention the result, if a rider is dropped or gained time on rivals or if a team took significant advantage. All of these are spoilers. Normally this isn't a big issue, as stages don't have that many narratives at once, so please keep it in mind for the next exciting stage.

Perhaps post videos, GIFs and pictures in the race results thread instead? They are a place where any and all spoilers are allowed.

1373052229.0	1hpgkq	Hey r/peleton, I'm new to the sport of cycling. I have a couple of questions about TDF.	krinklekut	30	8	42	"* There seem to be a lot of crashes.  Are there more crashes than normal this year, or is this pretty standard? 
* Do the race organizers try to make each stage technical in order to push the action for the audience?  Could this be a reason for the crashes? 
* In the first couple of stages, the announcers couldn't stop talking about Chris Froome. When should we expect him to start winning stages? It's odd that he's the favorite, but isn't very high in the overall rankings.
* how do points come into play? I'm watching stage 6 and Sagan is the point leader.  If he keeps the green jersey, will that affect his overall standing? Will he be given a time bonus or something? 
* How is simon Gerrans still wearing the yellow jersey after failing to place in stage 5? Was he really that far ahead on time?

EDIT: Thanks for all the info so far, guys.  Just a couple more things on my mind now. 

* In the TTT, do the same time rules appy?  Is the time counted when the first member of each time crosses the line? or the last? 
* I noticed in the TTT that team sky had a rider who had to drop back (I think it was Geraint Thomas) yet they were still allowed to finish the stage.  Is this simply because having one less rider to work at the front is a disadvantage? In other words, the race does not require every member of the team to cross the line? "	t5_2suzs	True

1372327785.0	1h6570	/r/Peloton collective Tour de France overall top 10 prediction	radlibox	22	0	23	"I was having a look at everyone's predictions in the [/r/peloton TDF fantasy league] (http://www.reddit.com/r/peloton/comments/1h3q2v/rfl_tour_de_france_predictions_deadline_is_june/) and got to wondering what our collective predictions for the overall top 10 would be if I aggregated everyone's picks. So I put them all in a spreadsheet and used a [Borda count](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count) method to put them together, and here is the result!


*****
  
  
###Overall Top 10 prediction:
  
|Rank      | Rider        | Proportion of points     |
|:-------:|:----------|:---------------|
|1| Chris Froome | ----------------------|
|2| Alberto Contador | ------------------ |
|3| Joaquim Rodriguez | ----------- |
|4| Richie Porte | ----------- |
|5| Alejandro Valverde | ---------- |
|6| Tejay van Garderen | -------|
|7| Cadel Evans | ----- |
|8| Nairo Quintana | ---- |
|9| Ryder Hesjedal | --|
|10| Jurgen van den Broeck | --|

  
  
*****
  
In order to to do this I've made an assumption about how people have made their picks in the fantasy league - namely that they've made their picks (including the last 3 which have an equal multiplier) in the order they think riders will finish. If I don't make that assumption about the last three (so only use the top 5 picks) there's only one change - Pierre Rolland (who is 12th in the original table) becomes equal 9th, and van den Broeck drops to 11th.  
  
  
*****
  
This has everyone who has made a prediction in the RFL thread as of about ~~11am~~ 12.30pm UK time. I'll keep checking it sporadically and update it with any other predictions!

I've just implemented a new flair system here on /r/Peloton which gives you some new choices, tidies up some old issues, makes things look nicer (hopefully!) and introduces a cool new feature! Here's a summary:

* We now have jersey flair! Select the jersey of your favourite WorldTour team instead of a country flag
* Country flags are now bigger and hopefully, prettier. The main reason for the size increase is so they didn't look silly next to the larger jerseys
* I have removed a lot of countries from the selection panel to make it easier to find the one you want
* We now have trophy/award jerseys for the leaders of our various fantasy comps. Keep an eye out for them!
* Flair should be easier to add from now on, so hopefully new teams will be added quickly

The changes were quite large and I had to redo a lot of flair assignments. If I have changed yours - I apologise. You can select a new flair from the sidebar on the right.

If a country you would like to assign is not there, just ask me and I'll add it. I removed a lot of smaller nations (pacific islands etc), many African nations and countries that don't have much to do with cycling. I hope I haven't removed any that people want, but if I have, it's easy for me to add them back.

The team jerseys are only WorldTour teams for now. Getting the jerseys was difficult and if I extended further than WT, I didn't know how far to go. I might be able to be convinced to add some larger Conti teams though. I do feel sad that Europcar aren't there.....

The main page no longer has flair shown. This is the start at an attempt to declutter the main page. There should be more coming on this in the near future. If you see any other things that have broken when I made these changes, let me know.

I think that's about it. If you are a graphic design guru (which I most certainly am not!) and wish to help make some of the jerseys etc look nicer, I'm all ears!

Thanks for reading and if you have any issues, please leave a comment here."	t5_2suzs	True

To go into more depth:

* At the end of the Prologue we had them saying Cadel did well to keep within 10 seconds of Wiggins and how Wiggins is at a disadvantage because he'll take yellow and it'll force the team to work harder than they want to.
* In the first few stages we had reports on how perfect BMC is doing in keeping at the front of the race and how Sky is doing poorly with team infighting and keep getting involved in accidents and riding too far back.
* When Sivtsov went down it was all about how much this'll hurt Wiggins in the mountains and how this helps Cadel.
* Reports on how Sky is conflicted with Cavendish racing for stage wins and how much it hurts Wiggins' chances.
* After the first mountain stage it was all about how well Cadel did to keep with the Sky onslaught and all about how well Porte / Rodgers did in keeping the pace high. (Froome as well for the stage win)

It's pretty stunning how one-eyed it can be down here while they're trying to say they're completely unbiased. We went into the event with it almost being 75% certain that Cadel would win. It'll be interesting tonight how they'll try to spin it if Wiggins ends up 60+ seconds infront after the Time Trial.


It's also hilarious how much the non-cycling-centric media keep reporting Cadel as ""rising up the leaderboard"" when he's just kept pace and everyone else has fallen away as they're not GC contenders.

So how is it in the UK, all pro-Wiggins? And for the US/French/etc people, how is it being reported over there and which racer do they seem to favour for the victory?"	t5_2suzs	True

Since the success at the Giro, we've decided to go ahead and keep the IRC channel running. We previously were using ##peloton as a channel which caused some confusion when people were trying to join. With the decision to continue with the channel and the Tour de France approaching, we've decided to switch to #peloton from now on. 

If you're new to IRC, it's basically a chat channel. You just click the link, put in your username then click start and you're done! It's a great way to communicate with everyone outside of race and discussion threads with other people who love the world of the pro peloton.

We'll have a link to our channel on the sidebar from now on. Feel free to join the channel whenever, hopefully over not only will the channel be active during races but we'll have a community to talk to at all times!

But it’s no exhibition race, many riders will be sprinting for the stage win and the leader’s jersey that awaits.

A late change to the route means the opening stage is not the planned 10 laps of Naples, instead the opening stage of the Giro features just four laps of a long circuit with a climb before switching to a shorter circuit up and down the water front.  The climb is wide and partially shaded by pine trees and not steep.

The third Grand Tour of the year is almost here, so it's time for our Vuelta a España fantasy competition.

#**Velogames Fantasy Competition**

For those that haven't played Velogames before, it's a similar concept to fantasy football. You pick your riders and they score points based on a bunch of different metrics. You may make unlimited changes to your team until the entry deadline of 19:00 CEST on Saturday 18th August. Once the race starts, there are no transfers, so you won't be able to change your team again throughout the race. Your picks must include the following:

* 2 All-Rounders
* 2 Climbers
* 1 Sprinter
* 3 Domestiques
* 1 Wild Card

The rules and scoring system can be found [Here](http://www.velogames.com/vae/rules.php)

You can sign up here: [Velogames Fantasy Vuelta a España](http://www.velogames.com/vae/index.php)

The Reddit league is: [13073422](http://www.velogames.com/vae/leaguescores.php?league=13073422)


#**Road.CC Fantasy Competition**

The road.cc league is a bit different to the Velogames league. Once again, you may make unlimited changes to your team until 13:35 CEST on Saturday 18th August. However, with road.cc you can make two free transfers between each stage. This means you're picking your team for the stage, not the entire Tour. The key to doing well is thinking ahead, with only two transfers a day you have to know the upcoming stages and choose your riders accordingly! I'd strongly suggest reading the rules i'll link below to understand how the road.cc league works if you're unfamiliar with it. With road.cc, your picks must include the following:


* 4 Star Riders (General Classification Riders, Sprinters, Climbers, All Rounders)
* 5 Domestiques


The rules and scoring system can be found [Here](http://fantasy.road.cc/howto)

You can sign up here: [Road.CC Fantasy Vuelta a España](http://fantasy.road.cc/)

The Reddit league is: [75917](http://fantasy.road.cc/leagues?action=show&amp;lid=75917)

This isn’t a summit finish but it does gain altitude fast and there’s only a short descent to the finish.

It offers another chance for exciting racing although yesterday’s frantic action is unlikely to be repeated because the roads are more straightforward - [by Inrng.com](http://inrng.com/2013/05/preview-giro-stage-4/).

In an ideal world, I'd love a Boonen and Gilbert double attack around mid-way through the Box Hill laps. Cancellara and Sagan (possibly also Gerrans and Bauer?) to jump across before bombing it to the finish, where Cancellara jumps again with about 1km to go, taking the win.

With sky down to 8 riders I think Cav will finish the tour if only because a tiny domestique contribution from him will be valuable to Sky. Having their best 5 going strong to the climbs is crucial. EBH gets the speed up, the rest keep it. Knees can't play that role, nor can Bernie or Cav.

It must be a team thing on all levels. Even adding 1% to a Sky TDF victory is important to Cav and he won't quit in the WC jersey when it comes to the sprint on the Champs.

My respect for him increases every day he struggles over the hills this year. If he gives up I would be very surprised - this is not a man worrying about his form or the rest his rivals might be enjoying"	t5_2suzs	True

The route takes in several climbs in the Jura mountains, including the oddly named Côte du Passage de la Douleur or “Hill of the Pain Passage”. It’s possible the yellow jersey contenders face a stressful day. The route is ideal terrain for a breakaway and one or two outsiders for the overall might try their luck. But if this one has “breakaway” written on it, everyone will know this and if half the bunch is trying to get away it makes it even harder for all.

Things start easy enough as the race heads west across the cobbled landscape of Paris-Roubaix but not its roads. Instead the tactical part comes at the end of the stage when the race twists and turns close to the coast. If the wind is blowing the bunch could be split into pieces, if not the hills will do damage as well before a final uphill finish in the port city of Boulogne with 700m at 7.4%.

Finally, it's here! The Velogames Giro d'Italia Fantasy Competition! After the excitement of the Fantasy Classics, it's not time to sink out teeth into a Grand Tour.

For those that haven't played Velogames before, it's a similar concept to fantasy football. You pick your riders and they score points based on a bunch of different metrics. The competition starts this weekend with stage 1 and runs for three weeks.

It's a little different to the Spring Classics in that you pick your team once and there are no transfers. Also, you must pick the following:

* 2 All-Rounders
* 2 Climbers
* 1 Sprinter
* 3 Domestiques
* 1 Wild Card

You can sign up here: [Velogames Fantasy Giro d'Italia](http://www.velogames.com/gdi12index.php)

Hope to see you all soon!

With the Vuelta a España just around the corner, it's time for us to open up our Velogames Fantasy Competition league!

For those that haven't played Velogames before, it's a similar concept to fantasy football. You pick your riders and they score points based on a bunch of different metrics. You may make unlimited changes to your team until the entry deadline of 18:30 CEST, 2:30 AEST, 9:30 PDT, 12:30 EST, 4:30 GMT on Saturday 24th August 2013. Once the race starts, there are no transfers, so you won't be able to change your team again throughout the race. Your picks must include the following:

* 2 All-Rounders
* 2 Climbers
* 1 Sprinter
* 3 Domestiques
* 1 Wild Card

The rules and scoring system can be found [here](http://www.velogames.com/vuelta-a-espana/2013/rules.php)

You can sign up here: [Velogames Fantasy Vuelta a España](http://www.velogames.com/vuelta-a-espana/2013/index.php)

The Reddit league is: [20012750](http://www.velogames.com/vuelta-a-espana/2013/leaguescores.php?league=20012750)

Last years standings looked like [this](http://www.velogames.com/vae/leaguescores.php?league=13073422). We had 72 entries at the Vuelta last year - let's see if we can beat that.

Keep an eye out for a post about how to select the best team, who is good value and who you should stay clear of. It will appear in the coming days.

A quick note:

**PLEASE USE YOUR REDDIT USERNAME AS YOUR USERNAME/MANAGER NAME**

You can give your team any name, but if you user your reddit username as the manager name, we can easily track who is winning and award the flair appropriately.

Problem is, I need a team to root for! So I am just wondering, who do you root for and why do you do it?

**Edit:** Wow. This thread is fantastic! Some really interesting answers. After reading through everything I think during Le Tour I am going to root mainly for Garmin-Sharp for two main reasons: they are an American team, and blue argyle is classy as fuck.

But beyond that I like the idea of rooting for individual riders too. I'll just watch the races more closely and see who really impresses me. I have not been looking too specifically at riders, I should though.

Oh yeah, and I'll obviously be rooting for motherfucking Jens Voigt."	t5_2suzs	True

1357127723.0	15tm0g	Race Report - Mitchelton Bay Cycling Classic 2013	tdm911	16	1	7	"Hi all. You've probably heard me banging on about being excited to watch the first race of the year, the Mitchelton Bay Cycling Classic. The first stage is in my home town of Geelong, so it's well worth venturing out with a New Years hangover to watch Australia's best domestic racers battle it out with some seasoned international pro's.

The first stage is a ""hot dog course"", which is basically two straights of about 250m in length and a couple of sharp corners joining them. It's fast and frantic from the start and the race lasts only an hour.

Orica-GreenEDGE were the only WorldTour team present, however quite a few well known riders rode for local teams, including Steele Van Hoff (Garmin), Greg Henderson (Lotto), Koen De Kort (Argos-Shimano) and Jonathon Cantwell (Saxo).

From the start, Greg Henderson attacked and effortlessly kept the peloton away for many laps. Eventually they got organised though with some long pulls by the OGE boys and he was bought back. It was an odd move by the defending champ, but he mustn't have had the legs for a sprint win, as he attacked later again, without any luck again.

Riders kept being lapped as the race went on and eventually the peloton whittled down to about 20 or so riders. Jens Mouris of GreenEDGE and Tom Scully of Grey's Online attacked with about 10 laps to go and looked to have the race won with 2 laps remaining, however Mouris wasn't taking turns and Scully started to angrily wave him through and that finished them. I'm assuming Mouris was riding for Howard in this case.

The sprint was pretty easy for Caleb Ewan in the end as he easily powered past a tiring Mouris and Scully. Keep the name Caleb Ewan in your mind, because you will hear more about him in the next few years. He won two stages of this race last year and has one this year, whilst being only 19 years old. He looks to have a bright future indeed.

1. Caleb Ewan
2. Jens Mouris
3. Tom Scully

TheNoveltyAccountant	32	15	36	"For years i have always championed that drugs have no place in sport because it doesn't create a level playing field. Now that i think about though, that argument doesn't seem to hold sway when we talk about genetics and why people are elite.

Certain genetic traits make people more able to be champions, (e.g. how many white people win the 100m sprint), therefore we are already starting with a playing field that is inherently not level.

There's always been the argument of what's more valuable out of pure talent and hard work. Why can't we also include what's more valuable - genetics or receptiveness to drugs?

What does it mean to be an elite athlete, in a sense training provides advantage and people respond differently to training as well so training doesn't even the playing field. Similarly with drugs.

Provided there are no detrimental health effects of taking drugs, why are they so bad? Could drugs ever be seen as part and parcel of the game similar to training strategies and race strategies to improve performance? What would the sport look like if drugs were permitted? Why do we champion genetics over responsiveness to artificial enhancement?

Bradley's reaction after stage 8 seemed to express a lot of aggravation he has about being compared to teams associated with drugs. I would like to get everyones thought on this, as from twitter and my other cycling buddies, the doubts are slowing edging out the belief.

I like Wiggins a believe cyclist that have come through the British cycling academy are amongst the fairest and cleanest of cyclist out there (although David Millar is not a testament to this)

I would like to hear your thoughts

The painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio was named after the the start town but clearly the race didn’t find much inspiration because the route is hardly an exploration of light and dark with the short climb above Barbano Vicentino the only bright spot. But the race is on and remember days like this are essential for the points competition. The finish in Vicenza is the home town of Campagnolo.

The descent is fast and regular without many technical points although it includes the uphill section from Sollières to Aussois, an annoying rise on the way down to Modane: long enough to matter but not a proper climb compared to the terrain around.

Then down to the Maurienne valley where they will turn left onto the Col du Télégraphe. Often seen as the first part of the Col du Galibier, it’s a mountain pass in its own right and at 12km long with an average if 7.2%, it’s hard work. More so since some of the steepest slopes come at the start meaning it can be selective right from the start.

Instead of going to the top at 2642m, the stage will finish by the Pantani memorial at 2295m. On the profile of the Galibier below it’s before the 14km point. A short descent follows into the ski resort of Valloire from where the Galibier proper starts. It’s a long straight climb out of Valloire with some flatter sections in Les Verneys and then up the valley to Plan Lachat where after a slight respite, the road bends, crosses a bridge and then seems to tip up to the sky. It’s here that the legendary part of the climb begins. A series of hairpin bends at 8-9% and the finish looms at the Granges du Galibier, the barns of the Galibier where some rough stone buildings hunker under rusting roofs of corrugated steel - [by Inrng](http://inrng.com/2013/05/giro-stage-15-preview/).

1368775643.0	1ei7yg	[Race Thread] Giro d'Italia - Stage 13	PelotonMod	15	1	53	" 254km today, a distance equivalent to Paris-Roubaix or the Tour of Flanders. Talking of the classics, you know the first part of Milan-Sanremo where little happens for hours? Well that’s when the race crosses the flat pianura Padana, the plains of the river Po. And the race spends hours in the same place today although in a west to east direction rather than north to south. It’s only after 175km that the terrain starts to change.

The climb to Tre Cuni is the decisive point for the sprinters. It’s listed as 10km long and averages 4.8% but infact it’s a 15km drag from Alba and there’s a section for 5km at over 5%. Not much to drop the sprinters but a fast pace here could tire the legs of some enough to slow them in the sprint. The descent afterwards is fast and technical with molto curves and 10% gradient. This continues to the finish with several rises along twisting roads past the Barolo vineyards, not ideal terrain to set up a sprint finish - [by Inrng](http://inrng.com/2013/05/preview-giro-stage-13/).

1365927319.0	1cbfmz	[Race Thread] Amstel Gold Race 2013	PelotonMod	18	3	248	"Giant crowds, 34 climbs and a brewery as race sponsor, what’s not to like about the Amstel Gold Race?

This is a different race to the ones we’ve seen in recent weeks. Born in 1966 it is the newest of the spring classics and one defined by suburban roads rather than medieval farm tracks. It marks a change in the season where stage race specialists compete alongside one day specialists. But some things remain constant: Peter Sagan is riding and it’s hard to look beyond him - [By Inrng](http://inrng.com/2013/04/preview-amstel-gold-race/)

Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed guests, past Grand Tour winners and rabid fans, I'd like to take this moment to welcome you back to the Roubaix shower block for the presentation of the 2012 /r/Peloton Awards!

*Crowd goes wild*

Looking back on 2012, /r/Peloton has grown from a handful of cycling tragics into what is currently about 1800 cycling tragics in 12 short months. We've battled doping conspiracies, a dull Tour and more doping issues, but been pleasantly rewarded with epic Tours of Italy and Spain, awesome one day races and some of the most dominant displays of team and individual prowess.

*Video montage plays*

The effort of the submitters and commenter's from this subreddit deserve recognition and that's why we are all here tonight. We have five categories to award with the winner of each being presented with a signed Bradley Wiggins Yellow Jersey as well as an Arenberg cobble .... wait a minute....

*Frantically checks notes*

Sorry, there's been a slight mixup. The prizes will instead be something far more valuable and rare - a month of Reddit Gold! Thanks Reddit!

Our first award this evening is for:

**Best Video Post**

In the end, it was never going to be anything else but the slickly presented Orica-GreenEDGE video for ""Call me Maybe""! Not only was it a popular pick here, but it's also the second highest voted post of all time in this subreddit! The original thread was submitted by /u/WilhelmShakespeare and can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/peloton/comments/z970e/call_me_maybe_oricagreenedge/). Congratulations to our first award winner tonight - /u/WilhelmShakespeare!

Our second award of the evening is for:

**Best Picture Post**

A fiercely fought battle between two great pictures, with the Sagan modified bike complete with bell edging out Hipster Cav. The original thread was submitted by /u/Nerdlinger and can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/peloton/comments/w4m59/after_getting_caught_up_in_yesterdays_crash_sagan/). Congratulations to /u/Nerdlinger!

Next up we have:

**Funniest Post or Comment**

This award had us digging back through old posts to find those small pieces of comedic genius that pop up now and then. The competition was close again, but the comment that had you all in fits of laughter was ""Kazakhstan greatest cyclist in the world all other countries cycle like little girls."" /u/embarg0 was the author and is no doubt going to go on to a long career as a cycling comic. That's a thing, right? Congratulations /u/embarg0!

Now to the business end of the awards:

**Best Post**

With so many choices it's hard to narrow down the best, but /u/hystrix captured the imagination of the subreddit with their [Fun Facts &amp; Random Observations](http://www.reddit.com/r/peloton/comments/10lbc4/fun_facts_random_observations/). By analysing comments during the season, /u/hystrix was able to determine lots of interesting stats and funny facts about /r/Peloton and its readers. We all enjoyed it so much that this is now the Best Post of 2012. Congratulations /u/hystrix!

And finally, the award you've all been waiting for:

*Suspenseful drum roll*

**/r/Peloton User of the Year**

The award of awards! Our very own Golden Boot! The user who contributed highly across the season and helped everyone enjoy the sport more. And the winner is....

*Another suspenseful drum roll*

/u/Nerdlinger! Always well informed on the Lance saga and the ins and outs of doping and it's history, /u/Nerdlinger kept us all up to date on what was unfolding and what it meant for all partied involved.

Special mention goes to all nominees, but especially to /u/Andrichuk who came in second place and to our tied for third place getters: /u/istarbel, /u/Quibbleknott, /u/hystrix and self nominee, /u/Avila99! It should be mentioned that whilst we have recognised the efforts of a small few here, it's the entire community that makes this place great and we really couldn't have done it without all of you, so thanks to everyone!

That concludes the formal part of our evening. All guests and award winners are welcome to shower off the mud and grit from the ceremony and we will be engraving the winners names in the showers shortly.

If you are an award winner, you should receive your gold shortly. If anything goes wrong, please message me.

If you would like to view the votes, please visit the [original nomination thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/peloton/comments/15lhuk/rpeloton_2012_awards_please_come_and_vote/) where the should now be viewable.

Thanks again for everyone for nominating, voting and participating, it's been a great year. Thank you all and good night."	t5_2suzs	True

The cycling powers that be have been doing their best to pretend that doping isn't widespread, generally accepted and something with a long history in the sport. Anything which shakes that official denial is good.

I do feel bad, however, that cycling has been singled out by their efforts to clean it up. As far as I'm concerned, all professional sports (okay, maybe not curling) are rife with doping. My only worry is that cycling may come out with a black eye when, in fact, global professional sports culture is probably pretty much the same.

1371166440.0	1gaxi4	/r/Peloton Velogames 2013 Tour de France Competition	PelotonMod	17	1	31	"Hi all

With the Tour de France just around the corner, it's time for us to open up our Velogames Fantasy Competition league!

For those that haven't played Velogames before, it's a similar concept to fantasy football. You pick your riders and they score points based on a bunch of different metrics. You may make unlimited changes to your team until the entry deadline of 12:15 CEST (Central European Summer Time) on Saturday 29th June 2013. Once the race starts, there are no transfers, so you won't be able to change your team again throughout the race. Your picks must include the following:

* 2 All-Rounders
* 2 Climbers
* 1 Sprinter
* 3 Domestiques
* 1 Wild Card

The rules and scoring system can be found [here](http://www.velogames.com/tour-de-france/2013/rules.php)

You can sign up here: [Velogames Fantasy Giro](http://www.velogames.com/tour-de-france/2013/index.php)

The Reddit league is: [14001028](http://www.velogames.com/tour-de-france/2013/leaguescores.php?league=14001028)

Last years standings looked like [this](http://www.velogames.com/tdf/leaguescores.php?league=22022638). We had 107 entries at the Tour last year (and 66 at the Giro this year) - let's see if we can beat that.

Keep an eye out for a couple of posts about how to select the best team, who is good value and who you should stay clear of. They will start to appear in the coming days.

Thanks and good luck! "	t5_2suzs	True
1371051395.0	1g78ib	[Tour de France 2013 Team Discussion] Lotto - Belisol	PelotonMod	14	1	48	"It's still 17 days to go till the 2013 Tour de France starts and it's time to start previewing the race. We start with the teams! Basicly we'll be doing the same as with the [Giro d'Italia Team Discussions](http://www.reddit.com/r/peloton/comments/1d4xoa/giro_ditalia_2013_team_discussion_master_thread/):

---

We thought it would be fun to make a 'team guide' as a community where we introduce the teams for the Tour de France. The various well known web sites often give statistics or news but you'll rarely come across a web site that gives text info about the skills of each individual riders. So we thought why not make a guide ourselves?

---

**How does it work?** 

It's really quite simple. The mods will post one thread per team from now on until the start of the Tour. So that's 22 threads for 22 teams. In each thread we will post the selected teams along with their previous results. We will also make 9 comments in the comment section including the names of the 9 riders of the team. By replying to these comments we can gather information about *each rider individually*. So we have a little guide for every rider, which includes info like:

* What is his skillset? Strenghts? Weaknesses?
* What are his results in the past?
* What is his role in the team?
* Just basicly any info about the rider in question, stories, videos, pictures are all welcome too! 

Of course general information about the team in question is also welcome. Eventually we'll have a 22-thread guide for all teams in the Tour de France. We can also link back to these threads for extra info during the stages.

The start is novel with half a lap of the Velodrome in Mori before exiting into the town and starting the climb on the slopes of Monte Baldo in no time. The climb can be divided into three parts:

* First, as far as the Brento, the road is wide and regular, constantly climbing at about 6% on a new surface
* A short and gentle descent into Brento for the time check and then a false flat for about 3 km
* The final 7 km of constant climbing at 7-8% all the way to the line - [by Inrng](http://inrng.com/2013/05/giro-stage-18-preview/).

He obviously still had it (whatever 'it' was), as he showed when he came back.

I only really started watching cycling '07/'08, and following it properly in the last few years. I have obviously read plenty about his, and US Postal/Discovery's, doping scandal but this thought has never really crossed my mind before!

1357793076.0	16aosh	Official /r/Peloton Road.cc Fantasy League!	PelotonMod	17	3	36	"Hey guys!

Given the popularity of the road.cc league during the Grand Tours last year, we've decided to set one up for the entire 2013 season. 

New to Fantasy Cycling? That's ok, it's simple! Basically, you pick a team of nine riders to compete in various races over the year. Riders score points based on how well they perform throughout the stage or race. Between each stage or race, you can change your riders so you may pick the riders most suited to days racing.

Road.cc have a very detailed guide on how to play. If you're new to Fantasy Cycling, especially the road.cc league, take a couple of minutes and read through their 'how to play' guide posted below.

There will be a link on the sidebar year round with a link back to this thread and we'll have update posts every month or two so we can chat about how our teams are going. To join the /r/Peloton road.cc league, all you have to do is register to road.cc, go to your team page and click the ""Join a league"" button. After that, enter the league ID from below and get to picking your riders! 

**[How to play](http://fantasy.road.cc/howto)**

**[Road.cc registration](http://fantasy.road.cc/)**

**[/r/Pelotons league ID: 76232](http://fantasy.road.cc/leagues?ldtid=6&amp;lid=76232)**

Keep an eye out for the Velogames Fantasy League which we will still be running for the Spring Classics and the Grand Tours. 

We will also be running our own [Official Reddit Fantasy League](http://www.reddit.com/r/peloton/comments/16odmk/official_reddit_fantasy_league/) separate to Road.cc and Velogames we should be a bunch of fun. Information on that will be coming very shortly, so keep your eyes peeled!

&gt; We've got 2 leaders. Greg [van Avermaet] gets a somewhat free role. Greg knows when he has to help and catch up to guys from the ""second row"".
&gt;
&gt; Everyone can assist us really long. Vansummeren won't get too exhausted from staying with me, he should be able to do the last round as well. I expect a lot from Roelandts. I think everyone is capable of doing the last round.
&gt;
&gt; [Boonen's father gives him 95% chance of winning on Sunday]
&gt;
&gt; Ha, that's parents for you, but he knows I've been living towards it and really want it. I'll be happy if everything goes fairly, no bad punctures/falls/...
&gt; Not a lot of difference between first and fifth [as in: it can change over minor things], I'll be glad if I get a good chance of defending my chances.
&gt;
&gt; Madrid 2005 was different than now, I had some troubles running up to it and then had super compensation and was super on that particular day. I'm good with one day races. Thought podium would be great, just went for that sprint without knowing who was around.
&gt;
&gt; We've got a system to communicate amongst our teammates, but I'm not gonna explain that to you now. Maybe after the race. Not going deeper into it. Opponents also read newspapers.
&gt;
&gt; Freire is one of _the_ people to beat. Gerrans as well. They're my two top favourites. Rodriguez is great uphill, but I think not good enough for the last bit of the Cauberg.It's far after that and he's very light.
&gt; Valverde and Rodriguez _would_ be something to watch out for. Valverde has a quick sprint and with Rodriguez helping him that could be dangerous.
&gt;
&gt; Ye my palmares does feel a bit astronomical now, but I'm not ready with it yet. Wouldn't mind some more spring classics. Roubaix another time would be great.
&gt;
&gt; Lore [his gf] will be there on Sunday as well of course. I've also already lost when she was around. [The reporter hinted at him always winning if she comes to watch]

And just for kicks because it gives me goosebumps every time:

The HC-rated Port de Balès looms large, a climb that goes on and on. Then a sharp descent before the riders hit the Col de Peyresourde, climbing the descent they tackled the previous day before a short descent and then turning off to the ski station of Peyragudes with a ramp at 10% before the slope eases to the finish line. Altogether a decisive day in the mountains for the overall but also for the King of the Mountains prize and a cruel stage for riders who are struggling to stay in the race. Even if it is cloudy the riders who make the finish should be able to see Paris and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.(Coefficient 5)

1342337553.0	wl3or	[Race Thread] Tour de France 2012 - Stage 14	tdm911	17	4	221	"Don’t be fooled by the lack of altitude on this stage, the climbs make up for their modest height with steep gradients. This is a stage where riders aiming for a high position overall need to decide whether they sit tight and defend a position in the top-10 or whether they try to exploit the Mur de Péguère. Note this isn’t a mountain pass but a mur, a wall. It hasn’t been used in the Tour de France since 1973 but local races have tackled the slopes. It’s roughly 9km at 8% but the last three kilometres average 13% and the slope hits 18% before a descent into Foix, including a small finish loop around the town. I fear the climb is too far from the finish for fireworks but anyone on a bad day is going to be found out.(Coefficient 4)

1342161300.0	whkid	[Race Thread] Tour de France 2012 - Stage 12	lurkingx	15	3	166	"A long day as the race crosses the Alps but uses more river valleys instead of mountain passes to avoid climbing. A scenic route and if the riders don’t have time to appreciate the landscape, hopefully the TV helicopter can. It’s Friday 13 but for many in France this is a lucky day, people will buy lottery tickets. They call this a transition stage and two big climbs early on should help a breakaway get time on the bunch. But whether they’re lucky remains to be seen as there’s an uphill finish later which might tempt some of the sprinters’ teams to chase.

The length is significant but not huge, the organisers obviously don’t want to ruin the suspense ahead for the remaining two weeks. The course is technical and on relatively small roads, rolling up and down for most of the time. It’ll be scenic with the start outside the royal salt mines, once a valuable commodity. Appropriately enough for the stage the finish is in Besançon, the home of French watch and clock-making.

We've had a very exciting Spring Classics this year and this subreddit has grown very quickly since Paris-Roubaix. Thanks to everyone who has joined in!

We've had a few requests about spoilers in the titles of posts here. The moderation team has thought about this a lot and we have made a decision:

###No spoilers in post titles, instead, put [SPOILER] at the start of the title

That's it, there are no more rules. We suggest a title along the following lines:

*[SPOILER] La Flèche Wallonne 2012 Results and Discussion*

We hope this suits everyone.

We won't be changing how the subreddit sidebar works however. It will continue to have a picture of the winner of the latest race and also the winner will be written in the sidebar like it is now. If you don't want these spoilers, don't visti the subreddit until you know the result. I don't see this being an issue though, as it was only posts appearing on the front page that seemed to be an issue. Especially considering I always do them the morning after I watch the race (normally 8-10 hours after it finishes).

I hope this is easy to follow and make sense. If you have questions, please ask!"	t5_2suzs	True

&gt;The 2013 Tour de Pologne will be the first UCI WorldTour event to introduce a pilot project designed to highlight the excitement and attractiveness of each day of racing.The project introduces a **new system of bonus points for riders who win a series of contests organised during each day of racing**.

&gt;These may include **intermediate sprints, and mountain pass or hill contests**. At the end of each stage a general “Race Appeal” classification will be established by adding up the points awarded. **The top riders of this classification will obtain time bonuses on the event’s general classification**.

&gt;**The number of riders per team will be six as opposed to the usual eight**.

&gt;“This contest will add extra spice to each day of racing,” explained UCI President Pat McQuaid. “The riders will have added motivation at certain points throughout the day, and the spectators will be treated to some exciting and spectacular competitions.”

&gt;This new project was approved by the Professional Cycling Council in February this year. The project was put forward by a special working group made up of representatives from cycling’s main stakeholders, including teams.

&gt;“The Tour de Pologne has always been aware of new trends and open to innovation. This is why with great enthusiasm and interest we embrace all those solutions which, as in this case, can contribute to rendering the race even more spectacular and exciting, with the aim of attracting increasing numbers of people - not only experts but especially the general public, to the splendid world of cycling,"" explains the Director for the Tour de Pologne, Czeslaw Lang. 

&gt;After the 2013 Tour de Pologne (July 27th – August 3rd), it is envisaged to introduce the concept at other UCI WorldTour events in 2014.
