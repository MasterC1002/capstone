Totally awesome, highly recommended.  ""Burning the Altar"" is about 10x heavier in person than the studio version, holy shit.

Opening bands were Harrow and Alda, both black metal-ish.  Alda sounds similar in style to Agalloch if you're into that (personally I love Agalloch, so I was happy).  Harrow was also that style, but probably more on the black metal side of things.

Anyway, thanks to the people who organized it, tons of fun!

1352866684.0	135xm7	So Witch Mountain came to my house to personally deliver a t-shirt today.	donttreadonmike	42	2	13	"Just want to spread the word about how cool these guys are. My wife and I ordered a shirt from them a few months ago which for some reason never came. We exchanged a couple emails with them but just decided to cancel the order to save the hassle of trying to work it out. They noticed that we live near The Casbah which is one of the venues on their tour. They offered to give me the shirt for free at the show. I wasn't sure if I had to work the next day so we just said thanks but no thanks. Well a week or so went by and out of the blue they show up at my house. No warning at all. (actually they emailed us yesterday to ask if they could come over but we didn't check it, so it was a complete surprise.)

I was so shocked that I forgot to ask to take a picture with them. I also feel like I acted TOO cool and not grateful enough. I wasn't trying to be like that, my brain just wasn't accepting the weirdness of the situation, plus Uta is one of my favorite singers and I was just dumbfounded. 

Turns out I don't work tomorrow but I still can't make it out to the show tonight. goddammit. Ah well. Next time. Just wanted to spread the word that the people of Witch Mountain are legitimately cool people.

P.S. On the off chance that they read this before they head to Fullerton tomorrow, I have some great beer for you guys that I intended to bring to the Casbah haha"	t5_2riaf	True

I knew that it wasn't particularly common, but I didn't realise that it was such a collector's item, especially in the states. The thing is, because I got it as a free gift in a £5 magazine I felt like I shouldn't charge too much as that felt like extortion. 

Perhaps if I put it up for auction I could have got more than I did (which I won't disclose) but someone offered to take it off my hands and I thought he had a reasonable offer.

Most of my favourite albums this year are doom metal, so I clearly think it's been a great year for the candles, church organs and weed enthusiasts. And yet my choices are still rather restricted so I'd love to see what I've been missing.

So, tell us all about the doom albums that have blown you away or at least intrigued you this year! Please try and include descriptions, genres and links where you can.

---

Here are mine, with my few favourites towards the top. Links are in each title.

**[Jess and the Ancient Ones](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofI2heJhcOc) - s/t** [Occult Rock]
 
It's powerful, melodic and layered 70s prog/psych rock with mystical/magical themes and beautiful yearning female vocals. Full of hooks and not a dull moment. Not quite doom, but psychedelic/occult rock is obviously a close friend.

**[Witch Mountain](http://witchmountain.bandcamp.com/album/cauldron-of-the-wild)** **- Cauldron of the Wild** [Trad doom]

Second album by these guys (and gal) and I think it's way better than the first. Incredibly exciting, catchy and dynamic doom riffs with a real variety of songs and moods. Uta Plotkin's vocals are continually mindblowing. This band is really riding to the top of the modern doom scene doing a lot of great shows. They also released a free EP via Scion AV, go grab it.

**[Snailking](http://snailking.bandcamp.com)** **- Samsara** (debut EP/demo) [Stoner/Psychedelic Sludge - Free download]

These guys posted their _free_ demo to /r/metal and it got a huge reception - just because it's so goddamn fantastic. Named after the Ufomammot album, though their YOB influence seems much more obvious. It's three tracks and 40 minutes of non-stop heavy fucking riffs and progression that never loses your attention.

**[Altar of Oblivion](http://shadowkingdomrecords.bandcamp.com/album/grand-gesture-of-defiance)** **- Grand Gesture of Defiance** [Epic Doom]

These guys play fairly standard epic doom in the vein of Candlemass but a bit faster and punchier. It's incredibly grand and catchy and there's not a dull moment.

**[Woods of Ypres](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ieVfyEdZs)** **- Grey Skies and Electric Lights** [Gothic/Black]

These guys have nearly lost their black metal influence, becoming nearly totally clean-vocaled Gothic/doom. It's very well produced and full of atmospherics. David Gold's vocals are so deep, crushing and sorrowful, made all the more impactful by his tragic death before this album was released. It's on many people's top of 2012 list, for good reason, though there are a lot of haters around.

[**Second Grave**](http://secondgrave.bandcamp.com/) - **s/t** [Occult Rock/heavy/doom]

A debut EP in the Occult Rock trend that's very unheard of from what I've seen. Pity, because it's a great record. Earthy female vocals with dynamic, catchy songs that go from rock to heavy metal to straight up doom.

**[Adrift for Days](http://artascatharsis.bandcamp.com/album/come-midnight)** **- Come Midnight** [Psychedelic/ambient doom]

I heard these guys in a wicked awesome [free Australian Doom compilation](http://artascatharsis.bandcamp.com/album/drone-from-the-underside-of-the-earth), with their stunning track Back of the Beyond. It destroyed my soul and I knew I was hooked. It's very hard to categorise, with soft, psychedelic ambient parts that journey through the cosmos before coming to proper crushing doom. Great deep vocals too.

**[Pallbearer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efsUakRY2IQ#doom)** **- Sorrow and Extinction** [Trad doom]

Okay this is probably the most well-known album in doom for 2012 so I don't need to say much. It's very similar in song-style to Warning, but with atmospheric down-mixed vocals. There's not much pizazz and it's rather plain and isn't pushing any boundaries, but they don't need any of that because the melodies and atmosphere hold up so damn well.

**[The 11th Hour](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxcDFrdFh4M)** **- Lacrima Mortis** [Gothic/Doom]

Came out early on in the year and I always forget that it's a 2012er. Great catchy cleans and very solid growls interchange here to create a great gothic doom record. It's a supergroup.

**Other good mentions:**

Om - Advaitic Songs [Drone/ambient]. 

Pelican - Ataraxia/Taraxis [Usually called post-metal but I'd say this is very stonery]. 

Castle - Blacklands [Heavy/Doom/Occult rock, kinda thrashy]. 

Bedemon - Symphony of Shadows [Trad doom/rock - a pentagram offshoot]

Also, I haven't included all the sub-genres yet, just the main ones so far.  Anyway, this whole thing is up for discussion, and should you notice anything that needs changing, please say so.  Anyway, here we go:

&gt;

What we now call doom metal, began in the early 1970s with Black Sabbath.  At the time, the genre didn't exist, so bands playing this style back then, would get lumped into the hard rock, and later heavy metal category.

It wasn't until the early 1980s (with bands such as Saint Vitus, Trouble, and Candlemass) that doom metal was recognized as a distinct genre.  Later on, (mainly, in the early 1990s) these bands would be classified as traditional doom metal, while other sub-genres, such as death/doom, and funeral doom, became recognized as forms of doom metal.

So what is doom metal? Simply put, it is a sub-genre of heavy metal, which tends to have slower tempos, and a thicker, lower sound than most other metal genres.  The lyrics, and the music, usually evoke a sense of despair, helplessness, and overall, well, doom.

Now, let's dive into some of the sub-genres, and explore those.  Starting with...

**Traditional Doom**: This would be the 'core' genre of doom metal.  Typically, the tempo of the songs is faster (in relative terms, of course) than those of other genres, and the vocals tend to be clean.  It is, essentially, the most 'pure' form of doom metal.

*Some recommended bands*: Black Sabbath, Candlemass, Saint Vitus, Solstice, Reverend Bizarre, Trouble, Solitude Aeturnus, Pentagram


**Doom/death**: A fusion of doom metal and death metal, this genre rose to prominence with the 'big 3' (Anathema, Paradise Lost, and My Dying Bride) in the early 1990s.  In this sub genre, you'll find bands with a more death-metal like, crunchy guitar sound, and the typical low and slow doom metal pace.  Vocals are often grunted, but some bands use a clean vocal style as well.

*Some recommended bands*: Paradise Lost (early, and current), Anathema (early only), My Dying Bride, Evoken


**Funeral Doom**: This genre basically takes death/doom, and drags it even further and deeper.  It is one of the so-called 'extreme' sub genres of doom metal.  Starting with Thergothon and Skepticism in the early/mid 1990s, bands in this genre slow down the music to an excruciating pace, with minimalism often being a key factor.  The vocals are often gutteral and detached rumblings: an even further offshoot from their doom/death cousins.

*Some recommended bands*: Thergothon, Skepticism, Until Death Overtakes Me, Ahab, Funerary Dirge (note, this is my project), Shape Of Despair, Funeral


**Sludge Doom**: Picture death/doom, now make it dirty, filthy, and even slightly groovy, and you've got sludge.  The sound typically includes lots of feedback, and harsh, often screamed vocals.  You can almost liken it to southern rock gone terribly, terribly wrong (or right, in this case!).  It all started with bands such as EYEHATEGOD, Crowbar, and Grief in the early 1990s.  The former two being very representative of the southern 'sludgecore' style.

*Some recommended bands*: EYEHATEGOD, Grief, Crowbar, Negative Reaction, Goatsblood, Iron Monkey, Corrupted


**Stoner doom**: It's a groovier offshoot of traditional doom metal, and, as the sub genre name implies, usually fueled on pharmaceuticals (Weed is a common lyrical theme among many bands here).  Along with doom/death, it was one of the first true sub-genres of doom metal, starting around the late 1980s with Cathedral.

*Some recommended bands*: Electric Wizard, Cathedral, YOB, Sleep


**Drone doom**: If funeral doom is too fast for you, give this genre a try.  As the name implies, drone doom bands typically put up a huge wall of droning guitar sound.  Often, the music will include little to no vocals, and can be repetitive in nature.  It certainly qualifies as the most 'extreme' of all doom metal sub genres.

1323798612.0	nb7qu	Would you be interested in an [Origins Of Doom] chronology?	this_time_i_mean_it	16	2	8	"I've done this sort of thing before, and it's been well received.  If you're new here, and want to check them out, have a look at the [Doom Metal Chronology](http://www.reddit.com/r/doommetal/comments/i9n64/doom_metal_chronology_1970_2010/), and [Relatives Of Doom](http://www.reddit.com/r/doommetal/comments/kelw2/relatives_of_doom_final_semichronology_recap_and/).

Anyway, I've been considering doing another round of themed posts, and I think that the origins of doom, including pre-history (I'll go back as far as I can.  Some garage rock, heavy psych from the 60s, and perhaps even earlier, for example) would be neat to do.

This time, instead of focusing on one band per post, I'd want to try a multi-part article of sorts.  Each one would be a self post with an overview, some general commentary, and of course, lots of links to early heavy music that is either relevant to our genre today, or just something cool and obscure, that I think needs a second look.

Would you kind folks of Doomit be interested in this?

EDIT: That would be a yes, then.  I'll get started on it right away.  Right now, the plan is to post a pre-1965 article, then one article for each year up to 1969 or 1970.  I'll do one or two a week, starting next week.  I'll also try to make it in-depth, and hopefully interesting to read.

We went from 1970, and Randy Holden, to 2010, and Funeral Circle (start off somewhat unknown, and end the same way!).  I hope it's been a fun ride for everyone.  I know you guys enjoyed most of the stuff I posted.  I tried to go about 60/40 with obscure/known bands, and I made sure to post stuff I thought was enjoyable.  Nothing obscure for the sake of obscure, and nothing popular that wasn't dull and formulaic (yeah, you, the downvoter in the back with the trollface, I know I posted a My Dying Bride song... but hey, at least it wasn't off Evinta).

So, what's next?

A break from me doing theme posts.  I don't want to overdo it.  I considered doing an ""origins of doom"" week, and I have a lot of stuff lined up for it.  However, instead of making it a theme, I'll just post them a little bit at a time, so as not to clog this place up.

Also, we'll give you guys a list of all the Doom Metal Chronology posts, perhaps make a YouTube playlist, as was suggested.  I may not do the mp3 compilation thing, as I imagine that might be stepping on some sensitive copyright toes.  Though I doubt there are any doom bands that see it in such a light, some would equate this sort of exposure to a lost sale.  So, better safe than sorry.

Either way, we *will* post the chronology as one easily accessible post.  So, at the very worst, you can make your own compilation album out of 'em.

So, once more, I hope this was as fun a trip for you, as it was for me, and I want to thank you for joining me on this ride.

What songs would you play to introduce someone to doom metal? And why?

I'll start:

[Warning - Footprints](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=774GvRN2yKk)

[40 Watt Sun - Carry Me Home](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgJcsDbj-qI)

I have used these two songs previously to convince a friend of mine to give doom metal a second chance, and also to introduce my mum to the genre. I succeeded on both accounts. Why? Primarily because Patrick Walker (the vocalist on both tracks) has such a great voice that people (especially the older generation) can instantly appreciate. His voice has shades of Michael Stipe (R.E.M), Ozzy Osbourne, heck, even Cat Stevens. The music has that wonderful 'heavy and slow' doom quality and creates such a wonderful sense of despair. Love it. 

Since doom metal is so varied it's quite easy to find something that will appeal to the musical taste of others. For example, if you know that they listen to a lot of metalcore, you could show them something like [Swallow the Sun - The Justice of Suffering](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBzHNcITYdw) which has the screamed verses and clean choruses that you often find in metalcore. 

Anyway, share your thoughts. Spread the love. Doom is life, life is doom. 

UPDATE: Don't forget to include WHY the song you are posting could be a good song for introducing, or re-introducing someone to the glory of doom metal... otherwise it's just a general recommendation thread.

1319529242.0	lo6sc	Doom metal is an extremely varied genre.  Is doomit an equally varied audience?	this_time_i_mean_it	14	2	10	"I've noticed that the most well liked doom around here, tends to be traditional (or true) doom, and variations of stoner and sludge (and good on you, doomit! ...this is our core, after all).  However, most others, such as gothic, and funeral doom, are often ignored.

If I post My Dying Bride, Saturnus, Funeral, Nortt, Until Death Overtakes Me, or Funerary Dirge (my own stuff, btw... but its had a small impact on the scene, and deserves a spot here) it's usually met with little fanfare.

Personally, I think these bands are as much a part of our scene as Warning, Reverend Bizarre, and Electric Wizard, but I feel as if they're being swept aside by an audience who feels like this (true doom, and stoner) is all doom metal is.

Are we sweeping ourselves into a neat, confined space, and cutting off these odd branches just to trim the tree of doom back into its original shape? ...is it progression to another re-defining of doom metal, or stubborn regression back into the comfortable and familiar?

This got me thinking of doing another related series of posts, sort of like the Doom Chronology, but in this case, it would be songs by bands that aren't doom metal, but are either related to our genre (such as crust punk), or have written songs/albums that can called doom metal (such as some stuff by Master, and Necrosis' Acta Sanctorum album).

I'd also get into some 60s/early 70s heavy psych, some mid-80s grunge (Nirvana could make an appearance... yes, I'm serious), some early/mid 80s industrial (Swans would make the cut, for sure), and perhaps some eclectic noise/drone/ambient (Masonna, Merzbow, Trial Of The Bow... could find something doom related there, for sure), or even my own stuff if you don't mind (I have an unreleased Funerary Dirge album called Session 13, that I could pull a song off of, if you'd like).

So that's the idea... yes? ...no?

EDIT: That's a resounding yes, then! ...right on.  I'll do a decade each week, so it won't be strictly chronological, but still grouped together.  Posts'll be every Monday - Friday again.

------------------------------------

Some time ago, a couple months, I suppose, I found this sort of Black/Doom metal band on Bandcamp. I personally really enjoyed them, but their music cost money and I didn't have access to any online payment methods at the time. So I had to wait to get the music. I normally bookmark such music I want to purchase, but for some reason, I didn't. What I did do, for whatever odd reason, was record it to a cassette tape (probably because I picked a cassette deck up around the same time and was messing with it). 

Fast forward a few months and I have forgotten about the band. I found the tape and really wanted to find them again so I could finally give them money for that album and their other musical works.

Here's all I can remember about the album/band

- I think I found them on bandcamp discover, Already tried looking back through but it was too long ago for it to still be there. I couldn't find them through the tag system, either. It didn't go back far enough.
- They had a few albums out, mostly demos without song titles or they were just numbered. Most only had one or two songs included. I think the first few demos song titles were just roman numerals, two per songs demo, in numerical order. There was one or two ""Real"" albums with actual song titles, but I think still two per set.
- This album I recorded was released on cassette. The cover was some sort of demon, and something with a a medieval soldier. Vague, since that describes 50% or more of metal cover art, but it's all I can remember *(Thinking back again, the medieval soldier and Demon might have been on seperate albums)*.
- The songs are long. 10, 15 minutes or more.
- They were either from California, or they were going to be part of some sort of concert in that region.


Recordings are [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNOM2eO2EkI&amp;feature=youtu.be). It's two songs, both songs are around 15 minutes long, and pretty similar. This recording turned out well considering the cassette deck is a beat up low end model.


Thanks.

------------------------------------

It's probably a stretch that this can be found, but I'm hopeful. I'll get this posted somewhere where somebody recognizes it, If I'm lucky it'll be here. Probably not, though. Each post I've made so far has lead me a little closer, I think. If then rest of the reddit posts fail I'm going to post to the Metal Archives and Metal Storm. If those fail, hopefully they'll lead me somewhere else like the Reddit posts have.

Thanks for your time.

NEVERMIND_-

YES. I FOUND THEM, finally. [LINK](http://mizmor.bandcamp.com/album/untitled-winter-ep)

The way I found them was when I was originally searching for this band, I found one band that was ridiculously similar to them, Ash Borer. I looked at the list of supporters on their first release, a demo, and stalked those people's profiles. After about an hour or so of searching through those people's profiles, I found someone who had bought the exact album I was looking for.

Turns out I was completely wrong about the California thing. They're from Portland, but the description in the Cassette confirms a concert thing. Also, they didn't have as many albums out as I thought they had. Otherwise, though I think I gave a fair description based on my fuzzy memory.

Thanks for looking at my post, then. Hopefully you'll like this band and gain something from it since this is pretty useless now."	t5_2riaf	True

So, our little slice of Reddit has certainly grown a lot this year.  We are, believe it or not, one of the more popular metal related sub-Reddits.  We're actually the fourth biggest!

Now then, a couple of notes for the new year.

First, I've changed the user flair settings, so that you can edit your own.  Second, the Origins Of Doom series, I'm putting on hold for now, because at this time, I don't think I can give you guys a really worthy series.  I'll do it in the new year though, hopefully around February.  I want to give you a magazine worthy series of articles, and something that you'll truly enjoy reading, and find both entertaining and informative.

Anyway, I just want to say thanks to everyone for making this place so awesome.  Keep doing what you're doing, and here's to more great doom in 2012.

Doom on!

It'd be nice if you tell me how you like it, and if you don't want to tell me, then recommend me some fruity, heavy, dry red wine and some artists like Deinonychus on their Mournument album.

Thanks.
