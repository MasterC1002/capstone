I have been eating 3,000 kcal every day to bulk, and I've been assuming that since I'm still sore as fuck on my offdays, I'm still recovering, so extra calories = good still. The more I thought about it, the less sure I was, as I know the increased protein synthesis from lifting lasts for about 24 hours after exercise and then rapidly declines.  
  
So, eat the same every day? Or eat 3,000 on training days and maintenance (~2,500) on off days?  
  
Thanks, and sorry for the wasted space post. Google was useless.

For those of you who don't know, it basically turns everything in your stomach in to liquid and forces it out of your colon, whether you want it to or not. 

Well, you guessed it. I shit myself. I shit myself hard. It happened like a sneeze happens while you're taking a final exam in a dead quiet classroom. Everyone was busy, minding their own business, when they're forcibly introduced to your bodily function. 

I was doing squats at the rear of the gym. It happened right as I bent my legs. It didn't end until I was about a foot away from the door. I drove by the gym about an hour later to people standing outside. A friend of mine that goes there says they had people cleaning - not the normal gym employees; they hired a specialty team. 

TL;DR: I will now be relocating my workouts to a different gym after buying some new shorts, socks and shoes. 

**Edit**: I called the gym and will be paying for the clean up. I'm sure 24 hour fitness could have covered the bill, but I just felt so shitty about the whole situation. "	t5_2ql8s	True

EuropeCrisis	612	137	107	"So it's been a while since the new system where the mods could decide if the score of comments should be hidden, and for how long. In some subs, this is an excellent feature, no doubt. But not for /r/bodybuilding

Seeing the comment score makes it easier to trust comments. If a question is asked in a thread or posted as a text, seeing the score is rather useful to see how reliable the answer is. And seeing it quick, rather than have to wait for x hoursm for so to return, isn't annoying, as having to wait for a long time is. 

So mods, please, remove the feature of hidden score. Or atleast ask the subs of /r/bodybuilding if we want to keep it. The sub was much more enjoyable when we could see scores on questions, answers and just pictures in threads."	t5_2ql8s	True

First, by the title alone, you probably want to see the picture:
[Before and After (with 100lb difference)](http://imgur.com/ZtSWY)

Now the text: When I started this journey in bodybuilding in 2006, I started it because I grew up the skinny kid, the one made fun of because of how lanky he was. Tall and skinny, that was me. I admired bodybuilders, but could never imagine BEING one of them. I was just always going to be the skinny one, my genes would never let me pack on any size, right?

Well, I fought hard, and this is the result. When I began, my expectations were low, really, I didn't expect any major gains. I told myself if I could get 18"" arms by the time I was 30 (I'm 28 now), I'd be lucky, that would be MORE that I could expect. But, I found training that worked for me, plugged away at the diet, and grew, a LOT. None of it was easy. Many sore moments, a few tears, and a few more times throwing up led up to this.

I made most of my major gains in my first couple years... and then for a few more years I'd been cycling between 200lb and 240lb, always trying to get big enough to have gained 100lb from where I started, and failing, shrinking down again. I competed in my first bodybuilding competition in 2009, and placed 6th out of 11 competitors. 

This year however, I rediscovered a new intensity to my training, pushing myself further than ever before. And this week I achieved it, 255.3lb on the scale. The skinny kid is 100lb bigger than he used to be.

Right now I'm doing a bulk, so it's not lean mass. But still, I'm taking a moment to enjoy the century gain in poundage before I go for more, and then cut down. I'm going to compete again in 2013, and I hope it will be a good one!

So hey, skinny kids. Don't care that your genes suck - you can do it, I promise."	t5_2ql8s	True

Each time I see those posts I want to respond with a picture or story about my buddy, but never get around to it. I figure it's time to post some results and background. Here's what you can expect from hard work and dedication if you're not taking anything. Also, he's still getting (slowly) bigger and stronger. 


Here are a few photos taken November 2012. He's been working out for the last 8 years, bench is over 400lbs, squat over 400lbs, and deadlift 600lbs. He lifts for strength/power half the week, body building split the other half. Oh, he's also the ""unofficial"" world record holder in the weighted pullup. 

We've been friends since kindergarten and I'm very proud of his accomplishments. I just wanted to share his results.

Background: I'm a USAPL powerlifter with a 250 squat, 165 bench and 305 deadlift. After years of loving the look of the figure division and getting sort of bored with training purely for strength,  I decided to pick a competition and prepare for it. 

I'm a grad student, so paying for a coach was out of the budget. Thankfully, my area of research is related to human nutrition and physical activity, so I know the drill. 

So far, progress has been steady &amp; on target. Here I am when I just started my prep vs. now, 10 weeks out (I'm 5'5""):

http://i.imgur.com/dgKAjx6.jpg

The most important part of my journey so far has been doing this in a healthy, responsible and sustainable way, which I write a lot about on my [blog](http://www.swolesister.com). I eat plenty of food, plenty of carbs, and do maximum 2 sessions of HIIT cardio per week. The coolest part is that I haven't lost any of my strength yet, and have actually gotten stronger. Here I am deadlifting 300 lbs for a double just  this past training cycle:

[300x2](http://youtu.be/bLWUeIKxBOI)

I'm sharing my story partly out of vanity and personal accountability, but also because the current trends in women's physique competition prep scare me. I have worked with women with clinical eating disorders in the past, and I see a lot of familiar issues in the women's fitness industry today. I hope that I can be an example for women that you can develop a fit physique without hiring an expensive coach, starving yourself, or becoming a slave to cardio.

If you want to keep updated, I post a lot of recipes, videos and stuff on my [blog](http://www.swolesister.com). I also post more frequently on my [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/renee.dean.5623)

I want to do something positive and you are the people that have succeeded in this, so if you've experienced anything similar and have advice or gonna tell me to man up, I'd rather it come from this community.

3 years ago I was anorexic and 56lbs age 13. I'm now turning 17 and weigh 170 ~9%bf and what started with a couple compliments has lead to almost everyone I used to be friends with reject me.

I'm quite reserved as a person and I definitely don't show off or boast, however they stopped inviting me out, They prank phonecall saying horrible shit, take the piss for having tubbawear meals and going gym. They say ""you're wasting your time because you're still a skinny cunt"" ""you're not even big/strong"" when they found out I compete in juniors powerlifting also. I can't escape the shit, at school, at home, online, constantly,
and this shit is just getting to me. I thought they'd be proud of me for actually making something of myself but i'm totally isolated for the lifestyle choice I made and I'm not sure what's the answer.violence, or just deal with it.

http://www.reddit.com/r/bodybuilding/wiki/index  
  
I am no expert, if something is off or wrong, please say so and I'll change it. Or delete this. It really is just a rehash of the FAQ for a lot of threads that have been popping up as of late.  
  
**Supplements**  
""Should I take product 'X' and what does it do?""  
  
Supplements aren't that tricky, I mean it's in the name. Supplements, well, supplement. Go figure. Need more of something? Supplement it! Pretty simple and ten to one odds you don't need whatever it is you're looking at. Here we'll look at common questions.  
-Protein powder  
Used if you are unable to get your goal amount, in grams, of protein or you want a quick and convenient want to ingest more. Timing, for the mere mortals, is not going to matter all that much. Just get enough.  
-Pre-workout X  
Most are just caffeine and then some fancy words. A cup of coffee or downing a typical caffeine pill (200mg) is just as good and cheaper. Use if you find yourself fatigued before you go to the gym (long day at work kind of thing).  
-BCAA, glutamine, *ine  
You don't need this. If you do, you'll know it. Save your money for food.^3  
-Creatine  
Probably the only thing worth it's weight. Take it in powder form because it is more effective and cheaper. A uick rundown bt /u/apathy20  
Look up Adenosine Triphosphate cycle or ""ATP"", which in turn releases a phosphate and turned in to ""A. DIphosphate"" Creatine phosphate then donates it's phosphate to become ""ATP"". By increasing your stores of creatine, this particular source of energy cycle is extended in length.
  
**Bulk/cut/BF%/etc**  
""I'm 'X', should I bulk or cut?""  
Read below for about food. Really, if you have no muscle, or are 'skinnyfat' as people like to dub themselves then the answer is just eat ""right"" and go lift. Cutting will leave you with nothing and a typical bulk will make you think you're fat.  
  
""I want to get to X% body fat.""  
This means almost nothing. You might think it does. You read somewhere that abs start to show at 10% right? This is about looks, not numbers. The only numbers that are relevant are below in food and size of muscles. This is what you should ask yourself. If cutting: ""Do I look cut enough yet?"". If bulking: ""Am I too fat now."". Oversimplification, but not really.  
  
**Food**  
""How much should I eat? What should I eat?""  
  
I find a lot of people overestimate what their activity level is so we're using the most basic of formulas.  
-Lose = BW * 12-13  
-Stay = BW * 15-16  
-Gain = BW * 18-19  
  
Where Calories come from.  
-1g carbs = 4 calories  
-1g protein = 4 calories  
-1g fat = 9 calories  
  
If you are in your teen years or for all beginners, that's all you really need + 1g protein per lb body weight. Don't stress over lean bw vs total bw, it won't matter all that much in the beginning. If you want to get in to macros a basic thing for gaining to do is as follows:  
-Protein = 1g per 1lb BW  
-Carbs = 2x Protein  
-Fat = The rest (Daily limit - (P*4) - (C*4))/9  
  
Just start with that and adjust as needed.  
  
**Lifting**  
""How does this split look?""  
First off, why are you making your own split? Are you just starting? Then do a beginners split. Really this is the least complicated part of a very uncomplicated^1 (in theory) sport. If you've never lifted before I would not suggest a BB split and would jump on the overused train of SS. Why? You don't know how to lift and have no fundamentals. Going from no muscle to anything above that comes down to eating enough and lifting enough. Do that for 6-12 months and then reconsider. Yes, 1/2 to 1 year, this isn't an overnight thing.  
  
""So what should I be doing?""  
Lifting I guess. If you're asking how to lift, we can do that. Everyone mentions this mind/body connection and contracting muscles, but you might not get that so we'll use an example. Stand up, hold your arm slightly bent at your side like you're about to DB curl. Flex. Now while flexing bring your arm from the starting position to the ending position and squeeze at the top. Done. That's it. I mean, more or less that is it, you might want to add weight or whatever. Don't stress about how much weight that is, it really isn't important. What is important is that whey you are done, you feel done. That in our curl exercise we just did looking at 15lb weights is just too much (of course don't go to complete failure).  
    
**Hey /r/bodybuilding, need help with X**^2  
Always ask questions, learning is good. However, when asking say as much as you can and FFS don't lie. Don't hide things. This is the internet and really we don't care, just want to help. Saying things like, ""I eat about X amount of calories"" means nothing. About? How sure are you? +-500 is actually a large (very large) margin. Say your age, height, weight, goals. Post pictures if relevant. Saying you want to lose weight without posting that information means that it will be the first thing you are asked.  
  
**Not in this guide**  
Just because it isn't in here doesn't mean it doesn't exist. This is basic, this is for starting out, and this should get you started and to an 'acceptable' level.  
  
^1 For starting at least  
^2 Putting in here because of a lot of recent threads  
^3 From comments:  
Most protein powders will already have enough BCAAs in them. As for the other things people try to sell, if you're beginning all you need to worry about is eating enough and lifting right. Glutamine is just an amino acid and not one of the major ones. It's marked as helping protein absorption and helping with recovery. It can be found in milk, milk like foods (cheese, yogurt, etc), chicken, pork, beef, fish, etc. Sleep for recovery.
Why pay extra money when you can just make a protein shake with BCAAs after working out and eat some chicken later and sleep? My rule of thumb is things are marketed at people who want to ""get X in Y weeks"". KISS philosophy here."	t5_2ql8s	True

I don't know weather its troll's or the so called ""summer reddit"" effect but people are just being straight up dicks. 

Most recently a guy was asking about how you would go about acquiring steroids/how and who to ask. I said a clear juicer or go to your doctor (which you should even if your getting them from black/grey markets) and got called retarded and down voted for suggesting a doctor. 

Retarded, really? Telling the guy who monitors your health? 

Look bad ideas have to be called out and explained why they're bad. Good ideas warrant discussion and possible tweaks, and everything else can be debated, discussed.

I don't care if people say i'm wrong, or an idiot, or doing something wrong, I just want an explanation of why i'm any of those things and what you think would be better.

Can we have some sort of sub-reddit rule where replies like

""Your split it shit and you should feel bad"" (no actually advice)

""Lol cardio, just diet"" (not saying you need to do cardio, although I think everyone should, this gives ify advice with no explaination why)

""Not natty, your juicing for sure"" (bigger guy shows progress pics, says he is a natty and half the thread is calling him a liar, if he says he is natty and he's not sponsored/average guy really into working out why would he lie about being natty or not)

Are banned, they add nothing but bad information and drama. Everyone just wants to look better, why can't we all get along?

The guy gets over the top excited and starts yelling, as if to hype me up and insists we do it ""italian style"", at this point im instantly regretting my decision. He then insists that im going to do 6 reps, i said no, maybe 2.. He disregarded my input. I laid down on the bench and he STRADDLES me from the front. Package just in my face. Im laughing at this point, but i have to go on. He picks the bar up and i do 6 VERY assisted reps while he curls 50% of the weight. Then proceeds to fist bump me and say "" IT WAS ALL YOU BRO, NICE LIFT"".

I have been meaning to post this for a while so results photos are a few months old but still accurate. I started my fitness journey in the summer of 2006 right after an extremely unhealthy freshman year in which I gained the freshman 15 each semester. This was mainly due to taking the all you can eat buffet at my dorm cafeteria as a challenge every night and my discovering of alcohol late into my second semester.  


**2006**  

Early Fall ~215lb http://imgur.com/EgMavlt Late Fall ~210lb http://imgur.com/54oVqkl  
My wake up call came when I came back home that summer and weighed in at 238 lbs which for my 6'1"" height makes a BMI of 31 which is considered obese. Also when getting my blood pressure checked it was 130/90 which is pre-hypertensive. These two revelations along with loving teasing from family and friends gave me the motivation to start an intensive workout plan. The routine I did for the next ~2 months was pretty simple as I did not know much about exercise at that point. I would run to the gym (1 mile away) and do 3 sets on 10 machines doing 5 minutes on the recumbent bike in between each machine then I would run back home. This got me down into the 215-220 lb range by the time I went back for my sophomore year of college. Being home had helped my nutrition as well as having noone to drink with in town but I was concerned about what would happen eating at the cafeteria again so I combated this by only eating breakfast there which consisted of scrambled eggs, sausage, biscuits, and skim milk. For lunch I just had sandwiches with potato chips and for dinner used my meal plan to either go to the campus chick-fil-a or the campus burger place. Definitely not the healthiest food options but made it easier to have a consistent amount of calories per day (though I had no idea of how to count calories at the time). That fall semester I started researching more about exercise and started taking a lot of supplements including a workout multivitamin (contained way more than I needed), a BSN stack of Cellmass, Nitrix, and NO-Xplode, as well as ON's whey protein (paid for by donating plasma 2x a week). I got down to 206 lb during that semester and that is the lowest I would weigh for almost 4 years though I was slowly increasing muscle mass and decreasing fat.  


**2007**  

Stayed in the 210-220 range not much changed. Dealt with some personal issues towards the end of the year and stopped going to classes.

Spring ~220 lb http://imgur.com/HOsPYhj  
 
In the spring I changed my major to Kinesiology, took an intro Nutrition class and eventually added Nutrition as my second major in the fall. Learned so much about the body, exercise, and nutrition was able to start making a lot more healthy choices though still partied 1-3 nights a week so didn't see too much of an improvement in weight though continued to get stronger. Stayed closer to 220 in this time.

Did the P90 program over the summer (predecessor to P90X). Stayed in the 210 range.  
  

**2010**  

2 year relationship ended mid spring and drank/partied a little too much the rest of the semester but got back into things during the summer.  Did insanity for the first time and helped shave off about 5 lbs. Highest weight: 195, Lowest weight 190.   


**2011**

Gave up alcohol for 9 months, then started allowing myself to imbibe once a month or on special occasions. Got a job personal training after graduating Dec 2010 so had access to a fully stocked gym whenever I wanted and the time to do intense 1hr+ strength training sessions. Did P90X workouts at the gym in the fall, substituting insanity workouts on the cardio days. Highest weight: 193, Lowest weight 188.  


**2012**

Did the first month of P90X2 but then switched to the M.A.S.S. program from MuscleMag during the spring. Summer moved to a new town to get ready for grad school in the fall. Started running 3 miles 5x a week, biking ~10-15 miles 3-4x a week and swimming 15-45 min 1-2x a week mostly due to not knowing anybody in town and having nothing else to do. Saw an advertisement for a sprint triathlon and decided to do that at the end of July. Absolutely loved the intensity of it and decided to start working up to a half ironman by the fall 2013. So slowly increased my mileage by 0.25 mi/week on the run and 1 mi/week on the bike the rest of the year. But also eating at a caloric deficit most days. During the fall I was either breaking even Mon, Wed, Fri or a few hundred calories under but Tues, Thurs, Sat I would be 1000-1500 calories under maintenance. I was eating 2500-3000 calories/day but towards the end I was doing 3 5-6 mile runs a week, swimming 1 mile a week, doing strength training 3x/week, and biking 30-40 miles 2-3x a week in addition to the 3 mile rides to and from campus. Did a few months of the Stronglifts program in the fall, then switched to a 2 workout/week, 1 ""push"" workout and 1 ""pull"" workout program towards the end of the year due to my increased load from triathlon training. Nutrition pretty similar to what I'll describe as my current diet in 2013. Highest weight: 193, Lowest weight 183.

Suffered a partial Achilles tendon rupture at the end of Jan that would set me back all spring. Yes this was probably due to overtraining and undernourishment in the previous semester but I had been eating at maintenance all of January (average 4000 calories/day) so I dunno. The injury was 2 days after my first 60 mile bike ride attempt on my first 7.5 mile run so that was probably more the cause than anything. During the spring did a modified version of Beachbody's Body Beast program at the gym, loved the workouts but videos were kind of obnoxious. Highest weight: 185, Lowest weight 178, 7% body fat.
  
  
Nutrition:  
Goal is to have low sodium ~2000 mg, ~40g fiber, macro split ranges from 50/25/25 to 50/30/20 CHO/Pro/Fat. Calories usually around 2500 but I adjust it daily. Protein around 150-170g. I usually input what I plan to eat the next day into MyFitnessPal to make sure the totals are what I want and can adjust accordingly.  
  
  
Fiber was actually getting too high especially on high calorie days so I've substituted the 100% whole wheat pasta I had almost every day with brown rice or enriched pasta and Honey wheat bread instead of 100% whole wheat on sandwiches.  
  
  
Low Calorie Breakfast:  

* Scrambled eggs with fat free cheese (1 whole, 3 egg whites)  

* Oats w/blueberries and ground flax seed  

* glass of Skim Milk  
  
  
High Calorie Breakfast:  

* Scrambled eggs with fat free cheese (1-2 whole, 3 egg whites)  

* Homemade pancakes with blueberries and dark chocolate chips ~425 calories  

* Honey  

* glass of Skim milk  
  
  
Snacks throughout the day:  

* Banana  

* Almonds  

* Yogurt (mixed with oats if didn't have for breakfast)  

* Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly sandwich (if need extra calories)  

* Whey protein post workout w/creatine  
  
  
Lunch:  

* V8 Low Sodium  

* 1 apple  

* Fish oil capsules  

* Sweet potato/potato mix that I bake in olive oil  

* Some fat free cheese sprinkled on if i need more calories/sodium that day  

* Extra lean beef or nearly fat free turkey breast cutlets  
  
  
Low cal Lunch/rest day:  

* V8 Low Sodium  

* 1 apple  

* Fish oil capsules  

* Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly sandwich or microwave pizza
  
  
Dinner 1:

* Chicken Breast tenderloin (grilled)  

* Brown Rice  

* Green Peas  
  
  
Dinner 2:  

* Pasta  

* Prego  

* Extra lean beef  

* Corn  
  
  
Dinner 3:  

* Tuna (low sodium)  

* Brown Rice  

* Broccoli  
  
  
The main point I wanted to make is to not put so much pressure on yourself to make huge drastic changes in a short period of time. Not everyone can lose 50-100+ lbs in a year nor should you. Just making small healthy changes to your diet and lifestyle will help you slowly lose the weight and when you get to your goal you will find it a lot easier to stay there because you will be accustomed to that level of intake/exercise. If there is anything else you would like to know just ask! 
  
*edit:* Fitocracy profile, feel free to follow me! http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/KingBeer/  

*edit2:* A lot of people have commented/asked about the differences between 2006-2011 and 2011 onward. The main difference besides have a lot more time and less social life is my goal setting skills. If you take one thing away from this post its that one of the best keys to success like I have had is actually setting small realistic measureable goals. So for example I want to lose/gain/lift this much by this time and to get there I want to have done this much by this time and so forth. Not as I was pre-2011 ""I just want to lose weight or be in better shape"", know what you want and find out how to do it. And also that while you should have your mind on the long term, focus mainly on the short term and take it one step at a time. Every pound towards your goal is a battle won in the long war that is your fitness journey. 
  
*edit 3:* Something that I feel really helped me maintain muscle mass while losing weight is my pre and post workout nutrition. For example I would have a meal, then 2 hours later 2 cups of fat free chocolate milk (good because has quick digesting carbs aka sugar and well as protein) then an hour later workout. Immediately after workout have post workout shake with whey protein and quick digesting carbs (I used Smarties candy instead of spending $20+ on post workout carbs that are essentially sugar) or more recently a protein shake that already has the carbs in it. Then an hour after my post workout shake have 2nd or 3rd meal of the day depending on timing. 

*edit 4:* A lot of people have expressed appreciation for the nutrition info I included, here is a diet plan I made for my friend based on his dietary preferences. He is 6', 27 years old and was wanting to bulk up about 0.5 lb/week.

Not crowded gym, but a sizable dude was near me doing some cleans.  He looked at me, looked down, then looked back up and nodded in approval with a grin on his face.  Probably one of the most motivating moments i've had in a while!

I have a passion for nutrition and exercise, and increasingly I see people asking for easy way out answers to their muscle building questions. It's taken me 2 years to finally figure out macronutrients numbers that I felt strongest, and looked best at. It's taken 2 years to finally be able to fully isolate and contract muscles. Even after 2 years of learning about my own body, in still clueless. But I'm always searching for something that works better. 

For those who want to build muscle and get close to your ideal body, I would beg you to not ask general questions. No rep range or exercise or macro percentage or program will work the same for everyone. It's all about experimentation. Just be patient and figure out what works best for you, not after two weeks, or even two months. It's a constant process of tweaking your approach and reflecting on how you feel. Overall, just work your hardest; don't leave the gym if you have more in the tank. Just because your day's workouts are over, doesn't mean you're required to leave. KEEP WORKING and be patient. If it was easy to build muscle everyone would do it. "	t5_2ql8s	True

However the crossfit trend is starting to really chap my ass. I work out on base, and crossfit is growing fast, what bothers me is that those who choose to par take feel the need to work out in a team, not with a partner, I mean like four or five guys. I used to think the squat rack curler was the most hated man in the gym, but these guys have taken the cake. They will spend almost all night crowded around the rack, between swing pull ups, half dead lifts, and awfully formed squats. When I workout I have my set plan and these guys getting in the way and forcing me to wait on or skip a exercise really thows me off my game. Sorry to rant on this wealth of knowledge and motivation with my beta whining I just thought some of you could relate... I've approached them before to jump in between sets and was told they were in the middle of a high intensity program and couldn't stop to let me work in. I think it is best I rant to you folks then hit one of them with a dumbbell.

TLDR; Crossfit fucks ruining my workout, spending all night in the squat rack...

The before pic was taken near the end of 2008 and I weighed about 170 lbs / 77 kg in the before pic and now weigh 207 lbs / 94 kg after.

Before http://i.imgur.com/PwAiMjz.jpg

After http://i.imgur.com/qQuGQLr.jpg

I'm hoping to add a lot more mass in general myself, but I'm looking for critique on what to improve! 

I ask because I recently got asked for a photo shoot (to my surprise!) and would love to present a better physique in the future! I'd love to hear any tips or things I should keep in mind in preparation for such a shoot too!

**To answer the questions concerning diet and routine:**  

I don't really follow a strict diet! :) I do consistently try to get in the protein portion of my macros though! Cottage cheese, milk, tuna, eggs, chicken and oatmeal and such throughout the day. I've been taking protein shakes starting this year, but I don't use any other supplements at the moment.

**Chest**  
4 set(s) of Incline Bench Press 15, 12, 9, 9 reps  
4 set(s) of Weighted Dips 8 reps and body weight reps until failure  
3 set(s) of Skull Crushers 9 reps  
4 set(s) of Incline Flies 12 reps  
1 set(s) of Push-ups until failure  

**Back**  
3 set(s) of Romanian Deadlifts 8-12 reps  
3 set(s) of Bent Over Rows 8-12 reps  
1 set(s) of Weighted Pull-ups 9 reps 
3 set(s) of Dumbell Rows 9 reps  
3 set(s) of Barbell Curls 15, 12, 9 reps as weight increases  
4 set(s) of Hammer Curls 12 reps  

**Shoulders/Triceps**  
4 set(s) of Seated Barbell Press 15, 12, 9, 6 reps  
3 set(s) of Dumbell Lateral Raises 3 reps  
3 set(s) of Lying Rear Delt Raises  
3 set(s) of Close-grip Bench Press 9 reps  
3 set(s) of Skull Crushers  

**Legs**  
5 set(s) of Back Squats 20, 15, 12, 8, 6 reps  
5 set(s) of Front Squats 8 reps   
5 set(s) of Lunges 8 reps  
4 set(s) of Calf Raises 15 reps  

I switch it up a lot due to not being able to train each day. Sometimes I train legs twice and sometimes I throw in different exercises on a certain day. I just enjoy doing most of those exercises and stick to most of them. I switch barbell movements up a lot with dumbbells though. 

Thank you all so much. I love to answer any questions :)

[This](http://i.imgur.com/l1P0R.jpg?2) was me a few weeks out last time. After some serious bloating and holiday eating, [this](http://i.imgur.com/GcLtN.jpg) is me now, [legs](http://i.imgur.com/mM7Ok.jpg) are getting bigger too. 

Pretty happy so far. Next show is in May. I'm hoping to do well even with such a short bulk period, but I have a feeling this time next year will be even better. I'm just happy to be training hard again and making gains, not just trying to be skinny and lean. Thanks to everyone else for their submissions that have been helping me along the way.

A few months ago [I posted this transformation pic](http://i.imgur.com/dveth.png), which had a very cool reception from you and made me feel pretty good. After that I got a lot of PMs and questions about my diet and workout regime and shit. I decided to launch a bodybuilding blog dedicated specifically to help skinny guys get bigger with very honest advice from personal experience. Something like a ""What I've learned."" This is an idea I had been toying with for a while.

I just finished uploading the first posts -- enough to ""launch"" it, so I wanted to do it here first. Hopefully you like it and don't see it just as spam. I genuinely think I have some stuff to say that some of you might find interesting.

But to launch it here on Reddit, I wanted to share my very honest thoughts on Crossfit, a discipline I'm no stranger to. I tried to hold back all the common circle jerking and just be very honest, but it's still mostly critical.

[Here's the link](http://wolfinagorillasuitingymclothes.blogspot.mx/2013/05/a-bodybuilders-honest-thoughts-on.html). I really hope you enjoy it. Peace!"	t5_2ql8s	True

Basically I judge everyone on their appearance more so than ever since I started bodybuilding. Not necessarily their personality. But their lifestyle / lifestyle choices that affect appearence. I find myself constantly comparing myself to others, could be the public in town casually checking out the dudes checking their bi's delt's chest calves etc. I will look at everyone and try to guess whether they lift or whether they look like they have never lifted a thing in their life. 

OR it could be people in the gym. 

At the gym every person that walks in I compare myself to. I judge whether they have better or worse apects of the body than me. I.E Someone walks in with the huge arms but I check their legs and they are matchsticks. Or I watch people working out and judge them for what/how they do something.

Now don't get me wrong I don't think I am better than these people or anything like that. I just constantly have a running commentary of whats going on around me and what they look like what they could improve on, what they have thats better than me, watching what they do, picking up ideas and tips or just visioning how I might compare on stage to them. reguardless of whether they train to compete or not.

[Another--You can just see the joy on my face. I was SO happy.](http://i.imgur.com/MitjOzR.jpg)

[Here is the rest of the album](http://imgur.com/a/Pb0dP)

So I got first call-outs and eventually placed 6th out of 12 girls all 5' 7.5"" and above. I was pleased for my first show. The winners had much more experience and muscle than I did, but the fact that I got called out to join them for first comparisons was such an accomplishment for me. I learned SO much, and now I'm squatting twice a week (later on I will be incorporating light legs a THIRD time each week) to prepare for my next show--February 15, 2014 in San Diego.

I need to take this time to build loads more muscle. On stage I was 128 lbs. I'd ideally like to be 135lbs with more lean muscle in about 30 weeks from now. BUT FIRST: I compete in powerlifting with San Jose State in October. We are currently working on strength, NOT bodybuilding. I cannot believe that just 9 months ago I was 172lbs and knew NOTHING about bodybuilding or powerlifting. Any questions? I'm willing to answer them now. Thank you all for the support.

I skimmed over responses for the 'favorite bodybuilder' question, Arnold was definitely #1, followed by Frank Zane and Kai Greene, then Zyzz and then the other popular ones: Ronnie, Phil, Sergio, Jay, Dorian, Franco. 

I will still be making v2.0 which will have more questions, so if you missed this one you still have a chance to fill that one out. It will also be open for longer than 24 hours.

Disclaimer:  Please excuse my dear terrible posing and faces.

**Routine:**  

In the past year my buddy and I did [Jim Stoppani's 12 weeks to strength and size](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/shortcut-to-size.html) workout twice non-consecutively.  That program kicked my butt but I saw my max bench jump from 225-240 the first time, and it's sitting around 260 now.  I *highly* recommend this program.  In-between, we did the workout that Chris Hemsworth did for Thor.  

Right now I'm lifting opposing body groups, twice a week, 6 days a week.  This is in an attempt to cut and maintain at the same time.  So far so good.

**Diet:** 

Nothing serious, I eat healthy.  Lots of egg whites, chicken, fish, pasta, and veggies.  I don't count calories or macros, but I am conscientious.  I've cut down a bit on carbs though since I'm trying to cut.  Also, lots of sushi.

**Numbers:**

Current weight is slightly under 160 lbs / 72.5 Kilos.  Height is 5'6"".  I don't really know any of my maxes right now."	t5_2ql8s	True

StavTheSwole	134	29	68	"Alright, I got a few pics but I'll keep it as brief as possible for you all. I have always admired muscular people. Being a Greek kid I always loved our history and the jacked as fucked sculptures and heroes of old... I was a skinny fuck [though.](http://imgur.com/a/IL84h#0) That's me at 15 playing my new bouzouki on Christmas. I told you I was skinny... and Greek.

I was super into music, anime and MMA in high school. I may have been a skinny emo looking shit, but I was trained well and in decent shape considering my size. Here's [me](http://imgur.com/a/IL84h#1) at 16. So brooding and dark. 

Senior year I had a buddy who trained at LA Fitness and told me to go with him. I instantly fell in love with weight training and seemed to have a natural talent for strength. I made gainz pretty quick and that was cool too. Here I am at [17?](http://imgur.com/a/IL84h#2) almost [18?](http://imgur.com/a/IL84h#3)

LA Fitness got lame so I joined a more hardcore gym and that's when shit took off. I started training there and people like [this](http://imgur.com/a/IL84h#4) were [regulars.](http://imgur.com/a/IL84h#5) Needless to say, those dudes inspired the living hell out of me. I got to train with Dennis James on several occasions and he taught me a lot. Fucking awesome dude. I was 19 at the time and I wanted to look like them so bad.

So I kept lifting hard and actually started to power lift. I was naturally strong as fuck and wanted to see what would happen unnaturally. So I did a test prop and anadrol cycle and ended up looking like this at age [20.](http://imgur.com/a/IL84h#6) and [another.](http://imgur.com/a/IL84h#7) I was bloated, but goddamn I felt swole and got strong as hell. I now regret doing that cycle, but it was an experience to learn from.

Like two months after those pics were taken I tore my rotator cuff DB shoulder pressing the 110's (no brag.) I couldn't train for a long time and lost lots of mass. Then once I started training again I got some extreme nerve damage in my back from another non lifting related accident and that set me back even further. I couldn't train, I got depressed, my GF hated me lifting and I was smoking weed all the time and eating out. I didn't lift for almost TWO FUCKING YEARS. This is what I turned [into.](http://imgur.com/a/IL84h#8)

Not too bad with a shirt on right? WRONG. FUCKING [WRONG.](http://imgur.com/a/IL84h#9) I turned into a goddamn [sea cow.](http://imgur.com/a/IL84h#10) Those pictures were taken last July right around my 23'd birthday. Like a lot of other people my New Year's Resolution was to fucking change this shit. I was so sick of looking at my fat ass in the mirror. I was lifting again in July, but it was time to take it seriously. In December (I started Resolution early) I started dieting like a true bodybuilder. Eggs, oats, chicken, rice, veggies, lean red meat, whey, Greek yogurt, fruit, etc. I rarely strayed from the path. I wish I had better progression pics, but my iphone with all of them was stolen like two months ago. So here is my most dramatic before and after.... wait for it.

[HERE!](http://imgur.com/a/IL84h#11)

I hope you all enjoyed my little story. I'll ask questions if you got em. Here are some other shots of my bod too.

Would someone here be a mentor/ virtual trainer? I know I will never be show quality, but I would like to enjoy a healthier body and hopefully look better with less clothing. PM me. I am ready to start. I have access to a gym and good vitamin/ supplement stores if need be. I can cook and know how to lift.

.......................................................................................................................................................
Listen, I'm older now guys; when I was young- 15/16/17. I worked out, I bought shit tons of supplements. Creatine, protein, PWO's, MV's, test boosters, everything they marketed to try to get bigger. Didn't work.

I got older, I learned that when I was a kid, my diet was not right (even though I THOUGHT it was at the time), my training was messy with bad form and not well-thought out, I spent too much time drinking, doing drugs, and not sleeping well.

So what did I do? I fixed my diet, I made it PERFECT, I got help and got a perfect work-out plan, I dropped the constant drinking, dropped ALL the supplements except some protein and multi-vitamins, quit drugs, I got my life together. And what happened? I GREW, I got more results in two months, than I did all throughout high school.

I am no longer natural now, but my point is; you do not NEED all these new supplements, you NEED PROPER TRAINING, PERFECT DIET AND A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE, if you have all these than: myself, and all experienced members here can vougue that you will grow. I promise.

I was a lanky 162lb-ish kid in highschool with maybe 11% BF. While natural, with the above info I had learned - I got too 189lbs and 10%BF in a matter of only a year.

After my first cycle, I got too 223lbs at 9%BF.

What am I rambling about?

**Quit wasting your money and being cocky thinking you're too big shit to ask for help and you think you know everything, there's a reason your still small. Ask for proper help, research and do what I said above.**

I snagged a copy of their new album, which I've grow fond of, and I was listening to it while getting swole. I hit the incline bench and I was doing high reps trying to bang out 15-20 reps of 155lbs and right as I get to about rep 13 the song hits the chorus and as I'm breathing out I yell ""YOURRRRR DESOLATIONNNN!!!"". Not fully knowing I had just screamed it at the top of my lungs, since the music was turned up pretty high. I finish my set and I turn to see two of the trainers staring at me as well as 3 old ladies who were using resistance bands on the yoga mats. I took out my earbuds apologized sincerely, and went about the rest of my workout quietly.

I was slightly embarrassed but also felt pretty alpha. I usually joke around with the personal trainers now when I walk by.

How about you guys?

Edit: Damn you guys responded quick. I posted this, went to the gym, and came back to this. You guys rock.

Edit 2: [Here's the song for those of you who are curious.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dNEtNUBdkA) The chorus is at 1:18, I yelled it out in a pretty similar manner."	t5_2ql8s	True

1376508923.0	1kda82	Update: Trouble activating lats--advice?	BantamBasher135	109	13	45	"From this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/bodybuilding/comments/1k5xn6/trouble_activating_latsadvice/

**Edit: There have been quite a few comments saying something to the effect of ""I just pull my shoulders back/activate my lats/do a reverse shrug and then go"". While this might work for most, the point of my original post and this follow up was that ""simply"" activating my lats before going did not work for me, and my arms/shoulders would take over throughout the motion. This post is designed to showcase some of the comments from my previous post which told me *how* to activate them, instead of just saying to do so.**

So today was back day, and yet again I am in awe of this community. So in order to give back, I'd like to mention the things that worked so other might benefit. This turned into a really long post, but I hope it might help some who might be having the same troubles as me.

**Pulldowns/pullovers**

&gt;/u/SoMuchTimeWasted

&gt;*Have you done straight-arm pull-downs with the rope?*

and
&gt;/u/Yayyuh

&gt;*Alternatively, you can try to pre-exhaust your lats by starting back day with machine pullovers.*

Not having a pullover machine in my gym I opted to try the pulldown/overs with the lat pull to start out. I found that taking a wide grip on the bar and arching my back at the peak of extension really helped to target my lats.


**Narrow hammer-grip pulldowns**

&gt;/u/Yayyuh

&gt;*The thing that works best for me in that regard is lat pulldowns with the triangle bar*

I did a 3x6/8/10 drop-superset with this and the before mentioned straight arm pulldown/overs. Both together pretty much destroyed my serratus and forward lats before I'd even gotten to the pulls.

**Eccentrics**

&gt;/u/ethan_houser

&gt;*I usually pull down and do a 4 second eccentric all WHILE shoving out. Do it at a very light weight to activate.*

Absolutely awesome. I bumped my weights down and focused on keeping tension throughout a 5-second release, following generally a 2-1-5 motif. Lightening the load and slowing things down allowed me to focus on placing the tension on my lats rather than my arms and shoulders.

And finally but probably most significantly-

**Grip and focus on pulldowns**

&gt;/u/iseeyoutroll

&gt;*what COMPLETELY changed my back workouts is thinking of pulling ""from the elbow.""*

&gt;/u/ethan_houser

&gt;*If you are doing pulldowns, i want you to think about shoving your hands out.*

&gt;/u/schnidlewasher

&gt;*when doing lat pulldowns, pull your hands away from each other right before and during the lift.*

and

&gt;/u/PavidDagan 

&gt;*I feel my lats a lot more with a thumbless lat pulldown.*

Firstly, apparently my shoulders are a little more broad than I gave them credit for. A wider grip was required to make all of this work. Secondly, I am a small guy (5'3"" and 145lbs), so what I found is that I tend to straighten my back and anchor my weight(such as it is) through my legs and hips. Maybe this won't help you bigger guys much, but maybe it will. I'm not getting any bigger, so it rests on you to determine that. :)

Using the above advice, I found that to actually pull (outwards) from the elbow, I needed to arch and relax my lower back completely. I even ended up tucking my legs behind me just to take them out of the  equation. This forced me to take all the weight onto my upper back--and with the wide thumbless grip this meant my lats rather than my rhomboids.

It was torture.

I didn't want to stop.

Thank you again, /r/bodybuilding. Sorry for the long post.

Now I wouldn't like for such people to stop posting all together as that's not the goal of this, but I would like for such posters to list their experience in bodybuilding (possibly in their flair) so other readers know that their advice is suited to their level of practice or simply to show that what has worked for them is something that could work for someone else within the same level of experience.

This is something I'd like to be implemented in hopes of some amateur bodybuilder planning to compete and has been training for 5+ years and is inquiring about furthering his leg growth doesn't get a response from someone doing starting strength and being told that squats is all he needs because that's what has given him superior gains to everything else he's done in his 5 months of training. Or at least that's my example.

I'm sure some of you can think of a time when you've read some advice, tips, or stories of how their training, diet, or X results changed when they started doing something else. Now wouldn't you all think differently if you knew the poster saying all this had only 3 months of actual experience or has been training seriously for 5+ years and even competed? We would all be able to tell if certain advice still applied to us or if it was better suited for a different trainee.

Well at least that's my idea. Thoughts on doing something like this?
