&gt; This world with all the created things in it has a certain order and solid construction. It shows nexuses between causes and things caused, combinations of some parts of creation with others, and transformations of some existent things into others, in a pattern that is both remarkable and endless.

&gt; One should then take a look at the world of creation. It started out from the minerals and progressed, in an ingenious, gradual manner, to plants and animals. The last stage of minerals is connected with the first stage of plants, such as herbs and seedless plants. The last stage of plants, such as palms and vines, is connected with the first stage of animals, such as snails and shellfish which have only the power of touch. The word 'connection' with regard to these created things means that the last stage of each group is fully prepared to become the first stage of the newest group.

&gt; The animal world then widens, its **species become numerous**, and, in a gradual process of creation, it finally leads to man, who is able to think and reflect. **The higher stage of man is reached from the world of monkeys**, in which both sagacity and perception are found, but which has not reached the stage of actual reflection and thinking. At this point we come to the first stage of man. This is as far as our (physical) observation extends."	t5_2qkdk	True

The reason we've decided to create the sub is that while anthropology falls under a number of already established Q&amp;A subs (/r/AskScience, /r/AskSocialScience, /r/AskHistorians) and also has some generic ones devoted to it (/r/Anthropology, /r/Archaeology), questions about it aren't quite *comfortable* in any of them and often go unanswered or poorly answered. The sub will be run along the same lines as other Ask... subreddits (particularly /r/AskHistorians, where I'm a mod) and we've already started to build a panel of experts by poaching their anthropologically-minded flaired users.

So please do come by, subscribe, and ask any questions you can think of to help us get the sub off the ground. And of course we also need people who know their stuff to come and answer them!"	t5_2qkdk	True

You can't put a bird on a bag because you think birds are pretty - It has to be a symbolic representation of the great sky dragon-turkey. Lapis Lazuli *must* represent the sky-god because it's blue. Dancing *must* be a reenactment of some bit of cultural mythology or other. 

It creates a picture of Other peoples as incredibly stuffy, rigidly unimaginative, and completely incapable of creative expression. If you believe the anthropologists Other people never do anything just because it's *fun*.

To my ears it reeks of Noble Savagery and other bollocks that has been more or less discredited over the years.For whatever reason, though, the idea that all Savages have an inherent nobility has been set aside, but the idea that all Savages live in a world of constant ritual, ceremony, and ridiculous stuffy formalism that would bore Catholics.

I read Collapse when I was 15 and largely credit it to my interest and involvement in the field. I recently was a student of his for a few months and most of his teachings were anthropological and cultural geographically in nature. He takes a very multi-faceted approach which is one of the things I enjoy about him most, and he's incredibly well versed in anthropology and anthropological theory. 

I understand that he writes ""pop science"", in that he makes it more digestible by the public, which veers away from firm academia, naturally. I think he's done wonderful things for the science world and has gotten a lot of people interested in social sciences. He's brought a lot of attention to less known fields. 

Mention of his name, even at UCLA, is met with a lot of disdain. A few of my professors have expressed that he over classifies things, and thus pigeon holes them. Dr. Diamond always spoke in opposition of over classifying, and that there is no ultimatum or right answer in cultural disciplines. Some have called him a hack and a ""fake scientist"" who perpetuates bad research and theory standards. 

Perhaps I'm just naïve and stupid, but I'm interested in why he's met with such anger in our field. My own experiences with him contradict all of the criticism I hear about him, but I understand and am totally receptive to much of what people say about him. What are your thoughts?"	t5_2qkdk	True

Being studying Taoism, Buddhism(Hinduism) and Shamanism, I've seen many similarities between them all when it comes to nature and feeling the world/humans as ""one"". These all ""religions"" share the same idea of balance in nature. What makes this interesting, is that the part of Shamanism I've studied about stems from Nordic culture (being from Finland myself, I've been reading mostly about the local Shamanism practiced in history) where was very little contact with the outside, global world. Shamanism was practiced here in dispersed settlement areas (at the time the Northern parts were all like that, I presume), so I guess these ideas had no impact from Buddhism or Taoism or some similar religion.

So, I'm highly interested in that is it something very biological, coded deep inside in people, which makes people to have feelings of ""being one with nature"" or seeing the nature and people as a whole? Nowadays many people are *really* disconnected from their surroundings, e.g. individualism is gaining ground everywhere and many people feel they're separate subjects just flowing in this objective world. This is the opposite of what these ""religions"" are saying. So, what awakens in very different parts of the world the same feeling of the universe being in balance and people being one with nature - the feeling that many people nowadays can't feel anymore? I've pondered it could be that:

-human beings in naked nature, being in constant interaction within the wilderness, feel something ""bigger"" in the nature than people nowadays living inside four walls and working in office cubicles

*this is something I've sometimes felt too, sitting in the midst of iced lake in a cold and dark winter night you can truly get the feeling that you're breathing with the nature

-DRUGS. Not the least! Hinduism is the root of Buddhism and what I've understood, Hinduism is affected by hallucinogens (I've even heard a theory that a cow is holy animal in India due to that magic mushrooms are used to grow from it's poop, don't know the truth). Shamans were known to use magic mushrooms (amanita muscaria) in their rituals too, to fall into trance. Other people in Northern parts used mushrooms too, not only shamans. As we know, especially psychedelics can make people feel one with everyone and with the whole world today too. So could it be that using psychedelics could have awakened the same beliefs/philosophies in different parts of the world and formed a part of these ""religions""?

&gt; Fossils from two caves in southwest China have revealed a previously unknown Stone Age people and give a rare glimpse of a recent stage of human evolution with startling implications for the early peopling of Asia. The fossils are of a people with a highly unusual mix of archaic and modern anatomical features and are the youngest of their kind ever found in mainland East Asia. Dated to just 14,500 to 11,500 years old, these people would have shared the landscape with modern-looking people at a time when China's earliest farming cultures were beginning.

And:

['Earliest writing' found in China](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2956925.stm)

&gt; Signs carved into 8,600-year-old tortoise shells found in China may be the earliest written words, say archaeologists.

&gt; The symbols were laid down in the late Stone Age, or Neolithic Age.

&gt; They predate the earliest recorded writings from Mesopotamia - in what is now Iraq - by more than 2,000 years.

&gt; The archaeologists say they bear similarities to written characters used thousands of years later during the Shang dynasty, which lasted from 1700-1100 BC.

As of last May there is now strong evidence to support the theory neanderthals (and a number of other hominids) recently admixed (~30-50kya) with humans.  Most modern human populations seem to have between 3% and 6% introgressed DNA, but the distribution is not necessarily even:


[Genetic and Phenotypic Consequences of Introgression Between Humans and Neanderthals](http://goo.gl/mE3Ch) (Nov 2011)

&gt; *VII. Different Regions of the Neanderthal Genome are Found in Different Modern Humans*


I think that the dust has had enough time to settle, and now might be a good time to have a post-[paradigm shift](http://goo.gl/AnigG) discussion that would have been politically incorrect two years ago (and *wouldn't* have been politically incorrect fifty years ago, and *would* have been... etc).  **Are there any historical accounts of mythical or phenotypically divergent humans that might have been hybrids, or possibly 100% Neanderthals?**   Historical attempts at linking contemporary populations to ""archaic"" lineages have been largely motivated by ethnocentrism and racism (e.g. Jews, Basques, Roma, Irish, etc.), but this was clearly not the case with the recent discovery that [Melanesians are 6% Denisovan](http://goo.gl/8wTQm) (or that [certain pygmy groups might have admixed ancestry](http://goo.gl/J2MxN)).  Individual humans [are ancestral mosaics](http://goo.gl/H6XzC); there's even evidence that stable phenotypic variation is maintained *within* populations many generations after admixture, which might explain why interesting people are often a little funny looking (e.g. [Steve Wozniak](http://i.imgur.com/y2zfq.jpg) probably has a little genius-caveman in him).

##[Hyperborea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperborea)

&gt; In Greek mythology the Hyperboreans were a mythical people who lived far to the north of Thrace. The Greeks thought that Boreas, the North Wind, lived in Thrace, and that therefore Hyperborea was an unspecified region in the northern lands that lay beyond the north wind. Their land, called Hyperborea or Hyperboria — ""beyond the Boreas"" — was perfect, with the sun shining twenty-four hours a day, which - if true - suggests a possible location within the Arctic Circle.

**Evidence:**

[Last Neanderthals Near the Arctic Circle?](http://goo.gl/yxeG4) (May 13, 2011)

&gt; Remains found near the Arctic Circle characteristic of Mousterian culture have recently been dated at over 28,500 years old, which is more than 8,000 years after Neanderthals are thought to have disappeared. This unexpected discovery by an international multi-disciplinary team, including researchers from CNRS, challenges previous theories. Could Neanderthals have lived longer than thought? Or had Homo sapiens already migrated to Europe at that stage?

---

##[Nephilim](http://goo.gl/AVbup)

&gt; The Nephilim (plural) are the offspring of the ""sons of God"" and the ""daughters of men"" in Genesis 6:4, or giants who inhabit Canaan in Numbers 13:33

From Genesis:

&gt; ""There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare [children] to them, the same [became] mighty men which [were] of old, men of renown.""

**Evidence:**

The admixture seems to have involved only male archaics (at least in surviving lineages).  This is evident from sequenced Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA (which doesn't appear in any known modern populations), and may be indicative of [a larger pattern of mostly male human genetic introgression](http://goo.gl/vUGuo) (and perhaps of [an even more fundamental eukaryotic functional division](http://goo.gl/4V7Af)).

##[Satyr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyr)

&gt; In Greek mythology, satyrs are a troop of male companions of Pan and Dionysus — ""satyresses"" were a late invention of poets — that roamed the woods and mountains. In myths they are often associated with pipe-playing.

...

&gt; Attic painted vases depict mature satyrs as being strongly built with flat noses, large pointed ears, long curly hair, and full beards, with wreaths of vine or ivy circling their balding heads.

...

&gt; Satyrs acquired their goat-like aspect through later Roman conflation with Faunus, a carefree Italic nature spirit of similar characteristics and identified with the Greek god Pan....Mature satyrs are often depicted in Roman art with goat's horns, *while juveniles are often shown with bony nubs on their foreheads.*

...

&gt; They roam to the music of pipes (auloi), cymbals, castanets, and bagpipes, and they love to dance with the nymphs (with whom they are obsessed, and whom they often pursue), and have a special form of dance called sikinnis.

**Evidence:**

Neanderthals evolved divergent craniofacial features (including enormous brow ridges) and, in all likelihood, more body hair.  There is also [evidence](http://goo.gl/kNfvt) that they underwent different phases of cognitive development (entirely skipping sapiens' ""globularization"" of the social brain during adolescence).  Male pattern baldness is X-linked, sex-biased, more common among Eurasians and 100% genetic.  If someone says it's a stretch to link it to archaic admixture, they probably haven't read the most recent literature (Neanderthals carried a variant of the gene SRD5A2 which ""catalyzes the conversion of the male sex hormone testosterone into the more potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone."").

The ""[Neanderthal flute](http://goo.gl/GpVOG)"" (originally considered a highly controversial discovery, but that was before we knew about the admixture)

&gt; In 1995, Ivan Turk found an approximately 43,100 year-old juvenile cave bear femur at the Divje Babe site, near a Mousterian hearth. Because it has characteristics of a flute, he has called it the ""Neanderthal flute"".

**[Almas](http://goo.gl/61wJa)** (suggested by MilhoVerde)

&gt; Myra Shackley and Bernard Heuvelmans have speculated that the Almases are a relict population of Neanderthals, while Loren Coleman suggests surviving specimens of Homo erectus. They have been connected to the Denisova hominin.

---

**[Fomorians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomorians)**  (suggested by AllegraGeller)

&gt; In Irish mythology, the Fomoire (or Fomorians) are a semi-divine race said to have inhabited Ireland in ancient times. They may have once been believed to be the beings who preceded the gods, similar to the Greek Titans.

*Possible early hybrid civilizations:*

##Ancient Egypt

[Skeletal dysplasia in ancient Egypt](http://goo.gl/hI04E):

&gt; Many aspects of ancient Egyptian culture, including the existence of skeletal dysplasias, and in particular achondroplasia, are well known through the monuments and records that survived until modern times. ... The oldest dwarf skeleton, the Badarian skeleton (4500 BCE), possibly represents an epiphyseal disorder...The purpose of this second historical review is to add to that knowledge with an expanded contribution. The artistic documentation of people with skeletal dysplasia from ancient Egypt is plentiful including hundreds of amulets, statues, and drawing on tomb and temple walls. **Examination of artistic reliefs provides a glance of the role of people with skeletal dysplasia and the societal attitudes toward them. Both artistic evidence and moral teachings in ancient Egypt reveal wide integration of individuals with disabilities into the society.**

[Molecular mechanisms of polyploidy and hybrid vigor](http://goo.gl/XwoH1):

&gt; For the genetically viable hybrids, **the degree of heterosis is proportional to the genic differences in two parental strains**. In other words, the levels of heterosis increase as the genetic distances between the parents increase. After evaluating the phenotypic data from 37 genera ... E.M. East (1936) noted that interspecific hybrids generally show more heterosis than intraspecific hybrids, if the genetic difference between the species or genera does not prevent them from forming compatible hybrids. The hybrids formed between different subgenera show more heterosis than the hybrids formed between species within the same subgenera. **If the hybrids are incompatible, they are dwarf and stunted, probably because dramatic differences in growth and reproductive development inherited from the divergent parents fail to be reconciled.**

##Ancient Britain

&gt; Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument located in the English county of Wiltshire...composed of a circular setting of large standing stones set within earthworks. It is at the centre of the most dense complex of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments in England, including several hundred burial mounds.

[Mammoths used as food and building resources by Neanderthals: Zooarchaeological study applied to layer 4, Molodova I (Ukraine)](http://goo.gl/KZcmU) (Nov 2011) 

&gt; The presence of series of striations and ochre on mammoth bones are associated with a technical or symbolic use. **Furthermore, mammoth bones have been deliberately selected (long and flat bones, tusks, connected vertebrae) and circularly arranged.** This mammoth bone structure could be described as the basement of a wooden cover or as a wind-screen. The inner presence of fifteen hearths, lithic artifacts and waste of mammal butchery and cooking is characteristic of a domestic area, which was probably the centre of a residential camp recurrently settled. **It appears that Neanderthals were the oldest known humans who used mammoth bones to build a dwelling structure.**

(Help please, influences are Foucault, Sandage and Salecl.)	neoliberaldaschund	77	19	38	"Hello! This is an idea that I've been thinking about a lot lately and I was wondering if you could give me some direction/people to study that might have some relevance to this topic.

My thesis is that male depression as a phenomenon in 21st century American society is an inevitable outcome of contradictory narratives surrounding gender, choice and achievement. What do I mean by this. There are a number of downright inconsistencies in the stories that we tell ourselves about achievement. Using sports as an example that boys encounter early in their lives, the winner of a game of baseball goes to the team that trained the hardest. Losing in this way is not just not ideal, it's a mark against your character. It's unacceptable to lose, even though the game requires there to be one loser for every winner. Somehow it's a widely held belief that everyone has the capacity to rise up past everyone else and if you fail to do so it's a mark on you. I hate to be the bearer of bad news but this a fantasy. Not everyone can better than everyone. It just butts up against the laws of reality. 

This idea of actualizing your desires in the world to make it your own taps into the male identity. A successful male is one who can make his will manifested in reality. **Choice is then this incredible metaphor for explaining literally every behavior in human society.** Men, along with women, choose every aspect of their lives, how they dress, eat, associate, and define themselves. In the process of choosing yourself and bringing yourself into being as the object of your own creation, you fulfill this choice ritual and reaffirm that anything is possible with choice and free will. But given the ubiquity of the choice narrative and the shame of ""choosing to lose"", there's a segment of the population who start to develop problems to this whole ""choice circus"", and those are depressed people. 

I think it's very telling that depressed people are ashamed of being depressed, they want to snap themselves out it, they want to believe in their ability to achieve again. It's so sad to watch them try and fail again, and what's worse is that they do this alone. If they don't buy into the cult of achievement, we disown them and let them hash it all out in their bedrooms and their minds. We disown them, absolutely.

The final twist comes in the rehabilitation process. The ""cure"" for depression comes down to something like ""an attitude tune up,"" whereby their shaken assumptions about free will need to be reinforced and reinvigorated. Through steady medication, psychotherapy, and other ways, the patient is then led to believe that he can achieve again in some way. He can then say that those feelings of helplessness are past him and go on with his life.

Does this spark anything with you? Please let me know, this is a bit of a barebones type of gist just to get across what I'm talking about, and any comments are appreciated. Thank you!"	t5_2qkdk	True

And the desire to stop this trend is understandable. But our job is not to preserve culture, but to study it, understand where it came from, and see where it may be going. I understand some cultures lose their languages from other reasons, but a major factor is the individuals choices in what they teach their children to help them succeed in the world (this is the one I'm talking about).

In all reality in an increasingly globalized world, it becomes incredibly impractical to have each culture maintain their own unique languages. 3-4 languages will inevitably beat out the rest, and this is OK. Coptic, Sanskrit, Latin, and thousands of other languages have gone extinct, this is natural and in a way beautiful. It demonstrates the adaptability of our species. Humans around the world recognized that their languages are losing the globalization battle so they adopt another major one. 

This part is less ""scientific"" but more my opinion. If humans ever want to work closer together and put our petty differences behind us language barriers are one of the things we need to break down. If someone needs to learn 3 languages to speak to anyone on Earth more can be accomplished. I'm not saying diversity is bad, I personally speak 6 languages, I'm only saying we need to try and study this shift less from an alarmist perspective but as a form of human adaptability.

TL;DR - the death of languages is a testament to human adaptability to changing geopolitical forces. It should not be feared, but studied as a form of adaptation.

[Genetic factors predisposing to homosexuality may increase mating success in heterosexuals](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513808000688) (2007)

&gt; We show that psychologically masculine females and feminine men are (a) more likely to be nonheterosexual but (b), when heterosexual, have more opposite-sex sexual partners. With statistical modelling of the twin data, we show that both these relationships are partly due to pleiotropic genetic influences common to each trait. We also find a trend for heterosexuals with a nonheterosexual twin to have more opposite-sex partners than do heterosexual twin pairs. Taken together, these results suggest that genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population."	t5_2qkdk	True

&gt; ASDs (autism spectrum disorders) are hypothesized as one of many adaptive human cognitive variations that have been maintained in modern populations via multiple genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Introgression from ""archaic"" hominids (adapted for less demanding social environments) is conjectured as the source of initial intraspecific heterogeneity because strict inclusive fitness does not adequately model the evolution of distinct, copy-number sensitive phenotypes within a freely reproducing population.

&gt; Evidence is given of divergent encephalization and brain organization in the Neanderthal (including a ~1520 cc cranial capacity, larger than that of modern humans) to explain the origin of the autism subgroup characterized by abnormal brain growth.

&gt; Autism and immune dysfunction are frequently comorbid. This supports an admixture model in light of the recent discovery that MHC alleles (genes linked to immune function, mate selection, neuronal ""pruning,"" etc.) found in most modern human populations come from ""archaic"" hominids.

1335756362.0	sz6pk	A message to student Anthropologists (re: ANTH being a less-than-worthy major in the employment field)		66	8	31	"*I am the president of my school's Anthropology Student Association, and some recent conversations led me to believe that such a note should be written.  I posted this to the group earlier today.  This is applicable to everyone, of course.*

There's been some chatter about a recent listing of ""worthless"" majors: Anthropology made that list. Yesterday one form of explanation was given: [http://nyti.ms/J3AIqP](http://nyti.ms/J3AIqP). Bruni makes some good points, mainly about the economy.

However, he misses entirely a series of points that are incredibly pertinent to our case (and to some extent he even mocks us). As students of anthropology (and philosophy, for that matter), we are being trained not necessarily with practical, hand-work skills, but rather with talents that aid us in connecting with people. We are taught to understand cultural and ethical relativism, aspect functionalism, and the importance of discerning the etic and emic.

My favorite teacher in high school, Mrs. Bernard, who taught history and government classes, once gave a spiel to our AP Human Geography class about this very topic. The class was mostly seniors, so we were all looking forward to our college transition and possible majors. Mrs. Bernard asked us which we would prefer, a CEO who has been trained solely in economics and business practices since undergrad, or a CEO who majored in anthropology for UG and then went on to study business practices.

After some discussion, we realized that the latter was much more appealing choice. The latter CEO has both the academic and practical training to efficiently and effectively run a company: this CEO knows how to talk with and interpret each and every employee, but also knows how to run a business with prestige and competition. This CEO understands why certain employees will do certain things at certain times during the day or year, or why a concept might not get through to other employees; with a background in both the social sciences and in business, this CEO will be able to take a step back, reflect on the *why,* the *who,* and the *what,* and then go forward and address the *how.*

Don't get discouraged by these articles which claim that what we're studying is for naught; we will learn - and many of us are doing this even now - how to actively address current and future issues with our education. Even at UMD we have projects and professors addressing labor (Dr. Shackel and Mike Roller), immigration (Dr. Brighton and Dr. Chambers), health (Dr. Freidenberg and Dr. Whitehead), environmental (Dr. Chernela, Dr. Paolisso, and Dr. Shaffer), and our region's vibrant and vital history (Dr. Leone). There are anthropologists scattered around the campus in so many different majors it should not be a surprise when we encounter one in a new lecture hall next semester.

Getting through our four years will be tough, but once we're through we will all have the learned abilities to apply what we know to so many other fields . . . it'll be like Anthropologists took over the world with one generation."	t5_2qkdk	True

I put this down to what I called the 'curse of anthropology', which I defined as; the more you understand about culture, the less people you can talk with about it without having them think you're crazy.

I guess the anthropologists job is to overcome this barrier by being able to express themselves clearly, but as an undergraduate student, I find myself overwhelmed by this process of willingly seeing what cannot be unseen, so to speak.

Now everywhere I look my first thought is, ""Wow, people are so weird!""

I began to question everything anthropologically. I took my questioning to my religion, and lost it. I took my questioning to the social structure of university and degrees, and anthropology itself, and after reading what I thought were some pretty bullshit journal articles the only thing I could reconcile the academic BS with was a sense of ethnocentrism emanating from the core of anthropology, which led me to defer my study while I got my head around it. I was very passionate about anthropology and I still am, but as much as I want to, I can't work out how to move forward with it now.

So my question is, how do you get on with your life when you're stuck at questioning everything and are consumed with thinking just how weird you and everyone you know is?

---

[It's related to Greek, Italian, French, and Egyptian ancestry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton%27s_toe):

&gt; It has a long association with disputed anthropological and ethnic interpretations. Morton called it Metatarsus atavicus, considering it an atavism recalling prehuman grasping toes. In statuary and shoe fitting it has been called the Greek foot (as opposed to the Egyptian foot, where the great toe is longer). A longer second toe has often been associated with royalty, particularly during the rule of the Ptolemaic dynasty when Egypt was under Greek rulership. It was an idealized form in Greek sculpture, and this persisted as an aesthetic standard through Roman and Renaissance periods and later (the Statue of Liberty has toes of this proportion). There are also associations found within Celtic groups. The French call it commonly pied grec (just as the Italians call it piede greco), but sometimes pied ancestral or **pied de Néanderthal**.

---

[Neanderthals had it (according to the late Stan Gooch)](http://www.scribd.com/doc/76942532/The-Way-We-Are):

&gt; All Neanderthal fossil feet and fossil footprints have the big toe shorter than the second toe. All Cro-Magnon fossil feet and fossil footprints show the big toe longer than the second toe.

Digit ratio differs between closely related primates, and indicates [polygyny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygyny):

[Digit ratios predict polygyny in early apes, Ardipithecus, Neanderthals and early modern humans but not in Australopithecus](http://www.scribd.com/doc/62022251/) (Nov 2010)

---

This is probably because it's linked to fetal androgen exposure, which is involved in primate social bonding:

[Finger Length Ratios (2D:4D) in Anthropoids Implicate Reduced Prenatal Androgens in Social Bonding](http://www.scribd.com/doc/49488854/) (2010)

&gt; Relationships between 2D:4D and sexual selection have been shown at the population-level (Manning et al., 2000; 2003a; 2004a) and demonstrate that within ethnic groups male and female ratios are highly correlated, but between populations the ratios of males and females in some groups appear more masculinized than the ratios of other groups. Manning (2008) proposed that population differences may be linked to marriage systems and levels of polygyny. High competition between males for females, as is found in polygynous systems, could lead to selection for high PAE (Manning et al., 2004b; Manning,2008). High circulating androgens promote male competitive behavior (Klein, 2000) and mechanisms facilitating dominance and aggression may be most adaptive in populations where males experience strong competition for access to females (Grey, 2003). In addition, in species that experience high competition for resources (mates and food), exposure to high prenatal androgens may also be important in supporting female social hierarchies(Ostner et al., 2003; Dloniak et al., 2006).On the basis of the associations between 2D:4D and sex-linked traits, Fink et al. (2006) proposed that variation in human 2D:4D should be viewed within a framework of sexual selection theory. Demonstrating relationships between 2D:4D and levels of sexual competition in other species would extend this conclusion.

[Digit ratio is also linked to autism](http://goo.gl/KaM31), and there are multiple discussions of Morton's toe on autism forums.

[A thread on wrongplanet.net](http://www.wrongplanet.net/postt76588.html):

&gt; I get a little preoccupied with the genetics of Asperger's; it runs down my father's side of the family like a shot (at least five generations). Lately I've noticed that many of the people around me have a Morton's toe (the second toe is longer than the big toe). This includes my best friend, my husband, two good friends, and myself. This is a recessive trait that only appears in 10% of the population or less. All of the parties involved are the children of professors, four have been diagnosed w/ ADD, ADHD, or Asperger's. I know it's a small sampling, but according to Freud, it only takes two sets of interrelated variables to produce a pattern. Quick poll--how many of y'all are both sportin' a Morton's toe and neurological variances?

I'm a cultural anthropologist and work in a large South American city, in fact there aren't any insurmountable problems in my living situation. I came here unfunded and have been using a meager unemployment insurance check to get by. I'm now in a situation where I'll need to either continue with my plan to get out or drop another 1000.00 plus dollars on getting an apartment rented (yeah it's that expensive here). This is problematic as I can't really afford to vacillate the way I am. 

 I go to a fairly prominent American university and have been guaranteed at least a teaching position upon my return. Problem is, as you all might know, a teaching job is straight up poverty wages and prospects in the job market at that time don't look particularly good.

 I imagine what I'm going through is normal, but I'm having a hard time justifying why I'm here, doing what I'm doing, seeing bleak prospects with or without a degree, in public, private, or university settings. I'm noticing a pretty well entrenched sense of depression setting in and am of course missing my people back home. 

I've moved my flight to about a week from now to return where frankly, I've not got anything other than a job I didn't like in the first place to return to. I'd be living with my girlfriend who has been a champ over the past 10 months or so dealing with all of my ups and downs. 

Scheider's only real advice to the ethnographer was to be sure to take a good break in the middle of fieldwork. 

I feel as if all of my dreams of finding stable employment were totally delusional and now I'm reaping the rewards of a pretty useless skill set. 

I'll just leave it here before I get too stream of conscious.

I know this is a topic often discussed here and it's very complicated in our field, but I have some questions about actually working in anthropology.  This is gonna be a long one, but what are we good at if not reading a shit ton?

**TL;DR Read it.  Feel free to answer only the questions I ask about you and your career, or answer questions to help me in my academic journey.  Just want to get a dialogue happening here and have some interesting conversations about your experiences in anthropology.**


 
**Questions about you:** (feel free to be a little vague here if you want to keep from revealing too much about yourself.  I would absolutely welcome private detailed messages from any of you if you'd like to chat!)

1) What is your job and what do you do there?  What is a typical day for you?

2) What is your education history?

3) If you went to grad school, how did you decide what to base your research on?  How did you decide which geographic region interested you the most?


**Quick background about me**:  I'm a senior in my undergrad, so I'm applying to grad schools this year.  Looking at programs has made me start thinking more about where my education will actually take me and what kind of job I actually want.

I am primarily interested in osteology, bioarchaeology, ecology, evolution, sex and sexuality, forensic anthropology, and anthropogenics (yeah...having some trouble narrowing things down).  

I love primatology and archaeology, but I know that constantly doing field work and/or traveling to exotic countries is not something my body could handle for health reasons.  I love forensic anthropology but I'm fully aware it isn't like it is portrayed on television and jobs are few and far between in this field.

I would love to have the opportunity to travel occasionally, and don't want to be relegated to only working in a lab - but I would like lab work and research to be my primary responsibilities.  I would love to teach others as far as publications and constantly doing research, but I am not particularly interested in being a professor.   

I will be going to grad school and hopefully starting my career in California with my primary geographic interests being the American West, Mexico, and Mesoamerica (also interested in francophone countries).  I haven't gotten the opportunity to do field schools because frankly, I can't afford them and now I don't have time as I'm graduating next spring and taking full time classes until then to make that happen.  I will likely be doing research this fall in bioarch and/or primate osteology, depending upon who offers what first.  

**Questions to help ME**: (if you answer these I will love you forever)

1) Does a job in anthropology exist that fits my needs and interests (see above)?  

2) What would you suggest to help me get to where I want to be?  Do you think a PhD is necessary for what I want to do?"	t5_2qkdk	True

Here's the pic:  (http://1760loghouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/bones.jpg)

Edit to re-paste comment from other thread:  

Originally we had assumed they were animal bones, my husband found them when he was installing the HVAC system and had to go into the crawlspace. We didn't think anything of it until the barn across the street, which was tied to this house originally, was sold by the owner and torn down last week. The man disassembling it was nice, and so we asked him to come take a look at what we had found. There are also pieces of pottery, rosehead nails, a piece of a wooden broom, and the coolest thing...a 1775 British half-penny! Anyway, he also had taken a look at the bones. He said he was previously a microbiologist, and he thought that they did not look like animal at all, but in fact HUMAN! The coroner for our county took them on Friday night, and we're supposed to hear back for certain one way or another probably tomorrow. Based on pictures on the internet like this(http://www.disabled-world.com/artman/uploads/vert.gif) we're now thinking that they could be human.

Edit again:  More pics here (http://1760loghouse.com/?page_id=28) taken on Thursday night.  Because I don't have the bones now, I cannot get new pics."	t5_2qkdk	True

1364009839.0	1auaux	Game Server Anthropology: Some thoughts so far over the culture and dynamics that exist in my running social experiment	spaceribs	49	6	22	"Me and my team host one of the larger apocalyptic style minecraft servers. It is an anarchy server, so there aren't really any other rules beyond no hacking. I've hosted this server for about a year now, and we're about to start a new season (complete wipe, new features and what I hope will be a better experience). If you'd allow me (not sure if this subreddit would welcome such a unorthodox study), I'd love to talk about it from a human experience perspective.

When I set up this server, I created certain rules that attempted to create an ecosystem in which the experience balanced itself against normal anarchy:

1. You cannot chat with other people normally, you have to be near them or call them using a rare item they may or may not have. This makes first spawn on the game a very solitary experience, you really have to fend for yourself or starve to death.
2. You can create radio beacons which can be locked onto by others, but that may invite people who could destroy your base and take the stuff you worked so hard to gather.
2. You randomly spawn within a huge map when you first get there and whenever you die, This made it very rare to meet other people while playing, and without usual lines of communication, you didn't know if they were there to kill you or be friends. This also meant you wouldn't be able to just get on and group up a friend immediately, you had to go through a serious ordeal to get anywhere near someone you knew.
3. On top of the normal environment, we've placed offices, apartments and hospitals in a state of decay. They are filled with items but are heavily guarded by monster spawners, making it extremely difficult to loot for items.

There has been heavy role-play around the ""zombie apocalypse"" experience, but getting past that, I've seen some recurring social themes:

1. **Groups tend to have a knack for destroying themselves:** This is one of the biggest themes so far. As soon as people become associated with a ""Group"" of any sort, they immediately enter otherness to everyone else. Until the others on the server, or a member of the group, corrects this social habit, they become infamous and eventually loathed. There has been cases where groups appear specifically to destroy the ""Famous"" group. The longest living groups on the server have a very loose structure or instead focus on a specific useful goal. One group, (called The Cable Company) focuses on connecting vast distances together, and they have survived on the server for quite a long time because the provided a service that everyone benefitted from.
2. **The most successful players seem to be the most anti-social:** Not to say they don't have social skills, but the wandering nomads on my server seem to have it made. If you can get to a point in which you become a skilled fighter with the resources to fend off others, you will become well known throughout the community. These nomads sometimes settle down with others of similar skill, but eventually reject it and continue on.
3. **Everyone wants to fix up the ruins, and no one gets away with it:** I have seen many groups take over an entire building and attempt to rebuild it. Within a few days it is completely looted/destroyed by others.
They are the perfect templates to rebuild society, but without someone constantly online to socially interact with newcomers, they take what they can and move on for their own survival.

We're going to be starting up a new map when we're done with development. I'd love to hear your feedback from an academic perspective, it's been an incredibly fun experience developing this and seeing what happens. You can view our history (in it's entirety) at our subreddit: /r/spaceribs.

2. I've heard that, if you're lucky enough to even get a position...essentially, there is no way to choose where you will live, ever. For example, I would like to live in a city. But, if you're looking for a professor position, it's so competitive that you have to take whatever is offered. Is this true?

* What jobs have you gotten?

* Where have you traveled?

* Some of your best experiences that happened as a result of your degree.

* What does the field look like in terms of opportunities to get a job, research grants, etc.?

* What's your favorite, and least favorite, part of the job.

* Last but not least, how much do you make? I understand some of you might not want to answer this. I'd be happy with a range, rather than an exact number. 

I wasn't sure where I should post this question, but I figured I would ask a subreddit dedicated to the subject. If there's somewhere else I'm supposed to post this, or a thread where this has been mostly answered, please point me in the right direction. Thanks

&gt; What Eia had done, was to first interview the Norwegian social scientists on issues like sexual orientation, gender roles, violence, education and  race, which are heavily politicized in the Norwegian science community. Then he translated the interviews into English and took them to well-known British and American scientists like Robert Plomin, Steven Pinker, Anne Campbell, Simon Baron-Cohen, Richard Lippa, David Buss, and others, and got their comments. **To say that the American and British scientists were surprised by what they heard, is an understatement.**

&gt; I looked recently at the Norwegian popular science television series ""Brainwashing."" In seven sections the Norwegian comedian Harald Eia explores the degree to which various differences between people can be attributed to biological or social factors.

[Race Taboo on TV](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=sv&amp;u=http://web.archive.org/web/00000000000000/http://www.dagsavisen.no/kultur/article480122.ece) 4/13/2010

&gt; We need to talk about taboo topics, without being branded as racists, say Shout editor Majoran Vivekananthan of ""Brainwashing"" fame.

&gt; For 17 years, gender research has been built up through its own research program in the Research Council. The last firårsperioden has been reduced by approx. 56 million for research in gender studies.

&gt; Last spring, Norwegian gender studied received massive criticism in connection with the NRK series Brainwashing. Trout believes part of the criticism has been real, and points out that there are many opinions about this even among sex researchers themselves. But the debate has damaged reputation of research.

[Great Interest in Brainwashing](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;u=http://www.aftenposten.no/kultur/Kjempeinteresse-for-Hjernevask-5320246.html) 3/3/2010

&gt; Curious and enthusiastic TV viewers bombarded Harald Eia and Ole Martin Ihle with questions during the chat with Aftenposten.no readers.

&gt; Are men more interested in sex than women? Some believe that this is true, some not. But what science says?

&gt; A person who has attempted to ascertain this is the Norwegian comedian and journalist Harald Eia. For more than a year since he took up this and several other sociological issues in a series of documentaries for NRK's ​​behalf. The series created a major debate about gender scientific culture. Now, during last autumn also put Norwegian counterpart to the Council closed its special focus on gender studies. Generally it is considered to be linked to EIAs TV programs.

1327763621.0	p0iq2	"""The most interesting genetic changes are surely those that change minds rather than bodies. And there are several lines of argument that suggest that the Neanderthals may have had something to contribute along those lines as well."""	Slartibartfastibast	38	1	2	"[The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution](http://www.pdf-archive.com/2012/01/23/the-10-000-year-explosion/the-10-000-year-explosion.pdf) [PDF]

From page 53:

&gt; The key point here is that it would take only a very limited amount of interbreeding for modern humans to have picked up almost every Neanderthal allele with any significant advantage. Limited interbreeding would mean that neutral genes in humans today would look almost entirely African—which they do—while at the same time we might carry a number of functional alleles that originated in Neanderthals. Those alleles would be ones that mattered, ones that made a difference.

...

&gt; The alleles most obviously worth stealing would be those that implemented adaptations to local conditions in Europe. That might mean, for example, acquiring the ability to tolerate cold weather, resist local diseases, or adjust to big swings in the length of the day over the course of a year (in contrast to the tropics, where the length of the day does not vary much). These kinds of adaptations, along with the more sophisticated, technological solutions to cold characteristic of modern humans, such as building shelters and so on, may have been important in human settlement of the far north, and eventually of the Americas.

&gt; These sorts of changes were important—adaptation to local climates and pathogens was obviously necessary for humans to succeed in northern climates. But on the whole, they are not all that interesting. Obviously, even penguins are better adapted to cold than humans. If that is all the Neanderthals had to offer, the question of interbreeding with them would not matter so much. **The most interesting genetic changes are surely those that change minds rather than bodies. And there are several lines of argument that suggest that the Neanderthals may have had something to contribute along those lines as well.**

&gt; Changing Minds

&gt; Neanderthals had developed larger brains during their time in Europe, just as modern human ancestors had in Africa (and to some extent as the archaic populations in Asia had as well). Those large brains paid off in increased fitness in both populations, else they’d never have come into existence, but **there may have been functional differences.**

From [Hominins and the Emergence of the Modern Human Brain](http://www.scribd.com/doc/79970775/):

&gt; Autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction for which a clinical definition is ongoing. is referenced in studies of fossil hominin brain structure and function, either as an analogy for developmental differences between closely related species **or as a potentially [atavistic](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/atavistic) indication of actual primitive phenotypes**. For example, an autistic child lacking language created naturalistic artwork much like that from the Upper Paleolithic, on the basis of which it was suggested that fAMHS could have also lacked fully modern cognition (Humphrey. 1998).

A_Bewlay_Brother	45	10	66	"I recently read [The Primacy of the Ethical by Scheper-Hughes](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2744051?seq=2) and thought it was very interesting. Does anyone have any knowledge on anthropologists that have written articles or texts about the relevance of advocacy and activism within anthropology? I'd love to look further into this matter.

And of course, what are your opinions /r/anthropology?

EDIT: I feel like the question might be vague so I'll try and elaborate the question by referring to parts of the article. Please get involved, I am genuinely curious for some more articles that relate to this idea (and oppose it) and of course your opinions on the matter.

In Schepher-Hughes' article (as linked above) she refers to her work in Northern Brazil (*Death Without Weeping*). According to Schepher-Hughes, the traditional role of the anthropologist is that of a ""neutral, dispassionate, cool and rational, objective observer of the human condition.""

Naturally activism opposes this view as it encourages involvement and to be politically and morally grounded instead of accepting moral relativism; therefore does activism belong in the realm of anthropology as a field? If so, why do you think so? If not, why not?"	t5_2qkdk	True

Could the mechanism behind DS be selected for (over huge timescales) during rare but extreme mass exposures to carcinogens (bogs, volcanoes, etc)?	hypothesis983	44	6	8	"The paper that led me to this hypothesis:

[Another reason to look for tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 21](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/%28SICI%291098-2264%28199801%2921:1%3C1::AID-GCC1%3E3.0.CO;2-5/abstract) (1998) in the journal *Genes, Chromosomes and Cancer*

&gt; If Sataka et al. (1997) are correct in suggesting that tumor suppressor genes of importance for the development of stomach cancer map to the long arm of chromosome 21, **we would expect a lack of such neoplasms in DS** through a gene dosage effect.  Down syndrome is caused by a duplication of the 21st chromosome, which contains many tumor suppression genes. **This is precisely what is observed. Furthermore, carcinomas of the esophagus, lung, and ovary are also rare in DS**, which would fit with the observations of loss of heterozygosity for 21q in these neoplasms.

Here are more papers that mention specific tumor suppression genes in chromosome 21:

* [Frequent allelic loss/imbalance on the long arm of chromosome 21 in oral cancer: evidence for three discrete tumor suppressor gene loci.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10523685)

* [A tumor suppressor is DSCRibed on chromosome 21](http://www.signaling-gateway.org/update/updates/200906/su-0906-1.html)

* [Role of chromosome 3p12–p21 tumour suppressor genes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma: analysis of VHL dependent and VHL independent pathways of tumorigenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1186920/)

A single chromosome duplication is essentially the largest [copy number variation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-number_variation) one can define.  Because these block-mutations just vary the copies of existing information (rather than adding new stuff) the less deleterious ones are now believed to be behind a lot of our species' phenotypic variation (in addition to SNPs).  My hypothesis is that very rare natural events that lead to cancer epidemics may strongly select for a simple mechanism that maintains, through meiotic hardware, a tumor-suppression phenotype.

Admittedly there might be strong selection *against* such a mechanism in any small group of humans, as people with down syndrome also have many physical and mental health issues (some of which, however, only manifest later in life).  But because the chromosome is transported whole, there isn't any loss of genetic information.  People with down syndrome are capable of having children without the condition, meaning they carry an intact human germline that is very resistant to a specific type of mass extinction event.

Even if it initially had no adaptive benefit, if the DS mechanism has existed for long enough then tumor suppression genes would still tend, through group selection, to cluster in a fashion that protects certain members of the species (using them to house the local genetic diversity) in the rare case of a carcinogenic disaster.  There's even some evidence that genes allowing longer dendrite formation and more plastic neurological functions, stuff that may have only recently come under strong selective pressure in humans, might have required the relaxing of certain anti-cancer functions."	t5_2qkdk	True

&gt; This paper presents a zooarchaeological study of large mammal remains from Molodova I layer 4, to understand the modalities of acquisition and utilization of mammoth resources for food and technical purposes, especially to test the hypothesis of using bones as building elements. The number of mammoths is estimated to at least fifteen individuals of all age classes and both sexes, which died during several episodes, near or on the site.

&gt; The taphonomic modifications due to weathering, water percolation and plant roots indicate the location of bones in holes, such as the pit and the basement of the circular accumulation. Secondary actions of carnivores, especially of hyaenid type, are rare on bones, showing that the assemblage was not accumulated by these predators. The anatomical preservation, the age and sex features and the taphonomic data indicate several modalities of mammoth acquisition by hunting, scavenging and collecting.

&gt; Based on anthropogenic marks, mammoth meat has been eaten. **The presence of series of striations and ochre on mammoth bones are associated with a technical or symbolic use. Furthermore, mammoth bones have been deliberately selected (long and flat bones, tusks, connected vertebrae) and circularly arranged.** This mammoth bone structure could be described as the basement of a wooden cover or as a wind-screen. The inner presence of fifteen hearths, lithic artifacts and waste of mammal butchery and cooking is characteristic of a domestic area, which was probably the centre of a residential camp recurrently settled. It appears that **Neanderthals were the oldest known humans who used mammoth bones to build a dwelling structure.**

Slartibartfastibast	36	2	8	"*Update: http://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropology/comments/mba6f/in_most_modern_human_populations_the_majority_of/*

----

The hypothesis of the evolutionary origin of bipolar disorder (EOBD) synthesized ideas about the biological clock and seasonal shifts in mood (Rosenthal, Wehr) with theorizing that bipolar disorder descends from a pyknic (compact, cold-adapted) group (Kretchmer). The hypothesis suggested that bipolar behaviors evolved in the northern temperate zone as highly derived adaptations to the selective pressures of severe climatic conditions during the Pleistocene. **Given evidence of Neandertal contributions to the human genome, the hypothesis is extended (EOBD-R) to suggest Neandertal as the ancestral source for bipolar vulnerability genes (susceptibility alleles). The EOBD-R hypothesis explains and integrates existing observations: bipolar disorder has the epidemiology of an adaptation; it is correlated with a cold-adapted build, and its moods vary according to light and season. Since the hypothesis was first published, data consistent with it have continued to appear.** Individuals with seasonal affective disorder, which is related to bipolar disorder, have been shown to manifest a biological signal of season change similar to that found in hibernating animals. The involvement of the circadian gene network in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder has been confirmed. Because selective pressures during the Pleistocene would have been greatest for women of reproductive age, they are expected to manifest winter depression more than males or younger females, which is the case. (This sex difference is also found in hibernating mammals.) Because it is hypothesized that the evolution of bipolar disorder took place in the northern temperate zone during the Pleistocene, it is not expected that individuals of African descent, lacking Neandertal genes, will manifest circular bipolar I disorder, and in fact, the incidence of bipolar disorder among black individuals is less than among whites. A definitive test of the hypothesis is proposed: It is predicted that the bipolar and Neandertal genomes will be more similar than the modern human and Neandertal genomes, and the modern human and San and Yoruba genomes will be more similar than the bipolar and San and Yoruba genomes. Failure to confirm these predictions will falsify the EOBD-R hypothesis. The EOBD-R hypothesis has important implications in the search for bipolar vulnerability genes and our understanding of ourselves and our Neandertal ancestor. At a practical level, confirmation of the EOBD-R hypothesis will boost interest and research in the prevention and management of bipolar symptoms by manipulation of ambient light.

However, when I look at pictures of hunter-gatherer peoples, they never have the slightest traces of beards. Since hunter gatherers don't exactly have access to razor blades, I began to suspect that the ethnicities being pictured (isolated people from Africa, America, East Asia etc) simply do not grow them.

Come to think of it, in my experience the only folks I've seen with significant beards are Indo-Europeans, people from the Arab World, and Australian Aborigines. It couldn't be an ancestral feature...but if the Australians have it, it must be very old, since they split off long ago...

This [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropology/comments/1ecxty/african_tribal_childrens_reaction_to_seeing_a/c9z3w06) had many people with indigenous American ancestry confirming that they couldn't grow beards.

I recently started Anthropologists Among Us (http://www.anthropologistsamongus.com/), and I'd love to get your thoughts and builds on it. The goal is to showcase and celebrate the stories of everyday anthropologists - those of us who studied anthropology, but did not take the academia route. I'd love to show prospective, current, and recent anthropology majors how a background in anthropology has shaped people's lives and careers. 

Personally, I studied anthropology as an undergrad, worked as a management and strategy consultant for about five years, and I now work as an innovation consultant. I'm incredibly thankful that I'm in a position where I actively use my background in anthropology in the context of innovation. 

To start, I'd love to profile the awesome members of this community who fit the profile! Please feel free to reach out to me if you'd love to share your story or know of someone who would be perfect for this. 

And I'd also love to learn what the students, here, think about this. What are you guys curious about, what keeps you up at night about your decision to study anthropology, etc. etc. 

Thanks for your help, guys. "	t5_2qkdk	True

FrankManic	34	2	8	"**NOTE: I am aware that I sound shrill, paranoid, and a little crazy. That said, I feel that information and data security is a valid concern for ethnographers, especially those working in regions where their informants might be in danger were their notes to fall into the hands of the authorities. Due to rapidly changing technology and policy old methods such as changing a few names will no longer suffice to garuantee the anonymity of an informant. We should proactively develop new methods of thwarting state and government attempts to weaponize anthropology. **


I'm reading Homegirls, by Norma Mendoza Denton, which deals with the lives of Latina girls living in the Bay Area in the mid 90's. All of the girls involved are vaguely part of the Nortenos and Surenos 'gangs', which Mendoza-Denton describes as being more loose social, ideological, and subcultural groups than the menacing criminal syndicates they are often portrayed as. 

Mendoza-Denton discusses at various points in the book the dangers of police or other authority figures misappropriating information from ethnographic researchers and using it as a weapon against youth who, already suffering from the day to day harassment to which all minorities are subject, are additionally burdened with the stigma of 'gang' membership. She describes situations where things as banal as the color of ones clothing or gang signs in a photograph can mean immediate deportation or prosecution, regardless of the actions, intentions, or criminality of the individual. 

So, that rambling aside, Ethnographic research can easily be misused as a weapon against marginalized people. 

And we live in a time where the US state and federal governments have unprecedented power to intercept, analyze, and synthesize all forms of digital and likely dead-tree communication, to a degree that is difficult for the average person to fully grasp and internalize. 

In a very real sense no form of communication can be considered anonymous or confidential. 

Rather than going off on more fear mongering, I ask the following; How can we, as ethnographers, rise to the challenges of the 21st century in order to protect our allies, our colleagues, our informants, from the repression and violence of state and non-state entities armed with information gathering technology that is omnipresent and difficult to detect or evade? 


- Imagine you're going to a mosque. You're talking to people. You're recording conversations. The FBI finds out. They break into your apartment while you're out, load a keylogger on to your machine, and from then on everything you do, say, record, or send is intercepted and viewed by the Feds. This is well within their means and similar devices have been used in (in my opinion) specious prosecutions of alleged 'terrorists'. 

People say disturbing things to Ethnographers. They may talk about criminal behavior, socially and politically unpopular ideas, or reveal their own immigration status. I am of the belief that the state has no issues or qualms what so ever of stealing this data without the knowledge or consent of anyone involved should they learn that such data exists.

1317131715.0	ksxlc	"Just listened to my professor go off on a thirty minute tirade about ""Eugenics"". So here's the thing. (RANT)"	FrankManic	42	11	17	"1.) Yes, people accuse Ev Psych and Ev Anthro of being ""social darwinism"".

2.) This is, mostly, bullshit. 

3.) It is innapropriate and unprofessional to teach a class of undergraduates that Eugenics was solely the purview of Nazi Party and the Imperial Japanese, that it is a uniformly evil and wrong minded policy, that it is a simple matter of the kind of forced sterilization and mass murder that were seen under mid 20th century fascism.

4.) Eugenics, at it's core, is the active manipulation of human genetics. State eugenics programs, such as those of the United States, which were in place in some states well into the 1970s, with the last legal forced sterilization apparently being performed in 1981. 

This professor is continually pandering to ludicrous idiocy from the American Religious Right that Darwinism is a cult, that Darwinism is psuedoscience, that Darwinism neccesarily leads to Naziism. His continuing and ongoing apologetics to the criticism of the ignorant and the superstitious is pathetic and does a disservice to his students. I am, frankly, disgusted by his conduct. To spend thirty minutes taking steps to associate the entire history of Eugenics solely with the Nazi ideology, ignoring all the many other aspects of the theory and implementation of Eugenics, does a disservice to his students. 

Tays-Sachs screening is eugenics. Downs syndrome screening is eugenics. Pre-natal sex screening is eugenics. Forced sterilization of promiscuous women is eugenics. Forced abortion of fetus with certain heritable genetic disorders is eugenics. Access to reproductive medicine is eugenics. Artificially assisted reproduction is eugenics. There are things that help people and things that harm people. Wonderful possibilities and terrible nightmares. 

I am disgusted that he takes something complex and difficult, something multifaceted, loaded with political and symbolic meaning, loaded with both terrible violence and burning hope, and makes it simple, declaring it, literally, in his own words, to be ""Evil.""

This is the language of ignorance. The language of hate. The language of polemics. Taking complex issues and reducing them to simple, emotional gut punches is how wicked men further wicked agendas. Hitler relied heavily on taking complex issues and reducing them to simple concepts that cut heavily to emotional impact. 

Ugh. This just disgusts me. By associating the idea so strongly with Naziism while speaking from a position of authority he taints the well. Rather than increasing the complexity and uncertainty of the world he cravenly surrenders to his own fear of popular criticism to make wildly inaccurate and overly simplified statements that closes the mind to rational inquiry, healthy skepticism, and learning based on facts rather than furthering an ideology, regardless of whether that Ideology is something as horrific as National Socialism or something as equivocal as Evolutionary Anthropology. 

I so want to stand up and walk out of this class but I need the fucking credits. This is not the only time he has behaved in this fashion. His 'Defense' of modern synthesis evolution is aimed solely at ameliorating the claims of willfully ignorant and flagrantly delusional right-wing religious ideologues. His 'Defense' positions him as fearful of extremist evangelicals, kowtowing to the most deliberately, intentionally, and shamelessly idiotic or ignorant aspects of our society. "	t5_2qkdk	True

1315072770.0	k3nxs	What is the evolutionary explanation for physical variation among ethnicities?		33	4	37	"I know that modern humans (Homo sapiens) evolved in Africa and migrated to various parts of the world around 60,000 - 150,000 years replacing other hominid species (such as  Neanderthals). The variation in skin, hair and colour among various people across the world is due to the presence of melanin; which is thought to have adapted to the sunlight intensity to produce vitamin D, thus people living near equatorial regions are dark skin and people further away from the equator are light skin such as the Nordic people (who also have a high percentage of blond haired people).

My question is thus, what is the evolutionary cause for other physical variations such as:
* People from East Asia have flat eyes.
* People from subcontinent Asia have more body hair than the general population. * Black athletes dominate running, even though they make up a small minority in developed countries and in African countries people do not have access to the infrastructure to support development of sports. * Why is there no variation in eye and hair colour among East Asian people even though their skin is light coloured. * People from the Asian continent are shorter in height when compared to overall population; and other such variations which cannot be attributed to the societal factors. 

I tried searching for evolutionary reasons for this and either came upon white supremacists masquerading as discussion sites such [majority rights](http://majorityrights.com/index.php/weblog/comments/the_evolution_of_blond_hair_and_blue_eyes_among_nordics/) or [others which just focus on the sports aspect](http://run-down.com/guests/je_black_athletes_p2.php)

I would really appreciate if a qualified individual could provide me with a scientific explanation for such variations (Also, please put the links of the sources for further information)

P.S. Pardon the editing and I do not consider any race (I did not want to use the word *race*) to be superior or inferior; the purpose of this question is to improve my knowledge on the evolution of human beings

At one point he took me up on a small, nondescript hill and we collected pottery shards off of the ground. The next few times I visited we did the same. Upon doing some research on the shards I learned that the collection of such was illegal and considered very harmful to anthropological efforts. After that I stopped collecting them, mainly due of the ethics rather than the legality of the practice.

My question is about just how much harm may have been done by my actions. All of the pieces found were laying on the surface of the ground. There was never any digging involved. The collection sites were all small hills scattered throughout the desert (mostly north and west of Sierra Ladrones, if you happen to know the area.) It seems to me that the likelihood of these sites ever being formally excavated are remote at best, so the shards that I picked up would almost certainly end up eroded into sand.

As I said, I stopped collecting shards once I learned of its reputation in anthropological circles. Despite my doubts about the effects of my actions, I care enough about research and learning to not want to take a chance on inhibiting it. I understand if the blanket condemnation of the practice is to discourage it in general, but what specific harm may have happened due to my collecting. 

For what it's worth, I'll not collect anymore, regardless of the answers I may receive here. But that brings up another interesting question. What do I do if I come across such a site in the future? Should it be reported to someone and if so, who?

Just for reference, I'm including a photo of a shadowbox I made with some of the shards I collected. This is maybe one fifth of the total that I have. If it matters at all, except on one occasion, I never found two pieces that matched up with another. That single instance it was pretty clear that the piece broke after being exposed by the elements.

Not_Brandon	34	4	9	"I just read an article [found here](http://windward.hawaii.edu/facstaff/dagrossa-p/articles/LifeWithoutChiefs.pdf) which claims that hunter-gatherer societies choose leaders (called headmen) based on their (the headmens') ability to provide resources to the group. It also claims that most of these societies are egalitarian, in the sense that food is distributed perfectly equally. This seems contradictory to me. If I get my fair share of food whether I support the headman or not, what is my motivation to support him and work hard? Shouldn't it make sense for me to take it easy, reduce risk to my health, and use my time for other pursuits (such as mating efforts) rather than working hard for social status? What is my motivation to hunt or gather to the best of my ability if it will not improve my status within the group? should I *care* about status  if resources are distributed equally?


The first answer that comes to my mind is that men of higher status find it easier to take more wives than slackers and freeloaders. But why should females even want to marry men of higher status, if preference is not given to kin regarding distribution of food?

I'm writing a reflection paper on this article, and I'm having trouble believing that the two aforementioned premises - that leadership is determined by production ability and that food is distributed equally among a village or tribe - can coexist. 

I'm not looking for you to write my paper for me. Not at all. I'm just looking for help to understand how (and, for that matter, if) societies can or should be structured in the manner described.

1316252468.0	kik25	Pregnancy in history - what were the attitudes? 	misscastaway	31	0	22	"What gave rise to this post was that I heard an old lady talk in a bus about how she thought to-be-mothers today were shameless showing of their big bellies. She seemed to be of an opinion that pregnant women should stay home and try hide their bellies rather than let them show. I remember also encountering this type of attitudes in a few novels written around 19th century although it was never made into a big deal in the story.

The vague impression I've gotten is that among upper middle class and upwards pregnancy has at times(?) been viewed as something embarrassing - maybe equivalent to how teenagers feel about menstruation today? Nothing that anyone sees as something bad per se but still something you shouldn't talk openly about or show off. But, that's just my wild speculation and I would really appreciate if someone has more knowledge of the matter or where I could find adequate information (good journals or books).

EDIT: Note that I am talking about pregnancies within marriage and thus something that of course was expected and wanted.
EDIT2: For clarity. When I say expected and wanted I am not talking about the feelings of parents but the expectations of society due to practicalities. A man needed to have a son to pass on his property to and in that sense it was recognized as necessary to get married and have kids to obtain that. "	t5_2qkdk	True

People often like to joke about Reddit's ""made up"" points but of course as anthropologists we know that all social status markers are cultural constructions. Even money only has the value we assign it. But at least Reddit's karma points are based upon some perceived value of a comment or submission. Team periwinkle &amp; team orangered are totally arbitrary divisions. And right now everything is fun and games with both sides equally able to ""win"" - unlike, say, in Jane Elliot's famous [blue eye/brown eye experiment](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/divided/). But it got me thinking about the power of [totems](https://autocww2.colorado.edu/~toldy3/E64ContentFiles/AnthropologyAndCultures/Totemism.html), social status markers, and belonging. So I had two questions for you /r/anthropology:

1) From an anthropological perspective, what interesting phenomenon have you observed on Reddit today with regards to new positioning with status markers (hats) and teams?

2) What is your favorite modern example of such phenomenon? Any ethnographies to recommend? Most of the classics are about sports teams &amp; tribal communities. Any new and good stuff out there?"	t5_2qkdk	True
