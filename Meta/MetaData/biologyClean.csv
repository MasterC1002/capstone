1363791553.0	1anyor	My lab's R01 grant just got cut by $60k (~20%) for the year. Anyone else feel like mailing a box of poop to their congressperson?	nastyasty	503	110	308	"We were already stretched pretty thin as it was. We have an NIH R01 and a small internal grant to cover my PI, one grad student (me), and two post-docs (one senior). There's also another grad student whose stipend is covered by a training grant, but depends on the R01 for reagents and equipment time. Typically R01s are meant to cover a PI and two grad students/post-docs, plus reagents for about 2 projects.

So, thanks to the sequester, we were just notified that this upcoming fiscal year (i.e. as of April) we are getting $220k instead of $280k. The kicker is that we had already started digging into next year's money because we're stretched so thin. This is also the final year of the R01 and our chances of renewal are pretty slim despite being a fairly prominent and reputable lab in our field.

I guess this is the way funding will be in the USA for the foreseeable future. Labs will have to make do with whatever they can scrounge up. We are planning to submit as many grant applications to as many sources as we can, even if it's just a predoctoral fellowship to cover my stipend, or just a small technical grant. We'll take what we can get.  My PI is actually considering crowdfunding our research.

Of course, not only does having less money for the year mean that our research will most definitely take a hit, but the fact that we now need to spend even more time writing grants just worsens that. With all our research potential spent on saving and chasing money, this means we'll have less output (fewer publications), and therefore a worse chance of getting the grants we're spending all our time writing. It's a negative feedback loop. We also have less time and money to travel to meetings and conferences, therefore reducing our lab's exposure and my ability to look for potential post-docs.


tl;dr: Thanks, Obama. (Edit: IT'S A JOKE, PEOPLE)

Edit on 3/21: Kansas Senator Jerry Moran (R) today proposed a $1.5bn increase in the NIH budget as an amendment to the ongoing budget proposal. This has a good chance of passing as long as you contact your Senate representatives and tell them about it!

He let out a deep sigh and spoke, mumbling amidst tears
“oh to hold her so tightly, our bonds steadfast and strong..  now I can only dream of.. dream.. of.. oh the pity.. oh..” he drooped forward, staring intently at the ground. Emotions heightened, acidic nightmares encompassed his mind, haunting him as helicase was summoned once more. A final farewell was shared amongst his indirect neighbours, Guanine and Guanine.
“Tell the others.. I will never forget” Thymine whispered. Guanine and Guanine nodded in unison, knowing looks crossed between them as the huge mass of helicase slowly approached, bearing its bond destroying regions so clearly.

Whipped up into the air, Thymine didn’t have time to register the long chain of similarly unfortunate souls cast out in front of him. His thoughts were back with Adenine. Reminiscing her beautiful heterocyclic nitrogens, he was in a flurry of self-denial. The strand he occupied grew longer and longer, hosting what could only be described as a circular structure. ‘She deserved to lead” he told himself for the hundredth time, ‘she really did’ but with every reiteration Thymine was losing hope. A sceptical attitude emerged as he was siphoned through the motions, his backbone being broken and remoulded to fit into his new niche. Finally his lagging came to a standstill and he observed in horror as cytokinesis ripped through the distant cytoplasm, the actin-myosin ring contracting until only a nanometre of his previous home remained connected. Memories flashed before him, followed by the final severing. This was the end.

A new bond, a new life. Thymine’s new partner was nothing like his beloved Adenine, though this Adenine shared a few of her qualities. The superficial resemblance was uncanny to say the least, but inside he found nothing to satisfy his cravings for his Adenine held so dear. Cytosine and Guanine on his right and left respectively were cheery enough, however, none shared his continual yearning for the past. Thymine lived miserably for days, yielding eventually to a cunning, destructive plan to set his life back to how he believed it should be.

1350769480.0	11td7j	Want to go to grad school someday?  Stop worrying about your GPA and major and start working in a lab	neurotrophic	223	42	110	"I see a lot of undergrads here asking if their GPA is good enough, if they have the right major, if they should take this class or that class, if their GRE scores are high enough, etc etc.

IT DOESN'T MATTER.  I don't care if you have a 2.8 or a 3.8 (REALLY), if you major in Biothis or Biothat or if you decided to take an art class one semester instead of a science elective as long as you spent every waking moment you possibly could in a lab.  The only thing I regret about my undergrad experience, where I got fine grades but nothing amazing and juggled art classes with science, is that I only started working in labs my 3rd year.

If you're in undergrad, get in there now.  Yes, do your best in your classes too, and talk to your advisors about what classes you should be taking, but after you get the grade STOP WORRYING ABOUT IT.  Focus on your research and try to do the best you can, learn as many techniques as you can, and read scientific papers.

The single most important thing you can do for your career as a scientist is to get undergrad experience in a lab.  Yes, there are people who get into grad school who didn't have lab experience before but were able to ride in on good reccs, high GRE scores, and a 3.9, but THEY are the exceptions, NOT the person with 3+ years of lab experience and a 3.2.

Oh, and if you ever find yourself asking ""should I apply for X?"" the answer is ""YES, while you run a gel"""	t5_2qhn7	True

Restriction digest today revealed it was not the pMAR plasmid. but some other random plasmid from some unknown contamination source. We don't even use any other Kana resistance strains..grrrr. 

TL;DR My bacteria trolled me by refusing to take up the plasmid I wanted it to, and insulted me by taking up a different random one.

Oh God of Agarose,

Hallowed be thy Gel.

When PCR is done,

Thy wells will become,

Loaded, with orange and blue.

Give us this day our separate bands,

And forgive us our crappy visualisations.

As we forgive those who pinch the stain box.

Lead us not into the dark room,

But deliver us from supervisors

For thine is the DNA, the hyperladder and the buffer.


For now, and until 5pm.

Amen.

TwistedBlister	138	36	60	I was reading about the coloration of animals for camouflage- and it seems that animals usually have adapted to using shades of brown, grey, black, and even white. But amphibians and reptiles have adapted the ability to use green colors, even in the exact same settings and areas that mammals have adapted to using a different range of colors. And some varieties of birds and sea life use every color in the spectrum to hide or hunt.... so why haven't mammals? I can think of a few that would have better camouflage if they were able to produce shades of green.	t5_2qhn7	True

I am brand new to this subreddit, i am here because not 20 minutes ago i just witnessed one of the most beautiful things i have ever seen.  I was relaxing out in my yard when i looked down in the grass to see a small beetle no bigger than the tip of a pen.  I got down eye level with it just to see its point of view and as i stared on at its beauty it reared up on its back legs spread its wings, which were easily 4 times wider than its body. Just for a second it just stood there, wings catching the light spring breeze as they glisten off the suns rays. And then it took flight and out into the vast jungle of grass which is my yard.  Then i realized what i have always wanted to be, and that is a wildlife biologist.  I would like to learn as much as i can about the bugs and animals that i inhabit this planet with.  I am at a crucial point in life where i need to decide what i will be doing with my life and i think i just found it.	t5_2qhn7	True

It has 2000x oil immersion zoom at max (although I'll rarely use it at that capacity), comes with a microscope camera, some prepared slides (which are quite awesome), and a carry case.

Apart from some simple experiments I shall be performing (basic things like pond water viewing, finding chromosomes that are splitting, chopping bugs in half and looking at their guts...) I would like to perform many more. 

So I come here asking, what are you favorite microscope based experiments, and what ones do you recommend I do at home?

1334358183.0	s8pg9	I have studied the Carpenter bee for about 5 years and have some interesting information regarding how they perceive visual information and store that abstract information in their memory.	justmadethisaccountt	115	13	9	"For whatever reason, Carpenter bees love to drill holes and plant their nests in the awning of my house. On the upper door frame of my back entrance I've studied them over the years as I go into my backyard. They drill every year at the same time, in the same places of the house. You can hear them digging/drilling at night, and see them bring food stores into the nest during the day. None of this is interesting, let me get to the good part.

Whenever I open my door and they are about to approach the nest entrance, they get completely confused. If you don't know about the behavior of Carpenter bees, they are non-aggressive and don't seem to care about humans the same manner a city pigeon would. The problem is, when they approach the entrance, they can't track the location of the nest with the door open. The location of their nest, with a solid white painted door seems like an imprinted image into their brains. Their flight pattern immediately hones backward to a predefined position that the bee brain knows was correct. As I slowly close the door and stop it in a certain position, the angle changes, and the bee finds a closer orientation based on that angle. Whenever the door position changes, the bee will quickly go back to the closest honing orientation. However, even if you keep the door fully open, the bee will eventually find the entrance. Interestingly, if you close the door halfway, the bee can find the entrance 5x faster. With these observed behaviors, I believe the bee is using some type of algorithm that finds a best guess, continues to a new orientation, then compares that information with stored memory, and will continue or back up and try again. These behavior patterns indicate to me the bee has a way to track a composite amount of navigational data, combined with some type of visual data. These two types of information are merged, except the navigational data obviously has a bigger mathematical weight.

This information could be useful to someone, potentially extremely useful in AI development, but I put it here first because maybe this information is already known in your field.

Just a thought. 

Update: Looks like we have a fair number of people who can answer general questions. Can some inquisitive youths please post their questions/common concerns here so they can be addressed? Also veterans if you would like to bring up some of the more common questions you've heard it would be appreciated. 

Questions to answer so far (feel free to ask me to add/edit them, sorta going from memory on recent posts I've seen):

1) I am interested in (area of biology). Do I need a masters or a PhD? What sorts of jobs are available if I have or don't have those advanced degrees?

2) How do I go about choosing and applying to a graduate program that is right for me?

3) Should I take time off before graduate school to work or do an internship?

4)What degree/program did you go through and what are you doing now? How does one go about getting [ideal position] in [your field]. What do you do in your daily job?

**To those who have volunteered to answer questions**:
Please see above. I will add more questions as they come up, but it would be good if you could address these in a defined framework. Please start by stating your area/current job. I will compile these as they come up. Thanks everyone!"	t5_2qhn7	True

Thank you again for your many wonderful sentiments, gifts and love that you all conveyed during my retirement ceremony. If it didn’t show, I was truly swollen with pride.   It is absolutely proven time and again that ----- is truly a family and that love permeates every facet of that association.

 Just some thoughts:  Most people see the electron microscope as just a huge piece of scientific equipment.  It is not, it is a place. It has taken me into the essence of life itself. I have crossed cell membranes with more ease that sodium ions, I have followed an axon for miles, I have observed actin and myosin locked in each other’s embrace, I have lived in the company of thousands of mitochondria and found no two exactly alike, I have watched cilia wave in rhythm like fields of wheat, I have seen cells being born and die, I have seen pathologies develop and heal.  Colleagues have told me that this technology is now no longer cost effective and that it is becoming obsolete. Maybe it is the manufacturer’s fault. Maybe it is the government’s fault . Maybe service contracts costs are the fault.  Maybe it is my fault because I did not take the time to show everyone all the things I have seen and all the places the scope has taken me.  Yes it is my fault. I have been privileged to stroll where few have been. For all of you who have made that journey possible at ---, I send my gratitude and my apologies.
To paraphrase General MacArthur’s retiring comment concerning old soldiers:  “ Old microscopists never die, they just go out of focus”.
In appreciation and farewell,

1375660261.0	1jphvt	Some rubrics for success with undergraduate research		100	18	24	"I spent this summer supervising probably my umpteenth undergrad researcher and I had to sit back and watch as he often made so many classic and easily avoidable mistakes.  I tried to warn him about things, but alas I could not predict everything.   Basically, all the problems boil down to the same thing: doing research, regardless of the academic setting, is not like school.  Sure, in some ways all research is like school, but it some important ways it is the opposite, thus applying your student skills to your research can have either unsatisfactory or even disastrous results.

There are three main rules you need to live by as an undergraduate researcher:

**(1) Be there for the lab, don't expect the lab to be there for you until you have proven yourself.**  In class, the professors are there for you, in lab you are there for the lab.  Never forget this.   Regardless of the teaching mission of your school, although the professors are 100% obligated to take you into their classes and teach you there, they are 0% obligated to take *you* into their lab.  There are always other students, keep that in mind.  Everything you do in that lab is a small bit of payback for the time and energy people are putting in to teach you and work around you.  Don't kid yourself about this, you need to prove your worth, not the other way around.

**(2) It's not about grades anymore.** Doing well in school is all about finding the path of least resistance to the best possible grade, in research there are no grades and the path of least resistance almost always passes through cutting necessary corners. Don't do this.  And don't waste time looking for the ""right"" answer, the whole point of research is that we don't know it -- this is not your cookbook lab exercise from Chem 102.  Ask plenty of questions along the way, no matter how harried or irascible we seem, we would much rather deal with something when it is small and brought to our attention than when it is big and buried in the incomprehensible results you have dumped on us. In classes, there is only a finite amount of return you can get for an investment of time and effort -- once you have worked hard enough to get an A, the rest of the time is free. *Research is the opposite, the more you put into it, the more you get out of it.* Show that you know this and not only will you get *much* more out of the experience, you will get a great recommendation that puts you among the best students.

**(3) Be professional.** In classes you are only responsible for yourself: if you don't show up, show up late, or don't do the work, etc. no one suffers but you.  All these behaviors, however, will negatively impact the lab, your work, and your reputation.  I had a very promising undergrad torpedo his whole internship by showing up 15 minutes late (and loudly) to the only two lab meetings during the internship (they were 9:30 in the morning). The very famous and very busy PI of that lab never saw the student except for lab meetings, and all the PI saw of this guy was that he was lazy and unreliable -- that student could kiss his golden recommendation good-bye.  If you miss deadlines or do shoddy work, those who depend on that work will suffer, and they will not look kindly on you in return. And don't get defensive if someone cares enough to call you on any of this unprofessional behavior, believe it or not we all have car trouble/cell phone trouble/other obligations/real lives outside the lab and still manage to show up and be on time and when we can't we know how not to leave people in the lurch and make up what we missed. Be aware that all research jobs are a link in a chain, you may just be washing bottles now, but if you do that well you will to fill those bottles, then use what is in them, eventually you can have your own research which you are in charge of, but you have to show you can do even seemingly menial tasks well.  And for the love of Pete, finish your project before you leave the lab [EDIT: or bring it to a good stopping point where someone else can pick it up easily]. The chance of any of your work going anywhere or meaning anything to anyone if you just drop it and leave is probably about 0.1%.

I know this may seem harsh, but it just breaks my heart to see so many bright students shooting themselves in the foot, squandering their chances for good research, or wasting the time of good grad students and postdocs who have their own careers to look after.  Good luck to you all!

1375608911.0	1jo9qu	I graduated 3 months ago with a B.S in Molecular Biology. I now work as a Lab Technician at a Biotech company making 20/hr. Where do I go from here future-wise?	HenryHill11	116	31	82	"After 5 years of college I now make 40K a year at a Biotech start up (3-4 year old company). What possibilities are there for me in the future? I know I could stick with this job for a couple years and try to move up - but everyone who works in R&amp;D has MINIMUM a Masters (rare) - 95% are Vets in the Industry with Ph.D's.

After gaining experience, what career options would be best to pursue? I can't live my whole life off of 40k a year..

One thing I was looking at was becoming a Clinical Laboratory Scientist(CLS). This would require roughly another year of pre-req schooling and 1 year of classes/internship at a Biotech (if accepted into the program, that is!).


Anyone else in this same situation or have any advice on how to advance in this field? Possible Medical or clinical Cert's to look into that pay a lot better ?

I love science, I love what I do and masochistically enough I want nothing but to stay in science. But my PhD is going straight to hell because I don't get the support most other PhD students get and I don't even get a project to work on.

When I started, my PI (physisit doing mostly computational biology) and another PI (biochemist/molecular biologist) had a living collaboration going on and I was to take on a project they had together. It was a really cool subject and I was enthusiastic on working on it. Everything looked really good on paper. 

However, after about one year I realized that I wasn't getting much if any supervision at all (2-3 meetings a year with no post doc or other student to turn to for help). During this year one of the PIs got another position and changed her field pretty much completely. My PI on the other hand grew tired of the project because the results were not coming in fast enough mostly due to limited access to a mass spectrometer. And I was asked to move on to another project. Sure. That was fine for me and I started on a project of a PhD student in the group who was about to defend his thesis.

All good, I thought. Now I had a method that was working, there was a clear theme and all. But after half a year it became obvious that I would not be allowed to carry on with this topic because it was actually reserved for a PhD student from another group to finish (a collaboration project). This was something I had no idea of. So one and a half year in, I'm again forced to change subject.

I came up with some ideas of my own which I'm now following. But I get essentially no supervision. All help that I do get comes from random professors or post docs I manage to make to look my data/experimental design. So everything goes very slowly and I am forced to learn by trail and error. There is no one I can talk to where I wouldn't need to start by introducing them to the topic and explaining why I do what I do.

Meanwhile, all random side projects are dumped on me. Check the expression for protein A for group Z. Run western blots for group Y:s project. These projects have essentially nothing in common and while I will graduate with about  2 third/fourth author papers and 2 first names the thesis itself will be a mismatch about 4 entirely different projects. It sucks and this is not how I wanted to do science. I'm essentially a machine for western blot - an easy method ANYONE could do. Again, I'm left pretty much alone because the collaborators only want the results - they are not interested in discussing them with me. My supervisor? He knows just about what an antibody is.

The worst part: I'm afraid I won't stand a chance in finding a post doc position in a decent to good group. How could I possibly convince them to take me when I have no Nature/Science/Cell papers (I guess the best I can do is something along the lines of JMB) and/or no expertise in any relevant method. I know I'm smart and capable but I'm afraid I won't be able to show it when sending in an application.

So far I'm trying to network the best I can as well as learn new skills that I can do by myself without any access to expensive equipment (try assays that require only the simple pipette-centrifuge-thermoblock set up) and programming. But I seriously doubt it will make a big difference.

I have frequently talked to my supervisor but he does his best to avoid the subject and if he agrees to talk about it he tells me that ""that's life."" and ""it's not hard to find a post doc."" etc. I get the feeling though that he does not want to deal with it. He doesn't seem to want me to work in another group either and because of that the dean of the department wasn't positive about my plans to apply for transfer. Despite which, I think it might be too late now anyway.

Any personal experience, advice or suggestions are more than welcome!

EDIT: I forgot to add, that after the collaboration with the biochemist and after having a post doc who refused to share his research with anyone (even the PI) he decided to quit the lab. The other graduate student who had been there slightly longer than me quit and I think she went on to marketing or something. So now I'm the only one left which is why my PI is totally unmotivated when it comes to anything that has to do with lab."	t5_2qhn7	True

1294237859.0	ewlsf	My daughter (voluntarily?) stops her heart from beating	galtzo	90	6	105	"First I should say, I am NOT seeking medical advice or sympathy, just anecdotes, and experiences. I want to know, is my child unique, and what can I do to better understand her condition, and help the medical community understand this phenomena?

My daughter is now 2 years, 3 months old.  She has a congenital heart disease called [Tetralogy of Fallot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy_of_Fallot) (TOF).  Her case is more severe than an average case, and she needed a corrective open heart surgery at 5 months, and again at 13 months.  ~~Throughout those first 13 months of her life~~ During the time between those surgeries, she would pass out when she got really angry.  Her eyes would roll back in her head and she would just slump over.  We did not realize that she was actually stopping her heart.  However, looking back now [this comment from the nurse](http://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/ewlsf/my_daughter_voluntarily_stops_her_heart_from/c1bnj8n) immediately after the first surgery may be significant.  Thanks to my wife for [fixing my memory](http://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/ewlsf/my_daughter_voluntarily_stops_her_heart_from/c1bnctm)!

After her second corrective surgery her heart was functioning well.  But she was very upset about the conditions of being in the hospital, and at one point got very upset, was screaming, and then her eyes rolled back and she passed out, the same way she always did at home.  Except this time she was hooked up to lots of monitoring equipment, and the heart rate monitor flatlined a long beep, that seemed to go on forever.  In reality it was only 18 seconds.  She was revived with frantic stimulation.

The doctors puzzled over what had happened.  Over the course of the next few days in recovery from this second corrective surgery this scene played out several times, where she would flatline for anywhere from 10 to 20 seconds.  The doctors did tests but could not understand how she was stopping her heart when she got angry.  She wasn't stopping breathing first.  She goes from crying and screaming, straight to eyes rolling back and slumping over.

They had no known conditions they could point to and say, ""we've seen this before, and it is caused by x, y, and z"".  They basically told us, ""We don't have a name for it, we don't know how it happens, but we'd like to put in a pacemaker.""

So while still in recovery from the second open heart surgery, she went into a third surgery to implant a pacemaker.

The pacemaker is wonderful, in that it constantly monitors her heart, and we know how often it is used, (i.e. how often her heart rate drops too low).  It is being used.  She still gets angry the same way she did in the past (she's also a red head!) but she has not passed out/slumped over, since she's had the pacemaker.  It has kept her from 'dying' again.

**DAE** think that sequencing her genes would be beneficial? (see [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/ewlsf/my_daughter_voluntarily_stops_her_heart_from/c1bq1wi))

**DAE** think that a brain scan during one of her episodes would help?

**DAE** know of similar stories?  I'd like to think there are a group of people with similar conditions, and that is can be studied, or even better that it IS being studied.


**TL;DR**: My Daughter has TOF, and her heart stops when she gets angry.  She now has a pacemaker.  Know of anything similar? Doctor's had nothing on it.


**Edit**: The doctors also do NOT think the TOF is related to the stopping of the heart.  There is no known previous correlation to the stopping of the heart, and TOF is rather common.

**Edit2**: Interestingly, and perhaps I'm reading too much into this, it seems like she gets even madder when she is unable to ""shut down"".  Perhaps she gets angrier when she feels her heart being paced.  I'm sure it is a strange feeling.  It 'seems' like she is aware that she is no longer able to do this 'trick'.

[HeartConditions](http://www.reddit.com/r/heartconditions/comments/ex7ze/xpost_from_biology_my_tof_daughter_voluntarily/)

**Edit4**: The ECG has only been described to me as ""Good"" and ""Normal"".  Perhaps I should ply for more information about any abnormalities they might have seen and not told us about?

**Edit5**: I enjoy seeing science, medicine, and health improve, and I think doctors might be able to learn from this somehow. But I need to bring it to the attention of the right doctors. I've been directed to one so far in the comments below post, and more are, of course, welcome!

**Edit6**: One still birth, and 7 miscarriages between her maternal and paternal grandmothers out of 20 pregnancies, AFAIK.

**Edit7**: My wife [corrected me](http://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/ewlsf/my_daughter_voluntarily_stops_her_heart_from/c1bnctm) in that we only noticed the behavior *after* the first corrective surgery when she was 5 months old.

**Edit8: DAE** think it might be the [genetic disorder called catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, CPVT for short](http://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/ewlsf/my_daughter_voluntarily_stops_her_heart_from/c1bq1wi) and that an an exercise / stress EKG would be a good idea?

Hey, are you an alpha carbon, because you look susceptible to a backside attack!

Do you want to extract some protein from my column?

According to the second law of thermodynamics, you’re supposed to share your hotness with me. 

Everyone knows it’s not the size of the vector that matters, but the way the force is delivered.

How about me and you go back to my place and form a covalent bond?
If I was an endoplasmic recticulum, how would you want me: smooth or rough?

We can make a mess as I’ve hired some lysosomes to clean up after. 
My hypothalamus must be secreting serotonin because baby, I want you!

I wish I was an ion so I could form an exothermic bond with you.

You’re so cute you make my zygomaticus muscles contract.

I wish I were adenine because then I could get paired with U.
You’re like telophase, I admire your cleavage.

Hey baby, want to form a synapse with me and exchange neurotransmitters?

Hey baby, want to form a zygote?

It’s a good thing you’ve got evaporative cooling, cause I’m going to make you sweat!

If I were a Schwann cell, I’d squeeze around your axon and give you a fast action potential. 

Want to be my substrate/enzyme?

If my right leg is the cell wall and my left the membrane, do you want to be the cytoplasm?

If you were a concentration gradient I’d go down on you.

If you were C6 and I were H12, all we would need is the air we breathe to be sweeter than sugar. 

Whenever I am near you, I undergo anaerobic respiration because you take my breath away!

I want to stick to you like glue-cose.

You must be the one for me, since my selectively permeable membrane let you through.

Can I be your enzyme because my active site is dying for a chemical reaction!

You give me more jolt than a mitochondria!

Right now we’re just two RNA, but maybe we could transcribe together and become DNA.

I have a smooth endoplasmic reticulum but know that I like it rough, if you know what I mean…

I also prefer my ribosomes bound…..tight.

Spin me round with your basal body and make sure it’s turgid!
Do you like aerobic respiration as much as I do?

You're like an electron and I'm like a proton, we were made to be attracted to each other!

I've recently started a PhD program in cell and molecular biology and I am curious how people who don't want to be professors end up. This also might be good for all of those undergrads thinking of pursuing a PhD but don't want to teach. 

Update: Thanks for everyone who is contributing. I'm not looking for specific advice at the moment, I was just hoping to see what sorts of things people did and if it was really just selling their scientific soul. I can see how it would be a much preferable situation to go into if I (when I graduate) have a family and whatnot due to the easier hours and better pay. As for what I will actually do, I suppose only time will tell. Thanks again and keep the comments coming!"	t5_2qhn7	True

1343665370.0	xeb0v	Grad school woes	Lulz4Cheezus	87	15	49	So my major professor has a history of treating his grad students like crap. To sum it up my defense got delayed at 10pm by my professor 24 hours in advance because he felt it was too rushed. He also implied by his emails that he never even read the first drafts of my thesis I sent him months ago but just signed off on everything. This guy refuses to make time to meet with his students and doesn't pay much attention to them, but I tried to be the good guy and not come across as disrespectful by demanding his attention. I went to the dean furious, showed him the emails, and my dean drew the same conclusion. He was furious and called my committee members to talk to them about this. My other two committee members called me the next day to tell me they didn't know why my professor had done this because they didn't have problems with my thesis and were planning on passing me. Now that it's impossible to get them into the same room until September I'm wicked delayed and it's making me HORRIBLY distraught and depressed. I've spent the last few years watching my friends have lives, get married, buy houses, start families, and I'm still stuck in college at 27. I am HORRIBLY depressed, angry, and feeling like I'm never going to escape this fresh hell. Is there anything I can do or have any of you had similar experiences? 	t5_2qhn7	True
