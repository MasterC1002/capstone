(Could write a novel about that separately)  We noticed there were a bunch of porta-pottys lined up on the sidewalk but couldn't figure out why, strange...   As we start walking back at about 2pm, we see traffic is jammed on the street going towards the hotel, and then we see the road is blocked by police and also happen to notice a twin rotor helicopter flying overhead which we figure is a news chopper. We walk farther down the street and see the cross-street which we have to turn right on is blocked with metal detectors and police.  At this point we see A LOT of people, filling the streets and holding flags and signs, but standing still, not much commotion.  A little concerning to see such a large group people, looking like a protest.  We proceed through the metal detectors and try to maneuver our way through people to go the 3 or 4 blocks we need to go to get to the hotel.  The whole crowd soon started walking together down the street.  We were a little confused what we were protesting about, not understanding any of the signs people were carrying.  A father and daughter overheard us speaking English and he turned around and asked jokingly with his Russian accent, ""Why are you guys here? You have nothing to do with this""  We told him we were just trying to get back to our hotel.  We chatted for a while and he explained what it was all about.  There were AT LEAST 10,000 people we estimated.

This is what happened in center of Moscow last night:
[video](http://t.co/HlPdZm1E)
What have started as a small opposition protest against fake elections grew up to 10'000 people marching to elections HQ with omon and police trying to stop them.  
Most of the opposition leaders were arrested and being held in courts.
Official news and tv keeping things silent, those, who report, lie about the scale of protests, they reduce the numbers of participants and distort the picture in general.  
Some sources report that military has been called to Moscow this morning to calm down the situation.  
Most people doesn't know what is going on, because there's now news feed  available, except twitter (#5dec #чп) and independent channel called TVRain.  
I haven't seen anything like this since 1991 or 1993, people are really pissed about what's going on.  
Spread the news guys, tell the world that Russia is at the point of change! Help us tell every single Russian of what is really happening in Moscow!  
Here's some links of what is going on:

1375453112.0	1jkcdz	Why russians care so much about WWII	GingerEly	56	13	79	"A scandal is raising about the game Company of Heroes 2 where the Soviet Army is portrayed as a monstrous horde of cowards and murderers. There is enough posts dedicated to it all over Reddit and in this exact subreddit as well. 

BadComedian did a good job explaining why the game is so insulting, but i feel that i could add a point to the whole perspective and help the non-Russian people understand why exactly WWII is hugely important to Russians.

WWII, or being more precise, the Great Patriotic war, is the centre of our national self-conscience. It is related to every man.

Winning that fight was an enourmous struggle. Every family contributed its members to the front, or to the over-time work for the front. Casualties were so huge that while studiyng wwII at school at my class there wasn't a single person whose grand-grand-parents avoided war. Most of us have a war casualty in their family history.

That means that when someone is insulting Soviet army he is spitting on the graves of our ancestors. It is not about balancing the 'historical truth' i am not going to deny that war crimes and propagandistic adjustments were made from all the sides of the conflict. It is about the memory and respect for the people of the past.

Great Patriotic war is as important as constitution to Americans, as Holocaust to the Jews, etc. "	t5_2qh75	True

I understand Russia is a big place and some places have it worse (or easier) than others. But from what ive read, the winters range from -85c to -20c. So its cold either way lol

So I had a Russian friend once, who lived here in the states. He use to tell me how amazed he was at how quickly the snow melted. He was fond of reminding us that ""When it snows in Russia... the Snow stays for many many months and never melts! This American snow is nothing!"". 

He always told us how adapted Russia was as handling the harsh winters. He would tell us how the winter never really stopped anyone. It never mattered how much snow, people still went out in their motorcycles! Really? Motorcycles all year around?

Not sure how many actual Russians visit this subreddit, but I would like to know what the Soviet Winters were like in your area. Give me as much detail (Location, amount of snow, temperature, longevity of snow, etc) as you are will to give. I would love to read your stories. 

Sincerely,
     An American who gets 6 inches of snow a year that melts quickly.

EDIT: Because of the relatively small size of this subreddit, I don't know quickly or how many folks will see this. So I encourage you to post no matter how old this post is. I want to hear from you in 1 week or 1 year!  "	t5_2qh75	True

1294122083.0	evuvt	Everyone is wrong about Khoderkovsky, because they are arguing about the wrong thing.	minnabruna	31	4	26	"I just read yet another article from the Russian perspective (found on this subreddit [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/ev15f/is_putin_pitiable_or_is_the_financial_times/)), attacking a Western news outlet for taking Khoderkovsky's statements at face value and trying to make Russia in general look unambiguously bad. 

I agree with a lot of what the author had to say, but with a very large caveat. My concerns over biased coverage apply to both sides of the debate, but for reasons unrelated to the case itself.  Khoderkovsky committed serious crimes. He is not in jail for those crimes, but if he were charged only with crimes he committed, he would still be in the middle of a heavy sentence. However.....

HE is not in jail because of those crimes (although he should be). He is in jail because of corruption. Corruption is a catastrophe for Russia. It is a major reason that people now want to go into government service instead of building and modernizing the economy in business, it it a major reason why so much money leaves the country as soon as it is earned instead of staying and being used to continue to build Russia, it is a major reason that foreigners are reluctant to invest and once the krisiz hit, so many pulled out (those that were willing to invest always saw it as a high risk adventure, never as a safe bet, and now re-attracting investment form Russians and foreigners to help get Russia out of the krisiz is very difficult), and it is a major reason why there is such unrest and discontent in Russia at the moment.

It is the corruption that makes his case important.  I am less worried about the injustice done to him - as I mentioned above, he committed real crimes and my sympathy to him is only as much as to any human in a tough situation of their own making.  I am worried about the precedence that his case set. Such a blatant political case, ignoring Russian law, sends a message to other people in power that it is OK to do the same in their own interests, I am less worried about Khoderkovsky than I am a businessman who is targeted for his assets, an honest political activist targeting corruption targeted to silence their voice and frighten their supporters, as well as for honest people seeking true justice for harm done to them, who cannot get it because they cannot pay for it.

Why, if Khoderkovsky truly deserves punishment for his crimes (and he does), could he not be tried for things that he actually did? In all likelihood he would be in jail for even longer than he will be now. He is not, because of corruption. Because people with whom he committed those crimes are still paying for their safety, are still in power enjoying the money they stole, and still hurting ordinary Russians by making a system so unfair they have no incentive to break out of a helpless mentality. Trying Khoderkovsky on such obviously illegal (according to Russian law) measures only supports such people even more.

At the same time, I am angry at Western writers who focus on Khoderkovsky as if he truly were a human right's martyr. This is not true, and when they focus on the wrong thing it hurt the case of people who want the best outcome for Russians, because it strengthens those who wish to support the case against him. It is not a case of the valiant Khoderkovsky standing up against the cruel, always-evil Russian Federation. When Westerners make it about that it makes it easy to avoid the real, difficult topic, that of corruption (complex stories less interesting to readers, hard to prove, ergo easy to be sued over, often too large an issue to cover in a few columns, sometimes requires incriminating their own powerful people). At the same time focusing on the wrong thing makes it easy for those in Russia guilty of weakening their own justice system to defend themselves. These men are also criminals, and when Westerners focus on the wrong thing, inaccurately and unfairly, it makes it easier for those in Russia hurting their own people to avoid criticism from those same people, and instead drum up their support from people such as the author.. If the Western critics are wrong and unfair, then their targets must be good guys? Right, Right? Of course. Now go home, live on a pittance and don't complain when they tell you to lie to Prime Minister Putin when he comes to see if the money sent to improve your hospital was really spent there or not. We have to stick together or ~~the terrorists~~ those nasty Western liars win.

I love Russia. I love (some) Russians. I want to see them live honestly, proudly, strongly. The argument over Khoderkovsky hurts this. It is flawed, on both sides, but proving Western journalists to be bad at their job does very little. At the most it may hurt individual journalists a little professionally, or even hurt their feelings. Allowing their bad writing to provide an excuse to overlook an issue that is really hurting your country makes Russians the biggest losers in this case. That is supremely unfair.

This is a small subreddit, and I am not sure how many people will read this (and how many of an even smaller group won't hate me for not fully and angrily supporting ""their"" side), but I do care what happens to Russia, a lot, and the more coverage I see the more upset I am. I therefore post my humble opinion in the hope of encouraging a little debate beyond Russia/Khoderkovksy is evil/an innocent victim.

A close second would be Kazan.  The whole east-meets-west thing  is so striking.  The Qolşärif Mosque and Orthodox cathedral are so close to each other it is astounding.  The city is multi-ethnic and the food is great.

I just got back from class and when I got on the Metro in Tretyakovskaya, a man got in too. I leaned against the end of a row of seats while this guy stood next to me. Through time, he came so close to me that his breath was on my face. At that point, I got really nervous that I didn't even pay attention to this constant pressing sensation on my butt thinking that it was just the seated person's shoulder. But anyhow, I moved away from this guy and got off at Shabalovskaya to get on the next carriage.

He followed me. And in that same way that he previously stood, he was right in my face. This time, I was just agitated. But when I felt the same sensation on my butt, I turned to see that his hand was groping my butt. I freaked out. I didn't know what to do because I was so afraid. I glared at him and moved towards the other end of the carriage.

He followed me and stood adjacent to me as I sat down. I was still shaking in fear. Suddenly, the seats next to me cleared up and he sat down next to me. By that time, I got up and sat next to a lady to ask for help. You see, my Russian is pretty bad and especially in my state of nervousness, I could only point at that guy, whispering to the lady ""Можете вы мне помочь? Он тронул меня. Много раз."" She stared at him for a while as he stood up to sit somewhere further. She told me to get off at the next stop - Kaluzhkaya. I told her that I was really afraid and she told me not to be.

When I got off at Kaluzhkaya, I stood by the escalator to call my boyfriend. Thankfully, he didn't follow me. But minutes later, I saw him going up the escalator. He waved and smiled at me.

In my mind right now, I wish I had done so many things to him to make him pay but my mind was blank at that moment. I felt so helpless."	t5_2qh75	True

Russia in my mind is such a 'classy' place, like Paris without the 'sleaziness' but much more romantic all, its enlightened, avantegarde, cultured, makes people think of elegant tsarist russian banquets, breezy strolls along the nevsky prospect, young lovers who recite poetry. All of this, but in a really sincere way, that isn't so aggressively bourgeois like America, or pretentious like Britain to my mind.
Russian is synonymous with vintage, romance, and human liberation.

But living in the West it seems theres awhole different image, poverty, overly macho alcoholics, and bad weather

This is one the elite universities at East Siberia. In my flow 6 groups with 20-30 people each, so around 180-200 people. And IMO university is sucks, there is total cheating around, and lecturers/teachers usually draw out even when people doesn't know shit! At the beginning I was excited about university life and always got A, but then I give up this total atmosphere of unfairness and just do as little as need to get the exams, because I am lazy person, but I am not stupid and I see a lot of really stupid students at university and a lot of not stupid but just who doesn't not shit about discipline and they almost all got, get diploma. Now I  passed 2 state exams and they completely sucks. First exam should start at 9 a.m. according schedule, but students always come to 7-30, at 8 they draw a question and then started freely and openly cheating, crib from internet, books and each over around 1 hour, then about 9 came lectures and then students starts passing exams and university workers and lectures know how they prepare just pretend they doesn't hear and see it. Even then many folks with all possible cheating could not pass exams on A or B, that is always ridiculous for me. So this is how it works, state exams on my universities. I don't know nothing about how it goes in US. 
Another issue that is always anger me is fact that many lecturers are late for exams, consultation etc., schedule has nothing respect at my university, often students wait teachers for hours till they appear.
Another issue that anger me a lot that students who didn't pass exams could pay money and repass exams, even state exams as many times and exams as they could afford. I know guys with 15 exams debts,who study and then somehow got diploma! 

So this is it. Many of this ""diploma students"" will get prestigious jobs, cos connections and lobbying value a lot in Russia. I have not connections so I have to made a way by myself now."	t5_2qh75	True

After seeing The Avengers this weekend, and getting to hear Scarlett Johansson stumbling through the beginning speaking 'Russian' as Natasha Romanoff, it struck me how many Western movies reference Russia, or have non-Russians in Russian roles.

Going back, I can remember off the top of my head - Iron Man 2, Transformers 3, X-Men: First Class, The Darkest Hour, Mission Impossible IV, and now The Avengers.

My Russian friends think it's a big joke - I remember going to a theater in Moscow for Transformers 3, and people were laughing at the way Russia was presented. 

However, they're also tired. For example, 'Natasha' used in a Western story has negative connotations in Russia because it is the stereotypical name that Westerners think of when they think of mail order brides, or more generally, the blonde Russian bombshell. Of course, the character was created in the 1960s at the height of the Cold War (which kind of justifies using a name like Natasha for an attractive Russian woman), but I don't think many Western movie makers today have an understanding of Russia before using it in their movies. I don't think filmmakers have any ill-will when they use stereotypes of Russia, but to me, it's hardly a justification.

How do redditors here feel about Russia's recent appearances in Western cinema, and non-Russians acting/speaking as Russians? Is it just a joke to laugh at, or are you actually annoyed/angered by it? Also, what Western movies do you know of that most accurately present Russia as it is?"	t5_2qh75	True

My mother in law was a member of the communist party. Her father was a patriotic Soviet citizen and still longs for the U.S.S.R. 

In my discussions with my mother in law, she has brought up many reasons why the Soviet Union was an excellent place to live. Naturally, being born and raised in the United States, it has been difficult for me to believe her based on what I have been taught about Soviet life. However, in my studies on the topic, I can see how there were plusses and minuses of Soviet life.

Among the best parts of the Soviet system that I can see is: guaranteed employment, free housing, free education, free healthcare, very low crime rate, sense of solidarity and pride among citizens.

Among the worst parts of the Soviet system I can see:
Priviledged class of politicians and beurocrats, mediocre housing (houses in the country without utilities, communal flats, Xruschovki), Mediocre health care (red tape, lack of supplies, corrupt doctors), very long forced working hours and later on Saturday work in the fields etc, lack of variety of foods in stores, long-lines to purchase staple goods, bad quality consumer electronics and consumer goods such as razors, TV's, Cars, etc. 

It seems to me that a very good point of Soviet life was the fact that everyone, for the most part, had a similar standard of living that was virtually guaranteed whether you were uborshik or a plant manager. You had security knowing that your family would be taken care of, there would be no booms and busts in the economy and long-term unemployment. You could expect to maintain a standard of living that was not rich, but certainly not very poor by industrialized standards. 

So, for those of you who have lived in both the Soviet Union and the United States, can you tell me honestly which system was better? Can you give me reasons why based on your own personal experience?

You may answer in Russian or in English as I speak both languages.

Edit: I am talking about the Soviet Union after the 1960's. Of course I am not talking about Stalinist times. I am referring to the period roughly from 1965 - 1985, so before perestroika."	t5_2qh75	True

I've always liked the idea, but never pushed for it because the main thing I use Reddit for -- finding interesting news stories -- was perfectly served in Russian by Newsland.ru.   However, any of you who use that site will have heard it's having its ""problems"" ie [censorship and fake voting scores](http://forum-msk.org/material/politic/7358724.html).  Runet is a cynical place, and as much as like the idea of a completely independent Ruddit, I think trust and transparency will be essential for people to bother taking part.  On that basis, I think there is no better place to do this than Reddit itself, and it's entirely feasible for these reasons:

* Reddit has a full [Russian interface](http://ru.reddit.com/) already live
* There is already a [/ru](http://www.reddit.com/r/ru/) subreddit, admittedly quiet right now
* Most websites fail because they have no user base, Reddit has a solid existing user base of Russian users
* Reddit is fast to load and has good uptime
* Reddit has a trustworthy vote system, and all mods can see what other mods delete, which makes censorship unlikely
* Reddit.ru is already a mirror domain for Reddit.com, I'm sure if there was an active /ru community they would allow us redirect reddit.ru to ru.reddit.com/r/ru

Anyone who wants to be a mod on /ru just say so.  I've already added the /russia mods and a few of the people who were discussing this, and personally I see no problem in people experimenting with the style sheets etc, the only thing I care about is that no spam makes it through.

1375735697.0	1jrjg4	Russian politeness or genuine interest?	unimagineablesunshin	24	5	24	"So I recently met a Russian guy from around Moscow (I'm Canadian). We went to a movie and then out for drinks as just a friendly thing. I was floored by how polite he was: opening doors for me, always letting me walk ahead when we went to sit anywhere, paid for absolutely everything, etc. He leaned in a lot talking to me and kept steady, intense eye contact most of the night when we were talking, invited me to hang out with him in a few days and repeated a few times what a great time he was having. So here's the thing; is he interested in something more than just friends, or is he just being extremely polite?

I haven't had much experience with Russian guys, but I do know that they are usually very chivalrous in general. I mean obviously here in Canada...if you're just going to hang out with a guy for the first time he usually won't pay for things unless he's trying to impress you (otherwise we pay our own way), and the door thing is just an extra politeness that they do now and then. So how can I tell if he's just being very nice in a friendly way or wants something more? "	t5_2qh75	True

1. Is the school system good in Russia? Does it differ from the east to the west of Russia? (By ""Good"" I mean, are the teachers great, average, bad, are the standards high for learning and grades, is there bullying problems)

2. Do Russians accept people who don't drink alcohol and don't smoke in social situations?

3. Are the people of the Sahka Republic (Yakutia) different from Russians? For instance, are they Christians? 

4. Are the police corrupt? If so, would someone that comes from a country where the police are not corrupt, don't take bribes, never take a blind eye, ect, be overwhelmed?

5. Is there campaigns in Russia against bullying in schools, pollution, and corruption? 

6. Does Russia's youth have different views on sexuality, being racist, and the government then the past generation?

I just spent 2.5 weeks in Russia over the winter holiday, going from Blagoveshchensk to Vladivostok... not heavily touristed places, especially in winter, so yeah I only saw other travellers once. I usually hung out with English-speaking locals I found via Couchsurfing, but on a few occasions of course I got myself surrounded by curious monolingual Russians who would ask me tons of questions. I could hold my own in a basic Russian conversation (key word: basic), but more often than not I was super lost and they would keep talking to me in monosyllables. On two separate occasions, I was asked about weed; first time (some apprentice railroad workers) went like ""oh, Kanada? da? hockey? marijuana? hahaha"" and the second time (in a small ghetto cafe on the outskirts of Khabarovsk) the guy actually asked me if I had any.

I've paid at least 7000 rub worth of drinks, cab rides and dinners for her during the past week. But then one night I got extremely drunk and she had to take care of me and pay for our cab ride back to my place (where she lived the entire week).

Some days later she asked me to pay her back. I was shocked. Why did she ask me this? It wasn't a lot of money, I couldn't care less about that. I just don't understand why she would ask for it back after how much I've paid for her. And she asked for all of it back, not just 50% (we both took the cab).

Obviously, I just gave her the money. As said, it wasn't a lot. But isn't it completely strange and socially awkward that she would ask me this? How could it be? Is it like a principle in Russia that the guy always has to pay, no exceptions? Is what she did not outrageous according to Russian culture? Do you reckon she just doesn't get a whole lot of allowance and struggles finanially? (as mentioned, her family is rich - visited her apartment and it was awesome)."	t5_2qh75	True

Huntington defines Russia as the core state of an orthodox civilization.

If one day, shit really hits the fan, who would the Russians prefer to ally themselves with?

The top speed of 2,400 km/h, a 3,600 kilometer range, an 18 kilometer ceiling, and an advanced radar system to detect large targets from as far as 400 kilometers.


This 4++ generation aircraft uses fifth-generation technology, and its advanced avionics, new engines, and remarkable weapons array mounted on 12 external hardpoints outperform any existing fourth-generation fighter.


The characteristics, the Su-35 surpasses practically all modern fighter jets such as France’s Rafale, Sweden’s Gripen, the Eurofighter 2000, and the modernized US F-15, F-16, and F-18.


The Russian Air Force currently has 10 Su-35s, to be increased to 48 by the end of 2015.

First of all, some background: I'm an American student currently studying abroad for a semester in St. Petersburg. Part of my course involves writing journal entries in response to various prompts, and most of them presume that I have Russian friends I can interview about stuff. I really don't, so I thought I would try Reddit. I have a lot of specific questions on two general topics: history and minorities. Any information is helpful; if you're not Russian by birth but you've lived in the country long enough to have some insight, by all means, contribute! But do, please, tell me where you were born and how long you've been in Russia.

**HISTORY**

1. How do Russians feel about their history and about their monarchist and communist past?

2. There are monuments all over St Petersburg and Moscow. How connected is the average Russian with the history of his/her country? 

3. How does the prevalence of historical monuments affect the way that Russians think about their present and future?

4. How has Russian geography helped determine Russian history – in terms of Russia's neighbors, its weather, soil, wars, etc?

------------------

**MINORITIES**

1. How do Russians feel about foreigners and minorities in their country?

2. To what degree do the following influence the Russians' opinion of minorities?:

&gt; * the minority's grasp of Russian culture

&gt; * the minority's fluency in the Russian language

&gt; * what profession the minority holds in Russia

3. Explain to me the Russian concepts of наши and чужой. Do these ideas make Russians culturally predisposed to xenophobia? Why?

4. Are there historical arguments to explain the current status of minorities in Russia?

5. Finally, between Russia and America (if you've been or lived here), what is the most challenging difference to adjust to? What's the easiest? 

I'm really excited about moving to St. Petersburg. I hear it's gorgeous, historic, and lively. Scared about the cold, but really looking forward to the summers. Any questions you guys could answer would help with my next big move. I just want to embrace the culture as best I can! Thanks!

We talked about the secret pact of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, Soviet occupation of Poland and the Baltics, deportations/purges in the Baltics, and the rape of Germany. They contended that none of these actually happened, and that they were in fact made up by the U.S. and other Western governments to weaken Russia's geopolitical position.

I'm a Russian major, and have been exposed to the Russian language for a while now, but my main knowledge came from my Russian language classes that I started last year. This recent summer I also went on a study abroad to Russia, and spent five weeks there. Our teacher was usually with us when we had to exchange money, or had to help us take care of things we didn't know how to do on our own. I went shopping and things on my own however. 

That being said, I didn't really get a full grasp of Russian life, and seeing as how no one else in my group wanted to speak Russian apart from when they had to, my knowledge in the language did not really expand much.

My point is, I still have a couple more years of my education, but other than a repeatable Russian conversation class, I have no more courses involving learning Russian. I am trying to get into medical school, but if that doesn't work out, I obviously need to use my degree as a back up. I'd love to teach English in Russia, but their political system is worse than the US, and the lack of good medical care and my lack of knowledge in Russian is worrying me.

I could probably get a translation job here, but fluency is needed, obviously. So, it is possible to become fluent here in America, without staying a specific amount of time in Russia? I still have my textbooks, and I do have friends over Skype I can talk to, but with the time difference and all, it's hard to have long discussions with them.

Anyone in the Kalingrad Area able to go to 62 Prospekt Pobedi and take some pictures for me?  For nostalgia!

1365801539.0	1c8dbv	Here's something of a hot button issue: Who is or isn't Russian and why do you see it the way you see it?		13	1	26	"We all know it. Being Russian (being anything) is not as simple as proclaiming that you belong to a culture and there; you are it, unquestionable member of Russia ancestrally, morally, economically, emotionally, etc. But I've gotta bring this up here. In my family it has never been an issue that we are Russians. Not one of us has been born in Russia in over three generations, but that was simply a non-issue when I was growing up. We were Russians and that is it. 
  
Well... Now I'm a grown up and I can think about things more complexly and am usually not in the least bit offended when someone tells me in all earnestness ""You are not Russian"". But that doesn't mean I'll take the suggestion about my identity. So here's the example to jumpstart the discussion - I really hope there is one:

A relative of mine (married into the family, not at all Russian) went to the doctor who was a born and bred Muscovite and said cheerfully ""Ah, my husband's family is also Russian! How nice"" and got a plain and simple answer from him: ""That last name is not Russian. The village you say they're from is not Russian. They don't get to be Russian"". He mellowed down a bit when he found out we all speak Russian and some of us play the balalaika. But still, he made a judgment and my entire family; say, about 10 generations worth, got placed in the non-admittance bag. 

The doctor was not being a mean or uniquely xenophobic person. What he has to say is ""listen, that village is way too far south to be in Russia and your last name sounds way too un-Russian"". His arguments are very well accepted and might even be exactly how some of you see it. For obvious privacy reasons, I'm not going to disclose my last name or the name of the village my family's from. But I'll tell you the last name sounds quite Bulgarian and the village is in modern day Ukraine. 

With that anecdote in mind, I'd like to hear some thoughts r/Russia has on the subject of being Russian. How do you see it and why do you see it like that? Is it about geography? Language? Ethnicity? Sheer self-representation regardless of public licensing of how Russian you are to anyone else? I'd love to hear your thoughts and please don't hesitate to be brutally honest. We've all got to know where we stand on these issues. "	t5_2qh75	True

Any ideas? Something connected to the Olympics in Сочи?

Now, as of right now, my knowledge of Russia is limited to the latter years of the Tsars, the Bolshevik revolution, Russia's involvement  in the Cold War, some modern-day Putin politics, the KHL hockey league (which I am a huge fan of), the issues and tensions with Chechnya (such as the theater and school incidents), as well as some modern-day military history.  Now before the semester starts, I was thinking I'll get a jump start on learning about Russia and her people.  This is where you come in...

1308015861.0	hz0s0	Another post with a couple of questions from an American studying in Russia this summer	balaklavaman067	12	2	19	"Здравствуйте, r/Russia! I'm another American student studying in Russia this summer, and I just had a couple of questions regarding a couple of topics that I haven't really found adequate answers for yet. I'm studying the language in Moscow for five weeks starting July 1, after studying Russian for the past year at my university here.

Firstly, I've seen conflicting answers on what kind of clothes I need to bring with me. What clothes do I need to fit in with the crowd as much as possible, if that's even possible to begin with, as well as just appropriate clothes to bring regarding weather, etc? On a more specific note, what should I be wearing to class every day? I've read that class decorum in Russia is considerably higher than in the States, and that entails dressing more nicely, but how nicely are we talking here? Does this mean, ""Don't wear tattered and messy clothes and tennis shoes,"" or ""Dress like you're going to work on a normal day,"" or ""Dress like you're having an important business meeting every day""? 

Secondly, I read somewhere in at least one case where someone was staying in a Russian hostel and he was reading online editions of Western newspapers and magazines (specifically Der Spiegel, IIRC), and the person believed the government was restricting his Internet access to things like email until he stopped and read things like the online English edition of Правда instead. This person had basically no concrete evidence to prove this, and I generally believe that stories about the government censoring free news is restricted mostly to reporters and journalists rather than the everyday people, but is a real thing in Russia? 

Thirdly, is there any other advice anyone has regarding things like being safe, things to do, cultural norms to adhere to, etc., that you wouldn't typically find in a guidebook, or a source to read up on this kind of information? I've read three different guidebooks on Moscow and several smaller online sources for this kind of information, and I've talked to a few different native Russians I know over here, so I have a pretty good idea I believe. 

One more thing - clubs and bars, good or bad idea? I'm a 20 year old male, but I wanted to know if I should try going out to check out the club scene I keep hearing tons about, of course with fellow students and people I know through mutual acquaintances. Also any advice about bars and clubs would be nice, and is it worth it to try to meet Russian women? I know how gorgeous seemingly all of them (under the age of 50) appear to be, but the stats on STDs, HIV, and lack of condom use kind of scare me. Anyways, thanks for tolerating another post from a clueless American - Большое спасибо!

I feel a little dirty going there - I'm aiding russiatrek.org to steal hits from the original content creators, a little used - DeIntegro, the redditor posting the links to russiatrek.org [does nothing on reddit except promote the site](http://www.reddit.com/user/DeIntegro) - and a little annoyed, because I now have to check the source before clicking on a link in r/Russia. If DeIntegro just posted links to the original content, I would be grateful to an active redditor, but as things are, I'm just annoyed.	t5_2qh75	True

---

Recently, Pavel Durov (the creator of vk.com) has made [a following comment](http://nikitskij.livejournal.com/256256.html) when discussing the Russian opposition (rough translation of the most important part follows):

&gt; There's no sense in dreaming about replacing ""corrupt rulers with honest ones"". It's just walking in a circle; the mentality of slaves that believe in good and evil kings. The free people's mentality is expressing itself in that they design and build systems, in which the king's character doesn't matter.

&gt; That's why the only thing that, theoretically, makes sense to discuss (if we lived in a different nation, where the people don't historically crave for strong kings) is replacing the heavy, bribe-capacious legislative systems with light, transparent ones.

&gt; I don't believe in honest politicians (that's an oxymoron), I believe in honestly designed systems.

&gt; I don't believe in unbiased appointed judges; I believe in the principles of jury courts and elected people's judges. I don't believe in big un-stealable state budgets; I believe in budgets of such a size, there's nothing to steal from, because most of the money stayed in the people's and businesses' hands. I don't believe in Russian officials that don't take bribes; I believe in conditions, in which there would be no reasons to give bribes to these officials. The latter may happen if the legislative system will suddenly start eliminating potentially corruptable regulations, licenses and checks for private initiatives.

And the current situation in Russia (I'm not talking about the homophobic laws right now.) seems to agree with that.

We have a universal health care system, but it leaves a lot to be desired in comparison to those in other countries with universal health care.

We have strict gun laws, but the [homicide rate is twice as high as in the U.S.](http://www.theworld.org/2013/01/gun-violence-russia/)

We have strict laws that are supposed to fight corruption, but they seem to be very selectively enforced. (In fact, quite a lot of laws in Russia can be classified as ""strict, but barely enforced"".)

The question is: 

Is Durov right or wrong? Do you think corruption in Russia can be fixed if better officials get elected, or are the problems indeed caused by our system? Can Russia become a social ""big government"" democracy (given the right elected officials), or the only way to fix corruption in Russia is to limit the role of the federal government?"	t5_2qh75	True

1374142867.0	1iju2f	Would Ukraine be better off under Russia?	Occultist	21	10	66	"I know, it's controversial.. and imperialistic etc etc. I'm not really Russian, so I should be allowed to make this suggestion. It's just something I've been thinking about and I wish we could discuss it objectively.

According to the World Bank, Russia has a GDP per capita of 23,549. Ukraine is at 7,418. The country is literally third world. Russia's economy has been growing rapidly the past decade and in spite of the recent slowdown its huge reserves of natural resources is bound to see it continue growing into the future. The megacity of Moscow is invaluable and potentially an incredibly strong economic engine, something Ukraine could never have anything close to on its own.

Russia's fertility rate, while still low, has improved by a lot lately. The latest figures puts it at 1.61. Ukraine? 1.29 and not improving at anywhere close to the same rate as Russia's. I mention this because it is one of the most important factors in determining the future of these respective countries.

I know many in Ukraine are looking towards Europe, but let's face it, that's never going to happen. A 45 million rapidly aging 3rd world country joining the EU? Yeah, no. 

Russia, however, would probably be interested in letting the outskirts into the heat - it is, after all, a federation; the infrastructure is already there. Ukraine would be given tons of autonomity within Russia and it's culture is very similar to the Russian culture compared to many of the other cultures found within the federation.

Ukraine, despite its relatively small size (compared to Russia), has a handful of great cities - Kiev, Odessa, for example. Also Donetsk, L'viv and Dnipropetvorsk. Not to mention Crimea. Ukraine has the potential to become a very popular holiday destination and it's low prices could help it steal western tourists from Bulgaria, Turkey, Egypt, Croatia etc. Not to mention Russia would get control of the oil pipelines running through Ukraine and thus avoid future problems relating to that. And Ukraine could stop worrying about buying hydrocarbons from Russia. Also, no more disputes regarding the Sevastopol naval base.

If Ukraine was merged into Russia it would give the federation a collective population of almost 190 million. Add Belarus to that and we're at 200 million, more than Brazil. Btw I guess everything I said also goes for Belarus.

It seems like Ukraine's future would look better as part of Russia. Right now the country does in fact seem doomed. Will Ukrainian's die a very proud people or swallow said pride for a possibly brighter future with Russia? To me, this seems to be the question that should be asked. When viewed objectively, it seems to be in both countries interest to merge.

Also, Georgia is next. Come on, a shared Russia-Turkey border would do great things for the world economy. Add Armenia (they probably wouldn't even mind that much, especially if we promised Nagorno Karabakh autonomy) and Azerbaijan (the fact that they wouldn't like it would only make the annexation that much more enjoyable) to that and you would get a shared border with Iran, as well!

You can ignore the last part. It's just.. food for thought. And as said, I'm not even Russian. And my girlfriend is Ukrainian. And I have an Armenian carpet."	t5_2qh75	True

Unfortunately, the attempts so far have either not been in-depth enough about the society and contemporary life, or the story isn't compelling enough to grip and hold attention.

One character I find particularly interesting is the ex-skinhead/convict Maxim ""Tesak"" Martsinkevich. My impression is that he has become somewhat of a mainstream public figure after his release (being invited to a lot of talk shows, etc.), and also has quite a big following among young people? I also hear he's doing commercials for protein powder or something?

It would be great to get some more extensive information on this from actual Russians. Does he have a large following? If so, why? How is that ""Occupy Pedophilia"" thing he's doing legal? I also know he has published a book. Is that accessible through mainstream bookstores in Russia?

Many thanks to those who can give me some extensive information about this guy and his post-prison life."	t5_2qh75	True

This will help us to understand the differences between us in a business perspective.  
I was wondering for exemple how do business negociation take place in russia ? For exemple, in France, we negociate during lunch for exemple and the lunch last a long time.  
Are there some  ""do's and don'ts"" to respect when dealing with russian companies ?  
What are the main focus while doing business with russians ?  
Is it really important for the product to be built in Russia or are they open for products build outside russia ?

I'm a Russian major, and lover of the Russian language. I've been studying the language off and on for many years now, but for the past two years I've been really intensely learning the language in my classes.

Vocabulary is never a problem, because that's usually rote memorization, and I use flash cards for that. However, the cases and their uses continue to be a problem for me, especially genitive, because of how many things it is used for, including numbers.

What is the best way to work on memorizing their uses and endings? Flash cards don't seem to help; there's too much information on each case.
