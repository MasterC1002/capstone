1351605129.0	12c5g9	Today my professor accidentally taught the whole class that our entire GOV is illegitimate. I pointed it out... Hilarity ensued.	scared2mosh	325	71	188	"So as many of you know my polisci class is so bad it's e-famous. (Twitter: @shitstatistssay). Today however was possibly the funniest day all semester.

We were discussing elections/voting and my professor said that ""GOV is only legitimate so long as it maintains the consent of the governed."" And that "" Voting is giving consent"". Minutes later she followed that up with the statistics that &lt;60% of citizens (or &lt;%37 of the population) actually vote (her numbers, not mine). 

I then asked:
""if government only has legitimacy through consent and only a little more than 1/3 of the population gives its consent, how can you say by your own definition that our government is legitimate in any sense of the word""

I was greeted with a blank stare and a stuttered answer about how it was still ""technically a majority"" to which I replied with one of my favorite quotes (from Lysander Spooner) ""The principle that the majority have a right to rule the minority, practically resolves all government into a mere contest between two bodies of men, as to which of them shall be masters"". At this point the class went into conniptions as several students actually understood what I was saying and wanted answers while 1 or 2 students and the proff tried to defend it with nonsense.

... It took nearly 10 min for the proff to regain control at which point she assigned homework and let us out 30 minutes early.

All in all it was the best class all semester, and I actually finally understand why voting is actually bad. I will however be heading to the polls on the 6th because she is giving out 40 extra credit points to anyone who votes... No word on if there are addition extra points for voting for Obama.

1352591292.0	12zhqc	Marxist-Leninist here, want to know the AnCap views on small legalities and general day-to-day business.		255	47	115	"1. Insofar as I've heard, anarcho-capitalists accept the 'voluntary' work contract as a binding entity between one person and another. What age does one have to be to accept a contract? 18? 12? 5 years old? Can I trick a 5 year old into signing away $200,000 of his wages for the next 20 years? Serious question. If there *is* an age limit, who enforces it?

2. What happens to orphans? Which for-profit orphan-collecting agency gets to pick them up from the street? Since you'd have hundreds of orphan-collection agencies competing against each other for paid adoptions, does that mean it's a ""finders-keepers"" deal to find a baby on the street? Would anyone inspect orphanages to make sure the orphans aren't mistreated?

3. What are the penitentiary systems going to be like in AnCapistan? Say I defraud millions of people, dump pesticides in waters, log down neighbourhood trees, disrespect your private property religion, etc., which 'voluntary' police force gets to arrest me, and which 'voluntary' prison am I put in ('voluntarily')?

**And no escaping these questions by saying anything like ""but communism doesn't fix it either"", I don't care about your views on communism, I want to know what *your* system does for these small examples I thought up above.**


**EDIT: Alright, thanks to all of you for replying to this! While I still have way too many disagreements with anarchist capitalism, mostly concerning property rights and the inevitability of a state, you answered my questions very precisely and I can understand the externalities of your ideology much more clearly. Thanks to everyone for letting me understand your beliefs.**"	t5_2qorf	True

Let the speculation end. He's now *officially* out.

Other fun story: John Stossel called him one night after Freedomwatch, and said ""You've got to stop saying 'taxation is theft' on your show. It's killing me!""

""Why?"" the judge asked.

""Every time you say it on your show, I get letters and emails asking why I don't say it,"" replied Stossel.

""Now that I know that, I'm going to say it every night!""

Edit: Story #2 (I'm holding some in reserve). The Judge says Rand Paul and Ron Paul are virtually identical in their personal principles, but Rand thinks he can do good by getting elected and isn't afraid to market himself to the necessary demographics. I still don't like it, but I'll take the Judge's word for it since he knows them."	t5_2qorf	True

My name is Josiah Tullis, I'm an Ambassador of [The Seasteading Institute](http://www.seasteading.org/). One of my main efforts has been using social media, especially Reddit, to build the seasteading community. Please keep in mind that The Seasteading Institute is entirely non-partisan and our community includes people from nearly every political party. That said /r/Anarcho_Capitalism has shown a great amount of interest in the concept, so I've decided to do an AMA hosted here so we can have a more targeted conversation about what an AnCap seastead might look like and how that would come to be.

[Here's](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josiah-tullis/why-doesnt-government-get_b_3338046.html) a brief piece I wrote in the Huffington Post that introduces the political theory behind seasteading and competitive countries.

(video inside)	Thanquee	170	23	167	"I've been a part of my school's debating society for 7 years, and this is my last year there so they asked me to represent anarchism in the debate 'this House would abolish the state'. Debates are three speeches a side, 5 minutes in length, with small speeches from the floor between the fourth and fifth speeches. That means I had 15 minutes in total in which to try to convince my friends that the state needs to be gotten rid of (although the operative verb really should have been 'dissolve' rather than 'abolish'). 

You're not going to get any gems of ancap theory here, but you might pick up some of the more obvious cliche arguments at the absolute entry level for trying to get people new to the idea to look at it from our perspective, and you might want to incorporate some of these ideas into your own arguments. 

I thought the Opposition's actual arguments were pretty terrible, but that was to be expected - they didn't adequately address quite *how* coercion is a better means of helping the poor than voluntary means, merely *that* it was permissible to do so. However, I thought the floor speakers raised a few valid points that a lot of statists take up with us.

The very last speech is pretty masturbatory and while it was gratifying to be told how great I was for two and a half minutes, even his substantive case in the second half of his speech was little more than scaremongering - something I thought ill-befitting of such a great debating coach.

These tend to be the arguments I use when giving the elevator-speech version of anarchism (at one point, you get to see the 20-second version of the ABCT which I'm pretty sure flew over most people's heads when I'm asked about my political views, so if you take issue with a particular argument or want to suggest ideas then please help me improve at persuading people.

Also, excuse my extremely camp spin-around when I get up out of my chair ;__;

Honestly though, I'm disgusted by the amount of authoritarianism present in the socialist community. It seems like half the people on /r/socialism these days are Stalin apologists or something similar. Just because I came to the conclusion that government is a necessary evil doesn't mean I stopped being pro free speech and civil liberties. Of course, you guys will probably tell me authoritarianism and left wing economics go hand in hand. Ironically, they'd probably agree with you.

Anyway, I'm currently annoyed with the whole socialist movement, so hit me with your best shot.

I'm JamesCarlin, the founder of /r/MarketAnarchism, a cooperation-focused meeting place for various schools of anti-statist thought.  If you are genuinely interested in answers to your questions about schools of anarchism which differ from yours, you might wish to stop by /r/MarketAnarchism, read the side bar, play nice, and then post your questions.

**Combative:**

Reading the various ""questions"" in our recent flood of visitors, it occurred to me that most of you were asking the wrong questions.  Most of the 'questions' I see are ""gotcha questions,"" and when answered, are treated combatively with a debate-like dynamic.  This demonstrates to me that you are not genuinely interested in a response, and instead mostly causing trouble and wasting time.  

**Educational:**

My suggestion is, **before asking a question, consider whether you are genuinely interested in the response.**  If you are genuinely interested, perhaps you will ask it in such a way you can learn something.  If you are genuinely interested in learning, perhaps you'll learn what *""Anarcho-Capitalism""* actually promotes, undermines, or doesn't care about.  Treating this as a learning opportunity will allow you to make informed decisions and help others do so as well.

**Note to AnCaps:**

AS a quick note to AnCaps, AnCap leaning individuals, and even non-AnCaps.  Beware whether the person is treating the communication as a combative exercise or an informative opportunity.  I recommend efficiently allocating your time towards learning and educational opportunities, and less towards those who are uninterested and combative.

When people argue giving money to schools, police, regulators, etc will create better outcomes, they are arguing that the ""turn signal"" actually means something.  It doesn't.

I don't wanna hear some shitty answer about how the government just has a monopoly right now, and killing brown people will get cheaper with competition.  The bottom line is, there are brown people, they hate me for my freedom, so they gonna hate me even more when I'm more free.

Rome was a great empire. Some of its biggest acheivements include massive road projects and aqueducts. The state used these public works to create the most powerful empire on the earth during their time. How can you argue that if everything was privately owned that the quality of life for Romans would have been better? 

Private prisons are already showing their flaws, they and unethical and abuse their power to make money by jailing people as much as possible. How would having more private prisons change the fact that they are abusing their power *right now* ?

Fire departments used to be privatized. due to the fact that they were inefficient and not motivated by helping people they were replaced by the much more effective state run system we have now. Did you know that? I don't understand how you could argue for privatization of everything when it has been proven to be less effective than state control historically. 

Schools used to be solely private institutions, would you have that again? A society where  the poor work and the rich go to school? Doesnt make much sense to me, our society has evolved to the point where public schools are a given.

so yeah, i am just not sure how you think anarcho capitalism would be a good idea at all when it has been disproven by history. Also read the book *Snow Crash* to see the logical conclusion of your beliefs.

Since you clicked on the title of this thread, I guess you want to debate me. You can pick any relevant topic you like. 

Here are a few suggestions:

* How is property legitimately created?

* Is the NAP a good/useful principle? 

* How do we determine who is or isn't autonomous?

* Does equal opportunity exist is an anarcho-capitalist society?

* When, if ever, is coercion justified?

* What is the basis of our morality?

* Would people be truly free in an anarcho-capitalist society?

You're, of course, welcome to come up with a topic of your own if you don't like any of my suggestions. 

But before you start typing, I have a few requests: 

1. Let's keep it simple and discuss only one topic at a time. Analysing and deconstructing arguments is tedious. If we bombard each other with several arguments at a time, then I fear our conversation will be too muddled. 

2. Be patient. I have other stuff to do so sometimes it may take days before I respond (sorry). 

3. I'm not interested in a ""who can one-up the other in insults"" competition. We both know that we don't like each other and you can remind me of that by occasionally insulting me if you want. However, if that's all you have to offer, then I'll ignore you.

4. No moral nihilists. Sorry guys, but I'm really not interested in a conversation with you. I feel that there isn't much we have to say to each other. 

**Edit:** 5. Responses shouldn't just consist of links to long videos or articles. Providing evidence is good, but I want to talk to *you*, not some author who can't respond to me. 

**Edit:** Away again."	t5_2qorf	True

1367787004.0	1dr0jp	I was arrested and held in a New York City jail for 16 hours overnight. Wall of text incoming.	oxidezx	137	28	130	"I'm sure some of you have been arrested before, but I never have. It sucked, and I feel the need to write about it and share my anarchist perspective. Here it goes.

Backstory: I was very drunk and very high. I had rode my bike out to the bar, as I often do. It was 4AM, and I was getting on the train to go home with this super cute girl I've known awhile.

In my drunkenness and to make her laugh, I started doing figure 8s with my bike on the train platform. All of a sudden some cops appear.

""FUCK YOU that's a $150 summons. You just made my night."" That's a quote.

So we go upstairs to the cop area, and they take my ID. I go to take off my bike chain from around my waist to sit down, and they start screaming and put their hands on their guns. I am talking mad shit to them because I already know what's coming next.

They run my info and they see my unpaid open container from last year, a Corona on Coney Island. There's a warrant out for my arrest and I'm going to jail. I give my bike and cell phone to the girl, in lieu of ""vouchering it"" with the police. 

I calmly tell the police that by kidnapping my under threat of force they have committed a far more violent act than I have, and that I do not respect their blue costumes earned from a 6 month training course. They do not like this. They say ""oh god white people are the worst.""

In the car I ask them if they've ever had a beer on the beach. One says yes, in the Dominican. I ask them if they are religious, and if morality is relative or absolute. They have no answer.

I ask them if they ever use the word ""hero"" to describe themselves. They get angry.

Once finally booked, after fingerprint scan, iris scan, and multiple photos of my visible tattoos, I am thrown into a cell with about 50 other guys. We are then separated further into two holding tanks, one for felonies and one for misdemeanors. My wrists are cut and bleeding from the handcuffs.

In the misdemeanor holding tank ""oldport"" I am one of about 25. There are 2 other white people. One is a dopesick teenager who was caught with heroin. He's very sick and been there for 3 days. The rest are latin and black.

The most serious crime was an older guy who was caught with a box of bullets. A few teenagers are there for selling weed. Most are victims of ""stop and frisk"" who had a warrant because of an unpaid open container. One guy was stopped for spitting on the street and then arrested for his unpaid ticket.

It is like 100 degrees in the cell and it stinks. Everyone is coughing and sneezing. An old guy who does not have all his faculties shit himself. We are given a filthy bucket of water to all share to share. When it runs out, there is no more provided. There are several pallets of milk (the same I remember from public high school) that are bloated and leaking. We are told to drink those. They give us bread and cheese. I do not consume anything and tell everyone that if they do, they will develop Stockholm Syndrome. Some dudes think that's funny and we make friends. I hand out business cards. The state will not stop me from networking.

After another 12 hours I meet with my public defender and am taken to court. I am given an [ACD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjournment_in_contemplation_of_dismissal) which is essentially a dismissal and am free to go. 

The $200+ in fines I owe is magically wiped away. It is obvious to all that our detainment helps the city in regards to the receipt of state and federal funds for law enforcement. The best part was the anti-government sentiment. There were no violent criminals and no thieves. Just some drunks and some kids - victims of state power."	t5_2qorf	True

In other discussions I've had with more standard marxist ""pure"" anarchists, I've not had the pleasure of such intelligent discourse, and was generally exposed to a lot of rigid dogma and identity politics without much rationality or evidence to back it up. 

In fact, personal attacks from anarchists were far more common than reasoned discussion, and generally left me with a  foul taste in my mouth after interaction, and witnessing the same behavior inflicted on others.

I'm not an anarchist, although I do find merit in many of the underlying principles, and I want to thank you all for the tolerance, respect for freedom of expression, and logical discourse that I find here at /r/anarcho_capitalism that I have not found at other online anarchist communities.

You're full of your self. Are you so convinced that everyone should have a gun, with no idea of the consequences?

Are you so weak that the thought of not having a gun would mean being someone's bitch?

You're pathetic.

I would bet my life that you would piss and shit your little baby pants if you were ever in an actual life and death situation.

You have no idea what it means to have an education, to actually know how important it is for others to have an education.

""If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said 'faster horses'"" (attributed to Henry Ford, although I'm not sure he actually said it).

Reason I'm thinking about it in the context of AC is that it clearly illustrates the futility of trying to convert people to a system that they cannot yet see for themselves, compared to the power of showing it when you've actually set it up.

In business, when you have an idea to improve what is there, you don't spend years of your life trying to convince future customers before starting the business.  You start a new business, make the new product, and then show it to a target audience who either buy into it or not.

You also don't try to sell it to just anyone.  This is where the word ""target audience"" becomes particularly important.  There are early adopters, people who have a natural interest or propensity to buy your product because of the alignment of preferences they have in other areas of their life.  Then come the other waves of customer groups.

But it's absolutely key to actually have the product already there for all to see.  Think about, say, Bitcoin.  We could have spent years talking about the benefits and drawbacks of an alternative, private currency.  Satoshi didn't talk about it, he built it and now we see the widening circles of adopters being attracted to it.  Simple.

Which leaves ACs with three options, as I see it: seasteading, charter cities and virtual state interaction systems (i.e. interfaces between groups of taxpayers and existing states, like Groupons for taxpayers).  

The sooner ACs can make those options happen, the sooner the world's eyes will be opened to an alternative that isn't just ""faster horses"".

*Their discussion concerned the unemployed, and their plight.*


*Krugman shouted, “We aren’t spending enough, consumption is key!”*

*Bernanke nodded, but where to get the money? Ah, of course, QE3.*


*Off to the printing press, to print billions more;*

*The FED would buy bonds; GDP would soar.*


*However, months later, things weren’t going as expected;*

*GDP was up, but confidence down, and the unemployed were basically unaffected.*


*It was times like these, in the dead of night, lying in bed,*

*That the strangest of thoughts crept into Bernanke’s head.* 


*What if printing was nothing more than a temporary fix?*

*In a single stroke hard earned savings would be utterly nixed.*


*What if buying bonds just made the outlook bleaker?*

*Or worse, created a bubble, whose membrane was getting weaker and weaker…*


*Bernanke shot up, drenched in a cold sweat.*

*His heart was racing, his underpants wet.*


*In times like these only one thing could calm him, put him at ease;*

*He looked out the window, put on his coat, grabbed his keys...* 


*His neighbors often report the strangest of sights;*

*A panicked old man unlocking his shed in the dead of night.*


*What’s in the shed no one’s quite sure, but many rumors have been told.*

*Most witnesses swear to seeing a man fondling bars of pure gold.*

Him: Hello, are you the president of this COMPANY.

Me: Yes

Him: What is your name?

Me: NAME.

Him: Hello Mr. NAME, I am calling on the behalf of the RCMP. Just to let you know from the start - there are no problems. This is a friendly call and I am calling on behalf of a foundation that we have for the RCMP. I usually tell people right away that there are no problems because from experience people get a bit nervous if I don't say that right away HAHAHA.

Me. haha, thats funny. /s

Him: So, I am calling because we are trying to solve the problem of drugs in your neighbourhood. Did you know that drugs ruin lives Mr. NAME. Kids as young as 6 are taking drugs in your neighbourhood. We are asking for donations to complement our budget because the government isn't giving us enough to eradicate this problem. The government is not doing their job that's why we are calling you today.

Me: Well I always thought that prison ruined lives, not the drugs themselves.

Him: Right and we need to intervene early to stop them from taking drugs. Recently we busted a drug factory that produced over 6,000,000 pills of (some product I forgot the name) which contains 60% more of the active ingredient heroin has. They even put facebook logos and the Montreal canadian logo on the pills to help them advertise it to kids. Things are really bad.

Me: Well I would need more information before I could make a decision.

Him: Well the only way we can accept donations, because we are the police, is for you to send the funds to our foundation. ... So what additional information would you need.

Me: I just want to understand what the money will be used for, so if you could send me an email to /interupted

Him: It will be used to help fight drug crime in your neighbourhood. We have advertising space that you can buy. If you would like your company ad on a full page of the RCMP calendar it would be 800$ per year. If you would like your company's ad to be the size of a business card it would be 300$ per year. So Mr. NAME would your company be able to commit to any of these offers?

Me: Listen, I am philosophically opposed to what you are doing in regards to drug enforcement so there is no way I would commit to such a program.

Him: Well we have to do this because the government is not doing its job of paying us enough to do it.

Me: No I mean the seizure of the drugs that you mentioned earlier, a lot of people could have been killed.

Him: No one got killed.

Me: But they might have and even if no one did, their lives was put at risk.

Him: Well what would you suggest we do then?

Me: Two things: One, resign. Two, Legalize.

Him: ... *pause* ... Alright, we respect your opinion Mr NAME. /hangs up/

I've noticed that lots of people my age will acknowledge that war is mass murder, taxation is theft, and lots believe that conscription is slavery. The kids that are considered ""average"" or ""stupid"" are far less statist than those considered ""intelligent"". Today I presented a project in which I quoted Rothbard's excellent summary of statism, 

""For centuries the State has committed mass murder and called it “war”; then ennobled the mass slaughter that “war” involves. For centuries the State has enslaved people into its armed battalions and called it “conscription” in the “national service.” For centuries the State has robbed people at bayonet point and called it “taxation.” The State has cloaked its criminal activity in high-sounding rhetoric.""

I expected to be bombarded with cries that taxation is not theft, but I was surprised. I could tell that even the hardcore statists could not argue this. 

Teachers, on the other hand, are more convinced that statism is a moral system. But for them too, I could see that they were very disturbed by this reality. 

Sadly, most people do not apply this reality to their political views. If they agree that taxation is theft and that theft is morally wrong, they can't seem to apply that to statist policies that rely on taxation. It's like they are missing a link. They can't connect, for example, the drug war with taxation. They can't see that supporting government healthcare is supporting taxation, which is theft. They can't understand that regulations are enforced by the gun of the state, but they will agree that pointing guns at people is wrong.

Anyway, the point is, be hopeful. Kids aren't so stupid. They can see the truth that most adults have chosen to ignore."	t5_2qorf	True

1338330923.0	ub339	Free Market Monopoly (board game)	rob777	118	26	62	"My dad made a game while he was in college called ""Spec"", short for speculation, and he recently introduced it to the family. The game is basically free market Monopoly, where everything is negotiable. We usually played with 6 people so that: 2 people started with all the properties, 2 people started with all the cash, and 2 people started with all the hotels and houses (each had an equal number of houses and hotels). So basically the game starts with established oligopolies (duopolies?). 

Note: There are many other ways to start, but this is usually how we begin. 

* **Property**-Property comes up for auction whenever it is landed on for the first time. The real estate agents have the rights to the property (but do not ""own"" them per se; they collect no income unless they buy them) so they collect the proceeds from the auction. The property goes to the highest bidder. The real estate agent cannot bid in the auction (bidding would just consist of them bidding everything they have and then giving themselves back the money in addition to the property they just ""bought"") but has the right to sell her right/claim on the property to any other individual who is more interested in the money from the auction than the property being sold. For example, if Player A is a real estate agent and Player B just landed on one of the properties that Player A owns the ""listing"" for, the property immediately goes up to auction (this is assuming the property has never been landed on before). We'll say that Player B doesn't really want to try to buy the property but Player A does. Player B and Player C now try to outbid each other to buy the ""listing"" from Player A. We'll say that Player B wins with a bid of $1000. Player A pockets the $1000 and can now take part in the auction for the right to fully own the property. Player A, Player C, and Player D now try to outbid each other to buy the property. We'll say Player A wins with a bid of $2000. Player B pockets the $2000 and Player A now has full ownership of the property. 
One of the very few things that is not negotiable in the game is the amount charged when someone lands on a property you own. We always go by what the property card indicates: number of houses, hotels, multiple of dice roll, or whatever.

* **Contracts**-Contracts are a **huge** part of this game, so you're going to need a pretty good amount of paper and pens. Contracts are made for loans, partnerships, business plans, and anything that can pop into your head that someone else will agree to. In the games that I've played, contracting helped us reach a higher level of sophistication and allowed gameplay to carry on more smoothly. I'll mention this more when I talk on other things.

* **Acquisitions, Mergers, Initial Public Offerings, and Other Investments**- The option to buy someones property is always open as long as they agree to it. Usually in the middle of the game we see a lot of mergers where owners of say board walk and park place agree to merge so that they can both get the benefits of owning the ""set"". In this way they can put hotels or houses on their property and gain a much larger income. The percentage that each person owns is up to negotiation between the partners. In a set of 3, each of the individuals usually own 33% of the company unless someone is bring hotels or houses to put on the properties. In sets of two it's usually 50/50 or when someone brings in hotels we see 60/40, 65/35 or something of that sort. Now again, those aren't *rules* those are just trends that I see in negotiations.
Sometimes when someone is running low on capital they'll do an IPO and sell stock of their company to help them get back on their feet. I'm sure you guys already know the basics of this so I won't go too far into it. Bottom line, part of the profits go to other players in exchange for some quick cash. Also, all of these deals are done through contract with the parties involved.

* **Investment Management**-This has been the newest idea and needs more testing (hopefully that's where you guys come in) but it works by one player starting an ""investment fund"". The hardest part (as in real life) is to convince other players to let the fund manager temporarily invest their money. The fund works by asking players for use of their money for a short amount of time (say two or three turns). After all the money for the fund has been collected, the percentage ownership needs to be worked out and written down (if two players each put $500 in the fund, they have 50/50 ownership) and the fund managers cut needs to be negotiated (10% of profit or whatever they agree to). The fund manager has to entice other players to let him buy *temporary* partial ownership of their sets. For example, if the fund manager has $1000 to invest he may make an agreement with the Boardwalk Parkplace Co. to buy 20% ownership for two turns for a price of $400. The fund manager may then make an agreement with the owners of  Pacific Ave. North Carolina Ave. and Pennsylvania Ave. (green properties at end of board) for 35% ownership for two turns for a price of $350. After the two turns are up the money is handed to the original investors in the fund according to what percentage they own of the fund. So if each put in $500 originally and therefore have 50/50 ownership, they would divide the returns equally between the two of them after the fund manager takes a percentage cut of the profit of course. All of this would best be done through contracts of course. This is a good strategy to have if you do not end up owning the Boardwalk/Parkplace set or dark green set.

* **Loans**- The players that start out with the cash (bankers) are always hungry to give loans and there's always demand for them. Whenever we first played the game the bankers bid each other down to loans with 1% interest. We slowly saw interest rates rise but never very much. We've come a long way and have since understood that you can't make any money of these unless the interest rate is at least 10%. This is usually around where the interest rates stay, but again everything is up for negotiation and it's not just the original bankers that could give out loans either. Anyone who has the capital can make loans and co-author the contract with the other party. (Notice how much we use written contracts? lol)

* **Insurance**-This is a fairly new concept in our games so we don't have very much experience, but basically someone would contract with another player to put in a certain amount of money in the event that they were going bankrupt. In exchange they would pay them a fee on every one of their turns. Insurers could then contract with Re-insurers using the same concept. If the insurer took a big hit by paying for some one else to be bailed out, the re-insurer would pay a certain amount to the insurer in exchange for small fees paid by the insurer to the re-insurer. 

* **Law**- There haven't been many problems with enforcement because everything has really been taken care of by contracts. However, we have had an unofficial form of polycentric law. When we play we usually have a large group of familly and friends sitting around who aren't playing, so if a dispute comes up that hadn't been clarified or enforced by a contract we'll ask one of them whose opinion we would respect on the issue. Now this is very informal but still efficient. In the future we'll probably set contracts as to which neutral friend or relative we use to settle disputes or if we have to use only other players we'll have to include clauses where bribing the arbiter will result in immediate loss in the case as well as paying the amount of bribe plus a penalty fine to the other party in the court case. It would also be a good idea to set up a list of arbiters to make an appeals court process. If the loser of the court case appeals to the next arbiter in line his objectives would be twofold: 1. convince arbiter 2 that arbiter 1's reasoning was based on things outside of the case or that arbiter 1 had other motives 2. if arbiter 2 has been convinced of arbiter 1's fault then the cases must be argued. Arbiters may have to be paid in order for them to give their services. In that case, they would have to compete for clients.  Who knows. Overall, we don't have many disputes that can't be solved, but there are still some.

* **Bankruptcy**- We still need to formalize the process of bankruptcy but how it has usually gone: pay player who you immediately owe. Auction off property houses, hotels, or loans and other assets if need be. Pay oldest debts first working towards newest debts incurred. Some possibilities: **Chapter 7**- Individual is completely insolvent and will be going out of the game (or they may just want to quit playing and declare chapter 7). The mutually agreed upon arbiter of creditor and debtor helps sell assets to pay off debts as fairly as the arbiter can decide. After assets have been auctioned off, the player is officially out of the game. **Chapter 13**- The individual is insolvent but has a decent capital structure that can be worked with. The arbiter of the creditor and debtor helps negotiate how much debt can be forgiven or suggest payment plans. Purpose of Chapter 13 is to reorganize debt to help creditors get some of their money back and so the individual in debt does not go out of the game prematurely. 

**NOTE:**This game is actually incredibly hard to win. Most last 4-6 hours and many have gone unfinished. Turns out that free markets are actually pretty fair. Who would've thought?

**MISSION SUCCESS**

Edit: Spelling, grammar, format, example in property section for clarity, added investment management section (forgot on accident), added more content on polycentric law with and without players as arbiters, and added ideas for chapters 7 &amp; 13 bankruptcy. Also, we usually don't play with chance or community chest."	t5_2qorf	True

&gt; No. What your interlocutor said is a matter of fact. You are wrong, and your interlocutor ruined your hypothetical magical argument with that simple fact. Now that your interlocutor has ruined your approach, you try to fog and deceive others with the mealy-mouthed ""uhhhh it's a matter of perspective, who owns the house is like, your opinion MAAAAAAAAAAN"".

&gt; I'm sorry you think that way. I wish not to attack anyone. What I said was correct. If you don't pay your mortgage, the bank owns your house. It's simple.

&gt; This is still inefficient and not socially optimal. Also, ostracism or boycotting of corporations who don't comply with the law or regulation doesn't seem like it would work. If you offer a good enough product at a low enough price, people will still buy it no matter how unethical your business practices are (see: Walmart, Apple).

&gt; So all of the services that the government provides that cause pollution will simply cease to exist in a free market? That seems inefficient.

&gt; Efficiency? Efficiency? That's your criticism? BAHAHAHAHAHA! For the love of Wotan, gimme a breather here!

Posted by an ancap: +17 (23/6)

In another post, crackheadphilosopher finds a reference for what he was talking about and has -2 total score. 

**Personal note:** You laugh at /r/politics and /r/anarchy for silencing you through downvotes but you do the same. What seems so obvious to you (that markets always behave more efficiently than monopolies) may not seem as obvious to others. Just as what seems obvious to people at /r/politics (that a land without government is chaos) is something that you vehemently object to.

So what do you do? You criticize the people who mock and you downvote the person who came with questions. 

/r/Anarcho_Capitalism is only different from /r/politics in size. I believe that if we grew to anything near their size the amount of ignorant people here who enjoy the circle jerk and despise objections would simply gain a stronger voice.

**Edit:** Here is the post I'm referring to: http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/tnfx2/my_objections_to_anarchocapitalism/

**Edit 2:** I'm still going through this post by crackheadphilosopher and I think some more should be pointed out. At one point he mentions how a Dicken's article shows what can happen if anarcho-capitalism is allowed. Now his logic is not sound, I would agree with that but he defends the point well even though he is wrong (I believe, anyway). He has a score of -10, perhaps that's justifiable when he uses a poor argument but the following post says ""Dude, I read a Heinlein novel and the future looks trippy. It's all good, dog."" and has a positive score of +14... Really? We upvote condescension? "	t5_2qorf	True

My question for r/Ancap is, if there is no government, and only pure capitalism, what is to stop the corporations from creating monopolys over everything, and poluting the rivers and air, and making everyone become like the fat people in The pixar movie, Walle.

Now, I know that this question sounds very elementary, but I have given serious thought and consideration to this question and the only way I can see this not happening, is if the people rise up against the corporations that are creating monopolys, but my fear is two things: 
1. Not enough people would join the strikers in breaking up the monopolys
2. If the company is to strong, they would hire guards to ""disperse the rebels"" and ultimatly, we would have a society purely dominated by corporations and big buisnesses. 

I am well aware that Anarchy means ""rules with out rulers"" but if there are no rulers, and no one there to enforce the rules, who's to stop people from breaking the rules, like the corporations. 

So. Can someone explain to me, how in an anarchist society, the business's wouldn't get to power hungry and dominate and control everything? 

EDIT: Thank you everyone, I really appreciate it. Im not an ancap now, but I have definitely found the answer to my question. I would also like to thank you all for not bashing me out for being a ""leftist statist"", but rather answering my question. Im not one to ""bash"" other political ideologies, because no one was raised the same, and everyone has different trains of thought. So I respect that, and I respect all of you for treating me with dignity and respect.

WASHINGTON -- The FBI, in aided in its investigation by the NSA and DEA, today issued 38 subpoenas to Internet-related companies and individuals, sources report.

The full list includes Netscape, AOL, eBay, Yahoo!, Lycos, GeoCities, HotMail, Tim Berners-Lee, and Marc Andreessen. 

FBI Director Robert Mueller issued the following statement: ""If the Internet remains a virtual Wild West for narcotraffickers and other criminals, that would not only threaten our country’s national security, but also the very existence of the Internet industry as a legitimate business enterprise.""

Indeed, experts have speculated on the possibility of Internet applications that aid terrorists and put at risk our national security interests.

""Suppose maps become digitized and freely available on the Internet"" says a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security. ""Suddenly, terrorists have access to military grade technology for selecting, scoping, and planning their attacks. Citizens will be helpless. Access to such tools must be strictly controlled""

Technologies to send mail electronically, dubbed ""e-mail,"" have also raised concerns. Experts predict that this tool will be exploited by pedophiles around the world to distribute child pornography. ""Regulation of E-mail is our top priority"" says Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe. ""We have made it our goal to ensure that every E-mail sent is tracked and stored. This database will be made accessible to law enforcement officials around the country, to ensure our nations safety.""

Cyber-anarchists, who oppose regulation of the Internet, have pushed forward the dangerous concept of ""net-neutrality."" This idea has been denounced by spokesmen for the movie, music, radio, newspaper, book, magazine, advertising, television, and sports industries: ""It will destroy jobs, plain and simple. Net-neutrality is nothing more than a ploy to subvert and destroy our time tested business models.""

Not all in the industry oppose regulation, however. Says Cisco CEO John Chambers: ""Regulation is a sign that the Internet is reaching mainstream acceptance, which is why we are partnering with the NSA to install hardware based tracking on all our routers. Such moves can only bring legitimacy to the Internet."""	t5_2qorf	True

I mean, shit.... it's basically these government workers telling you what ""happened"", always touting their personal political beliefs saying how democracy came out on top and how no other system will work. All this brainwashing from the age of 5 till the age of 18.


No wonder there are so many statists. I mean, it worked on me... Now that I'm not being bombarded with this shit 8 hours a day I've discovered that anarchy isn't a crackpot theory and it can work... All that studying and memorization was a huge fucking waste of my life.

Side Note: What kind of things that were commonly taught in U.S. public schools are straight up not true?

http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/16gtus/any_other_quasianarchocapitalists/

Honestly, guys, I have to say I'm appalled by all the answers given there. Taken together, they call for a complete rejection of the AnCap position on almost anything. I'm not saying there aren't areas of legitimate debate in AnCap (children's rights, abortion, and to an extent intellectual property), but the objections raised are not really ones that I would expect out of AnCaps...

Here are some things users mentioned:

- NAP absolutism - So when are you allowed to enslave me and why?

- Rejection of Lockean Proviso - When are you allowed to decide how much property *I* can gain and why? What better right do you have to the property? 

- Absentee ownership - How do you engage in long-term speculation without absentee ownership

- Blurring of person and property (self ownership) - Really? This is a silly qualm of left-libertarians who for some reason can't understand the idea of a person having a right to exclude others from his or her body.

- Foggy nature of homesteading - Sorry dude, homesteading is very much a matter of culture and local customs. Just because it's fuzzy doesn't mean it's bad. I am not sure there is an a-priori stance on the exact requirements for homesteading.

- Rejection of the coercive nature of property rights claims - So, rejection of property rights? Including the property rights over yourself, because apparently that's coercive? Remember, guys, property rights are created to *prevent* coercion.

- Assumes property rights a priori - Not really. There are many justifications for property rights which do not start out as axioms.

- Market fundamentalism - This is one of the ones that baffle me most. An anarcho-*capitalist* argues against markets? And what's the alternative?

- ""I think we need to recognize the possibility for [DROs etc.] to rule over geographic regions using violence and become de facto governments."" - I think we need to read Hasnas's paper on the rule of law: http://faculty.msb.edu/hasnasj/GTWebSite/MythFinalDraft.pdf

- ""The NAP is getting used too often as an excuse to use violence against others. It's far to easy to spin any scenario into a subjective experience of being attacked and therefore a reason to defend ourselves."" - No it's not. Violence is a pretty definitive thing. As to the understanding of violence, that will be settled through case studies in courts - and it's really not that difficult to understand. I'm fairly certain even statist courts have it pinned down.

- ""When property gets abandoned needs particular attention. Locke seems to have answered this with the idea of labor spoiling within property"" - I agree that abandonment needs some attention, but labor spoiling within property? Labor isn't some thing, some living breathing entity that can go bad and rot. Labor is an action. As such, it can't spoil. Locke's fuzzy wording appears to have caused much mischief to classical liberalism. It's time to categorize Locke with Smith - useful in their time, but improved on later.

- ""I think we need to bury the hatchet regarding absentee ownership with the left. I don't necessarily agree with all their views on the subject, but ownership needs a continuous input of labor by the owner."" - So how do you engage in long-term speculation without absentee ownership? I agree that there must be some criterion for abandonment, but rejecting absentee ownership isn't the solution.

- ""Enclosure is a real problem and without an objective approach to abandonment, then there will be nothing available to future generations to claim as their own through their own labor."" - Besides, like, working for people through the market. Why does the market suddenly fail?

I don't mean to stop all debate and exploration outside of ""standard"" AnCap thought, I just want to remind people of the fundamentals they learned long ago.

-approx. 60% of every company that is listed on Slovenia's stock exchange is owned by the government (either directly or through various funds or companies owned by the government). They're also the dominant product/service providers on their field (can anyone spell monopoly?). A single airport with a single air company that's based on it-state owned. One and only cargo port-state owned. One of the remaining pharmaceutical companies (we managed to sell the other one) - state owned. The biggest insurance company- state owned (the government also owns the second biggest).

-enforced minimal wage (760€) makes roughly 70% of the average paycheck (1000€)

-the biggest income tax bracket is set on 15,6k€ per year and you have to pay 41% of your income to the state

-if you want to open a company and start doing business you're forced to pay YOURSELF in your OWN COMPANY the state prescribed minimal wage

-to do that you have to pay for the state owned pension fund (obligatory), state owned social fund (obligatory), state owned health fund (obligatory) various other insurances. To pay your employe (or yourself in your own company) 700€, you have to add up around 400-500€ that go to the state. It will cost an employer around 1,1k or 1,2k€ so that the worker can get his or her minimal wage.

-obligatory social and pension payments are by no means limited. What does that mean? If you want to pay your employe, let's say, 5k€ per month you'll have to pay additional 6k€ to these funds. 11.000€ are spent by an employer so an employe can get his 5000€. Yes, you read that correctly.

-on the other hand...the maximum pension or social welfare check that one can get ARE LIMITED. It doesn't matter if you paid 200€ or 6000€ per month, the maximum social welfare check is set around 600€.

-the so called social and ""fair"" healthcare that we can enjoy in exchange? My friend broke his tooth last week. He's classified as an urgent but not critical case and will be getting a thorough exam...wait for it...in 175 days. That's just so they will check out what happened and how could they treat this. To actually do something he could wait up to 450-650 days. He will of course pay for a much better and faster treatment in a private hospital from his own pocket. Even though he payed hundreds upon hundreds and hundreds of euros in the state owned health fund.

This is what happens if you put ""XXX is a social state"" in the first sentence of your constitution. There's tons of other stuff that just makes you mad and angry what can still be around in the 21st century and inside of EU's borders."	t5_2qorf	True

Edit: Apparently they are their own county taking care of security, fire department, and gas and sewage lines. Now obviously this is not a fair comparison to a regular city/county because it is a resort, however, this at least should explicitly prove that it is possible.

Thoughts on Nordic countries like Sweden"	ThatRedEyeAlien	90	14	61	"Living in Finland, where pretty much everyone is a social democrat, and those who are called ""right-leaning"" people are actually just moderates at most (e.g. Kookomus (National Coalition), our rightmost party, supports the welfare state with public schools/hospitals/etc.), you often get this ""comeback"" that the United States is a prime example of free markets and it doesn't work well there when you argue for a free market.

This is a stupid claim, of course. Heritage [ranks](http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking) the United States at 10th place for most economically free, while Finland is at 16th place. The United States has over 80 000 pages of regulations. In Louisiana, you need to spend many thousands of dollars to be allowed to be a *florist* as apparently occupational licenses are so important, because if you buy a ""bad"" (i.e. not-state-approved) bouquet of flowers, you will no longer know what to do. Finland is also planning to cut its corporate tax from the current 24.5% to 20%; meanwhile, the US has the highest nominal corporate tax rate at 35% (of course, no one actually pays that much tax, or the small companies might do it, but corporations won't).

Of course, in Sweden, which is similar, individuals pay roughly 70% of their wages in taxes on average according to Swedbank. Individuals have to pay much. Companies do not, however. If they were forced to, they would just move out of the countries. Nevermind Finns still arguing that taxes don't discourage companies.

I really find that one of the greatest issues when arguing for liberty is this misconception that the United States is really all that capitalist, when fascism would describe the system better. The high prices of healthcare and education in the US, for instance, is blamed on the *free market*. People really have no idea that those are some of the most regulated sectors on the market! Based on this, they argue that the [Nordic model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model) is way superior.

I'm sure Americans get this a lot too. On reddit, not a day goes by without praising Sweden, however:

1. Sweden/Finland/Denmark/Norway/Iceland are in many ways more capitalist than the US.
2. These countries all had strong economic growth *before* the implementation of any welfare state. This is always completely dismissed. People even argue that it is *because* of the welfare state that Finland has a strong economy.
3. They dismiss the fact that Sweden almost went bankrupt due to the welfare state in the 90's and since then they have cut down on it.
4. In Finland, many municipalities have bad economies as the state government give them more and more tasks all the time.
5. All these countries have aging populations and by 2050 roughly half of Finland's population will be retired (compared to 1/4th today). These countries are reluctant to accept immigrants too. The government gets less tax-money, and at the same time they have to pay more out in retirement checks. This is a *huge* future problem.

Oh, nevermind them calling anyone who doesn't support the welfare state. I'm sure giving ""free"" healthcare to some of the richest people in the world helps starving children in Africa.

Also, if you try to tell them the United States isn't capitalist you are either stupid or brainwashed because *everyone* ""knows"" that ""the United States is the benchmark of capitalism"".

I don't think of myself as either socialist or capitalist but i consider anarchism a distinct category as in that without power-structures based on myths and violence we will get to see which prevails be it free communes or free markets(personally i think it would be kind of mixed which in my opinion would be a very good thing). The problem with r/Anarchism is the amazing amount of intolerance they show to AnCaps and christians. It's all about Bakunin, Chomsky, Proudhon and Kropotkin. They focus on anarchism as a modern phenomenon and don't give any attention to the fatc that Taoists, Cathars and Hussites were the originators. They equate and confuse religious institutions with the religious message and again ignore history. The oppressive machinery they oppose is a tight mixture of religious institutions, the state, rigged and unreliable markets AND the spirit of politically correct - liberal mental slavery their site-info ignores because as much as they dislike it; r/anarchism is still a hivemind of pseudo-marxists and atheists who seem to be working on no goal other than that of claiming ownership of what the concept of anarchism is. All i can do when i see the 1 of May posters is laugh and dream of the day when these people look themselves in the mirror and concede the fact that they're not better than everybody else.	t5_2qorf	True

Beetle559	81	7	42	"One of the biggest barriers we have to cross in reaching the statist mind is their absolute belief that society needs to value x in order to function. They believe that society must be forced to adopt the value x in order to achieve a better society and that leaves libertarians out cold because our x value is to never use force unless in self defense.

Broad brush examples:

Conservatives - People need to have a strong moral code and a sense of independence in order for society to functions, we must elect conservatives and write laws that uphold these values or the liberals will destroy these values and therefore society.

Liberals - People need a sense of fellowship and equality in order for society to function, we need to elect liberals and write laws that uphold these values or conservatives will destroy these values and therefore society.

That's why they froth at the mouth over the most inane crap like birth control.

In my view the belief that society stems from values is erroneous and damaging, society stems from wealth. I hate to say it but our values are a luxury. You'll note that despite the opposing values of conservatives and liberals they interact with each other daily, they're even friends in many cases and some of them even married. These people aren't willing to go to war with each other over their differences.

The idea that people would join enclaves and go to war over IP laws or privacy in a free society is absurd, it's ludicrous. We'd debate sure, we'd flame each other on the internet absolutely, we might even get vocal once in a while. Then we'd sit down and play video games or eat dinner or something."	t5_2qorf	True

1339262461.0	utdb3	A brief story about how I was robbed and lost faith in the police	G_O_B_Bluth	87	13	33	"So I was robbed/burglarized last weekend. Someone came through my back slider that I leave unlocked, went through my house and stole my iPad, some clothes, and other miscellaneous stuff. About $1000 worth of stuff... not the end of the world. I admit I have very little security to protect my property. I just assumed the area I lived in was free of methheads... apparently not.

So the cops come and seem legit. I don't have many personal negative experiences with cops so I maintained that most cops are decent people, they just don't understand the implications of their profession. Anyways, they are super friendly, take fingerprints, find footprints in the backyard, sound very hopeful, and give us a direct contact for our case.

For about 3 days, the cop kept calling us to ask us if the find my iPad feature was working. Of course I tried that the second I found out it was gone. It wasn't working. He kept asking the question in new ways as if he has never touched a computer. 

On the 3rd day, pictures from iCloud start showing up on my phone. I'm talking detailed face shots of 2 people and piles of drugs. I email them to our detective and he claims they have 4 detectives working on it running it through their facial recognition software to compare it against prior arrest records. I'm thinking ""ok, worth a try"". Another day later, they haven't called back and won't answer my calls so I post the pics on Reddit. Within an hour, someone responds with a name. I find a facebook account, and prior arrest records on the internet. I send them to the cops. The detective says he's not convinced but he'll send off the information. He calls back 20 minutes later and says begrudgingly ""ok, we've sent out deputies to the last known address"". 

They recover the iPad and probably arrest some people (they stopped giving me details and taking my calls when they didn't need information from me that made them seem useful).

So I did the work of 4 detectives while working my normal job and had I been able to hire a different security agency, this halfwit police force would be out of work.

TL;DR Stuff got stolen, the internet worked better than 4 detectives and probably thousands of dollars of time and resources. I got my stuff back."	t5_2qorf	True

Hello /r/anarcho_capitalism, Lately on reddit I have seen many anarcho-capitalists and voluntarists participate in arguments with statists that were ultimately unproductive or downright damaging to spreading a positive image of our ideals.  What follows is a personal imploration for you and I mean absolutely no malice by any of its content and I apologize beforehand for any perceived offense by its tone.  It is not intended to be patronizing or offensive, but merely serve as a guide for participating in discussions on reddit (and the rest of the internet) and yielding the best results.
- The most important point I would like to get across is that when you are engaged in a discussion with another individual on reddit is that **your most important audience is everyone except the individual you are replying to**.  As a neutral party who is interested in a discussion of policy I have no strong opinions about, I am very unlikely to find agreement in the party that does not conduct his part in the discussion in a reasonable and respectful manner.  The person you are in the discussion with, most of the time, is going to defend to the end of the thread his opinions on the subject no matter what information you bring up, and if they’re frustrated, it will usually get ugly.  As such, you have zero interest in swaying their opinion – that they might appeal to reason by the end of it would merely be a nice bonus.  To the neutral party viewing the exchange, the side that resorts to personal attacks, snarky, disrespectful comments, or intellectual cowardice is not going to be convincing.  Often, both parties of a discussion reach this conclusion and neither side seems reasonable to a neutral party, not necessarily because of the content of the discussion, but how it was conducted.  Even if your debate opponent is hostile, illogical, and caustic, and you respond in a polite way in an open appeal to sensible discourse, **you will appear to be comfortable and confident in your position while your opponent will not, regardless of what content was brought up.** Swrdfshtrmbns, what are some ways in which I can be a sensible, helpful, and polite contributor on reddit and leave a positive impression on others about anarcho-capitalism?  I do not know the intimate intellectual histories of everyone here, but I think I can safely and accurately guess that at some point, the vast majority of you were statists of one stripe or another.  I know I was.  You know what characterizes a debate between typical statists?  A debate between statists is a violent, nonsensical discussion in which baseless assertions are paved over with emotional blackmail resulting in an extremely angry and emotionally charged group of participants who learn nothing, but it gets their blood pumping, which is the real victory for people of their condition.  So what is absolutely the worst way to engage a statist about an objection you have to something they bring up (and likely they brought up in what appears to them an innocent enough arena, not really looking “for a fight”)?    With a snarky, sarcastic one-liner filled with meaningless anarchist buzzwords.  I see this all the time here and elsewhere on reddit and it never seems to lead anywhere productive, but I guess anarcho-capitalists like their internet points too.  Think back to your time posturing politics on the internet before your anarchist enlightenment.  Do you think that kind of response would elicit an appropriate reply from you?  Probably not.  My guess is that you would have perceived them as “fighting words”.  Well, it’s time to stop doing that.  We’re grown-ass men and women of reason and one of the few positive comments people have to say about “those arachno capitalist guys” on reddit is that we’re kind of logical about things.  So let’s approach the common discussion on reddit in a logical way that will yield the best results:
- When you come across a post to which you would like to reply, either leave a simple, logical statement about your objection to the original content or polite inquiry to the poster as to why he holds his views, or to explain its benefits, etc.  You want to appear to be curious and hopefully develop a discussion in which the other contributor feels safe and respected.  Understand that this other person may not be looking for a debate.  After all, many of them do just jabber on in their herd and will get angry if actually challenged.  Do not pursue this kind of person.  Only continue with reasonable people.
- Define your terms!  There are a lot of complicated ideas and they are often expressed and perceived differently by many different types of people.  If you want to introduce an idea, explain what you mean by it when you say it (don’t be the “yeah I took Poli-Sci and read The Wealth of Nations, go look this shit up yourself” guy) the first time so there is no misunderstanding.  If the other person willfully ignores what you are defining your position as and gets hooked on the semantics in order to avoid discourse, you are dealing with someone who does not want to enter into a reasonable discussion.  Don’t think of a snarky dismissal, just end the conversation.  Most reasonable people actually do want to understand what you’re talking about.
- Understand what the other person wants to know about your position.  This may come as a shock to many of you guys, but there are plenty of cases of statists asking totally reasonable questions that I have seen you guys dismiss, berate, and counter with unrelated, unrequested information.  Did you interpret their incredulity to your initial response as disparagement?  Well guess what?  Boo fucking hoo, patience is a virtue, answer them kindly; it isn’t so easy being a revolutionary, is it?  What would you think if you were in their position?  Answer them to the best of your ability.  **What if I cannot answer their question?**  TELL THEM THAT.  Honesty goes a long way, and think of it this way: To be a casual statist and participate in debate, you don’t have to know much.  You just have to comprehend the content of your own brainwashing.  To be one of us, you have to know an extremely vast and extremely complex host of ideas that most of us would have never encountered without the internet.  No reasonable person expects you to know everything.  Here, I’ll even give you a freebie:

**“While I agree with the categorical imperative of the ability of market solutions to solve this problem, I do not know specifically how the objection you raised would be resolved.  If you are interested, I can point you towards resources that may answer your question and we can learn about it and discuss it further together.”**

Boom.  Fucking done.  It looks like you won without even making a point.  It has this rare quality that few discussions have on reddit: RESPECT FOR DISCOURSE.
- See what the real objection is of the person you are debating.  More times than not, people put up a false objection to protect themselves from having to confront their own discomfort about the issue, and when you go Murray Fucking Rottweiler on these red herrings, you look like an idiot.  Instead of going down that path – you would have to detect this maneuver first, I admit – pose this question:

**“For the sake of expediency in this discussion, if there was a way I could convince you that your objection is unfounded, or I was able to lay those fears to rest, would you still otherwise be opposed to my position?”**

They will have a hard time answering that.  If it is “Yes”, continue to the next objection, and you may be on the right track or you may have to rinse and repeat.  If it is “No”, then you may have a breakthrough in the discussion – keep at that objection!  If it is something like “I could never be convinced to agree with you, even if my objections were addressed”, end the discussion because this indicates that the person is not reasonable.
- Refrain from personal attacks.  Similarly, don’t hide behind accusations of personal attacks or intellectual bait-and-switches as an excuse to keep from responding from legitimate questions.  A lot of the claims of “HEY THAT’S A STRAW MAN” or “THAT’S A ___ FALLACY” are, in actuality, not really, or just vaguely so.  There are a lot of you who do not really know what these things are, but you use these terms anyway to escape responsibility.  Also, try not to respond to a personal attack by calling out a personal attack.  Guess what?  We all know it’s a personal attack, and sometimes the neutral parties quickly feel like watching children fight at the playground when this happens.  A much better response would be to take the high ground and respond to the questions – if there are any still around at that point.  The words will speak for themselves.
- We actually don’t know all the answers.  There are some things that are too esoteric in nature to speculate exactly on how they’ll work in a stateless society, seeing as how we have no concrete idea about the nature of how non-existing polycentric legal systems will arbitrate and organize.  Oh well.  You wouldn’t have been able to speculate a couple centuries ago on the current state of wireless, long distance communication and how that could be used to solve many problems, but it happened anyway.
- Do not come back to /r/anarcho_capitalism or /r/againstallarchons expecting the rest of us to bail you out of a terrible situation you created.  Notice how virtually nobody gets involved in train wrecks because nobody wants to be associated with a bad debate.  I am ruthless in my criticism of this kind of cowardice.  Grow up, apologize, and move on.  We’re not morons.  We can see when you instigate a shit-slinging match and then come back under the guise of “look at these idiots lol”."	t5_2qorf	True

Forget Ali - Frazier; ignore Santelli - Liesman; dismiss Yankees - Red Sox; never mind Silva - Sonnen; the new undisputed standard by which all showdowns will be judged happened in Spain over the weekend. During a debate on Europe's crisis, Pedro Schwartz (a mild-mannered Spanish 'Austrian' economics professor) took on the heavyweight Paul 'I coulda been a Fed Chair contender' Krugman, and - in our humble opinion - wiped the floor with his Keynesian philosophy. From the medicinal use of more debt to fix too much debt, to the Japanization of world economies and the demand-side bias of every- and any-thing - interested only in the short-term economic growth; the gentlemanly Spaniard notes, with regard to the European crisis, the fact that ""Keynesians got us into this mess and now we have to sacrifice our principals so that they can get us out of this mess"". Humble and generous in his praise - though definitively serious with his criticism - Schwartz opines: ""Often Nobel prize winners are tempted to pontificate on matters that are outside the specialty in which they have excelled,""noting ""the mantle of authority whereby what ever they say - whether sensible or not - is accepted with resignation from some and enthusiasm by others."" Krugman's red-faced anger is evident at the conclusion as he even refused to shake Schwartz's hand after the debate.
 
For 15 minutes of both education and entertainment - this is as good as it gets...
 
* Starting from around 35:00 the Spanish professor praises and criticizes in a thoughtful and gentle tone
* At around 39:00, he addresses the demand-side description of the world

1329136940.0	pnef8	Murray Rothbard and the eternal skeptic		84	16	15	"&gt;Around thirty years ago, as a young man, I attended a week long seminar that included Murray Rothbard as a lecturer. The seminar was intended for libertarians and those interested in austrian economics. The attendees were an amazingly diverse group and varied greatly in their understanding of the basics of both libertarianism and austrian economics. The evenings were devoted to casual open discussions that lasted until the wee hours of the morning. Ice chests full of beer were provided and the conversations were wonderfully lively. The discussion groups that Murray Rothbard attended proved to be the most interesting and entertaining, one of them finished up at a local Dennys (I think it was a Dennys) where we all had a very early breakfast, mostly because Murray insisted that he wanted food. The discussion never waned all night. That night Murray and another professor spent a great deal of time in a discussion with one particular young man. This young man had made somewhat of a nuisance of himself, he was a devout environmentalist and he believed firmly that any action, anywhere on the planet, that impacted the environment necessarily affected the entire eco-system, thus harming other people. He insisted that this justified any restriction of freedom necessary, because any damage (very very broadly defined) to the environment no matter how small, anywhere on the planet, constituted an assault on all other people on the planet. He once said that even a single molecule of pollution released into the air on the west coast of the US would harm people living on the east coast of the US.

&gt;This young man was eager to push his view and engaged many people in conversation, but unfortunately was so tied to his own views that even when individuals exposed the fallacies in his assumptions, or quoted reliable but contrary scientific evidence, or simply pointed out logical inconsistencies, he pushed on because it was still possible ‘somehow’ that a third party ‘somewhere’ would be harmed by even the smallest possible amount of ‘pollution’. When he was present it was impossible for any discussion of libertarianism or austrian economics to even get started. The talk always got bogged down on the question of whether it was possible for any individual to live their life without affecting the eco-system and his point that humans necessarily harm each other just by existing, so someone had to control peoples behavior. In his view all of libertarianism was false because we missed this basic point. He could not be dissuaded.

&gt;The night that we ended up at Dennys, Murray Rothbard and the other professor took it upon themselves to explain to this young man that he was playing the part of the ‘eternal skeptic’. They proceeded to tell a long involved story about a man driving a car with the ‘eternal skeptic’ as a passenger. The car stops running and the driver pulls over and says “we must be out of gas”, the ‘eternal skeptic’ replies “no, maybe something else is wrong”. The driver points to the gas gauge which reads empty and says “see, no gas”. The eternal skeptic says, “maybe the gauge is defective”. The story goes on and on in this vein and ends up with the empty gas tank removed from the car and split open with an axe. Yet still the eternal skeptic insists “maybe we just can’t see the gas because of the angle of the light or something”.

&gt;At this point Murray Rothbard and the other professor leaned forward and said to the young environmentalist “Do you know what the proper and logical response to the ‘eternal skeptic’ is at this point?” The young man said he didn’t know, at which point Murray Rothbard and the other professor said in unison **“fuck you”**. - T.

His [full speech here](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/07/13/remarks-president-campaign-event-roanoke-virginia).

&gt; So I’m going to reduce the deficit in a balanced way.  We’ve already made a trillion dollars’ worth of cuts.  We can make another trillion or trillion-two, and what we then do is ask for the wealthy to pay a little bit more. [...] There are a lot of wealthy, successful Americans who agree with me, because they want to give something back.

Because voluntary trade creates a mutual value surplus, the wealthy (at least the ones who got that way by facilitating voluntary trades) have already been 'giving back' to society, by leaving the people they traded with better off than they were before. In fact to the extent that this wealth was created through voluntary trade, and without depending on the coercion of the state, these wealthy people have already benefitted society _much more_ than have those who didn't become wealthy.

&gt; They know they didn’t -look, if you’ve been successful, you didn’t get there on your own.  You didn’t get there on your own.  I’m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart.  There are a lot of smart people out there.  It must be because I worked harder than everybody else.  Let me tell you something – there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.

&gt; If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help.  There was a great teacher somewhere in your life.  Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges.  If you’ve got a business. you didn’t build that.  Somebody else made that happen.  

Education, bridges, roads: Notice that these examples are all areas where government uses threats of violence to prevent or severely limit the emergence of private alternatives to the 'services' it provides.

It's true that we all benefit from one another. But we don't need coercive wealth transfer in order for this to happen.

&gt; The Internet didn’t get invented on its own.  Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.

The private sector was already heavily involved in research on getting computers to talk to each other. As I understand it, what the government did was to buy the rights to use a cluster of these ideas to use for military purposes--legally preventing others from developing them further (if anyone reading knows can confirm that this is/isn't accurate, please let me know). 

The US government bought the [ARPANET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET) project (the fledgling internet) for military purposes, and its research was directed in this direction too. The purpose of this intervention was certainly not so that (private) companies could 'make money off the internet'.

Whether or not the government invented the internet depends on how we interpret the words 'invented' and 'internet'--whose meanings can both be contested. What we can be much more confident about is the much less ambiguous claim that government involvement _severely delayed_ the arrival of the internet as we know it.

It did this by buying the rights to an idea, by crowding out private research in this field (hiring the best and the brightest from the voluntary sector), and by forbidding the use of the internet for commercial purposes until the early nineties. After that restriction was lifted its growth rate exploded, and the internet finally entered the life of the 'average joe'. More details on the history of the internet in [this wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet#Opening_the_network_to_commerce).

&gt; The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together. 

'Doing things together' in Obamaspeak, apparently means using coercive wealth redistribution. We shouldn't let these euphemisms bamboozle us: Voluntary cooperation is pro-social, coercion is _anti-social_.

&gt; There are some things, just like fighting fires, we don’t do on our own.  I mean, imagine if everybody had their own fire service.  That would be a hard way to organize fighting fires.

Trying to do things in isolation versus doing things on the basis of coercive wealth transfer is a false dichotomy. Genuinely 'working together' implies cooperating _voluntarily_, not a regime in which people hand over their resources to the state under the threat of violence for disobedience."	t5_2qorf	True

1334187613.0	s58g4	Left-wing scum here, with a hypothetical. Interested in opinions.	synthion	75	6	173	"Let's establish the setting, shall we? There is no government. Just people, and resources. Naturally free trade emerges and a market evolves. There is no government to establish a fiat currency, but as basic trading became unwieldly and inconvenient, a standard was established. Let's say, gold. (Not that it would be gold, but it's an easy example)

Soon, certain producers and traders become more prominent, and grow, and consume smaller competitors. Let's say, FoodCo., a food company, grows and grows until it holds a monopoly over the food market. MachineCo. goes through a similar process. Etc., Etc., until all markets are monopolistic in nature. Small businesses simply cannot compete, and the public simply wants cheap prices. They are not educated on economics, or what effect buying local has. How could they be?

So, the executives of FoodCo., MachineCo., ComputerCo., HollywoodCo., MedCo., and so on meet to discuss an exciting opportunity.

They will take large tracts of land and convert them into huge corporate lands, complete with housing for all employees.

They will cover most of the land with these facilities. All workers are required to move into these else they will lose their job. Naturally they all move in. They put the lower working class, laborers, common workers, into less cared for apartments and cheap townhomes. They don't like it? They lose their job. And the executives send their name and description to the other companies in the conglomerate so they know not to hire this person.

The more specialized workers get placed into higher luxury housing, and are told they are worth more than the common laborer.

The companies establish large, militarized security crews to protect themselves and their interests. They are treated very well, paid well, and live in lavish and luxury as long as they don't question their authorities and keep up with keeping any unhappiness in the workers down. Naturally they have zero interest in angering the higher ups.

Soon, since the conglomerate has all the industries covered, they can trade amongst themselves to get all essentials and establish company stores. (Remember those?) They start paying the laborers in Company Store credits instead of gold. They are more oppressed than ever, Naturally people get upset and start to riot, and strike. The rioters are killed, the strikers are fired, and replaced with desperate bums living in the slums that aren't within the facilities.

They still market their product to the ""middle class"", the more specialized workers, doctors, engineers, etc., keeping the market going.

This establishes a rigid caste system. No class mixing either. The middle class is educated to replace their parents. The Military class is trained to keep down resistance. The lower class is trained to not think, do as told, and live as machines. 

They use violence, torture, even religion to keep them in line.

The executives, which have become monarchs, for they pass down their positions to their children, also will not accept individualism. ESPECIALLY if it is counter-productive.

Some rules they laid out...

1. If you are hurt/sick to the point where you cannot work, you will be fired, expelled from the facility, and have your identity sent to all other sources of employment to prevent employment.

2. You must procreate. A women must bear 2 children in her ages 16-35. If she does not, she will be punished similarly. Any extra children will be aborted.

3. Homosexuals, Transgenders, or any other syndrome which prevents such procreation  will be punished similarly.

4. Any kind of rebellion is punishable by death, or torture until death.

Sounds terrible doesn't it?

The people in the slums of the outside cannot do anything because the conglomerate protects the resources by military force.

The environment deteriorates because the conglomerate has no interest for such trivial affairs.

1330194052.0	q5nsc	One less advocate for violence	reddituser780	86	17	52	"My roommate, when we moved in together 8 months ago, was a firm believer in market regulation, especially financial markets. No surprise, considering he has an accounting degree from a state school.

Well, I chipped away at those beliefs gradually with economic arguments, and he ceded over time that the regulations were burdensome and unnecessary.

I had argued very rationally for voluntarism, and he has recently come around to accepting my arguments, for the most part. He described himself to his friends the other night as ""social liberal, and fiscal conservative"", and that ""some healthcare and social safety net need government assistance"".

I simply said, ""I don't believe those programs help the poor or encourage better care. If I choose not to pay for these programs, will you support the men who come here with guns?""

Obviously he was taken aback. I'd made the argument from violence before, but I think that I reframed it when I pointed out that this is direct violence against ME. Also, those men would come to the place where WE live together.

He said from that perspective it is hard not to answer as an anarchist. It amazes me how when the doublespeak is stripped away, most ethical beings can see how clearly wrong taxation is.

I think framing the argument personally is key. The only reason government has power is because it has the sanction and manufactured consent of people. We outnumber them.

Government is a delusion. Just like religion is a delusion, words get twisted around to hide the inherent contradictions. Just as theology exploits language to allow intelligent people to believe absurd things, political and social rhetoric has deceived peaceful individuals into advocating violence against other peaceful individuals. My friend resisted voluntarism until, once the consequential arguments are stripped away, he found he could not in good conscience enforce his beliefs through the strong arm.

I remember this when I realized I was an anarchist. You reach a point where you can't maintain this fantasy in the face of reality, and you realize that the delusion clung to you way longer than it should have. Before that, the same thing happened with Christianity and god. You're not doing yourself any favors by denying what is true, no matter how uncomfortable.

The clergy is not the most deceptive or powerful charlatan we have to deal with. And we can see how well that struggle is going in /r/atheism.

The struggle for economic freedom, I think, will take a similar turn that atheism recently has. This is because, in the marketplace for ideas, we favor simple explanations with greater explanatory power. While this doesn't fully vindicate us, the urge to experiment with voluntary societies will become undeniable as the evidence mounts.

Anyway, we face a huge battle, and not one we should expect to win in our lifetime. The biggest difference you can make is in your immediately local circumstances. Living your life as a free individual is the best thing any of us can do.

And yesterday, the person THAT I LIVE WITH finally stopped advocating that I be robbed at gunpoint.

This is a person is very open-minded and it took about 8 months of talking economics and philosophy ALMOST EVERY DAY before he conceded that violence against innocent people is wrong. This is what we're up against folks."	t5_2qorf	True

WilliamII	83	16	106	"I'm a junior in university. Today in my political theory class we were assigned to create a government based on one of the theorists we've been studying (Aristotle, Plato, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Marx).

We *had* to choose a ""favorite"" and use their writings to create our ideal government. So we all split into groups by theorist. Myself and 3 others went with Locke (the smallest group by FAR); the largest groups were followers of Rousseau and Marx. Big fuckin' surprise.

I'm still a relative newcomer to this realm, but I figured I'd try and throw down some libertarian/AnCap ideas. *Why a government at all?* It went pretty well and I managed to sell my group-mates on the idea of no government! So we got to work drafting. Much of that time was just me answering their questions as best I could, but they seemed to be digging it.

We rooted AnCapistan in Locke by emphasizing consent of the people and free-markets. (It was a stretch because Locke is big on the legislature, but fuck that noise.)

The best part of today was when I told them they would have the freedom to do anything that doesn't violate anyone else's rights; that each man is his own sovereign. Their eyes lit up like, ""Yeah, that makes sense!""

Presentation time came and we laid out the basic ideas:

* No government or centralized power
* Private property-based
* Market anarchy
* Voluntary association
* Sovereignty over one's self

Most questions were easy and expected (thanks to all the awesome posts and links I've been reading here for the past 9ish months). Stuff like defense, dispute resolution, etc.

Then the Marxists presented. What follows is, at the very least, implied for their objectives but I had never been witness to people saying this in person.
It was never *real* to me before I looked at someone while they advocated killing or brainwashing opposition... That was a fuckin' trip.

They made it clear that their ultimate end is total global domination; all people **will** submit to their system. And if you don't cooperate? One girl said ""We'll probably have a 'Ministry of Love' or a 'shaming bureau' to deal with the uncooperative"".

They also enthusiastically advocated widespread use of ""indoctrination and propaganda"" to keep the ideology alive, lest someone in the future possibly object to the status quo.
I raised one question to them:

**""Aren't you concerned that once the state controls everything that it will not want to give it back? What if it decides that, 'Hey this absolute power thing is cool. Let's keep doing it.' and resources don't get redistributed as planned?""**

They told me: **""It can't happen, too many people will be involved in the transitional government for such a conspiracy to take hold. Also, the people in charge would be the revolutionaries so they wouldn't be interested in betraying the cause.""**


So yeah, I just figured I'd share today with yas. It was an awesome feeling to have people respond positively to libertarian ideas.

This place has been instrumental in my own growth and my ability to discuss and share with others. Stay awesome.

There's also debate coming up for the next class meeting titled ""considering political ideologies"". If you guys have any tips or jumping off points for debating commies/Marxists they would be appreciated."	t5_2qorf	True
1368886380.0	1ekrsm	Advocates of Nonviolence Must Oppose Gun Control	RyanPig	75	9	49	"A very common accusation lobbed against those who oppose gun control is that they are endorsing a culture of continued violence, but this is the opposite of what is the case: those who support gun control necessarily support the control of others' guns.  There are no pacifists in the anti-gun movement in this country, or in any other.  All gun control advocates support the ownership and centralization of guns, and the general means of force, by the State.  Every gun control advocate is a violence advocate, supporting proliferation of violence from the top down.


A pacifist might now object and claim that while the State's centralized control of violence is not justified, neither is the distributed means to violence among the people.  Such a person would be confused about the inherent maliciousness of monopolizing tools of violence.  In a world where the standard of self-defense is the gun, those who are disarmed are in a state of being perpetually aggressed against.  Even while this might not be the result of a conspiracy to breed obedient citizens, this is the end result.  People know they are out gunned by the State, and that is a reason many are obedient.  Arming yourself is therefore not an act of violence or a threat of it, but the end of violence that is constantly being committed against the unarmed. 


As Matt Zwolinski eloquently stated in an article about the Black Panthers' policing tactics in San Francisco, ""An armed policeman confronting a disarmed civilian is the picture of inequality."".  The Panthers' tactics should be of particular interest to those interested in non-violence.  What the Panthers did was not wage a war on police, but bring an end to the war by police against blacks.  Their wielding of firearms openly was anti-war statement if there ever was one.


The goal of the pacifist ought to be the end of all violence, where individuals operate not by force or the threat of it, but by means of discourse, agreement and cost-benefit analysis.  What I ultimately advocate is not an arms race of citizen against government, but an end to the sort of relationship that would result in the threat of violence always looming above the heads of the defenseless.  If you want to end violence in America, start by purchasing a gun.


The Left fancy themselves advocates of peace and equality.  IF this is true, let them repudiate the violence that makes gun control, and all government, possible.  They must begin supporting a society of radical individualism, where people are free to make choices without a Leviathan state capable of ending resistance whenever it likes.


With this in mind, let us throw our support behind the armed march into Washington D.C on July 4th not as a show of aggression, but as a display of peace and non-violence.  That one of the main concerns about this march is how the State could turn it bloody says far too much about the relationship between citizen and government.  This concern is little more than an act of violence itself.  May those on July 4th march for the end of all coercive relationships.  May it not only be free from violence, but be a powerful statement of nonviolence.

I was met by a fierce downvote drive in several threads. Both by /r/libertarian (which feared their reputations would be damaged) and by non-libertarians (quite possibly /r/EPS).

I was even cited the Reddit Code of Conduct (which I contend I did not break).

So what does this mean?

I must finally give in to the empirical approach when the evidence is so overwhelming: The only possible conclusion from all the data... is that Reddit has decided **to abandon democracy and one man one vote** and to instead **follow private contracts they've voluntarily signed with private entities**.

Rejoice, my friends! We're winning the battle! The Reddit community has finally seen that organizing votes for causes is wrong and they're ready to abide by the rules set forth by the private company to which they subscribe.

1339039950.0	up72x	My problems with Reddit thus far (joined this week)	ZommoZ	88	22	273	"I've always been wary of joining Reddit. I've heard it was a giant Liberal circle-jerk, where dissenting views are trampled on rather quickly, and any anti-statist views are pushed into the deepest corners, not to be seen by anyone who didn't already agree. But, last week, I started browsing. Mostly the front page, and just some random subredditing.

I came across r/Anarchism relatively quickly. Being an Ancap it seemed like a nice place to start. I was promptly greeted with a rather confusing front-page message about being anti-boss and anti-capitalism. To say the least, I was confused. I figured r/Anarchism would be more....open to everyone's beliefs. I figured that communists would have their own sub, as well and socialists and capitalists. But no, the main subreddit for Anarchism was specifically anti-me. Not off to a great start. I had always wondered why the left-anarchists were anti-capitalist, so I started a thread and asked. I was promptly attacked for my beliefs, and was downvoted instantly. Awesome start to my Reddit experience. Suggesting classic Ancap literature in the literature thread got instantly downvoted. So much for not downvoting beacuse you disagree with people's opinions.

I then found this subreddit, in the midst of some major drama. Downvote raids, pro-child abusers, rejecters of the NAP, etc. Interesting time to stumble in. Found a lot of intersting topics here and in r/Voluntarism. Then you guys got put in r/ShitRedditSays for something, where you guys were criticized for having a ""pretentious logo"" (As a man who's first book going down the rabbit hole was Rothbard's *For A New Liberty*, this hurts) and for being cold, heartless, and other things. This place is ridiculous. The least open-minded place on the internet that I've found thus far. As a frequenter of 4chan's /pol/ board, notoriously full of flaming and Stormfront douchebags, this was worse than anything I've ever come across.

Then, earlier today, I find a thread on the front page about a gay man who was fired from a private Christian school, for being gay. ""Oh!"" I thought, ""A perfect time to defend the NAP and my views!"" I spent a couple of hours refuting bad liberal logic, getting a lot of upvotes (over 100, not too shabby for my first real contribution on Reddit) and swaying a couple of peoples' opinions it seemed. Then came r/ShitRedditSays. My contributions are currently #1 on that subreddit, with -97 or so. I have been Karma raided, going from +100 to -81 in a matter of hours. The subreddit prides itself on circle-jerking apparently, so when I posted in my own hate-thread, I was promptly banned. Fantastic! Then the raid came, as well as more hate in the original thread. Never before have I seen so many hateful people. Calling me a bigot, a racist, homophobe, and sexist...all because I accept the rights of people to act that way, while openly rejecting the actions taken by people those words would fit appropriately. So much ignorance, so much hatred. All because I'm tolerant of non-violent behavior.

I really don't know what to think. Is it a losing battle to try and spread the message or freedom and liberty on here?

Is the AnCap ideal not a society where all interactions are voluntary? In other words, doesn't the word voluntarism have the same meaning as anarchocapitalism without all the baggage of either word? The best thing is, people who oppose voluntarism immediately have to justify their use of force, because the focus on whether interactions are coerced or not is embedded right into the name.

* voluntarism (or voluntaryism) is a more inclusive term, including both anarcho-capitalists and traditional anarchists who, despite disagreeing on their definitions of how property should be allocated, believe such an arrangement should be a voluntary one for all those involved. In that way, voluntarism may be a bridge-point between these two philosophies.

* voluntarism emphasizes agorism rather than wholesale dismantling of the state, making it more palatable to most people.

* the root-word of ""voluntary"" has very wide appeal, even to those who believe the state should exist."	t5_2qorf	True

1370896532.0	1g2huv	What if? The NSA scandal if it occurred in an alternate AnCap society	aducknamedjoe	81	17	36	"The anchor of Agora News Online brushes a stray lock of hair from her face as the 'News Alert Update' logo fades from the screen.  

She begins, ""Shares of N.S.A. Co. plunged Friday when whistleblower Ed Snowden came forward with revelations of a widespread spying campaign perpetuated by the DRO against its own subscribers, and against the subscribers of other DROs.""

The picture flashes to a shot of the N.S.A company headquarters in Virginia, besieged by news drones and new media journalists with over-sized telephoto lenses.  Guards at the gate are trying unsuccessfully to prevent videos from being taken.  As the picture zooms in it is clear several have already abandoned their posts and one can be seen holding a sign that reads ""N.S.A.=Liars...I quit!""

The anchor continues, ""Already 10 of the biggest 12 security firms in the area have declared they will no longer honor contracts with N.S.A. Co. and are offering generous discounts for any current N.S.A. subscribers looking to switch providers.  According to Consumer Reports, thousands are doing just that, and economic analysis firms are predicting N.S.A. Co. has lost 30% of its subscriber base in just the last week.""

The program cuts to a distinguished looking man with white hair, standing on the steps outside a large marble building, the text underneath identifies him as ""Hans Hoppe, Chief Adjudicator, Supreme Arbitration Co.""

He speaks, ""I can confirm that our organization is working on several cases brought by subscribers and other DROs against N.S.A. Co.  Rest assured, we will live up to our reputation in administering fair and impartial justice and ensure that those harmed will receive compensation if it is warranted.""

The camera cuts back to the anchor, who adds, ""Legal analysis firms and online betting markets expect N.S.A. Co. to be required to pay out hundreds of millions in compensation claims to subscribers and competitors should Snowden's accusations hold up in court.  Already Company officials have been reportedly contacting local auction houses in preparation for the sale of assets, and stock exchange companies warn the firm could be out of business by the end of the month.""

She smiles, ""An unsubstantiated report has also surfaced that Ed Snowden, backed now by investor and crowd-funding money, is looking to purchase the assets of N.S.A. Co. for his own DRO start-up: Transparent Security Co.  According to the source, he promises not to re-hire anyone involved in the scandal."""	t5_2qorf	True

I think it is actually the key point in the argument against IP. I think it illustrates that [rivalry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_\(economics\)) is necessary for property rights to take effect/be necessary.

EVERYBODY is forced to pay for this one sole radio station to exist. Every four years the public are encouraged to vote on the stations playlist.. they don't vote for individual songs though.. no! The government DJ's offer up two slightly different playlists to choose from, one has a little more Pop, the other has a little more Rock.


Fans of the more obscure music genres don't like either of the options but are still pushed to participate. The wealthy and politically connected can influence the playlist and get songs they'd like into the mix. The common man gets what he's given and is told he should be grateful!


When the votes are tallied, EVERYONE has to endure the playlist for 4 dissapointing years. Half of the songs on the playlist never even get played! (""the music budget fell a little shorter than the government DJ's expected..""). But fear not! In 4 years time, you can expect a bigger and better playlist to be promised.. but you know it will never be delivered.

If you refuse to pay for the radio station - you go to jail! If you attempt to broadcast your own station - you go to Jail. And no one wants to hear anyone complaining about the songs either, after all, the nation voted for them! If you don't like it, leave!


The vast majority of the listeners somehow believe that allowing just ""anyone"" to broadcast a radio station would be.. Anarchy! Chaos even! Just imagine the big business corporations that would fill the airwaves with advertisments of their material products! They would enslave the minds of the masses! Imagine the poisonous music kids could have access to.. please think of the children!! So NO! We need ONE station.. The Peoples Democratic Government Station!

There are saber-toothed tigers outside; they are called transnational corporations which are among the most tyrannical totalitarian institutions that human society has devised.

The cage is protecting people from predatory tyrannies so there is a temporary need to maintain the cage, and even to extend the cage.

So, I've been reading a good many books about personal finance lately (Dave Ramsey's *Complete Guide to Money* and *Total Money Makeover*, Dr. Thomas Stanley's *The Millionaire Mind*), and I've started making some plans for myself.  Get a decent job with decent, average-ish income ($20/hr), invest most of that income in mutual funds that have good five year track records, and hopefully be financially set in ten years, and a millionaire in twenty.  Having graduated college without any debt and gotten myself a nice vasectomy to avoid any sudden children-related expenses, this should be plenty feasible.

I have a [spreadsheet](http://imgur.com/DKCL48q) and everything, and according to that spreadsheet, if I can maintain a decent income ($40K/yr) and investments (12% interest) from that income for thirty to forty years, I can [buy a personal cruise ship](http://cruiseship.homestead.com/cruiseships.html) and maybe sell spaces on it as condos, apartments, or something towards other liberty-minded folks.  Sort of like seasteading, but with less reliance on yet-to-be-developed technology.  This is a few decades off, yet, so details can wait.

First, though, I need to learn a skill and get a decent job.  And that'll take a while, and that while currently involves being distracted by shiny Internets.  Which brings me here: I was wondering what all the good people of /r/Anarcho_Capitalism were planning to do to acquire personal wealth, and if and how they were thinking to use that to advance the cause.

1364317185.0	1b1u0t	Some questions from a random interested person.	ShieldAre	68	7	86	"Hello! First of all, I'd like to apologize for not taking a deep look into the links to the right.

Some time ago, I had a discussion with a person who supported anarchocapitalism. He made several arguments against the government, and I disagree with many of them, but also found his arguments quite intersting. I asked some questions from him, but I feel that he didn't sufficently answer them, so I thought I'd come to see if someone could answer them.

Yes, I support the notion that societies should be ruled by governments, and by some books that would make me a ""statist"". However, I am genuinely intersted in the subject and I hope that you will not be too harsh on me.

So here goes:

* How would an anarchist society handle law? Who decides what are the laws of the society, who decides about the punishment for them, who detains criminals? And who pays for this all?

For example: A man gets murdered. Who will investigate his death? Obviously, we can't just let the murderer go free, can we? There has to be someone who investigates the murder, gathers evidence, finds suspects, and finally the murderer has to be punished if found guily. The question: Who is this investigator, how is the punishment decided? Who pays for all this? For example, certain equipment may be needed to analyze the evidence. A forensic labotarory.

I have heard suggestions about a private security company taking this job. However, even in that case, someone has to pay for all this. What if the victim is poor, unable to pay for the investigation (or in the case of a murderer, he/she is dead)? And even if the security company can do this job, there has to be a way to decide if the suspect is guilty and if yes, what the punishment should be.

Another possibility could be a local militia or something similiar. But that has its problems too.

* How is copyright upheld? I think that our current copyright systems are not very good, but there has to be a copyright system of some kind. Without copyright, you could write a book, and then someone might steal it and sell it as their own. Effectively this could mean that authors would not profit (enough) from their book, leading to less books and thus less culture, which in my opinion would be a very bad thing. Same applies to things like music and movies etc.

* How about currently public institutions? Would there be libraries? If yes, who would pay for their upkeep? Or would these be free libraries, where you are free to borrow books and maybe even take them to yourself permanently if you want? 
How about museums? Works of art? Would those be owned by private corporations? How about art forms that might not be able to fund themselves?

* How about records? How would you prove that you own a piece of land? Lets say that you buy a piece of land. That piece of land happens to be a few hundred kms away from your home. What if when you arrive there, someone has taken the land? Could you sue? Who would prove that the paper that says that you own the land is legitimate? Who would care about a silly piece of paper anyway?

* What about social inequality? If you happen to be wealthly (lets say your parents were rich) you can more easily afford to have high quality education and healthcare, which means that you will probably get a good job, and if you want to start a business, it is much easier, thanks to the wealth.

If you however happen to be poor, you can't afford a good education, and you can't afford good healthcare. This in turn means that you are unlikely to get a good job, and if you want to start a business, it is much harder, and you will probably have to get a loan.

Would poor and unlucky people have to live on charity?

Also, who would take care of the sick, and mentally ill people? How about old people who don't have enough pensions? Or disabled people?

* Defense. Assuming that not all societies have abandoned the government, how would the anarchist society defend itself against an attacker? The society would have to be organized enough to form a reasonable defense, there would probably have to be a hierarchy in the military, and someone would have to pay for all the military equipment. Tanks and fighter jets etc. are not cheap, and maintanance costs a lot.

* Environmental protection and other regulation. You can't have a company dumping its toxic waste wherever it wants. How do you regulate these? Also, how do you regulate what substances are allowed in food, for example? Who makes sure that the regulations are followed?

* Scientific research. Someone has to pay to the scientists for the job they do. Not all research has immediate economical benefit, some research never will. Research is crucial for developement. How would you gather the money for building a large project such as the LHC? Would science be dependent on donations?

* Public property. Ah yes, it is the good old ""roads and bridges"" argument. I saw this picture: http://imgur.com/T3BUS but I feel like it misses the complexity. Who pays for the building of the roads? Who owns them? Who decides how they are used? I mean, if a company pays for the construction of a road, will it not demand payment from people for using it? And wouldn't this mean that they could place very high tolls on the use of those roads? Same goes to private citizens working as the owners. So would the roads be owned by the society? And how would the payment for it be organized?

I think this is enough for now. I apologize for making such a long post, and I might have misunderstood some fundamental parts of anarchocapitalism, but I am interested in hearing your responses.

Edit: Oh wait, some more questions: What stops a powerful enough person from gathering a following and imposing his or her own rules on the society? What stops someone rising to a local warlord, who uses violence to grab your posessions and dismiss your rights? They could also use political or religious ideology to drive this power grab.

Also: What stops the government from being born again? Left to their own, humans tend to naturally to start forming primitive governments, which may by time expand larger, and in the end a government is born again.

Finally, how would you start this anarchist society? First you would have to get rid of the government, which isn't too easy, unless you have an overwhelming majority of people that support not having a government.

Edit2: Thank you for all the responses! :) I didn't expect this subreddit to be this active. Apparently there are more anarcho-capitalists than I expected. I will try to take time to read through all your responses."	t5_2qorf	True

EndTimer	76	15	36	"OK, help me out here.  I want to understand capitalism from base principals.  ~~By what natural right does one claim property?~~  We own things by having the most justifiable claim to them, by reshaping them and working on them, and it is, I think, objectionable to work or change something someone else has already made theirs, unless they abandon it.  ~~Right now, I know, it's because we pay for it and have presumably done some service that justifies it, but the system is already in place.  The companies already have billions, the property deeds have already been doled out, and ownership is entrenched.~~  I want to understand this from the very basics.  So:

Suppose that tomorrow, out of nowhere, we can travel to other planets and bring arbitrarily large amounts of hardware with us to mine/build upon/exploit these planets.  ~~I know this is unrealistic but my question is who, and by what natural right, do they lay claim to anything out there?~~  Not to sound petty, but first come, first serve.  In an ideal, prosperous civilization, people would work to be granted someone else's property, or else make use of abandoned property, or else go and find their own.  ~~With property in the United States, the government claimed right to it first~~, by no right except the permissiveness of the people ... mistakes were made, but we've never been perfect ~~then sold it, then protected what they sold.  Obviously, the US government cannot control space.  So what if I claim a whole planet?  What if I claim just the area my factory sits on?  What if my competitor takes over the resources I claimed out of the blue?  Why can I not claim the whole universe apart from the Earth as mine right now?~~  They can't, everyone would laugh at this just as they would today, and make use of these resources as they were able.

~~The whole concept of ""property"" seems very flimsy to me.~~  *It seems very difficult to enforce, because on one hand, I am being answered that the state and its powerful courts could not exist, and on the other, that people would not give up their lives for companies under an anacap civilization, putting an absolute ceiling on retribution or ability to stop someone else from simply taking a resource out from under you as best they could and two parties basically resigned to calling each other assholes and trying to get public opinion on their side.*   It ~~ironically, despite your protests~~, virtually REQUIRES government enforcement *for maximum efficiency*, otherwise larger companies with greater resources could destroy their competition however they liked, *though not resorting to murder, destruction*.  ~~They could collude into price fixing~~. If any non-monopoly remains, though, they can profit massively by undercutting the status quo.  *I do still worry that hyper-powerful companies without oversight and regulation could abuse the general population once they have the money to afford ""armies"" and ""protection"" not beholden to any law but the promise of wealth.

~~I agree with you right now that the government is the greater evil, as they act with whole righteous authority to take what they want, arrest who they want, kill who they wants, war with who they want, grant monopolies to the businesses they want, subsidize them (whether they're good ""investments"" or not).  Businesses do not have this kind of power, but in an anacap system they would have even more power, being the only means of production of goods and able to afford violence, coercion, protection, etc.~~  The snarky answer was on the money, here:  if we can break our government of its terrible holds on us, we shouldn't be subservient to companies that emulate it, either.

So work me through the first principles, the right to claim anything as solely your own.

It is a basic economic fact that equilibrium price rises if demand increases and supply decreases, and that was exactly what happened to gasoline: more people wanted gas for heat and electricity because it was the closest substitute to the electrical infrastructure that was heavily damaged by the weather, and gasoline was more scarce because supply chains were broken, so gasoline was scarcer and dearer. But Chris Christie decided to freeze prices, so prices could not reach equilibrium. What resulted was shortages.

[It was Happening](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/424/056/fd3.jpg) in New Jersey over the last week. Gasoline suppliers closed down because there was no more gasoline left, and the police guarded the gas stations that were still operational because fights were breaking out due to the shortages. A friend of mine told me about lines that were three miles long to get fuel for generators and heating. My mom told me that someone was recently beat up by the police and arrested just for following a fuel truck so that he could know where he could get gas: apparently, the police have a claim on all oil in New Jersey. All of this happened because of a shortage, which would have been better dealt with by the market if prices were simply allowed to clear.

During the 1973 oil crisis, Nixon decided to freeze oil prices, and the result was generally the same, except on a global scale since oil is priced in American dollars: massive shortages. Alaskans froze to death because there was no oil left. When there is none of a good or service left, the price does not matter. Governments cannot control prices without controlling people's lives."	t5_2qorf	True

This morning, with the SCOTUS decision on Obamacare, I came to the conclusion that any state, no matter how limited by its constitution, will eventually transform itself into despotism.

I decided to publicly state that point of view with my facebook status today:  *So the mandate is unconstitutional... unless they call it a tax? Never underestimate the ability of the federal government to use hollow semantics to deprive us of every last bit of personal liberty.*

*The only solution is to repeal the 16th Amendment, amend the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause, and overturn all SCOTUS cases like Wickard v. Filburn and Gonzales v. Raich. Until such a time as those things happen, I have officially lost all hope in the existence of a central government that will not eventually devolve into absolute tyranny.*

1352996047.0	138tbm	Something occurred to me while discussing anarchy w/ /r/Christianity	hexapus	81	23	217	"I know many are atheists here, but still many others are Christian...I just thought I'd share something that occurred to me in a discussion over on /r/Christianity

http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/137lsw/arminianism/c71s9hy?context=3

On a related note, if you're a Christian and an AnCap, please be active over in that sub...get into thought-provoking discussion.  There are a lot of people whose allegiance is not primarily to the state, and if you can offer compelling evidence Jesus lived out this philosophy, they would be willing to shift their political views to be compatible with their spiritual ones.

Edit:  I just want to say I'm a lot happier with the conversation and the number of comments this has provoked than any upvotes.  I love good discussion."	t5_2qorf	True

1345310689.0	yfnum	"""I used to be an AnCap, but now I'm __________."" "	monkfishliver	67	6	597	"I am currently an AnCap. 

I was raised a statist liberal, then gravitated towards the republican- right around the time of the Gore/Bush campaign. An interest in the Austrian school led me to question the efficiency of govt, but the more I read, (exposure to the NAP?) I see the State less as a bumbling bureaucracy and more of a relentlessly destructive parasite.  Now I tend to filter everything (in the news, for example) via an individualist lens.

But in every step of my journey I've felt comfortable with the prevailing paradigm I build for myself, and then something will come along and burst the bubble.  Based on my track record, I see no reason why at some point in the future I will not move on to something else, or incorporate other philosophies.

I've lurked a bit in this sub, and while I don't recall names, I recall there were a few here that seemed on board, but then 'changed' and started violently disparaging ancap ideas.   I've wondered why, if one were to move on from ancap, one wouldn't choose to come back here with a supportive hand instead of a vitriolic tongue.

I guess I'm asking - not what brought you here, we all have those stories... I'm asking, for those subscribers who have ideologically ""moved on"" from AnCap, what do you now follow and why?  What was your paradigm shift?  Is there still another 'red pill' to take?  What came along to tip the scales?  Was there something in Ancapism you just couldn't reconcile? (I'm not strong on the whole origin of property thing for example).  

Like Daffyd Thomas, I'm comfortable being an ancap as long as I'm surrounded by statists, lol.
