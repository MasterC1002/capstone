1369294769.0	1ew489	Bank teller's harsh reaction to D&amp;D...actually my bad.	tenth	76	17	9	"Short-n-sweet: Moved to a new part of town a few months ago. New area means new banking location. I don't like exploring the new area--unfamiliar, easily turned around, don't know the backroads, etc.
So the last few months I've only been going to the bank when absolutely necessary--which, between my card and my checkbook, is rarely.
But once a month on D&amp;D night I will always stop by the bank and pick up cash for the food/snacks we go in on as a group each session. Our DM is a stickler for time, so it usually feels like the fastest method of getting cash for the snack-pot when I'm (almost always) running late.
Last week I stop by the bank on the way and my girlfriend, who usually sits in the car, came in with me. While I'm waiting on the clerk to hand me the cash GF mentions not running redlights on the way, because she knows I get anxious about being fussed at. Clerk, who I've transacted through maybe twice before this, gets an perplexed look with a bitchy eyebrow raise and looks at GF stating, ""You go with him?"" Girlfriend, proud to put up with her dorky boyfriend, cutely retorts, ""Hey, it's not my thing, but I'm supportive. Personally I think it's kinda weird and creepy sometimes, but he's been doing it since he was 12 so I doubt he'll give it up any time soon."" Clerk looks aghast and finishes handing us the money, blushing the whole time and barely looking at us, doesn't say another word.

Thought it was weird, got upset. Only five minutes later, getting aggravated with gf about it, talking about how this clerk barely knew me did I realize that one of my first times in the new bank when the clerk joked about me seeming in a hurry that I had said something to the effect of ""I feel like the workweek beats you down, I know I'm always ready for a release. Besides, my Dungeon Master is always pissed if I'm late."" 

Dear god. I was getting angry-as-hell at this poor woman who probably thinks my girlfriend is driving me to get my dick sucked in a gimp outfit. Sexy.

1362876370.0	19zyvy	Played D&amp;D for the first time last night. I was DM. I'm addicted and terrified.	jwgibbo	44	2	26	"Last night, I hosted my first D&amp;D game.  It was with a group of late 20-somethings, all raised in gaming though most had never played D&amp;D.  I used the red box for D&amp;D 4E. Stopping at, literally, every step to explain the rules drew the game out long.  When I say long, something comes to your mind. Wrong! That is not long enough.  Longer!  But, everyone got to improvise as much as they wanted.  The mechanics started to make sense.  I dare say there was the faintest soup√ßon of role playing. Mostly akin to ""then I backstab that fucking goblin"" but I assure you it was in character.  

I'm hooked. 

Now, for the terrifying part.  I get online to investigate just how vast this brand new *universe* is.  It is intimidating to say the least.  Jerry Holkins (aka Tycho from Penny Arcade) said it best, ""[D&amp;D] is a game that tricks people into doing research.""  As a current PhD student, I can confirm this.  Today, I was looking at the sheer volume of text that encapsulates just portions of what is possible, and as DM I feel responsible to have a thorough understanding of it all.  ""It all"" seems modest.  Before the libraries of moves, monsters, locations, spells, items, and rules, there are the axiom like mechanics that need to be understood before a character can even come to be.

Roll on.

1371642234.0	1gneag	Hilarious in hindsight...	Aetis	49	12	3	"The game started fairly normally.

Our party, which included a wizard, Rogue/Assassin, Artificer, and a Abjurant Champion (I think?), ran into some fiendish wolves chasing down a tiefling girl. We fight them off, and eventually kill the demon lord wolf who is their leader. We cut his head off and pack him up hoping to sell his hide for good price in town.

Fast forward a bit, we, including the tiefing girl, were resting in an inn, with our rogue/assassin keeping watch from a rooftop of a building across the road. Some guy climbs on to the rooftop next to our rogue, so our rogue stops him and decides to chat with him for a bit. He learned that someone paid the dude (he was a duskblade) gold to kill the girl and bring back her head. After bit of diplomacy and bribery, we convinced him to dupe his employer with a fake head. We disguised the wolf head (we still had it with us) with makeup &amp; illusions and sent him on his merry way.

At this point, our DM starts to crack up. We ask him what's up but he told us to keep going, and that's what we did. Eventually, we ran into the final boss room where we find a high-level cleric, the demon lord wolf again, the duskblade, and non-functioning shadesteel golem. We were confused because the cleric had mostly defense and stall spells prepared, and we were high enough level that the demon wolf wasn't much of a threat any more. The golem became functional after the cleric died, but we ganged up on it and took it down. tl dr: easy final boss.

At this point our DM, who looked conflicted and trying not to laugh for the past two hours, finally spills the beans. Turns out the cleric needed tiefling souls to activate the golem, which was why he was sending minions to hunt the tiefling girl down. Apparently his plan was to cast resurrection on the girl's head to bring her back, then kill her with a special sword that can suck out souls. Imagine his surprise when he cast resurrection on the head, only to find his worthless wolf back instead of the girl. Also, the spells he prepared for that day made more sense if the golem had been active.

So we ruined the final boss's plans by sheer accident. It was a good day."	t5_2qwdo	True

1348214172.0	108mtz	Tim the Rogue.	akigo57	42	8	4	"Several months ago I had the opportunity to partake in a game of Dungeons and Dragons, 3.5.

The game itself started out normally, with a fairly interesting hook (something about joining forces with our fellow PCs to combat a major evil that was planning to enslave our respective races and take control of our plane of existence), and a rather interesting assortment of characters.

There was Arihoni the Human Wizard, DomDom the Half-Orc Fighter, Sven the Cleric, and myself, Art the Halfling Bard.

The game progressed nicely, we killed some bad guys, saved some good guys, and delighted in the comfort of legions of barmaids.

After a few weeks of play we were sure that we had attracted the attention of our BBEG (Big Bad Evil Guy), mostly because there was at least three failed assassination attempts on our lives.  Thankfully we managed to kill or avoid our potential murderers and decided that we should probably seek out some assistence.

After much debate our party decided that we would set our sights on the major city of the kingdom that we were in. It was there that the King of the land lived, and we felt convinced that we would be able aquire his aid in the upcoming epic battle with BBEG. So we prepared for our long trip the only way you truely can. We sent the Cleric to buy supplies and the rest of us got drunk at the local mead hall.

During the next session, we started our long journey and about half way into the day's game we stumbled into a little joke of a town called Karith Moraz. A quiet little place, nestled in the shadow of a large mountain range. It had about 8 buildings at least two of which were recently on fire it seemed.

We wandered into the inn for food and rest...

I should pause here and explain that at this point in the game we had a new player in the group. We had played for about 2 hours before finally meeting his character.

Once inside the inn, we got food, cheap dwarven beer, and had a seat while discussing our next move. Art, being the good bard that he was, took it upon himself to search out anything interesting as far as gossip goes in this town. What luck! It turns out that there was a recent influx of Gnolls that had been ambushing travelers on the road... Their was a fair number of them and since there was no guard to speak of here, they had been stealing and stashing for months.

The resulting conversation with my party must have caught the ear of a nearby half-elf. The figure walked over to us boldly and introduced himself as Tim, Tim the rogue. He informed us that he had been observing the comings and goings in town and had decided that he would very much so like to liberate all that the gnolls had worked so hard to steal. He proposed that as a highly skilled rogue, he assist us in dealing with this threat. We agreed, partially because we needed a rogue, and partially because this was obviously the PC we had been waiting to meet all day.

Moving on... Tim was in a word, delightful. He was by no means a combat rogue, in fact he sucked. He was however, highly skilled in everything else. Every ounce of anything was dumped into skills and abilities that Tim found useful. He could pick a lock faster than the fighter could cut off a kobold's head, but that's not what made all of us fall in love with him.

Tim was RP heaven. Any chance he got, if there was a chest, door, or any other 'trapped' something Tim would demand that all the other characters turn away while he did away worked his magic even if there wasn't a trap. Obviously taken from an unmentioned source. Beyond that though, he would run slight of hand checks to pocket extra coin from a chest. He would sweet talk anyone he could for that little something extra, and with all the skills to back him up he usually didn't fail. The most interesting thing though, Tim would pay huge sums of money to random Bards to sing praises of him. After a few weeks of heroic travels and wanderings we started to hear songs and myths of ""Tim the Savior"", ""Tim the Hero"", ""Mighty Tim"" and so forth. By the time we actually got to the major city, Tim was a legend.

We wandered about the city for a few days. We aided the locals with some of their issues. I am pretty sure we had to collect bottles at one point (Nods at the DM). We finally did get around to trying to talk to the King. We made our way to the grand castle. Tim politely excused himself, claiming he had to run an errand and would catch up with us. He disappeared into the croud.

We spoke with the guards of the castle and after jumping through a few hoops, we managed to get an audience with the king. We walked into the main hall where the king was sitting and to our surprise... Tim was there, chatting with the king. We didn't think too much of it and walked forward boldly and with intent. About halfway into the hall we were surrounded by guards.

""Yes my lord! Those men there, they are the assassins I have been tracking for weeks! They are here to kill you under authority of your brother, and have used lies to seek audience with you!""

We were confused, more importantly, we were restrained.

The king stood and walked forward slowly. He let out a long sigh. ""So, this is the best that that my brother could send to kill me? With such a weak lie to get past my guards."" I dare say it may have worked if it had not been for the the Great Tim here. I have heard many tales of this hero.""

We protested, but Tim's skills bested us at every turn and the king didn't believe us. So we did what we should probably not have done. We tried to fight our way out of there. It didn't work we were restrained, and imprisoned.

Later in the evening while sitting in our cell a familiar face walked over to our cage. 

It was Tim. ""Well I must say, this went exactly as I had planned."" His voice and stance was 100% different.

We screamed, we argued, we tossed around insults.

""To be honest when I took this job I knew I wouldn't be able to kill you myself. I am not particularly good at killing others in the conventional way. So I figured I would let someone else do it for me.""

The last thing we heard of Tim was him laughing as he walked out of the dungeon.

The next day our characters were dragged out of their cells, and we sat back as they were all beheaded for conspiracy to assassinate a member of the royal family.

We swore that we would never speak of what happened during those sessions, but I break that oath now. So be warned, the BBEG is not always the greatest threat."	t5_2qwdo	True

I *know* my youngest, who is 6, will want to play, but I also know she will get bored easily and want to wander off from the table, or not play at all, on an unpredictable basis. 

This presents a minor challenge.  I need to come up with a character that she can play, and will have fun with, but will not necessarily provide an integral part of the party's capabilities and can have a reasonable explanation for being absent at frequent, random times.  Has anyone here done anything similar?

EDIT: Lots of good ideas in this thread... thanks for all of them.  After reading through all of this I'm starting to think that maybe her character is the subject of a botched enchantment that turns her into a small figurine of herself much of the time.  She can regain her original form some of the time, but spends about half her time in statuette form.  The other characters carry her with them when she's the statue."	t5_2qwdo	True
1365073801.0	1bnjqw	I know it's not for everyone... but help me create Unlockable Achievements for my Campaign?	houseau	40	9	11	"**TL;DR** - I'm writing achievements for our Secondary Campaign, wanna help?

When we can't run our usual Campaign for whatever reason, I've volunteered to run something of a Comic Relief Campaign which was inspired by a post *somewhere* on reddit suggesting everyone plays as totally expendable Goblins who have been conscripts into a huge army. 

Essentially their goal is to abandon their posts as they know that as bad as the survivability rate for a Goblin marching with Hill Giants, Trolls, Gnolls and other such nasties, it will drop much lower if they are still around when they clash with the forces of the Great and the Good. Every time a PC Goblin gets killed, the PC gets a new one right off the assembly line. If the PC Goblin manages to escape, he's still replaced by fresh meat, but this time the Goblin is a bit better than before. The players are well aware that their goblins are likely to die over and over again, hopefully hilariously.

I've stolen a bunch of ideas that my Google-fu has uncovered, but there's always room for more. Some examples that I've already created can be found [here](http://imgur.com/a/GTiNe), or alternatively I've got a text-based list below. As you can see I'm toying with the idea of some (or all) achievements giving some sort of a boon to the players. Many of these achievements will be nigh on impossible for our tiny, ugly protagonists, whilst others might be achievable by accident.

As this campaign is essentially Filler for my group, I don't have to worry about being Serious, or accidentally overpowering a character with a boon etc. I'm hoping it might even work as an ""escape valve"" for us to be stupid, so when we're playing the regular campaign we can focus on more serious roleplaying.

Now i allow different races and classes but this has gone too far, he has changed feats and abilities to make his character neigh unstoppable (I don't blame him for that) But has made it very hard for me as a DM to do anything to him, (Example; when you go to attack him, you get a -2 to attack, because it demoralizes the attacker) and he uses his powers/feats so well that nothing can touch him. He is Level 2, and has played a LOT of D&amp;D, so i understand where he is coming from, and yes i made the mistake of approving a psionic  class. My question is this, should i neuter him ( like make a trap designed for him that takes away his psionic powers)make a mission built for him, and make his character revert back into its original form, or just try to combat him?

http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Decanter_of_Endless_Water

I found this item in a list of useful items.  Someone said it had many uses, including as a propulsion device for a small boat! Of course, as an engineer, I had to figure out exactly how well it would perform at this function.

So, that geyser ability. So great right?! 20 foot stream! 30 gallons per round! Strength check to avoid knockdown! Wow! Except the designer of this item has zero concept of physics. When I first thought about it, I said, that sounds like a lot, but it's the equivalent of flipping over a 5-gallon bucket of water (5 gallons per second). Not very impressive. In fact, in this mode, water is expelled at the extreme rate of 0.6 miles per hour! Wow! Er, yeah, it sucks. Not sure how a 20 foot long stream comes out at half a mile per hour, but there you have it. DC 12 STR check to withstand that whopping 1 pound of force.

Now, how does this amazing device act as a propulsion device? Not very well either. Assuming a row boat (100 pounds, 10ft long) and two light passengers plus gear (400 pounds), which is rowed at 1.50 miles per hour, adding the decanter at geyser level lets you go 1.51 mph! Astounding. If you get lazy and let it push you without rowing? 0.17 mph. You would do better with the fountain level. Assuming the neck of the flask is 1 inch in diameter, that would net you 1.54 mph max, and double the velocity without rowing.

However, there is potential for this item. It pushes out a lot of water, you just need to make it into a jet with a nozzle. If you funnel that geyser level of water down to an inch, water will shoot out at 83 miles per hour! Now we're talking! The strength check makes sense in this case, as you will have to withstand ~160 pounds of force. As a motor, is it a lot better, letting you to 2.5 mph max, or 2 mph if you're lazy.

Go down to half an inch, and things get fun. This thing is shooting water out at the speed of sound. That's right. Put on your earmuffs, strap this puppy to something heavy and mobile, and you have the perfect riot cannon. Townsfolk acting up? Fire a warning shot. They will be deaf now, but at least you didn't aim at them and strip the flesh from their bones.

It's made the learning curve for a complete newbie tackleable. 


Last night I both discovered and used [Roll20](http://roll20.net/), and man oh man did this change the experience.  Everyone I roll with is at least 45 minutes and up to 4 hours away.  The first two session I had I  propped a laptop, pointed down at the board, and I DMed from another machine.  All of this was streamed over Google+.  It hindered the experience for everyone.  The board was blurry, the grid was hard to see, and no one could directly interact with the board.  Roll20 sounded too good to be true: online, free, searchable tokens and maps, and it has a google+ plugin?  Surely not.  But, alas, it was exactly what we needed to make the game fun for everyone.  

It was a blast to finally set a stage that aren't revealed to the players.  I can finally create an atmosphere of plunging into the unknown.  Everyone door opening, drawing back of a curtain, or intersection entered required tactics.  Where will the caster stand? What happens if a trap door separates us? Should we just turn back now?

This turned out to be a hidden city for battered women, widows, and orphans.  My character, a chaotic evil drow sorcerer, with a disturbing skull mask arcane familiar and a knack for chaos, was so pissed off about the little accidental detour that he set fire to the city, killed the fire brigade, murdered some children in his way, then walked away as thousands of people were displaced from their burning homes.

If that wasn't enough, we stopped a fleeing woman just outside the city and forced her to choose between her two children which one we would ""adopt.""  I don't remember what her real name was but we re-named her ""Phart.""  She never liked us.

1369826092.0	1f9g4f	Custom Monster Encounter: Grue	AFunnyThing-	26	4	3	"I made a custom monster encounter for my players to share. I'm aware that there's a 4e creature called ""Grue"" but it wasn't... Zorkian enough for my tastes. In the new build, it's less of a monster to fight and more of an encounter to play that can be dished out in any situation you may need filler space for.

So, here's the stats regarding the encounter:

**Zorkian Grue CR 5**

*Monsterous Outsider*

DEX +3 STR +2; Darkvision 60 ft.; Perception +20 / Aura: Engulfing Darkness (Entire Container)

AC 25, touch 10, flat-footed 19; (+3 Dex, +11 Natural) hp 84 (8d8+48) / Fort +10, Ref +15, Will +73

Base Atk +9; CMB +15; CMD 25 (can't be tripped)

Spell Like Abilities: *Engulfing Darkness* - the Grue radiates an engulfing darkness that fills the entire enclosure of it's containment. This darkness degrades darkvision, allowing only 2 feet of sight. If using magical light, the light radiates for a maximum of two feet before it is no longer effective.

-----------------------------------------------------

The name of the game is Perception Checks and blundering around in the darkness. When asked for a description of the area, the DM must always say the phrase: ""It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten.""

Before the crawl, the DM must write down two objects. One is *Brass Lantern* and the other is *Tinderbox.* Next to each write a number between 2-19, indicating their position in the darkness.

To navigate Engulfing Darkness, the players must roll a d20. A 1 lands them back at the entrence where they began, a 20 has them at the exit. Any number aside from that is noted as a random location within the darkness of the player. Before entering the darkness, the players must all roll initiative while the DM rolls for the Grue. This will determine the order they employ the challenge.

Then, in order, each player rolls. If the player has a torch they are assumed to be able to see one number above and below their own and are immune to attacks from the Grue (the Grue cannot exist in light). If a player is without light they must make a perception check at negatives to search their own spot.

If the player ends up next to the Grue or upon the Grue's number, it initates an attack of opportunity in favor of the Grue which is treated as a BITE grapple. Normal rules apply as battle continues. The Grue may be hit while in Grapple. If presented with light, it flees and the grapple is broken instantly.

If two players are on the same dice number or on adjoint dice numbers, they may interact as normal with one another.

Once the *Brass Lantern* is found and lit (the tinderbox is on the ground in case your party is full of idiots who haven't learned that light is a valuable tool for dungeon crawling), it shines a glorious light that cuts through the veil of the Darkness. There is a shriek. The Grue is now hiding in cracks in the floors and walls itself.

In my game I had a player goad out a Grue into his pack to try to capture it. The Grue ended up destroying everything in his pack and when he opened it in sunlight it killed the Grue... And his stuff, of course."	t5_2qwdo	True
1368622611.0	1edods	Explain the Imbalance of Psionics	EdOharris	25	1	51	"The 3.0 psionic handbook was the first D&amp;D manual I ever read, and I thought the whole premise was awesome. I've played psionic characters in multiple campaigns and allowed them in ones I've DM'd with no real problems arising from the psionic characters. 

However I've had a few DM's that outright banned psionics (which is fine) and seen lots of people talk about allowing psionic classes being a huge problem/mistake. Why is this? Have I been lucky, or is there something major that I'm missing that makes them dumb?

**Edit**- The consensus seems to be that psioncs from 3.0 onward are actually fairly balanced if treated with transparency (which I do) and that lots of people either remember 2.0 psionics, don't realize the trade-offs of psioncs vs magic, or just don't want to deal with the system/include it in their world. This actually makes me really happy because I love psioncs so much. Thanks for the info.

1370533834.0	1fsog2	Etiquette question	MyndzAye	27	3	13	"  I recently started playing again after a 20-some year hiatus.  Five players and a DM make up a seven member party in a 3.5 game currently adventuring in a published 2.0 dungeon that's been updated to 3.5 spec's.
  The thing is, I am really not enjoying the dungeon at all.  If this were a book, I would have put it down long ago.
  So, last weekend, we experienced a TPK and we're all starting over again with 4th level characters.  This has brought me to a point where what I'd rather do is drop out of the party and rejoin them again, after they have finished with this dungeon and are ready to adventure elsewhere.

**EDIT:** I have found multiple comments in different forums stating that I should compare the MMs with the creatures listed in the SRD and OGL. If I find that the monster is in either the SRD or OGL, it's free to use. Here are links to monsters that are free to use:

1369514913.0	1f1paf	Introducing D&amp;D: Pryme, A New Recorded Session YouTube Channel!	Dndpryme	24	4	2	"Greetings, everyone. I'm the DM of an ongoing campaign, and we have decided to share our exploits with you. We call it D&amp;D: Pryme, and we're excited to have you listen and hear your feedback. So if you enjoy D&amp;D as a spectator sport, want to gain insight into how others play your beloved game, have a desire to troll the crap out of five blundering idiots, or perhaps you love the game but can't organize one in your local area and want to live vicariously through us, by all means join us at our YouTube channel.

**Who are you?**
	We are five very good friends who have been gaming together and independently for a very long time. This campaign is relatively new, having started in March of this year. I am the DM, and the party is composed of four players: a gnome barbarian named Bui, a half-orc druid named Throg, a human wizard named Gage, and a human monk named Nerys. 

**What do you do?**
	We play D&amp;D and try to tell a compelling story, have fun, and be entertaining. Sometimes we fail at one or all of these things, but occasionally we succeed. We play using the 3.5 ruleset, and our campaign is set on my homebrew world of Pryme.
	Every episode is roughly half an hour long. I cannot guarantee our discussions remain family-friendly, nor can I guarantee that we are able to stay on topic at all times. Frequently we will divulge in discussion regarding other nerdy hobbies‚Äîtv shows, video games, card games, and so forth. There's even a delightful discussion about shemales at one point. Something for everyone, I suppose. 
	While there is plenty of combat involved, first and foremost we are interested in crafting, telling, and sharing a compelling story with each other and with you. As the DM, I enjoy creating a vibrant, living world for my players to explore, and as my players, they in turn enjoy ruining all my best laid schemes. The combination creates said compelling story, however, and I think the one we're weaving is good enough to share.

**When do you upload?**
	I try to upload every day, Monday through Friday. This schedule fluctuates erratically though. I'm hoping it will eventually settle into a more routine schedule eventually. For now, however, one can expect at least one and at most five episodes a week.

**Why should I care?**
	Because we're funny! We try to be, at least. Sometimes, if you're our wizard, it doesn't work out well for you, but the resulting cavalcade of insults more than makes up for it. 
	Also, we are dedicated role-players more interested in the story than in min-maxxing or bashing dungeon doors. We think that focusing on the narrative lends itself naturally to a storytelling setting, and that it would make listening to us a thing that might be considered enjoyable to some.

If you're interested in checking us out, I have a few links for you:

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uml7vWQBczo) is a link to our very first episode. I will warn that the first few episodes are a little bit slow, because we spend time catching you up with the story so far, and then immediately launch into planning for a large-scale battle.

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Z7Qqt8jYc) is a link if you want to skip right to the battle, although you might be a little lost without the context granted in the first few episodes.

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJXhhIGvrcE) is what is probably my favorite episode so far, in which the players meet an NPC that is diametrically opposed to their viewpoint, but instead of turning them into the authorities opts to have a reasoned discussion and debate with them over dinner.

We are all eager to hear your feedback, comments, criticisms, and so forth, even if it's just to say, ‚ÄúYou all suck, you should go kill yourselves.‚Äù I mean, something more constructive is encouraged, but I realize that this is the internet, after all."	t5_2qwdo	True

My Dad told me a story from his youth playing some good ole D&amp;D with my uncle (mother's brother). My dad had a Lawful Good Paladin named McDouglas, and my uncle had a neutral wizard named Veridan, both around level 15. They had come across an ancient silver dragon and his horde, they began to make inquires concerning things that might turn into a possible campaign. The dragon was conversing pleasantly when my uncle decided it would be a good time to attack it with a lightning bolt... this naturally provoked the dragon, who clawed and bit my uncles wizard, now my uncle had excellent equipment but wizards aren't meant to take abuse so after the dragon's fist turn he was hurting badly, so my father's paladin healed him which put him on the dragon's shit list. My uncle during his next turn decided he'd bit off more than he could chew and attempted to teleport away leaving my father behind with a rather aggravated dragon, but he failed his concentration check, my father noticing his selfish action decided to act as any lawful good character would in this situation and he hurled his sword at my uncle... His vorpal sword that is. Naturally he rolled a 20, and then managed to confirm the crit resulting in a swift yet justified end to my uncles douchey wizard (who was his favourite to play) When my uncles head rolled off his blood spattered shoulders and to the floor my father begged the dragon's pardon and with his high charisma had no issue resolving the matter. My uncle on the other hand had to tear up his character sheet since my dad had no desire to find anyone to bring him back. He did give him a burial I'm told, which in my opinion is more than he deserved.

TL;DR My dad's pally decapitated my uncles wizard for being a dick. "	t5_2qwdo	True

* First off, I would like to note that I've only playtested one time, and only fighter. My friend wasssssss a Barbie.
* Advantage is awesome. Just sayin'. It's realistic.

* Using STR, DEX, CON, WIS, INT, and CHA saving throws, instead of pigeonholing your saves into just a few abilities is awesome. There are definite times where my character would use his Strength instead of ""Reflex""(which is simply stated as a ""physical"" save). A lock of swords comes to mind: roll a STR Save to hold your . Also consider a CHA save: there would be times where you have to be very persuasive or charming to get what you want. It's a good(new) system.

* Backgrounds make things very easy. 3.5 was OBNOXIOUS with all the paperwork and doling out of skill points. So much easier to say you're just good at a few things, and they get better in four levels or so, OR you expand your horizons, adding a new skill. Cool!

* Death and dying is much easier and more straightforward than before. Both my buddy and I came to 0 HP, but got out of it and rallied. Kinda reminds me of....I dunno, your overall constitution? How much spirit do you have? Roll a d20 to see!

Fighter: 
* Very cool abilities right from the get-go. 

* Choosing a tree for defense or offense capabilities iiiiiiiiiiiiiis sick. Specializing your character and his abilities is something I really like to do

* I would definitely just like to choose one tree and be able to use any of those capabilities(death dealer or superior defense) at any time, after spending an expertise dice. 

* Parry is just a crappy version of Nimble Dodge. One idea I had to change Parry for the better(and differentER)was to say ""roll your expertise dice and subtract that number from the attacker's roll"". Yeah, it's basically the same thing, but whatever. I would see people using nimble dodge **ALWAYS** instead of Parry. Maybe make Parry into AC+Expertise Die Roll+1?

* The Fighter's Martial Feats make it really seem like you're in an actual battle(Warning Shout is a good example. **""HEY DUDE LOOK OUT!""** is something I constantly say in battle.) instead of a boring clash of the dice.


Barbarian:
* The no pants(no armor) bonus is awesome, and makes sense for a barbarian. Immediately my friend said ""I'm in a leather bikini with gloves and boots. Nothing else."" That makes for hilarious.

* Damage resistance description during Rage is unclear. I can see it getting unbalanced if it's a percentage. Maybe if you got a Rage DR die for every 4(or so) levels of Barb. or it could increase in die number, like:

Lvl1-Minus 1 DAM

Lvl2-d2

Lvl3-d2+1

Lvl4-d4

Lvl5-d4+1

Lvl6-d6 and so on.

* Reckless attack is awesome, and also indicative of a barb.

My buddy and I do have a suggestion for critical misses: 

* If a 1 is rolled on a melee attack, roll **5 or under** again(basically shit the bed twice) for an attack against an (only)adjacent ally(like a wild swing, when you're in a stuffy battleground you may accidentally miss your opponent and hit your buddy) or if ranged, a crit miss may veer off course and hit an ally adjacent(5ft) to the target. Just a suggestion.

We have a level 1 Mage and Fighter (small group 2 PC, and 1 DM) and they both seem to have the same chances.

The fighter has a strength bonus of +5 and is attacking a goblin (AC 15)
So this means he needs to roll a 10+ or 50% chance to hit.

Same with the Mage, 5+ Intelligence vs Goblin's Will 13. (Ok the Mage has a slightly better chance, but doesn't seem by much)

Now I don't have the names of these attacks on hand, but I know I have a few of them that are Int vs. Will, or Reflex (14)

Is this correct? should we only be hitting 50% of the time? Are we missing something? Maybe it gets better after we level up a bit?

From RPG video games, you seem to miss more like 25%.

I received the race/class pair: Gnome Bard. This I find to be very flavorful, and I look forward to adopting this persona and creating this hero (I appreciate good flavor. I play MagicTCG lol.) yet my other friends all received some variation of Elf with Sorcery/Wizardy. So now we have a very nondiverse group of race/class pairings excluding myself...

This being said, I can see how the popular choice for D&amp;D would be some variant of being a human or elf because those races are seen to be handsome, attractive, or glorious while the others look silly or ugly.

So, once I found out all my friends are going for those humdrum, typical elf-ranger/wizard combos I can't help but think that maybe the character I was handed by the survey is a little bit.... well .... too odd for this group.

I do appreciate flavor immensely but I just don't know what to do about my PC in light of the fact that I am a beginner (lol) and that my D&amp;D group may begin its first adventure as a group of Hollywood clich√©s.

I want to ask you all for advice as to what to do about my D&amp;D group AND what to do about my own PC.

1359954064.0	17umta	Pokemon Trainer Class for 3.5	asmondaus	22	5	7	"So my basic idea is to have an at will spell to summon a pet (pokemon), start with only 1 beast or magical beast that is weak enough for starter levels, it would level up similar to druid pets and familiars and such. You would also get a spell to basically check your knowledge of creatures (pokedex) to find out basic abilities of things that you could catch. To catch something you would have to weaken it to at least 1/4 HP (you would find out it's HP% by the pokedex ability) then use a capture spell against it's will DC 10+class level+Cha modifier. If you succeed, it disappears into another dimension (or something like that) then you may summon it whenever you want. You can only catch things that have HD‚â§your class level. You can have 1 creature captured per character level and you can forget 1 summon to learn another. It would mainly b beasts and magical beasts that are captureable. Your creatures would regain HP quickly when not summoned and if they die then they are gone forever. Other than that you would have some basic spell casting abilities, probably not too much melee capabilities.

On top of that, my actual experiences with table top players have been quite negative. One two occasions, I accidentally wandered into their world (showed up at the hobby shop at the right time and place), and I felt intimidated and frankly a little scared by the way I was treated.

The DM for the one-shot campaign told me that we'll be send on a mission, and if we succeed the mission we'll all get 1k gold. However, the mayor that send us on the mission, told me specifically, that if I'm the only one to make it back from the mission, I will receive all the gold. If I share this info with any other PCs or NPCs, I would never be free again.

So the DM told this only to me, none of the other players know this. The campaign is set next monday evening, and quite frankly, as the rogue I am, I want that money.

We're playing the campaign with 5 players + the DM. It seems unlikely for me to be able to kill all of the other players, so I was wondering what are some things I can, and am allowed to do, to make sure the other players will not make it back to the city?

I figured I could kill 1 or 2, and maybe lock the rest up or something? But I don't know the specifics, so I need some help here.

**NOTE: We are playing this campaign for fun. The group of players I play with are a relaxed group of people with a lot of humor. This is a one-shot campaign, so it will not affect our characters in the normal campaign we're running.** "	t5_2qwdo	True

I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons and various similar titles for over 15 years now, been a DM for the last half of that and a big change is coming up and I hope the community could help point me in the right direction, maybe followup with some personal experiences. 

My group and I (7 of us including one 7 yr old) have been playing 4th edition on and off for awhile now. One shots here and there, a couple 2 or 3 session adventures. I finally put together that long Lvl 1 to lvl 30 story arc. Been filling filling with altered pre-made modules and some original content as well. It has been a fantastic journey. Recently, two of my players (and the child coincidentally) announced that they would be moving within the year across the country. Life moves on but i want to continue the story. 

We aren't strangers to using computers while we play, I manage the story with Masterplan and combat with CombatManager. It works out great and we stay focused really well. 

Heres the biggy; do i conclude the story where ever we are at close to the move date or do I try to transition it all online? I would have to do more that Skype, we have some pretty serious visual aids going on. I have looked into Roll20.net and it looks ok integrated with a google hangout. 

What I'm looking for here, has anyone else done this with there group? Or does anyone play online regularly and have some pointers? The group would certainly be willing to do it, I just want to provide the groundwork for them when we get to that bridge.

A few weeks ago my group had the most painstakingly boring session in tabletop history as the party made their way to their first town. I'm the DM for the campaign and previous sessions seemed to go well as all we had done so far was some fighting/exploring in a series of dungeons I had drawn up to start the campaign off with a bang. the group reached the MacGuffin at the end of the dungeon (a Dragon gave them knowledge of the quest ahead) and the party was eager to continue. 

This brings us to the session in question. The party enters the town and I have a map drawn up, but they decide to roll Gather Information to find the closest trader. After the party barbarian scares a woman on the street when forgetting how to speak (crit. misses bring good laughs) the ranger calms her and she points out the storefront down the road. The party makes it there and are greeted by the shopkeeper whom I can't keep a steady accent on as I fumble over myself having everyone roll Appraise checks and other things while failing at trying to make it interesting. Needless to say, the group decided afterword that something about that whole thing needed to change.

So I turn to you, /r/rpg to guide me on the path to being a better DM. How do you all approach transactions or exploring markets in your campaigns while keeping it interesting? thanks in advance!

1359375164.0	17fbci	Barring PC's From Playing Evil. Why?	EdOharris	17	2	51	"I'll start out by saying I'm both an experienced player and DM. I've played in or DM'd at least 20 games of various lengths with varying degrees of success. I've been invited to play in a camping with some friends of mine with the DM being a friend of a friend. 

It's a world where magic users have to be registered with the government (or something, not to many details given yet) and we're a team sent to hunt rogue mages. My only gripe is we've been tolled we can't be evil.

I've never DM'd or played in a campaign with this restriction, and am a little bothered by it. I've played plenty of evil characters and never once been a major disruption to the game, senselessly killed party members, or really made a nuisance of myself, and it annoys me that 1/3 of the alignments are off limits. It seems like something an inexperienced DM would do, but I've been told ours is pretty seasoned.

My first question is why would you impose such a restriction on anyone except brand new players, and more importantly; how do you deal with pc's if they can't ever be evil? What if they break the law in a big way? What if they murder somebody? They won't get alignment switched because they can't be evil. Does the character get forcibly retired? What about a character snapping and turning to the dark side (with good reason of course)? It seems like the DM is limiting both himself, and us as players with such a simple restriction.

**Edit**- Thanks for all the input guys. I didn't realize how common a thing this was to do. There's been some pretty solid advice here and I plan to roll something neutral. Alignment question: Can you enjoy hurting people without being evil?

1376326189.0	1k7s7n	"Is the ""Red Box"" starter set really toned down?"	zarroc123	18	5	16	"So, I bought a red box starter set from a book store a few weeks ago. I was pretty excited because cost was always my biggest drawback from trying DnD for the first time. It's a 4th edition red box, and the copyright is from 2011. But, as luck would have it, I also found a copy of the 4th edition players book and the Dungeon Masters Guide for 5 dollars for both at a garage sale. 


I had already read the small players book and dungeon masters book in the red box, so I started the small pre-built campaign in the red box with some friends. We had a lot of fun, and are really looking forward to playing some more. But, then I started to read the full sized players handbook and realized there were quite a few rules discrepancies. I expected the starter set to be a bit limited in race and class choices, but the characters we built in the Red Box were far weaker than the characters/classes described in the big book. Now, while the Red Box is copyright 2011 the books I have are copyright 2008. They both say they are 4th edition, but does the time difference explain the differences?


What my friends and I did was quickly rebuild their characters (I'm DM) while they were still level one using the guidelines and powers described in the big book. I'm just really glad I realized the differences before they made it further than one encounter, because it would have been frustrating knowing their characters were severely nerfed. Just wondering if anyone could explain why it was so different!

Specific List of differences:

* stances were a big part of the Red Box fighter class, but not mentioned in the Big books.

* Class features were all but ignored in the Red Box

* Many racial characteristics not described in Red Box (Except the Dwarven ones, for some reason)

* Some of the powers in the Red Box weren't in the Big book.

* The red box never mentions assisted dice rolls (Something that sounds like a huge help)

* The red box never describes some of the more useful combat actions (Grabbing, readying actions, and focusing on defense etc.)

Red Box - http://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Fantasy-Roleplaying-Game/dp/0786956291/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368539525&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=redbox+dungeons+and+dragons

or

Pathfinder - http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/products/beginnerbox

I can't tell the difference other than hardcore gamers prefer Pathfinder because you can play more campaigns in the long run than you could with the redbox. The issue is that I don't know how much we'll play but I want the best experience for all of us; if that means we need to start with something complicated to get the most out of the game, than so be it.

If I do get either starter kit, do I need to buy anything else? Do I need a players handbook or DM guide? Again, none of us have any experience so I don't know how one of us will be DM without some sort of guidance. What about extra dice? Is that necessary if I buy the kit?

So reddit I ask you: which should I get?

""This deals no damage but drags the
stuck opponent 10 feet closer... unless that creature breaks free, which
requires a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 19 Strength check.
The check DCs are Strength-based, **and the Escape Artist DC
includes a +4 racial bonus.**"" (emphasis is mine)
(Roper, p. 216)

What does this mean?  Are they saying that anyone trying this check gets a +4 racial bonus?  Or is it particular races?  How do I know which races?

Or is this an opposed check on which the roper gets a +4 bonus?  It seems really ambiguous, and I'm confused..."	t5_2qwdo	True

First I want to thank you for taking the time to answer my question, as I'm sure this get's asked all the time. Let me mention I have no source materials, no dice, and only a video-gamer's knowledge of D&amp;D from all the Baldur's Gate and Planescape I played as a kid. What I do have is two additional players with dice-roller and PC manager apps eager to try an adventure. Any help is greatly appreciated!

*edit:* Update. We played. Thanks for the awesome tips guys, you've been a huge help. It wasn't the most graceful or ""by the book"" game ever, but we got a good feeling for it. I think our next step is probably going to be both A) Find a DM to skype with us or something and b) Study the DM book from cover to cover as was recommended. I'm absolutely looking for folks to play with either in person or via gametable software, so please hit me up if you don't mind a n00b :)

1368963241.0	1emk5e	Need some help with a TWF build	Spooferfish	17	2	25	"So I wanted to make a fighter for a friend's ongoing campaign that dished out damage similar to that of the wizards, druids, and psions our campaign runs into. I wanted to do this without touching ToB at all/minimally, and without using any spells or anything like that. I wanted a pure-blooded warrior that just goes in and smashes things to bits. To do that, and not cheat at all, I figured I should take a look at the TWF options, since experience with games classically has that as the highest damage output option. 

First, some house rules:

1. You can have +1 LA without the adjustment, but you forgo a % roll to see how much XP you start with at the starting level. We do not scale XP, everyone gets XP based on how much they did (generally even across everyone if everyone did damage/tried to fight).

2. We max out HD, and any skills you take as class skills are unlocked across all levels, not just the ones you took them over. This is counteracted by the baddies we fighting having higher saves and generally a bit ahead of our preferred challenge rating, as everyone is decently optimized. 

3. He'll be starting, for now, at level 6.

4. For stats, we roll a 5d6 (best of 3) array. I got pretty lucky, and got 14/18/17/16/13/12, which with Racials comes to 18/16/19/13/12. The +1 at level 4, and every other one as well, will go into dex (except one to con for a bonus to health and fort).

Race: Goliath. This gives us a few awesome things: +4 str and +2 con, which are great, but -2 dex hurts. 

The reason I went for this guy is the lack of damage a dervish normally really gets, and 1. powerful build 2. standing jumps being long jumps. This plays in REALLY well for Dervish's dance ability, especially with spring attack. 

So! This is the current plan:

1. Swashbuckler 1: Weapon finesse, Combat expertise 
2. Swashbuckler 2: Grace +1 (reflex bonus)
3. Swashbuckler 3: Insightful strike (+int to dmg with light weapons), Expeditious dodge (counts for dodge)  
4. Fighter 1: Mobility, +1 dex
5. Fighter 2: Weapon Focus (scimitar)
6. Dervish 1: Dervish dance 1/day, movement mastery, slashing blades, TWF
7. Dervish 2: Fast movement +5ft, +1 AC
8. Dervish 3: Spring attack, dervish dance 2/day, +1 dex
9. Dervish 4: Dance of death, ITWF 
10. Dervish 5: Fast movement +10 ft, dervish dance 3/day
11. Dervish 6: Improved reaction
12. Dervish 7: Elaborate parry, dervish dance 4/day, Improved critical, +1 dex
13. Dervish 8: Fast movement +15ft
14. Dervish 9: Tireless dance, dervish dance 5/day
15. Dervish 10: A thousand cuts, GTWF
16. Tempest 1: Tempest defense +1, +1 con
17. Tempest 2: Ambidexterity 1
18. Tempest 3: Tempest defense +2, two-weapon versatility, Flay foe
19. Tempest 4: Ambidexterity 2
20. Tempest 5: Tempest defense +3, two-weapon spring attack, +1 dex

I'll be using, as soon as level 6, two large scimitars. This lets me use them both at just the -2, and add intelligence to both using insightful strike. The 1d8 versus 2d6 isn't a huge difference, especially when so much of the damage is coming from other sources (flay foe, dance, focus, intelligence, and strength)

Assuming I get his con to 20, that puts him at 300 HP. His dex will likely be much higher, but for our purposes let's assume 22 Dex (only a +2 dex tome). His saves become +14/+16/+10, though I'd try to shore up the will save. Assuming 22 dex and a mithal chain shirt, we're looking at 10+6+4+3+3=26 AC, without any other bonuses being applied (magical items, better dex bonus [enough to make armor pointless, or padded leather a better option], and combat expertise use). During a dervish dance, very few AOOs will be taken, as spring attack lets you single out 1v1 opponents while an extremely high tumble and movement mastery makes tumbling past foes insanely easy to pass (you can just take 10, which gives you a 30+ tumble. With nimble stand (later upgraded to back on your feet) trip attempts while you're tumbling/moving past do little if anything. In cases when an AOO is taken during a dance, mobility puts you at 30 AC. Expeditious dodge will always be used (constantly moving, jump ensures over 40 feet), so I'd almost always get that +2 to AC as well.

With a high perform (dance) I'd be dancing for most if not all of an encounter, and at level 15 I'd be getting 14 attacks per dance. Jumping during a dance, which requires no movement except for the jump (which can easily cover 30 feet given the ability to take 10 in combat), lets me cover bigger distances than my fast movement would normally allow. Flay foe at 18 also gives an extra +1d6 on an opponent during each attack in the round, and assuming I'm fighting something big that I can attack for my full round, that means +13d6 if I hit every attack just on the bonus damage from A Thousand Cuts. All of these attacks, btw, are at -2 of my BAB, which is huge due to full BAB, weapon focus, weapon finesse, +5 during a dance, etc. Tempest levels just add AC while taking away that -2 to hit, as well as making my spring attack a two-weapon attack.

So What I need help with is this: am I making any major mistakes in this? Are there better feat choices? Are there any items that I HAVE to get (other than the standard fighter tax of +dex, +str, +con items. I'll also be getting +int items for free skills and damage bonus to each attack)? Overall, does this seem playable? 

Thank you!

EDIT: Decided to use two large scimitars instead. This makes both of them a light weapon, applying insightful strike damage to both. Outweighs 2d6 increase from 1d8 for huge to large, even if it was legal to use a huge light weapon as a large one-handed weapon."	t5_2qwdo	True

1369608400.0	1f3s36	D &amp; D RULING QUESTION [Trance / Extended Rest]	Symion	18	5	12	"Setup: Dungeons and Dragons 4e
Playing: Eladrin
Ruling Dispute: Trance
Problem: DM says that Trance has a 12 hour cool-down based on ""Extended-Rest""



Trance:
&gt;Rather than sleep, eladrin enter a meditative state known as trance. You need to spend 4 hours in this state to gain the same benefits other races gain from taking a 6-hour extended rest. While in a trance, you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal.

Extended Rest
&gt;Once per day, a creature can gain the benefits of an extended rest
Duration: An extended rest is at least 6 hours long.
Once per Day: After a creature finishes an extended rest, it has to waint 12 hours before beginning another one
&gt;At the end of an extended rest, a creature regains all lost hit points, spent healing surges, the use of expended encounter powers and daily powers. It also loses any unspent action points, but starts fresh with 1 action point.

What do you think?

1368741266.0	1eh86i	I think I need some advice to not just ragequit my game =/	BabaXIII	19	7	17	"Hello, 

I've been DM'ing for likes 4-5 years now (On and Off) and I've come accross many groups, my problem currently is that I've found great friends(for me and my GF) that love D&amp;D, but that cause lots of awkward moments.

What I mean by this is: My friend and his GF will sometimes argue silently with one another and one or both of them will be frustrated and the other will try to say they are sorry. It all turns into a big drama fest and I always try to calm them down. I tell them to just say what they need to say and get it over with, but they never do and we end up that our (5 party member + me) party is ridiculously awkward. 
Yesterday we had a game of about 6-7 hours. It was quite fun, but at the beginning and near the end, my friend was pouting for nothing(his girlfriend badly opened his ramen so the seal was not able to prevent the steam from leaking, we gave him a plate to cover it and all was well)
Problem is, he pouted for nothing and every was feeling it. As a Master I'm starting to grow impatient and tired of all this, but I don't want to stop playing because they all say they're having so much fun with this new game( Homebrew Post Apocalyptic Fantasy setting). 

I guess this sounds like quite the rant, so here's the actual question I need advice on: how do you explain to a PC that what he's trying to do is unreasonable if he is a power gamer? 

My friend plays a Mechaniks in this game. It's a mage that attracts metal and uses it to throw grenades and create turrets and stuff. He was near another player when a werewolf-type creature jumped from the ceilling to attack another PC near him, my friend (Let's call him Mike for now) says he gets an opportunity attack because the enemy entered his range. I say no because the enemy is too quick and Mike already attacked. Following the ''6 seconds per turn'' rule, he would never be able to swing his Gladius with speed and damage. It's just unreasonable. 
So after much arguing I tell him he doesn't get the opportunity attack, he starts pouting. My GF gets it however because she's a gunner with a rifle and she's the one with the most Speed(new stat for this homebrew) in the party, so she shoots the creature and Mike pouts some more. Another friend tells me later that when Mike and his GF went smoking, Mike was whining about it again. 

I'm just wondering what to do with this player because he's becoming an incredibly arrogant guy and an annoying power gamer, but I can't do much about it because we're good friends and I don't want to piss him off because of D&amp;D. 

Sorry for the rant and the long text, I hope this place is the right subreddit for this."	t5_2qwdo	True

I did a dream sequence where I described what they were doing and had them roll to help identify certain elements that were going on in the dream.

But I'm missing the awesome stories! That's part of the game, right?? You set out on an adventure with friends (or people who can become your friends) to come back with a cool story, so let's hear some! I'll start:

The most recent campaign I've been playing, our party started out waking up in a strange, dark room all together. A halfling Paladin(PC), a Warforged Cleric(NPC), and a human Rogue(PC). We were confused, angry, and my Rogue was hungover from the night before. None of us had ever met any of the other people before. No clue how any of us got in this room. As we're trying to backtrack ourselves, the wall at the far end of this dark room slides open. The blinding light from beyond that point is slightly eclipsed by a gigantic Oni Samurai(PC) who looks permanently grumpy. Most of us reach for weapons only to realize - yet again - that none of us have any of our possessions.

So this big guy gives us a short, terse apology for the rude awakening, and tells us all that we have basically been conscripted into the service of the Olympian Brotherhood. Most of the other characters are protesting, but the Rogue is just asking how much he's getting paid. We're told that time is short and more information will be given if we can prove our worth on our first mission.

Wat.

So we meet Ares. Yes, Ares. Like the Greek god, only he's just an NPC. Ares introduces us to the quartermaster, Hephaestus, and to our mission briefer Hermes. They three *quickly* explain that we were chosen for the brotherhood for different reasons, blah blah.... oh and by the way if you try to run, that little necklace you're wearing will explode and decapitate you. Yeah. Also don't try to take it off, 'cause bad news there, too.

More wat. We're told that there is some weird Mage by the name of Bex in this small town, and he has possession of a really old, really important book that if used correctly could spell doom and destruction for the whole planet. Rogue asks about pay again and is cut off in the ""you'll have access to the best weaponry ever known to mankind if you can do this"" response. The Paladin is all for helping innocent people who have no idea they are in any danger. The Warforged seems pretty complacent about the whole situation. We then find out that the Samurai who retrieved us earlier is going to be leading us, as he's been with the Brotherhood for a while.

Teleport outside the city, the rest of the group gathers around the Samurai to ask questions about what we're doing. Hermes's voice pops into our heads (as he explains is a telepathic ability given to us by the same exploding head-braces) and tells us we need to get going. The Rogue is already headed down the road.

Fast forward a little bit. We find out that Bex is living in this old clock tower that is supposed to only be used for government services. He's there by the mayor's orders. Rogue bluffs his way to the top of the tower for ""hired watch"" and as he's on his way up sees that Bex is into necromancy.

Paladin gets pissed, and convinces the Samurai to bullrush the guards that the Rogue bluffed his way past. Remember, this guy is HUGE. Like 7' 11"", 560lbs pure muscle. (Just under the minimum requirements for a ""Large"" character) The two guards at the entrance balk and jump clear of him then chase him in. The one guy, Steve, guarding the stairs (who was also sleeping) jumps up, shakes off his fatigue and fucking LAYS OUT THE ONI with ONE HIT. The Paladin and the Warforged are still making their way up to where the Samurai ran in, and the Rogue is halfway down the staircase. As the two other characters catch up with the guards inside and try to talk them down, ""Miracle-Strike"" Steve's brain suddenly clicks and he realizes the Rogue must be part of this. Cue Rogue flying through stairway door threshold and attempts to disarm Steve as he is closest. Steve sidesteps and throws another mighty blow and knocks the Rogue down to -6. W. T. F.

Paladin and Warforged Cleric melee for a bit and finally subdue Steve (not without him knocking out the Paladin once first, again one hit) and kill one of the other guards. The remaining guy has a life-changing epiphany just then and decides to find a new line of work. We make our way up to Bex, albeit limping a bit. Kick in his door, Rogue sprints for the book and tried to pick it up. It's a big ass book too. Well, it doesn't budge and it also sets off a burning-hands trap. Paladin takes some damage but he's okay. Rest of the party starts fighting off a few zombies and a skeleton in the room. The Rogue, realizing that picking up the book isn't going to happen, vaults over the pedestal and stabs Bex pretty squarely. Bex gets pissed and commands the zombies to attack me, he grabs the book, pulls out a scroll of teleport, and disappears. We finish off the undead in the room and proceed to hightail it out of the city. Once we're far enough out, Hermes brings us back to the Helepolis for a quick healing-over. They tracked Bex to another location and gear us up for transport again.

And then the session ended. Was a great start to what has been an awesome campaign. The DM acknowledged that it started out a bit railroady, but we all agreed that given the directives of the Brotherhood, it made sense. Since then our missions have evolved into much more freedom and a lot more adventures have occurred.

Also, I neglected to mention that Miracle-Strike Steve was only a direct, from-the-book, Warrior 1. No character sheet. Nothing like that. But because of his ""skill"" as far as the PCs saw, the Oni requested that a team be dispatched and Steve be recruited to the Brotherhood. Still wondering if we'll see him again."	t5_2qwdo	True

1353523445.0	13ku3s	My homebrew content for a Wild West themed d&amp;d campaign. Input is welcome	RonanKarr	13	0	9	"Hey there guys, so basically this is a more modernized campaign inside of a d&amp;d world that I have created over the years for my campaign settings known as Terrath. It follows the d&amp;d pantheon and culture setting. The story lines and history differ from d&amp;d settings that are out there. For this campaign, the setting is after a major purging of magic as a result of some really bad events and the fear of the masses so magic is pretty limited and forgotten. However it is still present. It has moved to a monotheistic society as the old gods are long forgotten. The idea behind this setting is that the party members are monster hunters. Any input is welcome.

Now I can't seem to understand how magical items/upgrading works. In the 4th edition handbook, there are a lot of items listed for certain classes, proficiency, etc. Now this may seem silly, but are those the *only* items? I'd would like to hope I can make any kind of items I'd like for my friends to find or enchant, but are there 'rules' to creation? How would my players go out getting ""+5 Sword of Awesomeness""?

Also- Are there any good tools for making a decent playing mat? The 4th Ed. Red box that we picked up came with a double sided map, but it would get really old really fast to keep seeing the same tiles. I'm hoping to print out a decent sized map we could tape together, etc.

Those are the most important things I could think of for now, i suppose if anything else comes up Id add it.

The party have come together when the world is most troubled. 
A group of peoples have come to settle the Isle of Elmalur, The Lightlanders, lead by a cortupt cleric of of twisted god, he latter comes to outlsaw all other gods.

Then attempts to bring this god inti the world to 'Cleanse it of it's sin'

(apart from his being a FREAKING God of Destruction and Decite)
is that he's spanned the Multiverse creating fractured copies of himself,
So you defeat him in one reality, another version pops up in another, getting gradually weaker each time.

So my question now is, How do I get my characters from one reality to another?
Is one of them a fractured version of a God of Portals and Knowledge?

Xyranthis	13	3	18	"I am playing a Neutral Good Half-Ogre Fighter, and in my group's current campaign, we were required to hunt down certain dragons for components.  In the Forgotten Realms world, we're doing sort of a modified Time of Troubles and are finding weapons of power to defeat evil god's Avatars (Cyric for sure and 2 other unknowns) And some craziness went down in one of the ruins above a black dragon's lair.

First, the aura of the area started to shift everyone's alignment one to the south (I became True Neutral), and while killing a Fel Drake I was hit with a curse of Living Death.  Now all of my flesh is falling off and I'll be reduced to a skeleton.

Good parts include: 100% Piercing reduction, 50% Slash reduction, I won't age anymore and I don't tire or need sleep, nor can I be subject to critical hits.

Bad Parts: I'm not true undead so I don't get lifesense and my Fort save is reduced to base.  This also throws a wrench in a lot of my actual roleplaying since I won't really be able to go into towns (unless I completely cover up) or really interact with any NPCs.

I'm looking for some advice on fun new ways to use this to my advantage in combat and other situations (Our group is more combat-centric than RP)

I'm 8th level, specialize in Mauls, have great STR (30), decent DEX (14) and stay really mobile (Ranks in Jump, Balance, Climb) and wear Medium armor.  We play in mostly 3.5e with elements of 2e.

TL;DR - Just became the living dead, how do I exploit it?

Thanks!

1355945695.0	154gsj	How do I help new players role play?	mredding	11	2	7	"I'm a player in a game with my significant other and another couple. My SO has played in a previous campaign I had ran, and this is a first for the other. They're both enthusiastic and enjoy the hell out of game, but my SO doesn't role play as well as she would like, and the other has no personification of her character whatsoever.

I don't really recall what my SO had said about her lack of ability, but an acknowledging ""I'm not very good at it"" seems to be the attitude, not so much an excuse to throw her hands up in the air, but more like a desire and willingness to improve. I think the other is in the same boat.

I've got a couple techniques I've suggested or will suggest to them both:

* Know the world and it's story. The better they understand the setting, the more comfortable they'll feel making shit up, like places, history, and stories.

* Write a character background. The better you know your character, the better you'll understand her motivations and personality. This has helped my SO in making decisions on my character's behalf, but is she sassy, is she quiet? Is she crazy like a Russian spy?

* I suppose I could suggest giving the character an accent, or wearing a costume to game. Anything to emmerse themselves into the persona.

* I may remind them the philosophy of role playing games is that of collaborative story telling, so tell a story, like you're trying to pitch a book/movie idea, or as if you were reading a story to someone else.

* I have to push my DM into personifying NPCs more, as he's kinda shy about it.

* Practice. Think of it like acting, that you're going to audition for a play. When no one is home, no one is around, imagine scenarios with dialogue and speak out, verbally, your character's participation.

What does the DnD community suggest to help a player personify a character?

1371983895.0	1gwj5p	Blind Man's Birthday	ZXfrigginC	10	3	2	"As my latest session has closed overnight, I had a truly satisfying victory today.

We were at someone's castle (source: DoMT), there were 3 servants and a curator. This was a chance for me to accomplish some things that were needed to be a better character.

My objective was to kill all of them. No rhyme or reason. It's a gratuitous kill meant for being eligible to gain the Assassin prestige class.

Unfortunately, trying to kill the 3rd servant led me to some major problems because he happened to be a blind man with abnormally excellent hearing. He stopped me from making this quick and painless so I could continue on with the party. Essentially, the Paladin, for the sake of being a Paladin, tied me up while I was unconscious so I could be judged in the morning when everyone was awake. Of course, I escaped the ropes.

As I awoke, the 70 year old blind man was guarding the door sitting in a chair. He had really good hearing, so I couldn't get past him without killing him first. Couldn't hit him either, because his super hearing gave him superior dodging ability.

**Skip to here if you want shorter context.**

I found a lever in the room, and given that I was running out of time, I took the noncertain death option over the certain death option. The result was a [birthday confetti shower](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-5UFp2dsqk).

He just wanted it to be a comical stab in the face of my certain death, but in my state of panic, I found a line of reasoning: the blind man's hearing was masked by the song (unlike the video I linked)! As a result, I managed to kill him and ultimately escaped.

But, looking back on it, my reasoning might not have actually held up. Should the blind man have still been able to keep up with me?"	t5_2qwdo	True

I am currently preparing for the most complex game of my life, which I will also be DMing. The game will be a traditional Middle Earth style game, but there will be one large difference, that being that I am throwing out any old modules or campaign settings for a new one that I am creating myself. I am writing the entire thousands of years long history to the game to such a level of precision that it would be on a similar level to a social studies textbook. Not only will I write the histories of Gods and empires, but those of individual cities and tribes to create the most detailed game imaginable. I am discarding all realms previously imagined for a game, and reimagining Gods and races from block one.

I am very far along in the current process, but not everything can be imagined by me alone. I need help creating filler ideas from anything from inividual heroes to (most importantly, for me at least) the individual histories of towns and cities. Here is a basic rundown of the creation myth. Anything that can come after it and fits within it may be incorporated into my Campaign.

In the beginning, Only the Heavens and Gods existed. They vied for power of the Heavens, but the Gods of Light and Magic claimed dominance over it to protect it.

However, some gods were uneasy. The gods of the dragonborn, humans, undead, demons and monsters declared war upon the light and magic. The dwarf gods then joined the good side, while the elven race's gods as well as the gods of the gnomes and halflings remained neutral.

However, seperate wars embroiled between the elves and the gnomes + halflings, creating a second war.

The gods created their respective races and fought for many years. However, those of light and magic convinced the gnomes and halflings to join them, and for the elves to remain neutral. As things got worse for the dark side, the human's gods and dragonborn deities defected to join the light.

End of the day however, the undead, monsters and demons were banished to various seperate planes, while the angels and elementals were allowed to reside continually in the heavens. The remaining races were sent to the mortal plane, and lived down there.

Give me anything to help out with what happens in the mortal plane. I have a basic plot written, but its still in its baby phases. Little details and easter eggs will be the best."	t5_2qwdo	True

I've got a group of friends together that finally is able to play some D&amp;D. It turns out we were all that kid that wanted to play when we were younger, but never had a group or the means.
So we've got minimal experience, and it just turns out I have the most by virtue of having played 3 weeks in a row one time.

SO, now I find myself a first-time DM. I thought I was just going to run one or two ""getting familiar"" sessions before someone else took over, but now I find myself having to put continuity in the story line and build a story. It looks like I'll probably be doing a short campaign at the very least.

So I've built a little story that I kind of like (dragon has formed his own mafia-like organization, blackmailing the group to be his enforcers), but now JUST dungeon crawling is going to get old and won't make a ton of sense in the story. 

SO, (TL;DR) now I need a city for them to be based in. What's a good environment to work in? The only ones I know of are Forgotten Realms and Eberon. Is one setting any more friendly to new players?

I want to make it happen, but I also want to make sure it's not an overpowered idea. Any thoughts?

**Gauss Staff**

*A finely crafted Elven staff, it is a perfectly straight rod of hardened oak with a tight spiral of silver metal wound around the entire shaft. The center of the staff is hollow, and just large enough to fit your thumb inside.*

The staff can function as your average quarterstaff for whacking people, but it serves a double purpose. If the wielder places a lead sling pellet in the end of the staff, the coils of silver (or gold, or mithril, or whatever you like) can be charged with the application of Shocking Grasp to function like a railgun.

The energy of Shocking Grasp is subject to some debate - voltage, amperage, et cetera. The simplest way we can think of is to make a 1:1 transformation of damage. That is, a caster level 4 casts a 4d6 damage Shocking Grasp, or can fire a 4d6 damage pellet.

This pellet may pierce opponents - we haven't quite yet decided if this is reasonable - but an additional rule may be added that only 2d6 of damage may be applied to each enemy, if there is still damage left in the pellet's velocity the pellet exits the enemy and continues on in a straight line, applying the same attack roll to enemies in its path.

**Metagame**

A Sorceror can cast many spells per day, and Shocking Grasp is a pretty low-level spell. They could Maximize or Quicken the spell as necessary, and reloading the staff could be as simple as a pouch full of lead or iron pellets.

A Sorceror with good Dex is pretty normal, but if the staff is difficult to control (nobody said electricity was ever well-behaved) they could just True Strike themselves before firing.

Any thoughts on this? It seems like a pretty kickass idea to me, but I still want to do some electrical analysis before I can confidently say it's feasible."	t5_2qwdo	True

It's not first time being a DM, but I always feel like my games are either not detailed enough or that my players just are invested in my story. I always start them off at lvl 1 to try to get them attached to their characters, but in my newest adventure I want to start them off at lvl 20. With in the opening minutes I will have them fight a red dragon to get them to feel a sense of power and control. It will obviously be an easy fight to win. After that fight the King will throw a play in their honor. After the play a sinister being holds the theater hostage. This is all a ruse as the villain now sacrifices the audience to summon Orcus, the Demon Prince of the Undead, who uses a hammer to freeze them in stone for over a thousand years. During this time period they slowly lose their levels and they lose all the rare magical items that I gave them when they started. 
The goal of this campaign will be to find out what happened to them, defeat Orcus' generals and legions, find and defeat Orcus, and to regain their former glory. When they are freed from their imprisonment their old triumphs will be just legend and they will have almost no past, but I hope that they will want to work together to try and reclaim their lost power.

I am looking to setup a game of Pen &amp; Paper D&amp;D, but I will be doing it over skype with my friends. I have never played traditional D&amp;D before, much less over the internet, so I have some questions.

The first of course is what do I need? A good rulebook, one that is preferably somewhat condensed would be good. Are there some good pdfs I can find online, or do I need to purchase a kit? I assume we would all need proper dies. How many and which sided etc. and where can we buy a good set of these? Is there a good site where I can learn to DM? Something with example maps and stories so I can learn from, and probably some good, premade campaigns to start with.

Will this work well online? We trust each other to not lie about dice rolls and we mostly just want to have fun. Are there any programs to help us do this online?

Right now there are three of us. Some of our friends might be able to be talked into it if 4+ are needed, but can we do it with a GM and 2 players? Even if we can is it fun?

I have heard about D&amp;D, it looks interesting and I have seen some funny stories/portrayals of it, but never played it before. I am basically looking to start from scratch and would like to know what sites I should check and any information I need that may not be on them.

1361837658.0	19849x	Thoughts on XP costs? (3.5)	ProZar3000	11	3	25	"Hello [r/DungeonsAndDragons](http://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonsAndDragons/)!

I'm writing to you with some questions regarding XP costs for spells in 3.5. I happen to subscribe to party experience, as opposed to individual experience. I've been DMing several years now, and after several parties with characters who try and game XP, I made a command decision to award XP universally, thus keeping everyone leveled together. (On a side note: I don't allow races with level adjustments). To reward individuals who contribute or act more, I would give prizes in the forms of gold/magic items.

Now, most of my campaigns run from level 1 to level 15-16, and thus the highest level of magic with large XP costs (such as Wish) were often unavailable to players. However, I have brought back one of these groups for an Epic Level campaign. These are all veterans of my DMing and DnD in general, and I felt confident we would be able to play some high level encounters.

On to the question: Do any of you have thoughts for an alternative to XP costs for high level spells like Wish? Previously, XP costs had been so minimal it never played a role in denying characters from leveling. Now I have characters who can Wish and Miracle, and I worry that their use of those spells will upset the balance of my party. 

I realize I'm rambling, so I'll close with my response to a predicted objection:
&gt;But ProZar3000, since they are casting such high level magic, they are aware of the penalty involved and this balances out the use of such power!

This is of course, a great argument. However, for me, the weakness of this argument lies in my priorities as a DM. Fundamentally, my #1 goal as a DM is for my players to have an enjoyable time. The problem with shifting XP for me is the imbalance of fun that comes with it. For instance, the sorcerer casts 3 wishes in one encounter, changing reality so that it is immediately overcome. The sorcerer hogs all of the ""fun"" of passing the encounter. Later that day, now out of powerful spells, another encounter occurs in which the other members of the party overcome it together, and the sorcerer is left out of the ""fun."" Does it balance out, overall? Yes. But for me, I want everyone to be able to enjoy each encounter together.

Alrighty, time to wrap this wall of text up. Apologies. The first idea a friend proposed to me I'll leave in the comments, so it can be upvoted and downvoted in relation to better or worse ideas.

I have two friends that have heard I play, and are interested in starting out, and I would allow them to join my current campaign, but it already has about ten players, and that's excluding the DM. I would gladly get a new game going for this different group of friends, but that gets me into a new problem. I would like at least three players for a well rounded party for me to DM so they enjoy the game to its full capacity. I have a couple friends that I could potentially get to join, but there's a huge change they'll dismiss it as hugely ""nerdy"" the second ""D&amp;D"" comes out of my mouth. How exactly could I propose the idea to increase the chances of them being interested? If you actually read that entire thing, I applaud you, by the way.

I spent a few summers in early 80s playing and was never too deep in it, so I have no experience in the developments of the game since then. 

Is there a good starter set out there for a kid who wants to try this game out? I've read about the red box starter set and that sounds like it might be an option: the things most serious D&amp;D people vent about are the things that might be best for a young 'un. Overly simplified, limits to how far you can get, etc.

Also thought about checking local active games but expect they will mostly be both out of his league and out of age group. I doubt he and his second grade friends could sustain it so I guess in the end I am looking for some game set that was age appropriate and that he could either play on his own or as single player with Dad as DM.

Orcus doesn‚Äôt even know her, but Cassandra plans to be a powerful priestess of evil, and believes she is destined to be his Queen. This ‚Äòdestiny‚Äô makes Cassandra a very difficult person to be around, it is common for her narcissistic personality to make others withhold information, or even give misinformation to put her back in her place. Lacking humility and compassion, her quest is to be recognised by her love, Orcus, and join him forever in his fortress city, Naratyr, in the Abyss. Saving herself for him only, she emulates his hatred for all other creatures, but knows she must tolerate them so she can achieve her goal of recognition within the ‚ÄòSkulls‚Äô (the influential members of the followers or Orcus).

Cassandra‚Äôs past is of no consequence to other mortals and shares nothing of her origin; she is fully focussed on her goal.
Cassandra is raven haired, wears ??? armour underneath her black cloak and carries a black, scull topped sceptre. The sceptre has no magical, or martial, power. It is a symbol of her faith and is carried at all times. Shunning the use of blades she has put all time into the use of her crossbow, Wound, which she uses with deadly accuracy.

Turns out it was really just for one of the players just hates my character who is admitedly an asshole. Besides that no real problems, a couple of you could do a little more and little I could deal with a little less of this, and the lets not have 20 minute arguments in/out of game. No one else really had a problem with my character, only real character issues besides the one with mine was the one with the player opposed to me because he's interpriting lawful good more along lawful evil (saying ""You did x so I'm going to kill you"") That pissed him off, but we all setteled that shit storm... Or so I thought. End of play comes around, I go out and have a smoke said player comes up to me and says ""If your character stops being a dick, my character will stop being so lawful"", now I thought the rest of the night I had been a little nicer. Still playing my character but making sure that people aren't upset out of game. However, he tells me this, I explain yeah the last thing was harsh of me but he didn't accept my bluff role which I passed so I felt I had some right.

 What happened was we found a secrete room in a moselum for dead heroes, which I was the only one able to get into at the time, I find that it's full of gold and equipment, however, being a worshiper of wee jas I didn't feel it right to take anything and I knew that the party would want everything so I bluffed with a 21 or something like that (my bluff is +7) him and another party member get a 12 and 8 something rather low for opposing roles so I pass. However he's instistant that I'm lying because out of game he knows whats in there. So we spend 10 minutes of him not letting me out till I finally say fuck it I'll ""pray"" even though wee jas doesn't really get prayed to. DM informs me that it's all grave robber stuff and the place is under wee jas I misinterpreted that as don't touch it so I just finally tell the party what I was doing because I was tired of sitting there arguing over a door(total of 20 or 30 minutes). Still not enough for him, but he decides to open the door and DM lets me know that I misinterpreted what he said so it's a shit storm for loot.

 This ends our session. As I said he gives his you do this and I'll not do this bs, I explain and he says stop countering me and do what I said. I just told him to go home in a very stressed voice. Later I asked my DM how he thought I was playing said I was nice yet still in character, also asked another player they said the same thing neither had problems. So what do I do? I enjoy the way I play my character but it's causing to much party discourse. Do I just take one for the team and change my characters opinions and actions or do I keep playing him the way he is? Playing the way he is could be bad for the group out of game considering last night the other player threatened our cleric out of game saying ""if you don't shut up I'm going to go over this table and beat you"" for something the cleric said in game.

""Twin Serpents""  
Adventurers come upon a small jewel box whose outer shell is made of tarnished pewter, a lowly gift, perhaps a tinderbox lost by a commoner. Upon opening the jewel box, the inside tells a different story: a lavish green satin lining with slots for two rings, but there is only one inside. A beautiful silver scaled ring in the shape of a snake eating its own tail, with an emerald eye. A medium wisdom check will reveal the words scribed inside  
*""Without my twin, I am worthless  
For a win, your quarrel shall bear this  
As long as he's strong,  
He won't suffer long,  
For his greed he will find he was careless.""*   
Upon discovering this, you can make a check to reveal that with the ring's match, this ring would be very valuable, but without it, just a trinket, not worth a GP. Perhaps it can have a mind of its own, asking you to put the ring on the finger of one of the adventurers. When they do, the silver snake uncoils and slithers down the finger, to the wrist of the bearer. It then transforms into a shackle, closely chained(a short enough chain to have the bearer bend over)to a very heavy pewter ball, looking much like the box it came in. Magic casters cannot cast magic, fighters lose that hand to a d6 bludgeoning weapon, the ball and chain. My computer is dying so I'll tell you more tomorrow!"	t5_2qwdo	True

1371873916.0	1gu80m	A whole can of worms [3.5]	ZXfrigginC	14	6	22	"Let me set the tone right off the bat, I'm not celebrating my experience playing DnD with my friends.

When we looked at the Pathfinder ruleset between myself and the original appointed DM, we agreed that we should stick to the core races and classes so that it wouldn't be too tough for PCs to play and for the DM to DM.

Since then, we had to switch it to another DM; personally, for me, the experience has been getting worse.

The original DM went on to do mid-campaign research and start making characters out of [this clause.](http://www.d20srd.org/indexes/monstersAsRaces.htm) The DM had been okaying each character, not knowing the full extent of what the monster PC could do. His current character takes [2](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/halfCelestial.htm) [templates.](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/halfDragon.htm) We all already had a problem with his first monster PC, and now I think they are choosing to ignore what's going on.

The current DM has been writing his own story, which is admirable enough. The big problem I got with him right now is him having his own PC, which is a custom piece that isn't based on anything. Apparently, he nerfed it a lot to ""stop our bitching"" but he still has very high stats (30+ in INT and Cha, 24 in 2 others, less in Wis). To him, his really high stats aren't a big deal. I, for one, know for a fact he is completely full of shit right now since standard PCs can only get as high as 26 just to start (4d6 rolls coming to all 6's plus racial), and you're lucky to have a stat of 20 after adjustments.

On top of all of this, DM original has continued to find resources and read them, with the intent of implementing them mid-campaign to reroll a more appropriate non-core PC. There was already a huge can of worms opened up when the two of them decided to let monsters be usable as PCs. More rules have been opened since then, and it's getting out of hand.

The worst part about all of that, of course, is that I'm the only one who seems to care at this point. I've spoken up plenty, and the results have been less than acceptable. I've been bullied, ignored, or...I guess...filibustered into letting it all slide.

I plan on going to our session tomorrow, but I can't keep this up. I've done my best to have patience with it, but it feels like it's only getting worse.

Of course, complaining on the internet doesn't do good if you don't get an understanding as to whether you're right or wrong, so feel free to tell me whether I'm right about the DnD experience getting way out of hand or if I'm wrong and just getting really pissy like the DM thinks.

Left out something important: We switched from PF to DnD 3.5."	t5_2qwdo	True

Basically there was a riddle our DM made that he wanted us to solve. Basically involving the deities if the DND world. My wizard was able to do an Arcana check and learn the ""password"" for the first part of said riddle. After doing some re-arranging I was able to melt a door with a magical mirror(like in Zelda!). Then stopped by 5 war forged was asked the riddle again. Thinking nothing of it I said the ""password"" again only to be attacked. After he explained it didn't work because he was looking for the 3 gods in the riddle. I was a little upset because although I did in fact do an Arcana check, I was unaware that these were in fact ""religious"" symbols we were using. I don't see how my character would not ""know"" these are religious, also being trained in that. Our DM basically made no mention of it, and I feel like he forced the fight. The doors instantly lock behind us. Being an eldarin I was in ""fuck this I'm going live at least once mode"" and attempted to feystep back to the other side of the door, too which my DM simply said I couldn't do. -_- 

Sorry for the wall of text, but am I overthinking this? Or did my   DM not give enough info and force a fight? I ask this as a DM but I'm not sure if what I'm saying should have happened was even a possibility.

   I DID include a TL;DR, though, but you really should read all of it or at least skim.

------------------------------------

This will be the first campaign I've ever DM-ed over, and because I never do things half-assed, I chose not to go with a simple dungeon, but a campaign. And not a quickly-planned campaign either, a seriously thought through set of linking dungeons that will stretch across multiple game sessions.
   Seriously, I've been thinking this through in DETAIL. This will be by far the most ambitious and in-depth campaign I've ever been a part of.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a group of six high-level players, mostly non-standard races. I've played with them for a while now, and we agreed to take turns as DM, so I've paid attention to how they think so I could determine how best to work my campaign.
   One guy, a half-fiend, was especially annoying. He was extremely clever with creating his character, and as a result, is way overpowered. He can do stuff that I've never seen done, like nuke an army of twelve orcs and kill all of them. With one hit.
   He doesn't leave much for the rest of us to do, so I've created a very long campaign designed not to KILL him, though that was tempting, but to neutralize magic use and focus on melee.

--------------------------------------------
**THE GAME PLAN**: 
The final boss is a half-fiend-half-dragon who has massed a group of half-elves, half-orcs, humans, elves, and dwarves to target a nearby city, specifically, the magic users, specifically, the ones who use magic as a weapon. The boss (Whom I've decided to call Scarlett Johanson(Because absolutely no good reasons)) wants to be the ONLY attack magic user. SO, using her ridiculous diplomacy, she's convinced all these groups to work together. 
   Because of this intent, she's set anti-magic fields throughout the map, preventing all damage-causing spells (NOT HEALING OR SUMMONING) from being cast and given all the enemy fighters in the areas NOT covered magic-resisting armor and healers. The different races are still in seperate camps, and each is led by its own mini-boss, with the exception of the half-elves who are just the scouts outside the entrance. I made this campaign to be tough on ALL the characters, not JUST for this one guy, so each character has his/her own fighting style/thinking patterns directly opposed in one area or another, or by the literally dozens of traps laid through the whole map. 
The map is seriously huge. I was drawing out plans on graph paper, marking where the traps are hidden, and I've realized that the 24X30 board will be changed a minimum of twice, three times depending on how I think we're managing partway through the first. All enemy characters will almost all be prestige classed and have magic items, the most powerful of which will also have a curse on it, specifically against the person it's most suited to, undetectable until the situation arised where it's useful.
   There are traps ALL OVER, hidden well and in places these guys will never expect, with effects they haven't planned for. Again, this is true for ALL of them, I'm NOT targeting the magic user. Well, not him SPECIFICALLY.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any advice? 
    I feel like we definitely CAN do this, with enough time, it's definitely going to be a multiple night thing, but I've never played something THIS in-depth and really want to try it. 

-------------------------

*TL;DR*
Want to send a 'fuck-you' to an asshat half-fiend player, give the group the most epic/mind-bendy campaign they've ever experienced at the same time. 
 Tips would be nice.

Although I'm not the DM, my house will be host to a D&amp;D game played weekly to which I, and a few others, will be new players. I'll be fashioning a 1.5x2m whiteboard into a tempoary table, which is apparently an ideal playing surface.

It's pen and paper based, none of that ""app crap"" apparently. But my question is regarding the dice.

I lose things. At least once a week, I lose the coffee I meant to be drinking. As much as I'd love to buy a nice set of dice, I know I'll never find them again after the first game.

1) How important is a good set of a dice to the game, and what set should I get anyway?

2) I'm a programmer/gamedev, and I've got loads of experience with the windows phone. So I want to knock up a quick and dirty physics driven dice simulator in an evening for our groups use. Would such an idea have a negative social impact on the game? 

3) Should idea 2 be invalid, should I just buy lots of extra, cheap dice?

4) Best place to buy D&amp;D stuff?

Thanks for taking to time to read this. If you didn't, I wish you well anyway.


-------------------

Edit:

Making a dice app will get me accused of cheating in a big serious game outside my circle of freinds. However always carrying a digital set on my phone will be handy as a backup, or for impromptu games so I'm still gonna make it.

But real dice, the nicely decorated elven or otherwise dice can't really be beat. My freind has a gold plated metal D20, and it's just nice. An app, physics driven or not can't really get that, but it can still be of use. I'm motivated to make it, but I'm gonna have to buy a nice set of dice, some peices and a notebook as a D&amp;D kit no matter what.

SilverCinders	8	1	14	I'm making a human fighter and I am currently working on her back story. Her great grand father was a dwarf, mostly to explain her looks, and because of this I have asked my DM to let me put a little dwarven flair in my character build. I requested that she be able to speak dwarven and that she could see a little better in the dark, I was thinking 10ft of dark vision. My DM acquiesced to the dwarven language but is adamant about the dark vision. I would love honest responses, my DM is a redditor and i think this may help, am I asking for something unreasonable  or he being too strict?

Unfortunately, we didn't do this 2 months ago and we're all going away to school just as things are starting to get interesting. We're definitely more than willing to just wait it out a few months until the next break, but we'd like to just figure out how to do it online. We were thinking Google+ because you can have group video chats, but I was also curious if there is any software to support long distance D&amp;D?

Things I'm talking about is any sort of software to just make it so everybody can see whats going on at once. I think that if the DM (myself) was just telling everyone what's going on, then it would really break the immersion and make it a lot less fun. It would be a great start to have some sort of virtual dice rolling software where EVERYONE could see the results. And what would really be fantastic is some sort of software that allowed everyone to see the dungeon tiles on screen, including character positions. This sounds pretty technical to me, but definitely possible. So, what software have people found help with ""online"" D&amp;D? What other advice do you have on doing a long distance game? OR would it be best to just wait until we can all hang out again? Thanks, all!

I'm hoping someone could help shed some light on the proper ways to play Shaman in 4e. I have a player at my table who rolled one and I've never DM'ed an adventure where I've had a Shaman as one of the PC's.

Here's what happened on the last get together: 

he casts his bear spirit and sends it towards these deadlock wights that were on the board. The only thing I could do is attack the spirit bear, but he has to be hit for 11 (10 +1/2 level) or more to go away, in that case the shaman takes 6 damage (5+ ¬Ω level) and the bear disappears, then as a minor he just throws the bear right back out on the board again

Also I would have to shift my monsters away in order to not generate an opportunity attack, so it came down to the PC's shooting ranged spells/crossbows etc and this bear spirit soaking up all the damage, then when I managed to shift away and move down the board, he called his spirit back with a minor and replaced him right back at the monsters again with another minor, then used his standard to attack.

I‚Äôm just trying to figure out if hes playing him wrong.. it sure seems game breaking because everything is geared for level 2 PC‚Äôs and I can't for the most part generate an 11 HP hit on one attack. And I don‚Äôt want to just drop a brute down just to kill this bear but I may have to so he starts thinking about how to play it.

""this is too soon."" the midwife cried. 
The woman again screamed out in agony. 
""save the child."" she muttered in between staggered breathing. Midwife commanded the woman to push and as she gave the final push with all she had left in her, the child gave its first cry. 
""it's a girl!"" midwife exclaimed
""Bella Donna, she shall be called."" the woman said as she took her last breath and collapsed on the icy ground. Midwife held the baby as it cried and shivered. Thum Thum Thum Thum Thum Thum Thum. The drums continued in the rapt of four.

""This child's eyes are clouded! She holds the gift of the oracles. Oh child, born under the sign of the moon to the sounds of bitter war, you shall bring great things to our lands!"" Thum Thum Thum Thum. The sounds of drums faded into the night.

Simmering in the sounds of the nearby battle, she thought to herself, ""the battle rages on but I smell only defeat for my people.""
She looked at the aged midwife with her cloudy eyes and said aloud,"" we must go and hide. Somethin is approaching""
""I am too elderly to travel Bella. You must go, trust your inner self. Go.""
Bella donna paused a moment, ""But midwife I cannot leave you. You raised me."" she cantered. 
""my child, I have lived long and well. And you have much in the world to do, child of the moon."" Midwife replied ""you have grown into a suitable young changeling, eyes of blue, hair of white, your eyes are cloudy and vision is poor of the world, but of the other your eyes are pure. You have heard the same sounds of war since you were born. It is time, my dear, for you to hear the sounds beyond this relm.""
"" I will go then. Only to return with support and bring aide to our people so you too can sleep with out the thrumming of the drums."" Bella Donna said with a gleam in her frosty eyes.

A group of guys invited me to play D&amp;D. I volunteered to play a healer (something I did in online games). They all picked melee classes, including a pure defense/taunting tank and an assassin rogue. I'm thinking I should play a pure healing cleric but I want to consider my other options. Is there any other healing classes that could keep a group like this alive?

I've been getting back into campaigning after awhile, and I personally am not a fan of it. The only people I have spoken to who really enjoy it are people who started with 4th. I'm looking for a devil's advocate here, I guess. Is there anyone out there who played 1st-3.5, transferred over to 4th, and really enjoyed it?

1320582128.0	m2bsd	So.  Fourth Edition likes and dislikes...	Sockeater	6	2	8	"So my group is running a fourth edition campaign right now, and we've made a few modifications to rules we felt were changed wrongly.  I was just wondering if anyone else out there shared the same feeling on some of these rules?  Or maybe changed others? Or left them the same?  OK, so this is really just an excuse to get a conversation going on the good and bad of fourth edition, maybe get the opinions of people who have played longer than us (I started in 3rd edition, so I don't know what the previous ones were like).
* Critical hits and misses.  No punishment for crit misses? Really? Those are some of the best moments in our games, that split second of ""oh shit, that's a 1, oh god oh god oh fuck we're all gonna die"". Likewise the adrenaline rush of rolling a 20 and getting a chance at double damage or more.
Alchemists fire.  Maybe we're incompetent, but none of us could find this wonderful wonderful item in the player's handbooks during tonight's game.  HAD to bring it back in. Unbalanced or not, it's just too much fun not to have a collection of these in a bag of holding.  Speaking of which...
They massively reduced the amount a bag of holding can hold.  Why? That's the POINT of a Bag, it holds all the things! We had to correct this grievous error on the part of Wizards.
Multiclassing didn't seem as rewarding to us as it used to be, but maybe with the changed they made to how a class is built and how attacks are done, it's all they could do to balance it? Didn't like it though, so we're trying 3.5 style multiclassing (and I think there might be a reason they changed the way it works.  Holy CRAP does it make OP players when you let them do that!)

My group's overall opinion is that the combat design in 4th edition is improved in terms of simplicity and ease of use.  The focus on character development and roleplaying seems to have diminished quite a bit (though it is nice that we don't need a seperate sheet just for skills, but i do wish some of them were still left in).  We're still toying with it, but what about you all? Did you play it and like it? Did you play it and see potential? Or did you play it, find it revolting, and return to the older methods?

OP? Was looking to balance. Looking to make the mace a low-level holy weapon that saps a player's energy but can kinda turn the tide.

Next would be the orb, an evil multifaceted globular gem that enhances a spell, making a powerful caster. Necrotic damage is because of the evil necessary to cast it, stealing a little of your soul and your friend's. 

Lastly would be the crown of a king of thieves. Through the rounds of being invisible, you get pretty sapped. Basically you get really dizzy just putting the crown on, so that's how you lose some dexterity.

1370639349.0	1fvze4	Looking For A New Actual Play Podcast Maybe? Why Not Prymecast?	Dndpryme	12	6	1	"Hello again, Reddit! When last I posted, it was to introduce you to my group and I's YouTube channel, D&amp;D: Pryme. After discussion here and in other subreddits and discussion amongst ourselves, we have concluded that, at least for the time being, our sessions lend themselves better to a podcast format.

And so to podcasting we have moved, and with the move, a new home. Allow me to introduce you to www.prymecast.com, the new home of the D&amp;D: Pryme actual play podcast.

If you‚Äôre brand new to us, allow me an opportunity to explain what we do.

We are five very good friends who have been gaming together and independently for a very long time. This campaign is relatively new, having started in March of this year. I am the DM, and the party is composed of four players: a gnome barbarian named Bui, a half-orc druid named Throg, a human wizard named Gage, and a human monk named Nerys.

We play D&amp;D and try to tell a compelling story, have fun, and be entertaining. Sometimes we fail at one or all of these things, but occasionally we succeed. We play using the 3.5 ruleset, and our campaign is set on my homebrew world of Pryme. Every episode is roughly half an hour long. I cannot guarantee our discussions remain family-friendly, nor can I guarantee that we are able to stay on topic at all times. Frequently we will divulge in discussion regarding other nerdy hobbies‚Äîtv shows, video games, card games, and so forth. There‚Äôs even a delightful discussion about shemales at one point. Something for everyone, I suppose. While there is plenty of combat involved, first and foremost we are interested in crafting, telling, and sharing a compelling story with each other and with you. As the DM, I enjoy creating a vibrant, living world for my players to explore, and as my players, they in turn enjoy ruining all my best laid schemes. The combination creates said compelling story, however, and I think the one we‚Äôre weaving is good enough to share.

We are dedicated role-players more interested in the story than in min-maxxing or bashing dungeon doors. We think that focusing on the narrative lends itself naturally to a storytelling setting, and that it would make listening to us a thing that might be considered enjoyable to some.

Now hopefully you will bear with me as I acclimate myself to the new site and the new format, but once we get comfortable I would like to start an content upload schedule that will look something like this:

**MONDAY:** D&amp;D: Pryme Actual Play podcast. The bread and butter of our operation. The current episodes are half hour long but eventually this will become hour-long installments of our ongoing campaign.

**TUESDAY:** The World of Pryme. This will be a weekly blog entry detailing the various places, people, and creatures of Pryme so that you, the viewer, can better understand the world in which the players reside.

**WEDNESDAY:** Side Quests Podcast. Every Wednesday, join PJ (the DM) and Kaylan (Throg the druid) on a side quest out of the world of Pryme and into the real world. For an hour to an hour-and-a-half, we will discuss all things relevant to the average nerd, from video games to television to card games to books. We will share our insight and ignorance with you.

**THURSDAY:** Loremasters of Pryme. Like The World of Pryme, Loremasters of Pryme is a weekly blog entry that will go into the history, politics, religion, and arcane practices that the citizens of Pryme follow.

**FRIDAY:** The second D&amp;D: Pryme Actual Play podcast upload for the week.

By all means, come check us out! If you like what you see and you hear, journey with us. We'd love to have you along.

The solution: I ride on his shoulders. In fact, I could stand on his head if I wanted. When I mentioned this, he told me he was going to buy a top-hat, to which I replied that I would buy a top-hat and a monocle.

TL;DR: I would like to see your examples of a tiny-sized Minotaur standing on the head of an Astral Deva, both holding top-hats (as though just removed), and the Minotaur wearing a monocle. Those are the only bounds.

About two years ago, I bought Neverwinter Nights 2, on the notion that it was an interesting game. I played the single player for a bit, fairly fun, reminded me of KotoR in a sense, though I never finished the main campaign so I set it aside for awhile. At this point, I'm completely unfamiliar with DnD rules and concepts. Eventually, I realised there was a semi-active multiplayer community tucked in, so I played around there for awhile. I was server hopping for a couple of weeks on roleplay servers, doing this and that, having some fun and whatnot. Eventually, I decided I wanted to get a bit serious, so I joined a ""hardcore"" roleplay server that takes DnD rules seriously.

The players and admins were very understanding of the fact that I still know LITERALLY nothing about DnD, so that was nice of them. Long story short, after months roleplaying with them on their server My interest piqued enough that I wanted to try DMing, which they allowed me to. I wanted to be a DM because while the rules of DnD do not interest me that much, I'd love to make a story within this setting (I'm a writer, I like doing it although I'm nothing much, haha).

Though I'm facing some very big concerns with DMing. The thought of all eyes and ears watching me craft out an elaborate story is terrifying and nerve-racking, and I'm very much so afraid of making a fool out myself. The worries and concerns I'm having are so great that the players are mocking and condescending me for caring so much. I don't know though. These guys have been playing DnD for years, when I was in middle school. They're fucking hardcore. I think they're just not used to seeing someone so green that's expressing interest in this sort of thing.

My one big problem is, like I said above, not knowing what kind of scenario / narrative I'd craft for the players. My thought was, ""Why would they bother with me when there's dozens of other more qualified DM's (Mind you, I have completely zero experience DMing) ?"", which they quickly dismissed as being a baby. Dunno, maybe I was being a baby, I'm not just crazy on the whole ""making myself look like a fool"" thing.

One solution I could think of was having someone Co-DM for me. Now, I'm not blindly asking for help, by all means no, but a co-DM can relieve a lot of the stress and worries I have of being a terrible DM. The other solution is to... Just forget about being a DM. Just continue on roleplaying. I don't know though, I feel like this is a good first step to familiarize myself with DnD, and it has to come one way sooner or later.

What do you suggest I do? I know this is a really stupid question and all, and feel free to call me a faggot or whatever, but I didn't really know where to ask. So thanks, and sorry, in advance.

I'd rather not post the community's web page, but I will if it's necessary and people insist.

(Also, NWN2 uses the 3.5e edition. I don't really know what that means, but a friend told me to throw that in, haha.))

1343870592.0	xjelf	Need some inspiration for a new campaign/setting. (new to dm'ing and with new players!)	Spongi	6	0	3	"So it's been about 13 years since I played.  I want to say 3rd edition had just came out back when I last played.   

I just picked up the core books 4e + a bunch of assorted books for $50 from some guy on craigslist :-D  

I have a group who is interested, a mix of adults and kids.  The kids range from 6-11 and the adults range from 32-48.    I think maybe one of the other guys has some D&amp;D experience but the rest are new.   

I've never DM'd before so any tips would be great.   

For an initial story here's what I've come up with so far.    

A pioneer town/colony has sent reports back to the kingdom of troubles.  The kingdom hires a group and sends them out to investigate and deal with the issues.   This explains how the group got together and I'll let each person come up with their own motivations for coming.   

The pioneer town is set out in a seemingly peaceful area that has been abandoned for many years.   The town is being built on the ruins of an old small town.    Strange things have been happening such as dissapearances, strange noises, unusually aggressive wild animals and shit really starts to hit the fan once the players show up.   

They eventually find out that this isn't the first colony here.  About 20 years ago the first pioneer group mysteriously disappeared.  

The original town (prior to the first colony) slaughtered a group of peaceful tribal people who lived nearby in the wilderness and their sole surviving shaman placed a curse on the land before dying.    They'll find clues to this and eventually piece it together, then they have to break the curse.   

In the mean time they have to deal with the effects of the curse which steadily ramp up in power.  Starting out with diseased crops, undead in the graveyard, animal attacks and hopefully I can get some inspiration for more things from you guys :-D  

In between weird curse things, they'll have to help out with mundane stuff like assisting the blacksmith in finding ore, helping find food for the villagers, finding lost livestock and such and many of those will lead to little adventures and random encounters.

We cannot comprehend what the stats will be for the Wolf. He is a level 2 druid. We get confused on the HD, BAB, etc, of the wolf. 

To our understanding HD is Hit Die, which is the amount of health you get each level. A druid gets a HD of 1d8. Also Animals do not get levels i think but instead they get HD which is more health for the animal.

Well if the clerics HD is d8 then what does clerics level +2 mean? Also in the monster manual it says advancement 9-10 HD for example. If HD is something like d12 then what does 9-10 HD mean?

1373242301.0	1htxs8	"Please help me refine this ""Beginners Guide to the various editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons""?"	daren_sf	10	6	9	"You‚Äôre entering the land of D&amp;D at a very odd time. Wizards of the Coast (WotC) are pouring almost all of their resources into the 5th Edition (5e or ‚ÄúD&amp;D Next‚Äù) and very little new material is being released for 4e.  

I found this site‚Äôs page: [A NOMENCLATURE OF D&amp;D EDITIONS](http://www.thealexandrian.net/creations/misc/edition-nomenclature.html) to be a valuable resource in understanding the editions. It‚Äôs very handy in that it also shows the published covers of the rulebooks so you know what to look for. 

**0e (Original D&amp;D)** is available at www.dndclassics.com in watermarked PDF format. It started with the [Basic Rules](http://www.dndclassics.com/product/110274/D%26D-Basic-Set-Rulebook-%28Basic%29), then moved onto the [Expert Rules](http://www.dndclassics.com/product/110792/D%26D-Expert-Set-Rulebook-%28Basic%29). That‚Äôs the BE of BECMI (Basic, Expert, Companion, Masters and Immortals), a set of rules published to cover Level 1 and above. You can find of the rules for BECM in the [Rules Cyclopedia](http://www.dndclassics.com/product/17171/D%26D-Rules-Cyclopedia-%28Basic%29?it=1). However remember that they‚Äôre just the rules, with little information on how to play. (So if you‚Äôre new to the game you‚Äôll at least need the full Basic rulebook and the Cyclopedia.) The fate of Immortals has yet to be decided...

**1e (Advanced D&amp;D)** was just recently reprinted as premium hardbacks, so no PDFs are available. You can find them online by searching for ‚ÄúD&amp;D 1st Edition‚Äù and you‚Äôll need the *Players Handbook* (PHB), the *Dungeon Masters Guide* (DMG) and the *Monster Manual* (MM), also known collectively as the ‚ÄúCore Books‚Äù. They‚Äôve also been reprinted as premium hardbacks *Unearthed Arcana* and a series of adventure modules entitled *Against the Slave Lords*.

**2e (Advanced D&amp;D v2)** has also been recently reprinted as premium hardbacks, and again you can find the Core Books online by searching for ‚ÄúD&amp;D 2nd Edition‚Äù. 

*NOTE:* The 2e MM is called *Monstrous Manual*. 

**3e (D&amp;D v3)** was released in 2000 and can be a bit hard to find as they haven‚Äôt yet been reprinted nor are they available in PDF format. 

*NOTE:* The 3e MM is now back to *Monster Manual*, and there the title stays.

**3.5e (D&amp;D v3.5)** was released in 2003 and premium reprints are available online by searching for ‚ÄúD&amp;D 3.5‚Äù. 

*CAUTION:* Amazon lists both ‚ÄúPremium Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3.5 Player‚Äôs Handbook with Errata by Wizards RPG Team (Sep 18, 2012)‚Äù and ‚ÄúDungeons &amp; Dragons Players‚Äô Handbook: Core Rulebook I, v. 3.5 by Wizards Team (Jul 1, 2003)‚Äù so make sure to search carefully!

*NOTE:* It was at this point in time that Wizards of the Coast decided to release the core rules for D&amp;D 3.5 under the Open Game License. Auspiciously to allow for easier adventure module creation, and that did happen, but what also happened was...

**3.75e (Pathfinder)** was spawned by Paizo. The 3.5e (edition) rules are available free online at [Paizo PRD](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/) and at http://www.d20srd.org. 

*NOTE:* Paizo, on their website, states: 
&gt; ‚ÄúThe *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game* is released under the Open Game License, meaning the core rules that drive the Pathfinder RPG system are available to anyone to use for free under the terms of the OGL. This compendium of rules, charts, and tables contains all of the open rules in the system, and is provided for the use of the community of gamers and publishers working with the system.

&gt; This compendium is NOT the official *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game*! Players interested in a user-friendly introduction to the Pathfinder system will want to purchase the complete *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook* and the *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*, which comes complete with more than 350 monsters to menace your player characters.‚Äù

**4.0e (D&amp;D v4.0)** was released by Wizards of the Coast in 2008 and represents a major reworking of the rules. This is the last released version of D&amp;D and you can find the Core Books (three volumes each for the PHB, DMG and MM) online by searching for ‚ÄúD&amp;D 4.0‚Äù. You can also check out free material for getting started with 4e on the WotC website under [Learn to Play](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Feature.aspx?x=new/learntoplay).

2014 will mark the 40th anniversary of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and to that end WotC are reworking the rules with the noble goal of uniting *all* editions of D&amp;D by creating a core game that can then be modified by rules modules to allow any style (i.e. edition) of role playing your group desires. This [was announced](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4ll/20120109) in January of 2012. In January of 2013 WotC published these four articles: [D&amp;D Next Goals, Part One](http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4ll/20130107); [D&amp;D Next Goals, Part Two](http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4ll/20130114); [D&amp;D Next Goals, Part Three](http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4ll/20130122) and [D&amp;D Next Goals, Part Four](http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4ll/20130128). 

**5e (D&amp;D Next)** is currently being publicly play tested and you can sign up for free at www.dndnext.com. Then download the PDF-based rules and test out the Next edition for yourself. (Including five adventure modules.) The R&amp;D team has publicly stated that the email survey you receive is the #1 form of feedback for them. So make sure to fill it out. WotC has stated that this is the largest public play test of any game in history. 

For more specific details on the differences between editions please see [Choosing an Edition](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/wjio3/resource_guide_choosing_an_edition/) over at /r/dnd or you can also check out [Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons) on Wikipedia.

If you want to see how the game is currently played (by masters of the game) check out ‚ÄúAcquisitions Inc.‚Äù on www.youtube.com. The 2012 version is D&amp;D Next, the previous years (back to 2010) are 4.0e.

----------

This will hopefully be added to the sidebar of this subreddit as a handy starting point for new players. In the couple of months I've been here the question of editions comes up A LOT.

I'm hoping to refine this *Beginners Guide* with your awesome input!

NOTE: heard back from /u/Ziggurattt and the Moderator is willing to add this to the sidebar of this subreddit once it's been refined. Thanks Ziggurattt!

They seem to take a long time with us.  There are 4 PCs, Cleric, Wizard, Rogue, and Paladin and an average encounter usually takes us about 1-2 hours to complete.  That's just an even XP level fight.  I was wondering if this is normal?  On a related note, what can I do as a DM to help speed this up?

My group tends to like the travelling around playing detective part more than the battles which is fun, but it makes it a lot more work on me.  Usually if we play for 4-5 hours we'll first do a lot of things involving skill checks (such as getting information from people, travelling to places, exploring a city, avoiding traps in a dungeon, etc), I'll usually throw in two or three puzzles into that for them to solve, and we'll do that for 2-2.5 hours.  After that, they'll wind up in a combat encounter.  After the battle we'll do a quick wrap up of what went down and what loot they got.  We'll then maybe play for another 20-30 minutes to get some of their questions answered from the info they've collected by defeating the battle, then call it quits for the day.

The group is made up of four girls which could be why they have a preference to the exploring rather than fighting, but they do enjoy the fight and really feel good about themselves when they defeat the monsters.  So any tips on how I can get more battles in for them and make it enjoyable still?"	t5_2qwdo	True

1336089444.0	t5z45	Magical rune effect ideas?	ss5gogetunks	5	1	13	"So hey guys. For the several boss encounters in my campaign (either 4, 5, or 6 depending on how long I decide and whether I have one in each of my 5 nations as well as in the abandoned empire) I want to have small rifts in space-time that transport the PCs into small areas with runes on the floors. These runes would do different things depending on what they stand on. As it stands, I've got a few ideas for this, but I'd like a lot more ideas.

Some of the examples I have are Phantom Chasm - fall prone on entrance of square, Idiotic Bravery - +2 attack and damage but -2 defenses while in square, Phantom Spikes - deals damage, and teleportation squares, as well as symbols that slide the target a number of squares.

thing is though, I want to have a few unique ones for each nation, corresponding to the source of magic that nation draws from. My ~~four~~ five nations are Ioun the psionic nation, Mythallir the arcane nation, Vannekk the primal nation, Eleram the divine nation, and Vertal, the martial nation. Then a central abandoned capitol that would combine the effects of all of these.

Edit: The players are actually from the psionic nation, and we're epic tier, if that matters to your idea

1367575542.0	1dm0li	I think you guys would enjoy this Paladin	Spooferfish	7	2	2	"So some friends and I have been playing a campaign since July, and after a few characters I've settled with my current guy, who's a Paladin of Freedom (variant that's based on being CE). The party he's in is highly optimized, but running a 4d6 roll system (1's get replaced) he managed to get two 18's, which considering he's an Aasimar made it so his Wis and Cha are both 20's. 

Basically, he's set as the ultimate in anti-evil. His greatest focus is ensuring that everyone is kept free and allowed to make their own choices, as long as these choices don't directly harm others. That's why he gets such a huge kick from destroying undead: to make something undead is to completely take away its ability to make any choices or decisions, controlling it to your whims after the body should be resting.

But, considering the party was not only super optimized and containing a few evil characters, he was not having a good time. After running into a major port city that happened to have demons controlling portions of it (they did nothing to him since he's immune to compulsion effects, and that's what the demons thrive on) he decided to leave the party, find a job (5/gold a day and free lodging/food!) and I took a real life break. During his leave from the party, he didn't want to get rusty, so I asked my DM if I could find some place in town to get further training. He cracked a huge smile.

In town, there's a guard patrol that's led by a woman simply named the Lieutenant. From what I understand, she's a level 12 character who's currently an ECL 18 or so, and is just a regular human.

The guy who trained her became my paladin's trainer.

Now, none of this came for free. In game, I took a 5 month break (3 month out of game) as he went through training. When I came back, I had to roll a 75% of surviving the guard training, and then roll 4 percentiles to see if I survived the training of the master. If I rolled a 25% on ONE of the 4 rolls, my character would have been destroyed. 

Having made the rolls, I got my bonuses. First, the stats: Each of my stats was reworked, with a d20 roll for each. If the roll was below a 15, I rerolled. My current stats with race mods are 20/20/16/16/18/20 - not too shabby for a paladin. 

I lost my ability to use any armor, opting instead for a tunic and pants.

I gained my wisdom to my AC, as well as a +5 deflection bonus (rolled to see how high it was, near maxed), putting my AC at 24 with nothing on (that's TAC 24 as well). 

I have constant lighting reflexes, with saves of 13/14/11 after bonuses.

And, lastly, at 5 I took the Sword of Celestia feat instead of getting the mount due to the environment we constantly find ourselves (having a good-aligned masterwork magic weapon that I can bring out 11 times a day and dismiss as a free action is much more useful than a mount, which I'd have issues with morally anyway).

Currently, the guy is about to reach level 7. Tons of flavor (party with two part-devils who sold their souls that I'm constantly having a moral dilemma over) and a god that makes the most fantastic god calls (Hal, the god of wit, humor, charm, and pleasure), and I do believe Farel is very much a tier-2 character right now. Starting next level, I'm going into Fist of Raziel - extra smites and bonuses to all of them, and continued paladin spells and no loss of abilities as my creed stays. 

I can't express how much I love this guy.

P.S. To deal with the optimized party Monster DC's are increased and most of the guys we run into as CR 9-10 right now. It balances out well. "	t5_2qwdo	True

A lengthy description of our party's most recent adventure."	Pleadforj	3	0	4	"Our party of three had just finished killing a stone golem. After collecting Xp we had leveled up near the end of our adventure, our dm usually leveled our characters after adventures making this a very refreshing opportunity. At this moment we all entered level nine, making me a lvl 6 ninja/ lvl 3 shadowdancer. Level 3 shadowdancer, for those not aware, is the opening of the class core features (summon shadow, silent image, rouge talent). I punched ranks and jotted feats, all without notifying the dm of my new summon ability. I wanted to make my leveling seem mundane and unnoticeable. 

Time came to leave the stone golems cave. We soon found ourselves outside in a light snow. Suddenly, a major plot npc, a green dragon, is plummeted towards the stone courtyard before us. His neck broken and belly slit. Soon after the impact, a pristine white dragon touches down and reveals the scars of a formidable battle. He then utters something in dragonic, which our party's linguist translates ""Witness the power of the north wind"". Roll for initiative. We all roll poorly and the white dragon unleashes an ice breath cone (50ft cone). This was enough to send our party back within the cave for a heal and buff collaboration. The cave entrance is fortunately narrow enough to keep the dragon outside. This is when I reveal my shadow summon. I turn to my friends and ask, ""want to see something cool?"" I create an imagery for my group. The torchlight of the cavern creates a soft living shadow off my character which then takes life of it's own and rises from the stone floor. This pumps up the party something fierce. 

We slowly approach the cave entrance after some character buffing. The dragon has dispersed since our retreat. A quick party perception check reveals that he is perched atop a small mountain about 200ft away and appears observant, but hesitant. A quick party huddle, and we have a plan. I use silent image to create an image of a still beating heart within the dead green dragon. Our party linguist/tank then belts out ""Come and finish your deed foul lizard,"" in dragonic while making an intimidate check, success. The white dragon swoops down and rips the head clean off the green dragon, forcing a will save on the party, our dm smiles at us and says, ""nice plan guys, I love the creativity, but make your save throws"".

The other two party members make their saves but I fail, I'm not too concerned because our party cleric is an ailment healing pro. We use this opportunity to flank the dragon and ground him. I use greater feint an let the party go at him. The summoned shadow uses corporeal touch (1d6 strength DMG (touch)) and lands a 4. With 4 strength DMG, 4 bleed DMG, and 1 dex DMG (ninja skill, pressure points), the dm gives our party a rewarding look, frustration. 

He uses this opportunity to fly away. We make a pattern of making a fortified line of people to provoke a sweep attack from the dragon. In the front of this line we place the shadow, bracing for a touch counter attack. We effectively weaken the dragon 1d6 strength DMG every sweep, eventually reducing him to 1 str causing him to plummet to the courtyard. I turn to our party tank and calmly say, ""he's all yours Clive"". Our tank asks the dragon if he has any last words. The white dragon mutters, ""you are weak,"" and lets in a deep breath readying for a final ice blast. Roll for initiative. Our tank rolls higher and pierces the dragons throat. We looked over at the green dragon and decided he deserve better. Our party then dug him a shallow grave and planted a tree in his chest.

At this point the dm called off the snow and the tree grew at an accelerated rate, blossoming into a great white oak. Our party and dm were fucking speechless. It was the best campaign I have ever played."	t5_2qwdo	True

1346720479.0	zb6z1	Playing a Vampire	Aeviaan	4	1	10	"So... My college group will be starting a second, larger group of D&amp;D relatively soon. I will be playing in this one, instead of DMing, and I would like to start play as a Sorcerer (Necromancer).

Questions for this, are Necromancer/Conjurer mixes good, when they focus on Necromancy as the primary magic? I'd like to think so, but looking at the spells I'm not 100%. 

At some point, I would like my character to become a vampire. Is there anyway to have her become a vampire that still feels as strong and dangerous as a vampire should, but not overshadow or make other characters look/feel bad? Do the glaring weaknesses (runnign water, stakes, no entry into places where I haven't been invited, hated by people who find me out, and, of course, sunlight) cover up the massive bonuses (good natural armor, good spell casting, lots of resistances and general damage resistance, 5HP per turn recovery, able to transfer forms, etc.)?

To start off this is my Eladrin Vampire character named Zanian von Rossenburg

a.	He is the second son of the current head of the Rossen clan. They are a clan of vampires that have controlled politics, the military and the black market from behind the scenes. Due to him being the second born his older brother has been expected to be the next heir. For years he lived in his brother‚Äôs shadow as the ‚Äúsecond born‚Äù he received the same teaching and training, but his brother was always treated better than him even by the servants. He had an immense hatred for his older brother; it seemed that he was better than him at everything. Sword fighting, studies, diplomatic means, and even hunting his prey. There was one person whom he loved more than anything else in the world, one of the servants named Halea. She treated him special, even better than she did his father. One day he awoke to trumpets blazing outside, He looked out of his window to see Halea being prepared to be executed. With his entire family watching‚Ä¶with his brother at the head. He headed down as fast as he could to stop it. He made it just in time, right before the execution begun. He interrupted asking what had happened and why wasn‚Äôt he informed. His brother was the one to answer. She was accused of being an assassin who had been planning killing the entire family for years. Zanian refuted the claim and said he had no right to accuse without evidence. His brother merely replied that he could do whatever he wanted since he was the next heir. Zanian was stunned that his parents did nothing to stop this. Zanian made an offer. If one day he came back and was able to defeat his brother that not only would he release Halea but he would also have to give up his position as next in line to the title of heir. His brother agreed whole heartedly and his father showed no opposition. Zanian quickly went to Halea side. Halea thanked him and told him about a gift she had left him in his bedroom. She was taken away to the prison and Zanian went back to his room to find the gift. He found a small box with a not in it proclaiming her love for him and a ring that was engraved with her name in it.

It's been years since I actually tried DMing, and even back then it was just a quest or two to allow the other DMs from the group get a little play time. So I am running a campaign I have had an idea for, for awhile. We did a couple sessions, so we can work out the bugs with me taking over as DM and the players all picking new classes to mess around with.   
Where I need help with is, I am about to do a larger dungeon instead of quick little missions, and I am trying to add all kinds of unique details to it so it just doesn't seem like combat after combat, with an occasional trap thrown in.  
The group is talked into hunting down an artifact by a higher level Fire Elemental who has Azer as his servants/workers. The group needs the Azer help to forge a special magical propertied weapon for further into the campaign. The Elemental explains that some renegade Azer stole his Decanter of Everlasting Water and he will do will perform their task for it's return. What he doesn't mention the renegade Azer now work for a young red dragon. He will eventually explain when they return with the decanter that he doesn't want his name going around when the mother dragon finds out one of her children was murdered. So they go to an old abandoned Volcano and work their way through it, and eventually find a humanoid swimming in the center of the Volcano in a huge pit filled with water, and water flowing down from the roof of the volcano. Whoever tries to retrieve the decanter will fall into the water with the polymorphed dragon, or managed to retrieve it, but they don't hear the humanoid splashing and playing in his pool, to which they learn they are dealing with a dragon.   
2 things I am asking.   
Does like an interesting plot for quest of an adventure, sometimes I start to think it gets a little cheesey. But I really want my party to be like, remember the time we fought the swimming dragon, splashing in his pool.   
2nd I kept thinking that the closer the group gets tunnelwise to the dragon, there would be a lot of steam, from the heat the dragon emits naturally. I was thinking, that might make the players a bit uncomfortable. How should I handle this? Maybe an endurance check like every 10 mins? I was also thinking some sort of speed reduction. Maybe -1 speed if they fail, and eventually when they are right up on the dragon, half speed movement if failed? Also should I just penalize the heavy armor wearing players or should I include the little halfling runt in a robe?   
Sorry to ramble on, everyone that I know who plays DnD is in our group, so I can't really chit chat about ideas with them without feeling like I am going to spoil something.

In the campaign the player characters are going to be super heroes.  I am giving them all a power (think super strength, teleportation, telekinesis, super speed, invisibility, etc...), and telling them they can have what they want, just run it by me.  I told everyone generally to think marvel / xmen / avengers type of deal, but just to give them an idea.  It will be one power that the character can do at will, that will start off weaker but grow as they level up (every 3 levels when they get a feat, power grows).  I am also letting them be gestalt characters as well (combine two classes that level up as one instead of multiclassing...take better hp, better saves, better skills and combine class features).  They are supposed to be bad ass, and I have a story in mind to go with it.  I mean, there are always bigger and badder things in the world of Dungeons and Dragons, that is the glory of it :-)

So the advice I am looking for is for my player character.  I am going to emphasize / force one of them to take on the leadership role, since I am the dm, but I want to play as well.  I am giving everyone first pick of powers and will pick mine last.  Well everyone has given me an idea of what they want, so I have been building a character in my head.

He models a character after after a popular/known figure. The problem is he wants to make it work that way exactly, no matter how unrealistic or heroic they are. Elminster, Drizzt, Van Helsing...

I try to reign him in but he's very exact and unusually persistent. He's young, and I don;t want to sour him to gaming in the process. Talking to him seems to help for a short time, but he reverts. Killing him off with his more dangerous demands (basically, don't save him when he rushes in to the vampire coven at level 4...) does not phase him. He just tries something equally foolhardy in the next character.

I'm playing a pathfinder/3.5 campaign with about 10 other guys. We meet about every week and it is really consistent. We have:
human bard
half elf ranger
changeling monk
halfling druid
dwarf fighter
gnome artificer
kahalstar wilder
warforged barbarian

Its an eberron campaign in which everyone in the group is a part of a secret organization called the distinguished. We are working for a shadowy group that is the secret service of one of the kings in the land. We've done shadow ops, assassinations, setting up secret bases, delivering goods, etc. Pretty basic stuff really.

4 months ago I moved to south korea. I'm still here and i'm doing a play by post with the DM. As i am no longer asscociated with the larger group, I can act as a person to go on a solo mission to get information for the larger group. Its pretty neat. 

In actuality, the DM has asked me to co-DM with him when I return from my year in Korea. My character has been given the task of overthrowing all of the monarchies and governments in eberron (the true, hidden goal of the shadowy organization, unbeknownst to the PC's) and to do it by any means necessary. 

In my 4 months, I've come into ownership of an adult white dragon that has bonded itself to my purposes, knowledge of a dragon cult that thinks i'm a prophet to lead them to victory, and the location of a ""creation forge"" to create a construct army. I don't have all of these things yet, but its feasible that I could. 

I need help thinking of creative ways to feed the group at large misinformation to make them help my goals without their knowledge of it. EX: convincing them through guile and wit that the queen of aundiar isn't really the queen, but a very very sneaky changeling that has her trapped somewhere else.

I created an RPG version of Magic:The Gathering which is loosely based off of Dungeons and Dragons.  Basically the party runs through the campaign, but instead of using D&amp;D combat rules they play a game of Magic against the DM.  The rules are all finished, but I need help choosing a campaign to use.  I haven't played much D&amp;D, but here's what I'm looking for:

* Easy to substitute different monsters for the fights (used a campaign primarily with kobolds last time, but since the encounters use Magic cards it felt wrong since I wasn't just using a deck of all kobolds)
* Lots of opportunities for skill checks.  Different colours relate to different skills (to say, pick a lock, the player would reveal 3 cards off of their deck and need a certain amount of Blue mana symbols) 
* Traps!  Admiral Ackbar would love this game, traps are quite dangerous as they make you start the next encounter with less life - I'd like opportunities to put in quite a few
* around 8-15 encounters (I can alter it slightly by adding or removing some, but this would be around the correct length)
* Uses a map - the last time I had no map, and I feel it might help the party get into it more 
* Outside would be nice -  the last campaign I used was in a cave, and it felt a little constricting
* If it uses dragons, that'd be awesome :)
* Should be fun!  If you have any campaigns you find particularly enjoyable, please let me know even if they don't really fit this criteria

Thanks for the help, reddit!

P.S.  I've already had a couple people ask me for the rules to play this - I'll be posting them when they're finished, if you're interested and would like to know more then please feel free to message me :)

I'm just looking for suggestions to improve what I've got so far. I'm using the Pathfinder rule set but its basically just modified 3.5e.

The PCs are all playing weird classes. We've got a Samurai, Gunslinger, Ninja/Rogue, Summoner/Wizard, and a Berzerker. They are lvl 5.

OK so here is my adventure idea:
The adventure takes place in a city. It's a coastal city that deals heavily in trade with the east (can explain many eastern style PCs and make equipment available to them.). The city has some trouble with pirates and has resorted to hiring Pathfinders(adventurers) to supplement the city guard. 
The PCs will make their way to the Pathfinder Guild and be presented with several contracts but the only one that stands out is one with a reward of 50,000GP to recover a lost item. 

The item is something called the Black Heart Stone and the employer named Saremeth had it stolen from him. The PCs will meet Saremeth.
Saremeth is an Elven Vampir(half vampire) and he wants the stones powers of undeath to use in curing his vampirism. He will use magics to try to hide his Vampir side.

Saremeth has other matters to attend to so has no time to get the stone but has tracked it to a Halfling Rogue with a triangle tattoo around one eye named Thim Harferry.

Thim can be found in the Goblet Half Full Tavern but has sold the stone to an alchemist.

The alchemist is working with the Cult of Orcus(Demon lord of undead) in the town and using the stone to create undead. The stone allows the creation of substances that can turn any living thing undead.
 
The cult wants to use it to create a zombie hoard to overthrow the city and to turn a paladin named Gladen Borrows undead in honor of Orcus for the new year.

Ive created some variant zombies that are able to spread disease and some gas filled varieties. At some point the cult will raise the body of an embalmed saint of Pelor as a mummy and desecrate their church.
PCs will have to stop the zombie outbreaks, track the Skulls(cultists) to their lair, kill them and recover the Black Heart Stone.

Ive also created a Human-hating Half-Orc Barbarian named Grusk who will try to steal the contract from the PCs or find the stone himself.

My problem with this is coming up with ideas for different varieties of enemies other than just humanoids. I guess I could have a magical zoo in town that the cultists target to make some weirdass undead shit.

Any suggestions for improvement?"	t5_2qwdo	True

My question is; if the feat that is granted by the base domain is used as a prerequisite for another feat, and then that domain is substituted out, can you still use the feat that the prerequisite feat allowed you to take?

The specific example is this:

My Wood Elf Cleric of Shevarash has the Elf and War domains. This grants the Weapon Focus (Longbow) feat, and more importantly the Point Blank Shot feat. This then allowed me to take the Rapid Shot and Precise Shot feats. If I substitute out the Elf domain, this obviously stops me from using the Point Blank Shot feat (and the +1 bonus), but do I also lose (or be otherwise unable to use) Precise Shot and Rapid Shot?

The players basically get the option of using them to imbue their weapons or equipment with a dark power that I'm going to custom design, or they can save them, as suggested by an npc that's in the campaign.  The dark shards can later be used to open an arcana locked door that would otherwise be extremely difficult to unlock, all the players train in more combat related stuff like athletics.

I know that we roll dice and have bonuses to add based on our characters (I get that stuff) and I know there is the master who reveals the story as we go, and that it is a largely verbal game.  What I really don't get is how I should design a character.  Knowing that I will be playing Pathfinder, and knowing I don't really know what I'm doing but am very enthusiastic and tend to pick up games very quickly, what would you suggest I go with?

I'm looking at creating my own campaign based on the [Revenge of the 47 Ronin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forty-seven_Ronin); in a regular 4e setting.

Long story short, one regional lord attempted to slay another in the middle of the Emperor's palace. The attempted murderer was forced to commit ritual suicide. His samurai (now ronin, or ""those without a master"") hatched a plan to finish the job that their master started.

I want to have the PC's there at the time of the attempted murder, and be accused as the guilty party. From there, they must blend in and plan for the ""revenge"" by doing a number of preparatory tasks (almost ""sandbox-like""), before the final assault to ""finish the job"".

I've found that wordpress has been useful in organizing my thoughts, and you can see the [work in progress here](http://ddronin.wordpress.com/). Feel free to comment, if you want.

Currently we are playing in a fantasy punk campaign in pathfinder and I am playing a Sorcerer focusing on debuff spells with some damage mixed in. I posted this in /r/dnd but no one had any advice.

Here is the **setting**:



&gt;We are in a modern day alternate reality, but instead of electricity, people use magic. This magic comes from people who have figured out how to bind Gods to the mortal plane. Most of these Gods have been captured, and people are using the God's magic as power. A huge war was fought over whether to use the power of the Gods or not. Most of the world was destroyed by the war and a giant city exists where people now live. The city has around 60 layers, where the rich and powerful live at the top and the poor live in the bottom layers. Outside the city is a wasteland, torn apart by the war; filled with unstable magic that is constantly raging. Rumors are that there is powerful treasure deep inside the wasteland.



Some information about my character's **background**
&gt;I am a lawful evil human sorcerer. When I was growing up I lived in a large house with my wealthy family. I got bored of this spoiled lifestyle and began to look into necromancy because it was edgy and looked down upon. As I continued to dabble in necromancy, my curiosity began to grow and I became fascinated with life/death magic because the concept is the most powerful. I learned about an evil God that had the power to control the dead and I began to try to please him. Through my years of service to this God I have gained his favor and to prove my devotion, I murdered a beggar and drank his blood. The God was impressed and gave me some powers over the dead. I began to draw followers and a sort of cult emerged as I led more followers to the God. After some prayer, the God told me to gather some powerful adventurers with various skills and abilities to go on a quest to find a staff that would give the God more power so he could attempt to rule. I plan on having profession (cult leader) as my revenue, gaining the support of followers as the campaign progresses, but building enemies in the process. These enemies feel threatened by the fact that I want my God to gain more power and not be controlled by people.



Introductions aside, we are **starting at level 4**. I like the necromancer theme but I'm not completely in love with only casting minions and sitting back; I love save/suck spells but eventually I do want to have some minions and more damaging spells. 

We rolled for **stats** and I got great rolls: 16, 14, 16, 16, 14, 16. I put the 14's into STR and WIS since I'm looking at a wildblooded Sanguine Sorcerer. I put the +2 human racial traits in CHA and CON, giving me 18 in both, and a 16 in DEX and INT

I took Human as a race to get extra feats and skills per level. I took the following **skills** (CS denoting a class skill):

* CS Bluff: 1
* Diplomacy: 4
* CS Intimidate: 4
* CS Knowledge (Arcana): 1
* CS Knowledge (Religion): 4
* Perception: 1
* CS Profession (Cult leader): 4
* Sense Motive: 3
* Survival: 1
* Use magical device: 1



I took the Sanguine bloodline because I like the free spells, the sanguine arcana is helpful, and the powers are alright. The feats help with survival but aren't too great. 

   
   
   
   
For **spells** I took the following:

    Level 0: Resistance, Daze, Prestidigitation, Touch of Fatigue, Ghost Sound, Detect Magic.
    
    Level 1: Mage Armor, Ray of Sickening, Grease, Cause Fear
    
    Level 2: Glitterdust (DM allowed me to use Reflex save instead of Will because Will makes literally 0 sense)


For my 3 **feats** I took:

* Improved initiative
 
* Spell Focus(Necromancy)
 
* Empowered Spell [Doesn't help me much right now, but hopefully it will be worthwhile when I get fireball. Although I should probably get a feat to help me out right now, I couldn't find one that I really loved. Also I have the Magical Lineage trait which will help]


I have 8000 gold to spend, but since magic is so common in this campaign, the DM rules that enchanted or magic items are half price. We're limited in how much items can cost; the most expensive item can't cost more than 50% of the wealth (4000g) and all other items can't exceed 25% (2000g).

The **items** I bought are:

* Handy Haversack
 
* Haramaki for the 1 AC with 0 penalties
 
* Extend Rod Lesser (metamagic)
 
* Cloak of Resistance +2
 
* Eyes of the Eagle
 
* Headband of Alluring Charisma +2

* Everburning Torch
 
* Adventure gear: Chalk, Sorcerer's kit, Spider silk rope, Dagger, Flask, Gear maintenance kit.





I would love any and all feedback, from little suggestions about feats to feedback that my whole things sucks and I should redo it all with [x]. The campaign starts within a few days so the earlier I can get suggestions, the better.

Again, thanks for reading, you're truly a good aligned redditor.

But to be honest,we rarely spend money (we're all new so we decided to not worry about hunger...and mostly cuz I really don't know how to have it affect them..) Because no one buys anything,really. They're content with the items they have and whatnot. I don't really know what they can and cannot buy at a merchant place, so I usually tell the, they can buy whatever is in the adventurer's vault, but that usually takes them foreeeever, and typically is better if I ask them to do it during the week so they can look through stuff. Either way, it rarely happens, so I sometimes give magic items through story and random finds, but usually, whenever they kill someone, its usually just some exp and sometimes some gold I usually don't know how to manage. 

I really, really need help figuring this out, Cuz I have the story telling element squared away; I just really need this aspect down packed. Any advice?"	t5_2qwdo	True

ArchAng3L_7	1	2	0	So I was talking to one of the groups I DM for and we began talking about the idea of recording our games and posting them on YouTube or even just as podcasts. I figured this would be a good place to see if there is a desire for something like this?

I'm DMing a campaign that's had success in maintaining for a year. Over that time, which originally started with 5 PC's, we gave one the boot due to personal reasons. We were planning on another one as well, lowering our table to 3 PC's, so I invited my sister, her boyfriend, and their roommate to play with us once a week. Naturally, my sister and her boyfriend loved it, the roommate could not meet up because our playing day is Saturday and he rarely makes it in. We wound up talking to the guy who was going to get the boot, and we decided to keep him in. So, now, without thinking, I have 7 PC's and I get a bit overwhelmed by running with 5. I figured 6 would be okay, but I really don't know how the hell to possibly run 7. I'm relatively new, and I put a lot of attention, but I don't really know how to organize this. Running multiple sessions or different campaigns is not an option. I'm the only one equipped to DM at this point and time, and I work 6 days a week. (Car salesman, yay...)

Any pointers for a large table? Because I'm starting to stress myself out =/

I am using the Hero Builder's Guidebook and rolled as randomly as possible, with a couple high 90's, and two 100's! Took a couple things out because they just didn't seem to work in my overall arc of the story, but I've hashed out what I can and now I seek your opinions/ideas. 

Subjects marked with an * are ones in which I seek.....guidance. Enjoy!



Home---

Temperate Climate:cold winters, warm summers

Hills:highlands,cliff dwellings, and any other rugged terrain.

*Encampment: These elven camps are at least semi nomadic and support between 10 and 50 elves.




Family---

Moderate: Your family owns at least a small dwelling or can make rent payments without significant concern. The family‚Äôs income slightly exceeds   its needs. 

Skilled trade or merchant family. You could be the child of someone as simple as the village cobbler, or as complex as the weaponsmith for Dwarfking Arenduil. 

Rudimentary: Most family members are versed in basics of using clubs, spears and knives in self defense and the defense of family and home. 
My dad can wield a solid bow and can take down your average flock-threatening animals. My mom knows how to make a good sword but can't swing it to save her life. I guess.

Good: Your family is known for involvement in the community and acting to help others. 
My dad is involved with whatever animal the tribe ""herd"" consists of and is a general good-doer, watching after them and giving out young creatures and defending neighbors' animals as well. Or something. Also my mom is kind, but quiet, and focused on her bladework, which has renown in the village.

*Normal: Your family‚Äôs ethical reputation matches their private ethics.

*Participatory: your family is a part of a religious order.

*Unknown: your family has no perceived character. Individuals are treated without    regard to the family name.

*Mixed: One part of your family support the current system and or rulers, and other faction is actively working to replace or remove that system or rulers.

Patriarchy: The male members control your family.




Ancestors---

*Immigrant- An ancestor was a settler from a far off land of which little is known.

    (M, Clufire Gimmergaunt

Master Artisan(x2): Two ancestors were artisans of unmatched skill who left a legacy of excellence that is still used as a standard gauge of quality.

(F, Caratris Gladomain, Swordsmith)

(F, Cardove Gladomain, Jeweler)


Education---

*Early-Book Learning: you learned how to read and write.

*Formal-History: You learned basic local or national history.

*Trade-Healing: You‚Äôve learned the skills of a healer or herbalist.






Life Events----------

*Early: became a refugee- War or some other disaster ruined your community.

*Youth: Great romance- Lingering effects may include a jilted lover or a current relationship- and a reputation for boorishness or tenderness.

*Pivotal:Religious Awakening- A new faith is created, a schism tears an existing faith apart, or a prophecy is announced, for example.




Relationships-----

Two living parents: Both are alive and healthy.

(Frutumal, father, ranger, shepherd)

(Janerris, mother, skilled swordmaker(kind of a weirdo))

Siblings: Twin- you have a fraternal twin, identical twin, or two triplet siblings

(Quolamin, wizard,bro (weirdooooo)
Thinking this guy is a serious wacko. Scenarios:
Thinks the room in the womb was meant for just my sister and him, thinks I'm a runt?

(Quierris, ranger, sister, like our father, we are close)
Sister takes after my father and becomes either a hunter or shepherd or something like him, we are kind and close to eachother but do not share similar goals, I guess?

*Grandparents: Unknown- they died before you were old enough to remember them.

Extended family: 8 including uncles, aunts, cousins, nephews, in laws, or ex-in-laws

    Paternal Aunt and Uncle are nermallll

        2 normal cousins

    Maternal Aunt, Wizard- Married and divorced(maybe killed husbands?)twice?
Thinking that this aunt could be the superstitious wizard that turns my brother to the nutty dark side

    Brother In Law


Friends---

None


Enemies----

*Enemy of the family: Your family has earned the enmity of a person, group, or opposing family.

Romantic Rival: You edged someone out in some affair of the heart, and they hold a grudge
Edged out my brother, perhaps? Furthering his madness and mistrust of his brother?

*Jilted Lover‚Äôs friend or Relative: someone harbors ill feelings for you due to your actions toward a loved one.


Instructor-
Basic: A particularly good instructor taught you the basic skills(hes dead, dave! EVERYONE IS DEAD, DAVE!)
Maybe a Count of Monte Cristo kind of thing where my brother had me thrown in jail and the prisoner next to me was this insane sort of sneaky secret agent for the Elf King? Do Elves have kings? I dunno.

I am very new to D &amp; D.  My friends have always used online gaming to stay in touch after we moved to different places, and we recently started playing D &amp; D using roll20.  I agreed to be DM and have read through the dungeon masters guide and rules compendium, etc., and we have gone through a few of the published campaigns, but now I want to create my own story.  

Long story short, I am having difficulty figuring out how I want to start it (and am also looking for any other tips as a relative newbie).  I want to keep the experience as open as possible and driven by the players, so I don't necessarily want to force them into the first encounter, but I don't really know of any other way of going about it (if I don't force them into something then I don't have anything prepared for the first round).  

I can try getting some discussion going but they have decided that they don't want their characters to know each other beforehand, and I think they are leaving it to me to come up with something interesting that would introduce all of their characters to each other and get the narrative flowing.

I have a general conception of a story/events/key encounters (to sum it up as this has probably already gotten too long it revolves around a baron who is collecting artifacts for seemingly noble causes but in reality is trying to open a portal to the far realm) but again I'm not sure how to kick it all off.

We are playing again, only this time with new characters that I'm making for them but with the books ""Heroes of Fallen Lands"" and ""Heroes of Forgotten Kingdoms"". They have more races and classes, and they tell you which skill you can add +2 to and stuff like that, not the actual character creating. So I need to create characters without the Redbox since, the classes and races are not there and it would simply take too long. We're meeting this Saturday and with midterms coming I have a LOT of homework, so the long redbox adventure doesn't really fit well with me. So I'm asking, how do i make the charcaters?

tl;dr: How do I make characters without the redbox.

OK, Nerm Ulfgar at the young age of 45 went out into the human world and for the next 15 year was a body guard to a Knights (maybe some other high end persons) Young daughter. Once she was grown and he had taught her how to defend herself he went back to his home a wealthy bachelor, but soon after his arrival a string off robberies took place. Naturally after his long absence he was the one to blame. Having dishonored his clan he set out to find these thieves and regain his trust.
This is my first game, hell i barely understand how to make a char. So that's the best I think I can do. Feel free to give me a hand.I am a Dwarf Fighter named Nerm.  "	t5_2qwdo	True

1334759541.0	sg1e0	Fun with a Psionic character... My personal experience in 4.0	ValcainHD	2	2	0	"I should go ahead and state now that in our game, not everything was completely adherent to the rules of D&amp;D. Our DM was a pretty relaxed guy about things (other than me, it was everyone's first time playing the game and we had a lot of inside jokes that we'd add into our game) and when building a character, I found psionics really interesting. My main interest was in teleportation and telekenisis, moving objects with the mind.

It's been about a year since I've played and I miss the game, so please forgive me that I don't remember a whole lot. I rolled an Eladrin (for the Fey Step, I believe? And the long sword proficiency). I believe I did a hybrid class, with a multiclass feat and eventually ended up with having a telekinetic power that would let me carry so much weight at once, and a Mage's Hand (or something similar). Each thing would allow me to carry 'x' amount of lbs to a distance of 30 feet or so.

I asked my buddy, because normally I believe this use of those two powers would end up causing the character to get distracted and the spell would end (or whatever), but I asked if I could use them with a sword and be a ranged/melee fighter, and I could move the swords 5 spaces a turn and they could be up to 5 or 6 spaces away from me (whatever the normal spell limit was). 

My buddy said sure. And, honestly it was a little broken in terms of power, but we were overpowered anyway. It was my friends first game DM-ing and we just had fun, messed around and were given fairly good equipment for our levels. However, he would also send very tough enemies at us and we'd all often come very close to dying. We were powerful for our levels, but we still made the game challenging by facing difficult enemies.

I forget what level we were, but our toughest fight came against a Weretiger (I believe?) He had a ton of HP and hit hard and hit often. My friend really didn't expect us to be able to defeat him, and was going to use him as a reoccurring enemy.

The fighting was.. very sad. Our ""tank"" could barely take a few hits before falling, but! At the very end of the fight, we got the Weretiger down to very low health, to the surprise of our DM, and I was the last one left. I was able to avoid getting hit too much thanks to feystep and, I believe I had another 5 space teleport power, as well. And just as it was going to be my turn to be wiped out, I got two crits (I believe, a 19 and then a 20? I'm not sure, maybe both weren't crits) in and dropped the Weretiger to just below 0 health! It was a very close call. Unfortunately, the weretiger didn't actually die, but he ran away (so he could return later, or something like that). 

Anyway,sorry for the extremely long post, but I just wanted to share it! Haha"	t5_2qwdo	True
1334109101.0	s3lyr	What's your style of DMing? And, what kind of DM do you like	mountainking	1	1	11	"Personally, I don't like to use the books all that much except for xp, and monster ideas. I like making up stats for the monsters so they can always challenge my players,but also manageable. For example, Liches are listed at such a level that my level 5-ish party can't even imagine handling it. So I dumb the creature down and what not. I also enjoy making up spells and attacks my  ~~sheep~~ players can have. I'm a very spontaneous DM that is *cross my fingers* unpredictable. I also HATE fudging the dice.

1332130253.0	r300f	Need help building an Adventure	TheMarquisDeSpace	2	2	0	"I have DMed a couple times before but I've always used pre-made adventures like Expedition to Castle Ravenloft. So I decided this time I would create an adventure myself. But I'm stuck on finding ideas that fit.

My basic idea so far is for the players to have their souls removed from their bodies by a cult. The cult takes their bodies and places souls from the land of the dead inside. Meanwhile the players must go on the Journey Of The Soul, which is based on Aztec Afterlife beliefs.

In the Aztec beliefs the soul must travel the 9 levels of the underworld before their souls find rest. It's a journey that takes 4 years. In my campaign I'm taking the 9 trials the soul must face for each land and am assigning an event to it.

The trials are
1. Cross a deep River

2. Pass between two mountains that have fused together

3. Climb an obsidian Mountain

4. Pass through an icy wind that cuts like a knife

5. Pass through a place where flags wave

6. Be pierced by arrows

7. Pass among wild beasts that eat human hearts

8. Pass over a narrow stone path

9. Reach the place where your soul finds rest

And these are the corresponding ideas

1. PCs arrive in the land of the dead. The city they are in is under an embargo but they can get passage with local drug boats. The only way they can get aboard is by taking out one of the gangs in the city
2. (Pass between two mountains that have fused together)
3. PCs find a man being attacked in the woods by wolves, they help him and he invites them to dinner at his home which is an obsidian castle on a large mountain. When inside he reveals that he is a vampire who forces people to fight for his pleasure, he then drops the PCs to the hollowed out mountain base and they have to fight their way back to the top
4. The PCs are walking when a blizzard breaks out. They find there way to a cathedral built of ice. Here they find messages of a creature they thought was sent from the gods but turned out to bring destruction. It was sealed in the depths of the cathedral
5. (Pass through a place where flags wave)
6. (Be pierced by arrows)
7. PCs enter a small village surrounded by a forest. They are warned that no one survives the forest. Only one person has come back alive recently. He will begrudgingly take the PCs through but during the trip he will change into a monster and run towards the village where everyone is changing into the monsters. Only one man was known to have slayed the beasts and a statue of him is in the village center but it is actually the man who has been flesh to stoned
8. The PCs enter a stone temple and are told that it will be the last part of their journey. It will be the longest part(4 years) and they must go alone. They are sent down a misty stone path. Each year they encounter a single person from their life who will disown the player and fight them. Most likely ending with PCs fighting evil versions of themselves
9. The PCs make it to the inner sanctum of the god of death. Where they must confront him about their bodies and convince him to switch them back(Not quite sure how yet)

Any help for parts 2,5,and 6?

tl:dr Need ideas for parts 2,5,and 6 based on the Aztec afterlife"	t5_2qwdo	True
1332125357.0	r2wa0	Advice getting started with a younger player.	artard	1	1	0	"I've never played D&amp;D before, and today I got the 4th ed (I think) red box starter kit for my 9 year old and I to try out.  We did some intro stuff, and had a blast.

I'm wondering about two things - number of players, and editions.

1. Number of players - is it advisable to have one of us control 2-3 heroes, and another be the DM? I'm not sure how well 2-player D&amp;D pans out as we potentially start delving into the core books.

2. Editions - I've read that the 4th ed is easy but combat heavy. I have a feeling that what we played today is probably about the right level of complication for us, for now.  Since I've heard so many people complain about the 4th ed, and say that 3.5 is the bee's knees - any thoughts on tradeoffs between complexity and 3.5 potentially being much better?

I know you guys seem to get a lot of 'hi im a new player...' around here but any advice is appreciated. I skimmed this subreddit and tried to read up on them but felt I'm looking for more advice regarding playing with a younger player, and potentially not reaching out yet to get internet strangers to come play at our house (no offense, ;)

1374182430.0	1il5lp	I'm making a custom steampunk expansion in 4th edition and I would appreciate a little advice.	Tfeth282	1	2	1	"I decided a while back that D&amp;D and Steampunk needed to mix and I've finally gotten around to making it. I've got four classes (Infantry, Artillery, Engineer, and Medic), two new species (Automaton and Splicer), a few new mechanics (Guns and explosives, mechs and powered armor, modern medicine, and a couple of various other toys), and some of the basic writing behind it all.

The way I'm going about this seems like its working. I decided what things I wanted to include, and then make them as similar to another thing in the game as I can while still making sense. For example, guns function rather similarly to crossbows, mechs work a lot like mounts, and Modern Medicine really only has a chance of addictiveness over ""Advanced Potion of Healing"".

That being said, I'm not quite sure that I know what I'm doing. I could use some advice. Any old advice will do. Right now I'm working on ideas for feats and powers. I'm especially confused about why the fighter class has so many ways of saying ""Martial attack, strength+weapon vs. AC"". Are all my new classes expected to do the same thing? I also need a lesson in how ""Massive Damage"" works. I have a more experienced friend who keeps telling me I'm going to need the mechanic  for my inclusion of Gatling guns and similar weapons, but all massive damage means to me is what happens when you attack a [giant enemy crab](http://xkcd.com/286/) in it's weak point. Some things might also need a little more than common sense to operate off of. For example, some things can't function without a fuel source, used up at a steady rate over time. However, I have no way besides common sense to tell how much time has passed.

If no one cares, I won't bother posing anything about the specifics until I'm done, but if interest is shown I could give you all a bit more to look over. So tell me what you think, point out obvious things I missed, and ask any questions necessary. But most importantly, tell me if I'm doing anything wrong."	t5_2qwdo	True

Slyther‚Ä∫ He has a family, with a mother, a father, and young kid brother and sister. Livis in a nice home. Dad works for the government as a hgihly paid ""construction worker."" 
08/05/2013 22:01:22 ‚ÄπFriend‚Ä∫ why's he leave 
08/05/2013 22:01:23 ‚ÄπFriend‚Ä∫ ? 
08/05/2013 22:01:24 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ Dad dies in a work-related accident, government proclaims. 
08/05/2013 22:02:22 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ My char finds this suspicious goes and finds government conspiracy and secrets. Governemnt turns whole town against existing family and exiles them all to a forest area. 
08/05/2013 22:03:09 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ My char tries to feed and support family, but one by one they all die. Mom dies first out of anguish, despair, and old age. Then younger siblings die. My char survies 
08/05/2013 22:04:08 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ His sole purpose in life is to exploit government conspiracies to subjects, and demolish the government and all the citizens of city which exiled his family 
08/05/2013 22:04:58 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ Using deception, mind control, trickery, illusion (powers embody the elements government uses to control and subject suggestive citizens) 
08/05/2013 22:05:22 ‚ÄπFriend‚Ä∫ got a city in mind? 
08/05/2013 22:05:31 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ Nope, no idea. 
08/05/2013 22:07:05 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ Other tidbits of info: my char's only real concern is exploiting and killing the government and governed citizens of the city, and entire city itself. 
08/05/2013 22:08:05 ‚ÄπFriend‚Ä∫ okay. for pfs you'll have to be from a far off city, visiting Absalom and joining the Pathfinders to accumulate power. 
08/05/2013 22:08:08 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ He has a soft spot for the elderly and young children (mother and siblings) 
08/05/2013 22:08:12 ‚ÄπFriend‚Ä∫ In any other campaign, give her. 
08/05/2013 22:08:18 ‚ÄπFriend‚Ä∫ Fighter? 
08/05/2013 22:08:25 ‚ÄπFriend‚Ä∫ Sounds like a fighter. 
08/05/2013 22:08:53 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ I really, really want either magic user or psionic based character. 
08/05/2013 22:09:02 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ I don't enjoy the thought of playing a fighter. 
08/05/2013 22:09:15 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ For instance, here are the areas of magic I want to focus on: 
08/05/2013 22:09:29 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ Mind Control (Everything Involved) 
08/05/2013 22:09:39 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ Illusions (trickery/deception) 
08/05/2013 22:09:49 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ Manipulation (people/objects‚Äîappear, cast out, create, break/animals/creatures) 
08/05/2013 22:10:00 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ Morphing (myself/others/objects/animals/familiars)

08/05/2013 22:10:26 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ and lastly Invisibility (myself/others/objects) 
08/05/2013 22:10:27 ‚ÄπFriend‚Ä∫ Kewl. Psionics is third party stuff in PFS 
08/05/2013 22:10:42 ‚ÄπFriend‚Ä∫ You want a wizard

08/05/2013 22:10:54 ‚ÄπFriend‚Ä∫ maybe an arcane trickster 
08/05/2013 22:10:58 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ wizard, not sorcerer? 
08/05/2013 22:11:00 ‚ÄπFriend‚Ä∫ Pathfinder society 
08/05/2013 22:11:08 ‚ÄπFriend‚Ä∫ it's Paizo's organized play 
08/05/2013 22:11:11 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ ohhh gotcha! 
08/05/2013 22:11:26 ‚ÄπFriend‚Ä∫ frankly, and this is just me, I wouldn't waste time on concept to play with them 
08/05/2013 22:11:36 ‚ÄπFriend‚Ä∫ It's a bit of a slugfest 
08/05/2013 22:11:52 ‚ÄπFriend‚Ä∫ but a good place to meet players and get into/recruit for home games 
08/05/2013 22:11:55 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ huh. ok! 
08/05/2013 22:12:27 ‚ÄπFriend‚Ä∫ yeah, that way the peeps you play with are peeps you've seen in action, not random internetters 
08/05/2013 22:12:51 ‚ÄπFriend‚Ä∫ Though random internetting is how I found my current awesome group, so I shouldn't knock it too hard. 
08/05/2013 22:13:07 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ Haha! Scenario: Innkeeper starts charging ridiculous fee to stay in the inn.I notice. 
08/05/2013 22:13:20 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ Innkeeper has a wife. 
08/05/2013 22:14:07 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ I put thoughts in wife's head repeatedly over a period of time that her husband is cheating on her with a harlet. Each vision/sound more intense than the last 
08/05/2013 22:14:15 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ Finally, drives her mad. 
08/05/2013 22:14:55 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ Create illusion that husband is sleeping with another woman, passionately. Wife has built up intesne rage, kills husband. No more high prices!  
08/05/2013 22:15:39 ‚ÄπSlyther‚Ä∫ That's what I mean by indirectly causing harm. I had no way of knowing how wife would react, all I did was plant the seed inside her head.
Friend‚Ä∫ Human/halfling/halfelf 
08/05/2013 22:18:21 ‚ÄπFriend‚Ä∫ Wizard/witch Rogue or ninja 
08/05/2013 22:18:32 ‚ÄπFriend‚Ä∫ you want arcane trickster eventually I think

What qualifies as a major and minor action, how many of these are allowed? In addition, what are action points? I see them referenced in the player's handbook with no real explanation, and a box for them on the character sheets. But I can't find any explanation of them in my books or google.	t5_2qwdo	True
1360185078.0	180sbo	New DM here! Question about how do Familiars work??? 	Froomies	1	2	3	Hey I am a new DM and currently going strong in 4E. Our ranger in the group asked about Familiars and I sadly have nothing nor can find anything on them. I suggested he become a Beastmaster Ranger but he declined and wanted to stick to his long range bow attacks. But still if anyone has a link or information on how Familiars work I would be most Greatfull	t5_2qwdo	True

I've been working on making a playable bear class. Only have 10 levels planned out. Was wondering what your thought are on it. Should it be nerfed, fixed, changed in anyway post it here. I made this class for 4e.

Much to my consternation (afterwards at least) I continually go overboard with my chaotic evilness, such as killing a pawnshop owner and customer, drowning 3 people with a car, and killing 25 people with C4, in addition to having a hit list. (Note: A few of the people were necessary). Anyone think that  I have a bit of a phyco streak, or I just really get into my character (he started chaotic neutral, but is now a safe chaotic evil)	t5_2qwdo	True
