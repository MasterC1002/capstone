I'm just writing this to express how awesome Drupal is!

I'm in the process of developing my second (practice) website. After using Joomla on my first one and achieving very, very poor results I was a little disappointed with the whole CMS idea. I had been told that CMS' were supposed to make life simple, yet when I tried to do simple things like adding new content blocks or empty pages I ended up wasting hours before posting on the Joomla forum just to receive the unforgiving verdict of the J-community: sorry, you just can't do that!

Not surprisingly when I read that Drupal was supposedly less intuitive and more complicated than Joomla I was reluctant to try it. But I did anyway, and discovered those reviews couldn't have been more wrong. Drupal gives you near total-control over the structure of your site. Plus whenever I want to do something I always find what I need where I expect it to be. For example today I wanted to redirect the user after logging in. I didn't know if such a function was available. So I tried to click on ""configuration"" then clicked on ""actions"" and there it was, simple as pie!
And how about the fact that Drupal was supposed to be counter intuitive? After playing around with it for a couple of days I started watching the tutorials at nodeone.se and guess what, I still haven't heard a single thing that I hadn't already figured out myself by just toying around with Drupal! Surely that never happened with Joomla - matter of fact I'm still unclear how menus and modules work!

So there you go, I am now a believer in the power of Drupal!"	t5_2qhl5	True

Now that Drupal 7 is starting to mature a bit, it's getting my attention and I'd like to get more serious about building sites in Drupal.

**I'm trying to get an idea of the ideal dev setup and process for Drupal.** What works best for you?

Please describe your development environment and what process you use to go from dev -&gt; staging -&gt; production. If you have any particular tools you use, mention those: virtualbox/vmware/bitnami stack, vim/emacs/an IDE, bash deployment scripts, svn/git/mercurial/bazaar, nginx/apache/lighttpd, drush, a starter drupal distro, starter themes, etc.

Be as detailed as you are willing. I'd like to hear about all of it. What do you use to go from step 1 to a published Drupal site? I'm particularly interested in people who work in a team environment, but individual dev environments would be useful too.

Thanks.

**Edit:** I didn't mean to imply that I'm a complete beginner to Drupal. I've built a few Drupal sites, used some base themes like Zen and worked with Drush. I'm more interested in the details of your own development/deployment structure.

I'll have training opportunities to get up to speed but I wanted to know from you, experienced with Drupal: What should I know? What should I be careful with? What's the one thing to remember? etc.

Edit: bonus question. One of the project I'd like to accomplish is creating a mobile version of one of their site, without creating a separate site.

I've been thinking about using a Reddit 'style' discussion area instead of a more traditional forum, as i think it might just work better (and the built in Drupal forum has its own set of problems).

So it looks like, people are already looking at voting api with an eye to re-creating Reddit on Drupal : http://drupal.org/node/683090

There is also a full reddit theme : http://drupal.org/project/themereddit

and even someone said they built a full install profile clone of digg/reddit ""Drupaligg"" : http://programmingbulls.com/drupaligg-open-source-diggreddit-clone-using-php-b
but the code seems to be abandoned and the sample sites offline.

Wondering if anyone else know of any good blog posts, or ideally features, that create a copy of Reddit functionality, hopefully including the excellent /r/ group functionality?

Please tell me I'm doing this wrong.	noobgoldberg	24	3	35	"I'm a front-end dev with lots of experience building sites, but hardly any experience building a site in Drupal from the ground up.  I'd like to hear how more experienced devs build the front-end of Drupal sites.

I work at a small company with designers and a couple of experienced web devs with Drupal experience.  We're using D7.

Basically, we use Omega as a base theme and then have our own sub theme.  The dev sets up the menus and basic functionality of the site. I then try to theme the site with the default markup that Drupal and Omega spit out.  I use Firebug to find my selectors and go from there.  It's a nightmare.  Trying to jam a design (that was designed with zero consideration of Drupal) into the pre-existing markup can be challenging and time consuming to say the least.  I have to override tons of default css properties that are Drupal or Omega generated.  There are some instances where I'll go into a tpl and edit the markup.  This usually happens at the node level or sometimes the region.  That makes things a lot easier.  But for the main structure of the site editing the markup is not possible, so I end up using absolute positioning or weird css tricks I wouldn't normally use.  The CSS files start getting ridiculous after a while.  I could go on...

Are we doing this completely backwards?  I'm getting the feeling that the way we're doing this makes it easier on the dev side, but a nightmare on the front-end.

How do you guys approach it?

I've been using Drupal as a CMS for some time now and have a very good understanding of it *as a user* but only basic development skills. I know the architecture but only developed some small ""toy"" modules.

My goal would be to get gigs on sites like odesk/freelancer.com etc... with the hope of landing some long-term projects through it. If you are from the first world the pay on these sites must not be very tempting but as someone who lives in South America I don't need 80K a year to live nicely. On the other hand, I don't want to work for $8/hour, that's why I want to learn the platform inside/out, so that I can bid on more complicated projects than PSD to drupal theme.

The main reasons I'm considering this are:

1) Drupal is pretty popular
2) Drupal is pretty complicated which means there is less competition and you can charge a premium if you are an expert in it (again, premium is  relative)
3) I already know enough about Drupal to not have to start from scratch

I'm interested in hearing from drupal freelancers and people with more experience than me. Does this plan seem viable or are my assessments wrong?
 
A specific question for those with odesk experience, are you generally expected to be a competent designer as well? I can probably do PSD2theme but not much more.

I've  been asked to set up a webshop. I've done shops before with Joomla!/VirtueMart (also image preparation/data import etc.) but as I am currently exploring Drupal as my primary development system I would like to do it with drupal6/ubercart. Even though I am no Drupal wizard yet, I know the basics, i. e. CCK, Views, Panels, Imagecache/Lightbox etc. I am using Fusion for theming.

Also the shop would be very small (some sort of hand-crafted baby quilts), so importing data shouldn't be an issue. It should be bilingual though. Selling would work through PayPal.

Now my usual problem: how much should I charge for a Website with an empty Ubercart Shop but considering that I've got to do CI/graphics/proofreading/copy writing as well? Usually I get paid per hour (â¬50.- through â¬70.-) but as I've got to learn the system I'd rather charge a fixed price this time.

1355849913.0	1523tl	Finally finished my first 'large project' Drupal site!	GeekFish	18	2	11	"http://www.thenextbite.tv/

A little background on the project: The client had an old Drupal 6 site that was in dire need of an upgrade (looked like something straight out of the 90's). One of the hardest parts of the whole project was keep the 'new site' updated and current while minimizing downtime on the live site. 

I had to basically set up a 'middle man' site on my home PC, export the 6 database, import it on my home PC, update that install to 7, then use Node Export to grab all the forum topics that changed during my initial database export (only about 4 months worth of posts). Comments I could get all in one shot with the table, but had to watch because some of my NID's changed from the live site to the new site. I learned the Drupal database structure inside and out because of all this :) I should have built an exporter, but I found it quicker to do it by hand. 

Another thing I love about this site is the video section. I set up Feeds to import their YouTube uploads, then use GoogTube to create the embed code in all the nodes. The client now only has to upload to YouTube and their site 'mirrors' the content. Before, they had to make thumbnails and copy/paste embed code into CCK fields. The videos also play inside a neat little fish finder :) If you click on the titles on the homepage or the video section. The video thumbs load the actual node though. 

Still have to make some Views a little nicer (the article page is kind of dull, working on importing all the thumbnails back into the posts), need optimize the video player too (that container is a big image and doesn't need to be that size, loads pretty slow)... The Hot Topic page needs a little love also, that was an afterthought that wasn't discussed in the original project, but I threw in last minute (the old Hot Topics was just that list from the site, didn't have any sponsor feeds, I want to make the feeds more like the homepage, import images, slideshows... stuff like that...). 

I'm a noob, but let me know if you have any questions or please give me some feedback on how I can improve the site.

I took a look at Aegir a while ago and though I liked working with it, I didn't like the lack of version control integration. I had casually read [Mig5's workflow](http://mig5.net/content/drupal-deployments-workflows-version-control-drushmake-and-aegir) but I wasn't initally convinced.

Today I was determined to figure it out and see if it could improve on the workflow I had been used to with Webistrano. Well, I think I've cracked it and I think it could well be the way forward for me. I still don't think it's perfect (and Mig5 I'm sure wouldn't say it's perfect either), however it does work.

1301158781.0	gc0gl	Is there a screencast of an experienced Drupal developer building a site (of moderate complexity,) from start to finish?		18	1	6	"I've been trying to get into the Drupal game for quite some time now, i remember downloading and installing Drupal 5, getting frustrated and giving up, the same goes for Drupal 6. I read the Drupal.org case-studies and visit sites made with Drupal and can't imagine doing it Drupal. Drupal, as I see it, is extremely modular, so when you watch a screencast about image galleries, it's hard to do anything beyond what the screencast covers.

Are there any screencasts of an experienced Drupal developer downloading and installing drupal, downloading contrib modules (and themeing on top of a Zen sub-theme,) and essentially building a site of moderate complexity from start to finish?

1269118842.0	bfzx8	Tips for a experienced developer working on their first Drupal site?	virtron	17	0	31	"I've been working as a web developer for some time, and I have experience with a number of web frameworks (Struts, CakePHP, Django, to name a few) and now I have a client that has requested their site be built in Drupal 6. The whole architecture is so different from what I am used to that I'm finding it all a bit weird and even simple things seem to take a long time to accomplish.

Almost all of the documentation that I have found is either aimed at people who want to do all of their site building in the admin interface or people who are building everything from the ground up using custom modules.

In general I would like to use CCK custom content types, but write custom modules that handle aggregating and displaying them. Most of the pages need to display a lot of related content and the design is not very ""Drupalesque"" so flexibility is key.

I'd really appreciate some pointers to docs or insight into how to create idiomatic Drupal from the perspective of someone that knows their way around code, but doesn't want to build everything from scratch. I can go into more specific questions if anyone is interested, but I don't want this to seem like a ""give me teh codez"" kind of post.

Thanks in advance.

[edit] - I just wanted to add a thank you to the top of the post for everyone that has taken the time to reply. There have been quite a few recommendations that I'll be following up on. Much appreciated."	t5_2qhl5	True

Calibas	17	1	14	"Okay, the site itself is fairly complicated, it's mainly a news site, but with many social networking features. Seems that in general, the more contributed/custom modules you use, the more complex the transfer is. If your site just uses core modules, I imagine an upgrade to D7 is fairly quick and easy, but this turned out to be the most difficult project I've ever taken on. 

Not only did I have to rebuild the site in D7, but it also took a substantial amount of PHP coding to get all the data to migrate. I ended up using a combination of the Migrate module, the Feeds module, and direct exporting/importing of MySQL tables to get everything transferred. The most difficult part was getting the more obscure field types to transfer over, which is why I ended up using the Feeds module. An add-on to Feeds had proper mapping for an embedded video field, which I was unable to find for the Migrate module. I had first attempted to create my own mapping for the field, but was never able to get it to work properly.

There's an enormous amount of resources to help with a D6 to D7 migration, but they're scattered over 20+ different sites. Chances are, everything you're doing with the transfer has been done by someone else before, you may just have to do a bit of searching to find an example. 

Here's a good introduction to the process, though it's only the very tip of the iceberg:

http://dtek.net/blog/drupal-6-to-drupal-7-via-migrate-2

2.Convenience: I almost always use my mobile phone to access this subreddit and the reddit app makes it much faster than logging into Drupal and navigating to a specific thread of interest. 

3.Real answers: to me, it seems like if you post a question on Drupal forums you're more likely to get short quick responses and a link to some documentation where you have to hunt and sift through  to 20 pages worth of documentation to find the answer relevant to your situation. 

Does anyone else feel this way? If you have a pressing question or need tips do you go here or to Drupal.org direct? Maybe it's just the mountain of info  the drupal forums that give me tired-head, I guess that's a good thing but it seems overwhelming for the most part. "	t5_2qhl5	True

* couple of tousands nodes 

* multilingual(4 languages)

* deep apachesolr integration 

* 15 content types, 5 taxonomies and 100 fields

* 120 others modules (panels, features, strongarm, openlayers, rules, services, scheduler ect)

* a few (I know of) core hacks and module hacks

My clients really want a fixed time estimat (often given within an hours). My main issues with the site is:

* There are a vast amount of security updates and bug fixes available. How do you estimate an update (with core &amp; module hacks)? (And explain the importance to the client?).

* Multilingual and 120+ modules makes a site significant more complex and adds to development time. How do explain that to a client?

* When taking over a site, how long do you use to get familiar with the site? (Only a few developer notes available).

So what I am really asking is how do you guys approach this? Clients wants cheap and fast development all the while the their site is more complex. I just want to get paid the hours I put in.

After getting a few ""Required: Your DreamHost VPS needs help!"" emails, I decided to look more closely into a clients issues.  I ignored the first couple because the site shouldn't be having any problems.  About a year ago for this VPS, I set up a memory manager (7is7), tweaked xcache to 64MB of memory, and set up Boost.  The site was handling somewhere around 1.5M pageviews a day (which really isn't much), and now its handling 5% of that so I was surprised to see that this was actually an issue.

I first noticed the memory manager was disabled.  I renabled that without much thought - Dreamhost does a good job of eating cron jobs randomly.  I'm still not certain if this was disabled intentionally.  Then I noticed that Boost was disabled.  Clients typically hate static page caching because they don't understand it, so that this would be done intentionally was annoying but not surprising.  I left this turned off.

It was at this point that my boss told me that ""they"" redid the site, so I don't think its much our responsibility anymore.  All of the sudden the changes all made sense.  Doing some further poking, I found that memcache was disabled, and the biggest surprise was finding out that xcache was back at its default setting of 2x8MB which is completely insufficient for a Drupal site.

This site now takes 9.5s for first page load according to webpagetest.org, and 3.5s for a repeat view.  Comparing this to a site that I'm running in a multisite on Linode taking 3.5s for a first view and .7 seconds for a repeat view and its pretty obvious that this clients site is incredibly slow.  In short, their server is now 4x times slower, costs 2x to 3x as much to host, and is completely incapable of handling much traffic.  Should this client get some press the server is going to melt.

They wanted files password protected but wouldn't tell me why, and got upset when I tried to carefully find out more. I eventually got them to tell me that they were just trying to track downloads, but they didn't like my suggestion of just using analytics for that.  Fast forward a few convoluted solutions (of course we couldn't just use user accounts with permissions) with multiple pages and various modules (or at one point simple .htaccess rules) and I now see that they are just available as plain files again.  Shocker.

They had *at least* 6 different salesforce forms all over the place, all with different information, and half of them were named the same thing.  They would regularly send emails asking to have something updated but be vague on which one needed to be updated (did I mention that I could never get this client to send a link to the page they wanted changed?)  Most of these are now gone.

They wanted maps that included pins of all the nodes (sometimes upwards of 10k) which regularly crashed any browser, and those are not even linked on the primary navigation where before they were an *intense* focus.  They didn't care that it took *minutes* for some of the maps to load, they just had to have them and they had to show old / irrelevant data because moar pins iz gud.

They wanted a ""fancy"" scrollbar on some pages, but not others.  No pattern here, just arbitrary to the point where we needed to tailor each page to the point of annoyance.  They would edit pages and depending on the page they might need a scrollbar added, or they might decide that they wanted to page not to be limited in height.  The scrollbar is now gone (which is what I'd have done a long time ago if permitted).

It just makes me rage that I struggled with so many of these bad ideas, only to see them rip them out at some random point later anyway.  In short, the site has been gutted of almost everything that I'd have never added to it in the first place.  As my boss said ""Maybe Christmas came early for us"", because they haven't asked us for anything in a while and I'm more than happy not to get requests from them."	t5_2qhl5	True

I first created the site using drupal4 and I've been upgrading ever since. The site is a few gigabytes in size, mostly astrophotography. The club has ~50 members.

Just yesterday, my hosting provider told me my site uses ""too many resources"" and that I needed to reduce how much CPU my site is consuming, spend more money or get out. 

My tables are optimized, my CSS and JS are optimized, caching is turned on. I've even patched include/common.inc to gzip the css and js files - but the provider has decided the site is using too much CPU.

Any suggestions at all would be appreciated. I'm open to the idea that my site is misconfigured, but I really can't see how. The devel module indicates that pages take ~300ms to execute and about 25-30 megs of RAM. Is this unusual? I have a second site that I use for testing, on a different box. It shows similar results.

**Edit** - I've rephrased things a bit to be more clear and to add details.

**Edit Again** - Thanks for all the feedback, particularly on typical drupal usage. I didn't want to reveal the site name or the provider name because I didn't want to turn this into a thing about bashing the provider (or hammering my site). Discussing with the provider, I've been on a $5/month plan for 6-8 years now and they think they would be happy if I moved to a $10 or $12 per month plan, which would fit into the club's budget I think. The site is http://www.chesmontastro.org, if you're interested.

1345751219.0	ypnuy	Best Way to Migrate a HUGE Drupal 6 site to Drupal 7?	GeekFish	15	3	45	"I have a pretty large Drupal 6 site that I need to migrate to 7 (also changing servers during the process). Here's some info on my set up:

- Don't have access to the current server, only access to admin functions in the current Drupal 6 site.

- I did manage to get the database out using 'Back Up and Migrate', I created a Drupal 6 site on my home server, imported the database using BigDump (the database is roughly 213MB) and had all the content (minus images and files, but I knew that would happen). 

- Attempted to upgrade that install to 7, but ran into multiple errors. First error was a php timeout, fixed it by setting it to unlimited in php.ini. The next error was generic 'Process stopped unexpectedly on # module' check watchdog for more info. Looked at watchdog, says the exact same thing (no help there). When I rerun update.php, it has 17 updates to do (forums, nodes and taxonomy are what's left), but immediately fails with the same error message. Site is non-functional now (on my home server). 

If I can't get the old site upgraded to 7, I at least want to be able to get the forums (the forums are pretty big) and users (sitting at ~13,000) over to the new site, I can rebuild everything else by copy/paste. 

So, here's what I'm asking with this huge wall of text:

1. Can I build a Drupal 7 site and update the 6 database by hand? I'm fairly confident in my PHP and MySQL abilities, so I wouldn't mind doing that.

2. If that's not an option, is there anyway to just get the Users and Forums out of an old site? Would getting the 6 site on my home server, deleting any unneeded content and trying the update again be the way to go? 

3. Similar to option 2, but could I do the elements 1 at a time? Ex. Get the 6 site running at home again, delete everything except users, upgrade home server to 7, transfer to 7 site on host. Install 6 again at home, get the 6 site working again, delete everything except forums, upgrade, transfer, etc....

Anybody have a good way to do this? They kind of outgrew their 6 install, so most of the stuff being transferred is probably going to be deleted anyway. Again, if I just get the forums and users, I won't really care if I can't get anything else, that's easily done by hand. 

**EDIT: FIXED! Set max php timeout to unlimited and my max memory to 256MB and that did the trick. I think the initial timeout corrupted the database, so I completely wiped everything clean, set the timeout and memory, THEN upgraded again without an issue. Thank you all for your comments! Now I'm going to try the site in both 7 and 6 and see which one would work best for the client.**"	t5_2qhl5	True

I'm working on a way to explain to our clients what the process is like for developing a Drupal site. It's hard to do without getting overly technical, or without sending them to a training. The phases we need to explain in detail are:

* Kickoff and Functional Needs Analysis
* Wireframes and Implementation Plan (iterations)
* Graphic Design Exploration and Design Analysis
* Prototype Development (including module customization, et cetera)
* Hosting Conversation (we don't do hosting)
* Initial Demo/Presentation (although with some clients this needs to be held off until after the theming is complete, since a site without a theme is quite unnerving)
* Tweaking
* Graphic Design Implementation
* Graphic Design Feedback
* User training
* Content Staging
* Soft Launch (optional)
* Go Live
* Additional feedback and tweaks
* Retainer (optional)

I thought about using the construction analogy, but apparently this presents a rigidity that isn't necessarily a part of the Drupal development process. Although an analogy would be helpful, I feel.

One of the companies I work for hired a 3rd party dev. team to handle the development of a drupal site I designed and themed. They asked me today to do some additional work...adding in graphics to the content types they've developed, bla bla bla. I couldn't help but a take a look under the hood, as I have been developing my own drupal sites(nothing commercial yet, just tests) and wanted to compare how a team of pros handles this project compared to what I would do.


I noticed that a lot of blocks they incorporated into the site just have static html pasted into them, and are then styled with css in the theme directory. All of the imagery is placed in an image folder in the theme itself.


Now, I'm by no means an expert, but isn't this wrong? For example, the team created a unordered list menu for external links in a block. Why wouldn't they have used the menu module, or a view? Or added this at the template level? The content itself may not need to change, but isn't this a development no-no?


The marketing division of this company is handling the project, and as I'm sure you all know all to well, marketing companies run off of buzz words and what's hot at the moment. As long as the site is ""in Drupal"" with ""Ajax"" and ""HTML 5""(shudder) and ""running on the cloud""(on a humorous side note, they say this all the time. trying to explain what cloud computing is to them is like explaining physics to a 3 year old) they will probably be happy with the finished product.

I'm a manager at an ad agency in a very suburban area (About an hour outside of Pittsburgh, PA).  We have been in business since the 80's, and in the past 2 or 3 years have geared most of our business toward web design and development.

Recently, we have been looking to bring on a web designer / developer combination and I have a few colleagues questioning the amount that I'm looking to pay for this position, and I just wanted the perspective of some others who work in the field.

Essentially, the candidate I'm looking at has about 3 years real-world experience, is still learning drupal but knows Adobe CS, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Wordpress, and has worked on a few drupal websites and knows the basics.  They have taken some college courses, but don't have a degree.

Their responsibilities are as follows...

* Design websites in starting in omnigraffle or any other UX program, ending with photoshop mockup
* Build websites in plain html / css from scratch
* Edit pre-build websites with html / css
* Adjust drupal css to code website (Some php)
* Data Entry (Transferring data between multiple very large websites)

Eventually we want the candidate to be able to...

* Build a complete wordpress page from scratch
* Work on the back end as well as front end of sites.

The official title of the job is web designer / developer. 

This is a 9-5 on-site office job.

2) should I make an installation profile and/or a drush make file?

3) I was thinking of using Capistrano or Jenkins for deployment, what do folks use to deploy your changes to staging/production?

4) My organization will have a good number (probably a couple hundred) sites that will have a lot of the same features, content types, themes, etc. The only difference will be changing the color scheme, banner logo, enabling/disabling some features, and perhaps changing the site layout (Panels and Page manager?).

I'm supposed to make a mobile app (PhoneGap with jQueryMobile on Android) with an existing Drupal site as backend. The site is a plant/flower collection for a local university colege. this uses a custom content-type ""plant"" (several text fields, pictures, taxonomies). The owner of the site wants a mobile app that can be used to take pictures out in the field, and add these along with geolocation from gps, datetime and some other data as a new content type called ""observation"". I need to somehow link it to plant so that one plant can have several observations.
On the app I should be able to browse/search plants, select plants and add observations to them (meaning to upload gps data etc. and most critically a picture taken with the phone). Furthermore I need to be able to recieve a list of observations including the geolocations, so I can put locations on google maps. Ideally, I should then be able to click on one observation which would take me from the map to the observation. 

This picture should give a general idea of what I'm thinking:

I've been developing Drupal sites for about 3 years now, but came from a primarily design and front-end background, so I have no insight or experience with actual site deployment and version control best practices. I've worked with proprietary CMSes that had this sort of black magic built in, so I'm familiar with the concept, but working with Drupal, my only source control is my memory and my deployment routine is SCP and crossing my fingers (then fixing permissions manually)

I've tried searching the webz for information on managing this phase of web development with Drupal, but mostly all I find is higher-level discussion about what tools they use, but never anything about how to use said tools. I've never worked with any version control software and I only started using the command line recently, so its still intimidating at times and very much seems like a dark art I've yet to truly unlock the secrets of.

So if anyone can offer any insight or links into how to make developing and deploying sites from my local XAMPP installation to a dev/staging environment online and finally the live site, and being able to make changes to said environments after launch not-so-painful, I would be very grateful and less inclined to draw pictures of sad kittens all the time.

For example, I might be making a site for a clown troupe who has 6 clowns, 5 jugglers and a contortionist.  The client wants to have an ""Our people"" that lists each member by type. So...

 I would create a new custom post type of ""Our people"" and a custom taxonomy of ""type of entertainer"". Then I would add ""Juggler"", ""Clown"" and ""Contortionist"" to that taxonomy, and possibly some custom fields like ""Persons Name"" and ""Contact Email"".  On the add/edit ""Our People"" page you would see options for assigning to the taxonomy, and any applicable custom fields. Then in the template I would loop through ""Our People"" using PHP (and the Wordpress API) to sort and display the entries w/custom fields on the front end...

I have a site profile which I run a drush site install on, this then loads up a bunch of modules, including some features I have created.

My issue appears to come from the following scenario:

1. Feature loads vocabularies into Drupal

2. My custom module runs which adds terms to the vocabularies (doing a taxonomy_import)

3. Other Features run

Now I am having a few issues... Firstly comes in number 2. For some reason I need to run drupal_flush_all_caches() before doing my Database query to get the correct vocabulary id to add the terms to, or else I get no results back??? In doing the flush all caches, it causes none of my strongarm variables to get set from the other features.

Secondly, If I remove the flush, and just allow it to add the taxonomy terms to a new vocabulary, then it works fine, but this doesn't allow me to control when additional terms get added, and maintaining those when term id's are used in views etc, as the IDs may change on the next site install...

Has anyone come across this before with the drupal_flush_all_caches() and strongarm?

Thanks

1346337897.0	z2umd	My site keeps crashing on Dreamhost. I have a couple of questions.	aenimalius	14	2	31	"Background:

I've built a Drupal 7 site for a small, focused community where most users are logged in (so there's little to no caching), and there are rarely over 30 users at a time. The same server hosts an icecast stream for two hours every morning. This stream has about 60 to 70 listeners on any given day. The site and stream have one vps, the database is on its own vps.

Here are the questions: 

* How much ram should a setup like this use? It seems like no matter how much I throw at it, I'll max it out and the site and stream will crash (due to an automatic reboot when the allotted resources are maxed out) during the peak of the broadcast, when the website is most active. I've easily exceeded 1500 mb in the mornings. That seems excessive to me. I don't think it's icecast that's using all of that, because top shows a bunch of php and apache processes using large chunks of ram, and icecast is usually toward the bottom of the list.

* I'm thinking of moving away from Dreamhost to AWS (for the automatic scaling) or Linode, but I'm not really a server admin and wouldn't know how to optimize or harden a server. What experiences have you all had with those services wrt to drupal? Do they have preconfigured setups for web hosting that are optimized and secure? Would I have to become a Linux wizard (or at least significantly more savvy than I am now) to run the site successfully on one of those services? Whatever I end up doing, I need to do it quickly.

I'm almost to the point where I'm wondering if I'm burnt out or just flat out wrong because my default position on most things is ""Thats a stupid idea!""  I don't usually just come out and say it, I try to suggest a reasonable alternative that accomplishes the same task, but sometimes there is just no winning.

It wouldn't make much of a difference, only that when you have something that is a common practice on the web, there is probably a drupal module for it.  Stray into some absurd territory and now you have to write, debug, and maintain your own module.  Do this enough and it gets prohibitively expensive.  I'm not talking about a couple custom tpl files or a hook here or there to do something straightforward, I'm talking about Rube Goldberg level contraptions.

As an example, today someone wanted to greet new users with a welcome screen *before they log in*, and they are going to display information like the persons email address, so they need a way of getting that information there without having privacy issues.  The rational way to do it is to let the user *log in*, because that's what authentication is for!  You could use logintoboggin to sign them in on account creation then redirect them, or if you require admin approval just forward new users over to that page after you've approved and they log in the first time.

Either is an easy way of handling it and having a welcome page.  Instead the route chosen is to use cookies to store the UID of the user in the cookie, and to pull that value from the cookie when landing on the page and probably use some ajax to do the rest.  This to me seems like a horrible idea, and a complete waste of time.  Given the experience level of the person asking the questions, its going to require days of IRC spoon feeding to get the module to a point where it works if it ever does, and who knows what odd quirks or security holes will come with it.  I'm sure it will be glorious for all 5 people that see it though.

This might seem like making a big deal out of nothing, but after seeing this type of decision made over and over and over again, then clients (or people in #drupal-support) start to cuss out drupal for how horrible it is, because they've hacked it up with a lot of custom code or won't do something simple like install views (I dont wanna use extra modules waaaaaaaa!).  Clients complain about the price, and people trying to build the sites complain because... they just don't fucking work at the end of the day when you apply this style of anti-pattern liberally.

I fully understand that some will feel ""if a client is paying, you do what you're told"", but the problem is ""I told you so"" doesn't do you much good 6 months later.  I feel a responsibility to try to head these issues off, but at the same time arguing with clients (or random people in support) just isn't helpful.  At a certain point of absurdity, it would be like going into a restaurant and insisting that the chef shit on your plate, or telling someone at the honda dealership that you want a car with a propeller on it.

In #drupal-support, I'll often suggest someone go use a framework instead of Drupal if they are going to fight it every step of the way.  Its a rather cheeky suggestion though because I know that they don't have the needed skill to roll their own site out of a framework, or they wouldn't be trying to create frankendrupal.  I could understand it if we were talking about a major feature of the site, but often people tend to get stuck bikeshedding on almost irrelevant details.

So what does everyone else think?  Do you feel like you say no far too often, try to say yes, and then just end up saying no because of the types of requests you receive?  Or do you just build it how the client wants then tell them to fuck off when it collapses later?"	t5_2qhl5	True

Over the past few weeks I've been learning how to use git to version control my drupal development, and I love it. However, I've noticed (realized) that simply pushing/pulling the code doesn't exactly migrate the whole site from my local dev environment, to my staging/production server. DUH!

So, what is the best way to handle the database side of things? Can I include the database in my git repo? Or, can I use the git repo to push/pull the code, and use some other module or tool (preferably command line- love me some drush!) to handle the database?

Or, am I going about this all wrong, and there is a much better way I haven't learned about yet?

1328312844.0	p9ypa	New to Drupal, had a few questions...	mushroomjazzy	12	1	28	"Hey there!

So, as the title says I'm new the drupal and new to pretty much creating a web-page in general. The last time I did so, was 6 years ago in Dreamweaver for a class project. However, I armed myself with some books that one of my roomies had, read through them, retained little, used them as guides to try something out on xampp, realized it was horrible, and found out about CMSes.

Now, my questions are: Where do you find your themes for Drupal? Are there any other places besides the ones listed in their themes? 

Also, the website I plan to build would be a community site (for my friends and I who are gamers), and I was thinking that perhaps a forum would be the best way to handle this. Through research, I've found out that there aren't many bridges for Drupal to phpbb (there's one for bb2, not bb3), vB, or any other ones. Do any of you know good ones? Is the native drupal forum good enough if I tweak it via the suggestions in the discussion on the drupal website?

**TL:DR** New to building websites, wondering where good themes are, any suggestions on forums?

**EDIT** Thanks for the all the responses! I'm pouring through them, and all the discussions."	t5_2qhl5	True
1323575391.0	n84e5	First D7 website, Help!	wwwatson	12	1	15	"Hey there /r/drupal. 

So I've seen the occasional ""help me build my website"" post and now I figured it's time to throw my name into the goblet of fire as well. Basically, what I need is a compass. I am a long way from finishing this project (got an instance of D7 working on my laptop where I'll be doing the work and that's about it), and I'd love a little help figuring out where to go from here. 

The project I'm working on is a completely new website for a New York based non-profit working with impoverished musicians in India. The organization is very small and the director isn't tech-oriented, so the websites (3 of them, 2 are distinct sub-projects) are looking old and outdated, and often go months or years without a refresh. I figured that using Drupal would give her and her interns the ability to keep the website up to date with the minimum amount of tech knowledge needed. 

That being said, I'm unsure how to proceed in building the site. I've made a very basic mock-up of [what I want the site to look like in general](http://imgur.com/w7IlU). (Not the colors I'm using.) Essentially, this will be the theme of the entire site, as I'm not looking to get too complicated. Going off the image as a guide, I want to build a site that has a user bar in the top right corner, a header, a navigation pane, a content pane and a footer. 

The user bar simply has to link to three separate pages - search, register and log in. The header bar contains the logo and a donate button and does not change with each page. The navigation pane (light purple) contains links (dark pink) to each distinct page. I also want to be able to add new stories to the 'News' page instead of the 'Home' page. When a reader hovers over each page link, I want a box (dark purple) with links (light pink) to appear to the right of the link, above the content pane (green). Finally, the footer at the bottom remains the same for each page. 

So, /r/drupal, what I really need to know is where to begin. How do I build my own theme? How do I tell Drupal to organize the page links in the way I want them? How do I submit stories to the 'News' page instead of the 'Home' page? And finally, is there any advice you want to give a beginner before I get in way over my head?

Thanks, I really appreciate it!

1366907285.0	1d3agp	I'm redoing my organization's website, I fear I may have to ditch Drupal.	Will_Power	13	4	24	"**Edit: I had discovered this subreddit less than a day before I wrote this post.  I have to say, the responses have been sensational.  This is a great little subreddit.  My sincere thanks to everyone who responded.**

Let me see if I can give a brief enough backstory for my dilemma to make sense.  A little over five years ago, I started a new job at an organization (not a business) where I quickly became the de facto technical guy, even though that wasn't what I was hired to do.  The place didn't have a website at all, and one of my early tasks was to create one.  

Now I had been a Linux user for several years by this point, and had dabbled in PHP and MySQL as well as a little system administration, but wasn't given too much direction on what they wanted.  I decided that since the majority of my job *wasn't* IT, I would go for a CMS so everyone in the organization could contribute.  (I was pretty naive about the level of involvement I was going to get.)  

I did some research and was impressed by Drupal.  ""sudo apt-get install drupal"" later, I had a test site up, and a DNS change later, our site was live.  (I'm minimizing the effort it took to get this far, but you get the idea.)

So there was our Drupal 6 site with its basic Garland theme, with its basic blog-like format.  I added a few simple pages with links in the left sidebar, including a contact page.  It wasn't anything spectacular, but we had a website for the first time ever!  People were happy.  My legend grew. 

Here we are five years later, and the site hadn't changed much.  Not only did very few people contribute, but I got very little feedback on the direction people wanted the site to go.  Scratch that last part.  I got *no* feedback on where they wanted it to go... 

...until a few weeks ago.  I was notified that we needed a new site and that I was to write the RFP (Request For Proposal) that would go out to bid.  I was (finally) given some direction on what they wanted the site to do and look like.

So, despite the kick to the gut (essentially being told that what I set up was all wrong), I started to work.  They wanted a more informational, traditional looking site, and one that was less of an ever-changing content page.

As I started putting the RFP together, something kept nagging at me.  I finally realized what it was.  No matter who built the site, in the end,  I was going to be the one administering it.  I further realized that whoever wins the bid will probably slap something together with RoR or Laravel or some other framework.  I've tried to learn those things, but they are confusing as hell, and I don't have the time or energy to start from scratch in trying to understand them.

So here I am, past my deadline, still with misgivings on the RFP.  It occurred to me that perhaps I could give Drupal 7 a try.  If I could make a site like they asked for, why should they care what powered it?  If I could pull off the site redesign without an RFP, my waning legend would return in full force!  (Full disclosure: no one really understands websites enough to care.  The whole ""legend"" thing is more self image than anything else.)  I dove into redesigning the site myself, sure that I could bend Drupal to the new vision of our site.

Alas, I am frustrated.  The Ubuntu repository lags the current Drupal release, so test sites bitch incessantly about the need to upgrade.  Drush is new since my install five years ago, but upgrading a repository install with Drush breaks all kinds of shit.  I finally figured out how to do a site install with Drush, but it took various ""chown"" and file modification tricks to finally get the damn thing working.  Still, I got the test site working in the end.  If that were the only problem, I wouldn't be writing what is no longer a brief post right now.

What troubles me is trying to customize the site.  For example, I wanted to include a slideshow on the front page.  I grabbed all the prerequisite modules via drush, enabled them... and then the work began.  I couldn't find any good documentation about what to do once the modules were installed and in place.  I eventually found some YouTube videos that got me part of a slideshow, but to finish off the pager involves editing what appears to be 352 css files.  (Actual count may be lower.)  So now I have a slideshow with a column of numbers below it, and apparently I'm just starting up the learning curve.

That's just one example.  Things like trying to get a horizontal menu bar with submenus have proven just as challenging, though I haven't spent nearly as much time with them as I have with the slideshow component.

So what say you all?  Am I in over my head?  Should I just bow my head, bury my pride, and write the damned RFP despite my misgivings about site maintenance in the long term?  Or is customizing the look and feel of a Drupal 7 site not as bad as my initial experiences are making it seem?"	t5_2qhl5	True
1366466074.0	1cqo3h	Interesting cause of problem with lock_acquire in drupal 6	DrunkenCodeMonkey	10	0	7	"I've finally located an annoying bug that was preventing me from enabling any new module I downloaded to my test server (as well as a bunch of other symptoms that where hard to identify).

The problem was that no locks where being acquired, so new modules were not be added to the {system} table, and as such could not be marked as enabled (the enable code uses an update call).

The problem in lock_acquire is a ""%f"" format used on the $expire variable. My system renders %f as integer,decimal and not integer.decimal, which is not correct mysql syntax.

This is of course due to having set the locale to se.SE, or if it's sv.SV or whatever, inside a module which I suppose is not supported by drupal.

I'm not done researching recommended practices yet, and I'm going to stop for lunch now, but I figure someone else might also consider this interesting and if I spark a small discussion I will end up getting good advice.

I'll probably end up changing my module to only update the locale locally, which should counter the issue. I'm not terribly happy that drupal takes issue with a setting that should be display side only, but for all I know it's been fixed in D7 or 8.

I've got it set up locally and I have a basic structure set up (header, footer, basic CSS) but now I'm struggling with understand the structure of the site. Having just got my head round Wordpress, I'm finding Drupal very unintuitive.
 
First off, I've identified a need for 11 widgets. E.g ""portfolio tall"" and ""portfolio wide"" to display portfolio images (one for a vertical lister and one for horizontal) etc
 
I've then got 6 different templates or layouts identified. Homepage, two col, one col, inner page with lots of widget areas, portfolio entry page and an inner page with only a few widget areas (I've drawn out every page and worked out each type that needs to be available to get these numbers.)
 
From my understanding (Drupal documentation seems to go way over my head) you don't have it the same way as Wordpress, where your two col layout can have different widgets in it. Can anyone tell me if this is right?
 
For example, I need a two col layout with a portfolio widget down the side. I then need a two col layout with an advert down the side. Does this have to be two different pages? Or can I just make one ""two col"" template and add widgets to it depending on what page it is? Argh, so confusing!

I taught myself CSS and HTML about six months ago and have been working with Drupal for about four months attempting to build a website with some pretty granular functional specs based on my business model.

Conceptually, Drupal seems like the absolutely perfect tool.  Custom content types, views, panels, taxonomy, custom user permissions, etc.  Brilliant!  However, I always seem to run into areas where custom development is needed - some critical functionality is missing or outside the capabilities of ""x"" module.

So, here's my question.  What I've run into is this... out of the box, Drupal and Wordpress are (for a non-coder) functionally identical.  I can get Wordpress to do pretty much the same things I can get in Drupal with plugins and modules, etc.  In fact, Wordpress actually has a few more of the critical functionalities specific to my business model from a data standpoint.

However, I see the greater flexibility in Drupal's system.  But, as a non-profecient coder, I can't really take advantage of that.

I've heard people talk about Drupal as a framework more than a CMS, and I can see why.  I also see why developers love Drupal.  The ""you don't need to know how to code"" argument is mute when you compare Drupal to other CMS's.  Because, I've found functionality nearly identical (speaking of WP vs Drupal) when using plugins and modules.

So, my question is this... if Drupal is a framework, and I need a list of specific functionalities, what is the advantage to learning the inner workings of Drupal vs learning a no shit PHP framework?

I recently finished college.  I turned down opportunities at conventional software dev jobs to enter the world of Drupal Development,  where I'd be able to create my own things have more say over my future.  Some of these software opportunities were at well known tech companies with great salaries.

I just found out my $25/hr salary as a contractor is far less than I thought it was due to federal income tax, state income tax, and self employment tax. I've never had a full time job outside of school (only part time), so I figured the tax rate would be something like 15%.  It's actually 33%.  WTF.   This is pretty disheartening because I burdened myself with loans to go to a ""prestigious"" private school, and I was hoping to pay them off much much faster than a 30 year schedule.   The calculation looks like this:  gross income is $48000 per year.  After state and federal income taxes, my salary comes to $38000.  $38000 minus $5400 for self employment taxes = 32600!    Wow!  This my salary calculation for Oregon, where I hope to move (just in time for DrupalCon!)  I'm currently in Austin, Texas.  But jeez, that no state income tax sure sounds nice.

So, that's the context for this question:  what CORE skills should I focus on to rapidly raise my value?  HOWTODOIT?

Here's my skillset:
* About 1.5 years casual Drupal experience (mainly working with admin interface, views, custom theme development, modules), and a few months of custom module dev (Created Android app that interacts with Drupal site)  Still, overall, on the front end of the learning curve. 
 * Top flight design skills (I started out as a graphics designer. Not sure how much this helps b/c graphics designers don't get paid as much as developers).  I'd like to think it helps.
* Android Mobile Development experience

Given the reality of how much I'm actually earning, and how incredibly important it is to pay off my school loans, I'd appreciate your advice on rapidly raising my value.  I'm currently learning JQuery to enhance my skillset.

1296857703.0	ffgrx	Just started with Drupal, but I have a LOT of specific needs for my site.  Many questions inside.	demesisx	10	1	13	"I am a professional cinematographer in the process of designing my own site to showcase my work for perspective clients.  I have decided on but not fully committed to learning Drupal 7 (until I know that I am not just asking for miracles from something that can't provide them).  Yes, I know a lot of the modules aren't yet available for Drupal 7, but I heard that migration from 6 to 7 will be a lot of hard work and figured, ""why don't I just start with the latest and most evolved/elegant version?  I have no deadline and using a CMS would make my site more efficient to update on the road.""  I plan on theming with Zen (when it's ready) to make it work with a design I am laying out at the moment.
There will be 5 or 6 parts to the site: video viewer/homepage, music browser, photo browser, blog, a client log-in, and eventually a part to sell my own gadgets and film inventions. 
The part of the site that I need most help with is the most important to me.  It's the part where I show my own video work.  A friend of mine designed [his own site](http://www.thufford.com/reel/) (hard coded most of it) and used some Flash, JQuery, and other elements to get it looking slick.  I absolutely love the layout for what I intend to do with my own video browser and he offered it to me for free.  However, his site:

1. runs Flash, which doesn't work on mobile platforms like Android and iOs (absolutely crucial to a person involved with film/video people who are always on those devices)
2. requires lots of work and alterations to the site to update even a little bit
3. doesn't automatically sense the device you're accessing it from (as many CMS's can be configured to do) and therefore, doesn't lay it out specifically for that device
4. doesn't automatically populate the viewer with new videos based on submission date (from a custom video content type, of course)
5. doesn't allow one to add vimeo-based videos in those submissions

I looked at WordPress and came away from that research with a big HELL NO! 
Then, I dove right in to Joomla and found Mootools and the Joomla's overall code creation to be sloppy and TERRIBLE.  After about a week of experimenting and coming up with utter garbage pages, I quickly left Joomla.  
Then, I looked into it and found that Drupal works with JQuery, is nice and quick/modern, and produces REALLY elegant markup (for the most part).  I've been lurking here ever since.  I've also been thinking about going over to a Drupal meetup at MIT to ask some questions, but I don't want to sound like a fool with my newb questions.

The reason why I actually have to ask whether this is possible is I noticed that Drupal sites all have a pretty standard layout and I'd like mine to be much different.  I don't want ANY navigation text or drop down menus on my site.  The only text will be that of my blog, the blurbs explaining the multimedia content, my contact info, and resume (but I also want the entire site to be SE Optimized...).  I want all of the page section links to be in the right sidebar and I want them to just be icons as well as the navigation arrows for video, music, and photos.  I may need to have different sections with text to classify types of photos, music, or videos, but even that seems ugly to me (for example, in photos, there would be landscapes, portraits, weddings, etc).

Now, the specific questions I have for you amazing experts over here:

1. Is this feasible?
2. Is there a better CMS that would allow for such a thing more easily?  (I looked at Mediacore, but it wasn't as configurable and didn't have nearly the community behind it.  I'm doing this to learn Drupal for pro work as well as to build my own site.)
3. How long will it be until Drupal 7's modules are up to the standard that I'm wishing for?

Also, what modules (that are soon be compatible with 7) should I use that will help with: 

4. device dependent layouts
5. slideshow implementations similar to my friend's site (with the ability to play nice with vimeo videos.  Preferably, I would want to be able to add one just by typing in the url of the vimeo page in question and then having that auto populate the slideshow with the thumbnails and such)
6. non-text based navigation
7. image caching
8. urls to page sections that are simple and linkable (for example: ""www.websitename.com/film"") 

Thanks in advance.  If it's too much to answer, I understand completely.  I've lurked for far too long and I stopped working on this site altogether in November....until today.

Edit:  thanks so much for all of this, guys.  I am noticing that one of my more specific design elements might be rather difficult to implement (I'm talking about image-based navigation).  It's a shame that this is so difficult to do.  I think it's one of the reasons why really fancy designs don't get made in Drupal a lot of the time.  Drupal seems great for infrastructure, but beauty doesn't seem to be its strong suit.  Maybe that's because it's mostly used by more right brained people, perhaps."	t5_2qhl5	True

Apologies if this is not How It Is Done.

My question concerns module development. I've been reading up on this and watching screencasts, and I get the impression that modules are considered a good solution pretty quickly. My question is: **what would one consider the point where creating a module is preferable to mucking about in template.php (with includes, perhaps) and creating custom tpl.php files?**

Here is the impression that I get, as a novice drupal user:

* When you find that you're writing significant amounts of code that you might use again in other sites, write it as a module.
* When the above is not the case, but you find that you're creating custom tpl.php files *and* adding stuff to template.php, consolidate it in a module unless it's just a few lines.
* even when the above is not the case, but you're writing significant amounts of code peppered all over template.php (because of different functions), consider creating a module.

So, for example, if you want to implement a custom breadcrumb, you could just add a few lines to template.php. If you want to expose the custom breadcrumb to the site manager through a form where he can select the breadcrumb delimiter, you will have to write at least custom breadcrumb code *and* code that uses the form API. Even in this case, without any database changes, a module might be a cleaner solution. Especially if you intend to re-use this code.

Am I correct in my assessment? Can anyone explain why I might not be? Do modules have performance drawbacks that I'm not aware of?

EDIT: Thanks for the answers! If I read correctly, a module is the correct approach almost all the time when adding any kind of 'feature' to a site."	t5_2qhl5	True

I've installed Drupal on my server and have going through [Getting Started with OpenLayers in Drupal 7](https://drupal.org/node/1481374) and [Import and Map over 5000 points of interest in 45 minutes](http://drupaleasy.com/blogs/ultimike/2013/04/import-map-over-5000-points-interest-45-minutes). 

To get over the issue of having so many points and to not overwhelm the system when the users load the maps I'm also going to use [Views GeoJSON](https://drupal.org/project/views_geojson) to only show points that are currently within the Maps view.

After these tutorials I think I understand at least the very basics of OpenLayers and Drupal. It's also let me in a day do more then what I did as a proof of concept using completely custom Jquery and PHP, so far everything looks extremely positive.

To summarise what I need from this project:

* Anonymous user or registered public user goes to the website, zooms to the area they're interested in and selects a node, this brings up a letter that they can print, save or email
* Administrator can log in and upload new or updated chunks of data by CSV, probably 30,000 records at a time (I expect this to happen every couple of months)


It seems like everything I want can be thrown together in Drupal without major investment in custom coding.

I hope the following question isn't too elementary. I""m very new to drupal and some searching / digging on the web hasn't yielded much results.

I recently installed Drupal for the first time and am trying to use it on a very content-heavy site of mine. My site will have 50-75 (possibly more pages) and another couple hundred articles (eventually).

My question is this: What is the best way to organize and manage this content within Drupal? I started adding content, only to find that after about 25 pages were created it became an arduous task to find the right article to edit or modify, or to simply see what articles belonged to a specific category. Basically, all of the content is in one huge list and the options to filter it out don't help much because I really only have two basic content types (basic pages and articles - I don't really have a need for more from a layout perspective). I know that you can find/edit content by logging in and simply browsing the site, but is there any way to create a hierarchy of content so that it's a bit easier in the admin/backend?

So, should I use ""taxonomies"" to categorize content? Is that the right solution?

Or, do I create custom content-types (similar to article or basic page) for each category of content so that I can drill down and filter it in the content listing?

What's the best way to attack this? Seems like this should be at the heart of drupal, but maybe I'm just not getting it.

Calibas	16	6	19	"This might be a good opportunity to breathe some new life into this subreddit, bring people together, and also attract more members here. I was considering creating a module that adds the options for ""Previous/Next"" buttons for nodes. This is a feature many other CMSs have automatically, but it's been missing from Drupal and there's currently no simple way of implementing it.

Fortunately, someone has already created an [API for this](http://drupal.org/project/prev_next), so the hardest part is already done. A user here, [mynameispj](http://www.reddit.com/user/mynameispj), posted a [guide](http://www.pjmccormick.com/words/next-previous-node-links-drupal-7) on how to implement the API within a theme, and I've taken his work and turned it into a very basic module so it's not dependent upon a theme.

I got a job a little over a month ago, a full time gig as a web developer. Well at first things were easy, and I blew them away. Lately I have been hitting walls, getting errors, and problems with ubercart.

After this job going so well, we (wife, baby and me) decided to move out of the in-laws and get our own apartment. I am afraid if I don't get some of these issues cleared up fast, I may get let go and lose the apartment. 

What I need is someone out there who knows drupal, views, maybe even ubercart. I have posted on freelancer and odesk with no good employees so far.

This is my issue, and I am not asking for a hand out, I will pay, but I am somewhat limited at the moment.

Some of the errors:

First:

I'd like to bulk update all products in the store to have inventory marked ""active"". I went to mysql, ran and replacement command, and that worked for the ones in the uc_stock(something like this) table, but not all products show up in that table, so I don't know how to durn on inventory for the products not in that table.

Second:

Views is making the site throw a 500 error if accessed from other web software like yahoo site explorer, or websitegrader.com. I am going to try and raise my php memory limit in a bit and see if that helps.

If you are advanced at drupal and know how to fix these issues please message me. I'm so depressed and worried recently that I may lose this job. Thanks in advanced Reddit. 

Update to 500 error. I paid someone to do this and this was the results:

&gt;Problem has been resolved. The error was caused by these two blocks:
&gt;Block 1
&gt;Block 2
&gt;
&gt;Which had been set to Input Format: PHP Code. But because both those blocks contains Javascript which PHP cannot evaluate. Instead, the Input Format: Full HTML should be used where there is HTML and Javascript code. Only use Input Format: PHP Code when there is actually PHP to be executed.


I also fixed the ubercart bulk update problem with a couple things I found online, one was a SQL command which made stock monitoring marked ""active"" for all products, the next was a module from ubercarts website which allowed me to mass update quantities.

I was hired to create PSD's for our developers offshore, but when my boss learned I knew html/css, we decided I would write that and send it off, as well.

We use Drupal. I don't know much about it, so I did research and made sure our developers could take my html/css and then put in the Drupal code - and my research says they can. All is good.

I sent off my first project to our developers, and when he sent me the link to look at it, my original html and css had been hacked...pretty significantly. There were many changes, some the structure of the page (a masthead not spanning the browser width, but now only spanning the 960px container), and some easy stuff like font-family, size, etc. I asked him why he had edited what I wrote, showed him the research links I had found about converting a static html/css file into a Drupal theme, and he told me that was ""for beginners."" And he was using an existing theme, and going to modify it for this site.

To me, this seems like more work, especially if the theme isn't a replica of what I sent him. Am I wrong? He responded to me by saying ""Most Drupal developers just modify existing themes"" -- I would imagine this to be untrue?

My real question is, to Drupal developers, is it easier for you to just hack an existing theme to get it to look like a psd or static html/css, or is it easier to take the html/css someone wrote and then put in the Drupal code?

I need some help from all of you superstars who work daily with timeline constraints and Drupal. I'm really, really trying to avoid a bitchfest on my part and get rid of this pessimistic inner dialogue that has been running for the past few weeks.

Basically, I'm really struggling with an accurate timeline for how long things take to build in Drupal.

Here's the situation at a glance:

1. My background: I work for a library system in the United States as the web designerâmy skillset is firmly in design/UX/html/css but I'm very comfortable with building content types, views, etc as well as using PHP as required for custom theming. I freelanced prior to this position.
2. I'm responsible for planning, building and testing the content types, views (and other stuff like contexts, Features, etc), UX, theming, cross browser compatibility, accessibility, and some training.
3. I have a coworker who is new to Drupal but was a PHP developer in a previous job. She has been a superstar and has helped out considerably with building the content types and will be assisting with creating the Views and has set up our Feeds with our 3rd-party calendar vendor and 3rd-party catalog (Bibliocommons). 
4. We're both new to Features and having been using this for our workflowâwe had to recently rebuild a lot of our Features to incorporate Strongarm and fix conflicts but it's all pretty much golden now. We're using Github for version control (also both new to using).
5. Website redesign overview: roughly 50 pages (not including blog posts from our assortment of blogs), 6 main unique stakeholders who communicate with 2-3 department stakeholders in regards to content.

Our remaining timeline before soft launch is 3 weeks, which includes building all of the views pages and blocks, theming (+ accessibility), cross-browser compatibility testing, and usability testing. We've been at it for about two months so far, but a lot of that time was spent spinning our wheels waiting for page tables from stakeholders and then converting that into a list of content types, taxonomy and establishing the info arch for each of those sections. Unfortunately for me (because this is one of my favorite parts of a redesign), I was told by my superior that information architecture was not my responsibility. However, the info arch was not completed and I am currently rushing to get it established so I can see the tokens for paths (pathauto) as well as which pages need to be created in Views.

I'm okay with providing more information if necessary and please, please, PLEASE don't hesitate to criticize anything I've said because it will only help with efficiency.

Thanks for taking the time to read.

TL;DR: Lots of stuff still yet to do in a big redesign project. Time is running out. What are acceptable timelines for when things should be accomplished? Being general is okay. Ask for more details and I shall provide."	t5_2qhl5	True

I'd like to add a few things to it, and I am unsure exactly how - Regex is not my thing.

First of all, we get a ton of requests to our old ad server (no idea why).  So I'd like to add something for the following urls (or anything in that old openx directory, really):

    openx/www/delivery/lg.php
    openx/www/delivery/spc.php
    openx/www/delivery/ck.php
    openx/www/delivery/ajs.php

Second, we get a ton of traffic to our old story pages, and they all have one of these snippets in their url:

    single-publication-story
    single-news-page

Would love to prevent Drupal from rendering an entire page and sending these people to the fast 404 page.  Here is the code from settings.php:

     * Drupal can generate fully themed 404 pages. However, some of these responses
     * are for images or other resource files that are not displayed to the user.
     * This can waste bandwidth, and also generate server load.
     *
     * The options below return a simple, fast 404 page for URLs matching a
     * specific pattern:
     * - 404_fast_paths_exclude: A regular expression to match paths to exclude,
     *   such as images generated by image styles, or dynamically-resized images.
     *   If you need to add more paths, you can add '|path' to the expression.
     * - 404_fast_paths: A regular expression to match paths that should return a
     *   simple 404 page, rather than the fully themed 404 page. If you don't have
     *   any aliases ending in htm or html you can add '|s?html?' to the expression.
     * - 404_fast_html: The html to return for simple 404 pages.
     *
     * Add leading hash signs if you would like to disable this functionality.

Using Entity API is great because the data is made available to Views, Rules, and other methods on the data are made available. However, it is so complicated there isn't an easy access point to making homemade entities. I have successfully used the Entity Construction Kit with a few hacks but would like to create entities from scratch. I hope they make this easier in Drupal 8.

1368558120.0	1ebyac	Seeking input on using Drupal Commerce, or creating my own module / entity...	shaniacthemaniac	10	1	9	"I'm trying to allow (wholesale) customers to place an order on our website that will handle customization within the product beyond what Commerce seems capable of out of the box.  

In particular, a customization allowing an addition of artwork to be printed where the price per unit increases by $0.50 * the number of pieces of art they want to include (so they enter 9 -&gt; price increases by $4.50 per unit).  I also want to allow the artwork to be uploaded (jpg, pdf, png) and attached to the order.

My original thought was to create a new entity, create my own form, use views to display information, etc.  Looking over commerce code as to how they implement entities it seems like I might be better off trying to create my own Line Type and continue to use commerce.

Does anyone here have experience with doing either?  I need to implement a solution robust enough to allow integration with sugarcrm, quickbooks, and fedex further down the line (one thing at a time) and as such figured a new entity would be the best solution.  The downside would be having to write a bunch of code (to handle customer communication, history, displaying information about their order, etc) that already exists in things like commerce.

I'd rather not reinvent the wheel, but don't want to severely limit myself either.  Any thoughts would be appreciated!"	t5_2qhl5	True

**Edit** Sorry guys, I should have provided some more background! We're on a Dreamhost dedicated server. We see about 7k pageviews in an average month. We're using Boost right now. No unnecessary modules are installed. We are not currently using Varnish, Memcache/d, or APC because we don't have a *nix admin who can install them for us (DH tech support will not), and I'm loathe to accidentally screw something up on our server.

**Unsure how to determine where the bottleneck is. Doing a pingdom site load speed test, I get something like this on average:**

7.87s to load

Connect: 144ms

Some pages of my site have a list of downloadable PDFs of brochures.

On these pages, the body is ignored completely. It's not just hidden in CSS or removed in JS. It's gone.

So I figure I need to learn Drupal. The other option is Joomla, but from what I read, support is getting less and less each day.

So should I start with six or seven? I did search this subreddit and found a couple of threads, but they were over a year old and so I expect they may no longer be so relevant to today's version 7.

Consider this example:
1) I pull the mysql db from live to dev
2) I pull the basecode from live to dev

So I am now synced

I begin to develop on dev (lets say I am adding a content type)

While I am developing someone leaves a comment on the live site, or adds contents, or does some sort of update. 

3) Now I am done developing and I push from dev to testing (or to live) since I made database changes (added a content type) I need to push that as well. 

When I push, it is going to remove any of the content being placed there when I was developing.

I know I can not be the only person with this problem, so I must be doing something wrong.  

Obviously, I could just add the content type in the live site -- but that seems to defeat the purpose of having a dev/test/live setup. 

So any links, modules, experience, help with this?

Thanks!

Atomyk	10	2	10	"I am setting up a new drupal site but was having issues getting Clean URLS to work (even though apache settings &amp; .htaccess are the same as other Drupal sites on server). Host said it was because I was accessing site at ip.#/~user/ instead of a domain. I asked about setting up a sub.domain and received this reply:

&gt; Greetings

&gt; ""If I was to setup an A record for dev.domain.ca pointed to ip# how would I get that to resolve to this account? ""

&gt; Since your using WHM there is an easier way. Simply setup dev.domain.ca as a 'parked domains' ontop of your current software install.

&gt; Also, please note. Drupal is very sensitive. Anything you setup using this temp domain is not going to to transfer over to your primary url when you point it at the server. It will still rely on the dev. script path.

&gt; Generally speaking, its normally a very bad idea to attempt to setup drupal without first having a fully qualified domain name on the server in order to house it.
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; Level 2 Tech Support

Does this seem wrong to anyone else? I'm a bit concerned as I haven't used WHM much before. I've never had any issues mirroring my document root with a separate domain during development and waiting until site is ready before redirecting clients domain. At I about to shoot myself in the foot or is drupal safely contained in it's root  and I can point whatever domain structure I want at it?

**TL;DR** Host say developing drupal site under sub.domain will break when going live, sounds wrong to me but I don't want to F myself over.

Should I use Drupal w/ heavy module manipulation, or build my own âCMSâ for a very specifically tasked web tool.  	cornflaik	14	4	14	"I am building a tool to be used in an existing website that will displays information about a companies products. I need to make to tool that lets public viewers of the site look up information about the companyâs products, and I need to create a web interface for the users to make content entries. My though is to use Drupal as a clean efficient method of handling the information. Unfortunately I am only a small step above n00b, but I think with enough research I can do itâ¦ I feel like molding into the Drupal environment will elevate my methods. On the other hand I feel like I could also figure out enough PHP to make the tool from scratch.

    The way I look at it is that I need to build a dirt buggy, I have a car I can take apart and rework to be a good buggy, or I have all the sheet metal, bolts, and other parts I need to make a buggy from scratchâ¦ witch one should I do, considering I am learning how the tools, and buggy work as I build itâ¦?
    
    Description of the tool: I need to make to tool that lets public viewers of the site look up information about the companyâs products, and I need to create a web interface for the users to make content entries. The content I am displaying ranges from:
   -Product Images with SVG overlay and rollover buttons to info
   -Download links 
   -Product text, specs, directions, troubleshooting, ectâ¦ ( About 5 pages of text broken into 11 Categories per item)

Coming from the world of WP, mind=blown. So what are some guidelines in creating custom content types for maximum flexibility and usability? (If you make it too broad, you'll end up doing more work per node. If you make it too narrow, you'll have a gazillion content types). When do you make a custom content type versus just working with what you have?

The project I am considering using Drupal for is not a traditional web site, I am most interested in using only Drupal's content management features. I do not want to publish anything to the front end of the site, at a later stage I will want to expose content via restricted RSS / XML feeds, but I have no need for a website front end except perhaps a single page with a login form.

I have succeeded in creating Content Types for the sorts of content which I wish to store, but when I click the title of an item in the dashboard, I am sent to the front end of the site to view it. Likewise, upon publishing a new piece of content, I am sent to the front end of the site to view / edit it. I do not want administrative users to ever be sent to the front end of the site, how can I prevent this from happening?

So I always hit my head on my desk at the idea of filling in a field again. You know, when you reuse a field in a new content type, there's no defaults. By which I mean, all the fields such as description, length and other node-type-specific properties are empty/arbitrary defaults. Only the label is reused. All the non-type-specific options are reused, but that's because they're global for a field and cannot reasonably be changed (allowed number of values, etc).

It seems to me there should be a setting somewhere that you can activate (and really, that's active by default), that would allow you not to have to fill in the same description every time. If I'm reusing the same field, it only makes sense that I'm going to put the same help text on it. Right?

Now, before I get my hands down into code again, I was hoping someone would point out some obscure/obvious solution that I simply haven't thought of. Otherwise, would you be interested in such a module? All suggestions welcome concerning the module's features (not Features *grumble*).

(PS: I'm aware that if I'm using the same field multiple times, it may be a good idea to reevaluate the site architecture, but sometimes that's just how the cookie crumbles.)

I'd like it to be simple for a small number of users to add items much like a normal post or page but have custom fields specific to the type of post they'll be making.

For example, Add Content &gt; Interview. User will have fields such as: Title, interviewer, interviewee, date, location, tags, etc. as well as options to upload video, PDF, images, etc.
 
I am also wondering if it is possible to make these dynamic in the way that if you add an interviewer more than once, on the page this is treated like a tag that you can click on to see all interviews by this person.
 
I understand this is quite basic stuff, but as an absolute beginner with Drupal, I don't have the particular vocabulary to research what exactly I need to do. Any advice as to how to accomplish these tasks, what kind of vocab to use in research, specific modules, walkthroughs and examples to look at, and other general beginner advice specific to setting up an expansive archive would be much appreciated.

We've been doing Drupal for years, but as part of recent push to try and streamline things, as well as stop making mistakes, we're trying to improve our workflow.

Right now we're building using Drupal 7, the Omega theme with Delta+Context, and Display Suite for building sites. We've got programmers for building custom modules, site builders who take care of Views, Content Types, and recently setting up Delta and Context. We then have some people that take care of the CSS and some fine-tuning of the HTML. We constantly run into problems were we have 4 or 5 CSS stylesheets per theme, or people are overwriting others file since we work on one install of Drupal. 

The non-programmers are just that, which was one of the original reasons we moved to Omega, Delta, and Context. This hasn't really helped from a workflow standpoint though.

We're not storing anything in source control, but not for lack of trying. So much of everything is in the database that we're running into walls on how to best handle this. We got ourselves into this a bit deeper by switching to Omega+Delta+Context, which stores layout info in the database. We tried Features but either end up with a ton of features (50-100 on some projects) or a few massive features that tend to break when upgrading. 

What I'm trying to work toward is push-button or even continuous deployment. I've read articles on setting up Jenkins or Aegir for deployment, but nothing much on the workflow leading up to deployment. Does anyone have any good resources on workflows that involve more than 1 or 2 people? 

I'd also like to find something that deals with reconciling having so much in the database. I've been using Backup and Migrate to move databases down (Production -&gt; QA -&gt; Development) but moving up is kind of a pain. Some things can be exported (like Views) but then we're cutting and pasting and that just doesn't work with what I want to move us towards."	t5_2qhl5	True

Mollom takes care of it so 99.9% of them don't get through, but unfortunately the spam still sucks up a whole lot of system resources. Every so often, I get a spammer that tries to post as many comments as they possibly can, multiple ones each second, and this reduces the server to a snail's pace and often crashes it. 

I was wondering if there's any modules to prevent this? For instance, a module that only allows one form submission per IP every 5 seconds for anonymous users? It seems so easy for a malicious user to crash a Drupal site just by hammering pages that take up a lot of resources to generate. When I've researched this, I usually hear this isn't a problem to be solved from within Drupal, and I'm currently looking into putting in place some basic DoS protection on the server, but it still seems to me like it wouldn't be too hard to fix from within Drupal. Am I missing something that's already been implemented?

And I've already done quite a bit to optimize the server, though I'm looking into switching from Boost to Pressflow/Varnish at the moment. My average page generation time for legitimate traffic is roughly 150-250ms, which as far as I understand is pretty quick. I think I've done about as much as I can to speed up the server.

So Drupal will handle the content site, and the buying and processing of subscriptions to the tool(s). Straightforward enough.... But...

I need to also sync user data from the Drupal site when the subscriber purchases a subscription, to the application (again, not drupal).

I had considered a simple API logic when a subscriber purchases a new sub it pushes data via XML (or w/e) to the tool that carries the user's data and the length of the subscription. (this might include Username, Password, Email, Start date and End date, as well as which features to enable). On the tools end, it reads the data stream and checks if the user exists, if not create, if so update with new subscription data.

When it expires the tool will disable the user, and send a notification back to drupal that the user is de-activated.

I realized this only solves some of the problem. When the user moves between the tool and the drupal site, session information may not be preserved. (if logged into one, does not mean it is logged into the other)

For example, classic popcorn, cheddar popcorn, chocolate peanut butter popcorn, etc. They are each a ""Product"" content type and have several sizes (using Inline Entity Form), like 1 gallon tin, 2, 3, 6.5, etc. They are all priced, etc. so that users can select their size and add it to the cart. Works great.

Now what we want to do is build a popcorn sampler. So, for our 2, 3, and 6.5 gallon tins, we want people to be able to select any of our popcorn varieties and charge them accordingly.

So, they can choose classic for flavor 1, cheddar for flavor 2 (+$1.00), and chocolate peanut butter for flavor 3 (+$3.00).

Ideally, when we add a new product/flavor (e.g. let's say we introduce cinnamon popcorn, add the product and sizes, etc.), it would add that option to the flavors for the sampler.

I can't quite seem how to wrap my mind around creating this. I wouldn't even mind going into the sampler to edit and add the new flavors. I can't even find a way to add the three flavor options. Any help is appreciated!"	t5_2qhl5	True

When I look at the sites that are built on Drupal  (http://drupal.org/  is a perfect example). I see that every page on the site has a different layout. The same is true for _all_ sites build on Drupal. So, if anyone can help me on the direction, I would greatly appreciate. Here are the options I have thought about. (i.e. to create a site where _every_  page content layout is different (I am _not_ talking about the menu, search bar, etc, these can stay in the same place, I am talking about the ""center"" of the page has different layouts (images, etc...)

1. Do people use ""Basic page""  and hand code HTML/CSS directly into the ""Basic Page"" text area? (Does not seem this is the way to go)

2. Do people use  ""Basic Page"" and apply their own CSS? (If so, how to accomplish this; i.e. where does the .css go? where do I link/reference the .css file from the page (node)? What do we name the .css? (in other words, how is the .css file linked to the page/node generated by drupal?)

3.  Do people create a new Content Type and layout out fields for images, etc. using ""fields"" ?(even doing this it seems that the only control you have is what comes on top and what comes after, not a true layout).  Does that mean we create a content type for every page? 

4. Do we create a lot of blocks and construct the page with a lot of ""blocks""?

I already know how to create navigation block, search block, menu, footer, etc. I just need to  have a site in where  every  ""page"" has a different layout. Page here means the ""content in the center"" of the page.

Please let me know if you still have question and THANK you so much for any pointers.

-------


**Edit 1**: It seems that there are 2 ways (without having to deal with extra modules) 

1.  Add my own template for each page

* Do we place the templates inside the current theme? if so, ...
* Does it break Drupal's guideline to no edit basic themes?

2. Create a sub-theme (copy everything from Barthick  - in my case -- to the thems directory and change the templates there.)

* Should I copy ""everything"" or just enough for it to be  a sub-theme, and if the current themes does not find a template there, it will look for the template in its own base directory?  There is a theme that does that -- cannot remember the name of the theme though. Do all themes do that? i.e. look for the default template if one is not found.

Great help from all of you. Thank you so much for the time and help!

At my job we're developing websites for grocery stores that have some basic pages (about us, e-mail subscriptions, departments, employment pages, circulars/ads, store locators, and recipes).

I have been able to knock out every minus the recipes and the advertisements. One thing that I've been assigned to do is to simulate a shopping cart but not in it's traditional way. I'm supposed to be able to click on an image (or pdf), and then have the option of adding said item to a ""shopping list"" which is ultimately going to be printable. I have no idea how to go about doing this, because each store ad page is going to be arranged differently. Any thoughts?

Another outstanding thing is the subscription page. Users are to be able to visit the website and register for the website. Based on their registration information, I can customize the display that they get by assigning all the generic information to their specific location. To kind-of get a head start on this, I've created a reference entity for a content type of ""store location"". Based on this, I can assign a store to a customer and was hoping to combine this with profile2 to sort-of facilitate this process.

I should note that this is my first official project in D7, so I'm excited! I've done some minor drupal work in the past (http://digital.fisherprintingwebsites.com/), so I'm not too much of a newbie at Drupal. :)

We have our main website (website.com) and three large subsites (subsite1.website.com, subsite2.website.com, subsite3.website.com). Each of these subsites have different organizations that have their own websites (subsite1.website.com/org1, subsite1.website.com/org2, etc.). Some content like news articles and events are shared across the sites. All other content is pertinent to only the specific group.

We need to restrict users to their own groups. Members in subsite1.website.com/org1 should for the most part only have permissions for org1 stuff and not org2 or subsite2 stuff. In a previous question, I was told Organic Groups is good for this.  
Also, we need to be able to have similar directory or file names. For example there will be a subsite1.website.com/about-us and a subsite2.website.com/about-us. I heard this is a problem with domain access. 

Currently, we have a multisite set up (correct terminology?), where there is one Drupal install and each subsite (subsite1.website.com, subsite2.website.com, subsite3. website.com) has its own database. The problem Iâm seeing in the future is how will we be able to link news and events between the sites? 

Iâve heard of a single install and breaking subsites up using domain access, but will that create a long list of nodes and content types for users to dig through?

Is there a better way to do this? Iâve been looking into Features, Taxonomies, Domain Access, and a bunch of other things, but I am really confused about which structure would be best. Are there any questions Iâm not answering?

Does anybody have some solid resource or advice about how to go about things?

I've checked drupal.org and Google (and /r/drupal) to see if I can find anything helpful, but to no avail. 

Views/Panels/etc seem to be popular answers (especially for customizing the content type entry form), but the Views module isn't getting me where I want to be.

I've been going the node--*contenttype*.tpl.php route, and have deferred items (i.e. hide($content['field_xyz']);) to later be able to render() them where I want them... 

The problem is, I just get a pile of DIVs layout (rows for taxonomy terms, and a list of images for the field_image field I'm using) which I was hoping to channel into a list based (UL) representation.

I know once I get the hang of this Drupal looks a lot more like chocolate and peanut butter...

I was thinking with Organic Groups I could have each owner have their own group. Their news, trading block, etc would all be editable only by the team.

Groups could be given weight to determine standings.

Players would be handled like content. Team X would purpose that content 1 and 2 would be placed in Team Y's area and in return Team X would receive content 3. The admin would then approve the swap.

A waiver system would be designed so a piece of content is made public, Team G, Q, B, and O can post a claim (via comments?) within 48 hours of the initial post. A PHP evaluation takes place and that content is awarded to a team based on their current standing.

And a few other things, but those are a few examples.

When I have worked with other packages and I get in this situation, I come up with a simple project, attempt to implement it, and go from there.  9 times out of 10 I can do this without reaching out and asking for help; I guess Drupal gets to be that 1 time...

First off, let me describe my project.  It is very basic.

1. A list of clients (not Drupal users) containing their First Name, Last Name, and Company Name.
2. Phone fields for each client.  The phone list would contain the area code, phone number, extension, and a type (e.g. home, work, fax, etc.) for the number.
3. A view that displays a list of clients (bonus if there was a way to associate one number with each client as the 'preferred' number and could display it here).
4. A view that displays a client and all numbers associated with it.

I'm pretty sure I could just create a content type that had the client fields, but how do I associate numbers with clients?  How do I allow an arbitrary number of numbers per client?  If this were SQL I'd have two tables, client and phone, and phone would have the foreign key of the client.  How do I delete phone numbers when I client is deleted?

I'm very sorry for the basic nature of this question, I just have no idea where to even start getting at this.  Thanks!

I should preface this with ""I have no experience with Drupal""  :)

Looking for some advice here. I've been asked to resolve some issues with a business' Drupal installation. The person who did the initial setup had left the user registration page open. It looks like some bot was autocreating accounts and creating content with malicious links mixed among random placeholder text pointing to websites (""buy discount flip flops here!"" etc.). There were about 6500 extra accounts that had been made, and an additional 3,000 pages with content like this. 

Anyway, I cleaned that stuff up, disabled the user registration and reset the site passwords. There is one left over bit of fun and it seems that the person responsible had injected a link in the header of the page just above the logo that seems to be only visible in Chrome. See [here.](http://i.imgur.com/IQgjCip.png). The corresponding HTML code for this section is [here.](http://i.imgur.com/oc0Plz0.png).

It doesn't seem like you can customize much in the Manage File Display tab of the field type.

I've used the example code on [this page](http://groups.drupal.org/node/22888) to add a ""+"" button to each day on my calendar, and clicking on the + will open the ""add a new event"" page, however it doesn't prepopulate the date field.

Here's my code for that form_alter() function (inside a custom module called caladd):

    function caladd_form_alter(&amp;$form, $form_state, $form_id) {
    if ($form_id == 'event_node_form' &amp;&amp; arg(3) != '') {
         $form['field_event_date'][0]['#default_value']['value'] = arg(3) . ' 12:00:00';
         $form['field_event_date'][0]['#default_value']['value2'] = arg(3) . ' 13:00:00';

and the HTML code for the field is:

    &lt;input id=""edit-field-event-date-0-value-datepicker-popup-0"" class=""form-text"" type=""text"" value="""" size=""20"" name=""field_event_date[0][value][date]"" maxlength=""30""&gt;&lt;/input&gt;

When I add this, the entire &lt;fieldset&gt; containing this entire section disappears.

So, the name of the field is `field_event_date[0][value][date]`. If I change the php code to say anything other than `event_date`, the section reappears,  and the field is blank. So I guess that's correct. I've tried rearranging the `['#default_value']` and adding in a `['date']` field, but I really don't know what I'm doing. 

I feel I'm really close though, I'm just messing up something very basic with the syntax. Can anyone help me?"	t5_2qhl5	True
1358763407.0	16zdyu	A couple of questions about Drupal, from a novice...	Enherjer	6	0	10	"Hi r/Drupal.

I've been commissioned by my boss to figure out if Drupal would be a fitting CMS to run the site of our organisation (http://www.spaedbarnsdoed.dk/) and I thought I'd hear some opinions from this fine subreddit.

Right now, the site's backend is TYPO3 (http://typo3.org/), which I find rather weird to work in, and looks horribly unintuitive, so we're contemplating a change. 

My personal experience with Drupal is somewhat limited, so I have a few questions regarding the old Typo3 site vs. a new Drupal site:

1. From a technical standpoint, how dificult is it to take the current design of the webpage and mirror it on a Drupal site, with some eventual minor changes?

2. Is Drupal a good fit for this type of site (mostly written content, a few pictures, possibly some videos in the future)?

3. The guys who created the current site in Typo3, also made a webshop. Thing is, the webshop has never really worked. How is Drupal at controlling webshops?

4. How long would you say it takes to learn how to add/edit content on a website with Drupal? My co-workers would have to learn how to do some of this, and if it's difficult to get the hang of, we'd probably have to look at another CMS.


Just for clarification, I won't be coding the thing myself. Also, the amount of visitors on the site isn't very heavy.

So, the site is still currently on Dreamhost, but I have a 1024mb Linode and I'm playing around with it a bit every day. Migrating is taking longer than I thought it would because I don't have a lot of time to mess with it and because I have a LOT to learn. So far, however, I love everything about Linode. I most especially love the Linode Library.

I signed up for a New Relic account, and after much trouble got it working on the Dreamhost site (not like there is much to monitor on the Linode at the moment). It looks very cool, but I have no idea how to interpret the information it's throwing at me or how to find most of the information that is promised. At first glance, it's very daunting. Any help in wading through it (or a link to the relevant docs) would be appreciated.

We moved the radio show to Live365 which, change in workflow aside, seems to be pretty awesome. It took a lot of load off the Dreamhost server this morning, though the server did still end up running out of memory and rebooting after the show.

One big question on my mind is how we are going to handle the archives of the radio show on Linode. Up to now, we have been generating a 100MB+ mp3 every weekday and uploading the week's worth in a batch on weekends. That's half a gig per week. This was no issue at Dreamhost as they offer ""unlimited"" storage. Linode, however, limits us to 40GB, which we will outgrow eventually. The Live365 files ought to be smaller, as they are recorded at a much lower bit rate (but with better sound quality), but there are photos and music and all kinds of stuff going up all the time.

My first thought was to move all of the media hosting to S3 or Cloudfront or something like that, but I haven't found a way to integrate those into Dreamhost such that the remote storage is treated just like local storage. How do you guys solve this problem?

If there is still interest, I'll post again when I have things running exclusively on Linode."	t5_2qhl5	True

1341416369.0	w197v	[Help] Any experts on implementing AJAX-style auto-complete in Drupal 7?	psychosid	6	1	11	"I have a client who wants his site to be able to handle PDF file uploads along with a set of custom fields to be able to categorize and search for various fields later. But his staff will be doing the data entry for hundreds of files, and wants them to be able to just ""select"" the proper choice, based on the choices made in fields above.

For example, one of the first fields will be ""State"", and we can obviously populate that list without AJAX, just giving the user a drop-down box to select state. But then, based on that state, can we present the next field based on that choice. For example, in Texas, land is categorized by Survey Number and Abstract. But in Louisiana, it's by Township and Parish. So, if the user chooses TX, can I have the field names for Survey Number and Abstract become active, and then use an AJAX-style autocomplete with the available choices for Texas Survey No.?

Please help"	syzgyn	7	0	8	"**Setup:**

* Both sites are on a single VPS, each with it's own domain and account.  They're on separate databases, except for the users table which is on a third database and shared between the two.  Each site doesn't have DB access to the other site's DB.

* APC and Memcache are installed and running on the VPN for both sites jointly.


**Issue:**

* At any given time right now, one of the sites will be working fine.  The other site seems to take all it's menu and module settings directly from the working site's cache or db.  The broken site's content is still correct, but that's about it.

* At seemingly random times, the sites will switch which one is working and which one is broken and pulling from the working one.

* On the broken site, the primary menu will show any menu items that have the same title on both sites, and none that are unique to that site.  All the menu links are incorrect though.

* The menu issue only appears to happen on some pages.

* When I try to change a setting on the broken site, it updates the other site's database.

**Things I've tried/checked:**

* The databases themselves are correct for each site.  They just seem to be pulling from the wrong one half the time.

* APC is only caching one of the sites right now, it doesn't seem to make any difference as to which site works or doesn't.


My guess at this point is some weird caching issue where both sites pull up the same settings.php, which then connects to the wrong database.  This would explain the database issue.  I have literally no idea how to go about confirming and fixing it though.

I wil start a new project in a short while. Now I'm wondering which basetheme to use.

* Be responsive or at least a bit complaint so i can make tweaks afterwards.
* Lightweight.
* Maybe easy to share by a team, useable over more projects ( a basetheme ; ).

The last theme I used was Omega. This was in november. I really liked it and used it with delta and context.
I came across some issues:

* A week or two after startup my project manager decided we did not want to make the website responsive. It would be to hard for the designers and become to costly. This made me feel like we used a to big theme for a normal website.
* The base design by the designers did not exactly fit the 960 grid. Due to my ignorance this made me abuse the grid system.

I'm using Drupal because I'm pretty comfortable with it and I know it is powerful enough to do what I want, if I can just figure out how to do it.

What I want to do is first create a site that simply allows anyone to browse for and upload an image straight from the home page, logged in or not. Just Hit browse and submit. This brings up some questions for me though:

1. My first instinct is to make each image or batch of images their own node so they can potentially be commented on and have them show up in that user's gallery if the person happens to be logged in. However, creating a new content type requires the Title and Body fields, is there a way to make those optional? Is there a good module that does this type of thing already?

2. Is there any way to randomize uploaded file names like most sites (such as imgur) do so there is no potential name conflicts or issues?

It quickly became troublesome to not only keep track of all the Drupal websites we ran but also to keep them up to date. To help solve this problem I created [Module Watch](http://www.modulewatch.com) and have been using it internally in our company for the past few months.

To use it sign up for an account using the code 'reddit' without the quotes. Once registered, head to your home page and you will find your api key and instructions on where to download the companion module. Install the companion module on your site, enter your api key, and then tell the module to submit your site to Module Watch. Now when you go to the updates tab on Module Watch you will see all the updates available for your site and be able to download them all with a click of a button.

But I have noticed some big changes in the way things operate with Views which I can't seem to understand. Normally I like to just use template files to control a lot of the themeing for views, but I can't seem to access all of the data I used to be able to. 

Normally I like working in the *views-view-field.tpl.php* file and styling from there. But now if I
    dsm($fields);
I don't see all the data that I used to. Instead of having access to the raw data, all I see is the number 1, and rather than the array being indexed by field name, it uses entity_id, which seems a little bit confusing. I know I can style the fields using the individual field templates, but I liked having access to all of the view's data, not just the rendered output. Am I missing something here?

I have to build a forum. It is an add-on to an existing D6 site. I'm not a fan of Drupal's forum module. I think software designed specifically to be a forum tends to do a much better job at it. A good bridge for a decent php forum feels to me like a better solution than building a quirky forum in Drupal, especially considering that even Drupal.org's own forums are painfully slow and feature poor.

So what are your thoughts? Are there some modules and techniques to building a forum in Drupal that significantly improve the user experience and performance? What are the common features users expect of a message board? Can Drupal provide these services in a manner that is easy and intuitive for site users? Simply being possible isn't enough -- it also has to be reasonably economical. Can this feature set be implemented well within a time frame that is remotely competitive with setting up PhpBB, vBulletin, or the likes? Is there a good Drupal bridge to some decent forum software? Is a native forum.module forum worth the Drupal overhead incurred when many users login simultaneously? "	t5_2qhl5	True

To give some more directed information than what is in the description, we are looking for someone with very solid PHP skills and Drupal experience as well, especially in the areas of theme and module development. We also do a fair amount of custom development, mostly for staff automation purposes, but we also assist our Faculty Resource Center in developing educational applications for students. Our standard framework for custom development is CakePHP, though any framework experience would be great. Frontend experience in HTML/CSS/JS is also required, with jQuery experience being preferred. 

We are a LAMP/SVN/Eclipse(Aptana)/ActiveCollab shop in terms of development environment.

We are heavy believers in open source technology and open APIs.

The university is currently undergoing a massive overhaul of both our external and internal sites. You would play a key part in helping us finish this initiative and move forward towards the development of an integrated service platform, including mobile web based applications.

I am using Drupal 7 as webservice (using Services) for mobile app. It's great how fast it can be done with Drupal since there are so much things already done!

Currently project is in alpha stage, but soon I will need to do some beta testing, and if everything is OK - make release(s)

I wonder could I do development in some kind ""Debian"" way, if I may say so :) :

* Have 'Unstable"" drupal site in alpha.myhost.com, do all development there. It would have lot's of generated ""junk"" content for various testing.
* Prepare and regularly sync ""Testing"" site in beta.myhost.com for closed/open beta. It would be updated, let's say, weekly on some new kinda-stable features made in ""alpha"" site, it would help to test module/node/theme upgrades before releasing to wild public.
* ""Stable"", production site in myhost.com which would be merged from beta one after beta.myhost.com is stable enough...

Could this scheme be reasonable enough? I am using Features module to make website more strictly.. ""defined"", but I am not sure if this would suffice for custom content types and other delicate changes...

How could I sync (diff?) alpha/beta/release websites with changing content types, possibly custom entities, taxonomy terms (which are pretty strict/hardcoded!) more easily and in more robust way? How should I make changes and not to forget to apply them in production site?

I would like to use my client's new website to build myself a solid single page theme similar to the navigation of a site like this:

http://www.sweez.com.br/#inicio

My initial plan was to build a theme and maybe an accompanying module, if necessary, to be used to contain the core functionality so I can reuse it easily for future sites.  I planned on possibly separating all the design customization specific to his site into a child theme, and doing the same for future sites utilizing the theme.  


What I have so far:

1.  Drupal and many important modules including drupal commerce installed via drush

2.  Initialized a theme utilizing Matt Bank's Drupal 7 Starter Theme: http://goo.gl/tRkfd

3.  Compass for sass and Grunt for task optimizations

4.  Experience building a similar site, but not tied into a Drupal.



Here are my questions:

1.  I've looked around, but can anyone recommend a theme built like this to base mine off of as I build it?  I still planned on making this one custom, but it's always good to have something to look to for help.

2.  What is the best way to go about the sections of the single page site?  A custom content type that I loop through on the main page?  Each section will just have a name, and content.  

3.  What is the best way to generate the items in the nav bar since they wont be ""Drupal Pages"" the way most themes display them?  If I went the route of a custom content type, I would just write a loop through the titles of those instead.  


Once those main sections are displayed and working, I plan on adding a blog and  store section.  These would be relatively separate from the rest of the site since they don't really need any parallax or single page loading.

Ok, so I had my little D7 site running dandy on localhost (Acquia DAMP) and tries to clone the Bartik theme for further fiddling.

I copied the whole Bartik tree into sites/all/themes and edited the relevant files to match the new name for the theme (folder also renamed accordingly).

I log off for the day and now I logged in, main page loads, I got to admin/themes and BOOM error message, memory exhausted etc so I go into the PHP config and give it more, restart the stack, no luck.

The message:

Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 536870912 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 35 bytes) in E:\&lt;path&gt;\includes\theme.inc on line 98

(note: it remains at 35 bytes with 256M, 384M or now at 512M bytes set for PHP)

The relevant line of the theme.inc file:

     // Find all our ancestor themes and put them in an array.
      $base_theme = array();
      $ancestor = $theme;
      while ($ancestor &amp;&amp; isset($themes[$ancestor]-&gt;base_theme)) {

        $base_theme[] = $themes[$ancestor];

I tried moving the whole directory tree of the attempted theme clone to an unrelated location (outside of the DAMP path) and still no luck.

One shortcoming is that people want to see the quality before they buy so we have added a [free sample request form](https://kissprinting.com/request-sample).   What I would like to do is one of the following, with a slight preference to the first option.

1. Instead of a webform to request the sample I would like it to be a product that they can purchase for no charge.  Creating the product is easy enough, and I think I can figure out the rules to not apply shipping to it, but I can't seem to figure out how to bypass requiring a credit card.  I do not want them to have to enter a credit card to request the free sample.

2. Continue to use the webform, but after the form submission by an anonymous user automatically create an account for them similar to the way commerce does for an anonymous checkouts. I don't see with rules how to do this with webform data.

&gt;Well, it's a mixture of Social Networking and File Sharing. Hopefully we can implement encryption to prevent illegal shit.

&gt;Dropbox is a great service, but it's shared folder is functional but bland.

&gt;Users or Networks create ""Hubs"", where users can subscribe to their content and download as they please.

I have been looking at a couple CMS's - Drupal and Joomla. Obviously, this subreddit will be biased, but stay with me on this. I'm looking for the best CMS for me and my uses. 

I have a few different needs. First, the site needs to look professional. One can achieve this with any CMS out there, so this isn't an issue.

Mind you, I have no experience with either CMS, so I'd need resources to essentially spell it out for me. I have some HTML, PHP, and CSS experience, as well as dealing with the Yii framework (albeit not efficiently).

A friend of mine asked how hard it'd be to make a price aggregator and I had a bit of a brainstorm. He put of the hypothesis that the stores would, themselves, submit the information and prices in exchange for the free advertisement.

Here is what I came up with:

* Feeds to handle a xml, csv, whatever dump. Up to them to set it up right.
* Profile2 to handle retailers and normal users
* Views with aggregation for showing lowest price

My problem, however, is how to handle the actual products being added. At first I thought of doing an automated title (just for record keeping, won't be shown anywhere), a taxonomy that is the EAN number (to combine for the same model as I doubt every store have the same model number), price, stock and direct link. 

I just tried to make a views such as this but had major difficulties since I'd require a sort of category as well. Adding another taxonomy to the taxonomy itself doesn't work for views and adding another category to the node itself would mean it is even harder to simply make a feed to import new prices. Just doing EAN number in a second level with the Category on top (Drink -&gt; EAN number for example), made it hard to make a view that differentiated from the top level to the second level (or at least to the extend of my Google-fu). So I can't help but feel that I am making this harder than it should be.

I have trouble knowing where to even begin troubleshooting. I'm on Drupal 7. It looks like this may be a view? We are a news site and use the built-in view for 10 articles at a time. So, it looks like maybe that's the view (limit 10 articles, offset 80 so page 9, sorted descending).

I don't use any outside caching because when I tried to, my users were seeing stale content. I probably just need to fine-tune it, but I haven't gotten the budget approval to do that.

I do, however, use Drupal's built-in caching and also turned on time-based caching in all my views."	t5_2qhl5	True
