1345755896.0	ypszb	Hey animators - Would anyone be interested in a 101 course over on UReddit?	Monster_Chomp	215	23	103	"Hey all, so I've been warming up to the existence of University of Reddit (I know others have joked about its necessity; I personally think it looks like great place for others to teach trades and skills), and was wondering if anyone would be interested in a 101/Intro course to 2D animation?  There's a nice crop of digital/Maya/CG stuff right now so I thought there'd be some benefit to a fundamentals course.  I originally asked in [this thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/yj64t/request_animation/), but thought I might get more opinions in the actual animation subreddit.

I have 6 years professional working experience, am based in drawn animation, but am very technically adept (so I'd be covering a wide variety of approaches and mediums).  Teaching actual classes IRL would be an awesome thing to do in the future for me, but right now the only way I can scratch that itch is to give it a try online.  I'd like to start early September, but need to garner enough interest beforehand and so I can get started generating material.  Any takers?

Side note: apologies for the new-ish looking name and lack of posts; I'm actually on here more often but wanted a lone account for teachin'.

**EDIT:**Holy cow, I hopped on to reply to any hopeful commenters and now have a heap to go through!  Needless to say this is plenty enough for me to go and start the course.  I was hoping for, at minimum, 6 or 7, so this is awesome.  I'll be putting up an interest check in the UofR subreddit just to cover my bases anyway, and put in the course application.

Also yes: free (always), possibly subreddit but I am going to see if I can even make a YouTube channel/livestream for this, and this course will be more about drawing and motion fundamentals - not necessarily software/tech (though I'll be doing a tech overview for the first day so I can make sure as many of you can have access to participating as possible, not everyone has flash or access to scanners, etc and want to be able to offer different avenues of compositing your work, etc).

**EDIT2:** Bit of delay (past week had me running around busy), but I dropped an interest check over at [r/UniversityofReddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/yz35h/interest_check_animation_101fundamentals/) and will be submitting an actual course soon!  I'm projecting to start on the 3rd of September and hold this every Monday.  Live attendance wouldn't be required but I'll have a scheduled course material posting so everyone can keep track easier.

Through the exposure given by these animations, I've acquired several freelance gigs, and have thus never had to work a job outside my room.

I'm getting ready to launch a Kickstarter campaign to fund the making of number 4, because, due to the scope of the project, I can't afford to work hundreds of unpaid hours to simply please the fans.

His mistake early in his career was in having a reel that was too broad. You need to be able to say you have one thing you excel at.

Be careful what work you do for free. Don't get led through the mud.

Be wary of producers. Each and every one of them.

Each and every single job he has gotten has been because of a relationship. Cultivate friendships, genuine ones, with your colleagues and employers as much as possible.

Study film theory. Study FILMS.

YOU ARE NOT PUSHING YOUR ANIMATION ENOUGH

In interviews, they really just want to know they can work with you. Your reel and resume check out. Now they want to see if you are a good fit for their environment. If they are critiquing your reel in front of you and saying critical things, it is because they want to know how well you take direction. If you are defensive and snobby about your work, they assume you will be a pain in the ass to direct.

All writing is rewriting. And murder your darlings. If it doesn't work, scrap it.

Certain things take a long time. Getting your first job. Working up to working on features. Landing and agent. Getting and option deal. It just takes time. Keep plugging away!

Some of you might remember me from such threads as [What I have Learned From Being The Wife of an Animator/Director/Screenwriter for Many Years and who has Worked on Stuff you Have Seen](http://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/yhty9/what_i_have_learned_from_being_the_wife_of_an/), [Regarding Specialization In Animation](http://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/yjgk7/regarding_specialization_in_animation/), as well as ""Let's Save Tony Orlando's House!""

Thought I'd pass on the recent PM I had with an animator.  The responses are written by me, but the idea's are Dan's and I consulted him on this.

*I know this is a bit of a late reply but what does your husband focus on when hiring someone? Also how big of a factor is knowledge of the specific program being used? Give the example of knowing blender or 3dsmax and having to learn maya?*

**Hi!**

**When he's hiring, he pretty much looks for two things.**

**First, a kick ass reel. It should be short, punchy and show that you can tell a story/get the flow of a scene. Don't be long. Don't try to be broad. Be good at one thing and flaunt it.  Always start with your best shots.**

**Second, are you personable and can you fit into the studio culture. Do they wanna be around you 8+ hours a day? Just be fricking frienly and genuine. Relating to this, he will often play a person's reel during and interview and critique it. Not criticize or be mean, but say, ""You could have pushed it more in that last shot."" If you get all huffy and defensive, he assumes you will be a pain in the ass to direct, and rightly so.**

**Those are the two big things. I remember once he was hiring for a position and interviewed two equally qualified candidates in one day. Reels and experience of equal caliber. The one dude was all huffy and brisk in the interview. The other dude took critique well and seemed friendly. When the friendly dude walked out of the studio into the hall they heard him say to himself, ""I WANNA WORK HERE!!!""**

**Guess who he hired?**

**You should know Maya well. Maya is standard. There has only been one gig where he worked in another program and that was when he was directing a 2D show and they used ToonBoom, which he picked up really quickly. Just be competent in Maya. One day, you may be at Pixar where they use their own proprietary software, but don't cross that bridge until you come to it. ;)**

Hope this helps."	t5_2qlmp	True

Basically, it's a site where you can create simple flipbook-style animations. Something between a rage comic and Simon's Cat.

I'm at the point now where I want to figure out if I should keep working on it, or move on to something else. I'd love any kind of feedback you guys have. Is there anything particularly annoying about it? Anything awesome? How can I make it better?

TL;DR: I made [thumbcinema](http://thumbcine.ma). Should I hang my head in shame or find the nearest person to high-five?

**EDIT:** Wow, thanks everyone! I wasn't expecting this much of a positive reaction! There's heaps of good ideas/feedback in here, so it looks like I'm going to stick with thumbcinema for a while and work to improve it. Keep it coming! :D

**EDIT 2:** FYI, there are a few horrible bugs I want to fix as quickly as I can:

* ~~Chrome isn't actually sad. Some people are getting a weird false-positive on the feature-detection.~~
* ~~Some hiccups when creating an account during the save process. If this happened to you, don't worry, your flipbook was saved, but unpublished. I'm manually publishing them under user ""anon"" for now. If you see your flipbook under this account, let me know and I'll update it to be yours.~~ 
* ~~Penises. I have been humbled by the internet. I didn't realise I was so naive, but I didn't see this coming. So I guess I am. I don't plan on blocking adult content, but I want to include a voluntary+community NSFW tag so that at least the front-page is child/work friendly.~~

Hopefully I can knock this all out by the end of the week, because I'm off on holidays for two weeks after that. Once I'm back I want to get stuck in and build some more features based on some of the things suggested. I don't want to spam /r/web_design or /r/animation, so if you'd like to follow the development/report bugs/suggest features/share flipbooks, I've created /r/thumbcinema and [thumbcine_ma](http://twitter.com/thumbcine_ma) and hello@thumbcine.ma

(first post lol)		76	18	19	"I'm going to be both completely honest and fair regarding the quality of this subreddit--this has everything to do with those ""first time animating"" posts. And this is something I've been itching to talk about for the past year.

Right now, the top link for the past week is a screenshot of a Southpark episode showing probably one animator's mistake. It's funny, true, but that's the *highest upvoted link* in the entire past week. Among the highest voted links in all of animation, ever, are these ""first time"" and ""check out what i made"" posts that are neither indications of quality nor effort.

I've seen about a million ""this is my first time"" posts, and that seems to be the trigger sentence to instantly boost someone's shitty half-second, poorly made animation to the very top. It's almost become a parody of itself. And on the flip side, I've also seen people who have put maybe an entire year of their life into an animated short film, and getting a meager three or four upvotes.

But I'm not here to say ""upvote *this* not *that*""; rather, **I implore those submitting to consider the quality of their work, how they present it, and their reasons for it.**

It's a sad day when a kid posts his ""first animation ever"" gets a lot more publicity than a student (*or even a professional*) who has studied for years with passion, effort, sweat, and tears.

I know that animation takes time. I know that it's hard. Hell, I'm studying it right now. All the time. It takes devotion, effort, your firstborn son...everything. And I know it's *especially* important to be encouraging towards newcomers. But there are times where that encouragement is rendered utterly useless, and all it does is draw useless attention to someone's poor attempt at learning an art form.

Consider this: do you want a subreddit devoted to the ""art of animation"" to consist solely of terrible flash animated ""first time"" posts and screenshots of sausage clippings? I guess so, because that's all this place really is now.

(note: for those who want to start learning animation, there's a huge collection of resources in the sidebar...[this link](http://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/f7yrf/if_you_started_a_theoretical_animation_store/) provides a bunch of books and resources for you to start from. of course, this is a lot more closely related to character animation, but every animation purist will tell you that character animation is the heart and soul of *every* type of animation. for those who want to start studying special effects animation, i recommend checking out the two volumes of joseph gilland's [elemental magic books](http://elementalmagic.blogspot.com/). and if you're looking for more feedback or help... there's an actual subreddit community for animators to post their work and get critique. it needs more people and attention! you can find it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/framebyframe).)"	t5_2qlmp	True

1332627929.0	rbxc8	Yesterday a video was deleted from YouTube: The Sweatbox, an animation documentary that Disney has successfully suppressed for 10 years. Here's how you can see it.	WhitherUganda	53	6	43	"[The Sweatbox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sweatbox#The_Sweatbox) reveals the drama that went on during the creation of ""The Emperor's New Groove"". To give you an idea of how rare it is, it was only screened twice at film festivals in 2002. Disney then forbade its release and ordered copies of it destroyed. It's so hard to get a hold of that a Disney representative had to accompany a copy at all times during a rare screening at Pixar:

&gt; It seems that -- in mid-2002 -- the folks at Pixar Animation Studio wanted to hold a screening of ""The Sweatbox"" for all of the employees working at their Emeryville, CA. studio. So -- after a little negotiation -- Disney agreed to send a copy of the film up to Pixar ... provided that the print was always accompanied by a Disney studio representative.

&gt; And when I say ""always,"" I mean ""ALWAYS."" The story that I hear is that ""Monsters, Inc."" director Peter Docter actually offered to take the print's guardian down to Cafe Luxo for a quick bite to eat. The Disney studio representative refused, allegedly saying: ""If I ever let this copy of 'The Sweatbox' out of my sight, it could wind up costing me my job.""

So you can see how shocking it is that, two days ago, a 480p version was uploaded to YouTube. It far surpasses the quality of the previous bootlegged version, and is a direct transfer from a ~~~master VHS~~~BetaCam SX  tape (probably). It lasted two days and got 30,000 views before it was removed.

Re-uploading it to YouTube isn't an option, and with seizures of domains like MegaUpload, rampant anti-piracy measures at HotFile, RapidShare, etc., it'd only be a matter of time before it will be removed there. Fortunately, there's still a way for you to see it.

1. Download and install [I2P](http://www.i2p2.de/). I2P is an anonymous network. It lets you browse a darknet and share information without corporations like Disney dictating what you can and can't see.

2. Once I2P is running, open ""I2P Snark,"" which is a BitTorrent client. You can do so by clicking ""Torrents.""

3. Paste the following magnet URL into the ""From URL"" box under ""Add Torrent.""  This will indicate to the network that you want to download *The Sweatbox*:

    magnet:?xt=urn:btih:97a76d8e0acb341cbb8811e50a367b197fa9a8f7&amp;tr=http://tracker2.postman.i2p/announce.php

[screenshot](http://s18.postimage.org/khfmhustz/tmpscreenshot.jpg)

(If for some reason this doesn't work, you can click ""Postman"" to access that I2P BitTorrent tracker. Search for ""The Sweatbox"" there, or check the recent torrents.

4. Click ""Add torrent"" and wait. The page will refresh and indicate when the file starts downloading. 

I2P will be much slower than the regular Internet as your traffic has to bounce around peers in order to make it anonymous. You can help make the file faster for others by seeding it. Just let your computer and I2P run even after the file has downloaded. 

There are other ways to share files, such as The Piratebay and private BitTorrent trackers. These aren't anonymous, and private trackers don't allow just anybody to share information. You have to belong to a special club. 

The value of this documentary is so high, however, and the content so compelling, that hopefully you won't mind learning how to use a new, cutting edge, open, and truly anonymous technology. One day you too might depend on the anonymity that I2P provides.

*edit*

***TL;DR/why should I care?***

**Synopsis -- or, why it's totally kick-ass that this documentary suddenly surfaced two days ago:**

Similar to ""Waking Sleeping Beauty"", ""The Sweatbox"" offers a titillating glimpse into what it's like to work at an animation studio. Traditionally Disney has tried to present the appearance that their movies are created in a very flowing, gentile manner (in keeping of the spirit of the ""old men"" of animation, and Disney himself), and have suppressed information to the contrary. This documentary really paved the way to dispelling that smokescreen.

Basically if you like film making, animation, or wonder what it's like to work on a project where hundreds of people are literally pouring their hearts and souls into a project that (should something go wrong) could crash and burn tomorrow, you'll probably enjoy it. The film starts out with an animator whispering that the producers hated the first version, and they're all upstairs in a story room discussing six different pitches for the future of the movie. He admits that they might actually decide to kill the movie outright (which isn't unprecedented in animation studios), which would mean, literally, that hundreds of people would lose their jobs just like that. These are artists who pore their heart and soul into their work, and it shows. At some point they (accurately) talk about how getting a character cut from the script is very similar to the feeling of losing a part of your life. Something you've literally spent years creating suddenly being worthless and lost, as if it died

You also get to see plenty of pencil tests, storyboards, interviews with the creators, and brainstorming meetings. Including one where they basically call in the most respected names in animation to try and brainstorm a way to save ""The Kingdom of the Sun"", the then-name for ""The Emperor's New Groove"".

It also has an aura of mystery around it, because it's basically shocking that THIS movie, which has been so rare and hard to obtain, suddenly surfaced in excellent quality! It's satisfying that, after ten years of Disney suppressing the film to the point of requiring its representatives to literally not let it out of their sight, it suddenly surfaces.

For those interested in the course I will talk about basic flash animation techniques, how to use the flash tools properly, and if all goes well I might even go into advance flash techniques and any other topics people have in mind. This course will hopefully give a good boost to anyone planning on getting into the animation industry.

And, fun fact, He's the real-life person that Mr. Magoo was based on.
He was also a teacher of animation at CalArts and taught some of the industry's most famous animators such as Henry Selick (Coraline), Stephen Hillenburg (Spongebob Squarepants), Peter Chung (Aeon Flux), and Glen Keane who was the lead animator for Ariel, Alladin, Beast, Pocahontas, Professor Ratigan, and Tarzan (dude's a fuckin' machine).
It's very important, not just to the memory of Engel, but to our entire craft, that you support this documentary and all others like it. Animation, as an art form has been swept under the rug by supposed ""high-art"" historians and as such we just don't have as deep a well of history to pull from as say, a painter would. When cannot let our heritage vanish. Getting this documentary made will help show today's animators WHY cartoons have become what they are today, and give them a firm historical reference point that will hopefully keep the stagnation of our art form to a minimum.

I'm not trying to supersede individual postings of animated shorts nor is this some sort of subtle commentary against re-posts, I just wanted to share my running list of animations I think are really good and organize them for you. There are quite a few gems in here, many of which you may have already seen (probably posted here many, many times too be sure) but there are most likely many, many more you have not seen or have missed. Hopefully this will make a handy cheat-sheet for you or will at least help you pass some of that inevitable holiday boredom time (each short is between 1 min and 30 min long and would take over 30 hours to watch them all in one sitting). Also, some animations are not for kids so assume everything here is **NSFW**.

I've orginized the list as follows : 

* In the comments below, each animation is sorted by year/decade/era (as accurately as I could research) since that seemed the easiest way to filter out such an enormous list. Under each year the films are organized alphabetically by the animator/director/studio (though some of that information may be missing, incorrect, incomplete or even spelled wrong). Since comments tend to be liquid, here is a quick jump-to-guide for each category :

* I've included my personal annotations for *nearly* every animation. These are just simple thoughts and rough notes I wrote after (and sometimes during) watching each short for the first time (or having watched it again after many years). Hopefully the notes will be helpful (though some probably won't be). I decided to include them since most give a decent enough description to help you determine if you've seen something before or to help you decide which ones you might want to watch. 

* All the links are (were) working as of Sunday, December 19th, 2010 at 8:00am Colorado, US time. Some links may not be available outside of the US (sorry about that), however if you can provide a secondary link please do so. I also really did try to find links that go directly to the original artist's site/blog/YouTube/Vimeo/producers page but more often than not I wasn't able to find it (or I got lazy, too be honest), so if you know a better link please tell me and I will fix it (and any other errors you find) immediately. 

This list is by no means 100% comprehensive as there are thousands more films online - this is only my personal ""all the best of"" I've collected over the years and it mostly just represents 1 or 2 films per animator (though some Russian animators are quite well represented since they are my favorite). There are also hardly any music videos on this list since I'm not too knowledgeable about them. I know there are some amazing animated music videos ([Tool](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hglVqACd1C8), [Radiohead](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHiGbolFFGw), [Bjork](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjAoBKagWQA), [A-Ha](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EXxMlIExpo), [Blockhead](http://vimeo.com/12622016), [Pearl Jam](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C9CH3q9PLI), [Peter Gabriel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqyc37aOqT0), [The White Stripes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q27BfBkRHbs), [Röyksopp](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhl8frFh3NQ), [Daft Punk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGBhQbmPwH8), [Animusic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyCIpKAIFyo) and [Dire Straits](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACGUasFWVsI)) - maybe someone should post that list as the [one on Wikipeadia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Animated_music_videos) was deleted.

Oh, and in case you are wondering why this is crossposted; well r/animation does not get much traffic but it is the proper sub for this sort of thing, however, most animation usually gets posted in r/videos since that's where the majority of reddit is more likely to see it.

http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/uglq4/easily_the_most_fucked_up_scene_in_spongebob/

http://i.imgur.com/dl29F.gif

&gt;It's probably too late to comment, but this was drawn by my friend Robertryan Cory. I showed him that he had made the front page of Reddit:

http://i.imgur.com/9hQJ9.png

http://i.imgur.com/M1QhY.png

&gt;His aforementioned character designs/roughs gallery:

http://www.flickr.com/photos/robertryancory/sets/72157619658736293/

&gt;People keep saying ""Ren &amp; Stimpy, Ren &amp; Stimpy,"" and Robert did work on that show as well as Spongebob, but I see mostly PRINT cartooning tradition in his work. I see Basil Wolverton, Big Daddy Roth, and some obscure guy named Crumb.

I don't expect anyone to see the comment by now, so I figured I'd share it with you guys. Robert is one of the most brilliant guys. He LOVES art and cartooning and drawing and is very motivating.

**UPDATE 3:** well it's been 24 hours, and the subreddit is still banned. I could of course try and create another sub-reddit with a different name, but i'm not sure if that would get banned as well.

If anyone has abetter idea how this Jam could be organized, please post ideas in the comments :)

**UPDATE 2:** I created a subreddit for the Jam, but it was banned by the bots. If you can give some upvotes for this issue, so that i could be resolved faster, go here: http://redd.it/11i779

**UPDATE:** I tried creating a subreddit for Animation Jams, cleverly named Jamimation. Sadly, it was banned. I did send a Request for Reddit letting them know that this was a mistake, and i hope it'll get un-banned soon.

**Edit:** Wow! Great responses!

Listen, hey. I was thinking that maybe for the first time for this jam, it could be held in some simple place, maybe like on Reddit? Like, if we create a sub-reddit called ""AnimationJam"" i think it could be good as any place to organize the jam, as well as vote on the theme.

**So how about it, would a Sub-reddit for this jam to be a good place to organize it?**

(Does reddit allow people to make polls?)

Hey Animators!

Are you familiar with [Ludum Dare?](http://www.ludumdare.com)

I was wondering if there would be room for a jam that would concentrate on ANIMATION, with the idea being that all the people get together, do animation in teams or by themselves, with the animation being centered around a theme.

Rules:

Time: 72 Hours (Friday-Sunday) (Note: it can be longer, but traditionally Game Jams are only 72 hours. Maybe a week is better?)

Tools: Paper and pen, 3D software, Claymation, Pixilation, Sand paintings, Puppets, all tools are acceptable

Subject: A Theme that's voted on by all the participants a few weeks before the jam starts

Judging: After animations are finished/unfinished, they're released onYouTube, or orher video hosting sites (or hosted by animators themselves) and are judged based on following criteria:

(These are just some that came to my head) **Edit:** Edited from suggestions below

**Art Direction**

**Craftsmanship**

**Adherence to Theme**

**Audio** (separate)

**note:** I think that these 4 things are enough for a good jam. I don't think that  more themes are needed

Of course i know that with such strict time limit you might not get a lot of footage done, complete with score and voice acting, but that should not matter.

Heck, even if you manage to do just an animatic or a pencil test, even that will count as an entry.

What matters is proving to yourself that you can create under strict limits. The Idea is to get you to do something improvisational with the amount of expertise you've gathered during your years of making animation. I admit, it's very hard for me to do animation, because i don't want to do it alone. I hope that with this jam i might be able to find people who love the artform just as much as i do, thus helping me and other people find new friends and sources of inspiration.

How shall we get this thing started?

Also: feedback and suggestions for improvement are appreciated!

I wrote this down as I went along, and thought maybe it'd be of use to anyone attempting the same thing. I customised it a little for the subreddit and added some awkward metaphors. 

.


Organisation.

Start with a final script, make boards, then voices/foley, and lock in an animatic with timings down to the frame. Give yourself a sizeable chunk of time to get everything exactly as you want it. This drastically cuts down the editing at the end and your artists won't hate you for making constant revisions.

Or… so I hear.

For me there's little worse than realising the storyboard is flawed midway through production. That document is your co-director and when it's imperfect or illogical it's like having a saboteur in an executive position.

.

Watch Cartoons with the Sound Off.

I recommend series 4 of Venture Bros (the latest series, 5, has less action) for top-notch editing, and also new Adventure Time.

.

Cinematic Technique.

If you're boarding the thing yourself you may want to understand setting, flow, and general theory. As such, learn about cinematic technique. Shots, terminology, etc. There's the obvious basics, like the 180˚ rule, but generally aside from the essential rules you'll feel when something isn't right due to you watching TV since infancy. If that happens, ask an experienced storyboarder for advice or research the specific kind of shot you're having trouble with.

.

Ruthlessness.

Leave your animatic for a day or two, then come back to it with an axe. If something feels slow, adds nothing to the plot or just plain sucks somehow, get rid of it. Destruction is as important as creation. When traversing your plot, travel light; you can load a horse with everything you'll ever need but it won't gallop.

.

Study Directors.

Studying the trademark techniques of master directors (a swift google search will get you there) offers a sort of cheat code list for making shots interesting. Plumb the work of classic directors, not just modern ones, as directors like Jacques Tati and Sergio Leone were really on the money even way back when. 

.

Immersion.

There are lots of ways to achieve viewer immersion. In the animatic stage have After Effects make the camera move - even if it's only slightly - when a character walks, climbs, flies, etc., or when something/someone is being revealed. It makes you feel more like you're actually there.

We didn't get chance to achieve much immersion at all due to inexperience, and I really regret it. Everything you can do to suspend the viewer's disbelief ought to be done.

Other immersive techniques are blurring foreground/background (though not focus pulling mid-shot unless it's an artistic decision), not choosing shots that are unlikely for the scene (eye-level, rather than on the ceiling) unless you want the audience to feel disconnected from that character, and if you're cutting to a character as they speak it's good to lead them a bit by allowing a fraction of a second at the beginning of that shot before they talk. It's less jarring.

.

Suspense.

Receiving a new face is an event, and having dialogue arrive at the same time can be overwhelming to the viewer. If you're bringing a new character into play, see if you can't make it so we hear their voice before they appear on-screen. It also adds light suspense.

In fact, having gentle suspense throughout is a great way to keep the work engaging. It's kind of cheap, but little cheap moves are simply meeting the audience's expectations of engagement. Honestly the primary things people want to see in the mainstream are sex, violence and wealth so if you're in cinema with a ""high art"" approach you'll have trouble getting stuff picked up. It's a hard pill for a young director to swallow but it's true.

.

Sound.

To me there are four aspects to cinema. What you can see, what you can hear, what you interpret, and - a lesser aspect - what is not there. Seeing and interpreting are the artist and writer/director's domain, respectively, and ""what's not there"" is more elusive and I haven't properly defined it yet, but audio is of equal importance to the first two. 

Foley sound designers are great, but if you can't find one then get yourself to an online sound archive and use the search function like a poet. Leaping from a ladder sounds like old elevator doors closing, a wall of ticking clocks sounds like rain against a window, a robot clearing its throat is a broken gearbox/manual transmission, etc. 

Contacting a well-versed audio producer (every university has dozens) is invaluable, as you'll need to EQ the final audio track/s so everything sounds cohesive at the end - I recommend exporting your dialogue track and sound effects track separately, and sending music files as well as a music track so they have both the uncompressed music files and the timing of when they should appear.

In animation voice actors are the difference between having something watchable and something unwatchable. Put an ad out on VoicesPro for a ""lo-paid"" job. If you're at university you have a recording studio, or else they may have their own, or you know a band who have their own connections and they owe you a favour or something. Throwing a professional but out-of-work actor thirty bucks/quid/beers to record something quick is totally worth it for both of you. If it's a larger project, and not a student thing, you ought to pay much more.

Feel free to ask questions, or berate me for presuming to advise anyone on anything."	t5_2qlmp	True

Shotgun_Washington	32	4	50	"I've recently been laid off from my job and I want to pursue a career in animation however I feel that my skillset is kinda rusty would like some more education in it. Before I look into my options at a community college I was wondering if anyone here has had education from Animation Mentor. 

I understand that most of the benefits of education come from what you put into it, however a lot of for-profit schools tend to have shoddy programs that don't really prepare the student for the career in their chosen field. I'm not terribly interested in going out-of-state for education at this point, I don't want to be saddled that much more with debt.

If you went to AM did you feel that the faculty and lessons prepared you enough for a job after 18 months? Have you been to other animation schools or schools with an animation program? How do they compare? If you're an employer do you see many applicants from AM? How do their demo reels stack up compared to applicants from other schools?"	t5_2qlmp	True

First of all thank you for taking the time and looking at this. I've been working on this for a few days, just sort of messing around in photoshop with layers and animation. 

[This is what i've come up with](http://i.imgur.com/fBjJV.gif)

It's not much and there are many parts i'm not happy with (I hate that the backgrounds are so uniform and repeat so often making it look so unrealistic for one). But I really like working with the pixelated look and working so small affords me that opportunity. 

Initially I had much grander aspirations but curbed them in order to get something completed.

For someone interested in doing more, real 2D animations like this what would you suggest? I presume photoshops not the best tool for the job? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I love figuring this stuff out on my own but would really like to be pointed in some different directions. Programs (preferably free) to look at, website tutorials etc. 

Again thank you so much I feel like this doesn't even really belong here.

If you're posting one here, it needs to be clear what course of action is going to be taken beyond simply collecting signatures or likes or whatever to increase a counter.

Why do we need a rule like this one here? Well fans of a show want execs to make certain decisions (e.g. ""Don't cancel my animated Talking Heads show!"" or ""Make a cartoon about narwhals!""). While a petition helps garner attention to a cause, it should at least be sent to decision makers in some way.
