We were waiting in the boiler room for the elevator when the Cast Member(wish I could remember his name) came out to get us ready. He leaned up against the door frame a told us the the elevator was working and there were no problems with it, in a really strange way jerking his body around as if the elevator was breaking and stuff. When we got into the elevator and were ready to go he noticed someone had a birthday pin and said we should all sing happy birthday. As he started the first line he closed the door. When the ride was over and the doors reopened, he finished the last line of the song. It was pretty awesome, I love cast members who really get into character.

&gt;In the Haunted Mansion at Disney World/Disneyland, ""you"" commit suicide during the course of the ride and become a ghost.
At the beginning of the ride the ghost host (the narrator) says the only way to escape the mansion is to die, and he shows that he hanged himself. Near the end of the ride there's a moment where the ride vehicle turns around backwards and you go off a balcony, which according to this theory represents you jumping to your death.
Before this part of the ride the ghosts are all trying to scare you, but afterwards they sing excitedly and invite you to party with them. (The Grim Grinnin' Ghosts song.) The only human character in the ride, a groundskeeper, appears after the balcony drop. He faces toward the riders and seems terrified of you.
Could be totally accidental, could be an intentional subtlety by the designers, but either way I've never looked at that ride the same way since."	t5_2s0df	True

1362176184.0	19hlwe	Radiator Springs Racers Angels....THANK YOU!!!	Clarabella_Baby	62	6	8	"On February 23, 2013, me and my two kids, ages 9 and 11, were spending the day at DCA.  I had read about the fastpasses for RSR running out early and, silly me, didn't take it seriously.

I didn't want us to go to the park too early as we would be spending ALL day there, (I wanted to catch the World of Color show), so we got there around 11am.  Of course the passes were gone.  So we thought we mght brave the line....150 minutes....that's two and a half hours people!!  So no dice...we went off an enjoyed other attractions.

But in the back of my mind I knew I wanted to do the Racers.  Man they sounded amazing when you walked by them.  So we tried again later that afternoon.  100 minutes!  Whoohoo!!  That's only an hour and 40 minutes.  We can do that!  We're from Canada so who knows when we'll have another chance.  The ride sounds amazing.

So me and my little ones are headed for the line when out jump these three 'angels' who offer us the last three spots on their 6 person fastpass.  We're ecstatic....over the moon!  We say yes, follow them through the line and have the ride of our lives.

I couldn't have thanked them enough after the ride and just wanted to throw this onto reddit and offer it to the universe.  Karma is an amazing thing and I talked to my kids about paying it forward after that.

So to whomever you guys were, ""THANK YOU!!!! for an experience we won't soon forget!"""	t5_2s0df	True

I'll start"	Allformygain	53	6	53	"My favorite have to be the ""Hidden"" Mickeys around Disney, And in New Orleans Square train station. The CLicking noise you hear there is not just nothing, it is typing out, in morse code, Walt Disney opening day speech at Disneyland circa:1955. Those and Club 33.

EDIT: Thanks guys, so far it's been fun reading all these but I want to add some more. But keep on comin' with em'.

Other secrets: Walt Disney had the windows on Main street painted with names, not just any names, names of poeple who helped make Disneyland a reality. As well as basin it off a podunck small town main street.

At the firestation on Main S. The light in the top right corner window is ALWAYS on. Why? Because that was Walts' private room, when he came to visit, that light was turned on to signal to all the employees that ""The big man"" was in the park and to be on your best behaviour. When Walt died that light was kept on in memorium.

The pathway between Thunder Mountain, and Natures Wonders used to be (The big gaping hole in the side of the mountain) near the BBQ eat in (Forgot the name) In that strech of land, Animatronics are buried there under 2-4 feet of concrete. After Natures Wonders was discontinued, the employees didnt know what to do with the animatrons, so what were they to do? Bury them they said, and every time you walk on that stretch of land, you are walking feet above buried animatrons.

In the Haunted Mansion, When you get to the ballroom. Between I think it's the 5 or 6 pillar. In between those two pillars is a a spider with a spider web. But the thing is the spider is actually covering a hole. In the 80's I think is was, someone brought a BB gun, or somthing sharp and heavy, and threw it as the glass pane in the Haunted Mansion. Because of the way the Mansion was built, they couldn't fix the glass without taking off the roof of the mansion, taking out the pane, and putting it back in. So they made lemonade, They popped a spider right there, and made it look like a spiders web.

The obvious one in the Haunted Mansion, the knocked over head at the graveyard party, with the 5 talking heads. The one knocked over and broken, is Walt Disney.

Can't think of anymore right now. I'll get back to you."	t5_2s0df	True

We had a party of 8 people. It's been one guy's life long dream to go, so he was super giddy when the time was approaching.


Once we were let in, everyone hesitated to go up into the lift when she said we could go. I guess no one wanted to be the first, so I took my chance and got up there first. It's a tight fit with 4 people inside, but the lift feels a pretty nice mechanical smooth. Once we were upstairs, one waitress told us we could take as many pictures as we wanted to. I kind of wish I took more looking back on it.


I decided to go with the 5 course set menu. I felt it would be a more complete experience. After we ordered we got to go out on the balconies and look at the view. It's pretty surreal being up there and just watching all the people walk by, oblivious to the fact that you're even up there. It's also weird for us because inside the club you are so disconnected from the fact that you're inside Disneyland. It wasn't until later in the night when Fantasmic started playing that we were reminded again. We went back outside to take a peek at the view. It would have been great ...if there wasn't a huge tree right in the way. We had to go back inside though because they were going to seat some people in front of the door we came out of.


All in all we spent 4 hours inside the club. We savored every bit of it since we will most likely never ever get to go again. It was a very great experience that I am lucky to have had.

I thought it would be teeming with kids, but it was mostly adults, and older guests. Goofy was there, and I went up to him twice with no line. There was also a huge group of pin traders.  Overall, I was really impressed.

But what really made my day was when i saw the pin traders. I thought it would be fun, so I bought a lanyard, and two pins. I went back to BTRJ, and tried to get in on what was going on. I passively said that I just started, and a guy who about a couple years older gave me 4 pins for free.

I didn't  catch the persons name. But whoever you are. Thank you. I really appreciated what you did for me, and people like you make the parks , and the whole planet a better place. If I saw you again, I would've totally given you my Space Mountain Fastpass.

Living in the Bay Area I visit every few months with my girlfriend and a few friends. We drive down to Anaheim late at night and get there in the early morning. Nap a few hours after check in and hit the park bright and early for a week straight. Blended mochas, gumbo, churros, popcorn, funnel cakes fueling this madness/happiness. Picking up pins, mickey ears, vinylmations, memories and stories. Dining at Cafe Orleans, Trader Sam's, World of Color, Fireworks and Fantasmic. All of these great feelings and memories for a week straight are dashed by that feeling you get while leaving the park and going back to reality, back to normal life, back to the reasons of why disneyland is such a treat. We call this the Disney Depression. Driving back home on I-5 the same mundane view, a different patch of smells every 40 miles of cow shit. Semi after semi trucking along in the right lane, each one a reminder of the life you are heading back to. Somewhat wishing for Prozac or some pick me up to make the feeling disappear. Jokingly talk of quitting our jobs and moving to so-cal then realizing how it wouldn't work because of work, family and commitments.

Does anyone else share this sentiment or am I alone with these feels? "	t5_2s0df	True

I don't really know what to think at this point and just continue to get my stroller. Then i think, why the fuck did she have my sons cup. Next, I grab the cup, open it, and dump the drink in the trash. But, this was a souvenir cup from the blue bayou, on the pirates ride. I look inside and that bitch stole the light-up ice cube!

I knew Radiator Springs Racers was going to be cool. You can tell it's a great ride just by seeing it from afar--that beast was crafted with love. However... it really did exceed my expectations. I didn't know about (doing my best to avoid spoilers) the inside part. It was all very well done. The line lasted 35 minutes from just inside the entry arch to the front, so it moved quite fast.  
  
I've been hearing a lot of gripes from guests about Luigi's Flying Tires--that it's hard to get moving, that it's too short. My husband and I didn't move around much, but we loved the balls! We spent most of the time bottoming out because he kept reaching to grab a ball to throw in the air or hand to little kids. I'm really glad they added those. The line started about ten feet outside of the door and lasted about 40 minutes, which wasn't as long as I feared it would be.  
  
Mater's Junkyard Jamboree was more fun than I anticipated, for being the ride everyone seemed least excited about. It features seven songs created just for the ride, and the one that played when I rode it made me laugh. There was no line when I rode on it, so I don't know how fast the line moves.  
  
The food at Flo's V8 Cafe looked pretty good for the price, but we didn't eat there. The lines for most of the cones were far too long and even the popcorn one, which you think would be an easy line, moved very slowly. The pretzel and apple freeze line was very short, mostly because they don't serve soda (which comes in a cone cup, so everyone wanted a soda). I got an apple freeze, which was *weird*. I got it because a bunch of guests said it was good, but I expected it to taste like the fruit, not apple *pie*. It was very cinnamony, and had too much sugar so I couldn't finish it. I didn't hate it, just too much sugar for me.  
  
Buena Vista Street is quite lovely. The stores are spacious, and Clarabelle's serves Dreyer's ice cream. I got a hot roast beef sandwhich at Fiddler, Fifer, and Practical's (AKA Starbucks) and thought it was really good! The bun was soft and warm, and the cheese was gooey. I was quite happy with my choice.

Husband and I took our two kids to Disneyland last week to meet up with some relatives we hadnt seen in quite a while. It was my first time and my daughters fifth birthday. 

To be honest I was not expecting to like it. Growing up I never was a Disney person. So I was shocked when we needed to add a day to our three day passes, we enjoyed it so much. We celebrated my daughters birthday with a character dinner at Ariels Grotto. 

Her in her princess dress decked out with a tiara from a flower girl stint, play pearls and copying the gentele air of the princesses is something I will never, ever forget. Our son loved LOVED the princesses as well, as soon as he realized he would get hugs and cuddles. He even bust a move for Jasmine in the middle of the restaurant and she joined in after being suitably impressed by his coutrship dance. 

It was magical. Even with the crowds. Even with the money spent. Even with in laws. 

Then I lost my phone. Foolishly I had been recording those moments on a phone and assumed dropbox was doing its thing. Not realizing I had maxed out my capasity months ago. I went and left it on a UA flight from LAX to Denver. 

So now I am just heart broken. Not only because of our vacation photos, but the months of photos, including the last photos taken of our dog who had to be put down weeks before we left. 

When I realized what I had done in the Denver airport and that no one could find it for me, I started to cry and even worse my daughter did too. The regret is massive, guilt even worse. Thank goodness we haphazardly took advantage of the photopass people and my inlaws have a few of our kids. But still. Its just not the same. 

Thanks for reading this wall of text if you made it this far folks. Heres a friendly PSA, back you stuff up, then back it up again, and back it up again for good measure.

But here is the part I enjoyed most, and I don't mean to sound like a salesman, but through this site called, [Ebates.com](http://www.ebates.com/), they give you cash back on your purchase through [Orbitz.com](http://www.orbitz.com/things-to-do/) and right now the rate is 5.25% back on total purchase of an activity event( Disneyland Tickets). After the cash back you get another $15 off each ticket bringing the total to $260 a piece which would normally buy you a 3-day hopper. I was lucky enough to get 10.5% back on my purchase but the rate fluctuates. There is also travelocity and other popular sites they offer money back on. You could find the hotel you want to find in the list of sites supported and maybe get money back on them as well. You simply print out your voucher and take it to a kiosk and they give you your tickets. It's fast simple and it worked through Orbitz. It was the best type of deal I could find.

1343761634.0	xgp0n	What is the best way to tell Disneyland of a cast member who went above &amp; beyond?	midgetlotterywinner	23	4	11	"The title says it all, but here's a tl;dr for some back story on why we want to make the effort to compliment the cast member:

Last week my wife &amp; I took our 4 year-old to Disneyland (Anaheim) for his first time.  He's a bit of a Star Wars nut, so first thing?  Star Tours.  He loved it, of course, and it was my first time on that too so we had a blast.  My son has already seen the movies (Episodes IV-VI) a dozen times and is a true Jedi at heart (unless he misses a nap, then it's off to the Dark Side).

Then he *insisted* on doing the Jedi Training at the Tomorrowland stage.  If you haven't seen this before, it's where some cast members dressed as Jedi take little kids, give them Jedi robes and little lightsabers, and teach them a few moves.  THEN the stage opens up, Dath Vader &amp; Maul come out and the kids do their lightsaber moves on them, one at a time.  At the end of the training the kids get a little diploma.

So my son and I are waiting for the Jedi selection process.  He's clearly the smallest...most of the kids look like they're over 5.  But they're playing Star Wars soundtrack music in the background while they set up for the training and my son is standing up ""conducting"" the soundtrack music.  This gets the attention of one of the cast members...a guy named Jason.  He goes up and talks with my son for a good two to three minutes, chatting him up and gauging his enthusiasm.

Eventually the selection process starts and Jason stays nearby, hinting to the ""Jedi trainer"" to choose my son.  My boy gets chosen, goes up and does his best with the little exercises...again, he's the youngest &amp; smallest so he needed a little help.

But then two Stormtroopers rush in, the stage open up, and once the Darths pop out with the loud music, my son starts to freak out and yep...tears start to fall.  My wife and I were ready to pull him out, but Jason jumps in, takes my son to the side and cools him out, staying with him and being his personal cheerleader, giving him the confidence to go up against Lord Vader himself.  Then he escorts my son back to us ensuring that, in the end, my boy had a great time.

Without this guy Jason, we would have had to pull our son out of the Jedi Training ""thing"", breaking his heart and probably making him a wreck for the rest of the day.  I know they're ""trained"" to deal with kids who get overwhelmed, but to us he really went above &amp; beyond.  He needs to be credited.  

I see there's a link on the Disneyland site to contact them:
[https://disneyland.disney.go.com/help/email/](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/help/email/) but I wonder if anyone knows of a more appropriate method of communication that gives Jason the best chance of getting the credit he deserves.

(And yes, I recognize that Jedi Training was probably not 100% appropriate for a 4 year-old, but once he heard about it there was no...and I mean **NO** changing his mind.  Plus, we promised him that Disneyland was ""his day"".)

**tl;dr - What's the most effective way of praising a cast member so he/she gets recognized?**

Thanks for your time.

We went on a couple rides and wandered around, and in the distance, I saw it. The sign for Merida’s meet and greet. There were a bunch of kids in line, and even though Brave is one of my favorite Disney movies, I didn’t feel like I should get in line to meet her. We walked beside the line until I saw her and stopped in my tracks. Had I been the age of the girls in line, I’d have thought she was the real thing. We got a little closer and I took in her little themed area. Cream canvas tent (perfectly fitting her time period), and a wooden style cart with the three animatronic brothers in it, reacting to what she said. I felt like a little kid again, standing beside her “encampment”. We stood there for not even a minute, before she looked up and saw me, and smiled. She held up a hand, telling me to wait a second and not walk away. When the girl she was taking photos with walked away with her mom, Merida walked over to the metal barriers and said hi, in the most adorable, perfect character voice.
“Hi…” I answered, really shy. She asked me why I was so shy and I told her she was my favorite princess. She said she could tell, and offered to give me a hug. I accepted and she gave me one of the most genuine hugs I think I’ve ever received. She returned to her line and I started to walk away. Before I could stop myself, I started to cry, with the biggest grin on my face. After calming myself, we continued with our day. About an hour and a half later, we were trying to kill time before our Blue Bayou dinner reservations. The next activity was mine to choose, and I decided I wanted to go back to Merida, to thank her and get a picture to remember the day by. We trekked back to the area, and got in line. And waited. And waited. But it was so worth it. When I finally walked up to her, I thanked her for stepping away from the group before. She seemed so excited to see me, and pulled me over to the cart her bear brothers were in. She told me about how when I was standing off t the side, her brothers said that I looked like her, and how they were wondering if I could come home to Scotland with them and be their second sister. Of course, being who I am, I accepted, and she swept me into another hug. We stepped back more out into the open area of the enclosure, and she said she wanted to ask me something else. She grinned very wide and asked if I wanted to be best friends. I accepted again, and we pinky swore on it (which my wonderful boyfriend got a picture of). We took a few more pictures, and I said goodbye. She said for me to wait outside the barricades again for her, and that it’d only be a minute. When she finished the line of girls, she walked out to my boyfriend and I, and walked with us all the way back to where the cast leaves to take breaks/be done for the day, her arm around my shoulder. She said that she wanted me to come back and visit her, and to always remember to smile no matter what happens because “Merida loves you.” She said goodbye and I waved to her as she rounded the corner. As soon as she left, I began to cry again. My fear that the Disney magic would be gone was completely unfounded, and I swear, the theme park will never be the same again. We left a compliment at Guest Services when we left.
So by making this post, I want to commend Disney for excellent casting, and to do a call to arms for Reddit. If you know the girl who was Merida at Disneyland on July 8th, 2013, or know someone who knows her, please PM me. I’d love to tell her just how much what she did meant to me, person to person.

Thanks for reading, and sorry for the Wall of Text :)

I really wanted to take a visit there this Thursday before I leave for an east coast trip, yet have been having trouble finding anyone to go with. All my friends are either busy or blocked out. Now I'm thinking about going by myself. It would be an interesting adventure as I've never done that before (esp. in such crowded times), and I mostly wanted to stick to things I haven't done yet like see Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln. I've also never done single rider so there's something to be said for that.

Does anyone have any ideas/input/personal anecdotes from doing so themselves? Would love to hear your thoughts! :)

Edit: Thanks everyone for the feedback!! Got more responses than I expected, all of them very nice and encouraging. I'm now super excited to embark on my solo adventure. This is the list of things I've decided to do as a sort of Disney ""bucket list"" (going alone was on that too):

Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln

See a show at the Golden Horseshoe

Visit the Walt Disney Imagineering Blue Sky Cellar

Take pictures with some of the characters for friends

Research interesting hidden Mickeys and facts, then go to the park to hunt them down

Go on either a horse-drawn streetcar or a horseless carriage

Ride at least two rides single rider

Go on the Mark Twain Riverboat

Watch Muppet Vision 3D (okay maybe not as exciting as the others but I've never done it)

Talk to cast members and see what they have to say!

Watch the various singing performers

This should be more than enough, thanks again everyone! I hope there is a reddit Disneyland meetup soon, I'm always looking to make new friends. :)"	t5_2s0df	True

This handy feature makes it easy to determine what your next ride should be if it has a short wait and what rides to avoid/fast pass. 

The negatives: The community! I cannot say enough bad things about the MouseWait forums and its community members. They all know each other and gang up on new members. There are about 70 of them who all knew each other and they just treat other members so badly.Plus they are rude and extremely smarky. Just a horrible forums/members.

I love Disneyland and practically grew up there. I have had passes for 10 years almost now and I've watched it go up significantly every year. $649 is the price of the most expensive pass now. What is it going to be this year? Next year? I'm sorry but minimum wage is not getting much higher. I'm sitting here wondering how I will ever be able to get passes for my family when I have kids. By then they will be over $1000. Did Walt Disney really mean for this to happen? Its funny because Disney makes money no matter how expensive their prices are. If passes were $2000 I think everyone would still buy it. I am sadened by this. It was only $35 to get into the park when I was little. The first year I got a pass it was only $100.

I read about other people having these problems and the most common ""cure"" was to start planning their next trip. Unfortunately for me I'm planning on going into the Marines in a few months, so I have no idea when the next time I could go to WDW would be. So planning my next visit is even more depressing.

I've never been depressed about anything. I've always handled bad situations well (like actually bad, this is not a bad situation) but for some reason I cannot shake this.

On ITS A SMALL WORLD, flounder always makes me cringe. He's almost identical to the ones found in the LITTLE MERMAID ride. All other disney characters added to SMALL WORLD at least have some sort of ""mary blair"" stylization to them.



On the flip side, I did notice a few changes on ""Little Mermaid"" that made me happy.  (I haven't been in the park for 4 months...)

* Ariel in the UNDER THE SEA sequence no longer has ""Bride of Frankenstein"" hair.
* The Ariel animated sequences were no longer 3-D super clean computer animation and now had more of a hand drawn look.

As I spend my last few weeks of summer yearning to get down to Anaheim again soon, I've been thinking about some of my best park moments. Being there alone with my girlfriend for the first time at night, while we crazily recorded video of ourselves running around to and from rides, and through gift shops and the Mad Hatter, was a pretty fun moment. Or getting a few hours to myself in the park with my camera, and snapping away the easily missed details of the park. Or seeing my younger brother (constantly pretending he's too cool for most rides) really enjoy a lot of the rides and wanting to go back again.

Space Mountain and the Matterhorn are my two favorite rides. Space Mountain because I cannot see where I am heading because of the darkness; and The Matterhorn because I will always sit in the rear of the sled, but will refuse to ride if i have to sit up front. I am visiting Disneyland for the first time since 1998, and in all my 27 years of being alive, I cannot ride Splash Mountain. I get extremely nervous and anxious when I am 50 feet away from it.

I have two things I'd change.

1. Autopia. I think I would get rid of it, or at the very least, make it a mostly indoor ride. The amount of real estate it takes is massive, and the payoff is a somewhat uninspired ride that kids of all ages love, but adults don't really care for (well, because adults can drive *for real*). I know it's been around forever, but Disneyland is feeling a little cramped for space (there is room for renovation, but not a lot for addition) and I think this space could be used for a number of new and exciting things!

2. It's a Small World. I love this ride. It's possibly *the* quintessential Disneyland attraction (up there with Peter Pan). It has a beautiful history and a great message. However, a lot of it is starting to feel really dated, in the bad way, especially comparing to the quality things they can do in new rides like Ariel's Undersea Adventure. I say keep the dolls as they are, but replace *almost all* of the scenery with higher quality plastic/fiberglass/plaster/whatever scenery. A lot of small world is painted plywood that you can see the hammered together stands.

*“She’s so beautiful,” Michael had sighed, and then we looked at each other and we instantly knew what we had to do. I’m not proud of it, and it was wrong, but it had to be done. To show our admiration, we lifted up Wendy’s skirt and left our signatures on her, shall we say, animatronic person.

1367621219.0	1dnc0x	May 24th, the 24 hour party at Disneyland, will be a Monstrous disaster... here's why.	gdraper99	21	10	18	"May 24th is less than a month away, and it will mark the start of what Disney is calling their ""Monstrous Summer.""  They decided to come up with this 24 hour party idea to kick-start their summer with BOTH Disneyland AND California adventure remaining open between 6 AM on 5/24 till 6 AM on 5/25.  (with lots of exceptions)

What could possibly go wrong?

Well, lots of things. like:

* May 24th is a Friday
* Most annual passes can attend (only the cheap one is blocked, and who wouldn't want to be in Disneyland at Sunrise?)
* May 24th is the start of a holiday weekend - Memorial day weekend
* Memorial day weekend is a three day weekend/holiday for a lot of people
* May 24th is a GRAD NITE, with tens of thousands of high schoolers forced into the park and who can't leave
* Because of Grad Nite, most of DCA is closed.


So, unlike ""one more disney day"" that [was a disaster](http://miceage.micechat.com/allutz/al030212a.htm) because 106K people showed up to spend 24 hours on a Wednesday in February in a park that only holds ~65K, Disney decided to move the date to one that more people could attend because it's a holiday.  Add onto that the Grad Night problem, and you have a whole new disaster waiting to happen.


**Grad Nite, May 24th** will Destroy this park. Why?   Because of this: http://i.imgur.com/FdV54sK.jpg [more from the post on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DisneylandGradNite/posts/599030450130061)

Selected excerpts about the Grad Nite on May 24th from the posts on the Disneyland Grad Night facebook page.  As far as I can tell, these are official unless changed:

""Grad Nite tickets are Park Hopper ticket[s] which allows Grad Nite seniors to enjoy both parks all day long. The Grad Nite Private Party is in Disney California Adventure. while some “Monstrous Summer” activities will take place in parts of Disney California Adventure during Grad Nite, these will not be in the area’s reserved for your special night, and most of the theme park will still be open exclusively for Grad Nite attendees beginning at 11 p.m. The party continues with exclusive use of select areas of Disney California Adventure [for only Grad Nite attendees] all the way through until 3:00 a.m. Disneyland Park will only be open to normal park guests after 9pm. For the seniors to be able to get into the private Grad Nite Party areas in Disney California Adventure they will have to have their special Grad Nite park ticket as well as their event wrist bands. Grads will mix-in with Day Guests and then have their own private celebration at night in Disney California Adventure. *There will not be 24 hour participants in the designated Grad Nite party areas, which is all of Disney California Adventure, except for Buena Vista Street, The Mad T Party area and the Soarin' Attraction.*""

Bold and *italics* as well as [edits] by me.  Except was edited from several posts into one paragraph but no content was changed.


So, **DCA is CLOSED May 24th from 11 PM till 3 AM** with the exception of Mad T Party, Soarin' and Buena Vista Street.



In case you are wondering, *I plan on going* to watch Disney destroy itself.  It will be fun. I can't see anyone attending the 24 hours party being happy about most of DCA being closed from 11 PM 5/24 till 3AM 5/25, nor can I see Grads being happy they have to share part of DCA with all the regular day guests.  They got screwed. It will be interesting to see if some of the schools who attend this will want to return.

The 3 year old is 37"" so she won't be able to go on any of the rides that the 9 year old wants to go on. Do you have any suggestions on what could be an enjoyable day for the both of them? I'm bringing a friend so I was thinking splitting up and just waiting outside while my friend took the 9 year old on the bigger attractions?

1363632527.0	1ajffq	The Walk in Walt's Disneyland Footsteps Tour 	DevonOO7	14	2	14	Yesterday, I went on the tour. It was $109 and included lunch. First we walked around Main Street telling us stories about Walt.  We went into the entrance of Club 33 and took pictures in the elevator. We went on Peter Pan's flight. More talking split up with audio clips and we went on It's a Small World. We wandered back to the area before Mr. Lincoln, with all of the models of Disneyland. We walked back to the guided tours stand and half of the group started their lunch while the other half went up to Walt's apartment. After about 15 minutes the two halls switch. After lunch the tour is over. It took about 2.5 - 3 hours. Was it worth it? Well it depends on how much you already know about Walt and how badly you want to see Club 33/ Walt's apartment. Pretty much everything the guide said were things I already knew from reading Wikipedia pages, books, and watching videos. The apartment and Club 33 were definitely the highlights of the tour and what made it worth it form me. Lunch was pretty good, just a sandwich, chips, a bottle of coke, and a delicious caramel tart. Also skipping the lines for the rides was a bonus.	t5_2s0df	True

1345746877.0	ypixv	I just got back from Disneyland and these are some thoughts I had on all the new things and remodels.	tryingtoberelevant	18	6	46	"I'll start with DCA:

**Cars Land**: Awesome new land. My favorite part is how it so closely mimics the movie. My son absolutely loved it and wanted to spend a lot of time there. We could only spend so much time, though, because there's only three rides and the rest of it is just shops filled with the typical Disney overpriced junk. There was some cool new Cars Land merchandise. The best part is when you're there at night. The lights look amazing.

**Mater's Junkyard Jamboree**: I thought this was a great ride. It's big enough that the line is never really long and everyone I watched seemed to really be enjoying it. 

**Luigi's Flying Tires**: Most of what I read about this ride is true. It seems like a really cool concept but it's a little boring and hard to maneuver. My son and other kids were clearly enjoying it and I thought it was just OK. The line for this ride is always long and not worth it imo. They also took away the beach balls so you can't even throw them at people anymore. Where's the fun in that?

**Radiator Springs Racers**: Great ride but it is always breaking down (as most people say). I got in line right at 7:00am and waited for an hour a half because it took 45 minutes to get the thing working right. Once I finally got on, I really did enjoy it. It's cool, modern, and fun. It goes really fast which makes me wish I had the patience to wait in line one more time to ride it again and take in everything. Once this rides popularity dies down, I will ride it again. 

**Flo's V8 Cafe**: This place is great. There are plenty of seating areas so you're sure to find a table quickly. The food is...well...like every other Disney restaurant - sub-par. I had the American Breakfast which was pretty gross but I was able to swallow it. I saw a few people going for the banana caramel french toast which looked good because it was smothered in sugar. They do have cute little Lightning McQueen souvenir boxes for the kids, those are fun. 

**Carthay Circle Restaurant**:  I dined here because I'm a foodie and I don't mind spending money on good food. I was disappointed. But first let me say that the interior is amazing. It's a beautiful restaurant filled with the Disney detail I love so much. Now on to the food: I ordered the Jamaican Jerk Halibut over diced mangoes and the fish was dry and overcooked. The flavor was decent but definitely not my favorite dish. I also ordered a mojito and it wasn't very good. In addition to the fish, I ordered a simple salad which was quite good. They put a vinaigrette over it and placed some dried apricots around the edges. They also included some deep fried cheese balls which I thought was weird but they were tasty. The fruit on the salad helped balance out the bitterness on some of the greens. For dessert I had the Monte Cristo Banana Split which was quite tasty. Disney knows how to do desserts. My son had the Green Apple Caramel Parfait Push Pop which has two different sorbet flavors: Green Apple and Lemon Raspberry. They drizzle the inside with caramel and add a few other little things. I sampled a bit and enjoyed it. The green apple sorbet really tasted just like an apple which surprised me. Last thing, the service was slow. Our waitress was nice but it seemed like the kitchen didn't have it going on. She didn't check on us as frequently, either. After about 20 or 30 minutes they brought out a bowl of their cheddar, bacon, jalapeno biscuits with apricot butter as a ""sorry, we're slacking."" I didn't say anything about us having to wait for our food, I didn't mind much. It was a nice gesture. The biscuits were decent but they needed more bacon and jalapeno to make them superb. 

**Buena Vista Street**: I really love Buena Vista street. The new entrance works so well with the rest of the park. Walt and Mickey's statue is a great addition. Starbucks and Clarabelle's are right next to each other which is very convenient. Clarabelle's offers a hand dipped ice cream bar which is delicious. The coffee is good but, as with everything else, overpriced. It's nice being able to run over there in the afternoon to pick up your favorite drink and get a boost. The stores along there are really nice, too, and staff is incredibly friendly. It wasn't too crowded in the stores so I enjoyed that. 

Overall, I think DCA looks great. I actually spent quite a bit of time there which is not the norm for me. The restaurants in the back (by Goofy's Sky School) are actually pretty good. I ate at the Greek one and enjoyed it. The live entertainment was nice as well. 

**Disneyland**

**Matterhorn**: I didn't see much difference with the snow on the mountain but I know they did a lot of work on it. Each car now seat three, rather than four, which some people were complaining about but the way I see it is that when they sat four, most riders rode individually so they didn't have to have anybody in their lap. Now it's a guaranteed 3 rather than a likely 2 if that makes sense. Anyway, the first time I rode I sat in the back. It bumped a lot and was not comfortable. The second time I sat in the middle and while it was a little more cramped, I wasn't jerked around as much. Overall, the ride is fine but I don't think it's the best remodel. Oh well, I still enjoy it. 

I can't really think of much else right now. I didn't make it to the Carnation Cafe but it looked great from the outside. The Ghiradelli Soda Fountain and Chocolate Shop in DCA was tasty, I recommend going there. 

Some of the CM's I ran into have been grumpy. It was hot when we went, mid-nineties, so I understand. But I did miss the friendly CM's. 

Alright, I'll add more if you guys have questions but that's what I got for now. I would love to hear everyone's opinion on the recent changes to the parks if you have it. Also, what do you think of the prices? Do you think the recent changes warrant such large price increases? I'm not sure what my final thoughts on that are yet.

1350493570.0	11mzjs	Crowds at Disneyland: Lines aren't long even though the park is packed--is this unusual?	Lick_The_Blade	14	3	19	"Hello!  I made my first trip to Disneyland last week and was wanting to get a little feedback from more frequent visitors about the crowds.  According to my research, the days I went were not usually busy (October 11-12, rated a 2 out of 10 by Touring Plans).  Most ride lines were not that bad, averaging 10-20 minutes with the exceptions being Haunted Mansion and Space Mountain (45-120 minute waits).  
  
So, what confused me is just how busy the park felt compared to those waits.  I know the lines have to be worse in the summer, but it felt like the park could not contain any more people than I saw.  Every inch of sidewalk was packed and it was incredibly difficult to move around the mobs of people.  Add in all the strollers and wheelchairs and sometimes I felt like I'd never be able to get through to the next ride.  
  
Is this normal or did I have an unusual experience?  I know that on one day it was extra busy from 4-7 because of the Halloween party, but it was crowded even before the early entry for partygoers.  
  
As an aside, I would like to thank every cast member at DLR.  Simply the highest concentration of nice, helpful humans I've ever encountered. "	t5_2s0df	True

1370290554.0	1flq22	I added parking to my AP yesterday, but was also charged the difference for yesterday's increase in AP prices. Is this a normal practice??	gamedreamz	13	4	11	Hi Reddit. Yesterday, I went to the main ticketing office with the intention of adding parking to my existing Southern California Annual Pass that I purchased back in Feb. While waiting in line for 45 minutes, I was informed by a wandering cast member that parking was an additional $139 (up from $129 a day before). I figured that was okay since I had planned to visit the park enough times in the future to make it worth it. However, upon arriving to the window and making my request, I realized that the customer rep had charged me $169 to my card for the parking. When I asked her why, she told me that I also had to pay the difference ($30) between the old annual pass price and the new annual pass price IN ADDITION to the parking fee. I find it hard to swallow that adding parking to an existing AP should be impacted by the newly implemented AP price. Shouldn't I be grandfathered in?

I am curious to hear r/Disneylands options for the area and there thoughts on why Disney isn't more pet friendly.

This is AWESOME but for those redditors who live far from the parks, I can see that it would get annoying (as evidenced by downvotes). 

Can we create a /r/disneymeetup (for all parks?) or create individual meetups on the reddit meetup page? 

What do you guys think? I go about once a month, and would love to meet other redditors, but never have. Disneyland is a complicated place to navigate when meeting others, so having something organized would be nice I think.

My question is... what is it? What changes have they made to the ride? My AP has expired and I am unable to check on things myself, so I am desperately wondering what it is they are referring to by saying that ""New Curse Unleashed on Indiana Jones Adventure."""	t5_2s0df	True

While we were there, I noticed that Innoventions had drastically changed. Instead of entering at the bottom, you entered at the second story (the former exit). The building did not rotate as it previously had, and it completely cut out the Tom Morrow and Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow sections. Was there a reason for this? And is it permanent? 	t5_2s0df	True

1372794800.0	1hinxi	1-day 2-park visit: THE GAMEPLAN!	peanutismint	11	1	4	"I went to Disneyland from the UK for the first time in 2011, and as a 28-year-old heterosexual male I can say without shame that it was the most magical day of my life...!!  We were doing a whistle-stop tour of CA, so could only afford one day at the park, but if I do say so myself we worked those queues like pros:

We entered about 9am and spent the first few hours getting fast-pass tickets to come back to busy attractions later in the day, and visiting attractions with shorter wait times by utilising the single-rider queues. By the time we'd seen the character parade (around 4pm?) we'd pretty much done everything we'd wanted to in the main park and had tickets to come do the other stuff after the fireworks (around 9pm?), so we decided to take a chance and leave the park to buy an upgrade to access California Adventure. After a few rides in there (Tower Of Terror = my favourite attraction of the entire day!!), we got back into the main park in time to meet up with our friends, watch the fireworks AND then the Mickey's Fantasmic show, and still had time to fit in about 4 more rides and then catch the last show of Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln.

So all in all, a fantastic day of fun, which goes to prove that whilst it's recommended for big Disney fans to spend more than one day in the park, it **IS** doable to see most stuff in both parks in one day if that's all you can spare.

Well after all that, I'm excited to say that I'm going back later this month!! I can't wait. I've managed to convince my traveling companions to come with me and try to do the same again, but does anybody have any tips for doing everything in one day?  The only improvements I'd like to make over the last visit would be that last time the Matterhorn was closed the entire day :-( so I'd love to go on that this time; also there's that new Cars ride at California Adventure that was in the process of being built when I was there last, so I'd love to get on that too....

**TL;DR:** Had pretty much the PERFECT trip to both Disneyland parks in one day; looking for tips to improve/re-create for the next trip!"	t5_2s0df	True

There were a things i figured i'd bring up that caught my eye through out the trip.

The new Buena Vista street (although beautiful), lacks color and character when put to comparison to DLs main street usa.  All of the buildings have this single beige color thats just kind of bland. It may seem like a nit picking kind of thing, but i think any artist can agree - a little color and can go a long way.

As for Cars Land, aesthetically - the place was perfect. Any fan of the films, will greatly love the area.  Having said that,  if you are not a fan of Cars, it puts you in this weird limbo where you still hate the movie and whats its done to Pixar's image, but you are still having fun. Kind of awkward...

That's my 2 cents - feel free to agree or disagree :)"	t5_2s0df	True

Autotopia...WAS a horrible experience...as I was warned. A car broke down halfway through, and we sat for about 20 mins.
Star Tours was awesome! Went twice.
Indiana Jones was decent, but was a tad short.
Tower of Terror was a LOT more fun than I thought it was going to be.

Every visit to DCA this year has involved me walking down Buena Vista Street and pining after Carthay Circle -- so I figured a World of Color dining package there would be a pretty darn good birthday present to myself. Besides, that'll mean I won't have to run over to Grizzly River Run first thing in the morning, right? 

I've heard of the WoC dining packages and have done some research, but I have one very specific question: are the fastpasses that you receive unique to the dining packages (i.e., you get extra-good seats reserved JUST for people who have done the dining package), or are they the same fastpasses from the general WoC fastpass distribution? 

The reason why I am asking is because I want to get a good idea of how soon I'd have to start saving seats for WoC later that night. I'm going with a fairly big group of people and it'll be most of their first times watching World of Color. I remember being in the very front row the first time I watched it, and that made it so much more magical for me. I'd love to be able to give others that same experience as well :)"	t5_2s0df	True

Our plan is to get married at the crack of dawn at our airport with a few friends. When I say crack of dawn I mean like 3:30-4:00 AM. We'd be all dressed up, have a small ceremony, take some silly photos in the almost empty airport, then hop the first plane to Disneyland. We'd drop our bags at the hotel and head into the park still dressed up and spend our wedding day taking ridiculous photos.

The thing I'm worried about is getting denied entry at the front gate. I know you can't wear wedding dresses in the park because of safety and concern for being considered an employee. My dress is going to be short and not white, but will probably be a light-ish color (kinda like [this](http://www.trashydiva.com/shop/trashydiva-honeydress-yellowpoplin) with either shorts and/or a petticoat underneath) and I'll have a small well-secured hair-piece. He'll be in a suit/tie, not black, and he'll probably be without the jacket for most of the day. We're fully prepared to be uncomfortable for a day and I'm guessing I'll probably ruin my dress, but I'm pretty okay with that. 

We're not trying to sneak a ceremony into the park. We'll already be married when we get there. We're not bringing in a fancy camera. Yes, we'll look a bit out of place since we won't be wearing shorts and a baggy shirt. I'd say we won't look any more dressed up than what people wore to Dapper Day. And it'll just be the two of us, unless of course you guys crash my wedding.

So, is there any chance we'd be turned away at the gate? Would we still be able to get ""Just Married"" pins/ears? I don't want to get excited for a plan that won't work, but it's hard not to be excited about Disneyland, especially since my fiance has never been to a Disney park.

Edit: Thanks guys! I can now go back to being excited and not worrying! :D"	t5_2s0df	True

To play the game, you just have to call ""HOLLISTER"" whenever you see someone wearing an article of Hollister clothing.  It looks so much like other brands (Ambercrombie, American Eagle, etc...) that it can be challenging not to miscall it.  

You lose a point if you miscall (oops, that was ambercrombie) and the loser buys the winner a snack at the end of the day.

Here's some back story, I graduated in 2008 and visited Disneyland the summer after. I had gone with my girlfriend at the time and we decided to browse Downtown Disney. I went into the World of Disney and saw the cap that I REALLY wanted. It lit up and said Class of '08 on it or something along those lines. She convinced me not to get it yet seeing how it was the beginning of the day and I'd be carrying it all over the park, to which she had a valid point.

The day passed and we went back, only to find out that all of the caps that they had were completely sold out. Weren't getting any more. I even checked the day after only to be disappointed again.

Glabrous	8	2	14	"Taking the family next month for a 5 day stint, and due to special health needs we're planning on bringing some food and beverages into the park. I'm guessing I'm over thinking it, but on the off chance someone has a tip I thought I would ask for advice. Is there a particular nifty backpack that you would recommend? 

I'm also curious about how having a backpack works with moving between California Adventures and DL proper. Can I expect to get my backpack checked at the entrance of each park? Are backpacks left in a designated area while I'm on a ride or do I need to designate a person in my group to watch it? I realize it would be impractical or unsafe to take a backpack on many of the rides there.

She can walk on it pretty normally, but she's worried that she won't be able to walk 10-hour-days without crutches or possibly a wheelchair. Does anyone have any experience with this?

1367624655.0	1dnfot	Best hotels to stay around Disneyland?	champion_dave	10	4	14	Wife and I are going in August, and are wondering what the best hotels to stay at are. The Hilton has good reviews, as does the Crowne plaza, but I'm wondering what your experiences are. We'd prefer one that's quite close to Disneyland so that we can walk, as well as go to the parks in the morning, come back and swim in the afternoon, then go to the parks in the evening. Any suggestions would help!	t5_2s0df	True

1363268370.0	1aa7dc	I'm taking my friend with Aspergers to Disneyland so I have a few questions out the disability card?	koreandino	14	9	21	"I'm in a club that helps low/high-functioning disabled students. I'm taking my bud Zack with Aspergers to Disneyland, cuz he loves Disney, but he has Social Anxiety Disorders and Macrophobia (fear of waiting) so lunch lines at school cause him panic and rage. So his mom told me about a card that could help him with the lines and people. I'm almost completely lost and I wanted to ask a few questions. 

1) How do I get the card? 
2) Should I bring documentation/ID?
3) How old do I have to be to ask for one?
4) Will it help with the fear of lines and strangers?
5) He HATES to talk about it, so will cast members be asking for his condition all day?
6) How does the card exactly work? Like a Fastpass?

Thank you so much for your time in advance. I joined the site just so that I could ask and have an awesome day with this guy! "	t5_2s0df	True
1363025868.0	1a3fk3	Shoes or Flip flops? Plus a few more questions :)	cdrdj	7	1	41	"I'm finally going to be visiting again for the first time since I was a young kid so I want to make sure I get the most out of this trip. I will be at DL and DCA with my friends on April 30, May 1 and 2.

* For you veterans out there, would you suggest any particular foot wear? Are shoes too hot or will flip flops be uncomfortable after a whole days worth of walking?

* For the Early magic hour, I've read on a DIS thread that there are only a specific amount of attractions open at that time. Is there any suggestions as to where to go first to make the most out of that first hour?

* How good and crowded is the reserved spot for World of Color when you get the Carthay Circle dining option?

* I've gone through pages and pages of r/disneyland to read up on as many tips and not-so-well-known ""secrets"" but would like to hear some more if you've got any? Especially for those particular dates I will be going on. For example: the Lilly Belle train, the Photopass +, water being freely available throughout, etc.

Any help would be very much appreciated. Thank you in advance!"	t5_2s0df	True
1362348662.0	19lkph	California Adventure...what do you think? 	sailorearth	10	5	29	"My partner and I are considering a birthday trip this April but he is VERY RESISTANT to the idea of California Adventure.  Even if World of Color seems great, he does not want to bother with Carthay prices for a decent seat.  He does not want to pay hundreds of dollars for 6 hours of fun when the same could be spent next door for 12 hours of fun.  Carsland seems like it is for little kids. Whine whine whine party pooper etc.

Why? The last time I went to the DL resort was about 2009 and we spent the day in California Adventure. The lagoon was being drained for what would turn out to be World of Color.  Otherwise, it was a neat little trip with corn dogs and Toy Story Mania.  But we finished everything by about 4pm.  We had an okay time but it felt like a bit of a let down. This time, I'm curious and interested to see the developments.

I'd like to hear your personal opinions on CA so we can figure out our vacation birthday trip!! Thanks!

1361256047.0	18t08r	Looking for advice on trip to Disneyland	beyerch	9	2	19	"Hi,

I'm looking to take our family from Chicago to CA to visit Disneyland this summer.  The plan so far is to go out for a week (Sunday - Sat) in late July.  

I would love some advice/tips/tricks/etc, especially in regards to:

- Is it worth it to stay at one of the ""official"" hotels at the park?  It seems they are rather expensive; however, they do seem to offer some convenience and a few perks such as early entrance to the park.  Is it worth it?  Are there are secret discounts?  Which one is best/better?  If it's not worth it to stay at one of the ""official"" hotels, what is a good alternative?

- What are the ""absolutely must see"" items?

- What are the tricks to get neat/special stuff?  I've seen a couple comments about getting to pilot/getting honory badges, etc.  Any compilations out there?

- My wife and kids would love to see some real Redwood trees....  Is there anywhere near Anaheim that would help us out with that?  Any other cool locations near the Anaheim area to check out?

While I have some $ to spend, I want to make sure I maximize it and make sure we don't miss anything.  Any advice greatly appreciated!

Thanks!"	t5_2s0df	True
1361096830.0	18or12	Visited disneyland this past weekend, Fastpass enforcement will start on Tuesday Feb 19th.	Senor_Taco11	9	4	12	"First post on reddit and thought I had to share. I was at disneyland this past weekend with my girlfriend and was told by multiple cast members from different rides in Disneyland/DCA that starting Tuesday they will enforce the return times on the fastpasses. This really bums us out, because as pass holders we like to take our time spending our days there relaxing and not rushing to and from rides.

Anyway, I want to see as much as possible.  I am going on a Monday and expect crowds to be at a minimum.  Park hours are 10am to 8pm and I dont need to see any shows or parades - just rides, rides, rides!  Any advice on how to divide and conquer DCA and DL in a day would be great!

I should also mention I'm a Vinylmation collector so throwing in a little trading time would be ideal as well.  I've never traded in a park so I'm psyched.  "	t5_2s0df	True

The plan in a nutshell:  We will all be at Disneyland (doing our own things).  She will send a text with the meeting spot and ETA.  We will meet up, watch her get married by a friend (with one of those $50 online officiant certificates), and then meet up for dinner in the park somewhere.  I think it's brilliant but my husband thinks we'll be banned for life (""They charge $50,000 for a wedding, they are not going to let her do it for free"").
