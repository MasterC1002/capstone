Would anyone be interested?	netbich	51	5	22	"I work for a print company and my job basically consists of fixing other people's bad artwork.  I've been in the print industry for many years and it never ceases to amaze me how many rookie mistakes people make when submitting art for print.  Let's put it this way, no matter how good Photoshop gets I will never be out of work due to lack of bad art. So I'm wondering if people on this sub-reddit would be interested in a list of common problems I run into. Rules of thumb for designing for print and why these rules are important if you want a good end result. If you're going to put forth the effort to make something that looks great on screen wouldn't it be great if it would print just as great?  If I get enough interest I'll post it up. 
Thanks.

I take care of the day to day maintenance on the website and also making sure we look sharp on social networks. I am also in charge of designs at work. I was hired to fill the Graphic Designer position. It isn't that horrible. 

However, today I walk into work and my boss is telling me that she doesn't want me designing stuff for her on her time anymore. She says that her friend told her about 99designs and how amazing it is. So she says that she wants me to do other stuff now because she is just going to have 99designs take care of everything she needs designed. Her main motivating factor is that she doesn't want to pay me to do all of the prep work for coming up with designs. 

For example, she had me design a logo for her company. It was my first assignment. I spent about eight solid hours working on it. I did about six hours at work and the rest at home. I was and still am very proud of the logo. So she brings this up. Remember when it took you two days to come up with a design for the logo? Well 99designs you just pay them and it all just pops up on the screen. You even get to choose from 18 finalists. 

Fuck you 99designs I hope you choke on your own vomit.

1350097679.0	11ee4a	As promised - Rules of thumb: Designing for print	netbich	51	10	17	"As I stated in my original post, I’ve worked in the print industry for many years and primarily fix other people’s bad artwork for a living.  I see certain recurring problems on a daily basis and thought this would be a good forum to help new (or not so new) designers avoid making the same costly mistakes.  I say costly because we charge you to fix your stuff. And assuming someone paid you to create it, they most likely won’t be hiring you again if we charge them more to fix it.  I am going to assume I’m talking to Graphic Design students or recent graduates new to the industry.  I’ve seen a few “self-taught” people that are good at designing for print, but they are rare. 


**File Format:**  Most art is sent to us electronically via email or through one of the file sharing sites. We get the occasional CD or flash drive. If you are emailing your file please do not name it “business card” or “CD cover” or whatever it is. You are not their only customer. We get hundreds of files a day and they all go to the same place until we get ready to set up your file. It sucks to have to sift through 20 files named “business card” and there’s a chance the wrong file may get used. Most places will give you an invoice number when you place the order.  Use that as the beginning of the file name or at least try to give it a unique name such as “yourname_business_card” 


 We accept and prefer high resolution TIF’S, JPEGS, PDF’s, EPS and AI files.  
We also accept native files such as InDesign or Quark (oh, and Corel draw but we hate those…) If you send these type of layout files you need to make sure you include all the fonts and images that are used in the layout. Both InDesign and Quark have a “package” feature that will gather them up and put them in one folder. Zip this folder.  In fact anytime you need to send multiple files zip them. It’s really annoying to have to download 20 individual files. Plus font files do not travel well if they’re not zipped.

 

We do NOT accept Word documents, Power Point slides or Publisher files.  If you use these you are a bad designer and you should feel bad.  

**“High resolution”** is considered 300 dpi at 100 % scale. If you send us a 2 inch logo and want it blown up to 10 inches your resolution drops to 60 dpi and will print like shit.  Vector files don’t have resolution issues and can be scaled to whatever you want. We love them. If you don’t know the difference between raster and vector, go back to school and this time pay attention.
Also, if you create something at 72 dpi it will always be 72 dpi. You can shrink it and the resolution will read as higher, but it will print fuzzy and pixelated. 
Always create your stuff at 300 dpi and at the final size of the product you are ordering. 
This being said, I realize it’s not always possible to provide something at 300 dpi. You may have found the perfect image and it’s only 150 dpi or lower.  Try printing it out at the size you want to use it. If it looks good to you, go ahead and use it in your design.  Depending on the print medium it may print just fine.  If you’re using it in a Photoshop file still make sure you create your layout file at 300 dpi and place the lower res image into this document. This way everything else you create/add will be 300 dpi. 


**Layout:** Create your document at the final size you want it to be PLUS bleed.  If you don’t know what bleed is, go back to school… and well you know. 
In other words, if you want to order something that is 8x10 create a document that is 8.25 x 10.25 – The extra quarter inch is for bleed. Bleed is the extra image we need so that when your product is cut down to size you won’t see white space along the sides.  All print related machinery has a shifting tolerance. Things will move around. If you don’t give us bleed we will create it by altering your file in various ways. Some printers won’t. They’ll print whatever they are given and if it has white space on the edges, oh well too bad for you. 

**Keep critical art elements at least .25 away from the edge of the die line** ( the die line is where your product will be cut ) This includes text, logos and anything else you absolutely do not want to be cut off. Again, some printers will not warn you about things that may be cropped off. 


**Fonts:** Fonts are the bane of my existence… Either they send a file that is missing fonts or they want us to add text using the same font that is in their logo (which is a flat Photoshop image or in curves.) Contrary to popular belief we cannot immediately identify every single font we see. Although after all these years I’m pretty good at it.  

There are some web sites that help identify fonts. 

http://www.identifont.com/  

and 

http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/ are two really good ones.


But just because we know what font it is doesn’t mean we have it available for use. 
When we tell people their file is missing fonts and/or images they get annoyed. “What are you talking about? I don’t get a missing font/image message when I open it!” Yeah, that’s because you have the files on your computer… duh. 
The best way to insure your fonts print exactly as you created them is to convert them to curves or outlines. This is an Illustrator feature. The downside to this is that we cannot make any text changes for you once they are converted to curves.  Photoshop does not generally give us font problems unless you want us to change your text. 


**PROOF YOUR OWN FILE** before sending it out so no changes will be needed. I’m shocked how many people apparently don’t know their phone numbers or web addresses. 
Spell check, grammar check etc. Print it out and read it. Looking at something on screen for days and weeks leaves us blind to silly mistakes. Printing it out triggers a different part of our brains and we see things we may have missed on screen. (That’s my theory and I’m sticking to it) Have a friend or co-worker proof it for you too. 


**Color:** All printers print in CMYK or spot colors (generally Pantone spot colors) Spot colors usually cost extra but you are more or less guaranteed to get the color you want. 
If you’re more comfortable designing in RGB feel free. But make sure you convert it to CMYK before you send it to us so you can see how it will really look. There are certain colors that simply cannot be printed using CMYK. That super bright blue and green you see on your monitor does not exist in 4 color process land. Unless you want to pay extra for Hexachrome inks and even those aren’t as bright. 
The RGB blues usually turn purple when converted and red gradients turn ugly brown.  Personally I would design it in CMYK from the start. But even doing this, you may not be seeing the true color of the final product. Few people calibrate their monitors on a regular basis. We do it once a week. The best way to know what your file will look like is to actually print it. Average household inkjet printers will not give you a true color print out, but you’ll have an idea.  If you send us at least something to match for color we will do our best to give you a “pleasing representation” of your art.  You can also get a calibrated color target printed or a surface proof. This usually costs extra. 
Blacks and ink levels: I’ve recently started seeing an annoying trend. People are using registration as black in their art. (100% of all 4 colors – cyan, magenta, yellow and black) This is a problem for printers because it causes whatever we are printing on to become over-saturated. Too much ink can cause appearance issues, such as muddy colors or ink puddling. Total ink density needs to be capped at 290%.  You can see what your ink totals are in Photoshop under the info tab
**Most printers have a “rich black” formula they prefer. Ask yours what they use. We use 45-35-35-100**



**Most of all have realistic expectations.** You can have the exact same file printed on different mediums (paper, fabric, plastic) and it will look different on every one of them.  That’s because the medium has color of its own and this affects the final product. 
I’ve also uploaded an [Art check list](http://i.imgur.com/wPjnG.jpg) we use for the TL;DR version of this post. I removed any company info if you’re wondering what the blank spaces are. We don’t print for the general public. 
I hope this was helpful. I probably forgot some things. Feel free to add to it.  If you have any print-related questions feel free to pm me. 

**EDIT** I knew I would forget some stuff... 

 Another common issue is people will send in black and white art and ask for a ""Forest Green"" or ""Sky Blue"" background with white imprint. These are not real colors in the print industry.  If you can't afford a pantone book, give us 4 color process values or a sample of something printed in the color you want.  

Also, we often get just a logo with no instructions regarding placement.  When this happens we center it on the product, and use our best judgement for sizing. If you want it small and in the lower right corner - you need to provide a layout with crop marks or a die line or at least written instructions.  We are not mind readers. "	t5_2qrct	True

360, circle, of course.

But this system is called the Xbox One... and since Microsoft has taken to a new design direction, with sharp, well defined edges and flat colors, it only seems right that the Xbox logo get an update with it.

It also lends itself to making their logo an ""X"" in a ""Box"", which makes sense for the most obvious of reasons.

* Never ever believe that you've made it. No matter how good you get you should always strive to be better because chances are there will always be someone better then you out there.
* Learn the tools of the trade really really well and I don't just mean photoshop. Illustrator and Indesign are mostly used for the foundation of any design work. Shortcuts will make your life easier!
* Don't take criticism and critique immaturely. They could be wrong they could be right, either way use it to your advantage and get better.
* Surround yourself with good design, artists, and join sites like behance or pinterest. The more you retain good design the more good design you dish out.
* When pricing a client like a friend or some kind of simple task especially if you're still in school or just out of school don't expect to make 1,000's of dollars. Do stuff for free, do it for cheap, because what's important right now is building your skill and portfolio.
* The most important experience you could ever have is a good internship if at all possible before you head out into the field for a job.
* Take inspiration, but do not copy.
* Read books, notice how they're designed and laid out.
* Design isn't easy because it's very detail oriented despite what most people think.
* You don't have to go to school to become a great designer. There are millions of books and online tutorials to check out.
* Just because you're talented doesn't mean you're skilled. That takes time and effort. Don't get by on just talent.
* Understand color and color theory.
* You will eventually become obsessed with typography, if not then you should.
* Design does not mean color and type or how things are laid out. Design means to plan or to solve a problem. Always start your design process with sketches and brainstorming before you even touch the computer.
* Nobody will hire you if you're lazy and have an arrogant attitude about your work even if you have the best work out of everyone who's applied. They'll pick the guy behind you because his attitude is awesome and can mold well with the team.
* Print design is awesome, but web design and mobile UI are in very high demand and show no signs of slowing down. If you want to be a print designer know some web design as well. You'll be more valuable.
* Always spark creativity by doing art in other mediums like painting, drawing, sketching, photography etc. 
* Sometimes the best effects are done by hand and not digitally. Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.
* Hang out with other friends who are designers to get feedback and share ideas. Your work will improve and you'll inspire each other.
* Last but not least, you do not need a masters in design to have a good job!! What is most important is your portfolio and the presentation of your work.

Thanks, hope I helped someone :)

I could really use some help. I was hired by a local college to be an instructor for a 5-day digital art summer camp. I teach five three-hour-long courses to kids from 9-12. I was SO excited to spread the passion of graphic design on to these kids.

My issue is, the class takes place in a college computer lab, and the computers have NO image editing software, no adobe suite, not even GIMP. The computers have the highest security measures, and require the computer admin to change any of them. The admin is gone for the summer, so no one knows how to change any of these settings.

Today was the first day and we just went on a lot of websites that have flash-based art creators/generators. This was ok for one day, but I'm quite sure that they would be tired of it tomorrow, and I also believe I've just about exhausted the supply of the good sites like this.

If you were in my situation, what would you do to teach these kids?
I'm somewhat at a loss, and I really don't want to dissappoint them, because a lot of the kids are really excited about this.

1373911133.0	1icqeb	When bad design is actually good design	daxtr	16	2	12	"Hi there, /r/graphicdesign!

Earlier today I was visiting a nursing home and as I walked down one of the corridors I saw a lot of notes/papers. Some handwritten and the rest of them typed out with Comic Sans. At first I cringed a bit, but then it got me thinking. 

I think most people would agree that Comic Sans is inherently a pretty bad font, it is used way too much and in every possible setting except the one place it should be used in: comic books. Still people use it. Why? It being a system font probably has to do with it, but I also think the fact that it is slightly less ""serious"" than the other default fonts helps. It's perfect for writing those passive-agressive-but-not-really-that-agressive notes we all love and hate.

So what's my point? Is Comic Sans a decent font? Is its use in a serious setting justified? Was it correct for this context (the nursing home)? No. But what I remember thinking was how the silly, stupid, wonky letters helped humanize an otherwise very controlled and sterile setting. It took my mind off of the sad truth that many of the inhabitants of this place are there to grow old and forgetful and ultimately to die. It reminded me that the staff is more concerned with looking after the people who live there than they are with completely pleasing the control freaks of the design community.

So I thought I would post those thoughts here. Because it struck me that perhaps sometimes bad design can actually be good design. When perfection isn't achieved but humanity slips through the cracks and the perfect but apathetic face of bureaucracy fades away to show something much uglier but also much more true and beautiful.

So for the sake of discussing this topic: When do you think bad design, or the lack of it, can actually be good design? Are there any specific moments you can think of? Or is the lack of control never a good thing and are there ways to make things more ""human"" other than through superficial means like style?

I hope you'll want to contribute, I think this could make for an interesting topic of discussion!"	t5_2qrct	True

It's powerful and ubiquitous and prestigious. However, I am baffled at how certain features are absent or difficult to use by default. (Note: I am still using CS5 - forgive me if these issues have been resolved in CS6).

My issues:

* AI's default when resizing an object is not proportional. You need to shift+click to scale proportionally. How often do you really want to stretch and distort versus resize proportionally? Wouldn't it make more sense for the default to be proportional scaling?
* Many features (Blob Brush, for example) default to Grayscale rather than CMYK or even RGB. Why? I'm guessing not many people work in grayscale mode exclusively.
* There is, as far as I know, still no Ungroup All feature. Depending on how complex an object is, you may have to click Ungroup many, many times to separate all the elements.
* The alignment tools are hopelessly clumsy. Want to align one object to another? Okay: Click object one. Shift+click object two. Click object two to make it the Key Object. Open the Alignment panel and click the appropriate alignment option. Why bother with Key Objects? Many other programs make alignment much simple by having the first object clicked automatically be the ""key object"", aligning objects clicked afterward to that first object.
* The Pathfinder tools are mind-bogglingly frustrating. If you, for example, trim one complex compound path with another object, the compound path will be released and then grouped. Why not leave it as a compound path?
* You're able to Lock objects, but the only option for Unlocking is ""Unlock All"". What if you have 20 locked objects and only want to unlock a couple of them?

I could go on and on. Perhaps some of you will chastise me and tell me I don't know how to use Illustrator. However, I'm guessing some of you share my belief that the industry standard vector art program could use some simple and intuitive tweaks when it comes to its interface."	t5_2qrct	True

However, today he posted a bunch of pictures of himself with his girlfriend shot by a professional photographer. I took one of the photos ([original](http://craftedpixelstudios.com/kelleychaning/h4d25d516#h4d25d516)) and 'shopped it to be inside a gross looking bathroom [(here)](http://i.imgur.com/yyyiK.jpg) and then posted it to his Facebook wall.

A few minutes later he deleted and messaged me saying: ""Hey you can't do that. Sorry I had to delete it, but those are professional photos copyrighted by Scott. Kelley and I can't even edit them. ... he can sue you for that. He has all the copyrights on those."" Apparently another friend had made a collage out of some of the pictures and the photographer warned them to delete it because that was illegal.

My question is this: Can I actually be sued for this?

The only thing I'm doing with the picture is posting it on Facebook. The picture in question, I got from my friend's personal Facebook account (not the photographer's). It had no indication of copyright (watermark, etc.). I'm not sure how exactly copyrights work.

Mark, my co-host, is very funny and the podcast gets very raunchy at times. It's definitely not one of those dry, boring ""how-to"" design podcasts. We have a lot of fun and the response so far has been great. So, check it out.

You might want to skip the first 15 minutes of the first episode though - it's pretty bad but the production quality has steadily improved as the show has progressed.

I have never been paid as a graphic designer before, and therefore I have NO IDEA what to charge. I know its tacky to throw out numbers, but I really need advice. It sounds like she's going to have a lot of different work she wants done for her (her words were ""if this relationship proves to be productive, I will be giving you jobs here and there for years to come."") I don't want to overcharge and have her go to someone else, but I also don't want to work with her for years and be getting underpaid. 

Some of the work she mentioned were: 

-a couple of commercial posters to be posted on railroads with instructions for waste management

-a newsletter she needs designed and managed

-a textbook she has written, but she needs it laid out, and she needs diagrams illustrated

-a small website for which she would need front-end design
 
Clearly, she feels I have the talent to do what she needs, so what do I ask for?

I know its really tacky to ask for numbers, but I just have no idea, and I desperately need the money. I'm transferring to a university in a new city and currently have no job. Maybe you can PM me if you don't feel comfortable saying a number publicly?

I started with a pieced-together Google map and traced over the main roads and bodies of water and then typed in all the road names along the paths of roads; I included icons for landmarks and will eventually include info in the legend about each landmark and of course there will be lots of photos and info on the backside.
After just drawing the main map itself, looking up addresses for landmarks and pin-pointing them on the map with custom icons, I've already spent 11 hours. Is that a ridiculous amount of time or what?
(I don't think the rest of the job will take quite as long, that was pretty much the bulk of it.) How long would it take you?

TL; DR - How long does it take you to design a: poster, brochure, logo, or website? If you do go slower, do you reduce your hourly rate?"	t5_2qrct	True

Previous positions were as the lone graphic designer for people that were not design literate, so this position is my first step into the art firm world. Being amongst so many other designers and firm people has been great, not to mention the company itself is fantastic.

I had never heard of production artists before this position, though I'm highly adapt at it. I don't need the creative energy of being lead design, not my thing I guess, but the impression I've gotten over time is that production/implementation is not valued as high because it's not the ideal creation base that designers are.

So, I wanted to get this community's thoughts on production and production artists. How do you feel about it? Not a permanent career decision? Or is it just fine? Undervalued? "	t5_2qrct	True

I have a job at a print shop where I do all of the designing and file prep for print.

Mind you it has been a pretty good beginners job, and I have learned a ton, but it seems pretty limited for the future.

I'm wondering how you self employed designers got started. I'm sure you didn't start with a full client list. How do you build it up? I don't do any designing other than at work right now, mostly because I have no idea where to start.

Also, I have a concern: I'm the only graphic designer for the entire department, so I'm a little worried they may not have a frame of reference for how long this will take to build the way they told me they want it; previous years it's been a pretty bland text-only document, and this year they really want to jazz it up with lots of images, charts, etc. They're giving me pretty much free reign with layout and design, which is awesome. The problem is, they want it done by December 3rd, and when I asked for the copy yesterday so I could dive in...well, there is no copy yet. Just basically a Table of Contents.

**I'd be glad to help you with another map, but since we've already finalized this design &amp; adding a map with detail like that is going to mean I have to make it if we want it to look good, I'm going to have to bill you at $x per hour, and I estimate this will take about 1 hour. Is that agreeable?  Also, you guys might want to take a look and see if there are any other little changes you want made &amp; make a list, so that we can knock this out quicker &amp; save some time &amp; money.** 

I'm completely freelance.

I did a brochure for a client about a month ago.  They turned out to be pretty damn difficult.  Every time I would make some piddlin' change, they'd almost immediately email me back about some other piddlin' change.  This went on for three weeks...for a brochure...(you know, normal stuff)

I finally got it done and ready for print to their satisfaction.  About a month after I get payment, I always email my clients and make sure everything's ok.

Well SURPRISE SURPRISE...with these people, it wasn't.  So, there was one digit off on one occurrence of the phone number.  I changed it &amp; didn't mind, since it was an easy fix and clearly an oversight.  They SURPRISE SURPRISE....EMAIL BACK AGAIN, saying they want a different map.

At this point, I've already been paid, and while the money was worth the hours, it's not really worth doing any more.  

I don't mind changing their map, but I think I'm going to email back saying ""I'd be happy to change your map, but since we've already finalized this design, I'm going to have to bill you at $x per hour, and I estimate this will take about 1 hour.  Is that agreeable?""

1360712721.0	18eqrj	Looking to launch a weekly youtube series on design.	they0da	8	0	8	"Hey all fellow designers. As the title states, I'm interested in creating a series of design videos on youtube. 

As I see it now, there are a TON of speed art videos (some good, mostly meh) and a lot of art showcasings. What I noticed was the lack of good, fun, and easy to understand design education videos. This is where I'd like to make my entry.

I'm currently a sophomore enrolled in Visual Communication Design but have been designing in total for about 5 years now (damn I feel old saying that). Because of this I have a nice mix of self taught and disciplined design principles flowing through my work. Like most of you, I started out self taught, I developed my own style, and I did things MY way. Getting to college however proved to be a lot different than I imagined. Once I got into some higher level courses, I dealt with a ton of criticism, so much so that it felt like design bootcamp. For many of us this was a complete shock. When I was a freshman, my entire class consisted of about 200 people. Now, as a Sophomore, that's down to about 100.

My reasoning for creating these videos is to ease the transition between going from a completely self taught designer to becoming a formally educated designer. In my videos, I would do a range of tutorials ranging from drawing techniques, color theory, design principles (this would probably take about 5-10 vids to explain of it), tutorials with adobe programs like photoshop and illustrator, and I would definitely like to showcase other designer's work! 

So my question to the graphic designers of reddit. Would you have any interest in this? As of now, I'm pretty devoted to coursework but there's no reason why I couldn't crank out 1 to 2 videos a week. Let me know what you all think! I appreciate it.

**EDIT:** From all the feedback, I'm definitely going to launch this series. If this got downvoted into oblivion, well that would have been the end of it. But as long as there are people that would benefit from this, I'm willing to help. Thanks for the response everyone!

**EDIT #2:** Decided post the youtube channel link. I have no videos as of now but feel free to subcribe.  http://www.youtube.com/user/ptrklwdn"	t5_2qrct	True

not an iMac was stirring—not even an iPad.  
Design comps were hung on the wall for critique,  
in a tireless search for creative mystique.  

With students at last reunited with family,  
and wishing for gifts of hardware &amp; eye-candy.  
Staff at their studios, and faculty at home,  
the only one left here is me, all alone.  

I'm turning out lights and locking up rooms,  
when an ominous ""ding"" sounds in the gloom.  
The ill-boding chime of a notification—  
just as i'm leaving for #ChristmasVacation!  

It might not mean much to a casual observer,  
but the #GDDProgram just lost it's type-server.  
The fonts are offline—Designers, beware!  
I sprang from my @hermanmiller #AeronChair.  

But what might have caused the server to crash?

to keep all our budding typographers sated?  

On Bembo! on Garamond! Baskerville and Caslon!

With that problem solved and naught left to do,

And just when I think I can finally go—  
there's a crash and a bang and a loud ""Ho, Ho, Ho"".  

It had to be #Santa, but something looked… wrong.  
He was dressed all in orange, but I played along.  
""Please help me,"" he said, ""It's all such a mess—  
my graphic designer spec'd the wrong PMS.""  

I reached for my @Pantone swatch book for a fix.  
""Here you go, Santa, it's red 186.  
And everyone knows you can't take the the skies,  
with your 'Seasons Greetings' at 72 DPI.""  

""What's more, your letter-spacing's quite concerning.  
I'll go right ahead and tighten that kerning.  
Your Christmas list shouldn't be centre aligned—  
no wonder you're checking it so many times.""  

""Those sleigh-wrap graphics look really absurd—  
were they created in Microsoft Word?  
Say what you will about 'best laid plans'  
'til someone is naughty with #ComicSans.""  

""So what? Your elf's nephew took one course online.  
Doesn't mean he can handle your full redesign.  
Let #GDD make you a true branding guide,  
to help you approach each and every Yuletide.""  

Ready at last, as he headed for the door,  
he said, ""Here's something nice from the @AppleStore.""  
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team sent a tweet.  
Yes, even St. Nicholas uses @Hootsuite.  

""You've helped me to see that my level of 'Ho-Ho'

1350787503.0	11tsw6	Please Critique. Signifier for a games dev studio	majors	6	0	5	"http://i.imgur.com/swQ9h.png

The idea is to have a graphic signifier that could be used individually and also used together with the name of the company - **skycycle studios**

I wanted to have a story behind the visual that is not in-your-face obvious. 

The circle defines the visual and represents the **sky**. The inner shape is an ""S"" on its side but the shape can also be perceived as infinity representing the **cycle** part.

The broken cycle and contrast between 90 degree angles and a full circle is an intentional conflict to give it a reference to the dramatic subject which is **sky** and **space**   

And last but not least, this is my studio and I'm from Latvia. [This](http://lv.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Att%C4%93ls:Zalksha_ziime.svg&amp;page=1) is an ancient Latvian symbol called The Sign of Adler. It represents wisdom, curiosity and many other things.  

I still haven't properly thought out the wording of rationale but these are the initial thoughts. I kind of like what I've got but I'm not completely convinced if I've cracked it. 

Any thoughts are very welcome. Thanks!

I have used a standard license agreement in the past but I honestly would like to have someone who works in the legal industry provide me with something that I can feel a little bit more comfortable using.  I don't want to hire a straight up lawyer exactly, mainly because the cost would outweigh the benefit I think. 

The license agreement I have now establishes that I own the image but the client is free to use and publish as they wish.  In cases where it is used on a product for sale, I have stipulated that a new agreement must be made for royalty sharing (*so this is one of the first things I need*).  The second thing I need is some assurance that my license agreement is sound.  Or perhaps it just needs to be scrapped and you can craft me one that works for what I need.

I feel like the font used (Arial) for the ""Log"" portion of the logo is... off. But I can't get a sense of what type of font I would use in this case. Maybe something can also be done to make the ""D"" at the end look better, but I am not sure what. 


The rationale behind the book with the orange quill is to represent a logbook, but also serve as the ""M"" in the title ""LogMD"" (if that makes sense). I am not really a creative person, however this is my attempt at being ""artistic"" as I kind of like how some logos incorporate an image into the company/product title. I chose a different colour for the quill as I felt it didn't look as good monochrome. I want it to remain simple and clean as it is what best suits the site design that the logo will reside on.

My question is, how can I play up the fact that I didn't major in graphic design? How important is it really to have a degree in it? A lot of people in the arts, whether it's design, music production, film, always complain that going to school for arts-based subjects are a waste because you can't be taught to have ""taste"" or vision.

At 18 I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and so I opted for a degree in something interesting without thinking about career options. I regret this now. At the moment I'm £25,000 in debt with student loans and so another degree isn't a viable option for me financially. Over the last couple of years I've come to the decision that I would like to work in the creative industry, specifically in Graphic Design. This is not a decision I've made overnight. 

The trouble is, where the hell do I start? I'm going to have to teach myself everything in my spare time and really knuckle down, which I am prepared to do. I also realise that this might take me a while, so I'm giving myself until I'm 30 to improve and develop to a point whereby I might be able to sustain a career as a creative. Is that a realistic goal?

So where do I start? What goals should I set myself? What should I learn? I need resources. There are so many that it's overwhelming trying to choose what to learn from. Are there any cheap/free courses I can do online? I love to draw, and I love design. I just don't know where to start really. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I've posted here before and you guys were extremely helpful. This time I need some help from someone much more knowledgeable and design-savvy than me. I know it's a huge request but I need help designing some logos. If this isn't the right place for this post then I'm very sorry.

I am a pastor at a church and I'm hoping to re-design some logos for our different ministries. I've worked up a few little tidbits with no real software so they're just ideas drawn up ( http://imgur.com/a/sz4E3 ). I really like minimalist style and that's what I'd hope these to be.

The ministries I'm hoping to provide logos for are the Kids ministry (FBC Kids), our jr. high ministry (OverFlow), and our high school youth group (2:42). The 2:42 group is already centered around the graphic of a tree. It doesn't have to be the exact tree but any tree with roots visible would work. All I really need is the logo itself so any background graphics are unnecessary since I'll probably just be putting up the logo on all sorts of random things and places.

Any help would be hugely appreciated and like I said before, if there's a more suitable sub for this, please let me know.

1347948702.0	102g1g	I love graphic design, but I can't draw.	WenchStench	7	2	12	"Occasional lurker here. Greetings.

I am currently a journalism and international studies double major. Being involved with a school newspaper for the past four years, I spent many hours designing pages on deadline- working with photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator. I won several state and national awards for layout design, and grew to love the process of creating. I'm an amateur photographer as well.

Layout examples: http://imgur.com/a/UCa2s#3

(My school newspaper in high school was called ""The Talon."" These are just a couple examples of what I happened to have on me at the time.)

But here's the problem. On paper, I am a terrible artist. I cannot draw, paint, sculpt or anything. I am definitely a creative left brainer, but my outlet of choice is usually writing. I struggle with stick figures . . . that's how bad I am.

That brings me to where I am today. I really do love journalism, but I would be lying if I said I hadn't considered switching majors or at least throwing a graphic design minor in the mix.

Here's where you lovely people come in. I have zero graphic design mentors, and am entirely self taught. I was hoping I could bounce some questions off you. 

1) Is knowing how to draw essential to the vocation of Graphic Design? I'm not a visual artist in any other area, but I've found success on a computer. Is it enough?

2) Is a minor sufficient, or do most designers strive for a higher degree?

3) What's the job market like right now? I'm sure it's better than journalism, but could a guy get a steady job with enough talent and hard work? Also, what's the state of freelance GD?

I tried to keep it concise. Sorry for being the annoying freshman looking for advice, but anything you can throw me would be a huge help!

Much love, Reddit

However, being a freelance writer myself, I know how much it SUCKS to not get paid, or worse, underpaid for work you've put your heart and soul into.


If you can give me an estimate on how long it would take, I will pay over and above what I understand are typical hourly rates ($25-30/hr?)
I will pay 50% of that up-front (via paypal if you prefer).


Again, I'm sorry for being such a hack with this. If you're patient enough to work with me on understanding your pay requirements, I will pay you well. As much as this helps me, it's also helping my father, for whom the brewery is sort of named after.

I've pretty experienced in Photoshop, but I've never created a product mockup before. They don't seem to be asking for too much, but I had a few questions for those of you who have done something similar before.

* Are there any special considerations when designing for a product mockup? They've given me the dimensions for the product. I was thinking of just designing the individual sides on different documents (obviously at 300dpi, CMYK, etc.)
* Should I purchase a pre-made product template to put my design on? Something like [this](http://graphicriver.net/item/notro-multipurpose-box-template/2502023).
* What should I charge? I've never done something like this so I'm not sure what I should charge, especially since I'm not a well-known designer or anything like that.

I taught myself how to use photoshop and have been a MacGuyver kinda designer since my freshman year of high school; designing logos for my/other bands, t-shirt designs, album art, flyers, and sometimes basic web design (VERY basic). I've done some work here and there for a little cash on the side. Now I really want to do this professionally since it's something that I enjoy very much and I strongly believe that it's better to have a change of mind now at 22, than to have one later down the line when I'm 40 and can't do anything about it. 

As you can see from my [""portfolio of sorts""](https://www.facebook.com/RoundhouseGraphics/photos_stream), I don't have any real formal training. I have ideas and I somehow transfer them through photo manipulation and filters. I very rarely draw anything. I get a lot of praise, but I feel hesitant to try and get a job in the field without actually knowing how to draw traditionally or even how to use Illustrator or any program other than Photoshop. 

So my question is what would I need to do to go through with this shift in careers? What would be a logical first step? 

Thanks,
-Kris"	t5_2qrct	True

* What website should I use to sell the shirts?
* If you ignore profit, about how much money does it cost per shirt to sell them online?
* What kind of designs do you think sell the best for t-shirts (movie themed, funny, abstract, etc.)
* Is there a minimum age to sell t-shirts online? I am under 18.

I'd love any and all feedback on this portfolio design. It's older, and I'm looking for ideas of how to update and improve it. 

If you could, answer these questions: 

- Based on my portfolio, how many years experienced would you guess I have as a Graphic Designer?
- Could you assign an overall letter grade to my portfolio (considering both the portfolio design itself, and the work)? 
- Should I scrap this portfolio design and start over from scratch, or is it worth revising and improving? 
- Is any of my work so unprofessional as to be out of place in my portfolio? Are there specific pieces or projects you find embarrassingly bad and you feel just need to be excluded?

There's a ton of technical jargon on the poster, so don't worry about the text.  I'm specifically interested in the bar at the bottom that represents the different pieces of the protein sequence.  Does this work?  

Also I'm not sure table 1 is really clear, so would be interested in suggestions for other ways to represent this information, or improve it.

The ELI5 version of what the poster is about is: The virus that causes the flu has a mechanism to inject itself into your cells and make you sick.  That mechanism is called the ""fusogenic transition of hemagglutinin"".  Hemagglutinin is a protein (abbreviated HA), and comes in a variety of forms.  When you hear about a H1N1 flu, the H1 refers to the type of hemagglutinin.  We took an antibody (also a protein) that is known to bind to one type of HA, (H3) and tried to mutate it so that it would also bind to different type, H10.  However, this was complicated by the fact that we didn't know the three dimensional structure of the H10 sequence, so we had to determine that by a method called ""homology modeling"" first.  Once we had the three dimensional structure, we could compare that to the known structure of the H3 that is known to bind to the antibody.  By doing that, then we knew exactly which parts (""residues"") of the antibody protein we would need to change to make it bind to our H10.  Once we made the changes, we gave the antibody a good shake (""energy minimized"") to make sure that the changes we made were realistic.  At the end of the day, we made a lot of changes to the antibody, but still have places where our H10 collides with the antibody (""clashes"").  This means the antibody is physically not going to stick to  the H10 the way it does to the H3, so it probably won't work as we hoped.  Table 1 summarizes the changes that we made to the antibody and whether they were realistic (""preserved after energy minimization"").  

tl;dr: You have two balls of playdoh that are mushed together.  Took one ball and tried to mush it together with a third ball, with the hope of preventing the flu.  Didn't quite work.

Any suggestions you have on how I could improve the graphical aspects of the poster would be appreciated."	t5_2qrct	True

I'm a journalist. I went to school for journalism and I have a job that pays me every day to write stories for a newspaper.

However, I did take a couple graphic design clases in college where we played around with photoshop, illustrator, indesign and the like. I found I rather enjoyed them so I went out and bought CS4 and I've been piddling with them ever since, making cool resumes for my friends and designing random stuff like my newspaper's press badges.

Recently, though, more people have started asking me to design logos for their companies or redesign the mast head for their newspaper. For instance, I had a local school district ask me to design a new logo for one of their elementary schools. It's going to be on their website, their facebook, their stationary, t-shirts, everything. They had a very basic idea of what they wanted and I worked with them a good deal to make sure they liked the final product.

This is all awesome because these people actually want to PAY me to do something I enjoy doing in my spare time. My problem is that I have no idea what's a reasonable amount for which to ask. I asked a friend of mine who does GD work in Austin how much he charges for stuff like this and he said his lower end is $500-600.

I'd love to hear comments and suggestions, and I'd love to compare it to what you're running, and how it performs.

     - Roland VP540 Printer
     -VersaWorks printing software
     - NPI 1005 EC vinyl material
     - several dozen feet of car wrap to print


**Here's the problem:**

     - Every time we print, the print samples come out looking as if the ink wasn't set down correctly. 
For lack of better wording, my coworker described the effect 
""as if someone had dabbed the vinyl with a napkin and picked up ink"". 
Furthermore the Avery logo on the back of the vinyl is somehow bleeding through or being imprinted onto the front of the vinyl.


**What we've tried:**

     - Different print profiles (GCVP, PWV, CWVR, PGVR).
     - Scaled up the print to full size in case printing a smaller size was      the problem.
     - rolling out a couple of feet of the vinyl and printing in case the edge had somehow become ruined.
 

Nothing seems to work and we're stumped. Some of the guys I'm working under have years of experience but even they don't know what to make of it, though to be fair none of us have done a car wrap of this magnitude (whole van) before.

.  
Obviously, you need to be comfortable are you working with R or X rated material.  I'm feel pretty comfortable that a Redditor will be prepared for that.  
.  
I am contemplating trying to write dirty novels for Amazon Kindle.   There is, apparently, quite a little growing sub-genre there.   I don't understand why anyone with an internet connection pays for porn, but am thinking, it can't be that hard to write (I've done other wriitng) and they may as well pay me.   
.  
That said, a good sexy cover is essential, and I don't have the skills for that.   So I am looking for a graphic designer who is not going to be weirded out by the whole topic, who can make a sexy cover to my specs.   This will probably involve buying the use of a a stock photo from somewhere on a royalty-free basis.   Naturally, I would be paying for that, or if you prefer, you could roll it in as an expense, but while I might be okay picking through a small selection, I am hoping my designer would be able to steer me to the right one.  
.  
You're not expected to read whatever I can come up with.   I'd provide the title, and author name (it wouldn't be my own - shocker!)   
.  
I don't expect this work should take a great deal of time.  It doesn't have to be immaculate (quite the contrary), it just needs to be eye-grabbing.   I am prepared to pay either by the piece, or by the hour.  I know the sidebar wants us to list a budget, but I am hesitant to do so without first discussing the work, the time-frame and what I can expect to pay for the use of a photograph.  
.  
Here is a recent article on Amazon's recommendations for the covers: http://kevinomclaughlin.com/2012/04/17/amazon-updates-kdp-ebook-cover-recommendations/  (links to more specific details here: https://kdp.amazon.com/self-publishing/help?topicId=A2J0TRG6OPX0VM)

EDIT:  I see here: http://www.reddit.com/r/GraphicDesign/comments/t32d2/apologies_to_recent_submitters_the_spam_filter/ 
 that listing one's budget is pretty important to this sub-reddit, so I am just going to take a wild stab and say that I hope to pay $25-$40 per cover, not including the cost of licensing the photograph.  Please someone feel free to tell me if my expectations are way off here.   FYI, a kindle book such as this would sell for $1-3, and so it will take a while before the cover is paid for.

Advice would be greatly appreciated!


edit: 
Thanks everyone for your help! It's been a looong weekend full of illustrator and eclipse but I'm liking the results so far. Here's the [redesigned interface](http://i.imgur.com/NMi8EAo.png).

* I changed all of the lines to a consistent solid line of about the same weight. 
* I removed the gradients and made the colors more solid.
* I made the hex pattern in the background smaller
* I found a couple new fonts to use that are for commercial use on android.
* I centered the status bar elements and made them a bit smaller. 

New concerns:

* The particle effect that I added to the sprites that are just about to blow up are washing out the sprite. I'm going to need to play around with that a little more.

I'm sticking to my guns on the colors. Since the interface is on a screen that is about 4"" wide, I want the colors to be clear as possible. Whenever I tried using colors that were a bit darker, it just didn't look right. It also clarifies which circle sprite is supposed to go to which goal area.  "	t5_2qrct	True

I am in need of some design services and I hope that you are the people who can help me. If not, can you point me in the right direction?

[My current site] (http://smallbiznerd.com/) is a theme I bought from theme forest.   I have been putting off the site for a few weeks and I would like to have something I can start directing customers to within the next two weeks.

My company is The Small Biz Nerd, I do small business management consulting for micro-medium sized businesses with an emphasis and process improvement and business intelligence.  The kameleon logo is the name of the theme and it needs to go.  

If you are looking at the homepage, I would like the top-left Kameleon logo to be replaced with something that says ""Small Biz Nerd"".  There is some room for creativity but I do want it to be kept in line with the rest of the page. 

If possible, I would also like the main image to be replaced to something more inline with the services I offer.  Anything data analysis or BI related would be cool.    

Examples: just something to demonstrate that I am here to help my clients ""bring it all together"".

[example2:]  (http://www.computernetworksit.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/business-intelligence1.gif)



Budget:   I would like to keep it below $150 payable by paypal or BTC if you'd prefer.  I don't have a lot to spend here and I know that the second part is probably going to be the most time intensive so I am not going to be unreasonable.   Basically whatever I can get for $150 I will be happy with. (I know that will probably only get me a few hours of work)

The other option is, if you can turn the larger image into the logo I can use that as a landing page for my other projects too and then I can worry about the 'Kameleon' some other way.

Let me know what else you need or if there is a better way to do this.

edit:   Thank you all very much for your time and ideas.   i am just getting done with  work and I wanted to let you know I really like a lot of what you have contributed but I am not 100% attached to any of them.   I would like to make a choice tomorrow so I am very much open to new ideas.  I noted my thoughts on each of the submissions so feel free to check it out.

edit2:  Thank you guys so much!   You have been very helpful and I have to say working with you all has been actually quite pleasant!

Searching the internet seemed pretty fruitless. /r/DIY didn't seem appropriate, since this is more of a design problem. 

I really love traditional wood-handled rubber stamps. I see that a lot of stationary designers offer the option to their clients. Are these designers just sending their designs off to stampmakers and then charging more than it costs them? If so - has anyone done this before or know of a good site to go to for this? Or is it possible to buy your own stamp making machine? (Unlikely, but that would be awesome.)

I place Shape A on top of the other two shapes, click Cmd+7, and all of a sudden, the green rectangle has become a clipping mask with no fill or stroke. Why would Adobe assume that you want your clipping shape to lose its attributes? Then, when I go to re-fill my rectangle in this example, it changes the colors of the contents of the mask, as well.

I'm a student who, as part of a program, takes a lot of live work. Most of it was low-to-no pay stuff like designing a new logo for my school or designing a cover for some tech conference's booklet. I have a ton of experience for a designer my age and an opportunity has come for me to work on a real project that could be a very exciting piece for my portfolio. 

The work is with a local corner store. The owner wants a new logo and possibly even a new sign. This is an extremely exciting opportunity for me. I understand that I could probably sift through Google search results and figure it out for myself, but I want the opinions of professionals.

My question stands. I'm a student designer who is designing a logo/sign. What are the average rates for this kind of thing, and what should my rates be?"	t5_2qrct	True

1340676213.0	vlugz	Noob questions about graphic design/digital media...	Ataraxiia	4	1	9	"So I have always been involved with creative stuff like painting, drawing, designing, photography, stuff like that. A while back, like maybe when I was 15 I used to mess around with making posters and stuff for events. They were incredibly shit, and even with my digital art I NEVER used layers and used some cheap version of Photoshop. Just last year I started using layers for the sketchbook pro app for the Ipad. 

I am trying my hardest to get into the bachelor program for digital media at Stockholm University or Hyper Island, but that may take a while because I am having some issues with translating my grades and all. 

Basically, in the meantime while I figure my school situation out, would it help to offer to do ads, posters, flyers, website banner, or stuff like that for free for my friends once I learn the basic of Photoshop? 

I don't think it will take long for me to figure it out, and it will be a hell of a lot easier now that I finally figured out how layers work. I also have A LOT of free time. 

I have a lot of friends who throw parties/raves/shows and might need posters and such and other friends who have small business and whatnot and I was just wondering if I should offer to make stuff for them for free, since I am just starting up. 

I also forgot to add as of now, the only tool I have is my Ipad that I got as a gift. Gunna try get my hands on Photoshop or whatever else I might need as soon as possible. Also trying to save up for a drawing tablet. "	t5_2qrct	True

I've recently been reading books on layout design and designing good geometric shapes.  The reason this post exists is to make sure that my mind is connecting concepts in the right way.  This is a cool community that I'm glad exists and I'm a part of.

So I was looking at poster designs and advertisements yesterday, which isn't an unusual thing for me (i'm sure everyone on this board loves looking at advertisement boards) and it don-donned me: most of these layouts are very similar to each other, its just the graphics that are the variables.  (Side note: these ads were in my local coffee shop and they were mostly music show times and art festival announcements)

So I said to myself ""Oh...  Maybe all these designers are using the same sort of template to base all these layouts off of, and the tricky part comes from creating the actual graphics.""  Like there might exist the ideal music poster layouts, or the fashion advertisement layouts, etc.  It led me to want to look up these templates for poster designs and copy them, just to get a feel for how they work.   Mind you, this would be on my own, and I'm not doing it for a client.

Hello, I didn't design this, but I'm curious to hear what other designers think about it. I think the logo is awkward; there's not enough contrast between the silver ""D"" and silver star and the drop-shadow on the ""D"" doesn't look right. However, I like the uniforms overall.

For example, let's say Arcade Fire is coming to my town. My plan to get my name noticed is to make posters for the event that I will hand out in the parking lot to people for free as ""memorabilia"". On the posters I plan to put my website and hopefully gain clients. They are just simple posters with the name of the Band(s), Venue, city and date.

My question is: Is this a good LEGAL idea?
The set rules I have for myself are: 

* All my posters will be free
* I will hand them out after the concert so I don't take away revenue away from the merch tables.
* Everything on the poster will be illustrated or the photography will be mine so I don't use images that might get me in trouble like band labels ect.
* I won't make many posters (15 maybe?) so I don't go bankrupt

The predominant style was to depict a real [Cloisonné](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloisonné) amulet or brooch as a drawing.

I could use any feedback regarding any of this but more specifically the colours.

Also, context: the idea is quite simple. An app and website where you can track your time (e.g. for freelancers and such) with graphs and all that! I Split the outer ring of the stopwatch as a way of representing that you can track multiple things (hence why the different shades).

I would appreciate all your feedback/critique on my business card concept.

It is for photo editing/restoration/colorization.

One side will just have my name, url, phone number, email. Not too worried about that side, and I don't want to make it anymore complicated than the basic info. For the other side however, I would like to make it a little more visually appealing--and hopefully visually descriptive. I'm thinking of placing something like one of these on the reverse side: [Logo 1](http://i.imgur.com/ALMuOOv.jpg) and [Logo 2](http://i.imgur.com/sIOlBRD.jpg). 

I'll be using a nicely textured cardstock, probably with 2 or 3 embossed lines around the edges. The purpose of the image is to slightly discolor the cardstock and make it look wrinkled on one half.

Will that just end up looking tacky once it's printed out?

I don't know much about Graphic Design, or how things work in this culture.  I'm looking for someone to do ""sprite"" images for a simple computer game that I'm working on in my free time.

So, what are your ""dos"" and ""don'ts"" for looking for a computer artist?  What do you look for, what should I make clear, and what are reasonable expectations of the person I end up working with?  What's a reasonable price to pay someone for one-off work like this?"	t5_2qrct	True

Being their art teacher, I guess that falls on me to lead them through the process, but I have NO idea where to start.

I'm looking to get a monitor that is relatively color accurate and was leaning toward this one:

Asus PA246Q  - 98%(Adobe RGB), 100%(sRGB), 102%(NTSC), 1073.7M (10bit) Colors.
It's an IPS monitor with a 10-bit panel.  It covers a lot more of the color gamut than your average monitor.

Now here's the problem:  I recently learned that OSX does not yet support 10 bits per channel output, even on displayport.  This means I am effectively sending an 8bit signal to the monitor.  

1)  I would like to get some information on how this 8bit signal will affect the color range, and whether it hinders its ability to display the AdobeRGB spectrum.  As you can tell, I am completely unsure in this scenario.  

2)  I am questioning whether buying a cheaper alternative, such as the Asus PA248Q (100% sRGB), 16.7M colours, E-IPS 8bit panel, is a  more reasonable purchase considering the 8bit output limitation on my mac.

I have Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop CS3, so I'm assuming Illustrator would be the best route. I tried tracing a picture of a pickle and it looked pretty horrible.

Illustrated Word: Schizophrenia

Word is supposed to represent visually the word itself. Concept behind my design is that the word visually looks clean and orderly, because the mental disorder of Schizophrenia has order to it and is actually highly organized mentally. But at the same time, the word is breaking apart and shaky in its foundations, though you can read what it says, its not in the realm of ""reality"" much like the disease itself.

TL;DR: Want your suggestions on my design for the word Schizophrenia that i illustrated.

I have been really getting into creative tiling since I started it one year ago and have recently found the perfect tool to cut tiles really precisely. (which wasn't easy)But the problem is I need a printable vector image to do it.. So now I have been working on a design that could really be a masterpiece of art that I will actually get to install in a sauna for a friend when it is done. If you check out this link to imgur: http://imgur.com/a/QAmVk you'll see this dragon I've made a while ago(and so you know what I am trying to do exactly) and the design that's in progress for the next one. My friend really liked my dragon that I've done that's how come he wants one for his sauna and I had the idea to incorporate one within a yin-yang sign, to reflect balance, peace etc... (perfect for a sauna;) But as you maybe can see on the image.. I am not a graphic designer. The overall design is alright but I don't know a better way to get his scales looking better and actually going with the pattern of his skin.. could anybody explain to me how to do it? or have a look at it? I don't know how to post a vector so pm me and I'll send you the vector file, if you think you can improve it.. Also because it is so important for me, I have to be honest and say that even with all the scales correct, I am not to happy with my design overall. Thats why I also would like to ask if anybody could come up with a better design? please take into consideration I want the whole piece to be about 30-50 tile pieces perfectly balanced on a yin yang(excluding the scales, I am going to carve them in not cut them individually). I am going to use 3-4 colors of floor tiles only and polished black &amp; white granite for the orbs. I know this is quite the story/question but if there are any graphic designers out there with some time &amp; interest I would gladly transfer say $50 (only if I will use your design) and my extreme gratitude. and of course a few photo's of your design when it is installed in stone in a sauna.

For the past few years I've been developing my own websites for fun, piecing together different scripts, and making small code modifications where I was capable of doing so. I've pretty much just been learning as I go, and conquering barricades as I hit them. 

Up until now most of my websites have been small personal sites mostly consisting of either wordpress, vbulletin, or just plain basic HTML/CSS with some basic PHP code mixed in. I have some extremely basic graphic design skills, and I feel like I need to improve a lot in that department in order to really be able to make an impressive looking website theme. I'm pretty sure I could use some brushing up on my CSS skills to considering 90% of the design for wordpress theme's is pretty much in the CSS now. 

Can anyone recommend any good resources for learning more about website UI design, vector based logo design, and general graphic design in Adobe Creative Suite 6? I have a pretty good understanding of the tools in the Abobe Suite. I've been using it for a few years now. I just know I'm not using it to it's full potential, and I really want to. I'm a Network Engineer by trade, so I pick up anything technical fairly quickly. I also have an interest in art and design, so I'm super motivated to learn this stuff."	t5_2qrct	True

Thought this might be a good idea for other designers to view as well. If you have any good links for the community, please share with the rest of us.

1. What is the purpose of the re-design? 
2. What are you trying to convey with your concept?
3. What was successful with the previous design?
4. What was unsuccessful? 
5. Has your target market changed since the last design went live?

I've been messing around with design for about a year now and have  recently got very into it.

I started an ""agency""/""studio""/""firm"" a few days ago, mainly for fun and for some experience. I've got a couple of really good designer friends who are also involved in it. [Portfolio here](https://www.facebook.com/Pulsestorm/photos_albums). Not all of it's up yet, mostly branding, no illustration or art yet. I started lurking on the sub a couple of weeks ago and the portfolio has improved loads since then, but some more advice on generally improving the firm would be appreciated, as I'm planning to publicly launch it in a couple of weeks.

I've got a few questions to ask you guys, any advice would be much appreciated:
1) What do you think of the portfolio? What are the strengths, what could be improved and what should I include in future projects etc?

2) Is the range of services from that firm too wide? I set out to provide a ""complete package"" of services, but i feel like including illustration, typography/art etc in the same portfolio feels a bit disjointed. 

3) What do you think of the name ""Pulsestorm"" and the branding? Does the branding show skill? Is it clear it's a design firm?

As it was a friend who runs the place, I just charged him a low hourly wage for my work.  We both thought it would be a 1 time thing.  However, the employees have been wearing the shirts around and apparently enough tourist / visitors have asked where to buy the shirts that now they want to sell the shirts in the gift shop.

I am psyched about this, but now comes my dilemma... how should I charge the client now?  They want to pay me and have asked how I want to be paid moving forward, but I'm totally lost now!  I am not a graphic designer by profession, just do it for friends from time to time for small 1-off stuff.

So, do I charge a commission, a larger ""license"" fee, or what?  There's no 'work' left to do besides maybe an hour or two getting sizing / colors ironed out with the place that prints shirts for me and picking up / delivering shirts, so hourly doesn't make sense.

As the title indicates I am a teacher, a high school history teacher to be precise, who lacks design skills, but has a vision for some new classroom decor this year. My plan is to place a bunch of quotes around the room, both as decoration, and as part of a sourcing and fact-checking challenge I'll be running throughout the year for the students. The plan is to have some quotes that are taken out of context, and some quotes that are often famously misquoted mixed in as an additional challenge for students to practice their fact-checking and sourcing skills. Since I am a public school teacher I lack the funds to make this fancy, but I still want them to look good and be visually appealing for the students. My plan is to print the quotes on card-stock at my house on my color printer and then cut them out myself. What I would like is advice about where I could go to either find a good thematic, or design a good thematic, border that I can use on all of the quote-cards. Any time I design something it looks like it was done by a 6 year old, so I would need either a website, or opensource program that comes with lots of preloaded images or designs. Something that has to do with history, fact-checking, or the culture of bumper-sticker ideologies. Even a design suggestion that you think I could create in word or paint (these are the programs I currently have) would be super appreciated. Thanks for all suggestions in advance!	t5_2qrct	True

I first got into graphic design in 5th grade by using GIMP so I could make signatures for forums. I proceeded to take a class in 9th grade on graphic design and became really familiar with Photoshop and Illustrator. In 11th grade I got hired at a hardware store for retail work. At my work I would always talk to the IT guy about various computer-ish things. I worked there for about a year until the director of IT at the store asked me to join the team. Needless to say I was ecstatic. 

I come in once a week to design a weekly newsletter, help the director with some coding and then call it a day. 

My job so far has been great and I've had no complaints from any of the higher ups but it has certainly come to my attention that they respond better to *flashy* advertisements and newsletters rather than what I've also done which is minimalistic. 

It is completely against my instincts to attempt to great designs that look like those ads that you see on the side of websites. 

I was hoping that someone could point me in the direction of a tutorial or a read that would help me better grasp the concept of what I fondly call ""shitty but attractive"" design.

  I really really love doing graphic design and digital art. It is honestly probably the only thing I've done that I haven't gotten bored of, and I'm going to try to make it my career. Problem is, the only place I could ever do it was at school in my graphic design/illustration class. I'm switching schools this upcoming senior year, and they don't have this program. Then at home we have two ""family"" laptops, but neither of them can run Photoshop/Illustrator/Flash ect. Ive even tried the earlier versions, but I just couldn't get it working. Then even if I could I don't have a tablet, so I wouldn't be able to do much anyways. 



  Yesterday was my 17th birthday, and I got a whopping $220 from my mom and grandma! Its probably the biggest gift Ive ever gotten, and I'm so thankful. I don't want to blow my money on dog treats and candy like a younger me would. I want to get something that is actually useful and not only make them proud, but also get a jump start on my career. 



  I had been looking at tablets earlier in the year just to see what was out there and found this [Monoprice tablet](http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=108&amp;cp_id=10841&amp;cs_id=1084102&amp;p_id=6814&amp;format=3) that was cheap and had wonderful reviews. I'm not sure if I should get it because I don't even have a computer to use it with, so I thought I'd look here first to see if any of you guys might have an old laptop or tablet you don't use and would be willing to sell. Maybe you upgraded, didn't like it ect.. Scratched, dinged, missing parts, it really doesn't matter, if it works I'm interested. Any brand, make, or model. 



  I hope this isn't too odd of a request, I feel really dumb posting something like this. I really hope it doesn't sound like I'm begging either, I just thought it couldn't hurt to ask. 



  Obviously I cant pay a ton, but Ill give you whatever I have. I'm hoping to walk dogs this summer, so hopefully I might be able to save up some more soon, but I haven't been able to start yet because of some family junk. I'm going to stay positive though! 



  So anyways, thanks in advance. If you know someone who might have something they'd be willing to sell feel free to pass this on! You can comment or shoot me a PM, either works for me. Again thank you! Even just taking the time to read this warrants my gratitude.

It was painstaking trying to format everything and simply place the graphics down. It might just be because I don't know those word processing programs as well as I know Illustrator. But if I wanted to make the invitation in Illustrator instead, is there a way for me to make it and turn it into a PDF that is compatible with the word processing software that older folks who aren't designers would be using? I really want to make a nice invitation, but I don't want to take the power of editing away from them to where they have to send the invitation back to me every year.

1370720760.0	1fxwl2	A question regarding magazine layouts.	sadtastic	1	0	6	"I've been designing most of the ads and doing the entire layout for a small quarterly magazine for a few issues now.

My method, which has worked well enough so far, is to design the ads in Illustrator, and then export them as PDFs which I insert into the layout in InDesign.

However, if I neglect to convert an object or image to CMYK when exporting the PDF, it will give me an alert in InDesign that there are RGB elements (this happens occasionally even though I've got a PDF export preset to convert everything to CMYK, though my settings are obviously flawed).

My question is this: Would I be better off just exporting the ads from Illustrator as flattened CMYK TIFs at 300 dpi to avoid problems down the road in InDesign?

1370311698.0	1fmhx1	Questions about the field and advice for a complete beginner?	lotsofquestions2	1	0	5	"Hi guys, this could get long so feel free to skim!

I'm wondering how good of a field graphic design is to get into right now. It seems like in this economic climate nothing is a ""good"" field right now, but how is GD holding up? Do most people freelance or do they have full-time positions? What is your personal experience? 

Also just from browsing this subreddit it seems unpaid graphic design work is becoming a problem? Can people expand on this? How much is it really hurting business? Is there a chance this will only get worse with time?

Basically my story is I'm a rising senior in college at a top 25 university in the US. Next year I'll be graduating with a degree in both English and History. I was one of the ""study what you love"" kids but with graduation nearing I'm thinking more and more about the job market. Right now I've been marketing myself mainly around my writing ability- with my majors I've had plenty of practice and I'm fairly good at it. However, I've been thinking of ""extra"" skills I could pick up for my resume and graphic design is one.

I actually have an ""okay"" amount of experience in art. I've always been interested in it (thought about going to art school for a bit in high school) and I did a lot of work in ceramic sculpture and drawing. I'm fairly good at being able to look at something and copy it accurately (I can post some examples of my photo-realism work if people want), but I also do some cartoonish sketches as well. When I was a kid I was super into digital art, taught myself photoshop and bought a wacom, but it has been a good seven years since then so I've forgotten a lot. 

Sorry for the rambling, here are some questions:

What are some resources for complete beginners? I would like to relearn Photoshop as well as teach myself Illustrator. I've browsed some other posts and have collected a couple design blogs to look at, but further suggestions are great too! I feel like I need to do two things: absorb as much design as possible, and learn the mechanics of the programs. I already have a good handle on color theory, the elements of design, etc. from past art classes. 

At this point I'm not going to change my degree and start over. How important is actually having a Bachelor's **in** graphic design? Would going to a community college for it be a worth-wile investment?

Any other suggestions for a complete beginner? Also once again sorry for the wordiness!"	t5_2qrct	True

I know that they will want a logo with a couple variations for their sub-brands, but beyond that I'm a little stuck. Normally I wouldn't be shy about asking them directly what they are looking for, but I'm not sure they even know. So a few questions:

1. Typically when I've designed logos in the past, I come up with several concepts for the client, and they choose which they like and we work from there. Is this appropriate or should I present one concept?
2. Should I include images of the logo(s) implemented on something like a business card?

Why would something disappear from the artwork which had nothing to do with the element/ area the last minute change affected?

In my previous role, our designer used quark and I never experienced this problem on my brochure pages. What could cause this? And would a good design agency let this happen?

Anyways, they are just now switching to CS6 from CS3 and seeing as how my training was with CS2 and the tutorials I've been watching on Lynda.com have all been for CS5 (which is what I have at home) I'm a little concerned starting out might be bumpy.
  
Is there anything I should freshen up on tonight? Anything I should absolutely know in general? I'm really excited but also a little worried I'm in just a bit over my head. All advice will be greatly appreciated :)

Update: (in case anyone was holding their breath) I met a bunch of people, learned the branding standards and how to use the adhesive mounting press? and I even made a little flyer on my own (in Photoshop btw), which I mounted with the sticky mounter thing... Low stress first day but it was great and I'm happy to finally feel like I'm doing something I can get excited about! Thanks for all the encouragement and advice :)"	t5_2qrct	True

I'm just finishing up an iOS app and I've had a graphic designer creating the images used in the game, he's also had a fair amount of input on the general concept and storyline.

The thing is we had an agreement over what he would be paid which we both seem to be perfectly fine with but he has become pretty insistent on including some kind of logo to credit his work within the game preferably on the launch splash screen. E.g. designed by HisDesign.com underneath my logo. This was not discussed previously.

To be honest is was initially very much against the idea and told him so and he seems to agree the splash screen might not be the best place, but where else is appropriate? I feel sorta bad about saying no altogether because he has been very helpful. Any thoughts?"	t5_2qrct	True

I'm working on a graphic design project, and my client wants a ""cool"" graphic image demonstrating file conversion. His company makes said file conversion software. Essentially, what I need to show is that file formats A, B, C, and D (really many more, but for example's sake) can be converted to any other file format A, B, C, or D. 

A simple idea is to have a box of all the file formats, and a box with with the logo of the conversion software. Then have an arrow coming from the bank to the conversion logo, and from the conversion logo back to the bank. Essentially, a cycle showing any one of these formats can be converted to any other of these formats.

I've thought of an idea where I have an hourglass, with the file formats inside, and the conversion software in the thin middle part. Then to show that the conversion can work both ways, somehow illustrate that you can flip the hourglass over, and have the file formats work both ways. I'm not too sure about this one... 

I would really appreciate some ideas on how to show this process. In return, I promise to try to answer some of your questions :)

First off, sorry if this isn't the right place for this post.

I've enjoyed drawing my whole life, although I'm not exactly great at it.

The problem that I need help on is this: I'm considering going back to school next year for graphic design. There is a program at a college near me called ""Art &amp; Design Fundamentals"" which as far as I know is something of an introductory course into the design world, to sort of help you decide what you want to focus on as far as getting a degree goes.

Now, I already said I'm not exactly great at art. How good do you have to be to be successful in a design program at a college? If I enroll in this program, am I going to learn to draw better, or am I going to be expected to already be an artist and I'll just have all sorts of assignments that I won't be able to complete due to my talent, or lack thereof?

Sorry if any of this is hard to understand, but if you have any questions about what I'm asking I'll be glad to answer them.

TL;DR: Kinda want to go to college for a degree in arts, not exactly confident in my abilities to complete the program. Should I enroll anyways and hope I learn to draw better?  What skill level should I be at before attempting school for this sort of thing?

Any input is appreciated!

I'm specifically interested in making a simple gig poster for a band and thought I'd ask reddit to get more informed about the process. I've been (loosely) following the instructions [here](http://www.paper-leaf.com/blog/2009/10/how-to-make-a-cool-vintage-gig-poster/) just for starters. The poster might be grayscale, so the suggestions to color before are mostly just brainstorming. I have a few specific questions:

1. Any free, simple software similar to Photoshop out there? I want something a step up from MS Paint, preferably something you can import images into and change Hue, Contrast, Saturation etc. Messing around with the color levels is probably the most desired feature that MS Paint doesn't have.

2. Any hints on typography? I'm planning on using [Credit Valley](http://www.dafont.com/credit-valley.font) (all caps) for the band name and venue name. No ideas on color schemes yet, but once I get a decent software program, I'll mess around a bit. 
3. I wanted the background to look something like [this](http://www.vectorfree.com/gold-paisley-pattern-vector), obviously lightened quite a bit, and possibly a different color (or extremely light grayscale if I decide to go that direction)

4. Any other advice? Am I in over my head? Should I post this in a different subreddit?

1348983410.0	10p8tj	Want to get your work out, being used, with a link, to show you mean business?	rimadden	5	3	2	"Was told I should Xpost this here -

Designers of Reddit - I run a charity start up based in Iowa, that's hopefully gonna spread eventually. (we're a UNA, which isn't a 501c3, but we're offering something we think is better than a tax write off.) I signed up for sparked.com 10 days ago, they appear to be having an issue.

We're out to help kids. Poor kids, foster kids, kids that could use some help to live a normal life, when no one else gives a crap.
(www.tot-mob.org[1] ) can be found here. The basic idea is crowdfunding, but for kids that are in a crap situation in life. Kids that want a chance to do things that because of finances or whatever, they just cant. A kid comes to us needing a trumpet cause he's been playing the school loaner for 3 years and can't tolerate being ""that kid"" anymore. We're gonna help him get one. That he or she owns.
Kid wants to play football, all he's got are some Chuck Taylor's, off we go to Dick's to get you some shoes.

They come to us with a need, we verify it, we figure out the cost, we set up a project, and we and everyone else that we can convince that it's worth spreading the word about, help get it funded.
That's enough backstory - you can read how we started and what we're doing next on the website.

The font comes from losttype.com you don't have to use it, but if you want to, go to town. I chose it because it looks like the track pieces from electric slot cars. It's called ""bender""

The colors - don't matter greatly. We're using a company kind of like zazzle to do the shirts to save us from having to put forward the money to set up, screens, and minimum shirts. They print pretty crisply. We can lay the image on close to 40 different colors of shirt and see what works best.

The shirt could include the url somewhere but not necessary, we gotta get the awareness up, so we can get the point across. Playful is awesome, puns are awesome, cartoonish is awesome. Toys are awesome. Super heroes are awesome. (infringement isn't though.)
I've taken to calling the people that help us ""Mobbits"" Our next pseudo-fundraising event is a NERF gun war. (was today, was a riot.) We try to have as much fun as possible, and make crazy things happen for kids that need it.

Here's what we're offering - You design a shirt for us. Thinking 5 in total from different designers. For now. We'll see how cluttered it looks and go from there.

It goes into our store. We ""mark up"" the shirt at a total of $2. This store has pretty awesome book keeping so I know exactly what each shirt is doing, how many sold, what sizes, colors, etc. Here's where it gets nifty - We're only gonna keep one of those dollars. You tell us what awesome charity you want the other dollar to go to, and we send it out. (Just make sure they're in the U.S. please, we're not sure how nuts this is gonna get.)

But wait, there's more! This design - we're gonna give you credit for it in the store description, with a link to your online presence (portfolio, website, wherever). It'll be considered ""on loan"" and if you want us to stop using it... Its a done deal. AND!!! We'll let people know where your dollar goes. I will work this out to get you as much backlinks/mentions/general good PR as possible, I'm a freaking champion for anyone that helps us. I have a basic understanding of how SEO works, and I'm not afraid to use it.

Couple things to remember - It involves kids, so watch the tone. Ninja's are cool, Ninja's stabbing the metaphorical tiger of poverty... not so cool. Not for a shirt anyway... The idea is we're an online flash mob of sorts. (IRL as well.) An army of philanthropy. Hundreds and thousands of people that give a damn.

Questions? You have a great amount of artistic license with your design, go to town. Dont want to do a shirt? We need damn near everything. Twitter backgrounds, facebook, you name it. We dont make any dollars off of those, but I'll definitely plug the hell out of you for doing the work."	t5_2qrct	True

Long story short, I know my portfolio is vanilla, at best. I want to know if I should either.. 

a) continue applying for jobs (I get interviews, just can't land them. I believe a LOT of this has to do with the interviewers not seeing my portfolio before hand, and then looking at it in the interview itself)

b) or work on my portfolio for a month or two, and then start applying

You can view my portfolio [here](http://goo.gl/8ozOQ), and my CV [here](http://goo.gl/zaCWO).

My plan is to do work for free, for the companies that I've already done work for (for example, do a logo or a brochure for some of the companies, that will add to my portfolio). 

A note..

- Yes, the websites are all wordpress templates, meaning I didn't design or code them - because I don't know how to. It's a piss poor excuse, but it's true. I have no passion or desire to learn how to either. I have tried countless times. I hate coding.

Ideally, I'm looking for a reliable, quality color laser printer that can handle various (reasonable) weights of paper, from regular laser paper up to 60lb/80lb card stock.

Looking for any info, recommendations, tips, advice, etc. What to look for, what to avoid, what companies deliver, what companies have terrible customer service (HP?), anything at all. I looked at the HP officejet pro 8600 plus at Costco and read reviews on Amazon, but heard terrible things about the fax, paper-handling, software, and customer service, as is to be expected from them.

Usually the web signatures will contain that users name or something that they represent, enjoy, something funny, really anything that the user wants to represent his/her online alias.

In this Imgur album I will link below are some of my favorite signatures that I have created over the years.

Anyway as the week goes on I continue to get submissions some better than others and by the end of the week i settle on a design which im fairly happy about. From the time I select the winner the designer has 5 days to send me the original files, well 5 days come and go so i decide to message the designer. After 3 days of no reply from the designer I decide to email the company, I tried one email on their website but it comes back as not a vallid email (Great!) eventually i find another email that works and send them an email about my predicament. Another week goes by so i decide to visit their facebook page and it is there where i see a handful of other paying customers having the same exact problem as me... So now i am in the middle of a dispute with paypal trying to get my $100. So i guess my question is if i show someone here the logo i picked is there anyway you could recreate?

When you are looking for ideas for any projects, do you have a place to go for inspiration? For new ideas? I'd appreciate any helps/advice.

I have no problems generating the graphics in PS or AI but I don't know what format to use.

Do I create a giant 36x84 inch file and place the graphics in some sort of flattened outline of the display stand?  Do I submit lots of smaller files with directions on where they go?  Without seeing what the original files look like; I'm really lost.

I just got initial feedback from them that it looks too Diner-y. I thought this was a really good initial design and am a little bit at a loss. Should I scrap it and start over? Any suggestions to change it to make it look less diner-like?

Or do I say ""this is a great logo, trust me""? Or did I miss the mark and give them junk? Could I be too close to the project to see it objectively?

The terms:

* I design 3 initial different concepts for you after you tell me what you want.

* Then you review them, tell me what you like/don't like and you choose 1 of them to develop it further (or if you don't like any of them, I can design a new batch for $50 extra)

* You get **unlimited** revisions for free (that means I will work until you are 100% satisfied with the result, even if it takes a month)

* I work in Illustrator (vector) so your logo will be completely scaleable and printable. Also you get .AI / .EPS and .PNG and .JPG and .PSD (layered) of the final logo

* You pay **after** I design the perfect logo for you but before I send you the source files

* Payment methods: PayPal, via Freelancer, Moneybookers (Skrill), or if you want to ask about something else - drop me a PM

The price range starts from 200$ for typical logo design work, but this is just so you know what to expect. For actual price for your project contact me with information. 

I know that some of you are on a low budget and you are used to seeing designers work for $30 on some forums, but this is totally different. I am talking about the real process of designing a brand image, something your company can proudly stand behind. Also please be aware that communication is key, the more you succeed in telling me what you want the better.

If you're wondering about a time frame the designs are usually completed in under a week, but of course that depends from a lot of things.

But, I kinda fell out of it all about 4years ago. Haven't touched it since. Really want to get back into GD, and make people signatures and things. But the one thing that I miss the most is the smallish close knit communities/forums that have Sig competitions, and a place to share your work and get C/C while building a reputation. I always thought that was fun, and my last home is no longer around. 

So I'm asking y'all, where can I go that has a nice IPB/PHPBB forum? One that I can show my work, get it critiqued, enjoy off-topic conversation, join community competitions, read and post tutorials, etc.? Preferably a smallish-close knit community. They were always so much fun!

**My job description:**

* Re-link all content in InDesign - basically making all new ads

* Unify body text and edit new text

* Re-design many of old ads so they are more attractive

* Align EVERYTHING properly

* Create new headers for sections

* Cover image - originally it was 200px x 100px or so

* Rearrange ads and text as I see fit


    


This project is something I lovingly call 'Landfill' - recycle a neglected project into something I am proud to present.  All I had was a hard copy and the old PDF file.  Thank God I had the PDF.  Many of the ads were done by the publisher or the publisher's son.  They had no problems whatsoever with me redoing practically everything.  



I used InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop.  Word was used for some editing of the articles as I received them as .doc, but most was done in-program in InDesign.  



If it were up to me, it would have a much more polished, modern look.  Truthfully, I am not a fan of Bevel and Emboss all over the place, but I did what I could.  



The print result was more incredible than I could have imagined.  Just the sharpness of the images alone impressed not just the publisher, but the ad buyers.  It took me over 50 hours of work, but I got paid for every last second of my time.  I don't care that it's a small newsletter for bikers in the tri-state area.  All I care is that I now have something truly worthy of putting my portfolio.
