1367479608.0	1djfbt	I saw a deep one. [x-post from r/lovecraft]	balfourcraig	38	2	8	"At university today, I saw an oldish man who had the ""Innsmouth Look"". He had wide eyes that didn't seem to blink enough, he had no lips and his teeth looked pointed, he had his collar up, so I couldn't see if he had the folds of skin/gills. No noticeable smell of fish, but I didn't get very close.

I know it's fiction, but it actually scared me (probably not very PC to the poor old man)

And the original stories had New Zealand as the closest point to R'lyeh, and my city is on a deep harbour.

Anyway, interesting story. I think I have been reading too much Lovecraft lately :) Has anyone else seen things that look like they were from Lovecraft's world?

PS.
Is there anyone who actually believes what Lovecraft writes? I read an interesting thing saying how far ahead of his time he was, and he understands concepts which weren't thought of in his day. The article put it down to premonition (not something I believe in). Are there any people who do think that he was more than making up his works? My theory (not my own) is that he was a genius who suffered severe night terrors, which he then wrote about.

It's one of the few games made that explored Lovecraftian horror themes. It's most noted feature was a ""sanity meter"", upon encountering enemies the meter would deplete, and the game begins playing tricks on the player; flipping rooms, threatening to format memory cards. I figured some of you might remember the original or be interested. This project is attempting to create a spiritual successor to that game.

In summary:

&gt;Albino Dragon will license the use of Chaosium's 'Call of Cthulhu' IP [...] so that anything we have done up to this point can remain intact as Shane had originally envisioned it.
&gt;
&gt;The tuck box will have some extra verbiage added indicating that it is a licensed product of Chaosium's IP.
&gt;
&gt;**We will be producing a separate run of 2500 decks** (and potentially more) for Chaosium that will have their own custom artwork for the card back and the tuck box. It has not yet been decided if Shane will contribute to this process.
&gt;
&gt;**There were not any additional fees or royalties involved.**

I must say, this is downright classy of Chaosium, and seems to benefit everyone involved. Chaosium gets 2500 decks it can sell at a profit, Dahlman gets to keep his Kickstarter, and we get awesome cards.

1325379469.0	ny42v	To everyone here at /r/cthulhu; wishing you a horrendously good New Year.  		21	5	2	"2011 was a year that will be a footnote in history, although it was a year equally as important as the rest. It has shaped the way for our future. Many dictators have died or have been overthrown. Many once poor nations have flourished economically. Innovators and artists have died, while the innovators and artists of the future have been born. Lives have been changed and shaped forever. 2012 is up next; don't waste it, and have fun. It's a wild, wild world. Oh, and remember.

The winter solstice of 2012 will occur at 11:11 GMT on December 21st 2012, the same day the Mayan Long Count Calender flips over or ""ends"" as some say. On that morning the sun will appear to rise into the area of the sky we refer to as the galactic center or nuclear bulge. It is the location of the super-massive black hole at the center of the rotation of the the Milky Way galaxy. The sun's position in the sky on this day will also be perceptively aligned with the ""Dark Rift"" (the dark band that to the eye seems to divide the bright band of the Milky Way galaxy). Additionally on this day, Jupiter and Saturn will be involved in an astrological formation known as a Yod (finger of God.) With the combination of all these celestial events, the ""stars will be right"" and Cthulhu will begin to awaken.

At the proper time,""the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from his tomb to revive His subjects and resume his rule of earth....Then mankind would have become as the Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy. Then the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves, and all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom"" 

In 1997 (15 years in advance to 2012) a ""bloop"" was heard in the southern Pacific Ocean within a 500 mile proximity of the supposed location of Cthulhu's sunken tomb-city known as R'lyeh located at 47°9′S 126°43′W. This ""bloop"" was louder than any known animal noise (even whales) and suggested to possibly be from a gigantic cephalopod.

Cthulhu's appearance has been said to be of a gigantic cephalopod with a body like a man's and bat-like wings. ""a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind""

I should probably mention the fact that I am not offering to GM said game as I have no experience with it.

There seems to be enough interest in running a CoC game through roll20.net and I've been talking to pkcs11 about running it since his (her?) offer to GM was first. PKCS11 says that he(she) is willing to run a game once per month with up to 8 players, new players are welcome. So if you're wanting to play message me your email address so I can add you to the distribution list and we'll get started setting up a time for everyone to get together to start.
At the moment we are looking for 7 more players so I'm going to handle this on a first come first serve basis."	t5_2qmzi	True

Meet Joe. Joe is your average freshman- wide eyed and eager to learn. He doesn't mind the food from the Diner yet, and thinks he will always go to his 8 AM Math lecture.
Joe is taking the course THEO 237 : Ancient Rituals and Forgotten Terrors. (It fulfills his Humanities requirement.) 
This class if full of... interesting... students. Apparently they're all part of some frat and always wear the same hoodie.
Joe was trying to get ahead in the class, so he went to McKeldin to find some books for supplemental reading. (The bookstore didn't have them-- big surprise.) He searched through the secret sub-basements in a locked off section of McKeldin for the specific book he was looking for. 
""Ahh, here it is! The Necronomicon!"" The ragged book smelled like decaying flesh, or possibly Natty. Joe sat down for a quick read.
At approximately 2:10 AM on October 31st, a student stumbled from McKeldin Library after a late-night study session, nearly crashing into Testudo in his stupor.

What I know: 

I know that Cthulu is an ancient supreme being. I know that he lives in a city at the bottom of the sea called Rylieh (spelling may be off.). I know he is just one of many ancient supreme beings created by Lovecraft in his horror stories. I know that the Necronomicon is the book that summons these ""Old Ones"" to our realm. Finally, I know that he is the Lord of Darkness and chaos. 

What I want to know:

Where do I start reading? Which book? What book will give the most information on him or which book in your opinion, is the best read? Are there books of short stories I should look at perhaps? (Because, as I said before, I have a lot on my plate on a daily basis. Short stories are usually my forte for this reason. In fact, I've started to read ""Black Wings"", which is a book of short stories by Lovecraftian authors. Its good so far.) Is any of the above information incorrect? Is there an actual religion devoted to Cthulu? I know that there are some parodies but if there is a real one I would really be interested in learning about it. (Not necessarily joining it however, I tend to be more of a secular humanist, but their theology should be interesting. Also, I'm not crazy. My mother had me tested.) 

If you had the iron will to read this whole thing, then I thank you greatly. I tend to ramble a lot. Thanks for taking the time to read it, and thank you for helping me. :) "	t5_2qmzi	True

AndSushi	12	4	8	"Okay, so I've been reading through the Lovecraft/Cthulhu mythos, and there are a few of the stories, in particular, that I really enjoy, and a few that I'm not really enjoying so much. 

My favorites have been ""The Dunwich Horror,"" ""The Color Out Of Space,"" ""The Haunter Of The Dark,"" ""The Music Of Erich Zaan,"" and of course ""The Call of Cthulhu.""

The ones I haven't been so crazy about were ones like ""The Doom that came to Sarnath."" (I guess I just don't find the lizard people/fish people/ape people/etc all that creepy or compelling.)

Other stories like ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" and ""At The Mountains of Madness"" were enjoyable, but weren't as creepy as the ones I listed as my favorites, at least in my opinion. I think I just really enjoy the stories where people encounter things that they cannot even describe, that just drive them absolutely crazy.

That being said, what other stories (written by either Lovecraft himself, or in the extended Cthulhu mythos universe) would I enjoy."	t5_2qmzi	True
1344613174.0	y015f	The Quahog Connection - A serious idea for a family guy episode incorporating light Lovecraftian themes.	momsdayprepper	15	4	11	"Given how close to Quahog (meaning Peter Griffin’s house) Lovecraft is buried, I’m surprised there hasn’t been some form of Lovecraft joke yet on the show. Not even a single night-gaunt? I think it’s crossover time, Seth, even if the show already took a transcontinental flight over the shark.

What about an episode where Stewie goes insane from Lovecraft’s supernatural influence over the town of Quahog (because nobody in Providence remembers him, and Stewie is his only fan for miles). Lovecraft is totally Stewie’s bag.

I’ll write the episode if I have to… Does anybody else think this has potential?"	t5_2qmzi	True

I have lots of Lovecraft's literature, but this is all text with no pictures. I can't seem to find a good resource that explains the meaning of the symbols and what they look like. There is the Elder Sign, but from what I can tell there are two different versions of this. One is a star with a flame or something inside while the other looks vaguely like an antler. Also, from what I have read, the Elder Sign is a way of protecting ones self from the elder gods? Is this accurate? Also, there is a movie called Dagon that is a loose adaptation of The Shadow Over Innsmouth. In it there is a symbol shown inside the Dagon church that is a circle with a pair of tentacle shaped things protruding horizontally from either side. Is this a real Lovecraftian symbol designed by Lovecraft himself? Or is it just something they mad up for the movie? Any light that you can shed on these or any other real Lovecraftian symbols would be great!

It's my first time DMing (and playing tabletop in general), but the first session played out well and I think I did a pretty solid job and got the stamp of approval from the rest of the group.

Anyway, we're doing a bit of a variation on The Haunting ""starter campaign"" because the old DM kind of botched it and I had to change a bunch of shit, but I enjoy writing and story building so it wasn't a problem. I want to continue with the story building and realize how much of an undertaking a decent campaign that isn't coming from a book can actually be. I want to push the group initially north to Arkham to explore some situations possible by drawing material from The Colour Out of Space, but I have to base it out of Arkham and need to find some information on it.

I was given some .pdfs of books by a fellow player, but they don't quite have what I need. There's some information in one of the books I have, in Before the Fall. The introduction mentions The Compact Arkham Unveiled as a source, but I've been unable to locate it.

I wouldn't mind purchasing the books, but I have limited time to go looking around book stores and comic shops and haven't been able to find it. But I don't want to buy something without knowing that I'm going to be getting the information I need off Amazon or something.

Even if it's not lore related to the campaigns for the game, I'd appreciate maybe some sort of map and a bit of general background information, characters, happenings, etc. There's a fair amount of stuff and some sort of general compendium of the happenings in and around Arkham would be eternally useful for me.

*Painted and inscribed on flat stones
Abhorrent to the deep ones
Abhorrent to their great father
Is the symbol to guard against Dagon

Created by the elder things
Long ages past
To guard against Dagon and his spawn

No deep one will cross a threshold
that has the symbol painted upon it
No deep one will follow a path
that has the symbol upon it
No deep one will emerge from a beach
that is strewn with stones
bearing the sacred symbol

By this sign those who dwell
near their submerged city of cyclopean stones
are not molested unless they venture into the waves
where the deep ones exact
a terrible vengeance upon them*

Of the Pre-Human Serpent Folk 
and Communed with Long-dead Reptiles 
Silently Watching Through the Ages in Cold, Curious Apathy. 
The Unending Sorrows

of an Abysmal Humankind.

I Dare Not Again Surrender 
to the Deep Sleep 
Which Ever Beckons Me.
Lest I in Dread. 
Shudder at the Nameless Things. 
That May at this Very Moment. 
Be Crawling and Lurking. 
At the Slimy Edges of My Conciousness. 
Slithering Forth from the Bowels of Their Infernal Pits. Worshipping Their Ancient Stone Idols 
and Carving Their Own Detestable Likenesses 
On Subterranean Obelisks of Blood-soaked Granite.

Off the top of my head I can think of 10-15 really well done turn-based RPGs. The writer(s) of this game used NONE of the good concepts and ideas from those games. It's as if the developers figured they had a better way of making a game, and they started from the ground up.

Sadly, the inability to get things done efficiently and quickly means they've managed to slow down a turn-based game... yes, t's turn-based and slower than any turn-based game ever made.

If I wasn't fumbling back and forth the control options to figure out what is normally a basic maneuver I was stuck parsing out my character's movement into smaller chunks because the game can't handle one large movement with several turns.

I know it's been done before, I've even seen bumper stickers IRL, but I think the design we eventually came up with is better than the others out there.

So, check it out: [""Cthulhu '12: Why Vote for a Lesser Evil?""](http://hackthetruth.spreadshirt.com/cthulhu-for-president-A6573856/) and tell me what you think.

P.S. A note on shirt printing and cost: these days I see a lot of crap shirts designed up and printed with digital direct. It's like a huge inkjet printer for t-shirts and fabrics. Anyone who's ever owned such a shirt knows how much they suck. The print material quickly fades, then crumbles and comes off the shirt, leaving you with something you don't want to wear. This shirt is printed using a method called flex printing, which works by cutting out pieces of a think vinyl like plastic and then adhering them permanently to the fabric. This makes the shirts expensive (I make basically no commission on them), but it also makes them last extremely well and retain their color better than anything else I've ever seen. Despite repeated washings and repeated wear (I've had one of these shirts for 10 months and have worn it at least once a week), the shirt looks brand new."	t5_2qmzi	True

Would it be a slow, creeping armageddon? Ships disappearing mysteriously, artists and other off-kilter thinkers slipping into insanity, strange lights in the sky; all building until the Big-C steps from his crypt?

Or would it be sudden and violent? Cthulhu's mind suddenly driving a quarter of the population murderously insane, Deep Ones rising from the waves with their Shoggoth servants to lay waste to all they see, cultists committing acts of extreme violence in terrorist attacks all over the world?
