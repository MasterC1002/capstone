1345475865.0	yixuu	"I went into my local comic shop and was called a ""poser""."	frosty	1011	254	654	"I freely admit that I'm not as much of a comic book fan as I used to be. When I was a kid in the early 80's,  I had subscriptions to all sorts of comics from DC and Marvel. I loved reading anything I could get my hands on and loved the escape they provided. But as I grew older, I fell out of it once I got married and spent less and less time buying.

Now I'm 40 and I wanted to get back into reading and collecting. I asked around online (including a few messages to redditors) on some suggested readings. I printed out the list and I went into our only local comic book store.

I walked up to the counter and handed the guy my list and asked him if he could help me find these books. He took a look at my list, sighed at me and then put the list back on the counter.

He then proceeds to call me a ""poser"" and say that people like me are the reason why the comic book industry is dying. He said if I was a ""real fan"" I should have kept reading, as that's what real fans do.

Maybe he had a really bad day or something, but I fail to see how I'm a ""poser"" and how people like me are the reason why the comic books stores are dying. He went off for about 5 minutes and I'm standing there like an idiot, trying to be polite, and thinking that he'll end his rant and help me out. 

Needless to say, I didn't buy any comics there. I left and went to a book store and bought what few I could find there. I wasn't an asshole and I wasn't demanding with my list, I was excited about diving into something new.. and this guy totally ruined it for me.

Is it because I stopped reading for 20 years, or just that I'm not the target demographic anymore? I'm actually at a loss to figure out what the deal is.

EDIT: I should mention that there was some kind of miniatures wargame going on at the time that I went into the store. It was pretty humiliating to be dressed down in front of people like that. The guy was maybe a 40/50-ish guy, so I'm assuming he was the store owner. "	t5_2qhon	True

This is not a rule change, this is not a mandate. This is just something I'm asking as a person.  
  
/r/comicbooks is my favorite subreddit. And the main reason why is because it's wonderfully free of all the things that make the big subreddits annoying. Memes are almost never used here. There is very little complaining about reposts. Upvotes and downvotes are hardly ever mentioned. All those annoying Reddit in-jokes like ""Poor Colby"" and ""Just wrestling"" are never said.  
  
And yet, recently, I've seen more and more people mentioning it's their ""Cake Day"" when posting something. So you may be thinking, ""What's the big deal?"" The big deal is that, frankly, people on Reddit care entirely too much about imaginary Internet points. /r/comicbooks has always been a place where people talk about comics and share stuff about comics simply because they love comics. Once the karma whore mentality starts to set it, that'll deteriorate. People will post stuff that just seems easy. How long before we see constant meme posts?  
  
Every single time I've ever seen ""Cake Day"" mentioned on this site, it's somebody feeling like they have to make a post because people will give them Internet points as a gift simply because they've been using the site for a while. It's the first symptom of a much larger disease. So I'm asking this, not as a moderator, but as a member: Keep /r/comicbooks about the comics, and not the karma. Because once it becomes about the karma, we get less content of value, and more content that panders to the masses. And I don't think anybody here wants that.

&gt; So sad to learn of the passing of another comic book legend. Carmine Infantino was one of the great influential artists in the history of the medium and I will always look upon his Adam Strange, Flash and Space Museum stories as wondrous examples of fantasy made even more magical at the hands of a master. RIP, Carmine.

From [CBR's](http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=44738) article...

&gt; During an interview with The Comics Journal in 2010, Infantino offered some insight on his career in comics, choosing to finish the interview by thanking his colleagues.

&gt; ""I really do want to thank all those wonderful artists, writers, editors, staff people, every one of them that I worked with. I think they were wonderful people, brilliant and creative, and I enjoyed every minute with them. And they made my job a joy,"" Infantino told The Comics Journal. ""I’d like to finalize this with some quotations from two people that I think will sum up my whole world of comics. One was Charles Dickens, in The Tale of Two Cities when he said, 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.' And then, Paul Ankas wonderful line, 'I did it my way.' That sums it up for me pretty much."""	t5_2qhon	True

1375658434.0	1jpfy6	Scott Snyder: Coolest/Nicest guy in Comics	jamieson1080	569	88	135	"So today I was at the Boston Comic Con, where Scott was signing books. I thought I had missed my chance at grabbing an autograph, as I didn't get a ticket early enough, but because he stayed an extra hour after his surprise Batman panel was finished, I lucked out. 

Now it was obvious listening to Scott talk about Batman, Greg Capullo (Fun fact: they didn't get along at first, but are now great friends) and answering fan questions that Scott has a deep love and respect for the characters, his co-workers, and his fans. He came across as genuine, cool, funny, and extremely gracious. 

I even got to ask him a question. I asked him how he felt taking on Superman, as DC seemed to have struggled truly modernizing him in the new 52. He gave a great lengthy answer that tied it all back to his work on Batman and ended the panel on a great note. 

But that's not all. I was second in line waiting for him to come out and sign some comics. He recognized me immediately and thanked me for my question. Then he proceeds to pull out his phone and show me brand new Jim Lee art for the next issue of Superman Unchained and allows me to stand there, wide-eyed, staring at his cell phone while he starts signing the next guys books. I wanted to stay and check it out longer but I knew he was already in a rush and didn't need me hanging around taking advantage of his kindness. So I thanked him again and told him that I hoped he felt like a Rock Star this weekend, to which he replied that he was super lucky to have this many fans. 

So in summary, Scott Snyder is an awesome guy. He made my week and he deserves all the praise he gets as a writer. I wish there were more guys like him working in comics. "	t5_2qhon	True

If you need to find out more about me, having a nose around [www.kierongillen.com](http://www.kierongillen.com) would probably do the trick. I'm on twitter as kierongillen too.

Basic version: I used to primarily be a game journalist, where I worked for everyone from PC Gamer to the Escapist. I was also one of the founders of cult PC Gaming site [Rock paper Shotgun](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/). While I was doing all that, I was doing my own photocopied indie comics. Eventually, I hooked up with fashionable-haircut-purveyor Jamie McKelvie and wrote PHONOGRAM for image. That got a bunch of attention, and lead to work from everyone else. That includes Marvel (credits include Uncanny X-men, Journey Into Mystery, Generation Hope, S.W.O.R.D., Thor, Beta Ray Bill, Ares and - most importantly - Batroc The Leaper), Boom, Tokyopop and Avatar.

And that'll do. I am your humble servant. Feel free to ask me stuff and things.

EDIT: And that's me done here. Thanks for all your questions. As a final sort of plug here, my latest issue of Uncanny X-men is out today. It's actually my favourite, and a standalone issue, so a good one to try if you're not following. [There's some more details and a preview over here](http://gillen.cream.org/wordpress_html/?p=2464).

Also, if you can't get enough of asking me questions or seeing my awkward answers, I also run a Formspring. [You can continue to prod me over there, if you wish](http://www.formspring.me/KieronGillen).

This time the ""gotcha"" text is buried in the ""Wedding Bells for Webhead"" section, with a NEWLY ADDED bit:

""This comic is for a Amazing Fantasy reprint only, not an original, pictures listed for the item do not represent the item sold nor do they represent the comic in anyway. Bidder/Buyer accepts that he/she as read the full description of this listing before placing a bid **and accepts that no legal action will be taken on the winning bidders/buyers part**. Good luck!""

You know what to do....

Be sure to mention that it's already been pulled down TWICE and that this is the third time he's listed it.
