1342283892.0	wjy2m	Please don't crucify me for this. But here is an idea I have been kicking around for /r/bleachshirts		242	36	46	"Please read through this and upvote for visibility, I would like as much input as possible and will take it through the comments. lots of upvotes will not make this decision for me.

I have been wanting to do contests and drawings here for a while. The biggest issue is that I cant afford to buy or ship out any prizes.   
  
So I was considering creating a little shopping list in the sidebar using the amazon affiliate program and if there is any income from that using it to ship out fabulous and fun prizes.   
  
I don't want this to turn into a Saydrah thing (abusing reddit to make money) but I also thought if nothing else it would provide a good idea of the materials needed and an easy place to get them all at once.  
  
The link to this would go in its own box in the sidebar with a disclaimer letting anyone who goes to click on it that money would be raised from purchases. 
  
Reddit is about the community so I wanted to get some feedback from everyone.  
  
Thanks for reading and keep spraying.

1336808500.0	tjffe	The official /r/bleachshirts FAQ question thread!		156	30	131	"Several people have asked about it and now we are doing something about it. What questions do you want in a frequently asked questions thread? Ask them here.  
  
 I will gather answers you provide, try to provide answers myself, and compile it all into one huge thread with links to videos, picture galleries and all kinds of fancy and wonderful things.  
  
With the first round of questions Here is what I have thrown together.  
______________________________________________________________________________ 
  
**Stencil Materials**:   
Many people here have discussed using **[freezer paper](http://www.reynoldskitchens.com/product.asp?prod_id=1798)** Which definitely is the way to go if you are making a 1 time use stencil. If you expect to make several shirts or are new to this and want a stencil you can test first you might want to try stencil paper. A large roll of freezer paper is nicer also if you want to do a larger design. Stencil paper also wont work in many printers so a cutting matte and an x-acto knife are good investments.
  
Personally I like being able to reuse my stencils So I use stencil paper. Stencil paper is just paper coated in a waxy material that is slightly transparent which is nice for tracing. The wax also strengthens the paper so it is less likely to tear when using a tack spray and the bleach wont destroy the stencil. Right now I am using **[this](http://shop.hobbylobby.com/products/wax-o-stencil-paper-427013/)** kind of stencil paper but I also found **[this](http://www.amazon.com/Inovart-Stencil-It-Waxed-Stencil-Paper/dp/B005A0J7TA/ref=sr_1_2?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336837267&amp;sr=1-2)** on amazon  
   
I have also invested in one of these **[matts](http://shop.hobbylobby.com/search/default.aspx?searchTerm=Self+Healing+Cutting+Mat)** which helps to save money on your cutting blade. The clear one would probably be best as you can use it on a makeshift tracing table, or if you have a glass desk just set a lamp under your desk like me.
    
**Bleaching a New Shirt**  
Many people are commenting that the bleach is not working as expected, in most of these situations I have found that it is a new shirt. New t-shirts usually have starch and sometimes even a wax sprayed on them to protect them during shipping. **Always wash and dry a new shirt at least once before trying to bleach it.**    

**Bleach**   
Ok so bleach is pretty easy, I have had great luck with your standard cheap **[wal-mart brand bleach](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Bleach-3-qt/13023508)** I usually do a 50/50 blend I will tweak the ratios + or - 10% but I try not to make it more concentrated than that for fear of destroying the shirts.  **[Here](http://i.imgur.com/HDloo.jpg)** are some**[crappy pictures](http://i.imgur.com/DrlvC.jpg)** of some of the stencils I have done. Never use a color safe bleach as it can be unpredictable. I have found that a finer mist spray gives better coverage but I like the effect of larger droplets sometimes too.   
  
I have thought about using gel bleach but haven't got the chance. Generally the bleach pens are made to be a ""color safe"" bleach so wont work as well.   
  
**VERY IMPORTANT DO NOT MIX BLEACH WITH VINEGAR OR ANYTHING BUT WATER.** Here is why
Basically, yes vinegar will stop the bleaching process but it also releases very toxic chlorine gas. I mention elsewhere here that I use a large (150 gallon) cooler filled with water to get the bleaching to stop, once a shirt gets to the level I like I will rinse it out in the water. You really can use a smaller container but I usually cut all my stencils for a while and then make shirts when I plan on making 10+. Making 1 at a time a 5 gallon bucket should be ok for 2-3 shirts but I would wash them as soon as you are done rinsing them.
  
**The different effects...**  
I was fairly vague in the heading of this one because I am not personally very familiar with many different effects. Finer mist means a smoother image. How you choose to make your image is a great place to start, Are you masking off the area so your image is being protected or being sprayed? In **[this](http://i.imgur.com/HDloo.jpg)** shirt I linked above the stencil was the image so I was spraying the shirt and the stencil was the mask, there are other examples where you would lay down a small stencil and just spray at it and let the splash damage just be part of the picture **[This](http://i.imgur.com/z1xDB.jpg)** is a good example of that method. Or as in **[this pony shirt](http://i.imgur.com/DrlvC.jpg ""Rainbowdash is best pony"")** I masked everywhere but where I was spraying.   
  
**Glue**  
  
This is another example of my lacking some experience. I only ever use a low tack spray on my stencils while some people have mentioned just ironing the freezer paper onto the shirt. If you want to use glue I recommend **[this](http://www.krylon.com/products/easytack_repositionable_adhesive/)** or something like it, just remember to let it sit for a minute or so before placing the stencil on the shirt or the stencil and the glue can both be very difficult to remove. 
  
  
**The Effect of Bleach on your clothing**  
  
Generally I have found that black shirts tend to go to a brick red then fade out to gold then white. Blue shirts go to yellow red turn orange and purple turns pink. How light they go depends mostly on the concentration of bleach and how long the bleach stays on the shirt. I use a 50/50 blend usually and that gets me where I want to go. If I want to make it really light I will go up to a 60/40 blend and let it sit longer. Eventually they all turn white and then disintegrate at a certain concentration level.  
   
**When you are done bleaching** 
When I am doing these shirts I usually fill up a very large cooler in my back yard with water so I can dump the shirt into it and dilute the bleach to stop the shirt from getting lighter than where I want it, rinsing the bleach under running water will probably be more than enough.   
   
After rinsing thoroughly I will then wash the shirts. I usually try to do at least 2-3 shirts at a time so I cut out all my stencils at once so prepping a spray station and cleaning all the stuff up isn't as much of a pain in my ass.
  

**Adding Colors**  
  
So there are a few Ideas I have had about adding color. The best way I can think of doing it is just by drawing on the shirt with a fabric pen. I have also considered adding color with a 2 part stencil. Basically what I have been thinking of doing is making a 2 layer stencil spraying the first layer then **[dying](http://www.ritdye.com/)** the shirt and spraying the second layer. Why do it this way? Well because clothing dyes are generally made to work by soaking the fabric in the dye for an extended period.   
  
By bleaching a shirt you are creating a void where that new color can go, but you want to make sure the dye works with your shirt color. Some dyes are designed to only work with cotton, using a red dye on a green shirt will probably look more like a baby crap brown instead of a festive x-mas shirt. I was going to try my first batch using a black shirt so that the color will hopefully only show up where I bleached. Try it yourself and get back to us.     
  
  
**Some troubleshooting**  
  
You might have noticed the black shirt in the pony shirt examples I showed you. The black shirt was the first bleach shirt I ever did, the large blotchy parts are from not gluing the stencil down correctly and not dabbing the stencil with a towel before removing it. When you spray the stencil the bleach can pool up and deposit itself in large blobs on the shirt like you saw there this can also be caused by the shirt getting too moist and bleeding under the stencil.  A good way to avoid this is to dab your shirt and stencil with a towel after spraying.
  

_____________________________________________________________  
I wanted to point out that everything I have here came from trial and error, if you have an idea please document the steps you take and the result and share it here, even if you dont like the result someone may take your idea and do something different with it. The whole section above about colors for example is purely speculation.

I full on cheated by not using freezer paper. Instead, I used a pre-cut vinyl. Did it outside in direct sunlight. Sprayed six times and let it sit for twenty (20) seconds. Dabbed the big globs of bleach off with a towel and set my timer for two (2) minutes. [These are the results.](http://imgur.com/a/Abyif)

The 50cotton/50polyester blends did nice if you were shooting for a pleasant off-color. They took a little while to actually start the process, so you might want to leave the stuff on there longer than two minutes. Bleeding was non existent.

Most of the 100% cottons worked out great. Rich, vibrant color and I could really notice the color change right away. One 100% refused to take hold. I have no idea why. The 90c/10p would have worked if I had left it on longer, but all got the two minute treatment.

I would have left the bleach on all the shirts for longer, but it was hot as balls.

1338694170.0	ui472	Tried my hand at a two-stage shirt.	orbitalfreak	49	4	8	"I wanted to work with a stencil in two ways on a shirt, positive and negative space. Once with bleaching through a stencil, and once where the stencil masks the shirt from bleaching. Here is the final product: [pic](http://i.imgur.com/FdSIw.jpg)

I used this image from HBO for the head. [pic](http://www.hbo.com/assets/images/series/game-of-thrones/downloads/stark/wallpaper-stark-sigil-1600.jpg).
The words were found on another image somewhere, I forget which exactly. 

I don't have step-by-step pictures, but here's the rundown of the procedure.

1) Cut out the wolf head template. I used a large sheet of freezer paper for this. The entire head was cut out from the stencil, and then the individual fur and detail pieces were removed from that. What was left was a netting of freezer paper, so that the lines would get bleached, while the black of the shirt was covered by the stencil.

Lots of tiny pieces, and the teeth were a pain. :-/

2) Bleach the wolf's head as normal, then soak and dry.

3) Cut out the letters for the logo down below. Here, the stencil forms the letters themselves, with the shirt uncovered. Use a second wolf-head stencil (this one is solid, no pieces removed) to mask off the wolf head to avoid re-bleaching and bleaching the interior of that design.

4) Bleach &amp; soak again, this time focusing on making a spray around the words."	t5_2sq68	True

Tomorrow will be the first shirt of the week competition. As of right now we have no prizes, with any luck that may change in the future. It may not be much but I am going to start setting aside a few bucks here and there to hopefully start giving out reddit gold for the winners.  
  
These are the rules I have in mind for the shirt of the week.
  
 * No shirt of the week thread, A mod (most likely me) will go through the posts over the previous week and pick the individual shirt with the most upvotes.
  
 * only individual shirts will be considered, posting galleries is fine but if you want a shirt to be considered for shirt of the week don't post any other shirts in the same gallery, feel free to post a gallery of the process or multiple pictures of the same shirt.
   
 * You must post the shirt prior to the day of the competition any new shirts posted on sunday will have to be submitted for shirt of the week the following week.
  
 * To submit a shirt in the upcoming shirt of the week you need to include at least a photograph including the shirt and a note with your reddit ID clearly visible [**like this**](http://i.imgur.com/tAd9O.jpg). I want to make sure that everyone gets credit for their work.  
  
 * If you don't use the appropriate tags your shirt will not be considered. Obviously this will not apply to the first contest. I was trying to figure out a way to encourage everyone to use the tags. This seemed like a good idea. ***this rule will be obsolete before long as untagged posts will be automatically caught by the spam filter  and removed, stay tuned for more info.*** 
__________________________
   
Regarding other stencil based shirts, based on the messages I have recieved the vocal majority seems to be in favor of keeping this reddit focused on bleach. I am fine with that. That being said the only requirement I feel should be necessary is that bleach is incorporated somehow into the design. IE bleached stencil with sharpie/paint/whatever highlights Or the other way around.
    
Please upvote this post as I still haven't really looked into how to sticky it.   
  
As always, I am only one person and really want your feedback before I make changes.  
  
Be excellent to each other and as always, spray on my friends.   
  
~your friendly neighborhood Moltar.

Though since that day I have been busy and not very attentive/logged in. In so doing, the subreddit got its first burst of subscribers and began to stagnate due to my lack of moderation. 

I am pleased to see what a great community this has evolved into, with people sharing their wonderful creations, and above all helping one another.

But on to why I am actually writing this....



A while back I made [Moltar_the_fabulous](http://www.reddit.com/user/Moltar_the_fabulous) a moderator and because of that we've seen a huge jump in subscriptions, a great sidebar, and a generally well managed subreddit.

I will be sticking around as a mod in hopes that in the next few weeks/months I will be able to contribute some more. Yet  I am mostly writing this because I wanted to thank Moltar, and wanted everyone to know how he took this subreddit by the reigns and has been doing a great job.

So everyone give Moltar a nice round of applause, and know that the good things that have been done, have been done because he is here. "	t5_2sq68	True
