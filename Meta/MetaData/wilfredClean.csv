* Soon we hope to have spoiler tags on this sub-reddit so users can block out text that will reveal spoilers. Until then, **read this thread at your own risk.**

* We also hope to get a live chat up and running too. Either through IRC or another website/service. 

* The link to this thread will remain at the top of the sub-reddit until next thursday, so people who don't have the chance to see it tonight can still find it easily.

* This will be a weekly thing for each episode.

Get excited for the new season! Because it starts tonight @ 10:30 on FX. I'd also like to take this time to say that we've passed 1,000 subscribers! Hooray!

1374876283.0	1j4iti	"(Spoilers) ""Intuition"" thoughts, new text post since this sub is painfully low in users :("	Fsoprokon	44	8	14	"* Dad = ego
* Wilfred most likely the id.
* Ryan, of course, is the superego.
* None of this psychological stuff is necessarily true, more or less, just convenient labels.
* Wilfred doesn't (always) exist.  In this episode, there were instances where Wilfred wasn't noticed in certain circumstances.  Same as in the last episode.  May be tricky to spot, but just pay attention to when nobody but Ryan acts like he exists.  Case in point, when the other dog could hear Ryan but not Wilfred.  Wilfred even pointed out he was right there but the dog still couldn't hear him.  This fits with the theme of Ryan being crazy.
* Ryan is obviously troubled.  This is his mind creating sane scenarios when dealing with Ryan's troubled actions.  Of course he sees a conspiracy, much like a drug-user would think everybody is ""out to change him"" or ""control"" him.  This is the obvious direction this show is going, but more on that at the end.
* This story was the traditional neighbor getting killed bullshit we've seen in other shows stretching for material.  Now, this was a Scooby Doo filled episode, *and* Ryan was watching Scooby Doo in the beginning, fueling this somewhat lame series of events.  Still, this is getting pretty heavy handed.  I think this really might be the last season, or wrap up obvious answers, leaving tidbits for the next season.  Sort of like an epilogue.

On the Ryan being crazy front: I can see this as being a misdirection by Wilfred (Ryan's mind, or perception of reality).  Sort of like a test, if Ryan is truly capable of what some of us would say, ""transcending"" this reality, communicating with his mind in a very literal way, whereas most people only have an inner, obvious dialogue.

It could go either way at this point.  These are just my observations.

Thanks for reading.

As an addendum, I want to give props to the Wilfred going civil rights on the Scooby Doo cartoon.  This is exactly what you would hear if animals were fighting for recognition, and, in many ways, animals are coming into more and more dignified rights.  Played so straight but still absurd to somebody that doesn't think about it, and mindblowing when you do.  This humor is very cutting edge.  

EDIT: Notice in Intuition when Wilfred is sleeping.  It's during the scene that Ryan is talking to his sister about help, and she suspects drug use.  As if Wilfred's voice is subdued when Ryan is in full control.

* Each dream uses set pieces in Ryan's subconscious representation of himself and the forces working within him, or, clinically, emotional attachments to past injuries personified by people in his life, resulting in unstable views of reality.  This leads me to think that there are 3 possible endings to this series

1. Ryan is crazy and this is the result.  It will result in a catharsis for Ryan, allowing him to retain his sanity, or, barring that, closure on Ryan ever getting better.  His mom would be an example of his fate were he not to confront his issues.  He would retain his sanity by defeating his views on his Dad and family, and especially Wilfred.  Wilfred in this case would represent his ""insanity"", the dark side, whatever term you're comfortable with, and Ryan would defeat this.  Or, less dramatically, learn what to listen to and what to ignore from everybody in his life, including himself.  The latter is a bit cartoony, but it could be a feel-good show in the end.  I'd be okay with that.

Message?  Life is complicated and intense, and these things happen very personally to people in our lives.  We must understand them instead of looking down on them, because to themselves, they are indeed living meaningful lives.  Or some iteration of that.

2. What I said above.  That Wilfred is a representation of mind that works differently.  I mention ""transcended"" before, but I don't even think it's that.  It's just different, analytical, artistic.  I think we could all agree on Ryan being artistic.  Like his mother.  This is how he projects his shattered mind.  Yes, he's still technically ""crazy"", but not really, since he would be a functioning person with what we would term a mental illness.  I imagine this ending will be seeing Ryan as happy yet at peace, accepting of the feelings in his life, instead of always fighting them.  Go with the flow.  In this one, Wilfred would always be around.

I admit that this 2nd ending could end with some sort of cackling Elijah Wood sitting in his imaginary basement plotting shit with Wilfred, but I don't honestly see that happening.  That would be quite tragic, sort of defeating the entire message of the series.  I don't think the creators of this show would demonize inner knowledge, or create such an ending to demonstrate the dangers of disregarding it.

Message of the 2nd?  Peace is more precious than all things, and peace mean self-awareness.

3. Ryan is dying from the suicide attempt and this is his oxygen starved brain slipping into that next whatever the hell is waiting for us (yes, even darkness), and he's desperately clinging to life long enough to expunge himself from all ""baggage"" before leaving this realm, consciousness, life, whatever.  Essentially, his life is flashing before his eyes, but a sort of imaginary life in which he figures himself out and why exactly he killed himself.

Message the 3rd?  There's no escaping life.

I don't know how to change that numbering up there, so we're all going to have to use our imagination on that one.

we almost know nothing about Ryans life before the suicide attempt. we know he was a lawyer and that he had a fall out with his father at work so as a result we can ASSUME that he couldnt deal with the aftermath and depression. but I think something more important than just depression had derived Ryan to attempt suicide. 

I cant recall a single moment when Ryan has explained much about his past. I remember one episode where Ryan is suspected of stealing the neighbors things so he turns up to this party where people ask him about his past and he ends up holding up his tongue in his hand, which to me indicates that Ryan must have done something significant in the past which he doesn't want to share with anyone yet (i dont think hes said anything about that to Wilfred either which means the writers dont want to reveal this to the audience).

I think in the next season we will find out a lot more about Ryan's past, especially with the possibility that Wilfred may have been involved with Ryans childhood.

Episode - 1 Ryan actually kills himself
Then he goes to purgatory and the show starts.
Nobody is real except for Ryan and Wilfred (and a select few.)
Wilfred is there as a guardian angel to guide Ryan.

Ryan's whole life was full of being pushed around, illegally doing his job, living a life of submissive servitude, and doing nothing to better himself.

Those were his sins and Wilfred is there to show him how he was living a terrible life and not living life to its full extent. 

Wilfred first has to show Ryan how to stand up for himself and this explains why Wilfred badgered Ryan until he finally took a stand marking Ryan's first real change.

The rest of the time Wilfred is showing the aspects of life that Ryan passed by and what he was missing out on. i.e. friendship, loyalty, sacrifice.

The other guy who talks to Wilfred in the other episode is also dead. Wilfred did the same for him that Wilfred is now doing for Ryan. The man is simply visiting Wilfred to help Wilfred help Ryan, and now that that man has passed on he truly appreciates what Wilfred did for him, and they are friends.

When he visits his mom, she has died recently as well, her guide is a cat however she is further along in the process than Ryan is.

Wilfred is purposely a bad influence on Ryan sometimes so that Ryan will learn to stand up to Wilfred and doing wrong as well. This way Wilfred keeps Ryan in balance.

In the final episodes Ryan will either pass on to the next world, or wake up from a coma, Jenna never had a dog (but does exist, he sees her right before he takes the suicide cocktail), but Ryan will inevitably ask her out, and will live a more assertive and honest life.

1.) When Ryan was young he had a troubled life - that's the explanation for why Wilfred is in the painting. Ryan always subliminally knew he was there, but Wilfred never talked at that point. He just always saw him somewhere, walking with an owner, running around in his front lawn, etc. He wasn't *his* dog, he was just around, as guardian angels tend to be (according to people who believe in them IRL), so Ryan inserted him into his picture.

2.) Ryan had just tried to commit suicide, and here comes Wilfred! Wilfred is there to try and help Ryan out of his tough times, and each episode starts with a quote, which is a lesson - and your guardian angels is supposed to a.) protect you, and b.) teach you things, which Wilfred has done many times.

3.) No one else sees Wilfred as Ryan does, which is similar to how guardian angels are in real life. Guardian angels tend to be ""real"", as in a physical person that's actually there, but no one sees them as the person being helped does. They seem them as someone who appears out of no where and starts fixing things, teaching them things, or talking to them in a way someone who was ""normal"" wouldn't, while if they point the person out to someone else they're just seen as a normal person. This is paralleled with Wilfred just being seen as a normal dog to everyone but Ryan.

1376035483.0	1k0jka	Show Theory After Watching S03E09 [SPOILER]	lintonrentfro	38	8	32	"After watching S03E09 in which [we are led to believe that Ryan's sister drew Wilfred as a child and therefore sees or has seen him (Ryan is only seeing Wilfred in the drawing, and his sister didn't draw a Wilfred)](/spoiler), here's what I think the whole point of the show really is:

The show is trying to make you think and feel like Ryan.  That's it.  Wilfred doesn't exist and it's all in Ryan's head.  All theories about Wilfred possibly being a magical being, other people seeing Wilfred, conspiracies about Ryan's dad, etc. are all the result of viewers thinking like Ryan, which is exactly what the show is designed to do.

(In fact, I've seen a couple theories that are actually very similar to the crazy stuff a disturbed person in real life would come up with to justify their crazy thoughts/hallucinations.  Think about how successful the show has been if this theory is correct.)

The show's purpose is to take you through the wide range of thoughts and emotions of Ryan, a very troubled young man.  If you make a list of all of the stuff going on in Ryan's head, you get a list of episode titles.

I don't think there is anything more to the show and I don't think there needs to be.  They've done a good job of tricking/coaxing viewers into thinking like Ryan and sharing how he feels.

The show might end with Wilfred being a magical creature of some sort, but imagine how you'll feel about the show if they end it that way or with some other similar contrivance. Now imagine how you'll feel about the show if at the end you are forced to recognize (simultaneously with Ryan I hope) that Wilfred wasn't real, Ryan is/was a disturbed guy, and you didn't just watch Ryan's journey, you shared and felt it with him.

There is simply zero emotional payoff to a complex ending involving conspiracies/magic/etc, but a huge payoff if viewers and Ryan have to face the truth together.  Part of you will object to what you've just seen because Wilfred was so entertaining and interesting, and another part of you will point to those feelings and say, ""ah, that's what Ryan's feeling""."	t5_2sl2e	True

1364693207.0	1bc1qx	After watching 2 seasons in one week, and reading some theories: a little detail I haven't read here before [Spoilers]	SkaveRat	33	4	7	"First off: I absoltely love the theory that everything is just a ""fuck you"" to all theory-makers and Lost-esque series, and in the end it's all just making twists and cliffhangers without reason.

But I also like the ""being totally nuts"" theory.

So it's pretty clear that the basement is just Ryans closet. The breakthrough in 2x1 is just him going from ""not so crazy anymore, I see realisty"" to ""well, I liked my own reality much more"".

Ryan has had a hard childhood with his parents, and in the panic-attack episode we see him crying, his sister telling him he should stop or their father woul get mad.

What if Ryan always hid in his closet when he got sad or his dad angry? He probably took Sneakers with him there aswell.

So, now he's grown up, and every time he's depressed and grabs his bong, he goes with wilfred hotboxing in his closet. ""Just like in the old days"".

When he got his first panic attack with the baby, he immediatly ran into the ""basement"" aswell. As a reflex, because he did the same as a kid.

1348059686.0	104th6	Theory: How the tennis ball, the father, the basement, and the mother all relate to and may be direct references to The Shining. 		35	6	7	"Most people have seen The Shining. If you haven't, don't read this because it's a great movie that shouldn't be spoiled. The following contains major spoilers for The Shining and also spoilers for anyone not caught up to the last aired episode of Wilfred (Resentment). 

This is my theory. In The Shining, Jack Torrence throws a tennis ball over and over, almost violently, with frustration over his job (writing.) After a while of this he just throws the ball into the darkness of the hotel. Later, Danny is playing with his trucks on the carpet, and that same tennis ball rolls up to him, serving two purposes: luring him into Room 237, and beckoning him to play. The implication is that the ghost twin girls wanted him to play (""forever and ever and ever"") and join their side. Also, it could be that the hotel itself (which ""shines a little"") rolled the tennis ball to Danny - symbolically the frustration of his father rolling up to meet the child through the means of the hotel. Danny does not pick up the ball. He does however get up and he finds the door to Room 237 already open with a key inside the door, sort of asking him to enter. If Danny had picked up the ball, I imagine it would be symbolic that he would in fact be joining the other side with the twins by the end of the film. In the end of the film and in the novel I believe, Danny lives and does not end up joining the ghostly staff and residents of the Overlook.

Anyway, here's the similarities. Ryan's dad is also obsessed and perhaps driven mad by his job/workaholism. Ryan's friend, the only friend we've seen him with other than Jenna and his girlfriend(s), tells Ryan that his father is obsessed with him and wants him back. In the Shining, Jack became obsessed with Danny, because the hotel and its unearthly residents want Danny (who ""shines"") and his abilities to join their side. That tennis ball was technically thrown from his father's anger and landed right beside Danny, and also Ryan. When Wilfred offers the ball to Ryan, he's asking him to play (""forever and ever and ever?"",) and unlike in The Shining, Ryan accepts the tennis ball. This may have dark implications, or just be a symbol that Ryan joined the other side (mentally, at least.) The kicker may be that Ryan's dad may have been the first one to 'set the ball rolling' so to speak, just as Jack in The Shining. A father's anger and frustration landed in the hands of his son, and in Wilfred, his son took it on. In Wilfred, the dog was the carrier of the message and the tennis ball. Wilfred is then, a direct manifestation brought on by whatever Ryan went through with his father and being raised in such a way that he felt so much pressure to do everything perfectly and never fail, going so far as to cheat at his job with those black files. 

Ryan's mother and Danny's mother both faced similar situations. The presence of a possibly abusive, but definitely angry and stern husband and father caused them both great stress and unrest. Danny's mother can barely hold it together and is nearing insanity of her own due to all the stress and how she fears Jack may kill her and Danny. To a lesser degree, Ryan's mother was probably driven insane by this hostility and criticism, etc. We can't say for sure if he was abusive, but it seemed implied in the final scene of the episode where Ryan trips on Peyote, and implied through Ryan's dread and fear over him. Ryan's mom also sees a companion animal in the form of the cat, as seen in season one. As a side note for the overall show, the cats and dogs at those mental hospitals are normally referred to as ""Therapy Cats"" (or Therapy Dogs) and are used to help patients reconnect with life and their own emotions. 

Now, could Room 237 and The Basement have anything in common? After Danny is offered the ball, and I mean *right* after, he goes into Room 237. The tennis ball is a lure into the room, the very room Danny was told never to go into by his friend Dick Hallorann. Once Ryan accepts the tennis ball, he begins to hang out in his non-existent basement. Most fan theories from The Shining imply that Room 237 never existed but only as a way of facing fears (the old hag woman representing things that cause fear and harm.) Was Ryan lured into the basement, too? I'd say so. (Edit: Also the tennis ball rolls up to Ryan's feet from inside the closet/basement in the final episode of season one. I think that's a pretty direct reference.)

Anyway, here's the main point. In both The Shining and Wilfred, a tennis ball was offered to them by a member of the other side, in a roundabout way the father being the source. In The Shining, Danny doesn't pick it up. In Wilfred, Ryan does. In this show, perhaps, Ryan's not joining the world of the dead, even though he tried to in Episode One. He's just going back into his own mind, the basement holding his deepest feelings and emotions, and exploring them with the help of his Therapy Dog. Maybe it isn't so dangerous for Ryan to go into the basement, although we can see it isn't exactly easy for him to explore his darkest recesses. In this show's case, the tennis ball offered to Ryan may have come from his father, but he's being helped bit by bit, emotion by emotion.  

What's all this mean for the show? Maybe these references to The Shining infer, or want the audience to think, that Ryan has paranormal abilities. He's really seeing a type of spiritual helper in Jenna's dog, maybe a type of mischievous pooka. Ryan (and his mother) could be shining. Likewise, it could just be references to the brilliant movie dropped here and there because the show boasts intelligent writers and The Shining is of course a classic.

I think that in that episode Ryan will have figured something out. He will have some kind of answer that he has to tell Wilfred. But Jenna isn't letting him see Wilfred. Finally at the end of the episode he gets her to agree to let him see Wilfred. Wilfred is at the back of Jenna's house. Ryan rushes into the back room to find a dog. Just a dog. The dog immediately recognizes Ryan and runs to him. Wimpers at him. But Ryan is shouting ""Where's Wilfred? Where's Wilfred?"" Jenna is confused and says ""What are you talking about? That is Wilfred."" And the dog just looks up at Ryan with a very sad look and Ryan looks bewildered and lost. "	t5_2sl2e	True

Note, Ryan discovers the basement is just a closet at the end of Season 1.  Note also, Ryan then goes on to have a shitty (in his opinion at the time) job.  Eventually, he snaps.  Notice it is then Ryan starts to day dream with himself at a mental institution.  He does this so intensely that he forgets that it is he at the job that is real and not the MHI.  After he realizes the aforementioned reality after having been told by day dream Wilfred to ""push through"", Ryan pushes through the closet into the Basement.  What I think is happening here is Ryan is pushing himself back into that delusional safe place.  Therefore, everything that happens in the basement is just Ryan's schizophrenia.  I posit there was no pit full of cat, I posit Bruce, Ryan, and Wilfred all played that nonsensical game in a place not of reality, etc. etc.

Besides a few jokes from the Australian version showing up in the first season of the US version, they are very different. In the second season finale it takes the power away from Wilfred and implies that he does not know why he exists. Like all things in this show, it could be Wilfred messing with Ryan. But it leads a lot of people to believe that Ryan is the one in charge instead of Wilfred. They talk about being on a plane with no pilot. 

But what if there is a pilot? At the end of Season 2 of the Australian version Adam and Sarah break up and Wilfred appears to another man. What if Jenna plays a bigger role in this than we initially gave her credit for? For instance, Bruce sees Wilfred. Maybe Bruce isn't a figment of Ryan's imagination. What if he really does see Wilfred? What if the connection Bruce has to Wilfred is that Bruce used to be Jenna's neighbor? 

As far as Ryan being crazy, that just seems like an incredibly boring answer to a complex question. "	t5_2sl2e	True

While I am certainly not a psychology or psychosis expert, I think the show should end with Ryan showing some progress toward being mentally healthy, but not completely better.

I see Wilfred as a hallucination that Ryan is having (depression-induced hallucination? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotic_depression) in order to cope with his crappy life. If Ryan were to completely heal, that would mean the end of Wilfred as a hallucination. For obvious reasons, I don't really like that ending. I don't think people ever really get over mental health issues; they just learn how to manage them better. If this were the case, Ryan wouldn't see Wilfred as often, but it would still allow for Wilfred and Ryan to be together when Ryan really needs Wilfred.

I like this option because, in my opinion, it provides some closure, Ryan starts getting better, and it isn't really a cop out. What are your thoughts? Terrible idea? Have modifications?"	t5_2sl2e	True

One thing that I must say is that the show is a lot darker and a hell of a lot deeper than I originally expected. I keep feeling like the themes presented in each show are in-depth enough to warrant some extra time for more analysis. Also, the ongoing story seems as if it has to be cut a little short because there isn't much time within 22 minutes to fully delve deep into the mind-bending plot and character development.

I realize it's as a sitcom, which usually runs 30 minutes, but I just feel as if this show is far from your average sitcom and contains a lot more continuing narrative than most. Perhaps it's just due FX not thinking that the show has enough of a following to take up an hour of programming? "	t5_2sl2e	True

With Season 2 close at hand we're looking to make this subreddit more active and better than ever. For that we need your help.

1) We need a sweet new logo. [I'm thinking something like this picture,](http://assets.huluim.com/shows/key_art_wilfred.jpg) except Reddit Alien style.

**UPDATE**: [We got a logo!](http://i.imgur.com/fRgKd.png) Thanks to our founder Lewis614! Think you can do better? Than prove it! We're still open to logos!

2) We need some more people. I know that there are many fans of Wilfred out there in Reddit. We just need to find them.

3) If you have any other suggestions for this subreddit feel free to post them below. This is your subreddit.

So let's get this place moving. The countdown to Season 2 has begun. "	t5_2sl2e	True
1330533452.0	qbh44	For those of you who have seen both the AUS and US versions, how do you feel about the drastic change in the female character?	liah	16	2	6	"The only thing I don't like about the US version is Jenna. She's your every day Perky Hot Dumb American Girl (tm), and you can find her type in basically every sitcom since the beginning of time as one in a string of completely interchangeable, identical, stereotypical characters that have no real depth or purpose other than motivating the hero through their beauty. 

The AUS version, on the other hand, features a sarcastic, non-stereotypical girl, Sarah, who actually has personality outside of ""be perky and hot! YAY!"". She swears, she talks back, she challenges, she makes mistakes. She isn't afraid to break social norms. She's dimensional and human (as far as comedy goes, anyway).

Anyone else wish Sarah was in the US show to replace Jenna? Or do people actually like Jenna? And why do you think they so drastically changed the characters? Does an American audience really just want the Perky Hot Dumb American Girl (tm) stereotype? Would a Sarah-like character have been marketable? If not, why?

Now, in the latest episode ""perspective,"" the blue barn is seen again, in Ryan's drawing. When Ryan looks up and sees Wilfred, there is no barn. However, once Ryan starts chasing Wilfred, something is noticeable. Right as he jumps over the fence, you see a small, blue dog house. I'm not sure what it means and I would like your input on it. Regardless of whether or not I can decipher it myself, I do believe this blue dog house is very important. You see the blue barn/dog house in countless episodes, in paintings in the background and so on and so forth, it's clearly very important to Ryan's memory. And now it is revealed (unofficially) to be a dog house. So what does it mean?

I come into peoples lives in their time of need and I stay with them until their lives are straight again.

When my girlfriend found out that I had never seen Good Will Hunting, she insisted I'd enjoy it and that we should watch it sometime soon. When we woke up this morning, we decided today was the day to watch it.  

Welp, the day went along for awhile, just hanging out. Early evening comes along and we start getting our things together to head on over to her place when she asks me if I knew when the new season of Wilfred was starting.  I told her I wasn't quite sure but that it might be this week.  Before looking it up to check, I decided to throw on some music. I chose some My Morning Jacket.  I had acquired a few of their CDs from a friend in March but had only listened to them through once a piece. (media player shows this)  

I come to find that the new season starts tonight but that there's already a ""preview"" episode available to watch.  We decide to watch it before taking off... My Morning Jacket reference AND Good Will Hunting reference.  

The episode itself was a mindfuck and a half... but the fact that we decided we're watching Good Will Hunting tonight, the fact that we're about to walk out the door when we decide 'hold up lets check real quick to see when Wilfred season 2 starts,' the fact that I never listen to MMJ but just so happened to put them on while looking this up, the fact that Wilfred Season 2 starts tonight, and the fact that we then watched the preview episode which has MMJ and Good Will Hunting references makes it a double mindfuck/synchronicity for me.

They were real pills and he overdosed, but he is is a coma right now, reflecting on his life as well as dreaming of what it could be, but uses Wilfred as a vehicle to help him carry on.  In ""real time"" Ryan may only be passed out for a few hours  on the way to the hospital and at the hospital, but is living inside his head so the time is infinite until he is ready to face reality.  


Once he is able to face himself and reality he will wake up in a hospital bed surrounded by Jenna, his sister, his dad, James, possibly his mom, and Bruce will be his doctor. 


Jenna saved his life because instead of him waving to her through the window, he collapsed and she saw him so she went to check on him and called an ambulance.


Jenna does not have a boyfriend and only does in Ryan's mind because he is always making excuses for why his life is always wrong, but when he wakes up this time, he will not make excuses.

The ending will be Jenna inviting Ryan in for a glass of wine and on their way in the door there is a dog sitting in the corner.  Jenna tells him that her dog's name is Wilfred and then the show is over.

1373930939.0	1idi20	I think there are clues that point to Ryan's father orchestrating everything	nelsnelson	9	5	11	"**TL;DR**: Wilfred is playing the most important role in an elaborate long-con to stoke the fires of Ryan's congenital proclivity to mental instability, to drive Ryan insane, and therefore contain the damage he could do to Ryan's father's criminal enterprises.

I think that Ryan's father, who is evidently a very wealthy man, is orchestrating Ryan's insanity.  I think Ryan's father may actually be paying Wilfred to pretend to be a dog in order to convince Ryan that he is actually indeed insane.  Lots of other people have to be in on it.

1. Ryan's father's is wealthy, powerful, the head of a law firm, and is probably the ruthless mastermind of a vast criminal enterprise.
2. Ryan has left his father's firm, because he discovered something that made him leave and decide to have nothing to do with his father ever again.  He chose to not go to the police and turn state's evidence.
3. James, Ryan's old best friend, a previous associate at his father's law firm says that his father will, ""Do anything to get him [Ryan] back at the firm.""
4. Jenna is in on it too.  She appears to break down and admits that everything she does is taking advantage of Ryan's obvious crush on her.  Ryan mistakes this admission as her admitting to just leading him on.
5. So far, Ryan has only admitted that he sees Wilfred anthropomorphically to Amanda.  But Amanda was just a patsy because James was getting too close to Ryan and therefore too close to Ryan's father who was the actual perpetrator of the wire-transfer fraud.  My guess is that she was paid off handsomely, and a reduced sentence negotiated for her by the ultra-powerful lawyer that Ryan's father is.  At first I thought that Amanda might have actually thought that Wilfred was just a figment of her own imagination, but then she misquoted what Wilfred said to her.  I think this may have been done deliberately, in order to allow Wilfred to perpetuate his role as Ryan's handler.  Or maybe Amanda really was just crazy.
6. Wilfred slipped up once in trying to convince Ryan that he is indeed crazy, by showing Ryan the crayon drawing of himself lurking behind a tree.  Ryan realized that if Wilfred was actually a dog, then it would have been impossible for Wilfred to be in the picture which had been drawn 20 years before.  But Ryan failed to understand the real truth, that Wilfred and his twin have always been around, because they are just humans, just 20 years younger.
7. Where did Wilfred and his twin come from?  I don't know.  Perhaps Ryan's father sired them along with some Australian mistress.  Perhaps they are actually clones that were paid for by Ryan's wealthy father.  But that's a little far-fetched.
8. Wilfred gets upset whenever someone who is not involved in the long-con comes into contact with Ryan.  For instance, he is nowhere to be found when Ryan tries to get his first roommate.  Wilfred only shows himself to the roommate that (I think) his father hires to respond to Ryan's ad who shows up later -- Anne.
9. Wilfred says to Ryan after Amanda is apparently arrested (though that's never shown), ""Without you I have no purpose. I'm nothing. It's like I don't even exist.""  Perhaps this alludes to the fact that if Wilfred fails to continue in his role of convincing Ryan that he is crazy, by pretending to be a talking dog, then Ryan's father will execute or otherwise dispose of Wilfred in some way.  Or, perhaps Wilfred is just an insane clone, brought up from childhood to believe that he actually is a dog, and is convinced that he has no other purpose but to look after Ryan.
10. In the episode Service, when Ryan visits his mother at the end of the episode and helps her paint, her painting is of a woman (played by Rhea Perlman) sitting on a bench (http://i.imgur.com/oFazuXw.jpg).  ~~Though it is never specifically stated, I believe that~~ (Thanks, [thekotoz](/u/thekotoz)) this is Catherine's own anthropomorphized pet cat (her Wilfred) who passed away at the beginning of the episode.  This could still go either way.  Perhaps Rhea was the representation of Catherine's actual hallucinations, but this still might not indicate that Ryan is actually crazy and that Wilfred is Ryan's equivalent of her mother's hallucinations.  It could still be that Catherine's anthropomorphized cat hallucination played by Rhea was the inspiration for Ryan's father (who would have learned all about his wife's hallucination) to create Wilfred (through either a brainwashed insane clone, or through some other mechanism of exploitation of the man pretending to be Ryan's anthropomorphic Wilfred).  Or perhaps, even more diabolically and elaborately, was a woman who was similarly hired or exploited in order for Ryan's mother to be convinced that she too was crazy.  This may be unlikely, though, because if both Ryan and Catherine were not crazy, then Ryan would have surely had some encounter with the woman who was pretending to be his mother's cat.  In all likelihood, Ryan is sane, and his mother was crazy, but she was the inspiration for Ryan's father's plot to convince Ryan that he is crazy in order to protect himself if Ryan ever went to the Feds with the black books.

Ways to prove the theory -- that Wilfred is just an elaborate long-con to convince Ryan that he is insane, and therefore contain the damage he could do to Ryan's father's criminal enterprises -- involve Ryan managing to escape the constant monitoring of Wilfred and Ryan's father in order to find someone outside of Ryan's father's vast sphere of influence to confirm that Wilfred is indeed just a human in a dog suit.  Somehow that's never happened yet and so convincing us, the audience, that Ryan is crazy.

Ways to disprove this theory involve proving that Ryan is actually insane, and that an actual dog named Wilfred really exists outside Ryan's perception, and the anthropomorphized Wilfred really is just part of Ryan's own mind.  But how could this be done?  If Ryan is actually crazy he would have to have a moment of lucidity and see some proof that a canine Wilfred actually exists, but we the audience only ever see anything from Ryan's perspective.  Similarly in Fight Club, the audience is never shown Tyler's true manifestation as the Narrator until the last few scenes when we are shown the Narrator battling with himself to prevent the bombings.

Things that make me not convinced of my own theory include all the crazy shit Ryan's been experiencing.  Of course, he *has* been taking psychedelics non-stop since the beginning of the show.  And then there is the sheer unbelievable difficulty level of actually orchestrating such an enormous con, regardless of the wealth and power wielded by Ryan's father.  So many people would have to play their part perfectly, without deviation.  Who put up the dry-wall in front of the stairwell to Ryan's basement?

Most confusing of all is Wilfred's ostensible Taoist benevolence, and his apparently genuine interest in Ryan's ultimate well-being. If Wilfred really is just the main pawn in Ryan's father's twisted con game, but he's actually good, then perhaps he is secretly attempting to subvert Ryan's father's plans by gradually equipping Ryan with the psychological tools required by anyone to convince oneself of one's own sanity, so that Ryan is prepared to go to battle with his father when the time comes.

Then again, Occam's Razor, Ryan's just nuts and the pills caused him to hallucinate Wilfred."	t5_2sl2e	True

No matter which episode you watch, there is only one explanation for audience. Wilfred is a just a manifestation of Ryan's subconscious. It's simple and obvious. When i saw the episode named Avodiance, i noticed something. James said that Ryan's father will do anything to get him back. I think it's the first foreshadowing for the series finale. Wilfred and his lessons are just a show from Ryan's father. It's all acting. Like Truman Show. Or The Game. Yeah, it looks ridiculous but keep reading.

When i re-watched second season premiere then hit me. ''Dreams are the way our subconscious communicates with us.'' Exactly! Ryan says his father doesn't have authority to do this. All this Wilfred thing. It's not ethic. And Ryan says his doctor actually Robin Williams. Ryan's subconscious trying to say himself this all just an act maybe?


And here is a another one. In the first episode Wilfred says Ryan's father was right  about Ryan's cowardice . If Wilfred is just a Ryan's imagination, how can he know that something Ryan doesn't know? Maybe he's just an actor hired by Hank Newman. To give Ryan lessons about life. Another example of this on the third episode. Wilfred says that Ryan's neighbor is coming back. How can Ryan know about this? How can a dog communicate with Ryan like this?

I think it's all obvious.

Probably doesn't make sense, but I'll try to explain, Take the Hospice episode, where Ryan and Wilfred volunteer at a hospice and Wilfred goes around stealing meds and killing old people for fame. Now, try to think of how that ACTUALLY happened.  
  
  
Old people dying, and Wilfreds presence at each death, is probably just a phenomenon like the Cat predicting 42 deaths or w/e they kept alluding too, which is why the media wanted to cover it, its a rare story!  
  
Ryan could have possibly been stealing the old peoples meds after swiping the black nurses ID, given his knowledge of the missing meds before having the knowledge that the black lady was accused of stealing them. OR The black lady actually did steal them, and Ryan being paranoid, imagined a backstory for Wilfred.  
 
I think the latter is more probable because after the black nurses confrontation about the missing meds, she commits suicide, leaving me to believe, she too, was severely depressed after having lost her family in Haiti (they add these subtle facts in for some reason...RIGHT?) and was stealing the meds for abuse/suicide, or the confrontation put her over the edge, and she commited suicide out of fear/guilt/depression.  

But of course, the main story line has you believe a dog is going around killing old people, and pushing black ladies off of roofs. So far, I have failed to find an episode (atleast in Season 1) that doesnt have a more realistic view on the situation, and we just get to see how Ryan's anxiety and paranoia distorts reality to him."	t5_2sl2e	True

1362779860.0	19xqb2	Is Wilfred just Brian's Tulpa?	Dyfan	3	1	4	I went on 4chan and discovered something called a Tulpa. A tulpa is believed to be an autonomous consciousness which also exists in a self imposed hallucinatory body, which is usually much of your choice. A tulpa is entirely sentient and in control of its opinions, feelings, movements. Basically, it's an imaginary friend that has its own power of will, like it has its own conscience. I looked on Google and apparently if you have a Tulpa for long enough, your brain will create a hallucination and you'll be able to SEE it. So a Tulpa is like an imaginary friend that you can SEE. And I was wondering, did Brian just make a Tulpa when he was young, but his brain blocked it out when he grew up and because he tried to commit suicide, it came back because he needed help?	t5_2sl2e	True

1342043004.0	weo4v	Wilfred Literally Saved My Life (Beware: Text Only)	Mr_Billo	4	2	1	"This is hard to talk about which is why I just now am.  A while ago my girlfriend broke up with me because ""even though she was still in love with me she wanted the chance to not have to answer to a boss, her mom, or a boyfriend"".  But since we still lived together it was torture.  We also worked at the same debt collections place (which was shit enough as it is) but I had to see her there.  Eventually all the emotional pain built up.  I wanted out.  You know what I mean.

Every morning it would get harder and harder not to do it.  One of those days I decided, on a whim really, to check out the show *Wilfred* because it had Elijah Wood in it and it seemed like a cool premise.  And much to my surprise, the character of Ryan was just like me.  He had all the problems I had in my life.  And Wilfred, in teaching Ryan these lessons, taught me these lessons... especially the ending of the episode ""Letting Go"", which helped me see that if my ex needed this time to be young or whatever the fuck her deal was then I should let her and not try to hold her back just because I wanted to still be with her.

I had moved out to Las Vegas from Iowa for the sole purpose of being with her, and now I've moved back.  ""Guilt"" will be the first ep I watch back in Iowa, and I can't wait.

I think in episode 5, Amanda says ''You mean, your place''. We still haven't see her place, i think when we see, it will be end of the relationship. Also in last episode James said ''Your father will do anything to get you back'' Season finale could be on that.

Next episode focusing on Amanda and Ryan. Also featuring Bruce. Which David Zuckerman call that episode. A game changer, definitely a mind-fuck. Also written by David Zuckerman. So i think it's gonna be best episode of the series.

1376620890.0	1kgoxh	Why do people feel the need to continue to post the most boring theory of the show? (Spoilers)	bearsex	1	2	9	"We all know it might be in Ryan's head. They've been telling us that since the first episode. It's not like anyone didn't catch on to that. So there is no need to keep posting the same theory. At this point in the show it seems a little ridiculous for them to go back on these new developments and use such a simple ending. 

We know Wilfred has memories of the past that Ryan wasn't able to experience. So that means Wilfred has been ""alive"" longer than Ryan. 

The drawing might be a curve ball. Kristen may have just had an imaginary friend the resembles Wilfred. But I assume there is more to it then that. 

Either way, with Wilfred potentially existing in Kristen or Ryan's past, and Wilfred retaining memories from his past, I think it's safe to say that Ryan didn't just break down after his suicide attempt.

1374733314.0	1j0gj9	How can anyone actually think that Wilfred is actually more than just the symptom of a mental illness?	greenglasses2	4	5	6	"I have been reading this subreddit and there seems to be quite a few people that think that Wilfred (the one that talks) is real.

Wilfred the dog that barks and licks his own balls is very real but Wilfred the human is just how Ryan sees the dog because he suffers from a severe mental illness that is transmitted genetically too. 

The guy clearly suffers from some kind of schizophrenia -and Ryan the shy lawyer is probably not the only personality in his head.


I mean...what else do people expect wilfred to be? an alien? magical creature?


A lot of people will say ""green hippo""

I will say ""Ryan is mentally ill"", what you and I consider normal or the way we form memories is quite different than how mentally illed people do.

For all we know, Ryan made up the memory about the green hippo after he found it on the box.

The guy is crazy scary.

Kidnaps cat, break ins, etc etc 

I love this show.

I found the character of Wilfred was diluted in the American version, in fact more than that it was a totally different character.

1373565773.0	1i3fzz	I don't think anyone on this subreddit watches this show (spoilers?)	collinc2343	5	6	4	"I'm being completely serious here. The images on the screen may be in front of your eyes and the sound may be entering your ears but you are not watching this show. I cannot believe how many people still say Wilfred is in Ryan's head. 

1. This show is not that simple. 
2. THEY ADDRESSED THIS IN S03E01!!

From 99% of the posts I see here people say ""He's either a magical creature or he's in Ryan's head."" The brilliance of S03E01 is that tested both of those hypothesis and both were proved wrong. Period. End of story. He's not just in Ryan's head and he's not just a magical creature. Find another theory because those are wrong. If you need, watch S03E01 over and over and over again until you get it in your heads. 

Wilfred only being in Ryan's head is only in your head.

Another thing, this show has brilliant writing. Stop insulting the show with theories like ""ryan will turn into an ax murderer by the end of season 3"" and ""Wilfred is ryans dad."" You're not giving the writers proper credit.

This show is not cliche or predicable. Stop trying to turn it into Two and a Half Men or whatever predictable shitty show that it is you watch. 

Now that being said, I have seen an occasional comment that isn't completely inane. I may not be addressing you with this post. Unless you said Ryan is going to turn into an ax murderer, fuck that guy. "	t5_2sl2e	True
