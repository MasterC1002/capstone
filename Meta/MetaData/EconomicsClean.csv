1274836076.0	c84bp	How real-world corruption works.	corruption101	1787	486	643	"This is a throwaway account (I'm a longtime redditor under another login). /r/economics might not be the correct place to put this, but it was the best I could think of. I'm a mid-career guy in a business that does a lot of work with governmental and quasi-governmental agencies. I've never ripped anyone off personally, but I have seen and occasionally been an incidental beneficiary of quite a bit of patronage, insider dealing, nepotism, misuse of taxpayer money, and outright corruption. While I have always been honest in my own dealings on a case-by-case basis, I have refrained from many opportunities to be a ""whistleblower"".

A lot of stuff on reddit misunderstands the relationships between wealth, power, and influence. For starters, all the above three are always and have always been inter-related, and probably always will be. And that might not always be a bad thing: those who have risen to high levels of wealth are often pretty smart, and surprisingly often exceptionally honest. Those who rise to high levels of influence usually have some pretty good insight and talent in their area of expertise. Those who have acquired a lot of power tend to be good at accomplishing things that lots of people want to see happen. 

None of which is purely democratic, nor even purely meritocratic, but there is a certain dose of both kind of baked into the cake: stuff like wealth or family connections only gets you so far in modern, developed, and relatively open and transparent societies such as the US. And while that can be pretty far by normal standards, at some point sunlight does shine through any crack, and outright robbery or complete incompetence is difficult to sustain indefinitely.

But there is an awful lot of low-level waste, patronage, and corruption that happens both in the private and in the public sector. 

Without going ideological, the private sector in a free-ish market has a more immediate system of checks and balances if only because you have to actually persuade the end users to keep buying your stuff for the price you're charging: if it's no good, or if you are grossly over-charging, your customers will tend to catch on sooner or later. 

But in the public sector, the ""consumer"" often has little choice... so-called ""market discipline"" is a lot more diffuse when you have a former-schoolteacher-or-real-estate-broker-turned city councilman whose job it is to disburse a multi-million-dollar street-paving contract or whatever. And neither the schoolteacher nor the real-estate broker has any clue how to write or evaluate a road-paving contract...

Let's say that there are three credible bidders for that street-paving contract: 

* Bidder 1 is ""Paver Joe"", a local guy with a driveway-paving company and three trucks who sees this as a big opportunity to expand his business and get the city to pay for five new trucks. He puts in a dirt-cheap bid that he wrote up himself with the help of his estate attorney. The cost to taxpayers is very low, but the certainty that he will complete it on schedule and as specified is a little iffy. Paver Joe plans to work overtime and bust his tail on the job, not for profits, but to grow his business. He's offering the taxpayers a great deal, but a slightly risky one.

* Bidder 2 is ""Muni Paver Inc"", a company who has the experience and expertise to do the job, who knows what's involved and who has done this work before. They already have the trucks, their workers are all unionized and paid ""prevailing wage"", everything will be done by the book, all their EPA certifications are in place, etc... The bid is a lot more expensive than Paver Joe, but it's credible and reliable. They are offering the taxpayers a degree of certainty and confidence that Paver Joe cannot match.

* Bidder 3 is me, ""Corruptocorp"". Instead of Paver Joe's 2-page contract with typos, or Muni-Paving's 20-page contract, I'm offering the city council a full package of videos, brochures, and a 40-page contract with a price just a tad higher than Paver Joe (my quoted price is meaningless, as we will see). Moreover, I'm inviting the city council to Corruptocorp-owned suites in a golf resort near my headquarters to give my presentation (all expenses paid, of course, and of course, bring your spouses). There the city council members will, after the first day of golf, dinner, dancing, and cocktails, see a slideshow and chorus-line of smiling multi-ethnic faces and working mothers talking about how much Corruptocorp's paving improved their town and their lives. I'll then stand up and tell a self-effacing joke about being one of those corporate guys trying to get their money, and then I'll wax a bit emotional about my small-town roots and how Corruptocorp was started by a man with a simple dream to make life better for everyone, and to do well by doing good in local communities, and that we actually plan to hire local contractors such as Joe's Paving to do the work, backed our economies of scale and reliability. I'll mention that paragraph 32 subsection B of our proposal mandates twice-yearly performance reviews by the city council, to of course be held at the golf resort, at Corruptocorp's expense, (""so I hope to see you all back here every February and August!""), and of course I make sure that each of them has my ""personal"" cell phone and home numbers in case they have any questions....

So needless to say I get the bid, and six months later it's time for our review at the golf resort. After dinner and cocktails I step up to the podium and announce that there is both good news and bad news: 

*""The bad news is that our subcontractor has found over 1,000 rocks in the road. And as I'm sure you know, paragraph 339 subsection D.12 specifies that any necessary rock removal will be done at prevailing wages, currently $1,500 per rock, for a total cost overrun of $1.5 million. But the good news is (and believe me, I had to fight long and hard for this with the board of directors), Corruptocorp has agreed to remove those rocks for only $1,000 apiece! So even though there have been some cost overruns, your smart decisions have saved your taxpayers **half a million dollars**! Give yourselves a round of applause!""*

*""Now, the other situation is that there has been some 'difficult terrain' as described in subsection 238b, which I'm sure you're all familiar with.  And as you know, 'difficult terrain' is not covered by the contract, which is for paving, not for turning mountains into flat roads... (wistful chuckle). Now, technically, according to the contract, we should be charging your town prevailing rates for these sections, but I've worked it so that you will be allowed to re-bid them, if you wish, since our contract doesn't specifically include terrain as described in subsection 238b.""*

Now the contract price has doubled, and Corruptocorp has completely sidestepped all of the difficult and costly work, taking profits only on the easy stuff. The city council members can either admit that they were duped and bought (political suicide), or can simply feed corruptocorp's line to the voters. Which do you think will happen?

And it gets even worse on smaller scales: look up your local building or electrical inspector. Ten-to-one he is a relative, friend, or campaign donor to the mayor or city council. What's in it for him? Every single construction or home improvement project not only has to pay him a fee, it also has to pass his inspection. Guess which contractors are most likely to pass his inspection? His brothers, friends, family... or the cheapest guy who for some reason has a hard time finding work in this town? Guess how the local inspector feels about homeowner self-improvements: does he think they are a great way for regular people to improve their wealth with a little elbow grease, or does he see them as stealing work from his friends and family? 

The US military is by far the most wasteful customer I've ever had. I'll talk about that if this topic gets any interest. 

edit: as promised, here's the post about military spending:

1291305027.0	ef2iw	"Who else understands that ""taxing the rich"" does not mean penalizing small business?  Most business costs, including wages are expenses and not taxed!"	Trace	1304	687	793	"People seem to think that small business ""job creators"" will be taxed out of existence if taxes for the wealthy are raised, or technically, returned to the higher rates.  But, what actually happens is that nearly every penny a business spends to conduct its business is an expense and is not taxable at all.  That means inventory, operating expenses, insurance, wages, other taxes etc. are not taxed.

To give an example:  a small business on some main street pulls in $500,000/year.  She pays $250,000 on inventory, $50,000 in operating expenses such as rent, utilities, maintenance, insurance, fees, advertisement, supplies and so on, and pays a total of say $150,000 for wages for 6 employees.  She is not taxed on any of that money!  If she takes all the profits for herself that year, she would be paying herself $50,000 ($500,000 minus inventory costs, operating expenses and wage expenses).  Even then she gets standard deductions and exemptions for herself and her family.  If she has four people in her family maybe $15,000 will be exempted, and she would pay taxes on only $35,000...a far cry from the $250,000 bracket.

tldr:
Out of $500,000 revenue for instance, the taxable amount to the small business owner(s) is a small fraction after all the expenses are deducted.


EDIT:  Great Conversation all!  Lots of clarification in the threads and a lot of nonsense and stupidity too lol.  
1.  Yes the inventory cost is incorrect in my example, it should also include how much inventory was left at the end of the year, and that amount is considered an asset and might be taxed.

The US has the world's largest economy by country, clocking in at almost $14 Trillion nominal GDP.* This is estimated to be nearly *three times* as large as the next largest economy, China ($4.9T). Though, Chinese economic data is heavily fucked with by the government, so it's hard to know for sure.

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States :
&gt;  It has been the world's largest national economy since 1944 and remains the world's largest manufacturer, representing 19% of the world's manufacturing output.

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China :
&gt; Industry and construction account for 46.8[90]% of China's GDP. Around 8% of the total manufacturing output in the world comes from China itself.

It's definitely possible that our economy is screwed, that we're all going to die in the poor-house, broke and bereft of hope. But, on the other hand, this would require a massive and sudden shift in global economics. 

I understand that economics is complicated, but it's not hard to look up some basic data on wikipedia. Let's try to keep things in perspective, ok?

Answer beautifully illustrates the difficulties with the Efficient Market Hypothesis.	smullaney	616	192	286	"Edit: Sorry forgot to mention investors asked to choose a number between **0 and 100**

Response frequency provided here:

[http://imgur.com/bbaDc.jpg](http://imgur.com/bbaDc.jpg)

The highest possible correct answer is 67. To go for 67 you have to believe that every other muppet in the known universe has just gone for 100. The fact we got a whole raft of responses above 67 is more than slightly alarming. 

You can see spikes which represent various levels of thinking. The spike at fifty reflects what we (somewhat rudely) call level zero thinkers. They are the investment equivalent of Homer Simpson, 0, 100, duh 50! Not a vast amount of cognitive effort expended here! 

There is a spike at 33 - of those who expect everyone else in the world to be Homer. 

There's a spike at 22, again those who obviously think everyone else is at 33. 

As you can see there is also a spike at zero. Here we find all the economists, game theorists and mathematicians of the world. They are the only people trained to solve these problems backwards. And indeed the only stable Nash equilibrium is zero (two-thirds of zero is still zero). However, it is only the 'correct' answer when everyone chooses zero. 

The final noticeable spike is at one. These are economists who have (mistakenly...) been invited to one dinner party (economists only ever get invited to one dinner party). They have gone out into the world and realised the rest of the world doesn't think like them. So they try to estimate the scale of irrationality. However, they end up suffering the curse of knowledge (once you know the true answer, you tend to anchor to it). 

In this game, which is fairly typical, the average number picked was 26, giving a two-thirds average of 17. Just three people out of more than 1000 picked the number 17. 

I play this game to try to illustrate just how hard it is to be just one step ahead of everyone else - to get in before everyone else, and get out before everyone else. Yet despite this fact, it seems to be that this is exactly what a large number of investors spend their time doing.

This article happens to say the same thing and here's why...	FritzGuy	715	347	187	"Edit: I've gotten a lot of snarky remarks about ""Go ahead, vote it down"" in the title. If I could change it, I would. But being the 40th person to say ""Voted down because you ask me to"" does not make you funny or clever. Moving on...

The TL;DR version:

Money is no longer the bottleneck in saving lives. Much of the money donated at this stage will line the pockets of NGO administrations or be stockpiled for a future crisis. Pouring extra money into charity aid right now, we risk increases local corruption and stalling legitimate economic recovery, plus charity donations to Haiti made today will likely never get there. What needs to happen now is direct international investment in Haiti's infrastructure.

All of this is from a source who's most recent job title was ""Country Director"" of an international emergency relief program.

This (unrelated) article says the same thing, from a different author. http://solarcrash.com/2010/01/stop-donating-to-haiti/
Both authors choose anonymity because it's highly unpopular to tell people to stop donating, and even less popular to tell people that their donated money could be wasted.

1276125270.0	cdbqu	The net present value of college	Will_Power	491	164	331	"Several recent posts have discussed the value of college.  Unfortunately, many of those discussions were mired down in the relative value of a degree in women's studies versus engineering.  I thought it worthwhile to consider college in terms of investment for a population level data set.  The data source for this analysis can be found here:
http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p28.html

From that data set, I extracted earnings information for full time, year round workers for those with a high school diploma (or equivalent) only and those with a bachelor's degree but no higher degree.  Note that this is earnings, not income.  The rationale for choosing earnings and the high school and bachelor's degree cohorts is that these choices best control for the earnings premium provided by a college degree.

I then constructed a synthesis much like those used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics by listing age ranges for each cohort, and the earnings reported during that range and for that level of education.

As expected, the sum of the lifetime earnings differed by about $1,000,000.  However, when I discounted future earnings and factored in the cost of college, things became very interesting.  I chose a discount rate of 6%, something typical of a mortgage, and a cost of college of $10,000 per year for five years.  The net present value of college in this scenario is just over $147,000 for over an earnings lifetime:

http://imgur.com/zfJLB.png

I then changed the variables to 8.25% for the discount rate (the student loan cap) and increased the cost of college to $20,000 per year (not unreasonable considering that the cost of college has outpaced inflation for the last generation).  In this scenario the NPV has fallen to $9,338.38 over a lifetime:

http://imgur.com/wMP6j.png

Increasing the cost of college or the discount rate even a little beyond this makes the NPV negative.

Most disturbingly, the educational premium seems to be decreasing over time.  The ratio of earnings of those with a degree to those with no college has fallen from almost two for the oldest working group to less than 1.5 for the youngest working group:

http://imgur.com/JVngw.png

If the synthesis were remade with a ratio as is typical for young people today, the NPV of college would be even lower.

Since financial institutions can transfer bad student loans to the federal government without taking a loss, I can't see rising student loan defaults causing a financial crisis like we saw in 2008.  This situation seems like it would compound the sovereign debt crisis, but I don't think it will wreck the financial industry like the real estate bubble.  

However, this situation does appear to cause other problems.  As of now, people can't lessen their student loan debt through bankruptcy.  Even after the bad loans are transferred to the federal government, those students are still on the hook for paying the government back over their lifetime.  So what we seem to have here is a generation of students having to pay much more for tuition with bleak job prospects after graduation.  In essence, these people will be paying back the government for many years and will have less money left over to buy other goods and services, or to save/invest for retirement.  This situation seems destined to result in an economic standstill relative to the present amount of economic activity if nothing is done.

AN INQUIRY INTO THE NATURE AND CAUSES OF THE WEALTH OF NATIONS.

By Adam Smith CHAPTER VIII. OF THE WAGES OF LABOUR. http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm#2HCH0008 ""A man must always live by his work, and his wages must at least be sufficient to maintain him. They must even upon most occasions be somewhat more, otherwise it would be impossible for him to bring up a family, and the race of such workmen could not last beyond the first generation. Mr Cantillon seems, upon this account, to suppose that the lowest species of common labourers must everywhere earn at least double their own maintenance, in order that, one with another, they may be enabled to bring up two children; the labour of the wife, on account of her necessary attendance on the children, being supposed no more than sufficient to provide for herself: But one half the children born, it is computed, die before the age of manhood. The poorest labourers, therefore, according to this account, must, one with another, attempt to rear at least four children, in order that two may have an equal chance of living to that age. But the necessary maintenance of four children, it is supposed, may be nearly equal to that of one man. The labour of an able-bodied slave, the same author adds, is computed to be worth double his maintenance; and that of the meanest labourer, he thinks, cannot be worth less than that of an able-bodied slave. Thus far at least seems certain, that, in order to bring up a family, the labour of the husband and wife together must, even in the lowest species of common labour, be able to earn something more than what is precisely necessary for their own maintenance; but in what proportion, whether in that above-mentioned, or many other, I shall not take upon me to determine. ""

he also believed high rewards for labor were a sure sign of increasing national wealth. ""The liberal reward of labour, therefore, as it is the necessary effect, so it is the natural symptom of increasing national wealth. The scanty maintenance of the labouring poor, on the other hand, is the natural symptom that things are at a stand, and their starving condition, that they are going fast backwards. ""

he also believed in challenging monopolies and what we would call today ""class warfare"" from the same chapter:

""We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters, though frequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject. Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform, combination, not to raise the wages of labour above their actual rate.""

Annecdotal evidence suggests that most people have parts of a calling plan they don't want, or their ISP's ""unlimited internet"" results in them being placed on a fair usage policy and so on. Is this not indicitive of how little sway a consumer has over the market? Why does the law favour this situation, and why have no companies taken steps to address this with simple on point service provision, with no contract and customisable options?

Low taxes, massive government spending, for the past 15 years we have had extremely low interest rates, and now we are stimulating the economy with deficits only seen previously in times of war.

We have used every trick in the book.  There's no more credit to spend, taxes are at an all-time low, interest rates are even ZERO in Japan.  And yet we are barely holding it together (if you consider 10%+ real unemployment ""holding it together"").

Am I wrong to think that this is just a long-due *correction"" back to where the economy would have been with out all this ""stimulating"" bullshit and a couple bubbles (tech, housing)?

Isn't asinine to even aim to get back all those jobs and GDP?  Wouldn't we be better off restructuring for the new (old) economy?

EDIT:
I am not a fatalist.

My point is that through the spending/tax imbalance + low interest rates we have essentially enacted a $15T stimulus over the past 30 years (actually bigger, when you adjust for inflation over those years).

We don't have these tools at our disposal at the moment:  We can't lower taxes (deficit Vs cuts to existing services in a weak economy).  We can't spend more (deficit is too high, plus we are in danger of either default OR other nations not buying our debt).  We can't cut interest rates.

I don't believe that the GOP will back off on tax cuts until we see 7%+ GDP for 4 quarters, and then they (and Wall Street) will freak out when we try to adjust them back.

I don't think the Dems will drop stimulus spending until we see 4-6% unemployment.

What if those numbers are not possible without the deficit spending combined with low taxes/interest rates of the past 30 years?  Would it not be better to recognize that and try to adjust our policies to reflect that?  (That's the ""New"" economy I am talking about).  This is not fatalist, this is pragmatism, no?

Personally, I don't have a lot of faith in Washington or the general public to deal with this.  I guess you could call this fatalist."	t5_2qh1s	True
