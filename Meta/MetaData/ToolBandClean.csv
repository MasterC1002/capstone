* The Diddler is a provocative title for a bottle of wine. Is it autobiographical?
* You've mentioned in some 1998 interview that the first time you imbibed wine was transcendant. Would you expand on that a little for me?
* I've heard that if I drink the wine backwards--or ""throw it up,"" if you will--it tastes completely different. Do you worship Satan?
* When's the new bottle coming out?

Sorry if this is a little too /r/circlejerk-ish. I was thinking about why MJK would rather talk about wine, and this is where I ended up.

1 mile = 5,280 feet = 63,360 inches = 10,560 Maynard dicks

So, you'd have to slide on Maynard's dick 10,560 times to go a mile. That would probably get you pretty familiar with Tool's tool, but how long would that take? Assuming Maynard was thrusting at a speed of about 2 thrusts per second (a moderately vigorous pace for a mile's worth of fucking), and that a full thrust would constitute 2 dick lengths (once forward and once back);

10,560 Maynard dicks = 5,280 thrusts = 2,640 seconds = 44 minutes

So, to go the distance on Keenan's cream cannon, one would have to spend about 45 minutes making love to Maynard. Who's up for it? ...ladies? "	t5_2rfjf	True

As you all know, the meaning of the song goes along the lines of Americans living ""vicariously "" through the media and bringing their own esteem up with reports of tragedy or deaths.

As I watched multiple news outlets keep reiterating that, "" it could've been worse"", I found myself sickened and repeating words from the song in my head. People died and lost limbs, why do we as a society seem to get almost thrilled when crisis strikes? ""Eye on the TV, cuz tragedy thrills me.""

And some of the questions these ignorant anchors or reporters were asking were astonishing to me. I recall one on CNN yesterday ask a witness literally one hour after the attack, ""will you run in the Marathon next year?"" 

""Vicariously I live, while the whole world dies."" Truer words haven't been spoken about our society and our reactions to tragedy, and it's unfortunate."	t5_2rfjf	True

It's in relation to the song Jambi, and this is my interpretation of the song. Other than that, just read the whole damn post.

Alright. As per request, here are the pictures for the entire series (along with original sketches). 

**This is the link for the street art album**
http://imgur.com/a/A9qB2#0

**under each piece piece on the album i gave a description along with the song lyrics, in case it's too difficult to read the lyrics from the photo themselves**

First things first, for those who may not know for whatever reason (new tool fans?) this is based off the song Jambi on the album 10,000 days. I divided up the song into 11 different sections to which I created a corresponding piece of art. Each piece was created based on what I thought fit best to each line. Mostly however, they're images that are products of my mild synesthesia and what would come to me while doodling. These pieces aren't just random doodles without any real connection between them, but I'll get more into that later.

If you haven't actually listened to the song and know what Maynard is talking about, then I'd do so. It's my favorite song by them, and it's one of the songs he's written that I can relate to the most. For those of you not willing to decipher the message behind the song and the life of Maynard, I think this gives a pretty good  idea of at least the thematic points he makes in this song. Read this with a grain of salt, it's not necessarily how I interpreted the song, it's just useful for giving yourself a jumping off point. I have no actual clue what Maynard is singing about. I'm not here to debate that. (However, my art is completely inspired off of my own artistic inspiration and what I can relate to.)

http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=6298 

What I interpret this song to be:
We all make mistakes. But to a greater degree, we understand the mistakes were making, yet will still choose to carry them out. We put ourselves in a position that we know is going to have negative consequence. Essentially, we create misery for ourselves, and in the end we question our own judgment and what the hell we were thinking. Sometimes we gamble away things that are more important than we think, and we ending losing a part of ourselves. That's just what I interpret Maynard's words to mean.

For me, at least personally, I can relate to this.

If you've looked at all the pieces, then you realized I've dedicated the last piece to a Mr. Jeff Cooney, who died within the last few months. He was a friend of mine and the former boyfriend of one of my closest friends (let's call her “Jen” for the sake of the story). Jen and Jeff have/had both battled their own demons. Severe depression, anxiety, abuse from parents, self inflicted injuries, and multiple suicide attempts. They met in high school and dated up until they went to college. In the least cliché and most literal way possible, they completed each other.  and for the most part, kept the other alive and function both physically and mentally. I'm sure I don't need to elaborate further using metaphors and whatnot for you to understand that they were simply a good match for each other.

This story becomes very personal, and there is a lot to it that I'm choosing to leave out for privacy reasons. I'm sorry if it detracts from the overall message, but please understand. 

When college rolled around, they ended up separating from each other and going to different colleges to pursue different interests. They attempted to maintain a long distance relationship, but it only caused a bigger divide between them and only added to the shit pile of mental disorders that each had to deal with. Jen decided to break things off, hoping that it would help dissolve some of the stress and help simmer things down. Everyone close to Jen (including myself) told her she was doing the right thing. However, I'm being completely honest when I say that deep down, we knew it was going to only make things worse. But that's not what we wanted to believe. Things were simply easier this way.

However, things got much worse. The already monumental shit pile of mental issues and stress did not cease to grow exponentially. Jeff, to a large degree needed this more than Jen did. Jeff was not surrounded by people who knew him or understood his problems. Between all the bullshit, drama, pills, fights, and trips to the psychiatrist, Jeff took his life on the evening of December 7th.

You're simply not seeing the story from the right perspective if haven't already assumed that Jen now regrets ever leaving him in the first place. If things weren't already bad as they could be, Jeff's parent's originally blamed Jen for his suicide and forbade her to go to his wake or funeral. I remember she called me the night after it happened saying something along the lines of “I just wish this would all go away”.

And again, remember there's a lot I've left out of the story. None of it's good news, however.

I've put myself in similar positions and made mistakes that to this day I still haven't forgiven myself for, but you probably wouldn't care to hear about them, and more importantly, they didn't inspire my art at this level. We've all made these mistakes, but I can't imagine Jen's pain.

There is an inner connection between all the pieces. There's a story that each one follows, and that relate to the song. However, I'm not going to explain this part of the series. I'll leave that up to the individual to interpret. But there's a reason why the series starts with the boy with box on his head (and yes, this is inspired from the cover of “running with scissors”, however that has no connection to the art). I'll leave you with that.

Also, I understand that people may not like what I've done. There are going those people. They may think the story's cliché or stupid, or I've killed the song for them, or maybe I'm just a bad artist/writer/interpreter. Well, to that I say fuck you. This is something I feel strongly about. And I got out there and created something of it. If you don't like it,  go out and do it yourself.

1338013113.0	u5oyl	Rosetta Stoned	MorphotheDragon	103	6	63	"I'm a bit ashamed to say 10,000 Days is the one Tool album I've kind of overlooked this whole time I've been into them. Sure, it was a great album, and I loved a lot of the tracks, but it didn't quite have the same pull like Ænima or Lateralus do for me. So I decided I'd look at it a bit more in-depth recently, song-by-song... and in so doing I not only rediscovered just how much of a killer record this is, but I also discovered what is now among my all-time favorite songs: Rosetta Stoned.

I've seen a lot of people on this subreddit talk about how awesome of a track it is, and it made me realize I really wasn't familiar enough with it to be able to agree or disagree. So I decided I'd just devote some time to listening to that one track... and I don't have the slightest idea how, in all the times I'd listened to the whole album, that song just flew under the radar, because it's *so good.* It's like... play it on repeat and just get lost in it and absorb all the details good.

It's an outstanding piece of music -- it's a work of art. It's got power, but it has subtlety. I love hearing all the fine details -- Maynard's different vocal styles, the time changes, the instrumentation, and the lyrics. It all works together to form a powerful track that also manages to conjure up some wonderful surreal thoughts and imagery without being overtly psychedelic. I'm so glad I gave this track a chance to shine on its own, because it's utterly fantastic.

I find this happens now and then with Tool -- a particular track, one day and for whatever reason, will jump out and impress the hell out of me out of nowhere. Such is the case with Rosetta Stoned, and such was the case also with Third Eye, Pushit, Intolerance, Flood, The Grudge, Jambi... I could go on and on. And to me, that's the mark of a truly great band: their music continues to impress you regardless of how often you listen to it because you continue to find something new about it that maybe you overlooked before, or you learn something new about it that gives you a greater depth of understanding or sense of appreciation for it.

Just thought I'd share that."	t5_2rfjf	True

NOW, WHERE WERE WE? 

For those who like to keep tabs on every specific aspect involving TOOL, yesterday, around 2:00 PM (PST), a truck containing the band's equipment (which had earlier arrived from Australia and Japan via a transpacific freighter) pulled up to their primary storage space where it was unloaded by several able bodies. Afterwards, the truck proceeded to the band's rehearsal space (""the loft""), where what gear remained was dropped off. Therefore, according to the plan, the guys are scheduled to resume with the writing/arranging process of material for their next record sometime later this afternoon - once everything is put back into place, and they have had their lunch (which I'm guessing will be sandwiches of some kind from a nearby delicatessen). At least that's the plan. Stay tuned for further updates."	t5_2rfjf	True

1329023425.0	plq00	So Maynard spoke in Phoenix tonight...		76	3	26	"My fellow [/r/toolband](/r/toolband) redditor, CosmicLobster and I met to listen to Maynard speak at the AZ Centennial celebration (woohoo!!) in downtown Phoenix. 

About 50 people were there, most of them were very vocal about seeing Maynard. He was indeed the highlight of the evening for a lot of people.  MJK's presentation was pretty intimate. He spoke of motivation, namely that of being moved and growing up as a kid in a new town. What stood out most was the fact that he spoke about a '3-part harmony' of his head, his heart, and his gut feeling. His speech was very moving, and very inspiring. 

He then moved into his reasoning for moving to Jerome, his vision in a dream of seeing a big city (Los Angeles) being obliterated, and seeing a small town on the side of a hill. That town is Jerome, and his description of it as his 'soulmate' (he compared it to that), was very interesting.

He ended by quoting a song from his project, Puscifer. He quoted [""The Humbling River""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIjUtzWrCeA) in the context of sustainability, and working hard with less and making more out of it. He made it a point to say that his wines, and his winemaking can't be shipped to China, it can't be outsourced to Mexico, it is really and truly about the state of Arizona. 

It was a fantastic experience to listen to him speak, see a human side of the person that usually is back by Danny Carey on stage.  He mentioned he was nervous and it was visible by his hands trembling at times when he read his notes.

I've got no doubt that Tool is a special band, but MJK's appearance was very inspiring to me personally.

If anyone went, I'd like to hear what you thought of it.

If any of you have been to a Tool, A Perfect Circle, or Puscifer concert, you'll know how the 'average' fan treats Maynard. That's no slight against of you fine folks in this subreddit, but just walk through a crowd at a concert of the aforementioned bands and you'll know what I'm talking about... You'll hear whispers everywhere of, ""I heard Maynard is like this..."" or ""Some guy told me this story about Maynard..."" or ""Maynard is a GOD."" Of course they're doing all of this while getting wasted and acting like douchebags, while screaming out ""MAYNARD OH MY GOD!!!"" every fifteen seconds. And they're not exaggerating. Some people really treat Maynard like some sort of demigod, I've experienced plenty of these people first hand. I'm a fan of many other bands, and I've never really experienced this type of behavior anywhere else.

Now, I know Maynard has said that people listen to his music and don't ""get"" it. They listen and listen, but they don't hear what he's saying. As arrogant as it sounds, this is how he seems to feel. We all know he's not too fond of Tool fans in general, saying things like, [*""[You play] heavy music, and your record company, which has never owned an album anything like what you're doing, immediately markets you to the obvious stinky kid with the dreadlocks and the B.O. and the urine on his shoes because he's been sleeping in his own filth in a festival in the middle of the rain. They basically market right to that guy. And then you realize the only people showing up to your shows are those primates—these weird, cretin people…""*](http://www.avclub.com/articles/maynard-james-keenan,14038/)

So... we've established that many Tool fans treat Maynard like a demigod. And we've established that Maynard thinks Tool fans don't ""get"" Tool or ""listen"" to what he saying. Can you see where I'm going with this?

Let's begin with the song.

&gt;10 to 2am, X, Yogi D.M.T, and a box of Krispy Kremes in my 'need-to-know' pose, just outside of Area 51, contemplating the whole 'Chosen People' thing,

We all know the Tool fanbase is no stranger to psychedelics. Go to any Tool show, and you'll be accosted by hippies trying to sell you acid or shrooms or E or whatever. Then, once you get inside, you'll see countless people tripping balls and gyrating as if an angel just gave them a full-body orgasm.

&gt;just when a flaming stealth banana split the sky like one would hope, but never really expect, to see in a place like this. Cutting right-angle donuts on a dime and stopping right at my Birkenstocks, and me yelping, ""Holy Fucking Shit!""

You know what sort of vehicle looks like a banana? Maybe... a tour bus? And who would get out of a tour bus?

&gt;Then the X-Files being (some kind of blue-green Jackie Chan with Isabella Rosallini lips, and breath that reaked of vanilla Chig Champa) did a slow-mo Matrix descent out of the butt-end of the banana vessel and hovered above my bug-eyes, my gaping jaw, and my sweaty L. Ron Hubbard upper-lip, and all I could think was, ""I hope Uncle Martin here doesn't notice that I pissed my fucking pants.""

So these people who treat Maynard like a literal Superman, how do you think they'd react to meeting him? Would they stay calm and composed, or would they figuratively piss their pants?

&gt;""Fuck me. It's gotta be The Deadhead Chemistry. This blotter got right on top of me. Got me seeing E-motherfucking-T.""

""This can't be real. I'm meeting Maynard James fucking Keenan?!""

&gt;And after calming me down with some orange slices and some fetal spooning, E.T. revealed to me his singular purpose. He said, ""You are The Chosen One. The One who will deliver The Message. A Message of Hope for those who choose to hear it, and a Warning for those who do not."" Me? The Chosen One? They chose me.

""It's almost like he's singing just to me in these songs. I'm the only one who really know what they mean.""

&gt;And I didn't even graduate from fucking high school.

*""...those primates—these weird, cretin people...""*

&gt;This is so real. Finally it's my lucky day. See, my heart is racing, because this shit never happens to me!

""I'm meeting Maynard oh my god, I can't wait to tell all my friends!!""

&gt;I'm out of my head. Am I alive? Am I dead?
Can't remember what they said.
God damn. Shit the bed.

""Oh my god, I met Maynard! Too bad I didn't listen to anything the band has said about treating them like gods!""

&gt;It won't help the brain dead.

*""...weird, cretin people...""*

&gt;Don't know. Won't know.

They just won't listen.

Incredible (except I was hoping they'd show Tool as well :P), just watch it. It's on [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/American_The_Bill_Hicks_Story/70126749). I'm posting here because of his influence on Tool.

One of my favorite Bill Hicks' quotes:

They tell us ""Rock'n'roll is the devil's music."" Well, let's say we know that rock is the devil's music, and we know that it is, for sure … At least he fuckin' jams! If it's a choice between eternal Hell and good tunes, and eternal Heaven and New Kids on the fuckin' Block … I'm gonna be surfin' on the lake of fire, rockin' out."	t5_2rfjf	True

To me, Tool's music is an end in itself, to be experienced with my whole mind alert, but at rest. It doesn't compliment my mornings like a bagel, or my afternoons like chewing gum. It populates a landscape in my mind with principal emotions that aesthetically compliment my soul. 

The state of joy i feel when accompanied by their music is more enduring and genuine. It's quality of joy is such at your self esteem rises as you appreciate this chance to ""be alive and breathing,"" and proud enough to recognize this ""holy gift"".

Do you guys know the type? Are YOU that type?

And trust me, we ""get"" what Tool is about. They're our favorite band to the point its annoying for others. We can be at a completely unrelated show and somehow end up getting into a deep conversation about Tool in the middle of an Umphrey's McGee set or something (great band by the way, see em live). But anyway... I bring it up because sometimes it seems like Tool fans seem to forget that concerts are meant to be fun, a chance to get into the show and feel the energy instead of just watching and appreciating 4 guys playing their instruments.

Best Tool show I've been to? Lollapalooza 2009. Not necessarily because of the set list or anything, but more so because the crowd was going absolutely NUTS the entire show to the point it was physically taxing. I always attribute it to the fact that it wasnt a crowd of only Tool fans. I would guess it was a pretty good mix of people who didnt really know Tool, casual Tool fans, and then of course some hardcore fans.

I've been a fan of TOOL (and really Maynard) forever and it's my favorite project he has, dont get me wrong I still dig APC and Puscifer, but I dont get why he's like he is about Tool.  I read on his Twitter once he got fairly pissy about Tool mentions and said something to the effect of respect the project and that he separates one from the other and when he's doing one thing he's so focused on that to the extent that you cant talk to him about any other project.  Now the Rogan chat seemed to center around alot of things, primarily his wine, so I am wondering if that was the reason.  Couple of specifics to the best of my recollection&gt; him dodging somewhat on the fibonnaci sequence in Lateralus, he kind of dodged then came back with something like every song has that in it.  Rogan's co-hort asked him a few Tool and even one APC question and Maynard was a dick about it.  

So my point, anyone else think he could give a shit anymore about Tool?  I am kind of fretting that this upcoming Tool album may be very well the last if up to Maynard.  What do you guys think?

As a teenager I met them multiple times and discussed their music with them.	manziejay	55	8	26	"This is in response to a comment I posted on the Maynard AMA request that's been around in the last day or so. Essentially, I'm an Australian, my parents are divorced and my Dad lives in LA. My Dad's current wife was Maynard's highschool girlfriend in Ohio. When 10,000 days came out he came by the house when I was visiting for a few weeks and dropped off a copy. That's the first time I listened to Tool and I've been a huge fan ever since. He stayed for a while, had tea and caught up with my step-mum and Dad. Obviously I had very little idea of who he was at the time. He was very eloquent with his words though and nice, overall. The next year I visited again and he came over to jam with my dad a bunch of times (also a musician) and I got to discuss a bunch of Tool songs with him. Maynard seems to have this reputation of being an asshole but I saw a very different side of him, we must have talked for at least an hour about a number of tool's songs and their meanings. Being a bit of a fanboy at the time and still quite young you would imagine it being quite invasive but he was very passionate and happy to discuss a lot of the songs with me in detail. Adam I also met on two occasions, although I only talked to him briefly, and not about Tool. I did get to hear him play guitar with my Dad though, and that's about as cool as it gets.
So if any of you have any interest on this I'm more than happy to answer any questions, as I don't feel many people, especially fans, get to see this side of maynard."	t5_2rfjf	True

Does anyone think there's an intentional connection between the songs ""Third Eye"" and ""Rosetta Stoned?"" I've thought this since I first heard the latter, but was wondering if anyone thought the same way. Rosetta Stoned seems to me to be like the brutally cynical, quote-unquote ""realistic"" counterpoint to Third Eye. 

Both the lyrics and the music of the two lead me to believe this:

 *The music*: 

One of the main riffs in Rosetta Stoned, e.g. at 3:00, seems like a callback to the main riff of Third Eye (e.g. at 2:34, when the vocals start) Furthermore, the sound of the pick scraping against the strings with delay under that main riff at 3:00 in Rosetta Stoned seems reminiscent of similar pick scrapings drowned in delay that are often heard in Third Eye such as around 1:50.


*The lyrics*: 

Third Eye is, essentially, the story of a psychonaut adventurer, describing his experience of communication with some alien consciousness, whether it's some sort of spirit thing experienced under a heroic dose of psychedelic drugs, some being from another galaxy, some aspect of the collective unconscious, or perhaps all three at once.

Rosetta Stoned is, essentially, the ravings of a half-crazed lunatic, claiming that he experienced communication with some alien consciousness, quite explicitly under a heroic dose of psychedelic drugs, that he claims to be an ET from another galaxy. And, you know, he says that he was that they chose him to deliver a message (perhaps in the form of some epic, rambling, 15-minute long song?) Despite not graduating from high school, and having a propensity for shitting the bed, and being unable to remember his pen. 

Seems a bit like it's meant to be two sides of the same story. Rosetta Stoned always comes across to me as brutal because it feels almost like a repudiation of the psychedelic hope of Third Eye. It might even be kind of depressing, except that it's obviously all rather tongue-in-cheek, and the song simply rocks, one of my favorite Tool songs of all time.

This is, of course, accompanied by a picture of King Buzzo holding a copy of the album. The band's news page also had the following bizarre post put up yesterday, and I have no idea what it is supposed to be about.

I thought that the joke on fourtheye.net was miles above the official april fools joke. I actually briefly believed the ""Tool Lives"" nonsense and then had a good laugh.

1346273242.0	z1f01	"""Pushit"" lyrics possibly based on a codependent relationship experience? (also ""Sober"")"	cakez_	52	10	23	"For those who don't know what codependency is, here's the definition, pasted from wiki: *""Codependency (or codependence, interdependency ) is defined as a psychological condition or a relationship in which a person is controlled or manipulated by another who is affected with a pathological condition (as in an addiction to alcohol or heroin); and in broader terms, it refers to the dependence on the needs of or control of another. It also often involves placing a lower priority on one's own needs, while being excessively preoccupied with the needs of others. Codependency can occur in any type of relationship, including family, work, friendship, and also romantic, peer or community relationships. Codependency may also be characterized by denial, low self-esteem, excessive compliance, or control patterns. Narcissists are considered to be natural magnets for the codependent.""*

As a recovering codependent after being glued to a drug addict for over 5 years, I could also find myself in this song.

And to give a few examples of lyrics which have the greatest impact on me emotionally:


*""What is this but my reflection? 
Who am I to judge and strike you down?""*
-a codependent is also an addict. The codependent sees their own reflection when they think about their addict significant other, and they feel like they can't judge them for their actions. You know what they do is wrong, but you are doing the same thing at the same time. 

*""Rest your trigger on my finger, 
bang my head upon the fault line.""*
-Addicts usually have the tendency to put the blame on the codependent for everything, because they know that they almost never fight back.

*""I'm alive when you're touching me, alive when you're shoving me down.""*
-Codependency is just like a drug: you need your addict to survive, his/her presence makes you feel alive... even when they bring you down (which happens permanently). You crave peace of mind, but at the same time, you can't get out that loop. For anyone who has experienced this, knows exactly how it feels.

*""If, when I say I may fade like a sigh if I stay,
You minimize my movement anyway,
I must persuade you another way.""*
-The addict clings on you like there's no tomorrow, making the codependent feel bad for any attempt of getting away. So pretty much you are hopeless and helpless.

*""There's no love in fear.""*
-One of the most powerful parts in a song... ever... and as a codependent, I've lived in fear all these years. Fear can make you confuse feelings, therefore being scared for someone permanently and worrying about their well-being could lead you to thinking that you are in love.

*""Remember I will always love you,
As I claw your fucking throat away.""*
-From my own experience, there comes a time when your patience is so drained, seeing the addict treating you badly while your only concern is his/her happiness and well-being leads you to turn against them. I can't really say this is always the case, but I did get to that point.

Also, referring to Sober, there's this part:
*""I am just a worthless liar.
I am just an imbecile.
I will only complicate you.
Trust in me and fall as well.
I will find a center in you.
I will chew it up and leave,
I will work to elevate you
just enough to bring you down""*
-I can imagine these words coming from an addict's subconscious to the ones around them. It's like a warning to a codependent or a soon-to-be-codependent.

So this is just my own interpretation, and I'm wondering if anyone who knows what codependence is/dealt with it or with an addict feels the same.

Edit: Sorry for my eventually broken English here and there, English is not my first language and I'm also very tired at this time.

Edit: I forgot to add ""Bottom"", especially the spoken part: *""-Henry Rollins: If I let you, you would make me destroy myself. But in order to survive you, I must first survive myself. I can sink no further and I cannot forgive you. There's no choice but to confront you, to engage you, to erase you. I've gone to great lengths to expand my threshold of pain. I will use my mistakes against you. There's no other choice. Shameless now. Nameless now. Nothing now. No one now. But my soul must be iron cause my fear is naked. I'm naked and fearless.-""*
I will not lie, this very song helped me through my battle with codependency, it helped me see over and over again that I can't help him no matter what I do, and I will only manage to destroy myself and sink with him in the process. I must add that my addicted friend had become very abusive lately."	t5_2rfjf	True

A rare glimpse inside Tool's storied loft - one of a dozen or so photos recently taken by Adam, Danny, and Justin while writing and arranging their contributions to the next Tool record. (Note: When Adam sent me these photos last night, I was both amazed and a bit confused because certain areas of the rehearsal space were in the past always deemed off-limits to photography. What caused this sudden change of heart to a long-standing policy I do not know, but I am certainly excited to share with fans of the band a place of such historic significance - the small room where every Tool song [from ""Opiate"" to the present works] was written. Think about that for a minute. Every Tool song was written in the same place. I can't imagine this ever happening with any other major band in history of rock music - they having written all of the music on all of their records over the decades in the same small room. But, that's exactly what Tool has done at the loft. Receiving the photos has inspired me to dedicate the next Tool newsletter to certain ""Tales from the Loft"", which I hope to post soon... along with further rare glimpses.)"	t5_2rfjf	True

1329099816.0	pmuyd	I Will Always Bow to Music. Thanks Tool.	notwonderland	48	8	32	"This is a sad attempt at describing my first Tool concert experience. It is all I can do to make sure that I will always remember, at least in part, the greatest connection I’ve had with music in my life. 

I’ve never been a devoted Tool fan. I was introduced to Tool by some fellow college friends back in the early 2000’s and during that time, I was starting to come out of the closet as a non-Christian. Thanks to George Carlin I was able to embrace humorous logic of a life without Christian (or religious) beliefs, but it was Tool who (in part) helped me to open up to a different kind of spiritual possibility. Through their brilliant music I started understanding that we are eternal, that possibilities are infinite, that humanity and divinity are not opposite, that we are in an eternal journey of ascension which cannot be stopped. Now, throughout these years they have always been around (in my playlists) reminding me not only of some pretty powerful truths, but also rocking me hard with their awesome tunes, and on February 4th, 2012 I saw them live in Charlotte NC, and this is perhaps the first time in my life where music actually touched me. 

I was looking forward to Schism, Lateralus, and 46 &amp; 2 and Parabola [the latter sadly it was not played :( ] because those have really had a big influence on me. Although Schism, Lateralus and 46 &amp; 2 blew my mind, it was Pushit’s guitar jam that gave me a music-gasm. When the guitarist started his jam, I closed my eyes and felt completely overwhelmed by the energy emanating from the sound waves, the crowd around me and my own body. The music was going right through me, connecting me with every person in there, I felt alive, I felt part of everything around me and beyond, and all I could think of was “I exist, we are here, I am really here, we are all here, we are invited to the goddamn party” and I suddenly felt an urge to scream, not just to cheer, but to lift my voice along with the guitar, with the band, along with all my Tool-heads and send our unified sound out into space in case anyone was listening, to leave a sound mark in eternity as proof that we were there, and that our voices would leave a sound print in the space-time continuum. I could feel a tingling going through all my body and could literally see light emanating from everyone around me and I was so overwhelmed I wept the most grateful tears of my existence. I couldn’t believe I was worthy of such an experience and I felt humbled and empowered by the divinity of music. 

I’ve always been stirred intensely by great music, and have often thought that music must hold a great truth about our essence and maybe I have yet to discover many truths, but that night I concluded that great music, like Tool is able to create, really taps into the fact that we are more than flesh and blood. We are part of a great infinite reality, we are indeed the weavers of the fabric of reality and we can experience eternity at any moment, particularly with some really good fucking music. Thank you Tool.

“I embrace my desire to
feel the rhythm, to feel connected
enough to step aside and weep like a widow
to feel inspired, to fathom the power,
to witness the beauty, to bathe in the fountain,
to swing on the spiral
of our divinity and still be a human.”

------------------------------------------------------------------

**Update** - Here's the follow up! Started a new thread, but it's not showing on r/toolband.

A'right, I'm still spinning from the experience and the substantial consumption of booze that took place after the entire ordeal yesterday. After being ushered in, we grabbed the attention of Frank the guitar tech and began the Q &amp; A with him. Then Adam walked in, and with 18 other people gazing amazeballs and wondering wtf they were going to say, Adam spoke about his guitar technique, polyrhythms, and how Tool write's their music. Then played fucking Jambi for us.

When we all reformed after simultaneously exploding into a shaking mess of human goo, people started talking again. We were spurred on by the distinct impression that the person in front of us is an incredibly welcoming, open and humble human being. He wanted to know what we wanted to know. The flood gates opened, emotions ran high.
Here's some of the interesting stuff.

The Fibonacci sequence in Lateralus was not intentional. The band has no idea where the idea of 'The Holy Gift' came from. The origin of the pattern being used in the album was apparently something that Carey observed while they were belting out riffs. They thought it was a cool idea, and Maynard wanted to write lyrics to follow the mode. Bam.

Rosetta Stoned is based on a real experience. One of the band members from Green Jelly apparently ate some acid, and shat the bed of the poor soul who owned it. On retelling this story to Maynard, he found it worthy of constructing an entire story around it to fill in the blanks, and thus the song was born.

Someone asked Adam if he listened to his own music. He still goes back to listening to their old material, because, they are proud of their work. This part was really inspirational, and the message was really simple; Accept only good work. Have the discipline to scrap what you are not entirely happy with, and don't make concessions. Their methodology for writing music is already long enough. This kind of mind set complicates the process by many factors, and naturally extends the amount of time between albums. The result however, is consistency, and the result from that discipline is a reason why they're still able to work together after so long.

The first time Justin played Adam the riff to Jambi, he hated it. Further down the discipline rabbit hole, he said it was his job however to get over his own dislike of it and 'get' where Justin was coming from. It's now one of his favourites.
Someone asked if any of what Tool does 'just feels like work'. Adam said, definitely not. They're still emotionally attached with their material. He said that, 'sure, my mind might wander about my laundry sometimes while i'm playing on stage' but they still cared about their material and they still feel it.

Make any assumptions you may want on this; After talking about the above, Adam said they no longer play Wings for Marie live.

They don't work with a click track. They don't work with people who work with a click track.

Then he handed us his guitar to touch. Magic in my hands for 17 seconds.

The rumours about a movie (?) - They want to make one, but there would be three parties involved in producing / funding it outside of the band, and all three want 50% of the profits. Problems.

They're going to keep writing and working Tool until it doesn't work anymore.

Signed poster, hand shake, a genuine thank you. Group hugs. Security ushering my ass out.

If I think of anything else, i'll update. Now I'm going to crash. Apologies, I didn't end up asking him what his favourite dinosaur from Jurassic Park was.

Wings for Marie (Maynard's changing view of his mom's religion)	dtrains	36	4	20	"So I've always been a little curious as to the discrepancy between the almost vicious attack on Maynard's mother's religion in Judith (seems like a song r/atheism would love), and then his calmer, more acknowledging view in both the 10,000 days songs(but especially part 2).

I'd like to hear someone be able to articulate this a little better, but I'm thinking it goes something along the lines of:

Judith - Anger about religion, unjust punishment, and strict belief in the benevolence of a god who would ""leave you broken down and paralyzed"" (Judith, Maynard's mom was paralyzed for many years (about 10000 days) and never gave up her faith, just for context)

Wings for Marie - It almost seems like an acknowledgement of the fact that there are stupid hypocrites in religion, the ""collective Judas"", but also some people like his mom who are doing it right. 

I guess why I'm asking is because I recently converted to atheism out of anger and spite of how ignorant and stupid Christians can be, and now and kind of coming to terms with the fact that that doesn't necessarily determine their entirety. 

I guess it's also kind of an open ended religion question in that sense too, but just wondering what thoughts others might have on this. "	t5_2rfjf	True

1322603865.0	mtunj	Lateralus - the meaning		39	5	40	"So here we are, over a decade after Lateralus came out.  Without exaggeration, I've probably averaged a full listen through of this album once every two weeks for 10 years.  A lot more when it came out, a lot less later, etc..

Every few years I revisit it very intensely.  Of course I'm familiar with the 'Holy Order', the presence of the Fibonacci sequence, Danny Carey's obsession with sacred geometry, the art of Alex Grey, etc..

But I still don't FUCKING GET IT.  ONE DECADE, MAN.

Play me five seconds of any Tool song and I can tell you what that song is and what it is most likely about.  Each of their 'real' albums, it seems, has at least some greater theme.

Opiate- well the songs on Opiate really aren't difficult to understand.  Pretty blatant.

Undertow- you have to dig a little deeper to find the really fucked up mentality of this record.  Rape, power struggles, anal sex... it's all there.

Aenema- once again, a record I struggle very little with in terms of meaning and context.  Pushit and Third Eye are still a little troubling to me.

Then we get to Lateralus.  It's such a mess to me.  You have songs like The Patient (about Judith), then Ticks and Leeches (which they've explicitly stated is about their old record company), then all of this really, REALLY out there stuff.  Schism can be about so many situations.  Parabol/Parabola... Lateralus... especially D/R/T.  Like... what am I missing that I can't put this record together?  I'm not an idiot, I'm a pretty intense music fan.

But I just.  Don't.  Get it.

Anyone have any input on this to maybe open up my eyes?  I got sick of going to songmeanings and having a bunch of really stupid people debate and bicker over it.

TL;DR: what is Lateralus REALLY about.  Also, what are the songs Parabol/Parabola, Lateralus and D/R/T REALLY about.

Thanks

I didn't have any idea who it could be and they snuck up on me so I answered it and all of a sudden I'm smackdab in the middle of a conversation with these two elders of the church. They asked me if there was anything I would like to pray about. I said yes, the new Tool album, and specifically; its formation, its intent, and for the people that are bringing it together. They had a little concern in their eyes but they went along with it. (it helped them have something else to talk about in their already awkwardly started conversation.) We talked about music and what we like about it, etc etc. But we prayed about it! Anyway, the Mormon God has heard our prayer. We should expect good things from the next Tool album.

My friend, on the other hand, equates the song to a piece of shit. He thinks the riffs are ""lame and uncreative"", that the song is too long and that it's ""just Tool trying too hard to be Tool"". What do you all think?

http://thenumberoftheblog.com/2010/07/03/confessions-of-an-ex-tool-fan/

Summed up, the blogger explains how he eventually became disillusioned by Tool. He claims that their only motivation at this point is to make as much money as they can, and fans that consider the content or musicality of their work 'divinely inspired' or 'deep' are being shammed.

Make no mistake, As a self labeled hardcore Tool fan, I'm the first to recognize that Tool attracts their fair share of knuckleheads (As does any music act that incorporates 'angst', for lack of a better term).

But the level of ire and discontent about the 'mysticism' of Tool's music  has always been something that astounds me. Why does having a keen interest in the esoteric make a band pretentious? 

You can call me a fanboy for saying it, but in the realm of popular, 'heavy' music, I think you would be hard pressed to find a more sincere, untainted act than TOOL. They do it their own way, and they sell platinum amounts of records doing so. 

Has the bands success undermined their message? Do 'fucktard' Tool fans undermine the band's attempt to pry open the listener's third eye toward what some would consider 'new-age bullshit'? Does this really make them pretentious?

EDIT: Thanks for a good conversation folks! Some great insight =)

Many confused unhappy versions later I was sure of one thing, I agreed with those who said Disposition, Reflection, and Triad shouldn't be broken up, as well as Parabol and Parabola.

The entire song up until the last line ""Relax. Turn around and take my hand"" are of the voice of Change. 

I came to this conclusion by following the body parts listed in the progression of the lyrics ending in ""deep within the borderline."" They are ""finger deep,"" ""knuckle deep,"" ""elbow deep,"" ""shoulder deep"" respectively. One would think then that the final body part to transition would be either the head or body right? Nope. Instead we are told to ""Relax. Turn around and take my hand.""


I believe that this ~~undeniable evidence~~ *suggests* that the voice promising to get rid of boredom, increase love, bypass numbness to reignite stimulation, and to make the subject feel alive again gets cock blocked by Fear. IMHO the last lyric is unique in it's appeal to reverse away from the borderline, its excitement and return to the familiar path.

SERV-PRO MOTTO: ""LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED"" 

This morning the team at Serv-Pro (fire damage restoration) were called to the loft, and now at 8:57 am (PST), it's like it never happened. Best of all, members of the expert clean up team were able to retrieve the musical sections from the damaged hard drive. Amazingly, they didn't accomplish this by fixing the charred machine... NO, instead, two of the Serv-Pro crew asked Adam and Justin to play the music leading up to the 'lost' section. After the band members did so, the Serv-Pro guys asked if they could borrow their guitars for a minute. Seconds later - still wearing their hard hats - the Serv-Pro experts played the exact same a bridge and middle sections that the band members had recorded (and thought might be lost forever). This was then recorded on another hard drive (and backed up elsewhere!) Truly amazing! And true to their motto:""Like it never happened."""	t5_2rfjf	True

I know there has been a lot of pro and contra about it but buyers remorse is not why I am going to rant.

I am ranting because they ship a 150 bucks limited collectors piece of artwork (that's what it was sold and clearly priced as) in a very shitty manila-colored envelope with barely any padding and what do you know, the soft carton material looks all banged and fucked up, on a few dings the black color is coming off so I got white spots all over and overall the fibers are sticking out almost like on a piece of cloth - it just looks exactly like it has been banged up and fucked through international shipping which is exactly **why it should have been properly wrapped and padded to make sure exactly this does NOT happen.**


Oh and is there anything supposed to be on that USB flash drive card? Because mine is 4 gigs of empty space. And the plastic sleeve it came in nicely says ""made in china"", I guess as an additional joke... precious handmade USA artwork and cheapo made-in-china electronics.



And it sure is great the band is touring North America and Australia and Japan a couple of times each year but how about showing some love for good ol' Europe? It's been a good 5 or 6 years since they last played in e.g. Germany.

Maynard talked about change for so long but he seems to be in a place where he's happier now; his mom is gone and he addressed that in 10,000 days. 

I'm thinking the next album might be about the future. I really saw 10,000 Days as a kind of retrospective on his life. Now though, his son is older, he's almost 50, The last album being sort of retrospective he might be thinking about whats next. 

Alternatively, this is the last album that they *have* to do, so it could possibly be more about legacy, though they seem to be rather unconcerned with that thus far.

Through high school I was the quiet  kid with always wearing a Tool (or Rush) t-shirt.  I've tried to tell people what Tool is about and get them into the band countless times with a couple successes here and there.  I've been a loyal Tool fan for years and years.  But I'm just about tired of waiting.  I remember hearing things about the new album's ""progress"" at least two years ago.  If Tool is going to take a decade to make a record, I would appreciate it if they just came out and said, ""Don't expect a new record anytime soon, it's going to be years.""  I'm all for a band doing what they want and playing what they want to play, but when you have made music that has been a significant part of a loyal fan bases lives, you should try and think about them.  We are the ones that made all the members the rich people they are today.  They do not have to make music for us, but if they are going to they should let us know it's going to take a long, long time.  I'm so tired of hearing the little remarks from the band members or the newsletters that I've gotten to where I almost don't even want to listen anymore.  But I know the music is good, really good.  And I love listening to it.  I just don't want an album from a band I love dangled in front of my face when it is nowhere near finished.  I know this is a rant, but I cannot be the only person who has felt this way towards the group."	t5_2rfjf	True

I was floored, and now I'm still in shock over how incredible it was. It really affected me, more than any concert or show I've ever seen. The skill level of the musicians was almost tangible, you could tell these guys were musicians their whole lives and just fucking perfected this shit, you could just look at these guys and see their raw talent.

After the show, the guys were nice enough to come back to the merch table to say hi, talk to fans, and sign autographs.  No way was I going to pass up that opportunity, so I waited patiently in line.  I got to meet Danny Carey, he was very nice and humble, I could tell he genuinely appreciated the sentiment of my compliment and praise. He gladly signed my copy if Incitare on vinyl, and also complimented me on my Meshuggah t-shirt I was wearing.

Volto is currently on tour now, if you have the opportunity **please** do yourself a favor and go see them. I promise you will not regret it and take away one of the most powerful musical performance of your life.

This has made me look into a lot of their older work and videos.  One thing that stands out is Maynards visceral vocal tones from years ago compared to his more melodic tones of today. 

Maynard seems like he was very good at doing both singing and screaming in the years past but now in the most recent videos the screams just aren't really there.  

This is not a blast against Maynard I personally love his vocal style this is just a question to you guys who have followed the band and have seen them live

1348286371.0	10a8qg	"""Holy Gift"" Theory I have been cooking up for a while, please bare with me."	Laetteralus	34	11	13	"I have the ""Holy Gift"" almost perfected the concept is to have a continuous spiral into and out of the album. Subjectively yes you would think of using the Fibonacci sequence corresponding with the song numbers on the album, which in reality doesn't work at all, and ends up sounding terrible. As one can figure out the album is about trials we deal with throughout our lives we enter kicking and screaming yet leave weak. 

Obviously you will want to cut off any beginning and end silence to each song. (unwarranted step-- you already know this) Start off your playlist with Parabola, a spiraling in feeling, the entering of this world. Then follow with Disposition, the things we learn throughout our childhood becomes a juxtaposed illusion from elders and parents, conveying around the metaphorical bush. Place Reflection next because this song flows perfectly after the former... That’s all I will expand on this meaning for now, it cannot be explained in full what Tool meant so lightly. Nor do I think I could.

It is clear that this album is meant as a strong religious message (pseudo or not) through James' lyrics trying to open our minds to the expansive universe, and the earth isn't eternal but we are... We are passively living in these vessels, and all the powers of this world are creating an illusion for us to become immersed in.

I believe this album isn't supposed to be the only album included into this ""Holy Gift"" so which is why this playlist isn't perfected fully. /the new album being released sometime in 2012 probably around December 21st knowing how Tool is, totally satirical in their own righteous way. 

Play your playlist on continuous loop. Fun fact: Parabola goes into Parabol in a loop pattern. Spiral out; keep going (into other albums). The end song to each album is meant to lead into the next album (meaning wise), as a precursor think about it... Vinginti Tres very religious and deals with end of days, one of Nostradamus' warnings,  

* una Infinitas  
Abominatio Nascitur Autumno  
hic est tuum temptamen quod temptat tua potentia  
viginti tres gradus ad summam potestatem  
 
translated :  
 
* one infinity  
the horror begins in autumn  
this is your trial, which tries your (power, might, ability; efficacy, potency)  
Twenty three steps to total power.  
 
As you can tell viginity tres means 23 in Latin, the 23 steps to total power: as we know from the song forty-six &amp; 2 that the title is about chromosomes. each parent gives 23 total chromosomes 22 normal chromosomes and 1 sex chromosome. each. Its pretty much saying the apocalypse will come and God will be the one on trial by his creation. 23 steps to total power, us.  
 

The new album will be about the end of days...  
 
* I think we may be onto something!

* They're taking a long time writing the record.  They won't be putting out something they are not satisfied with.
* Justin feels he's matured as a person, and thinks this will be reflected in the new album.
* He talks briefly about M.T.void and how they couldn't get a record deal as it's a bit whacky.
* They might play some riffs of new songs on the coming tour, but don't expect a new song to be aired.  They will draw from old and newer material during a ""sensory overload"" spanning several hours.
* Justin didn't recognise Maynard when he first wore the black dress during the Aenima tour.

Though having never been released to the general public, about 30 copies were surreptitiously placed in various record stores in European cities (most of them in Poland) by members of the band and their crew during a tour over there. TRUE OR FALSE?
2) Coincidently, the first winner of the golden ticket “Seal of Xatanitos” contained in the 21st anniversary edition of “OPIATE” was a woman named “Goldie.” TRUE OR FALSE?
3) Danny used the alias of “Barry McCockener” when registering at hotels during tours, while Justin opted for, “Will McFinngerdo.” TRUE OR FALSE?
4) One of the songs planned for the band’s next album (when ever that might be) is a sequel to a song on a previous Tool album. (Hint, this song involves the concept of a transhuman.) TRUE OR FALSE?
5) In the Tool song entitled “Mantra”, Maynard gently coaxed sounds out of one of his pet cats, which were recorded, and then electronically processed to create an eerie droning effect. TRUE OR FALSE?
6) A song on the next Tool record will be called “Toynbee Tyler.” The “y” in the word “Tyler” not being a typo, as the song hints at the guardian of speculative Freemasonry, and the “resurrection of the living” as opposed to the dead, which are mentioned on the original “Toynbee Tiles.” TRUE OR FALSE?
7) Regarding Danny’s other band, “VOLTO!”, the cover art for their debut album, “Incitare” (by psychedelic artist Rick Griffin) was originally intended to be used on an album cover by the band “Steppenwolf.” TRUE OR FALSE?
8) The main riff in Tool’s ultimate hidden track entitled “PROBLEM 8: THE RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS” was played repeatedly (and rather mischievously) by Adam during the sound checks attended by unsuspecting ‘meet and greet’ guests during the recent Australian and New Zealand tour. TRUE OR FALSE?
9) One of Danny’s favorite singer-songwriters is Joni Mitchell. TRUE OR FALSE?10) For the “LATERALUS” tour, two band members wanted to have an orchestra perform with them on the songs, “LATERALUS”, “DISPOSITION”, “REFLECTION”, “TRIAD”, and “PUSHIT.” TRUE OR FALSE?
11) Justin first heard a recording of Jimi Hendrix – now one of his favorite musicians – while in BMB’s hotel room at the Hard Rock Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. TRUE OR FALSE?
12) Maynard once subdued an overly enthusiastic fan on stage by placing the person in a martial arts type chokehold – all the while continuing to sing the song until members of security handled the situation. TRUE OR FALSE?
13) Adam doesn’t move around much on stage because he has an artificial hip. TRUE OR FALSE?
14) Danny is currently a member of a modern day “HellFire Club” that at times play midnight rounds of golf with flaming balls and the using of high tech night vision goggles instead of seeing with the older secret magical formula known as ‘drops of cat’s eyes.’ TRUE OR FALSE?
15) Tool both signed with their first manager and inked their first record deal (at different times) while performing at the “Coconut Teaszer” club in Los Angeles. TRUE OR FALSE?
16) Donning a mullet wig and the appropriate attire, Maynard once pretended to be a stage technician frantically trying to fix a problem with some equipment seconds before Tool took the stage. As the band began playing “Hooker With A Penis”, Maynard quickly stripped from his convincing disguise while doing the vocals. TRUE OR FALSE?
17) The Knights Templar artifact that Danny had melted down as part of his bronze Paiste/Jeff Ocheltree Custom Craft drum kit was found at Montsegur in the South of France on March 16 in 1998. TRUE OR FALSE?
18) With regards to one of Maynard’s other bands, the term “A PERFECT CIRCLE” comes from a book written by John Michell. TRUE OR FALSE?
19) On their next record, the band will include a cover called “From A Dry Camel” by prog-metal pioneers “DUST” from their eponymously titled debut album in 1971. The Tool version will retain the same heavy echo-plex vocals, powerful bass lines, wah-wah pedal guitar lead, and a (very) loud gong intro! TRUE OR FALSE?
20) Upon recently learning that “Chili John’s” in Burbank was closed for the summer, Danny had a gallon of chili overnight FED-XED from “Ben’s Chili Bowl” in Washington D.C. so that his mates could have it for lunch during the next day’s writing session. TRUE OR FALSE?
21) During one of Tool’s tours in America, after the performance had ended and the house lights were turned on – they were then turned off again, with the colorful stage lightning turned on. Moments later, after almost – but not all – of the concert goers had left the venue, Danny played “Faaip de Oiad” as a LIVE hidden track that was filmed to be released on a possible future DVD release. TRUE OR FALSE?
22) On the recent Australian tour, Tool lighting director Mark ‘Junior’ Jacobson wrote with a Sharpie the name of one of the new Tool songs (mentioned already in this test?) on some of the golden (not red) squares of confetti that was shot from canons into the audience. TRUE OR FALSE?
23) Danny chose the original release date of JULY 23 for Volto’s “INCITARE” to coincide with the helical rising of the star Sirius (also the beginning of the “Dog Days” of summer). TRUE OR FALSE?"	t5_2rfjf	True

I just came across this song like 15 minutes ago because they are playing with Nuerosis in Denver this weekend. I know I'm not crazy here. Justin is playing the banjo part, and Adam is playing the bass part. 

[Jay Munly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Munly) is a huge part of the ""Denver Sound"" which I became a fan of after seeing [David Eugene Edwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Eugene_Edwards) of Wovenhand/ 16 Horsepower open for Tool back in 2010. 

I'm thinking that one, or all, of the guys in Tool really dig the Denver Sound too. I highly recommend it. I like the description of ""Gothic Folk"".

The band, in and of itself, has shed light on many things that went on in my head, things I wasn't sure were real; things like fear, rage and ""self"". 

Tool had something that just stuck, a sound that provoked a cathartic feeling that...made sense. After some time Tool introduced me to Bill Hicks, a stand-up comedian I've come to admire not only as an entertainer but as a genuine human being. Tool started teaching me about Jung's concept of self, about the Fibonacci Sequence, about pain when in change and and about euphoria when in comfort; the experience was like being in the someone else's imagination.

The thing I wanted to say, are not these things. What I wanted to say to this community was: This band brings people together in a very peculiar and special way, what with the new album coming up and everyone drooling over it. In this wait I see a faithful fan-base. A fan-base that is about experience and depth. I am impressed by this fan-base. Never satisfied and always digging further whilst sinking deeper the Tool aficionado experience is not complete without a process of sharing and understanding of oneself and of others.

...that's all I had to say.

tl;dr: Tool connects in a subconscious level and is therefore subjective to each listener's life, Tool's fan-base is incredible to the band and what Tool represents is something I cherish to witness be explored and appreciated."	t5_2rfjf	True

What do you guys think of the softer-singing Maynard and the pop-ish sound? I can't say I dislike it, although with the scarcity of Tool albums I'd be wary about them deviating from what we know and love of them."	t5_2rfjf	True
