Personally i am super excited for the update and would like it released now. I came to terms a long time ago that Terraria was dead and for $10 or $2.50 it was well worth it. I didn't expect a 1.2 update.

Now with 1.2 close to launch Its ok to be excited but we need to Show Red more support instead of complaining that he is taking to long on this update and worried about quantity over quality. As far as i can remember there hasn't been game breaking bugs from any update. So let Red add what he wants. He is doing all this for us and himself, Why else would he ask us what we want in the game. 

You got your monies worth. So Everyone just calm down and wait. It will be here when Red releases 1.2. Downvote me i don't care, but i am not seeing enough support for Red and that makes me sad. He has done a wonderful job on making Terrraria,

Red if you read this Keep up the great work and hope 1.2 is what we all have dreamed of as i know it will blow our socks off just from spoilers.

1362080615.0	19ewmq	The big list of information regarding Terraria	Eldritchsense	299	27	38	"I've been seeing a ton of misinformation lately about what's going on with the development of Terraria (past and present), who was involved, what it has to do with Starbound, and all that good stuff. Since I've been around since pre-release it feels like common knowledge to me, but I'm consistently finding out that isn't the case. Because of this, here's a (hopefully) simple list of important bits of information:

* Terraria was developed by one person, Redigit. He hired other people for other aspects of the game (Blue for advertising, Scott Lloyd Shelly for music, and Tiy for some of the later sprite work) but all of the coding came from Redigit.

* Terraria was released earlier than planned because a leaked copy got out, so he polished up what he could and released it before a lot of what he wanted to put in got implemented. These and more came later in the form of free content patches.

* Redigit eventually halted continued development on Terraria. His main reason given was he wanted to be there for his newborn child, while also having other ideas for other games he wanted to start working on.

* Around that time, Tiy left and started on his own game, [Starbound](http://www.playstarbound.com). While sharing similarities to Terraria, Starbound takes it in a very different direction with multiple races, spaceships, planets, etc. Release date TBA.

* In September of 2012 Redigit signed a deal with 505 games for them to port Terraria over to consoles and add new content ([Source](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=399999856732587&amp;set=a.400043270061579.90569.149488785117030&amp;type=1)). Under the contract however they have no power over the PC version, and therefore any content that comes to consoles will not come to the PC version via 505 games.

* Early February of 2013 Redigit began to drop hints that he was again working on content updates for the PC version of Terraria. After some teasing he stated in a tweet that yes a PC update is coming, and over 130 items have already been added ([Source](https://twitter.com/Demilogic/status/303710486661324800)).

* Redigit has no solid estimate on when the update will hit, stating in late Feb. to expect it, ""Within 3 months"" ([Source](https://twitter.com/Demilogic/status/306534996808704000)).

* The console version is currently **confirmed** to be released March 26th 2013 for PS3, March 27th for Xbox360 ([Source](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=481644258568146&amp;set=a.400043270061579.90569.149488785117030&amp;type=1&amp;relevant_count=1)), with a price of $14.99.

So there you go! Did I miss anything? Let me know in the comments, and hopefully we can keep this post going long enough that most of the subscribers here can see this, and we can all be on the same page."	t5_2sg5b	True

I've got terrible memory, so I have chests full of my most-used potion recipes. Faster than consulting the Guide or Wiki every time.

The only issue is the Gravitation Potion, which doesn't quite fit. ...Lousy five-ingredient potion.

----

[edit] For those making your own or using this as a cheat sheet, here are the potions I don't have shown:

* Lesser Restoration Potion: Lesser Healing Potion + Lesser Mana Potion
* Restoration Potion: Healing Potion + Mana Potion
* Greater Healing Potion: Bottled Water + Pixie Dust (3) + Crystal Shard
* The Greater Mana Potion can't be made, only bought from the Wizard for 5 silver.

* Bowl of Soup: Bowl + Goldfish + Mushroom @ Cooking Pot
* Ale: Mug @ Keg

1325033670.0	nsyf1	An Evil Wizard Has Turned You Into A Fish! Is This Awesome? Y/N (The Merfolk Challenge)	nameless88	251	42	56	"Gentlemen, I discovered something absolutely awesome, and I have to share it with you.  

Fishbowl helmet, as I'm sure we're all aware, will drown your ass if you are dumb enough to wear it in your actual helmet slot instead of the vanity spot and not notice the air meter going down slowly over time. Which, normally, is bad, right? Completely stupid, even! Who in their right mind would want to drown while on dry land!?...Read on, skeptics.  

One of the end game items you can acquire is Neptune's Shell. Whenever you go into water you turn into a merperson (mermaid, merman, I'm all about gender equality here among the fishies). This gives you full immunity to drowning, the ability to swim as if you had flippers, and freedom of movement underwater as if you were walking on dry land (even hermes boots work!).  

Now, here's the kicker: **having the fishbowl on does not activate this alternate form, only being underwater does**  

What does this mean, exactly? If you have the fish bowl helmet on *and* the neptune's shell in one of your inv slots **you will breathe underwater and drown on dry land**.  

Therefore, I issue anyone interested this challenge: Create a new map. You are a fish person. As such, you must always have the fishbowl on your head, and you must always have a neptune's shell in your inventory.  

Your goal on this new map is to survive and thrive, but also never be out of water long enough to drown. If you want, you can even make this character a hardcore, but, death means losing that end game item, and most people might get kind of angry about that. But, I'm assuming if you're doing this challenge, it means you've beaten everything in hard mode and you're kind of getting bored with regular playthrough styles. I won't enforce it as a rule for this challenge, but if you want it to be extra hard, that's totally fine.  

I would say that you should start the challenge with a brand new character, though, any way, so that you have to fully begin the game again as a fish man. I will also say that it's okay to use your high level toon to reforge the neptune's shell until it gives you a decent bonus. Because, with that fishbowl on your head, you will never be able to have a full set bonus from armor (which I think is going to make this challenge ever harder).  

**TL;DR Challenge Summary:**   
You must always have the Fish Bowl on your helmet slot, and the Neptune's Shell on your accessories.  
New Map, New Character (Hardcore very much so optional)  
Reforging the Neptune's Shell with your main character is allowed, but after that, no help from your other characters.  
The only help you are allowed is from other fish people, merfolk prefer to travel in schools, afterall.  
No Breathing Reed allowed to counteract the fishbowl helmet. That's bad, and that makes you a cheaty pants.  
Water Breathing potions are allowed, I suppose. If you can actually make one, then I think you deserve that brief reprieve from your watery fate.    
NPCs are also allowed. The real challenge will be finding a way for them to survive in a place that you can, too.  

**Optional goals/challenges:**    
Your hatred of mankind is insatiable! Teach those filthy mouthbreathers a lesson and flood the world! I'a Cthulhu!!  
Make it to the ocean, and build your new Atlantis there.  
The only food Merfolk eat is Goldfish. Potions are allowed, but mushrooms alone give you an upset tummy.  
Find the wizard NPC and free him from his bindings. In his gratitude, he will break the curse on you!  



There you have it, folks! Lemme know what you think, feel free to make alterations to this challenge as you see fit, but I think this is a pretty good start.  

(edit)  

Top of the subreddit, woo! Thanks for the support, guys, I'm glad you all like the idea!  

After I made this thread, I started my first playthrough of it. I named him Fishy Joe, and he's died at least 15 times now. If anyone can actually pull this off on Hardcore, I think we should just proclaim they are the king of Terraria.

I've logged 85 hours in a game that I paid $5 on a steam sale for.  That works out to about 6 cents PER HOUR. Nothing in this world is that cheap, except maybe child labor.  

I was absolutely blown away by the hardmode update - I have never in my life seen so much content just given away for free.  I was grateful to have it... felt guilty, even.  I did not, however, feel *entitled* to this content, which seems to be the unfortunate sentiment on TerraReddit.

My point is this; the developers want to move on and create new games.  This is awesome news for all of us.  We get new stuff to play! Perhaps in 6 months their attention will return again to Terraria and we'll get another update.

If they do, and they charge $5 for it, I would buy it in a heartbeat.  Why? Because that's how DLC ***SHOULD*** work - extra content developed after the original game's release.  This is very different from what the major studios are doing, which is removing part of the finished game prior to release for sale later.

In summary, support Terraria.  Cross your fingers for extra content.  Wish Redigit luck with his new baby.  Get excited for [Starbound](http://playstarbound.com/).

I and the other moderators have been letting some of it through, albeit with some second thoughts. Until now, there were absolutely no rules for what could be allowed in the subreddit, and all sorts of unwanted and unneeded things were being submitted and upvoted before we moderators could pass judgment on it. (looking at you, giant pixelated dick and middle finger that was recently on the front page).

As of now, the rules:

1. Images or videos that focus on immature content (penises) are not allowed, However, humour that includes but does not centre on immature content is allowed.

2. If you think it's spam, report it and it will be removed immediately.

These rules may be changed or added onto based on the thoughts of the subreddit.

Things *you* can do to help this subreddit are to report any posts that you think go against these rules or that you feel are inappropriate for this subreddit, and to upvote this post so that it hits the top, gaining more visibility (remember, self posts like this give no karma)."	t5_2sg5b	True

I read every post made to Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, and the official forums. It is nice to find a forum that discusses facts, does their research, and doesn't threaten to burn down our offices/wish us all cancer/tell us to put inanimate objects in places they should never go...

1322909243.0	mymo5	Terraria and Linux, an overview and appeal [Long Post]		208	55	85	"I've bought Terraria recently. As a Linux user not having (and not willing to have) a Windows OS installation, I do all my work, entertainment and gaming through my Arch Linux system. 

**How?**

On Linux systems, the most common way to run Windows programs is through [Wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_(software), an Open Source compatibility layer for *NIX systems. Wine can run a big percentage of Windows software and right now runs smoothly such games as WoW, TF2, Guild Wars, CS:S, Civilization V, Starcraft II, Skyrim and many others. Yes, you read it correctly: Wine can currently run Skyrim, a brand-new game, and perform decently. 

To determine if a Windows application can run on Windows or not, most Linux users refer to the [WineHQ AppDB](http://appdb.winehq.org), which is a wiki-style, community oriented database of test results, bug reports and solutions to common problems. 

Terraria has currently a [Gold](http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&amp;iId=23556) rating on the AppDB. This means not that the game can run easily on Linux, it just means that if it does, it runs smoothly. Currently, even a correct installation of Terraria on Linux doesn't support Multiplayer. And the game is extremely unlikely to install on many systems. But before we get to that, let's go into a bit more of detail.

**Why?**

Terraria, as most videogames these days, is a proprietary game released exclusively on Windows. To make matters worse, it uses an extremely proprietary Microsoft library called XNA, which sits on top of another proprietary technology called .NET. This makes installing and running the game much more difficult on a non-Windows system, since you have to install extra libraries which can give you their own troubles. 

[This](http://tom-geiger.de/?p=163) is the most popular guide concerning the installation of Terraria on a Linux system. It doesn't work on my system because the .NET 4.0 installer is broken, so much it has a ""Garbage"" rating on AppDB ([here](http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&amp;iId=17886)). It doesn't work on many people's systems, too.

**Alternatives**

While .NET may be a proprietary technology, there is an Open Source implementation of it running on Windows and non-Windows systems called [Mono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_(software). Mono 2.8 has already implemented the parts of the .NET Framework version 4.0 that Terraria needs to run. So this leaves us with a single dependency, XNA. XNA doesn't like Mono and only works with .NET 4.0, so what's the solution? 

[MonoGame](https://monogame.codeplex.com), the Mono implementation of XNA. Mono is better than XNA for many reasons, it's portable and it allows you to run games on your CPU (XNA requires a GPU). The only thing XNA offers is support from MS and a lot of updates.

And now for the prestige: Terraria could perfectly run on Mono and MonoGame, without any of the MS dependencies. How do I know that? Look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLP7Fh5baq4). It's Terraria running on Linux *natively*, without Wine. How? .NET executables can be run by the Mono machine natively. 

What you saw in the video is not possible to do for a ""normal"" user because the author of the video had to reverse engineer some of the stuff and hack a lot to get it running like this. But the proof of concept still stands and the video goes back to August 2011. That's a lot of time and Terraria developers have shown no support for allowing their game to run natively (or even properly through Wine) on Linux systems and continue to rely on the proprietary XNA and .NET Framework systems which can't even be ""emulated"" by Wine in many cases. 

So with this post I want to make an appeal to Terraria users to ask the developers for full Mono+MonoGame support in Terraria and the Terraria developers to think a bit about Linux users. I thought independent developers cared more about users, why should they keep enforcing a monopoly that needlessly cuts off a big portion of paying users? Look at the sales of the Humble Indie Bundle, Linux gamers exists and they are the most willing to spend their money on games. We don't use Linux because it's free and we're cheap asses, most people pirate Windows for ""free"" anyway.

I'm not asking the devs to rewrite Terraria from scratch using open technologies like SDL (although it'd be great), I'm just asking them to slightly tweak their codebase to allow Linux gamers to enjoy their game. If a user could do it through a bit of hacking without any access to the source code, why couldn't the developers? 

Please, Windows (and Mac) users, help us Linux users with our appeal. We're currently treated as B-class gamers by most companies and very few make Linux ports of their games. We like videogames and pay for them like everybody else, why shouldn't we be able to play them if it requires little effort for the developers to do so? Thanks for your time."	t5_2sg5b	True

ZeroAccess	176	36	70	"So this is embarrassing, since I'm sure it's very basic to most of you, but on the off chance this helps one other person avoid the ridiculousness I have gone through I think it's worth it to share...

I have been playing for a while with multiple run-throughs and several worlds, and I just learned TODAY that you can **hold shift to switch to the relevant tool.**  My mind was blown.  For months and months I have been switching back and forth by hitting the number.  I'd hit 5, place a block, hit 1, kill a firebat, hit 5, place another block etc...

If you're on your sword, for example, and you hold shift, it will switch to the torch to place it without having to switch tools (or a glowstick if you're in water).  Then if you're trying to dig something and hit shift it will switch to your drill or pickaxe, but if you let go of shift you'll still be on your sword.

As I said, I'm sure 99% of you know this, and it's probably absurd that I didn't figure it out, even accidentally, I hope this helps at least 1 other dumbass like myself.

EDIT2: Links dead. Rewrote the list.


**NPC’s**

* There are thirty-six new monsters!
* The underworld has a new master, the Wall of Flesh.  Defeating him will unlock new challenges for your world.
* There are three harder versions of the older bosses.
* There are now three new friendly NPC’s that can be rescued after specific conditions are met.
* The Dryad will now tell you the percentage of Corruption vs. Hallow in the world.
* Made several small changes to allow for better underground cities.
* New NPCs will spawn in their homes underground, instead of on the surface.
* Worms will no longer spawn when near a friendly NPC.
* Underground towns will now reduce, and eventually stop, enemy spawning.


**Items**

* Added thirty-nine statues that are scattered around the world.  Some of them do special things when activated with mechanics!
* Star Cannon : Shoots faster.
* Sandgun : Sand shot from it does more damage, and it shoots faster.
* Blowpipe : Now listed as ranged.
* Goblins no longer drop rocket boots during an invasion.  Instead they are sold by a new NPC that can be rescued underground after the player has defeated the Goblin Army.
* Boomerang type weapons are listed as melee.
* Added four new armor sets.  Each set has different helms that give bonuses to melee, ranged, or magic, respectively.
* There are twenty-one new accessories.
* Weapons and accessories can now have random conditions that modify their stats.  These conditions can be changed for a price by visiting a new NPC.
* The crafting requirements for Molten and Jungle gear have been reduced.
* Some accessories can now be combined at a Tinkerer’s Workshop.
* Colored Torches can now be crafted out of Gems and Torches.
* Added Mannequins that are crafted out of wood.  Place armor on them for decoration/storage.
* Added the Wrench to place wires.
* Added Wire Cutters to remove wires.
* Added Pressure Plates, Switches, and Timers to activate devices.
* Added Music Boxes that record and play in-game music.
* Added Pumps to transport liquids.
* Added loads of other new items and weapons waiting to be found!
* Putting the Guide Voodoo Doll in lava is now a bad idea...or is it?


**Lighting / Display**

* Made several lighting and display optimizations to increase game performance.
* Added automatic graphic quality adjustment based on the game’s frame rate.  This setting can be toggled in the Options Menu.
* Multiplayer
* Fixed a problem with item syncing for newly connected players.
* Fixed a bug that caused graphical issues for player’s using automatic weapons.
* Added a limit to how often the server can broadcast NPC update packets.  This prevents NPC’s from trying to update every cycle which would cause massive amounts of lag.
* Reduced the amount of data needed to transmit tiles down to 25%.
* The server now only broadcasts tile data to the players who need it.
* The server now withholds some NPC, player, and projectile packets based on player distance from them.

**World**

* Above ground tunnels may now be created during world gen.
* Smashing Demon Altars with a special item will cause new ore to appear around the world.
* Defeating the hell boss will now increase the difficulty of the world.  Harder monsters will spawn, and the Corruption’s rate of spread will be greatly increased.
* Defeating the hell boss will allow the Corruption to spread underground, over sand, stone, and Sunflowers, and through Jungles, destroying them if you let it!
* There is a new biome, The Hallow, that will be created when the hell boss is defeated.
* Removed obsolete lighting code, reducing both RAM usage and world save file sizes.
* Added several small features to world gen.
* Tweaked the way and amount of Underground Mushroom biome spawn.
* Demon Torches now appear in shelters generated in the underworld.
* Underground cabins may randomly spawn around chests.
* Different styles of wall can now be placed next to one another without showing the background between them, allowing for more creative building.
* When nearing the top of the world, the player will now leave the atmosphere and be less affected by gravity.
* There are now three types of traps that are generated underground.  Watch your step!
* Cacti no longer damage players.
* Game Interface
* Items being held by the mouse will now be used by left clicking.  This allows the player to place objects without putting them on the hotbar.  Right clicking will now drop the item.
* Placing objects on grass will now destroy the grass.
* The crafting menu now scales to fit the size of the screen.
* When the inventory is open, the number of the selected item in the hotbar will appear in green.
* There is a new NPC housing interface that can be used to assign living areas to NPC’s.  This interface will also tell you if a room is missing any requirements.


**Misc**

* There is a new music track for The Hallow biome.
* Underground Corruption has its own music track.
* Underground Hallow has its own music track.
* There are two new boss music tracks.
* Greatly reduced world save file sizes.
* Decreased tile frame detection time by 15%.
* Your trash can is now emptied when you die.

* Wooden Platforms no longer attach to non-solid objects.
* Placing and removing items during the placing animation will no longer destroy the item when it is collected.
* Fixed a bug that would cause graphical abnormalities when the lighting changes dramatically.
* The FPS display (F10) shows the correct number.
* Fixed a bug that swapped the lighting of players pants and head armor.
* Fixed a problem that would cause water to settle in strange positions.

I'm sorry I stopped updating [my project](http://www.reddit.com/r/Terraria/comments/1aimvr/because_i_hate_everything_a_campaign_to_corrupt/) if any of you have been following. Something happened and... well, I just couldn't continue.

So the original goal was to corrupt the entire world. Once I had started corruption in various places in the world, I set out to get rid of the hallow, since corruption can't spread into hallow. I think I spent two or three days doing that.

Well, after the last update, I was working on remaining hallows. There was some left at the bottom of the world and within the dirt layer. It was pretty methodical at that point. No big problems there.

Once I was certain that I had removed all natural hallow, I decided to go for absolute 0% hallow and started changing the tower's material to neutral ones -- cobalt bricks mostly, since I had 500+ of cobalt ore at that point. Once I replaced the tower, I grabbed some vile powder and neutralized the blocks of pearlstone I embedded in the dirt and hallow grass growing above it, as well as the garden I made above the towers. I was pretty thorough and made sure that not a single block of hallow remained in the world.

And apparently the game unloaded itself. It went through the saving process, like you would see when you save and exit. I was taken to the main menu. It was pretty abrupt, so it took me by surprise. I've never seen Terraria do that before, even after ~300 hours of playing it.

I initially figured it was a glitch. So I load the world again with my main chara.

There was nothing in it.

I just spawned mid-air and started falling. There were no blocks. Not even BGM. There was background, but beyond that... nothing. I just... fell. My inventory was empty, too. Once I got past the outside layer, I saw the underground layer background advance from below. There was no background illumination anymore... so everything was just... dark.

I don't know how long I fell, exactly. I couldn't see anything in complete darkness, so there was nothing to compare to. It was just darkness, silence and emptiness. I expected to get hit by a bat on the way down, but that didn't happen either, so maybe there weren't even creatures in the world anymore.

Then I reached hell. I don't know when I crossed the boundary. I could only tell that I was at the bottom of the world because it was illuminated from below the screen. When I landed, I didn't take any damage from the fall or touching the bottom of the screen. I just fell there.

I was... freaked out a little. But I eventually decided to explore, since there's no point in just standing there. I started walking to the right. To my surprise... there was a Merchant standing in the middle of nothing. But I couldn't interact with him -- he just stood there and looked at me, as he would in normal game. I tried to talk to him, but no dialogue or shopping screen popped up.

I continued on and saw yet another Merchant, alongside Nurse. I could not interact with them either. They just stood there and looked at me. After that there were two Guides. All the NPCs I encountered just stood in one spot, staring at me.

I started walking to the other side for some reason. Even as I was weirded out by what I was seeing, I was curious what was on the other side. I backtracked, walking by the same NPCs I saw before, all looking at my direction. I returned to where I fell and continued walking. I saw a Mechanic and another Nurse.

Then I saw Dryad.

She was walking toward me, from the right side of the screen. I started running the other way. Suddenly seeing a NPC move really, really *unnerved* me. I just didn't want to know what would happen if she reached me.

Usually you move faster than NPCs when they ambulate aimlessly, right? I thought I had outrun Dryad. I moved far enough to the left that she was not on the screen anymore. For some reason, I decided to pause and see if Dryad would show up again. Curiosity. Never saw anything like this happen in Terraria.

As expected, she showed up again. She was... faster. I resumed running away from her. She was gaining speed. Not noticeably so, but I could tell because she was following me only slightly faster than I could run after a while.

I was at the end of the world. The screen stopped scrolling and I had driven myself into the very bottom left of the world. As soon as I stopped moving, Dryad rushed at me. Her eyes were bright violet.

The moment Dryad touched me, the game unloaded again.

When I went to play the world again, it was gone. My character was fine -- he had full inventory again just as I left him, before this episode. But Metaphorland was not there anymore. I looked at the save folder and there were no world4.wld or world4.wld.bak there.

I figure Terraria deleted the world, but, man. What the fuck happened? I have no idea. I tried loading another world. Dryad had vanished. The house I made for her was empty and I couldn't see her in the NPC home menu either.

The best explanation I could come up with was that this event was a ""punishment"" for letting Corruption win or something. I think the NPCs I saw at the bottom of hell were ones that died when I was fighting bosses and wyverns at the top of the tower. It could be something else, maybe. It's... strange. I don't even know why Redigit even implemented something like this, if this even is something he intended in the first place.

I think I'm gonna put off playing Terraria for a while. It's exciting that Terraria for XBL was released a few days ago, but I... I don't know. I feel weirded out by the game now. I'm pretty sure I'll return to Terraria sooner or later (I definitely want to see how 1.2 is going to pan out) but until then? I think I'll just stop thinking about Terraria.

Still, I want to know. Has anyone else come across something like this? I think this was too elaborate to be a bug, so it *has to be* an intended feature. Still, I wonder about the percentage of Terraria players who were obsessive enough to get rid of all hallow in a world...

**Interface:**

* New lighting settings are available, including new colored lights of varying intensities: http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/lighting-update.57631/

* Players will be able to use items they've right-clicked without having to place them in toolbar slots first. 

**Core gameplay:**

* The corruption can spread rapidly and through every biome, and one of the new gameplay objectives will be to stop the corruption before it overruns your base: 
http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/evil-desert.55093/

* Holy water is a new item that will be used, presumably to cleanse corrupted areas: http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/holy-water.56686/

* A new ""Holy"" biome has been added, which can be created with an item called Hallowed Seeds. This biome is what stops the corruption from spreading.

**New items/weapons:**

* At least 8 new weapons/tools added. At least 1 new sword, possibly 2, a new spear, a flail or grappling hook, a new axe or hamaxe, and new accessories (potentially ones that combine the functions of old accessories): http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/holy-water.56686/ and also http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/more-teasers.58738/

* 2 ores have been added, Mithril and Cobalt. They appear in your world after an event occurs that unlocks ""hard mode."" A new way to mine this ore has been added: a drill.

* At least 2 new armor sets have been added for these ores, and there appear to be multiple helmets for each set. A third set, a red one, also appears, although there's no indication about what it's made from.
http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/so-much-mithril.55202/

* Colored torches can now be made with one torch and a corresponding gem: http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/disco-cavern.58110/

* Glass walls can at last be constructed: http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/more-teasers.58738/

**New enemies/allies:**

* A werewolf has been added to the game. Whether this is a new enemy, a character transformation, a new race, or just a costume is undetermined. The werewolf appears in a new biome as well. http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/hawoooooo.57225/

* A faerie has been added to the game, as seen in multiple screenshots. This is likely a spell effect resulting from the use of an item, as it has at least a 2-minute duration: http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/more-teasers.58738/page-4#post-1059317

* A unicorn has been spoiled, although not within the context of the game (thus, it could just be a test sprite or test animation.) http://i.imgur.com/nF2Fd.gif

* A white oriental dragon has been added. The details of its appearance and disposition are unknown, although most agree that it appears to be neutral: http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/something-unusual-something-strange.58267/

* New enemies, mummies, have been added. They appear in the corrupted desert.

* In the dungeon, we see a giant flying weapon has been added, similar to flying weapon enemies in other RPGs: http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/more-teasers.58738/

* A ghost-like figure with glowing eyes, potentially appearing in large groups, can be seen underground: http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/more-teasers.58738/

I just updated my world viewer to version 1.1. Amazingly the previous version had almost 50,000 downloads which is insane.

**Changes**

* Added Chest Filtering, this allows chests only containing certain items to have their symbol drawn. (Its under advanced settings tab)
* GUI elements (checkboxes/etc) are persistant between uses of the application
* Beta Worlds (i.e. Release #38) will work properly
* Symbols can be enabled or disabled on a per symbol basis
* Chest Information tab which is just a dump of the current chest information
* Meterorite is now visible as a bright magenta pink
* Application defaults to terraria world directory for input
* If the program encounters an unknown tile type, it won't crash any more
* Symbols can be customized, by going to %APPDATA%\Roaming\TerrariaWorldViewer\Resources
* Dungeon blocks/walls are now coloured their corresponding Colour
* Wood blocks are now colored like wood blocks

I don't know about the rest of you but potions are basically useless now, They don't recover enough HP to justify cooldown of 1 min, and in areas where you constantly swarmed by monsters like Underground Jungle they are completely useless you will die before your cooldown is over vs a huge mob.

If you're like me and you grew up with games in the 80s, one of the most infuriating things about modern games is the fact that they hold the player's hand way too much. If you're not being railroaded through a tutorial for minutes to hours, you've got convenient waypoints and tooltips popping up telling you exactly where to go, what to do, who to kill. It can get mind numbing.

Terraria is gloriously old school. You have one source of help: the guide. Beyond that, you're on your own. Without the internet, you'd have to discover everything by yourself... and that's a breath of fresh air. I really hope it stays that way. "	t5_2sg5b	True

1308190584.0	i0uvj	Would you guys be interested in a dedicated /r/terraria server? (similar to /r/minecrafts 'official' server)	stennett	104	6	54	"I have the potential to set up and run a dedicated server, via a hosting company which runs minecraft servers. This would be their first terraria server, and so I'm currently doing some ram usage/bandwidth testing for the next few days.

The idea I had would that it would mainly be run by you guys; I'd be transparent about any issues, costs, and other complications which may arise, and in response would put things like when to change maps, map size, max player limit, etc., down to you guys, using a polling system, or using a /r/terraria thread.

Depending on the amount of RAM/bandwidth it requires, the max. player limit will have an absolute max, in that, i'm paying for X ram, and Y players requires (X+Z)Ram. I would also be funding the hosting costs via donations (paypal) of which will not be mandatory (otherwise it isn't a donation, right?) but, without covering the hosting costs for a month, it wont be up until then.

So, my question is, are you guys interested, and if so do you have any feedback, and if not, any suggestions/comments as to why?

1314855213.0	k113b	Just got trolled by the invisibility potion	Captain_Sparky	114	18	31	"I haven't really messed around with potions much at all, because I'm nervous about using 1-time-use items that only last a set duration.  This goes for any game.  I'm always afraid I'll use them at the wrong time and then not have them when a situation actually requires them - and of course ""when a situation actually requires them"" really means ""any situation but the one I'm in right now"".  Thus, I've got chests full of stuff I should probably be using, but am afraid to use.

Anyway, I've had this invisibility potion in my inventory for ages.  I also just found the deepest part of the world and died pretty much instantly.  So I thought, hey!  *This* is the perfect time to use the invisibility potion!  Finally, I've found a situation that requires it!  So I tromp back down my winding path toward the hell world, newly confident in my abilities.  I reach the spot of my death, still swarming with enemies, and nonchalantly stroll toward some possible loot.  Muahaha!  You can't see me, suckers!  Imma steal your shit!

A bone serpent and a horde of burning bats take one look at my sorry disappearing act, then proceed to mercilessly devour my flesh.  What.  Now I'm back at my spawn house.  Did I do it wrong?  I ask the guide, but he refuses to talk about potions - or anything that isn't a crafting recipe, really - leaving me in the dark about it.  So I look in the wiki and discover that the invisibility potion is, in fact, a *vanity item*.

The goal being to acquire as fast as possible Terraria's most powerful sword: The [Night's Edge](http://terraria.wikia.com/wiki/Night%27s_Edge). Doing this requires traveling all across a Terraria world to find each of the four ingredients to craft one:

* A **Light's Bane** sword (Corruption/Bosses).
* A **Muramasa** (Dungeon).
* A **Fiery Greatsword** (The Underworld AKA Hell).
* A **Blade of Grass** (The Underground Jungle).

I did this run on a small world without memorizing the map or using 3rd party tools or cheats (including exiting to evade death).  My final time is 03:27:46 (which I've greatly condensed in the videos).  I may try a later run with a memorized map, though.

Enjoy!

1374466456.0	1isisu	I've got a story and a first time realization...	Rager133	109	21	45	"So recently I've been preparing to go fight The WoF. I was actually typing plans out in notepad. After making a platform over the Underworld, I set the list of things I was going to need.

* Molten Armor set
* Minishark
* 1500+ Silver Bullets
* Masterful Demon Scythe
* Superior Night's Edge
* 3 Ironskin potions
* 3 Swiftness potions
* 3 Regeneration potions
* 30 Health Potions
* Rocket Boots
* Obsidian Horseshoe

Well, I wasn't close to having all that finished, and was about to call it a night, but  remembered I had a ton of extra Guide Voodoo Dolls so I decided to use one as a joke fight and to get a little teaspoon taste of the hell that was soon to come.

All I had was:

* Molten Armor Set
* Night's Edge
* Masterful Demon Scythe
* Minishark
* Roughly 800 Silver Bullets
* 5 Health Potions

That's basically what I take with me everywhere.

So anyway, I head to the underworld and run to the right, drop the doll and wait a bit. Here it comes.

It wasn't as intimidating as I thought. That didn't stop me from immediately shooting at it with my minishark and running like hell. It was a simple 2 bit strategy, run and fire, use Night's Edge to kill The Hungry/Leeches. 

It was only about 3 minutes in I noticed its health at about 1300. I also noted I had only used one health potion, which was before I dropped the doll because of all the annoying bats and demons I encountered on the way.

I get it down far enough where I could melee it if I wanted to, so I did. 

The meat bits flew down, the music stopped, and that glorious text at the bottom left appeared. I picked up my rewards, still very shocked and not believing what had happened, and went back up my hellivator. (I'm this far in the game and I STILL don't have a Magic Mirror)

Lemme just say, this is the first time I've ever been in hardmode, even SEEN hardmode. It's so beautiful, as beautiful as it is hard. Everything was so different... I got to the surface and destroyed about 7 demon altars with my Pwnhammer, blessing my world with those precious ores. I finally get back home, organize my inventory, and think:

**""The game has just begun""**

Sorry if this is a pointless text post, everything was just so amazing and I had to share my experience. Thanks for reading.

**TL;DR** First-time hardmoder here, have hardly seen it, never played it. Unintentionally killed WoF. Hardmode is beautiful."	t5_2sg5b	True

As a result, I'd like to raise awareness of what Softcore/Mediumcore/Hardcore actually *mean*, in game terms, as they aren't defined in the game itself.

First, there's a strong (and perfectly understandable!) tendency to interpret these as a difficulty setting.  While it does indirectly affect difficulty, your 'core really only changes *how you die*.  It doesn't affect the game's difficulty in **any other way**.

The second half of the problem is that Mediumcore sounds like it should be ""normal"".  But what's now called ""Softcore"" is the original, intended death style and the only one which was available at release.  Mediumcore and Hardcore were patched in later, mostly to improve replayability for veterans.

Here's an overview of how each ""death style"" works:

* **Softcore** (""Normal death"") — When you die, you drop half your coins, rounded up.  This isn't quite the same as dropping half your *money* — if you die with three gold coins, you'll drop two of them; you won't make change.

* **Mediumcore** (""Punishing death"") — When you die, you drop all of your gear and respawn naked.  You can recover your gear by collecting it from where you die, unless you Save &amp; Exit, crash, or hit the item limit (about 200).

* **Hardcore** (""Permanent death"") — When you die, your character is deleted.  Game over!"	t5_2sg5b	True

1326730285.0	ojear	"""Teleportation Station"" idea, whatchu think?"	Fragite	124	40	73	"I recently had this idea for the devs to implement into Terraria-
Some sort of ~~""portals""~~ ""gateways"" could be crafted out of different gems (to create portals of different colors) and many other precious items (so these ~~portals~~ gateways are not crafted easily). When one is placed and right-clicked, a window pops up with a list of all placed ~~portals~~ gateways. The player then clicks on one of the ~~portals~~ gateways listed, and, at the expense of massive amounts of mana, the player is teleported there. Also, some kind of talisman should have to be obtained from the Dungeon in order to use the ~~portals~~ gateways.
