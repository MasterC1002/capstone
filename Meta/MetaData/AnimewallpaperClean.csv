Just figured I'd share my collection here, since it has so many Anime wallpapers, some of you might enjoy it, hopefully. If not, sorry.

Disclaimer: None of the work in these folders is mine, it's all been taken from somewhere on the internet, and if not naturally 16:9, cropped to be so. Nothing was stretched, everything should still be high quality.

I hope you enjoy :3

Some of these I cropped myself, but I'm sure many have been on imgur at some point and have been made shitty quality, but what can you do.

Minus removed their download all feature, so I posted each album to Mediafire. So you guys can just download them in bulk if that's what you want to do.

Each part consists of 200 images. That's the Minus cap, and Mediafire has a 200mb limit, so I just kept them in that format there as well.

Enjoy.

I am dreapsp/frontalspy and here I have uploaded a large chunk of anime images I have collected over the past year or so. There are over 13,000 anime wallpapers- all of which would be over 1024x768 with some even at 4000x2500. And then I have an additional 3,000+ other anime images, which are not wallpapers and are more general images, gifs and official scans. In total, there is about **16gb** worth of anime images that I have uploaded, and it isn't all I have. Most of the anime wallpapers I have gotten are from dumps and bundles, and there *will* be duplicates even though I have used a software to sort that out. 

Anyways, I have decided to be a good person and upload my images to various filesharing and image hosting sites, namely Mega, Mediafire, Minus, Imgur and Torrent. So without further-ado, here are the links:

*****
**Download Links**

* **Mediafire:** All parts are split up into ~200mb parts so there are quite a number of things to download. The parts are all separate so you don't need any software to join them up.

* **Mega:** All links are split up into 1000 images, unless each part is less than 1,000 images.

 [**Mega Link**](https://mega.co.nz/#F!ex5xQDSA!SF4irFgTP_VHsr0TIFXERw)

* **Minus:** There are two different profiles; one has all the anime wallpapers and the other have all the other anime images since I would hit the 10gb upload limit. As of now, the second profile - the other images- isn't fully uploaded yet and will be so in the next few days. The images are all separated into 300 images per album (the limit) and if you want to download all the images, use [DownloadThemAll!](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/) on Firefox.

 [**Anime Wallpapers** (13,000+)](http://frontalspy.minus.com/uploads)

 [**Other Anime Images** (3,000+)](http://frontalspy1.minus.com/uploads)      

* **Imgur:** My Imgur folder is the least up to date, with about 5,000 uploaded thus far. I have a slow upload speed to Imgur for some reason. Each album is at 125 images since Imgur has issues with large amounts of images. Imgur will be the slowest service to be updated due to the upload issues so bare with me.  
 [**Imgur Link**](http://frontalspy.imgur.com/)

* **Torrent:** If you want to download everything nice and easy, use this torrent link. I will be seeding this for the next few weeks but my upload speed is rather poor.

And that is all I have for now. If you want to know how many anime images I have in total, it is:

Also, I wanted to add that I haven't had time to really do anything with this collection, so expect weird resolutions, duplicates, and perhaps some not-so-anime-themed wallpapers. If anyone points out duplicates to me, I'll happily remove them from the albums. As a final note, I want to say that I really can't claim any credit for these wallpapers. While I collected a good chunk of them myself, quite a few of them come from other ""packs"" that users have posted here, so if you want to give anyone credit, give it to them (and the original artists, obviously).

**PLEASE NOTE**: There *are* NSFW images in these collections, so beware.

Anyway, time for the album links.

I tossed it all on imgur (TIL you can only upload 38 at a time) because I figured most sane people would just want to pick and choose a few. If people ask though I can toss the whole thing up in a tar ball up on fileshare.

1357939230.0	16efjh	Dat NSFW Wallpaper Dump ~450 Walls 1920x1080+ with DDLs	Kyonikov	50	2	10	"Continuation of [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animewallpaper/comments/16c9pc/dat_wallpaper_dump_1000_walls_1920x1080_with_ddls/). Not all of these are NSFW, I put cute/moe walls in this folder as well. That being said, some of these are straight up H, you have been warned :P

 If you're putting them in the same folder as the walls from the other dump then they should have the same naming conventions, so no worries there.

If you saw my [Megami Crops](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animewallpaper/comments/u0ub2/recent_megami_magazine_crops_2560x1440/) dump a few months back, then you might get duplicates in here. Those were posted to imgur, so trash them and take these instead.

The files here are a bit bigger than my worksafe walls so the first two parts are 175 images each, the 3rd part is the rest. Enjoy!

Edit

I've decided to switch again to Google+ to upload my wallpapers. No size limit and also lets you download the entire album in one shot.

[Link Here](https://plus.google.com/photos/117457595693893460694/albums/5866765915814790401) - To download album, click the ""More"" drop down box at the top right.

1374438042.0	1irmux	PSA: You can download entire Minus.com albums with firefox plugin DownThemAll!	Razzeus	29	5	4	"I remember when minus had the option to download the entire album someone had uploaded. For some reason or another they've removed it, or I'm blind.

With the plugin [DownThemAll!](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/?src=search) you can download entire albums quite fast. The best part is it is very simple to do.

Here's an example of the process. I'll use [koalaondrugs](http://www.reddit.com/user/koalaondrugs) recent submission found here: https://minus.com/mbeL2VJOMm7CXr. because my internet isn't good enough to upload a large enough album in a reasonable amount of time. I do not have the submitters permission to use their album. If they would like me to remove it from this post please let me know and I'll do so asap.

Once you have that page loaded simply right click the **background** of the minus.com website and select ""DownThemAll!"" from the menu.

make sure ""Links"" is selected at the top of the new window. You don't want to use ""Pictures and Media"" because the pictures on the album page are all thumbnails.

Next you can point it to the folder you want to save the images in. This is fairly straight forward and is entirely up to you. I haven't toyed with the renaming mask.

At the very bottom there is a ""Filters"" option. Expand that section to view what default filter options you can pick from. I used the ""Fast Filtering"" option instead because in there you can specify what file extensions you want to download. 

So you can either use ""Images (jpg, png, ...)"" in the ""Filters"" section or you can go to ""Fast Filtering"" and filter specific images. I entered "".png, .jpg"" into the filter text box. This way I can avoid grabbing gif images or anything else I don't want. Click start and off it goes. It's finished when you hear the jingle. Enjoy!"	t5_2ss60	True

1362372156.0	19mch1	[Meta] An idea regarding single-wallpaper posts vs. massive dumps.	manadancer	32	7	14	"I just took a look through this subreddit's history to confirm my suspicions: there have been way more wallpaper dumps (particularly large, ""here's my entire collection!"" dumps) nowadays than when I first checked this place out (almost a year ago). While there've been several ""phases"" of this in the past, this has gone on since around December, and hasn't let up. 

Personally, unless I've just finished a show and go on a wallpaper-collecting binge to stave off the post-series blues, I prefer to collect my walls a few at a time. Sorting through a few hundred to a few thousand wallpapers feels almost like work, and is no different than looking through wallbase.cc and other wallpaper sites, except Wallbase is more organized and more sortable. Looking at the vote counts on recent posts, I'm not the only one who feels this way. 

Clearly, though, there's a lot of people who appreciate the massive collections, and don't want them to go extinct. And I know there are people who put a good deal of effort (some, a lot more than others) not only into collecting their wallpapers, but also making them available for others en masse.

But looking at the sub right now, things seem pretty messy... there's just a huge disparity between the single wallpaper posts and the giant wallpaper collections right next to them with fewer points. More importantly, there are some really great walls buried in these collections that a lot of the subreddit won't actually see.

---

**Goal: make the subreddit focused more on single wallpaper posts (highlights from your collection, a really cool wall you just found/made, etc) and smaller, themed dumps (by style, show, artist, etc), while making people's entire personal collections available to those who might want it (for instance, if you like the stuff they post, or just lost your hard drive).**

**Idea: Implement subreddit user flair (much like /r/anime's MyAnimeList flair) that allows us to link to our collections on whatever image host we use (minus, imgur, dropbox, etc).**

Possible additional measures, should people/the mods think this is a good idea for this subreddit (honestly, these would probably just be formalities, and would hopefully rarely need to be enforced) --

* Limit dump size (I believe one of the general wallpaper subreddits does this, limiting dumps to 20 or 30 or so themed images.)
* Limit the number of link posts a user can make per day (/r/awwnime limits this to 4, but they're several times the size of this subreddit.)

I'd like to think that this would make the subreddit look much cleaner, make a lot of the good wallpapers more visible, encourage people to post quality over quantity, and make each dump more individualized and meaningful ^(ha... ha...).

---

I'm curious to know whether others think this is a good direction to take, or whether this subreddit is just fine as it is."	t5_2ss60	True

In the meantime, I slapped together a quick-and-dirty background and made two versions of a wallpaper out of it:

* [[dark version]](http://i5.minus.com/is3pQJSXifVY3.png) (which I kinda prefer, despite the horrid banding)

I would love that background, especially if Haruhi isn't in it. Would look great on my desktop.

Also, at 54 seconds in this video http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2012/11/26/video-evangelion-30-two-minute-trailer

Ideally, leave as much space on top as possible so anyone can crop it to their desired dimensions without having to cut anything out of the image.

Any effort appreciated! If nobody can manage it I'll just chop out the bottom bit and fill it out to more useful dimensions for anyone that wants that. Thanks in advance!"	t5_2ss60	True
