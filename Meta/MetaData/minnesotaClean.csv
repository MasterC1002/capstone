 We are writing from the Amazon Associates Program to notify you that your Associates account will be closed and your Amazon Services LLC Associates Program Operating Agreement will be terminated effective June 30, 2013. This is a direct result of the unconstitutional Minnesota state tax collection legislation passed by the state legislature and signed by Governor Dayton on May 23, 2013, with an effective date of July 1, 2013. As a result, we will no longer pay any advertising fees for customers referred to an Amazon Site after June 30 nor will we accept new applications for the Associates Program from Minnesota residents.

Please be assured that all qualifying advertising fees earned prior to July 1, 2013, will be processed and paid in full in accordance with your regular advertising fee schedule. Based on your account closure date of June 30, 2013, any final payments will be paid by August 30, 2013.

While we oppose this unconstitutional state legislation, we strongly support the federal Marketplace Fairness Act now pending before Congress. Congressional legislation is the only way to create a simplified, constitutional framework to resolve interstate sales tax issues and it would allow us to re-open our Associates program to Minnesota residents.

We thank you for being part of the Amazon Associates Program, and look forward to re-opening our program when Congress passes the Marketplace Fairness Act.

Sincerely,

The Amazon Associates Team"	t5_2qhxs	True

Day one started out a bit tricky. TIL you should never bike in a dress. It is by all accounts a bad flippin’ idea. Summit Ave. got a complete view of my underpants. I tried slowing down when I realized my indiscretion. Unfortunately, it did little to help. I was supposed to meet a buddy of mine, but instead I biked sheepishly home, hoping not to offend anyone else. Trying to retreat in a hurry, I caught a shoe lace in the chain of my bike. Panic stricken, my heartbeat pulsated rapidly as I tugged and twisted the pinched lace. I was awkwardly trying to balance standing above my bike with my shoe stuck in it. Again, I am reminded why it is a bad idea to wear a dress on a bike. A dad pushing a stroller took pity on me. “Hun, do you need help?” It almost made me cry. Like a superhero, he rotated the pedals a bit, letting the lace go free. “You better double knot those,” he said, before he vanished down the road. Thank you Double Knot Man.	t5_2qhxs	True

I'll be in the Twin Cities for a couple days but most of my time will be spent in Stearns County... But we would like to travel all around the state.  So recommendations for awesome eats, drinks, fishing spots, and stuff to do (Going to Fleet Farm to get Gummi Bears is first on the list) would be awesome.

I'm looking for the stuff you guys enjoy doing.  And I'm also looking to convince my girlfriend to move with me TO Minnesota... so help me razzle-dazzle her.   Give me the ultimate guide to MN!!"	t5_2qhxs	True

Hello, Minnesota!

I'm a Swedish boy who's one year away from graduating from gymnasium, our version of high school. However, I feel as if though I got into the wrong program and I thought that maybe I could study abroad in order to get back on track with my real passion - IT, computers, technology, what-have-you. 

Now, my father lives in Minnesota, which is why I came to this little corner of Reddit. Are there any colleges in Minnesota that could possibly accept me, a foreign student? And if so, what are the requirements? More specifically, how do I know which college is right for me? And - if you're bored to death at work - I'd greatly appreciate a quick run-down on how college actually works in America. 

Thanks!"	t5_2qhxs	True

Even with leather gloves, do NOT attempt to handle a bat. They can bite through them and it's painless so unless you see the bite mark you could be infected without knowing it.

Contrary to the belief that the treatment no longer hurts, it does. It is horribly painful/uncomfortable when they inject at the bite site, in the hips and in the thighs.

The vaccine in the arm is not painful at all so if you deal with a lot of potential carriers of rabies make sure you get the vaccine. That way you won't need the painful HRIG injections.

So be safe, be smart, don't be me.

I don't expect her to be a able to fill his shoes or anything like that but: the features she has chosen are terrible (a WEEK of religion in the workplace?), she regularly asks questions that derail the conversation, she will start by asking a very advanced question then interrupt the guest to have them explain the basics rather than starting there, the other day she literally had ~20 minutes of call in with a book you like about religion (I didn't realize MPR was CNN now), I could go on but I think my point of view is pretty clear. I want to know if others feel this way.

TL;DR: Kerri Miller is a hack

Edit: Thanks to everyone for the input, I wasn't sure how much response I'd get. Just to clear it up a bit: I don't just think she is bad as compared to Gary, it would be unfair to compare anyone to him, I just think she could be better.

NeedHelpMN	37	12	142	"I really think this can be misread as ""wow your state sucks."" That statement could not be further from the truth. I hold this state in such high regard. It is one of the most educated and developed places in the country, with a world-renowned art scene. Honestly, I've only been here for a couple months and I think Minnesota is a serenely beautiful state with some of the coolest people I've ever met. I would live here for the rest of my life if I could. Unfortunately, there is a minority of people in Minnesota who seem to be prejudiced against me. I am not from around here and have no idea what's going on, so I'm legitimately curious as to what this is and how I can continue to live here without harassment. Lately I've been thinking that I may need to just move somewhere else, but I don't want to give up on Minnesota, so I have come to r/Minnesota for help.

So here is the thing: I am a student in the Twin Cities, currently a freshman. I do not have any family nor friends (well I do now but you know what I mean) up here, just visited and fell in love with the area. However, I'm originally from a suburb of Houston, TX, and it seems that there are some people I meet who decide that that fact instantly makes us enemies.

I really don't understand what's going on. I know that current opinion of the state of Texas is at an all time low, but I pretty obviously don't have any of these negative stereotypical characteristics. I'm not any sort of bigot, nor do I have a religion; I'm also staunchly liberal. I have no accent (I grew up in a suburb that's like, all non-Texan transplants and my parents are both from Massachusetts) nor do I have any ""Texas pride."" I've been mistaken for a native Minnesotan on several occasions. I feel like I should be fitting in well, and I have made a lot of friends here, but there are some people who seem to hate me **just** because I am **from** Texas.

When some people here first ask me where I'm from, I tell them ""a suburb of Houston."" This statement somehow makes them think that I am some sort of enemy. The negative responses I get range from ""oh, what's it like being the fattest city in the country?"" and ""oh well I would *never* live there"" to more pointed statements and questions like ""how many racists lived in your neighborhood?"" I've even received incredibly offensive lynching and slavery **insults** (not insults masquerading as jokes, straight-up insults).

The only people who ever give me this treatment are Minnesotans (or sometimes people from Fargo/Moorhead, which is close). I also know from friends across the country (in places like CA, NYC, Boston, etc.) that this is not common in most other big, liberal cities. Even though I really do not think these people represent the real Minnesota, it seems to be almost entirely Minnesotans.

I am not looking for people to bow down to me because I am a glorious Texan. My parents are both from Massachusetts for Christ's sake, I'm not even really a true Texan. Honestly I just prefer a neutral response (e.g. ""oh okay, yeah I'm from Blaine""). I'm just sick of the negative treatment I get from some people and I don't understand why they're doing it. 

r/Minnesota, how can I avoid this? Is there a certain type of person that I should just avoid? Is there something I should say to disarm people? Or is it fruitless; will I always receive this treatment from some people around here?

EDIT: I'd like to thank all of you for the good advice and otherwise supportive comments! Before I posted this I honestly felt unwelcome here but I definitely feel like I can actually make this place my new home! Thank y'all so much!"	t5_2qhxs	True
