I think, as a demographic, hunters are generally more sensitive about conservation issues than most people removed from regular interaction with the environment.  Conservation societies such as the National Wild Turkey Federation, Pheasants Forever, Ducks Unlimited, and many others are popularly supported in the hunting industry by big brands and popular contribution alike.  These type of hunting-related conservation organizations have been very successful.  Conservation, as opposed to Preservation (which has its own utilization), is about using natural resources responsibly, and I don't think hunting is incompatible with this.  In many ways, hunting can help the overall health of a habitat as well.  The reason I bring up this up is because I often receive a lot of derision from so-called environmentalists (re: suburban latte-sipping trust funders) because I haven't received the memo that killing animals is ""wrong"", whatever that means, and if you know what means, I would like to understand the reasoning for why it is so."	t5_2rbpn	True

In this short time, I've had the opportunity to witness some amazing successes in terms of island conservation. Our endemic species of frigatebird (*Fregata aquila*) has nested on the mainland for the first time in 180 years, following the completion of a project to eradicate feral cats in 2006. The frigates, (along with almost all the other native seabirds, sooty terns, white terns, masked and brown boobies, brown and black noddies, red and yellow-billed tropicbirds and the storm petrels),  retreated to a small offshore island called Boatswain Bird Island after massive predation by the feral cats.

Ascension is also a significant nesting site for the green turtle population of the Atlantic ocean, and this year has seen some of the biggest numbers of nesting turtles for a long time, and we estimate that the population may be nearing pre-harvesting levels (the turtles were previously harvested for meat, due to their ability to survive long periods of time without food - making them excellent sources of fresh meat on ships)

We still have a long way to go, but just felt like sharing a little of our success. 

If anyone's interested, we have a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/AscensionIslandConservation?fref=ts) where we post regular updates on what's going on in terms of conservation on our tiny island!"	t5_2rbpn	True

In our village of Dúbravica (center Slovakia), the small river stopped running since a couple of days. We went up the flow because people told us might be a hole in the other village that would be taking all the water into subterranean caves (we could find some, but this shouldn't be the only reason). We believe that the fact they cut many trees around the river last spring is causing the water to evaporate faster.

On the way, we found many, many crayfishes and locals told us is a very rare situation. They say about 20 years ago was common to see them (among many other species). Is there anything we can do for save the few we've seen before they die for lack of oxygen / water or for the locals that collect them for eating? 

Or maybe... is this normal? Are we probably overreacting? (we almost had a fight with some people that came to collect them).

Can maybe someone share a link to ways to organize farms to preserve their existence and responsible consume?

Also, as you might notice, with the lack of water all the litter just came more evident. We want to organize some cleaning brigades and ask for help to the boy scouts group. But the crayfishes are first.

Anticipated thanks for all your comments and suggestions.

I'm Posting this thread because for about 2 years now I've been looking into becoming a conservation officer, and I know it is a really competitive career, but this is something that I don't plan on giving up on. I've been wanting to  know how most conservation officers were able to get into the career, and maybe give me some pointers on how I could get into it. Also I've been wanting to know how they like their job and some of their experiences as a CO. I'm on my last year in High school and now applying for collage. I'm planning on going to school for Environmental technician as a pre-rec for a Conservation and Environmental law enforcement course. I hope to get lots of advice from this and maybe even meet some of the people when I go on as a CO.	t5_2rbpn	True

1284305803.0	dcty7	I got a job! I will spend 9 months in Madagascar studying the world's rarest lemur.		15	1	13	"I've been offered a research assistant post in Madagascar, recording the behaviour of the island's (and the world's...) most endangered lemur, the Greater Bamboo Lemur, *Prolemur simus*.

It's a 9 month contract, and I'm only getting paid $1500 for the whole thing, though my flights, travel, food and accommodation are all provided.

There are thought to only be between 100 and 160 of these lemur left in the wild, with only a further 20 in captivity, and the population is declining - it is therefore listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN.

Aside from being a bit excited, I thought some readers of /r/conservation or /r/nature might like to know more about lemurs, Madagascar, or any general conservation issues I might know about. Feel free to ask any questions - I'm not an expert (only just out of university) but I have been involved with lemur research in Madagascar before.

For more info on the Greater Bamboo lemur, the ARKive page as some pictures and video:

Can life not expected to evolve some more?  Most of the species that ever have been were gone long before there was anyone to lament their absence.  Why is it something that must be stopped now?  It is something that has happened since the beginning of time but now it seems that because there are people that care and have enough free time and money to put to something, it is bad.  I was just wondering if there was a point of view aside from morality that someone could let me see to understand why global warming and animal extinction is hands down bad.  An explanation free of ""if we want to show our grandchildren tiger, bears, etc.""  This being said, I ride my bike everywhere, donate to conservation efforts, and am going to school for conservation biology in the fall to be a natural resources law enforcement officer.  I know why I do these things and will continue to for the rest of my life, and that is to protect the things I love.  But for someone that is detached from the outdoors, pulling the daily grind in a big city, who has to drive an hour just to breathe clean air, and couldn't care less about natural beauty, how can I convince that person that animal extinction and global warming is bad and that they should do something to curb it?"	t5_2rbpn	True
1366487085.0	1cramq	Restore the National Elk Refuge!	katqanna	12	0	0	"Lloyd Dorsey sent me a link for us to send a message to the Fish and Wildlife Service, concerning stopping the elk winter feeding. They are meeting May 9th, in CO, and would like public comments to be sent ahead of time to help reinforce the need to implement the court mandated phasing out of the winter feeds grounds. 

This is very important to us in Montana (though it is important to all connecting states and Wyoming). Radio collared elk from those feed grounds have been tracked to Montana, according to the FWP Region 3 elk brucellosis presentation. This not only affects the health of our elk herds concerning brucellosis, but especially CWD (Chronic Wasting Disease), which was documented (more cases go undocumented) 25 miles from the feed grounds this last fall, and other diseases as well. We cant afford to have CWD get into the feed grounds and spread it to Montana or neighboring herds. Once the CWD prions have been introduced to our environment (soil), the prions will remain active for 25 years or longer, possibly infecting and decimating our wildlife for generations. As conservationists, wildlife advocates, and hunters, we need to call attention to the responsible science that dictates the proper course of action - shutting down the feed grounds, as well as the legal court mandated action of phasing out the unnatural feeding of our wildlife, which creates high concentrations of elk - breeding grounds for disease.

ThomasKnight	11	2	9	"I have started a blog to try to get the word out about really good conservation organizations- a very few big guys get all the press and a lot of really amazing organizations are totally overshadowed.  If you're not in the field it can be hard to know which ones are good and which ones are largely ineffectual.  I've been involved in the animal side of conservation and know those organizations well, but while they usually work to save the entire habitat, plants are usually not their primary focus.  So I was interested to get your input on which organizations do the best work with endangered plants.  I'm looking for people with experience with projects that the organization has been involved with and seen their tangible results first-hand, not people who have just seen their PR materials and thought that made them look good- any kid with Photoshop can make a slick website &amp; PR campaign and the groups that look terrible on the internet are often doing astounding work.  I want to know who is actually changing the world in an amazing, positive way.  They also don't need to be large organizations or global (or even national) in scope.  My lack of familiarity with the plant conservation community is a weakness that I would like to fix for myself, and ideally publicize for the rest of the world as well.

If you have any suggestions, either post them here or send them to me if you prefer, ideally with a summary of what they do that you think makes them awesome.  And for full disclosure, I am cross-posting this to r/environment and r/botany as well, but I am not doing this to karma whore.  I don't care about karma (well, not Reddit's kind anyhow) and formed this throwaway account just for this question to prove it.  All I want is to help the plants- won't you help the plants?  I'm just looking to  promote conservation organizations that are helping to make a difference.

I am the executive dive coordinator for the University of Victoria SCUBA club. We are located on Vancouver Island on the West Coast of British Columbia Canada. The same coast that Enbridge is wanting to build their highly controversial, and unwanted Northern Gateway Pipeline.  The UVic SCUBA club has partnered with the Ocean Student Society and the Dogwood Initiative to raise money and awareness for the Dogwood Initiative's campaign ""No Tankers: Our Coast Our Decission"".  This event will take place on March 24 and 25th so donation will be accepted until then!

          http://dogwoodinitiative.org/campaigns

 A little background on myself, I am currently a Dive Master in Training and will be completing my training in the next month. I am also a marine biology student at the University of Victoria. Diving is my passion and I do not want to see oil destroy the waters I love to spend my time in. I will be contributing 6-8 hours underwater for the event. I will post a verification photo from my next dive and during the relay.

I am looking at Reddit divers, ocean lovers, and everyone in the hope of gaining support of this cause to keep our waters oil free.  The purposed route would bring mega tankers, the length of several football fields, through some of the rockiest coastal areas. Its not a matter of if there will be an spill, but when will there be a spill.

               http://pipeupagainstenbridge.ca/learn/pipeline

Jacque Cousteau stated that the diving on the coast of Vancouver Island comes second only to the Red Sea for temperate water diving. We do not want to see this end.

Donations can be made at the Dogwood Initiative's website (link below) 

https://www.gifttool.com/donations/Donate?ID=88&amp;AID=1942 

Any amount is appreciated. Please let me know if a donation is made so that we know where it comes from. Either through posting below or sending a message to me. 

Here is a link to our website (UVic SCUBA)
       http://www.uvicscuba.com/24-hour-relay.html
And a copy of a statement from the Dogwood Initiative for legitimacy.
       [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/VjtAe.png)

Let show them that Reddit can raise support! Thank you in advance everyone that donates and spreads this on to other divers, etc.

Cheers, Brad

AxelGiant	12	4	4	"We post a lot of links on this subreddit, but I rarely see any conservation conversation take place as a result. The thing is conservation all about conversation. Many of us probably know better than others the state the earth's ecosystem is in, many of us probably agree that with human population growth and expansion ending nowhere in sight that these issues will only get worse and more complicated... in may regards maybe we would just be preaching to the choir or to other preachers. But quite often I find being in the field of ecology and conservation can be rather depressing. 

When people ask me if I have hope and if so what do I put it, I almost always say ""Education"" and ""Time"".  Education because that leads to understanding, only things that are understood can be appreciated or loved, and we only really give a damn about what we understand and appreciate. Time because no matter how naive, ignorant, or uneducated a people, a country, or a culture or society is, time will pass and new minds and thoughts and opinions will arise.  

The only thing is with conservation, do we have time to educate? In my country of origin it seems as though time is flowing backwards, where science denial is rampant and infectious. If between 35-50% of Americans choose not to ""believe"" in climate-change, how can we expect them to understand and then be advocates of more complex conservation and ecological issues. 

As a researcher I can only provide the most objective, unbiased, best-compiled data on ecological and organism conservation to the public. As much as I want to conserve rhinos, tigers, wolves, bears, cycads, fisheries and everything else, that is not my decision.  Ultimately the only reason will will have these animals (or to a great extent intact systems) with us in the future, is if a majority or a large enough portion of people give a shit. In my opinion the only hope for conservation in the long run is if we as a people or even as individual countries change what we value.  That we decide or become aware through education as a society, that these are things that matter to us and are important. And although there are many many many people who do care, the vast do not or think that these issues are subsequent to economic, social, political or other anthropogenic issues. 

So my question or topic of discussion is; how do we make people care and if they choose not to, what then? Do we scale down our efforts, give up on dwindling species, and only protect that which has economic value? Or do we double our efforts, is it possible to do so? I'm open to any discussion, but I really want to know what you guys think of the future of conservation.  What is it that give you ""hope""?"	t5_2rbpn	True

I graduated from Wake Forest University last spring with a degree in biology and a minor in environmental science, and I've been trying to get into the field of conservation biology.  My search for internships/jobs has been less than fruitful (probably due to my lack of experience), so I'm starting to put more of an emphasis on potential graduate schools.  Could you recommend some programs for me to look into (location really isn't an issue)? Are there specific questions I should be asking myself to narrow down my search parameters?  Anything you have to say on the matter would be a great help.  I'd be willing to send anyone further personal information (resume, etc).	t5_2rbpn	True

We are most interested in providing to a fund that supports all manners of tiger conservation. Initial research has turned up countless references to an [article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/7760147/Tiger-conservation-is-disastrous-says-BBC-wildlife-presenter-Chris-Packham.html), which has us a bit apprehensive.

A few questions:
- Are there any tiger specific conservation efforts/organizations with a proven track record of success?

- If tiger specific conservation programs are not viable, which conservation efforts are worth a more considered look?"	t5_2rbpn	True

This means that they are at risk from diseases.

I was wondering if anyone here knows anything about cheetahs, because I just learnt today that there are some cheetahs in Iran, and I thought about the previous knowledge I have of their inbreeding. Could Iranian cheetahs, who are an even smaller population than African cheetahs, be mated with a few African cheetahs(they're the same species anyways) in order to yield offspring that are more genetically diverse, or are Iranian Cheetas just as closely related to the African variety?

My boyfriend and I are planning on travelling this year and next, hopefully starting in Japan/china then through Vietnam/Laos, possibly Cambodia and Malaysia. We would love to do some conservation work. I have had a look on various websites etc. but I am very aware that they are all set up by large companies. Obviously these things cost a lot of money and the last thing I want to do is simply help fuel some large corporation rather than do any actual good.

My Question(s): 
What are people’s experiences?
What is the best way to get involved in animal conservation work?
Any recommendations?
Any general advice?

I am looking for a career as an interpretive park ranger or other similar careers. I have been searching for opportunities for hands on experience in my field and I stumbled upon the SCA. It looks very promising and seems to be just what I was looking for. I have heard pretty much all good things about the SCA but not too many details. Before I go about filling out my internship application and applying for various positions, I wanted to ask you folks some questions about the SCA, provided you have had experience with them or have knowledge on it. 

How should I go about filling in my application? Should I be as detailed as possible? There is an essay section. What exactly are they looking for in this essay? 

How competitive is it to get a position? Are they very selective? Do I need previous experience and a ton of knowledge for most of the positions? 

How was your experience with the SCA? Did you find the position you wanted? I am fine with a less than ideal position. Did you find a less than ideal position but gathered plenty of experience? 

Is it any more difficult to find a position in particular seasons? Summer seems ideal for a long internship position but unfortunately I won't be available during summers. 

I want to immerse myself in a hands-on experience like what the SCA provides to see if this is what I really want to do or maybe there are other similar opportunities. I am willing to take time off from college to do this. Is this a bad idea? Are there other opportunities similar to SCA that I should know about first? 

I would appreciate any help from you folks. "	t5_2rbpn	True

I am graduating with a degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology in May from an American university and plan on taking a gap year to work and gain some experience. I plan on getting a Master's degree at a European University (perhaps through an Erasmus Mundus program) after that, as I am an EU citizen. Before I went to university in the United States, I grew up in Nigeria, from the age of 8 months to 18 years (this is relevant).

I’m very interested in the intersection of conservation science and society in developing countries. I’m fascinated by situations where conservation cannot be efficiently, correctly, or even morally implemented by NGOs or other organizations who come in from the “outside” in an effort to “fix” or “save” an ecosystem or community at the expense of a human population. My growing up in Nigeria has given me a unique perspective and, the more I think about it, the more I see my life taking me back to Africa in some way as a bridge between conservation science and implementation, and between conservationists and local, marginalized groups. My interest in urban ecology would be fulfilled in Africa, too, as cities continue to grow at unprecedented rates and as conservationists begin to implement schemes beyond protected areas. I firmly believe that this can be done in a non-imperialist (""pro-poor"") fashion that empowers developing countries and does not occur at any other country's ""expense.

My only problem is, how do I go about this? My ignorance exists at several levels. I began by reading textbook “Conservation Biology for All,” edited by Navjot S. Sodhi and Paul Ehrlich and now I am working my way through all the papers they reference in the sections of interest. However, any other sources are appreciated! Are there any books/articles you recommend I follow up on, any people you recommend I contact? 

In addition, is there any way I can begin to take action? So far, I have looked at opportunities with WWF and Rare, but they either offer unpaid internships or high-ranking jobs (regional managers and such). I’m excited to get started on something ASAP (i.e. gap year, if possible) and I really need more creative ideas. 

Thank you very much for taking the time to read this long post! Cheers, /r/conservation!

Spending the first few years of my life in the Rockies, I've developed a strong respect, for North American Wildlife. With this respect I have for the wildlife, and constant threat of losing it I've decided that  wildlife conservation is a career I want to pursue; especially for the (ex)endangered wolves. Sadly I don't really know where to begin. Currently I'm enrolled in a community college, that offers 3 free academic years then allows you to transfer your credits to a four year university. My major is undeclared, and I'm mostly just hashing out my gen-ed classes. Past posts recommend to go out and network, which I plan to do with my local Sierra Club chapter.

* What majors and minors would be most beneficial to receiving a job in this field?

* What colleges have good programs in said majors, that are somewhat affordable? I'm not going to put a specific price on ""affordable"", but on the topic of money...

*  [An instate College](http://joomla.wildlife.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=486&amp;Itemid=297) may be the cheapest option. Which of these colleges have a ""good name"" in forrest conservation? Or where would be the best place to research on said college.

* What are some other, and better, ways to network before I could do some internships?

* Although I would be glad to help with the forests, I specifically want to work with wolves. What would be the best way to ensure I'm working with these animals?

*  I'm also considering studying their habits,lifestyle, and other topics to be looked at, what major/minor would be beneficial to enter this career field?

I understand that species occupy important roles in their respective food chains, providing stability and balance to the ecosystem. But if a species' population is already incredibly low, and the ecosystem they used to inhabit is either still functioning, or no longer exists, then why save them?


I'm fairly cynical, but I like to think that life on Earth is adaptable enough to continue to function in the presence of humans. Life has survived mass extinctions before, surely it can survive us.

As such, I thought I'd post a few useful and highly regarded sites for those wanting to find out more

The **first** port of call for general interest and pictures is:

**[ARKive.org](http://www.arkive.org/)**

ARKive is a project that aims to collect media (photos, videos) for all species in the world, along with some descriptive information. It is aimed and anyone - i.e., not too technical, and a way of getting people interested in beautiful species. They often use university students to write the information, using peer-reviewed papers. I wrote an entry on the [Gabela bush shrike (*Laniarius amboimensis*)](http://www.arkive.org/gabela-bush-shrike/laniarius-amboimensis/) (my name is not in the credits, though - the reviewer/checker is credited rather than the author).

I would use this to find pictures and basic information about a species I'd just heard of, or was curious about.

The **second** place I'd look would probably be the:

**[IUCN Redlist](http://www.iucnredlist.org/)**

This is a very highly regarded (read: bible) for anyone involved in conservation. They provide the 'official' conservation status (i.e., Endangered, Critically endangered etc). They also amalgamate information from journals into a standard format, and provide distribution maps and population estimates. 

Their database is very big, 40k+ species last time I checked. This is peanuts in the grand scheme of things (there are perhaps 12 million species in total, with only 1.7ish million described by science), but the largest useful database in the world. 

Using their search engine, you can find very useful statistics - number of amphibian species threatened by XX, or in XX, proportion of described species that are threatened, etc.

Sites like Wikipedia are useful, but they lack the authority of these other sites. I've yet to find Wikipedia has images when ARKive does not, and the Redlist is used by Wikipedia for information, so better to go to the source, as it is more up to date, comprehensive, and in a simple, consistent format.

Any prospective students will come to be very familiar with the IUCN Redlist. I would recommend hunting down a ""Global Species Assessment"" from the IUCN - I have one from 2004, and learnt more from the executive summary than from many lectures.

**Finally**, if you want to get down the real nitty-gritty science stuff, I'd search **[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/)** for papers on the species, using the scientific name I'd found on ARKive or the IUCN page. You sometimes (actually, often...) need a subscription to the journal which is quite expensive. You'll be able to read the abstract, which gives a summary of all the useful information, though, and is often all you need. If there's a paper you're desperate to read, send me a message and I'll see if I can send it to you (though I'm not at university and so can't use their organisation subscription, my girlfriend is so I use her details ;) Don't tell anyone.)

I suppose this is a very verbose way of linking to three sites, but I thought if I gave an introduction to them they might be less daunting.

EDIT: Also, the **[EDGE program](http://www.edgeofexistence.org/index.php)** is brilliant - they highlight **E**volutionarily **D**istinct &amp; **G**lobally **E**ndangered species, with daily species and top 100 lists. Excellent for general browsing rather than looking for a specific species. Having a browse through, the number 1 mammal is the Yangtze River dolphin (*Lipotes vexillifer*) - sadly, I had a lecture from the guy behind the conservation efforts on this species, who told us in no uncertain terms that is was extinct. If it wasn't, and there were one of two hiding somewhere, they'd die soon along with the species. 

EDIT: The IUCN also does a **[Species of the Day](http://www.iucnredlist.org/species-of-the-day)** feature - click the image for a PDF profile each day."	t5_2rbpn	True

I don't know if this is appropriate or not (if it isn't feel free to remove it). My good friend is working on his Ph.D down in Brazil and is running into funding problems. He is trying to raise money to fund the rest of his thesis work by the 26th of September.

1346137783.0	yy8n6	what's the best way to reach students in the US? 	luisdarcy	4	1	1	"Hi,
I'm involved in organizing a student conservation science conference in Australia. We just had a look at the stats and Google analytics and as of now, we've had very little interest from the US. Even though travel costs may be prohibitive, or students might prefer to attend the SCCS in New York, I was wondering how I could get more efficient exposure of the conference to postgrad students in US universities.

Are there any email lists, student networks or things such as facebook groups where I could get some traction going? I'm also trying to find out if there are any big or well known conservation biology programs out there, where the students might be interested. I haven't had much success with standard approach we had in the oceania region, of emailing academics and admin staff at the biology/ecology/geography departments of the main universities.  

thanks a lot
the website is http://sccs-aus.org/ in case anyone's curious.

I saw a car hit a beautiful dog. The dog slid twenty feet off the road and go into a creek. The car drove off and didn't look back; I know they knew they hit it because the car came to a stop. The dog then walks out of the ditch limping and whining. I get a better look it has internal damage. It is bleeding through its mouth and has broken bones everywhere. I get to look the dog in the eyes and all I see is fear. Fear. FEAR. FEAR! I am now stopped in the middle of the road in the pouring rain chasing down a dying dog. The dog gets to the side of road and into the creek. I get back into my car and drive away, but out of the corner of my eye I see that it has a collar. You know what I do? I DROVE AWAY! WHY! Why didn't I stay? Why didn't I try harder. I would of done anything in the world to helped that dog.
I drove home crying and stared my cat for the past hour. I am now finally writing this down because I don't know what to think of myself. Am I as bad as the person who hit the animal, am I lower. I half-assed that entire situation. I think about how many different outcomes there could of been, but I chose to run away. I guess since everyone is an animal lover here, can I someone tell me what they would of done and I also wanted your honest opinion of me?"	t5_2rbpn	True
