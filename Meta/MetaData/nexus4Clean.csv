1369249320.0	1euo5a	Nexus 4 got stolen, but I was using an anti-theft app.....:)	Crocain	410	55	234	"Phone was stolen on the subway, and I thought it was lost forever.
But the next day I got an email via Cerberus. Someone had inserted an ""unathorized"" sim card in my phone.
I could see the guy's phone number, carrier id and sim card serial number. I also got a +-25m GPS location. ;)
Looked up the number and got got his name, googled his facebook page, work address and you name it.
I called him up:

- Hi &lt;name&gt; ! I'm so happy! You seem to have found my phone! 
- A phone wtf? I haven't found a phone??
- Please have a look around the house then, because maybe a friend of yours found it and inserted your sim card for fun! You do live on &lt;street+number&gt;, right!? I was just going to call the police, but I wouldn't want to give them your name if you just happened to have found it!

&lt;silence&gt; hrghfff...Let me have a look.....

15 min later

- hi, yes, I have it here...
- Great! let's meet at &lt;x&gt; in 20 min!

IAmAN00bie	344	57	236	"This tutorial is for those who want to unlock their Nexus 4 and be able to flash custom ROMs. This is adapted from [this excellent guide] (http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/1192xd/how_to_root_your_galaxy_nexus_with_adb_a_tutorial/) by /u/LAR0311, with the links changed and other wording differences and some heavy formatting changes.

Why this way? 

* This is a good learning experience. You will essentially be doing EVERYTHING one of those toolkits do, except manually!

-----
-----
-----  
**ASSUMPTIONS**  

* You are using, or have access to, a computer with Windows  
 


**WARNINGS**  

* **BACK UP ANY IMPORTANT CONTENTS ON YOUR PHONE, AND MOVE THEM TO YOUR COMPUTER OR OTHER STORAGE DEVICE. UNLOCKING THE BOOTLOADER *WILL* WIPE ALL YOUR PHONE'S CONTENTS. Note that the data *is* recoverable, but the process isn't that pretty.**    

If you want to backup anything, here are some options for you:  

[1] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.backup&amp;hl=en)  
[2] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=36499906#post36499906)  
[3] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rerware.android.MyBackup&amp;hl=en)  

* Installing a custom recovery or custom ROM will prevent you from receiving OTA (over the air) updates.  There is an alternative for those who ONLY wish to root but do not wish to load custom ROMs and still want to receive OTA updates. **If you wish to receive OTA updates, make sure you follow the proper set of instructions during Part 5.**  

* **THIS *MAY* ALSO VOID YOUR MANUFACTURER WARRANTY (DEPENDING ON YOUR COUNTRY'S LAWS), CONTINUE AT YOUR OWN RISK.** Note that this *does not* void any extra warranty you may purchase, such as from companies like Asurion.


-----  
-----  
-----  

**PRELIMINARY STEP 1**

**1)** Plug your device into your computer with the USB cable

* If the USB drivers are already installed your device will pop up and you're ready for the next step

**PRELIMINARY STEP 2**

**2)**Enable **USB debugging** in *Settings --&gt; Developer Options*. (If you do NOT see a ""Developer Options"" in Settings, then you must go to *Settings --&gt; About Phone*, scroll down to the bottom, and tap on the **""Build Number""** section **7 times**. A pop-up should show telling you that you are ""now a developer."" Yay!)  

* Wait for the appropriate drivers to install and you're ready to move to Part 1

**===If your computer does not automatically install the drivers, follow these instructions===**  

3)

* Download the [**LG Nexus 4 USB Driver**](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1992345)  

* Follow the instructions in the above guide.  

OR  

3a)  

* Download the drivers by installing the desktop client for [PDANet for Android] (http://junefabrics.com/android/).  
* Once the program is installed, you should select ""LG"" for the driver installation section. *Note: the program itself is unnecessary and can be uninstalled once you are finished. Only the drivers are needed.*  

Some people have had trouble getting the USB drivers to install, and if you are one of those people make sure you have tried both methods.


-----  
-----  
-----  


**PART 1: Download and install the Android SDK**

1) Download the [**Android SDK**](http://dl.google.com/android/installer_r21-windows.exe)  (STRAIGHT FROM GOOGLE)

2) Once downloaded, install like you would anything else.

3) Be sure to record the destination folder, or choose where you would like it

   * Example: Mine is in  

&gt;[**c:\android\android-sdk**](http://i.imgur.com/M5pEl.jpg)

4) Once installed, start SDK Manager (the checkbox will already be selected)

5) Once the SDK opens, check the first three (3) boxes; they are labeled ""[**Tools**,"" ""**Android SDK Tools,**"" and ""**Android SDK Platform-tools**](http://i.imgur.com/sSYns.jpg)""

6) Install these packages (they are the only ones necessary for unlocking/locking)

7) Once the packages have finished installing, you are done with the SDK.  Close it out

-----  
-----  
-----  

**PART 2: Gathering the Required Files**

1) [**Download SuperSu** (allows you to use root apps)](http://download.chainfire.eu/312/SuperSU/UPDATE-SuperSU-v1.10.zip)

2) [**Download ClockworkMod Touch Recovery**](http://download2.clockworkmod.com/recoveries/recovery-clockwork-touch-6.0.2.3-mako.img)

3) Once both of these files are downloaded, place them in the Android SDK [**Platform-Tools**](http://i.imgur.com/IrelS.jpg) folder

-----  
-----  
-----  

**PART 3: Unlocking Your Phone**

1) Turn on USB Debugging (Settings - Developer Options - USB Debugging) if it isn't already enabled

2) Connect your phone to the computer via USB

3) Open a command prompt window (click ""Start button"" and type ""cmd"" in the search bar)

4) Set the path to the platform-tools folder in the command prompt

   * For example: Mine is  

&gt;[**cd c:\android\android-sdk\platform-tools**](http://i.imgur.com/q38qN.jpg)  

4a) **ALTERNATE (EASIER) METHOD FOR OPENING THE COMMAND PROMPT**

   * Open your platform-tools folder (C:\android\android-sdk\platform-tools)

   * Inside the folder, press and hold **Shift** and **Right-click**

   * A dialog box will popup, select [""**Open command window here**""](http://i.imgur.com/06UNU.jpg)

5) Check the ADB connection status by typing  

&gt;[**adb devices**](http://i.imgur.com/dpZBo.jpg)  

into the command prompt and press enter

   * If a serial number is displayed, the connection is successful

6) Type  

&gt;**[adb reboot bootloader](http://i.imgur.com/cN7Fo.jpg)**    

into the command prompt and press enter

   * This reboots the phone into ""fastboot"" mode (Big green Android guy with the green word ""Start"" at the top

7) Type  

&gt;**[fastboot oem unlock](http://i.imgur.com/ey43n.jpg)**  

into the command prompt and press enter (If a FAILED message pops up like in the picture, just ignore it.  Everything works just fine)

   7a) You will then be prompted on your phone on whether or not to unlock the bootloader.

   7b) Click yes if you want to continue (**Volume Up/Down** to highlight and **Power** to select)

   7c) Once you’re back at the screen with the big green “Start,” press the power button to let it reboot.   

**Please note that it will take a while for your phone to reboot, it's normal.**

**DO NOT CLOSE THE COMMAND PROMPT**

-----  
-----  
-----  

**PART 4: Pushing the SuperSU File to Your Phone**

1) Turn USB Debugging back on (Settings/Developer Options/USB Debugging) after completing the initial set-up

2) In the command prompt, type  

&gt;**adb push UPDATE-SuperSU-v1.10.zip /sdcard/**  

 and press Enter

**ALTERNATIVELY:**

2a) If you do not wish to use the ADB Push method, you can simply drag the UPDATE-SuperSU-v1.10.zip into the root of your /sdcard folder like you would anything else.

-----  
-----  
-----  

**PART 5: Loading A Custom Recovery**  

**--------IF YOU WISH TO RECEIVE OTA UPDATES, DO STEP 2A INSTEAD OF STEP 2--------**

1) In the command prompt, type  

&gt;**adb reboot bootloader**  


2) Once the phone has booted to the bootloader screen, type  

&gt;**fastboot flash recovery recovery-clockwork-touch-6.0.2.3-mako.img**  

2a) **FOR THOSE WHO STILL WANT OTA UPDATES**  

Once the phone has booted to the bootloader screen, type  

&gt;**fastboot boot recovery-clockwork-touch-6.0.2.3-mako.img**  

Your phone will now boot into recovery, so you can go to step 4.  


3) Press the volume down button on your phone until the ""Recovery"" option is selected. Press the power button to reboot into recovery mode.  

4) If you were successful, your phone should have booted into Clockworkmod Touch Recovery (it will say so at the top!)  

-----  
-----  
-----  


**PART 6: Flashing the SuperSU file**

1) Tap ""**install zip from sdcard**""

2) Tap ""**choose zip from sdcard**""

3) Tap ""**UPDATE-SuperSU-v1.10.zip**""

4) Tap ""**Yes - Install UPDATE-SuperSU-v1.10.zip**""

5) Once it finishes installing, tap ""**+++++Go Back+++++**""

6) Tap ""**reboot system now**""


7) Your phone will reboot

8) Once your phone is back on, open the app drawer and select [**SuperSU**](http://i.imgur.com/J8Z6d.png)

9) Once the app opens, a dialog box *may* pop up saying ""[**The SU binary needs to be updated. Continue?**](http://i.imgur.com/CBHg0.png)"". If it does not then you are good to go!

9a) Press continue and it will say Installation Success once it's finished  

**YOU ARE NOW ROOTED, AND IF YOU WISH YOU CAN INSTALL A CUSTOM ROM**  

-----  
-----  
-----  

**---OPTIONAL---PART 7: Flashing a custom ROM, kernel, mod, etc.**  

1) Download the custom ROM, kernel, mod, etc. of your choice. [This XDA thread] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1975842) contains a nice index of things you can try out.  

2) Copy the file you want to flash to your Nexus 4's storage (a simple drag-and-drop from the computer is sufficient).

3) Reboot into recovery. You have several options to do this.  

3a) Download *any* root-enabled reboot app. [This is one such example.] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=simple.reboot.com&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsInNpbXBsZS5yZWJvb3QuY29tIl0.)  

3b) With your phone plugged in, type  

&gt;adb reboot recovery  

3c) Power off your phone holding the power button. Then, power on your phone by holding the power button AND holding the volume down button. Your phone should boot into the bootloader. Next, you can boot into the recovery mode by pressing volume down and selecting ""Recovery.""  

4) Once in the recovery, do the following sequence of steps (you will notice how repetitive it gets!):  

-----IF FLASHING A NEW ROM, PLEASE DO A FACTORY RESET THEN DO THESE STEPS-----   

4a) Tap ""**install zip from sdcard**""  

4b) Tap ""**choose zip from sdcard**""  

4c) FIND THE ZIP FILE YOU WANT TO FLASH AND TAP ON IT, ex. XXXXXXXX.zip

4d) Tap ""**Yes - Install XXXXXXXX.zip**""

4e) Once it finishes installing, tap ""**+++++Go Back+++++**""  

4f) Repeat steps 4a-4e to install the Google Apps zip, or a custom kernel or other mod if you wish.

4g) Tap ""**reboot system now**""

With that in mind, IF you are interested in rooting your device (*by all means if you are content with how the stock experience is, then there's no need to root*), hopefully this'll answer some questions.  

---**Do I want to root?**---  

Totally up to you. Rooting and/or Installing a new ROM can bring with it tons of customization features at the system level that cannot be replicated through apps such as nav bar customization and status bar customization. Installing new ROMs and/or kernels can also fix nasty bugs that otherwise won't get around to your device until the next Android update, and can give you the possibility of better battery life and other neat tweaks like color management. There are trade-offs, though. You might run into bugs particular to a certain ROM, or in the case of kernels you might sacrifice a bit of smoothness in favor of that better battery life. In my opinion, the benefits outweigh the negatives, but it's definitely not for everybody.

---**How do I root my phone?**---  


With a Nexus device, this is fairly simple.  

You have the option to use a toolkit to do it automatically, or you can do it manually yourself.  

[Automatically with the Nexus 4 Toolkit] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1995688).  

[Automatically with the Nexus General Toolkit by Wugfresh.] (http://www.wugfresh.com/nrt/)  

[Manually through adb using my guide] (http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/14kghb/how_to_unlockroot_your_nexus_4_with_adb_a/#linkt) or any other guide/how-to you can find on XDA.  

---**What can I do once I'm rooted?**---  

[Here is an index] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1975842#link) of nearly all the kernels, ROMs, mods, etc. that you can play around with. It seems daunting, I know, but there's just so much options available it's difficult to summarize each and every one.  

As for kernels, if you have no idea what the hell any of the words mean, [I tried my hand at explaining them a bit] (http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/158t1i/custom_kernels_a_guide_on_what_you_need_to_know/#link) (it's a little outdated, but I'm going to edit in all the new changes that devs have gotten around to).

Lastly, for anything else related to the Nexus 4 I would keep up to date with the [Nexus 4 sub-forum on XDA.] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=1907) Despite all the hate that XDA gets, there's really no better place to get your fix of Nexus 4-related news.

My phone is unlocked and rooted, but I'm still running the stock 4.2.2 firmware so you don't need to be running a custom ROM to get this working, though it'll work with any of the ROMs out there.  I've seen people say that you don't need to be rooted to flash the new radio and make the changes, just be unlocked, but if you're going to unlock it you might as well root it.  I used the [Nexus 4 toolkit](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1995688) to unlock and root.  WARNING:  this is going to wipe your phone!  You can use the toolkit to back it up first, but it's going to get reset.  

**4.3**  

The toolkit will not root an OTA 4.3 install, but you can use it to go from 4.2.2 to 4.3 and keep root without wiping any data.  

Download [the 4.3 factory image](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images?hl=pt-BR#occamjwr66v) and unzip the .tar file using [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/).  
Unzip image-occam-jwr66v.zip.  
Copy the system.img and boot.img files into the put_img_files_to_flash_here folder in your Nexus 4 Toolkit folder.  
Plug your phone into your computer and open up the toolkit and select option 13 for the 4.2.2 build.  
Select option 11 to flash an image to the device.  
Type system.img and then select #2 to Flash, then 5 for System.  
Type N to have the toolkit boot into fastboot mode and flash the image.  

Do it again for the boot.img file, flashing it into the Boot partition.  Now you can reboot and your phone will update to 4.3!  


**The Files and Flashing**  

**4.2.2**  

You're going to need to flash three files, change the APN settings, then go to the phone's menu to enable LTE.  The three files are the .33 radio, an audio fix for that radio, and the necessary build.prop instructions to identify your phone as an LTE phone.  (/u/Panaka explained pretty well [in this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/1i44br/now_with_the_tmobile_rollout_will_they_bring_back/cb0thjf) why it's necessary to use an older radio version.)  Download this [All-in-one .zip](https://sites.google.com/site/bpearuploads/) to your phone and remember where you put it.  (The default location is going to be in the Downloads folder.)

Many ROMs already have an older radio version and/or won't need the audio fix when rolling back the radio.  If you want to get the necessary zip files seperately then you can get the [radio](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2087227), the [audio fix](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=40411100&amp;postcount=537), and the [build.prop fix](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=39908391).    

Now either boot into recovery or use something like [ROM Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.rommanager&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDNd) or [GooManager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.s0up.goomanager&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDNd) to flash the zip file.  Whichever way you go, you'll want to select Install Rom (or file) from SDcard and select the file you downloaded.  

**4.3**  

Download [TWRP recovery](http://goo.im/devs/OpenRecovery/mako/openrecovery-twrp-2.6.0.0-mako.img) and put it in the toolkit images folder talked about in the 4.3 section above.  
Download [SuperSU 1.43](http://download.chainfire.eu/342/SuperSU/UPDATE-SuperSU-v1.43.zip) and the [Hybrid 0.33/0.84 All-in-one .zip](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2358931) and put them in the toolkit zip_file_to_sideload folder.  
Using the toolkit, flash the TWRP image into the Recovery partition on your phone.  
From the main menu in the toolkit, select #16 to sideload the SuperSU .zip file and do it using TWRP.  
Once that's done repeat it to flash the All-in-one .zip.  
Reboot the phone and unplug it from your computer.  


**APN Settings**  

**4.2.2 and 4.3**

Now you need to either change your APN or make a new one.  To get there go to Settings&gt;More...&gt;Mobile networks&gt;Access Point Names.  These are the settings you're going to want:  


Name: T-Mobile US LTE  

APN: fast.t-mobile.com  

MMSC: http://mms.msg.eng.t-mobile.com/mms/wapenc  

MCC: 310  

MNC: 260  

APN type: default,supl,mms  

APN protocol: IPv4/IPv6  

At first I couldn't get LTE to work and had to spend 20+ minutes troubleshooting it before I realized that I'd missed the ""-"" in ""fast.t-mobile.com"".  Trust me when I say that that dash is important.  And don't forget to save the changes.  


**Phone Menu**  

**4.2.2**

Now go to your dialer and dial * # * # 4636 # * # *  and a menu will pop up.  Go to Phone Information and scroll down to ""Set preferred network type"".  It's just above the ""Turn off radio"" button.  Change it to ""LTE/GSM/CDMA auto (PRL)"" or any of the LTE options.  And Voila!  Now you should have LTE data!    

(/u/not-brodie has found that, after editing the build.prop file, some ROMS will give a new option under Settings&gt;More...&gt;Mobile Network called ""Network mode"" that will allow you to select LTE without going into the phone menu.  [He talks about it here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/1h5wjr/for_those_that_use_lte_on_their_n4/).)  


**Making it stick after a reboot**

**4.2.2 and 4.3**

Depending on what files you flashed and which ROM you're on, you may need to go into the 4636 menu after a reboot to select LTE again.  To avoid having to do that, download [sqlite Database Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mixo.sqlitedbeditor) and change the preferred_network_mode value.  

Open the editor, go to the menu and select ""Applications Databases""  
Scroll down and tap on ""Settings Storage""  
Tap on ""global"" and then the ""SELECT *"" button  
Look for ""preferred_network_mode"" (it may be on the next page) and select it  
Hit the ""Edit/View"" button and change the value to 9, then hit ""UPDATE""  
Do the same thing for ""network_preference""  


**AGPS fix**  

**4.2.2**

Some are reporting that this breaks agps, which apparently causes Google Now to stop working and prevents the phone getting a gps lock.  /u/Ixa has found a fix:  

Download [GPS Status](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eclipsim.gpsstatus2&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5lY2xpcHNpbS5ncHNzdGF0dXMyIl0.)  
Choose Tools  
Choose Manage A-GPS State  
Choose Reset  
get back to that menu  
Choose Download

I don't want to give any outdated information out!**    

-----  
---**What IS a kernel?**---  

* The ELI5 answer: ""An analogy: the Kernel is like the Engine, Electrical system and the Transmission to a car. The Library, Framework and the Apps [AKA ROM] are the body frame and the rest of the Car."" - faux123  
 
In other words, the kernel is the software that controls the hardware at a very low level.  

-----  

---**The Stock Kernel**---  

The ""stock"" kernel is the kernel that comes with your Nexus 4 out of the box. It's compiled directly from Google's kernel source code and shipped on your device with zero modifications. A custom kernel, on the other hand, compiles the stock kernel source and adds various modifications to that code.  

**What are those modifications that kernel devs employ?**  

To understand what they mean, you need to understand the features of the stock kernel first!  

*What are the stock kernel parameters?*  
&gt;CPU min frequency: 384 MHz  
&gt;CPU max frequency: 1512 MHz  
&gt;Governor: Ondemand  
&gt;I/O Scheduler: CFQ  

*What does each parameter represent?*  

* CPU frequency: you can simply think of this as the ""speed"" the CPU is running at  
* Governor: regulates the CPU frequency based on many different parameters such as load and time-in-state. [Here is an excellent list] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1369817) of many of the most common CPU governors and how each works. Note that you will only see a couple of the CPU governors on this list in whatever kernel you use. Ondemand and Interactive are by far the most widely used, and are the ones you should look at.  
* I/O Scheduler: handles how the system makes disk access; Please refer to the previous linked thread and scroll down to the 4th post for a detailed list.  

**What else do you need to know?**  

--*PowerHAL*--    
&gt;PowerHAL is what makes Project Butter. The powerHAL is a ROM component that tells the kernel to BOOST the CPU frequency to higher values in response to UI inputs. The higher CPU frequencies can better respond to UI demands so the overall experience is smoother than without. - faux123  

--*mpdecision*--   

&gt;All Qualcomm based phones have Qualcomm prorprietary userspace binary called ""mpdecision"" aka m(ake)p(oor)decision. Instead of letting the kernel itself to decide what frequencies and how many cores to run, this ""mpdecsion"" binary polls the kernel run queue statistics and decides for the whole system the ""optimal"" frequency and the ""optimal"" number of cores to use. The concept is fine, except the decision making is done in userspace and it's 100% closed source so there's no way to tweak it and there's a latency (because all userspace binaries needs to ""poll"" the kernel for the latest information which is slightly delayed). - faux123  

ELI5: mpdecision is a proprietary Qualcomm daemon that makes calls to the SoC (the entire chip your phone uses) to manage the cores. The OS (PowerHAL) makes a request to mpdecision and then mpdecision makes a request to the first two cores to ramp them up. - _motley  

*Why do kernel devs mess with these?*  

In practice, the PowerHAL ramping up trick successfully got rid of a lot of the UI lag since Android 4.1. However, this comes at the cost of battery life (and heat generation!) The reason for this is because the system ramps up its CPU on every touch input, rather than waiting for the kernel to calculate the load and ramp up accordingly. On the Nexus 4, when the PowerHAL makes a call to mpdecision it locks the minimum CPU to 1026 MHz upon touch input for the first two cores. While this DOES give you the buttery-smoothness you would expect, it's a bit overly aggressive. This is part of the reason why stock kernel tends to heat up your phone when you play around with it a lot.  

-----  

---**Custom Kernels**---  

**What changes should I look out for?**  

--*mpdecision*--  

Many kernel devs don't like Qualcomm's implementation, so they work around or get rid of it. Franco, Faux, Bricked, Matr1x, Motley, and Trinity have gotten rid of it/used their own implementations. Harsh and IntersectRaven's leave it intact. Every kernel dev implements things in their own way, and the only way to tell which is better for you is to try each one. This is by far the biggest change any kernel dev can make, as it completely alters how the system handles hotplugging and CPU scaling. In general, you'll find kernels without mpdecision running cooler, with greater battery life, but with a little more lag (made up for by other tweaks).  

--*thermald*--  

A binary that controls how to throttle your CPU based on CPU and battery temperatures. You can find the config file in /system/etc/thermald.conf. Stock configs lead to aggressive thermal throttling (battery temp. at 36 degrees C for example, which is easily achieved). You can look into the file and see the various thresholds and actions that the system takes to lower the temperature of the CPU and battery, but it isn't really necessary. Just know that some kernel devs may have changed this in order to allow your phone to run at higher frequencies for an extended period of time, or to further make your phone run cooler.  

--*Underclocking*--  

Quite straightforward, by limiting the max frequency your CPU can use, you use less power (higher frequency results in more power dissipated by the CPU).  
P = C(V\^2)f where C is capacitance, V is the voltage, and f is the current frequency  
..gives you an idea of how underclocking (and undervolting) uses less power.    

--*Undervolting*--  

This is all the rage today, with many users trying to get as low as possible stable voltage. It's arguable how much undervolting saves battery life, but there's no doubt it reduces heat dissipated from the CPU (see: the above formula). Your CPU is located on the top half of your phone, which is likely where you've felt the heat before. How much your chip can successfully undervolt [depends on what type of binned CPU you have] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2052496). If you want to undervolt, I recommend checking if the voltages you set are stable by [running the StabilityTest app] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.into.stability&amp;hl=en) and doing the Scaling Stability Test. The frequencies' voltages definitely don't scale linearly, so don't assume that doing global undervolts will be the best you can do. You'll have to apply voltages one by one if you truly want the lowest your chip can possible handle.  

--*Overclocking/overvolting*--  

Bricked, Trinity, and Motley's kernel implement this, because it CAN be dangerous. Overclocking usually requires overvolting the processor (so the overclock is stable) but overvolting carries with it the risk of bricking your phone by frying the CPU. Know that doing this has some risks before you try it. Some kernels like Matr1x and Faux's also allow for the GPU to be overclocked if games run a little slowly for you.  

--*Hotplugging*--  

Hotplugging is where the individual cores on your phone switch on/off depending on the load on the CPU. The advantage of hotplugging is a reduction in power used because the cores will only turn on when needed. Kernels that use the auto_hotplug binary by Thalamus (that would be Matr1x, Motley, Trinity, Bricked at the moment) allow you to fine tune the enabling and disabling thresholds. These parameters are generally for advanced users only as they require you to write scripts to control them.  

--*Color Control*--  

Gives you the ability to change color multipliers and gamma settings to calibrate your display. If you feel your display is too yellow, or you miss the previous feel of your previous phone, then you can mess around with this to get better color reproduction. [You can find some user examples here] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoDp2qRui0u0dGE4T2gtSDBTRHVFSldPS2RrX1Rya0E#gid=0) to give you a good idea of what can be done. Gamma control currently requires either Faux's control app or for certain kernels you can use scripts to control them.  
  
--*Wakelock reduction*-- 

Some kernels have reduced the msm_hsic_host wakelock duration so your phone enters deep sleep more often. How much improvement this makes is debatable, and whether or not this wakelock is even an issue is also debatable.  

--*Kernel modules*--  

Some kernels make modifications to the low-level drivers that interact with the components of your phone. [An explanation of what is commonly touched can be found here.] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=22134559&amp;postcount=3) You don't really have to worry about this, just know that something is being improved when a kernel dev mentions it.  

-----  
---**Installing a Custom Kernel**---  

Just flash the zip in your recovery of choice. No need for wiping cache or anything. However, one thing to note that might save you some headache in the future is: what exactly are you flashing? When you flash a kernel, you are not just flashing the kernel, you are writing to the entire boot partition. The boot partition is made up of the kernel AND the ramdisk (the ramdisk is an image that the kernel mounts read-only at boot, it is basically used by the kernel to mount the rest of the system images). Some kernel devs pack their own ramdisk into their boot.img that you are flashing, so when you try to flash a DIFFERENT kernel, you end up in a bootloop. (An example: flash Franco kernel --&gt; flash Faux kernel on top = bootloop.) To solve this you need to reset the ramdisk by flashing a [stock reset kernel with the stock ramdisk] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1550949&amp;d=1355107145).

Save these two files into a folder, and load the unpacked extension in chrome.

Steps to do that:

* 1. Save the two above files to a folder somewhere on your computer.
* 2. Go here on Chrome: chrome://chrome/extensions/
* 3. Click check on Developer Mode
* 4. Click Load Unpacked Extension
* 5. Choose the folder you saved the two above files.
* 6. Open 5 to 10 tabs of the play site (with the phone you want, 8gb or 16gb).
* 7. Watch them refresh until you see the tab turn to shopping cart, from there, attempt your purchase.

Both a friend and I got the phone within 10 minutes of the script running, I suggest opening 5 to 10 tabs. Once one tab turns from Nexus to Shopping... you should be good to go.

1370529141.0	1fsikz	An overview of the (4?) Nexus 4 hardware revisions	ddfall	169	32	78	"Hi everyone!

To the best of my knowledge, there have been four hardware revisions to the Nexus 4 to date. I wanted to create this post to put some of this information in the same place as what I've discovered seems to be scattered all over the place. Plus, I'm hoping that some of you can help me tidy this up and note any changes that were not mentioned.

Here goes:

* **REV 10** - AFAIK, this is considered to be the original / initial batch of Nexus 4 phones
* **REV 11** - According to [this](http://celltraderonline.com/showthread.php?4253-Knowing-The-Difference-Nexus-4-REV-10-Vs-Nexus-4-REV-11), REV 11 not only ran a little bit faster (scored slightly higher in benchmarks), but also has a smaller camera sensor. The camera is said to be improved over the original batch, and the screen is more on the yellow side, while the original was ""whiter"". REV 11 is also 6 grams lighter than REV 10, which came in at 140 grams. *Update &amp; Edit: Based on the below comments/feedback, it would appear that some REV 11 models also have the ""Nipples"". That's news to me.*
* **REV 12** - This is the version that [added little nubs / ""nipples""](http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/03/28/did-google-and-lg-silently-and-subtly-update-the-nexus-4s-design/) to the bottom of the phone's back side in order to raise it off of flat surface, thereby improving speaker audio quality and helping to avoid it sliding around due to the glass back. Another change is a reduction in the size of the camera lens' outer ring over the previous version. *Update &amp; Edit: Apparently, this REV also [included a fix](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=36985604&amp;postcount=4) for qi-charging on the Nokia DT 900 charger.*
* **REV 13** - Appears to be nearly identical to REV 12. If you now what changed, give me a link to some info and I'll add it.

*Note: Each revision is sometimes listed slightly differently as rev_1x, Rev1x, Revision 1.x, Revision 1x, where x is the current number.*

*Note 2: Thanks to [orphanitis](http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/1fsikz/an_overview_of_the_4_nexus_4_hardware_revisions/cadhr7t), I have one report that some White Nexus 4s are REV 11.*

Want to check what model / hardware revision you have? You can do this by going into the boot loader. Do this by powering off your Nexus 4, and holding the Volume Down + Power.

Leave a comment with what version you have. If you know something I failed to mention, please comment and I will try to update this to reflect the changes.

*Edit: Thanks for the feedback so far everyone!*

*Edit 2: C'mon guys, downvotes? For what? This is a very relevant thread. If you don't care, just move along then... :-)*

*Edit 3: Hi again everyone. Thanks for all of the awesome feedback and comments. As I'm not active on XDA, I've not added this there. However, if you are, please feel free to use the above as a guide to start something. It would be great to have a single page with this info that's kept up to date.*

Received today, Friday 11/16 at 11:30am.

I came from an iPhone 4s and I gotta say, I was a little worried about the size of the phone. As soon as I unboxed it and picked it up, all of my worries were gone. This phone is a bit larger, but if you've used an iPhone with a case for any amount of time, this phone feels right at home in your hands. 

The weight of this phone actually feels a tad bit lighter than my 4s does. The thickness is about the same and the build quality of this phone is top notch. Powering it on was a dream to see. The display is so crisp and clean, and colors are much richer and deeper than my iPhone, and even my nexus 7. I'm a pixel pusher and normally I can see some pixelation even in dense screens like the iPhone 4s. Not here. It literally looks like illuminated paper with print.

Setup was super fast. I logged in using the same Google account I've got setup for my nexus 7 and it hurried away to try to start installing everything I had on my tablet. I had to rush to go stop those downloads, because I didn't want all the same stuff on the phone as I have on my tablet.

As far as battery is concerned, it came to me with about 30% battery life left. I messed around for a good hour and a half and it was down to about 14%. I've since charged it full, and I'm seeing a pretty decently slow drain out of it, using it as I normally would. Its early, but I could easily see the battery lasting me a full day with about 20% to spare by evening plugin time.

As for performance, this thing flies. Seriously, it's badass. I was actually quite blown away with how snappy and fast this phone is. I would say its at least twice if not 3-4 times as fast as my nexus 7. And as for my iPhone 4s, I had pretty much already forgotten about it.

Multitasking is really nice and quick, native apps like gmail and messaging load up on a cold start almost instantly.

I checked out the camera function and noticed that photosphere wasn't there yet. Had an update waiting for me and proceeded to install. Everything was in place after that.

Speaking of installs, installing apps from the play store goes super quick. I'd wager to say I'm getting a much faster WiFi transfer through this phone than through my nexus 7. I updated about 12 apps at once, which would have taken the N7 about a minute to do, and slow down performance of the play store whilst doing it. Not so on the Nexus 4. She started flying and I went off browsing other apps with no noticeable slow down at all. All apps were updated within 30 seconds tops.


There are a few things I'm trying to figure out that don't quite make sense with 4.2. 

The lock screen widgets are a nice touch, but they do this weird pull down shade thing, where the lock icon goes small at the bottom and when you click on it they slide back up if they were running full screen. Also, the unlock slide can go in any direction now. Was only to the right on my nexus 7.

With lock screen widgets installed, the camera is a slide to the right, as it's own widget, instead of a lock circle icon.


Also, 4.2's keyboard is astoundingly nice. The original keyboard I started using on the nexus 7 was so slow and predictive typing was so far off that I had decided to use swift instead and loved it. I figured I'd need to go install that again for this device, but after trying it out, its actually very well done. The typing is very fast and predictions are spot on. I've been typing this whole body of text on it and haven't had the need to stop and back up and rewrite everything 5 times as I was getting with the older keyboard. The new swipe style keyboard just works out of the box with no real need to configure. I figured it would be pretty hard to use, but its amazingly gratifying and easy to type out large amounts of text with just a thumb or index finger.

Overall I'm quite blown away by this phone and pleased to make the switch from iOS land to this phone.

I'm sorry for everyone's issues not receiving their phones or even being able to order, but trust me everyone, it's worth it!

I'd be happy to answer anyone's questions here. Feel free to ask away.




EDIT 1: I've taken some makeshift photo quality tests between my iPhone 4s and the Nexus 4. Here are the results in medium to low light..  http://imgur.com/a/fDQuh

ALSO: I came from an AT&amp;T iPhone Microsim. I got a test MicroSim from T-Mobile in my area to test their coverage, and also I Installed my AT&amp;T sim it into my Nexus 4 to try out the same network. I was immediately pleased to notice the following:

iPhone on AT&amp;T : Full Bars - 3G status - 99ping - 1150kbps download - 146kbps upload

Nexus 4 on T-Mobile : 2-3 bars - 3G and sometimes H - 1434ping - 10945kbps Download - 1346kbps Upload

Nexus 4 on the same AT&amp;T plan and Microsim as the iPhone - Full Bars H - 87ping - 12376kbps Download - 1108kbps Upload

So it looks like my old iphone wasn't making the most of the data available.  

I also did some preliminary WiFi tests, I have a 100MBPS up/down Fibre connection routed through a router that does not bottleneck that speed.

iphone would constantly get around 25-30Mbps up and down

Nexus 4 gets well over 40Mbps constantly.

quality antennae for the win!

Please stop the rooting circlejerk. There's a time and place for rooting. Don't just jump to it for every damn question. Try to address the needs/question of the user first. And if it can't be met without rooting, then go ahead and suggest rooting. Especially when it comes to non-geek Android newbies.

We get it, you are super duper uber cool and you can root your phone. Now answer the damn question that the poster is asking.

A good phone shouldn't need maintenance/administration for it to work well and work properly. In my case, I already fuck with the kernel all day at work. When I'm using a phone, I want it to just work. For non-geeks, they don't care to have to maintain their phone. So, it gets annoying when ""root it"" is the answer to every damn fuckin question.

**So, please don't jump to rooting for every question. You are just tarnishing the image of Android by making it look like it has to be rooted for anything to work properly. Is that what you want to do?** Android is not iOS, where you can't do some of the trivial shit without jailbreaking it. Don't make Android look like that to an inexperienced user.

For example, there are good reasons to suggest rooting:

* Wanting to remove OEM skin or removing junk apps (if poster says they are not happy with using a different launcher and just disabling the bloatware apps in settings).
* Wanting to selectively give apps permissions.
* Serious security flaw that the user wants to fix immediately (like the Exynos one).

I have seen people suggest rooting for simple questions that it's very clear that they are just jerking themselves off. For example, one poster was asking how to reduce the screen brightness to below what his phone allowed. Answer given: Root it. My thought: Fuck no! There are so many apps for that! I have seen many other such cases, but they aren't coming to mind right now.

1355938315.0	1548fn	Sometimes a satisfied customer needs to be heard too.	Konradov	133	22	71	"My Nexus 4 arrived late last week. It's the best phone I've ever used.

I've owned a few phones throughout the years. I started with the HTC Droid Eris, upgraded two years later to an HTC Incredible 2. 
I grew frustrated with my phones getting left behind, so I upgraded to a Galaxy Nexus and now, a year later - I'm holding a Nexus 4 in my hand.

It's a straight up premium phone.

*Appearance and feel:* It's light, and it's solid to hold. A pleasure. The back is classy as fuck, and the phone beautifully changes from a solid black to a slight, buisness-like shimmer. Like a leather couch in your hand.
The Galaxy Nexus had a tendency to feel loose and frail, especially with the paper-thin back plate. Nexus 4 is all solid, no bullshit.

My side buttons are weird, and I don't like them. Compared to the GNex or especially iPhones, they feel loose and unsatisfying. I don't know if it's an issue with my phone, or the design, but it makes a difference.


*Display:* It's boss. The Galaxy Nexus had an awesome screen, but I belong to the crowd that is bothered by Pentile. It's amazing how clean and smooth everything is on this phone.
Surprisingly enough, I assumed that the soft-buttons wouldn't look good compared to the GNex, but on all but the brightest settings, the blacks are black enough to blend with the bezel as well as before.

I think it's fair to say that iPhones have some of the best displays around, and side-by-side, the two are on equal footing. The Nexus 4 gets some slack for warmer colors, but I think it's just that - a different temperature. I like it, but it didn't take much to simply change values around to match iPhone levels of saturation.


*Performance*: Holy balls. I thought the GNex was fast. What's there to say, benchmarks tell one story - usage tells another. It's as smooth as a baby's bottom, I have yet to encounter website stutter. The Amazing Spider-Man, Max Payne, GTA III, Dead Trigger all run fantastically on the highest settings.

Oh, it does get very warm. Not quite hot, it's not a pain to hold, but it's unpleasant and it's noticeable. Compare this to an iPhone 5 which performs the same tasks with equal performance, but remains pleasantly at a cool-to-room temperature.


*Battery*: I'm still doing unscientific tests with kernels, and settings. The battery isn't worse than with the GNex, but it could be a lot better. The phone gets me through a day of usage so far, and I browse the web lots. I have to re-charge it by early evening, but I try not to let it drop below 10% battery.

It's not a comfortable amount of battery, but I have yet to use a device that has plenty of it. The drain is always there at the back of my mind, and I'm never certain if it'll be enough.

1361046582.0	18njqa	The Nexus 4 on Straight Talk Guide	rbelmont	141	37	62	"You already have the best Smartphone available... highest quality display, with an up-to-the-second current version of Android, and the snappiest UI available.  But imagine that your service provider just offered to cut your annual bill by about $1,000, while still giving you (mostly) unlimited data, and then throwing in unlimited text and talk just for good measure?  Too good to be true?  Not if you have a Nexus 4 and move from a contract, to pre-paid on Straight Talk.

**How do I save $1,000 per year?**

For the uninitiated, Straight Talk is a [mobile virtual network operator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_virtual_network_operator) (MVNO).   An MVNO buys capacity on someone else's network (e.g. AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, etc.).  They negotiate wholesale rates, and then they chop up that capacity and resell it to consumers.  In other word's they're a middle man... they don't own a network, or towers... they don't build infrastructure.  They just repackage the capacity, and pass cost savings on to end-users.  And yes... believe it or not, it's actually a thing.

**And this saves me money?**

You've probably seen the ads for pre-paid wireless... be it [Straight Talk]( http://straighttalk.com), or Virgin Mobile, or [one of dozens of different MVNOs]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_mobile_virtual_network_operators) that offer $45-$50 per month for unlimited everything...  that can't possibly be true, right?   There's got to be some catch... because who in their right might would pay double that for their AT&amp;T contract?  Well, by the numbers the vast majority do.  In fact, despite trailing Verizon by 20 million wireless subscribers in Q1, 2013... AT&amp;T is expected to add another 475,000 new customers this quarter!  What's that worth?  Well, it's worth more than $38 million per month to them!  Why?  simply because most people won't consider a pre-paid option, like Straight Talk.  (And now you also know how Verizon and AT&amp;T can afford to pay such high dividends to their stockholders).

**Yes, but is it really unlimited everything?**

Good question - and there are some caveat's if you read Straight Talk's terms and conditions.  The one that has the potential to impact most folks is the ""unlimited"" [web-browsing]( http://addicted-to-it.blogspot.com/2013/02/nexus-4-straight-talk-part-4-data-usage.html)... which is in fact, different from unlimited data.  *""So what's the distinction?""*  Well, you can check the link for the details but the short of it is that you shouldn't stream video (much), and you should pay attention to your data usage.  At the risk of oversimplifying... unlimited web-browsing translates into ""don't abuse your data plan""...   which if you're looking for a real-world guideline actually means... keep it to 2GB per month, or not much more than 100mb on any given day.  So the next question many folks ask, is *""Is that alot""*, or *""What's typical?""*.  Most customers on either AT&amp;T or T-Mobile don't reach a 2GB per month.  And [only 4% of AT&amp;T customers use more than 3GB]( http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/unlimited-unnecessary-npd-report-finds-average-smartphone-data-use-below-2/2012-08-24).   The story might be a little dated, so I also conduced an unscientific survey of folks working in a technology company... all had Smart Phones, and all were in the age range of 28- 40 years of age.  Guess what they used?  The average range was between 700MB - 1.2GB per month.

**What does this have to do with a Nexus 4?**

Google's Nexus 4 is a carrier unlocked GSM phone.  If you're [here]( http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4), then you probably already know that.  And if you don't, Brian over at [Anandtech]( http://www.anandtech.com/show/6440/google-nexus-4-review#)  does a good job of explaining why it's a great phone.  Of particular note is the [zerogap]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=331MsHlnG5I) LCD display.  In case you weren't aware, unlike the Galaxy SIII, the Nexus 4 does not have a Super AMOLED display.  Since the Nexus 4 is manufactured by the king of LCD production, LG has managed to squeeze every lost drop of LCD goodness out of the aging technology (while yields are still ramping up on the OLED manufacturing).  For those unfamiliar with [GSM]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM ) it means that the phone will work darn near anywhere on earth that has a cell phone carrier, and all you need to do is grab a prepaid SIM card on a local carrier's network.  Prepaid SIM cards are common just about everywhere in the world, expect for the US (though via MVNO's, they're becoming more common).  *So in the United States, why does this matter*..  For starters, it's now [illegal]( http://www.tuaw.com/2013/01/25/unauthorized-unlocking-of-new-phones-to-be-illegal-in-u-s/) to unlock a locked phone without the carrier's permission.  Crazy, right?  AT&amp;T and T-Mobile are the two major GSM-based networks in the United States.  So, with a Nexus 4 -available at [the Google Play store]( https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_4_8gb) you can buy a $300 phone without a carrier subsidy, a phone nearly identical to the unlocked $750 (retail) LG Optimus G.  Why the difference?  Long story short... the Nexus 4 doesn't have 4G LTE coverage capability [anymore ;)](http://www.androidcentral.com/android-422-ota-nexus-4-go-and-here-s-your-download-link)...  it's limited to 3G (but can do HSPA+).  There are rumors that Google is selling the phone at cost, or perhaps at a [loss]( http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/google-nexus-4-1108999/review), but it may just be that the margins are higher on phones than what some folks anticipated.  Whatever the case, it's a great phone for only $100 more than what would be the typical carrier subsidy.

**What does YOUR contract cost?**

I hate spending money on things that I don't need, especially things with a monthly recurring cost.  Going back and looking at my cell phone bill from 2001 (because, yes... I do keep cell phone bills from a decade ago - doesn't everyone?), I was amazed... my bill was about $45 a month through Sprint.  Given inflation, it must have gone up... so factoring 3% annual inflation, my bill should on the order of $61 a month.  But no, my bill was about $90 per month, and when I add a second line, data, text ... I was paying $167 a month ... so about $2,000 a year for my mobile communication ""needs"".  Now, I don't know where you live, or what you do for a living but $2k a year for a couple of cell phones is kind of a lot, right?  20 years ago the things barley existed, and in the intervening decades I've stacked up monthly-recurring cost  upon cost... cable, ISPs, cell phones, text messaging, Netflix, and maybe even a plain-old phone line... when you add it all up, you're looking at the cost of a BMW 3-Series lease ($310 per month) spent solely on communication needs! So **could I actually have been consuming a luxury German sports sedan worth of communication needs every month?**  Probably not.  But make no mistake... I was certainly paying for it. 

**So what's the plan?**

As you may have figured out by now, [my plan]( http://addicted-to-it.blogspot.com/2013/01/save-1000-year-by-buying-nexus-4-and.html) was to buy a pair of Nexus 4 phones, and then [port my numbers] (http://addicted-to-it.blogspot.com/2013/01/save-1000-year-by-buying-nexus-4-and.html) from AT&amp;T to Straight Talk. My goal was to save on the order of $1,000 per year by doing so.  With both of those steps having been completed, and a month or two having passed, I've started to [get a sense]( http://addicted-to-it.blogspot.com/2013/02/nexus-4-straight-talk-part-3-month-in.html) of what it's like being on a pre-paid plan.

**So how does Straight Talk work, and how's the coverage?**

Remember how I said Straight Talk is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), that resells the big carrier's infrastructure?  Well, that means that the coverage is just about the same on whichever parent network that you use.  What I mean by that is this... if you have a Nexus 4 already, then you have an unlocked GSM phone already.  And that means you just need to pick-up a Straight Talk SIM card... either an AT&amp;T Compatible SIM Card, or a T-Mobile Compatible SIM card - either will work in your Nexus 4.  For me, I know I have good AT&amp;T coverage - because I was an AT&amp;T customer for more than 5 years.  When I went over to Straight Talk, I chose an AT&amp;T Compatible Card.  In other words, my  Straight Talk coverage is the same coverage I'd get on AT&amp;T.  So when I'm on the road, I have the same great coverage in most places (and the exact same dead spots as I did before).  Oh, and if you've researched this in the past, you might have read that there's no roaming.  Which is true, and might be problematic if you were using a CDMA phone on Straight Talk.  But you're not... you're using the Nexus 4, and you're using either AT&amp;T or T-Mobile... and in the case of the former, the network is massive.  So unless you're out of the country you really don't  need to worry about roaming if AT&amp;T has descent coverage where you live and work.    

**This sounds complicated.**  

You know what, I thought the exact same thing before I switched.  In fact, I started looking into pre-paid options in 2010 before re-upping with AT&amp;T.  Do you want to know why I didn't switch to a pre-paid plan then?  I thought it was too complicated... and simply not worth my time for what I thought would be a meager savings.  It's not that there weren't enough cell phone network options, or that I couldn't afford an unsubsidized new phone.  I just thought it wasn't worth the irritation.  The reality?  I'm saving [at least $829 per year]( http://addicted-to-it.blogspot.com/2013/02/nexus-4-straight-talk-part-3-month-in.html) on Straight Talk over my prior AT&amp;T plan, and I use my phone more than I used to.

**Okay fine - maybe it's not too complicated, but isn't it only for phone geeks?**  

No... in fact, it's probably better for you if you're not a phone geek.  Why is that?  Because many phone geeks spend way too much time on their phones, and as a result they tend to use way too much data.  Remember how I talked about the limits up in the above sections?  Well, there are penalties for being irresponsible with your [data usage]( http://addicted-to-it.blogspot.com/2013/02/nexus-4-straight-talk-part-4-data-usage.html), but as I mentioned... the vast majority of folks don't use even 2GB of data per month.  If you don't know how much data you're using, and have a Nexus 4... click Settings&gt;Data Usage... and check your data usage and the break-down by application.  Go back a few months as well... more than 2GB per month?  Probably not.  If you're on AT&amp;T or T-Mobile, you can also check the web-site and see what you've been using.  

**Where are the correct APN settings?**

Straight Talk keeps the APN settings [here](http://www.straighttalksim.com/support.php).  But here's a quick-reference:

Name: Straight Talk, APN: att.mvno, Proxy: Not Set, Port: 80, Username: Not set, Password: Not set, Server: Not Set, MMSC: http://mmsc.cingular.com, MMS Proxy: 66.209.11.33, MMS port: 80, MCC: 310, MNC: 410, Authentication Type: Not Set, APN Protocol: IPv4, APN roaming protocol: IPv4, Bearer: Unspecified).

**What's the verdit?**

I'm a couple months into the switch to Straight Talk on my Nexus 4, and am on track to save over $829 this year.  It's not painful, and it's not a scam.  Knowing the above helps... and knowing even more can help save you time and hassle.  If you're still worried about your data usage, coverage, or are just looking for a quick-start read-on.

So, between co-workers, friends, and Facebook I've had tons of people asking me about my Straight Talk experience.  So much so, that I wrote this guide and put together a [series of my blog posts](http://addicted-to-it.blogspot.com/2013/02/how-to-save-1000-year-on-your-cell.html). I hope this these help folks out.  If you're looking for more though, I'm about to release an eBook on the topic, and am trying to gauge the level of interest folks have.  So, if you'd be interested in being notified when the book is released, please [sign-up](http://eepurl.com/ufuxH) to be notified.  You can [unsubscribe](http://blogspot.us6.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u=f198b6c0bcc02cd12df3a604c&amp;id=12e9865737) anytime, and I'll never use your address for spam.  In the book, I cover everything... from irritating gotchas and the stuff you wish you'd have known before you started, to the important things like number ports, keeping your data usage under the radar, how small businesses can use Straight Talk... etc.  even to the direction of the industry.  Let me know if you're interested in more info, or if you have any questions!

1353179074.0	13d18v	Here are two posts that may explain what is happening to those of us who are in limbo with shipping [US]	neotopian	124	22	67	"Saw two posts on the xda forum:

**First one:**

&gt;I just spoke with a CSR, our 5 minute conversation started at 08:42 PST. I confirmed with him that he actually had my order number in front of him (had him read off the last 4 digits). I was polite and courteous, but pushed him for information or another individual to talk to if he did not have it.
&gt;
&gt;He had no information. After him asking me if I received a BO email and my replying no, he said that was good news, and that my order would be shipping monday or tuesday. The rest of the conversation was mostly ""I am sorry, we had a lot of orders, there getting to them as fast as they can"" over and over.
&gt;
&gt;UPS is handling all of the order fulfillment for them in a UPS warehouse. They are breaking down the orders as they see fit according to their own logistics. Google has no control over it, and no information until UPS sends them shipment confirmation and tracking number.
&gt;
&gt;We'll either get them monday or tuesday or we won't... but Google will not be able to tell us until after it is on its way.
&gt;
&gt;The only real piece of info I have is that if you got a BO email, well... that's bad news. Not saying it won't ship, but it is somehow ""bad news"".

[Source](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=34270718&amp;postcount=14234)

**Second one (a reply to the above):**

&gt;It is a guess... but a pretty informed guess. My brother has been a manager in shipping logistics for decades, and the following is the most likely scenario for these rollouts (I have experienced the same with Apple on numerous occasions - except they use FedEx):
&gt;
&gt;Google is not fulfilling these orders. They hired a subcontractor (UPS Logistics) to do it, and that is why everything originates from their main hub in KY, and why Google CSR's don't have any direct access to information as to just what is happening. It also explains why there were NO shipping option.
&gt;
&gt;UPS received the product (in palettes) from the vendor (Korea), passed it all through customs, and received an order manifest from Google. If there were 50,000 units, that manifest should have contained the first 50,000 orders. At that point, UPS breaks the palettes down and ships it all out as they see fit. This is where the logistics come in. The orders are filled based on destination and not FIFO. Whether you're shipped first or last is due simply to UPS' routing network and transportation management. UPS then sends fulfillment info back to Google for billing and customer notification. This is why some folks saw tracking straight from UPS (with MyChoice) before Google could relay it.
&gt;
&gt;Now as to why the first early orders (mine was at 08:33:53 PST) have seem to be universally in limbo... this is where Google may have sheet the bed, and simply may not have included them on the manifest. I dunno... Maybe the first batch of orders went awol in their systems for some reason. Of course Google may have F'd up the manifest in other ways as well, but once the manifest was sent, and their subcontractor went to work, they had no control over the fulfillment process. When you hire a roofer, and pick out such and such shingles, you can't just change your mind halfway thru the roofing job.
&gt;
&gt;There is nothing wrong with how they choose to do this. This kind of sub-contractor arrangement speeds getting thru customs as well as transportation time and lowers costs. But if Google botched the manifest, well that might explain why folks that really should have been fulfilled from this batch may not be.

You can view the original post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/14nyro/eli5_moving_from_sprint_to_tmobiles_nocontract/c7etyut) if you want to see the surrounding discussions, but that one will receive no further edits or updates. 

So, hello, new Nexus 4 owners! For many of you, this will be your first prepaid phone. You now truly own *your* device, and the carriers are now courting *you*! You have many options at your disposal, such as [StraightTalk](http://www.straighttalk.com), [Net10](http://www.net10wireless.com/), [Solavei](http://www.solavei.com/), and our old friends, [AT&amp;T](http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/plans/prepaidplans.html), and [T-Mobile](http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-plans).

Since the biggest advantage of having carriers courting you is saving money, I'm going to discuss a particular plan on that last carrier, T-Mobile, as I feel it offers the absolute cheapest and best 4G service for your money. I'm going to show you how to get unlimited voice, data, and text, for *less than* $30. Please note my guide is only meant as a ""quick start"" guide. There are much more in depth articles that you can use, and I will link them to you shortly. So let's get started!

First things first, ideally, you will activate a brand new line, and if you care about keeping your current number, [port it into Google Voice](http://support.google.com/voice/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1065667). This costs $20. If you don't care, just create a new Google Voice account - you're going to end up with two numbers, a carrier number and a GV number, but ideally you will only ever use your Google Voice number. This has *many* benefits, summarized [here in a flashy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZU7BOeQ58) and [here in text](http://www.google.com/googlevoice/about.html), but the primary motivation for us is flexibility, not the least of which is the ability to use Google Voice as a seamless way to make calls over data.

*Some things to be aware of, if you choose to port to Google Voice* - The process can take anywhere from 20 minutes to 72 hours, and there's no way of really knowing how long it will be. Typically you will see voice service begin working first, but SMS may take several more hours or even a day or so. It all depends on your timing, what carrier you have, what plan/contract you have, etc.

The other one - *and this is a big one for some people* - is that Google Voice does NOT support MMS! You will be able to text and call, but you CANNOT send or receive MMS, and that includes Group Messages from iPhone users and such (The *only* exception to this being picture MMS messages sent from users on the Sprint network; Sprint has a special arrangement with Google Voice and, among other things, one of those abilities is automatic translation from an MMS to an e-mail. The message will arrive in your Gmail account with the picture attached.) *I do not personally find this to be a big deal.* The simple fact of the matter is that MMS is a dated, horrible way to transfer media - It squashes your pictures to tiny resolutions, it transcodes your audio to garbage, it generally ruins everything you send through it. It was built for a time when phones had 160x160 screens that barely qualified as ""color,"" and it's changed little ever since; it's really badly dated in a time when nearly everyone carries a high resolution, high DPI smartphone. To get around this, I simply use [Facebook Messenger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.orca&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsImNvbS5mYWNlYm9vay5vcmNhIl0.), [Google+](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.plus&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5nb29nbGUuYW5kcm9pZC5hcHBzLnBsdXMiXQ..), [Gmail](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gm&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5nb29nbGUuYW5kcm9pZC5nbSJd), or if none of that is an option, upload the image to [imgur](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imgurforandroid&amp;feature=search_result) and simply paste the link over. For group messaging, I use [GroupMe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.groupme.android&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5ncm91cG1lLmFuZHJvaWQiXQ..) or the Circles feature in Google+ - apps like [WhatsApp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS53aGF0c2FwcCJd) are popular choices as well, but it depends on how many of your friends can be bothered to install them.

Regardless of whether you port or not, purchase the SIM from [here.](http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-phone/T-Mobile-Micro-SIM-Card-Activation-Kit) (The price changes on these often; they've gone from $0.99 to free to $10. Currently, you can use the code '**SIMSALE**' to get 90% off.)

You can look around online for a deal on a refill card (CallingMart used to offer them, as did prepaid-refill.com, but currently they are not offering any discounts that I can find.)

Activate your phone using the normal instructions on the [T-Mobile website](http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-activate); you will need your SIM card info, your phone IMEI, and the PIN code you received from your refill card. Once activated, you will have an account with something like $3 and change on it, but no service; you can either do a ""fund your account"" thing on the website and select the ""Redeem a refill card"" to enter a prepaid refill code, you can do the normal payment direct to T-Mobile.

Again on the ""if you want to,"" [here is my T-Mobile Referral link](http://mbsy.co/fcpM). When you sign up this way, we *both* get $15 back (up to $25 if you choose a different plan) after your second month, so it's a good deal for both of us.

Log into Google Voice and add this phone. Now, voicemail won't integrate with the T-Mobile prepaid accounts. You'll get an error during setup about that, and again if you try to click the ""Activate voicemail on this phone"" thingie in Google Voice. No big deal; all you need to do is call T-Mobile and have them disable voicemail on your account. Google Voice will then pick up as normal, and you'll just get your voicemails through the Voice app. *The only thing this affects is when people call your carrier number* (which they won't be doing in this scenario) *they will get no voicemail at all.* Calls going to your GV number will work exactly like you'd expect; Voice will pick up just fine, they will leave their message, you'll get a notification from the Google Voice app (which also integrates directly into the dialer in Android 4.2, a nice touch! View Call history to play the voicemail that call left.)

While you've got T-Mobile on the phone, tell them to disable their Web Guard bullshit, too, because we're all grown ass adults and can look at porn and guns and Facebook if we goddamn well want to (seriously, it blocks Facebook by default.)

Bam! You've got 4G service with unlimited texting, Visual Voicemail, multi-location support, etc, for *less than* $30 every month! You can just stop here if 100 minutes is enough for you, or you can install Vonage and use that for outgoing calls to save some minutes there - Vonage is currently offering 3,000 minutes of outbound calling per month, just for installing their app.

Don't forget that if even, say, 200 minutes is more your speed, you can still just toss an extra $10 in there and you're *still going to save money* over any other carrier or plan; the cost over overage is $0.10 per minute.

But what if you need more? Well, you've got another option now; you can set up [GrooveIP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gvoip&amp;hl=en) to do both incoming and outgoing calls via Google Talk - just remember to answer the call with GrooveIP. But that costs $5, and we're fucking cheapskates! Another alternative is [Talkatone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.talkatone.android), which has a subscription based pricing structure to remove the ads, support multiple Google Voice accounts, and improve quality. How much improved quality? I don't know. But there's another option...

Is coverage really good in your area? Do you spend most of your time on WiFi? OK. To fix that low minute thing, you're going to want to get into SIP calling. There's excellent guides on that [here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1646755) and [here.](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1791957) READ THEM THOROUGHLY. It is complicated stuff but you need to understand how all this works if you are committing to this!

The very first thing you'll need to do is get your contacts cleaned up for SIP dialing. SIP dialing demands that numbers be dialed in their *full international format.* You can use [Contact Cleanup](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.peterbaldwin.client.android.cleanup&amp;hl=en) to format your contact numbers properly in one click; select the +XXXXXXXXXXXX format (the very bottom option.) Android will space this back out to the more readable ""+XX XXX XXX XXXX"" format all on it's own.

Now, to actually set up SIP calling - In short, install [SipDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sipdroid.sipua&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm9yZy5zaXBkcm9pZC5zaXB1YSJd) and use it's ""New Pbxes Account"" wizard, which will create a new Pbxes.org account and link it to Google Voice. If it's having trouble connecting, enable ICE and see if that helps (ICE allows it punch through firewalls better) and if not, look around for how to setup STUN server (Google ""public stun server"" if nothing else.) Once it's able to connect and register itself, you'll want to log into [Pbxes.org](https://www1.pbxes.com/index_e.php) and fill in the Personal Data section - **THIS IS IMPORTANT** - Pbxes.org will delete your account if you don't do so! The one other thing we want to do here is enable Call Waiting. To do that, click Extensions, select the ""SipDroid &lt;200&gt;"" extension, and click the 'Call Waiting' box. The other thing we will want to do here is enable Audio Bypass - This is necessary for the CallCentric configuration we will be setting up in a few moments, and finally, disable the Voicemail option - we want Google Voice to pick up, not Pbxes clunk ass VM system.

**A NOTE FOR PEOPLE USING TWO-FACTOR GOOGLE AUTHENTICATION**: You have to do another step here if you are using two-factor auth - Go to your [Google Application Specific Passwords](https://accounts.google.com/b/0/IssuedAuthSubTokens#accesscodes) and create a new password specifically for Pbxes.org. Copy the password, go to your Pbxes.org account, go to Trunks, and select the Gtalk trunk. Here you need to enter the password given. Failure to add this will result in you being able to receive incoming calls, but no ability to make Outgoing.

I personally like CSipSimple a little bit more. To use that, remove SipDroid, [install CSipSimple](http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/) - link goes to the Nightly which is usually well ahead of the [Play Store version.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.csipsimple&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5jc2lwc2ltcGxlIl0.) but you can use either one. Log into the Pbxes.org account that you created with SipDroid and look under the ""Extensions"" part, and go back to the 'SipDroid &lt;200&gt;' extension. Click that and make a note of the username there - it will look like xxxxx-200. *Change the password to something you will remember!* Now go into CSipSimple, do the Add Account thing, go under ""World Wide Providers"" and select Pbxes.org. Enter the xxxxx-200 username and password (for your extension, NOT your Pbxes.org account!) and add it. It should register and then you're done. If CSipSimple will not register and just times out, try enabling ICE and/or setting up a STUN server (personally, just turning on ICE has worked for me almost everywhere.)

Now when you dial out you will get a prompt on whether you want to dial with CSipSimple or via your carrier. If you want a more streamlined method, open CSipSimple, go to Settings, and go to Filters. Go into Pbxes.org and add a filter for ""All."" Change the condition to ""Directly Call"" and set it to ""All."" Now go ino ""Use Mobile"", set it to ""Directly Call,"" and add a filter for ""Ends with +."" This way, when you hold zero before dialing a call with the native dialer, it will call over cellular. If you just dial the number with no + at the end, it will call over SIP. The last thing you want to do is exclude 911 - Set a filter under Use Mobile for Directly Call, Is Exactly, 911.

To improve quality, we'll use the free provider [CallCentric](http://www.callcentric.com/), which gives us some advantage on being able to use superior codecs like iLBC. Head over here and click the ""Sign Up"" link, verify your email, etc. After signing in, click the Products link, then select ""Free Phone Number."" Go through the steps to find a New York number (only NY numbers are offered; this doesn't matter since we'll be using our Google Voice number.) When asked if you are going to be using the service within the US, select NO - this is for 911 Administrative Fees, and we will NOT be using this line for emergency services. After ""purchasing"" the free number, click the ""Click Here to Setup Call Forwarding"" (or go to your Preferences, and select the DID Forwarding tab.) Here we will click the place where you can enter info, and enter your pbxes.org SIP address - &lt;accountname&gt;@pbxes.org.

For codecs, I prefer the iLBC codec. To set this, I use the following settings, in those order:

Fast Networks:

* PCMU 8KHZ
* ILBC 8KHZ
* speex 8KHZ
* GSM 8KHZ

Slow Networks:

* ILBC 8KHZ
* speex 8KHZ
* GSM 8KHZ

speex and GSM are included for fall-back negotiation only; ideally we only ever want to use PCMU or iLBC.

The last thing we need to do is set Google Voice to ring our CallCentric number instead of Google Talk or our cell phone. To do this, we will log back in, add the CallCentric number and uncheck the ""receive text messages box."" You will be prompted to verify your number; if everything is working correctly, you'll get a call and your first sample of what voice quality will be like on SIP. Verify your number, then uncheck the boxes to forward to your carrier number as well as Google Talk.

Some tests you can do:

*43 (pbxes echo test)

(909) 390-0003 (PSTN echo test)

(408) 647-4636 (record/playback)

Literally the only difference are the filenames in the pictures, so don't be confused by that. All the directions are the same.  - February 14, 2013.**  

As requested, this guide is the opposite of my previous guide [found here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/14kghb/how_to_unlockroot_your_nexus_4_with_adb_a/). By following these steps, you will completely restore your Nexus 4 to stock, locking the bootloader, unrooting, and essentially turning it back to how it was when you first bought it.  

**This guide works on Windows, Mac, and Linux PCs.**

-----  
-----  
-----  

**ASSUMPTIONS**  

* You already have the correct drivers for your phone set up. If you do not, please refer to the previous guide!  

* You already have the Android SDK installed, and can use fastboot (ie. you know where you installed it!) If you do not, the instructions on how to install them (on Windows, at least) are on the previous guide!   

* You have an archive manager installed that can extract from a .tgz file. **I recommend either [7zip, which can be found here,] (http://www.7-zip.org/download.html) or [WinRAR, which can be found here] (http://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&amp;L=0).** I believe OSX and definitely any Linux machine can do this out of the box, but if necessary these two programs run on both.  

-----  
-----  
-----  


**PART 1**

1) Download the Android Factory Image for the Nexus 4 [found here] (https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images#occam). Note that as 
time passes and newer versions of Android are released, there will be more factory images to choose from. Simply pick the one with the latest version number (at the time of this writing, that would be 4.2.2).  

2) Locate the downloaded file  

* For example: occam-jdq39-factory-345dc199.tgz (at the time of this writing, this is the most recent factory image).

3) Right click the file, select 7-Zip or WinRAR, then select [**Open Archive**](http://i.imgur.com/sxBuJ.jpg).

3a) Extract the folder called  

&gt;occam-jdq39  

to your desktop (again: note that this folder may be called something different when a newer factory image is released)

4) Open the folder you made on your desktop, and move ALL of these files to your ""Platform-Tools"" folder where your Android SDK is installed. (This is the same folder where you performed the fastboot commands in the previous guide, and where you can find ""fastboot.exe"" and ""adb.exe."")  

**Everything is now set up and you are ready to begin unrooting/relocking your phone!**

-----  
-----  
-----  


**PART 2**

1) Turn on USB Debugging on your phone (Settings --&gt; Developer Options --&gt; USB Debugging). (If you do NOT see a ""Developer Options"" in Settings, then you must go to Settings --&gt; About Phone, scroll down to the bottom, and tap on the ""Build Number"" section 7 times. A pop-up should show telling you that you are ""now a developer."" Yay!)  

2) Open the Android SDK/Platform-Tools folder  

2a) Press and hold **Shift** and **Right click**  

2b) Select “Open command window here”

3) In the command prompt, type  

&gt;**adb reboot bootloader**  

-----
----**PICK 4a or 4b DEPENDING ON YOUR OS!**----  

-----

4a) **WINDOWS**: Once your phone reboots into the bootloader: type  

&gt;flash-all.bat  

4b) **LINUX/MAC**: Once your phone reboots into the bootloader: type  

&gt;flash-all.sh  


5) Your phone will reboot when this process is finished. This whole process may take a while so please be patient! 

6) Once your phone restarts and goes through the setup screens, turn on USB Debugging again.  

7) Connect your phone. In the command prompt, type:  

&gt;**adb reboot bootloader**  

8) Once your phone boots into the bootloader, type:  

&gt;**fastboot oem lock**  

**Your phone is now unrooted and locked and back to it's factory state!** These steps can restore your phone if it won't boot up or a number of other issues.

-----  
-----  
-----  

* Much, much shorter than the previous guide. Google was kind enough to include a flash-all script in the factory image zip.  

* If you are curious, the ""flash-all"" script actually does this set of commands for you:  

&gt;fastboot flash bootloader bootloader-mako-makoz10o.img  

&gt;fastboot reboot-bootloader  

&gt;sleep 5  

&gt;fastboot flash radio radio-mako-m9615a-cefwmazm-2.0.1700.48.img  

&gt;fastboot reboot-bootloader  

&gt;sleep 5  

&gt;fastboot -w update image-occam-jdq39.zip  

which is why you need all of these files in the Platform-Tools folder.

**YOU MUST BE ROOTED IN ORDER TO DO THIS**  
**YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WIPE YOUR PHONE**

If you are not rooted then go to this link:

[Nexus 4 Toolkit on the XDA Forum](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1995688)

Here is a link to common terminology when it comes to rooting and flashing ROM's:

[Android ROM and rooting dictionary for beginners](http://www.talkandroid.com/guides/beginner/android-rom-and-rooting-dictionary-for-beginners/)

1. Get the .33 radio from [here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2087227). You can do this from your phone or from your computer but if you do use the computer, get it on to your phone. You can do that by just plugging it in and dragging and dropping it on to the phones memory (emulated SD card) or emailing it to yourself and saving it from your email. 

2. Flash that file now by holding the power button down and restarting the phone in recovery. If you do not have that option, hold down the volume buttons (rocker) when you restart your phone. Then it should pop up with a new screen with an Android with his chest open. This is called fastboot and it should look something like [this](http://cdn-static.cnet.co.uk/i/c/blg/cat/mobiles/nexus-4-root/fastboot1.jpg). Use the rocker to navigate to where it says recovery. Press the home button to activate it.

3. Once in recovery, continue using the volume rocker (or touch, depending on the recovery) to navigate to the ""back up and restore"" option. Hit the power button and then navigate to the ""backup"" option and press power. This will backup your phone in case something goes wrong (although it shouldn't). Now go back to the recovery home screen and select the option to flash a .zip. Once there, navigate to where you saved the file on your phone and use the power button (or touch) to have the .zip flashed. The you can wipe both the caches (or not, I don't but when flashing a new ROM you should) and restart your phone. 

4. Download [Root Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.speedsoftware.rootexplorer&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5zcGVlZHNvZnR3YXJlLnJvb3RleHBsb3JlciJd) or [Root Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jrummy.root.browserfree&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5qcnVtbXkucm9vdC5icm93c2VyZnJlZSJd). RE costs a small amount but I like it more so to me it is worth it.

5. Copy this word for word (hold down on it until you have it selected. Use the blue bars to select it all. Press the button that looks like two pieces of paper in the upper right to copy):  
telephony.lteOnGsmDevice=1  
ro.telephony.default_network=9  
ro.ril.def.preferred.network=9   
**PLEASE NOTE** If you flash a new ROM you have to do this again for LTE to automatically be turned on after a regular reboot.  

6. Go into RE or RB and go up to the highest parent folder. Find the folder ""system"" and open it. Then find the file ""build.prop"" and hold down on it to open the options. Press ""Open in Text Editor"" to bring it up in a way you can edit it. 

7. Find the line ""telephony.lteOnCdmaDevice=0"" (should be closer to the bottom than the top) and it looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/QxcrSkN.png), delete it, and replace it (paste it) with the above lines from step five. The end result should look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ER5t30D.png).

8. Save it and make sure it stuck by rechecking the file and seeing those three lines. 

9. Go into your settings, more (under wireless &amp; networks), mobile networks, then access point names. 

10. Edit the name to ""T-Mobile US LTE"", change the  APN to 
""fast.t-mobile.com"", change the APN type to ""default,supl,admin,dun,mms"", and make sure both APN protocols are IPv4/IPv6. Screenshots of what it should look like:  
[Screen 1](http://i.imgur.com/eQo7Rxt.png)  
[Screen 2](http://i.imgur.com/O7OEAXY.png)  
Not on T-Mobile? [Here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1434995) is a link for all the other APN's.  
[Here](http://forums.team-nocturnal.com/forum/nexus-development/nexus-4/nexus-4-general/1781-[apn]-nexus-4-mako-lte-apn-settings) is the APN for AT&amp;T LTE.  
If you find more, let me know and I will add them.  
**NOTE**: As /u/JARofTAR has mentioned, the APN settings IPv4/IPv6 may cause some apps not to load. If you are experiencing this then please select IPv4 only for both and that should be fixed! Otherwise it should not present an issue!

11. MAKE SURE YOU SAVE IT by pressing the upper right settings button and pressing save.

12. Save [this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ttfxcersckup8ml/cwm-mako-NoAudioFixForTMobileUSA.zip) to your phones memory. You have to reflash it every time you flash a new ROM as it is the ""No Audio Fix."" If you do not flash this then when you make calls you will have no audio.  

13. Flash that using the same method in steps two and three. 

14. After reboot you wont see 4G. You need to do the good ol from our Thunderbolt days  (star)#(star)#4636#(star)#(star), go to phone info, then scroll down and change WCDMA to LTE/GSM auto (PRL). Or go into your settings, more (under wireless &amp; networks), mobile networks, Network mode, then selct ""LTE/GSM/WCDMA""

15. Go to your homescreen and [wait for iiiiiiiit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=lwIxIjvvPBE#t=6s) ..... BOOM 4G LTE

Hope this helps! If I need to change anything, feel free to post it here and I will add it or take something out!

http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/1gntt8/planning_to_massproduce_cheap_replacement_back/cam16mj

~~Hey guys,~~

~~My name's Zach, and I, like many of you, managed to smash the back glass on my Nexus 4. Frustrated at the price of replacement OEM glass which would just break again in a few months, I decided instead to fabricate some replacements from a different material. These replacements will, well, *replace* the glass back of the Nexus 4. They will work with the wireless charging and NFC and will not obstruct those. The first batch will be made out of acrylic, but I plan to offer wooden and leather replacements as well if possible.~~

~~I need your help, /r/nexus4. This project needs money to get off the ground, so I have created an [indiegogo campaign](http://igg.me/at/nexus-4-back/x/3607523) to help collect funds. $12 gets you a black acrylic cover, $14 a transparent cover, and $24 a faux blushed aluminum cover. I will add more perks as demand appears for certain materials.~~

~~I also need critique, input, and ideas for the back cover.~~

~~I am a reliable and trustworthy man, I've been a redditor for over a year. My real name is on this project and I provide a direct email address for contact.~~

~~Thank you!~~

~~[**&gt;&gt;&gt; click here to visit the indiegogo campaign and make a contribution or learn more &lt;&lt;&lt;**](http://igg.me/at/nexus-4-back/x/3607523)~~

1372043462.0	1gy2hi	6 Months in review - The Nexus 4	dansskittles	101	21	66	"Its been 5 months to the day that I received my nexus 4, and this is my review.

**Buying it:** I ordered my Nexus 4 on the 27th November, I didn't get it until the 23rd of January. Thats a heck of a wait if you ask me. Google had issues keeping up with the demand, they had issues with their website while processing orders and had to list it as Out of stock more than once. News came out saying that LG was also to blame, as they couldn't manufacture the phones fast enough. Now though they are easily available both in the play store and from T-Mobile and even has the option of a white version.

**The Display:** The display is just beautiful. Dark blacks, vibrant colors, and bright enough to be use out in the sun. Things are crisp and clear. Its a 1280 x 768 px Display, which with onscreen buttons makes it 720p. Now some people say that it's not 1080p, and their right, it isn't. But in my eyes it doesn't need to be. At normal viewing distances seeing individual pixels is just not going to happen. Never once have I thought anything like ""I wish it was 1080p"".

**The Glass:** As everyone knows the Nexus 4 has glass on both sides. Which urges me to say, buy a case... Seriously, its worth the $20. I've dropped and broken a Nexus 4, its truly not as fun thing to do. Protect your device! Okay so beyond being somewhat fragile even sporting Corning's Gorilla glass 2, the back glass as an awesome reflective feature and the from is curved. Its curves are very subtle and both add to the visual sleekness of the phone and are very useful. Swiping in from the sides is easier and feels so much nicer with the curved edges. However this effect is ruined by the aforementioned, putting a case on the phone.

One huge downside I found to the glass is that over time it becomes less slick or slippery. And what I mean by this is, the glass is so smooth, and its easy to slide fingers along, do gestures and play games. However the coating that makes the glass so nice and smooth and slippery does wear over time. I had a spot towards the center of my phone that just doesn't feel like it used to. More grippy, almost stops your finger mid swype.

**Android and the Nexus 4:** So using the phone everyday is great, its fast, enjoyable, and really gets the job done. Running stock android makes things, clutter free / less bloated and this definitely adds to the experience of the phone. Being a Nexus phone, it will also get updates directly from Google. You won't have to wait weeks or months for your carrier to get off their asses to update it. Also being a Nexus phone, its easy to unlock the bootloader, root, and custom rom. With an hour of your time and the click of a few buttons you can be running custom roms that add cool features or improve on performance / battery life. 

**The battery:** Battery life isn't awful, it can last a full day without issues depending on how you use it. Limiting brightness, screen on time, bluetooth... etc will all help make it last as long as it needs to. A lot of people say the battery is awful, which depending on how you use it it can be. But most people shouldn't have to hard of a time keeping it alive during the day. And as always, some custom roms feature improved battery life. However I do recommend bringing a battery backup or charger if you plan on using it to stream multimedia content for extended periods. Even charging for a few minutes can really make it last quite a bit longer.

**Service/Carriers:** The Nexus 4 can be purchased unlocked, or from T-Mobile. If purchased unlocked it can be used on any GSM Carrier. I use T-mobile and live in the Boston area, I have never had an issue using data or making calls however as this is more based on the carrier then the phone, your experience may vary. One huge gripe people have with the Nexus 4 is a lack of LTE. This was not a dealbreaker for me, and honestly HSPA + is pretty great. I stream music while checking email, browsing FB and doing all sorts of other things and never have speed issues.

**Everything else:** The phone is packed with features, some of which are great on paper but not all that useful, like NFC. I personally love NFC and have incorporated into some personal projects. However I can see that its something people wouldn't use all that often. Qi (Chi) Wireless charging is a feature thats just really cool. You never realize how much a pain plugging a phone in is until you don't have to do it anymore. 8 or 16 gb? Thats a question I saw a lot when the device first came out, and a ton of people went for 16 and pushed others to do the same. Now doing so isn't a bad thing, having the space is nice. But to me, not needing it is nicer. The only thing on my Nexus 4 is my apps. All my pictures, videos and songs are all ""cloud"" ( I truly hate that buzzword) based. Now this does mean I need a data connection if I want to use any of it, but its rare for me to be without data or WiFi and I bet it probably is for most of you as well. 

**TLDR:** Overall the phone is rather good, like anything it has its downsides but for the price is rather fantastic. And its just truly beautiful, I don't think there is any phone I would take over this based strictly on design.

First time ever writing a review, so let me know how I did, without ripping my soul to pieces and feeding it to a hungry dog.

1363993700.0	1atthk	Kernel Tweaking for Free - A Dummy's Guide to Init.D Scripts	IAmAN00bie	92	16	5	"So [in this thread] (http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/1aqvuq/ive_been_pulling_my_hair_out_since_launch_trying/) yesterday, I found out that some people wanted to know how to control kernels using scripts. Now, I'm not a pro at all at this, but I've figured out enough to be able to control almost every kernel parameter without the use of apps. I figured that since I learned from the XDA community that I should share what I know.  

I was also getting annoyed with the way people were bashing on Faux for releasing paid apps to control his kernel, as if he was somehow forcing them to pay for his apps to control the kernel. *This is not true at all.* The general rule is that ""if an app can do it, a script can do it too*!""  

*Provided that your kernel supports the tweak in the first place, obviously!  

**PLEASE UPVOTE FOR VISIBILITY!**  

---  
---  
---  

--**Why init.d scripts over kernel apps?**--  

*Advantages*  

- FREE  

- Control ANY and ALL parameters available on your kernel  

- No need for multiple apps to control different parameters, save space on your phone, no worry about apps having to start up on boot and stay on in the background(this shouldn't be a problem if the app is coded properly anyways!)  

- Don't have to wait for kernel apps to update if a new tweak is available. This is especially important to those who don't use a kernel that is directly supported by an app (like Motley's or Harsh's or Matrix's kernels) since there might be a specific tweak that only works on a single kernel so that app doesn't support it.

*Disadvantages*  

- Initial setup  

- Changing parameters slightly more annoying (you have to go in with a file explorer and find the line and edit it, but it's not that bad)  

- You don't support the kernel developer this way :( But don't feel guilty, the kernel devs know and encourage people to use init.d scripts if you can (Faux and Franco are kind enough to tell people where to point to to target new tweaks). This doesn't mean you can't support them through PayPal, though, and I'm sure they would appreciate it.  

---  
---  
---  

--**How do I write init.d scripts?**--  

Well, you obviously don't want to be writing these on your phone itself because your syntax must be perfect and you use a lot of special characters that are just a pain to type on your phone. Thus, I highly, highly recommend you to write this out from your computer (any OS will do). For the sake of this guide **I assume you are running Windows**, *however*, if you are running on a **Mac or Linux** (inb4 Stallman copy-pasta) machine then be glad since you cut down on a few hassles, and you **can skip to the next section** if you wish.  

*n00bish technical explanation ahead, skip if you don't care*  

The reason why Windows has to take an extra step is because of end-of-line character formatting in text files. In Windows text files, when you press the 'return' key ('Enter'), the line ends with both the line feed and carriage return ASCII characters. In Unix text files, lines end with only the line feed character. Because Android scripts assume you are using Unix text file syntax, when the init.d script is run and the illegal carriage return character is read, the script will fail to run. Thus, you have to make sure that your file is properly formatted. Luckily, all it takes is a single click and all should be good.  

*end of n00bish tech explanation*  


-**I have Windows, so what do I need to do?**-  

1) Download and install [NotePad++] (http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.3.1.html).  

- [Here] (http://i.imgur.com/vYdvOSn.png) is what NotePad++ looks like upon opening a file.  

2) *Recommended (thanks jazzboyrules!)* Click on ""Language --&gt; S --&gt; Shell"" and when you write your scripts NotePad++ will automatically color parts of your syntax so it is easier to read.

3) After you finish writing your script (explained in the next part) make sure you click on ""**Edit--&gt;EOL Conversion--&gt;UNIX/OSX Format**"" like in [this picture] (http://i.imgur.com/85sGUDI.png).  

---  
---  
---  

--**Actually writing the scripts**--  

*Note: this only covers the VERY basics of what you need. If you are familiar with Shell scripting, you can make far better scripts than what I'm showing here, however, you don't need a high level of scripting knowledge to control your kernel's parameters so it's not important.*  

**General Syntax**  

1) Open up a text editor (Windows - use NotePad++ as described above). [This is one of my scripts] (http://i.imgur.com/t1lYJOK.png) that you can use as a reference.

2) First line should have a  

&gt;\#!/system/bin/sh  

this allows you to call upon a ton of BusyBox commands (not important to know)  

3) Use Number Signs (\#) to signify 'comments'. These help you remember what the hell a certain line is doing.  

4) Use 'echo' commands and follow the syntax properly to change kernel parameters.  

The general form is as follows:  

&gt;echo 'XXXXXX' &gt; /the/directory/to/where/the/kernel/parameter/is/exposed/in/sysfs  

example:  

&gt;echo 65 &gt; /sys/module/auto_hotplug/parameters/disable_load_threshold  

5) Write a bunch of these echo statements, make sure the syntax is correct, and **save the file WITHOUT an extension**. This means no .txt, no .sh, nothing after the filename. You can do this (on Windows at least) by saving as ""All Type"" or by saving the filename as ""XXXXXXX."" without specifying an extension.

---  
---  
---  

--**Now that your init.d script is written, how do I actually use it on my phone?**--  

There are several requirements that your phone must meet.

1) Your RAMDISK (wtf is this you say? don't worry about it!) must support init.d (to use init.d scripts you must have init.d support, go figure!)  

2) You must have Busybox installed.  

*How do I know if I meet the requirements?*  

- If you are on a non-stock ROM (as in, ANY ROM that's not the stock-out-of-the-box-Google ROM), chances are you already meet both.  

- If, for whatever reason, you don't (or you are on Google's stock and are rooted), then you can install BusyBox using [this handy app] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=stericson.busybox&amp;hl=en) (just click on Smart Install and let it work its magic) and you can get init.d support [through this app] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1933849).  

*Okay, I met the requirements. Where do I put my init.d scripts?*  

- You can either place your init.d scripts in /system/etc/init.d (will NOT survive a nightly ROM update), or you can place them in /data/local/userinit.d/ (WILL survive a nightly ROM update, provided this directory exists for you. If it doesn't just create it!).  

- You MUST change the permissions on these files to -rwxr-xr-x (755) either by using the 'chmod 755 /directory/to/the/initd/script' command in a Terminal app OR by using an app like Solid Explorer and long-pressing on the file, click 'Change' near permissions, and [adjust like so] (http://i.imgur.com/R0fOAdD.png).

My nexus 4 is set to arrive tomorrow, and I want to be ready to install some apps of all varieties (I'll be new to the Play store). What would you consider a must have?

Any suggestions?

Combine this with the fact that Titanium Backup doesn't work until you root, and it can be a hassle.

You can do backups through ADB, but I just went through that process, and I can report that it's pretty shitty. It took a long time, failed a few times, and in the end simply did not restore everything I expected (e.g., my Nova Launcher setup). So even after manually copying my SD contents back and forth, and restoring my ADB backup, not everything is as I left it. Lame.

Also, I'm not sure why, but it did not automatically download all my apps like it did when I first activated my phone. It started, and then halfway through seemed to decide it wasn't worth the effort anymore. So I got half my apps back, and am stuck reinstalling the rest from the Play Store one by one.

So, I really recommend that you unlock your bootloader as soon as you get your phone. It'll save you some trouble later. There's no real downside, and you can always re-lock it later if you want."	t5_2v9bv	True

I shipped it to LG and they quoted $153 for complete repair. Main reason for shipping it to them was for credit card purchase protection coverage so I had a repair bill to submit with the insurance claim.

1354892450.0	14g245	PSA: Nexus 4, AT&amp;T and You - How Not To Get Screwed, and get the best experience possible	the_hillshire_guy	88	16	130	"Since there's only 2 choices in the U.S. (AT&amp;T and T-Mo for first-level carriers - I know, Straight Talk - but that's prepaid) ... it stands to reason a fair number of you will be activating your phones on AT&amp;T's network.

**DO NOT CALL AT&amp;T WITH YOUR NEXUS 4'S IMEI NUMBER**

Reason: As explained in [this XDA thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2021401&amp;highlight=att) the Nexus 4 is not (yet) recognized as a 4G-capable phone on Ma Bell. So the network will default you to a 3G smartphone plan. 

Hopefully, you came from another 4G phone - so you already have a 4G plan on your account. If that's the case, here are the settings you want to use on your phone.

**Setting the APN**

&gt; To get into the APN settings, go into your android settings, &gt; under ""Wireless &amp; Networks"" go into More&gt;Mobile 
&gt; Networks&gt;Access Point Names. You can either select the 
&gt; menu button and create a New APN, or you can select the &gt; one already there and edit it to match the one below.

&gt; Code:
&gt; APN Settings:

&gt; Name: AT&amp;T HSPA+

&gt; APN: pta **(NOTE: IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN LTE PLAN, CHANGE THIS TO ""PHONE"")**

&gt; Proxy: Not set

&gt; Port: Not set

&gt; Username: Not set

&gt; Password: Not set

&gt; MMSC: http://mmsc.mobile.att.net

&gt; MMS Proxy: proxy.mobile.att.net

&gt; MMS port: 80 **(NOTE: IF MMS ISN'T WORKING, CHANGE THIS &gt; TO ""8080"")**

&gt; MCC: 310

&gt; MNC 410

&gt; Authentication type: Not set

&gt; APN type: default,admin,fota,mms,supl,hipri

&gt; APN protocol: IPv4/IPv6

&gt; APN roaming protocol: IPv4/IPv6

&gt; Bearer: Unspecified

Unless you live in Oklahoma City, OK - you likely do not have the band of LTE the Nexus 4 can connect to (Band 4) ... so use:

**APN: phone**

Now, if you came from a 3G-only smartphone, you will need to find a friend with a 4G phone and give at&amp;t this IMEI number. From the anecdotal evidence I've read, this is enough to activate a 4G plan on your account and give you access to HSPA+ speeds.

From what I've read, using somebody else's IMEI number will not affect their account - it will only signal to AT&amp;T's systems that your phone is capable of 4G. However, I have not independently confirmed this so you'll be doing it at your own risk.

You could try to call AT&amp;T or head to a store and plead with them to hook you up. I've read of limited success with this. So it's very YMMV.

Again, to summarize: if you're adding the Nexus 4 to your AT&amp;T account - use the above settings and do not contact AT&amp;T to give them your new IMEI number.

Happy Nexus'ing!"	t5_2v9bv	True

The cause for this concern is that it's the general consensus that these types of posts do not contribute anything valuable to the discussion of the Nexus 4. 

Many subreddits have enacted rules against these posts for similar reasons.

Rather than simply banning these submissions unequivocally, I have decided to leave it up to the community to vote.

Just to make it clear, these are the types of posts that will be included in the poll:

- Memes
- Gifs that do not contain anything directly related to the Nexus 4
- Videos that do not contain anything directly related to the Nexus 4
- Any other images that do not contain anything directly related to the Nexus 4

Keep in mind, this *only* applies to submissions, and not comments.

So...I found an old email that had a link to cancel an order, and used it to cancel both of my pending orders.  The system shows that they were both cancelled.  

Here is a link (with a modified order #) to the cancel page:

I know some people said they were told they couldn't cancel, but this link worked for me.  My Wallet acct now shows ""canceled"" beside of the $ for these two orders.

Hope that helps somebody.  I still think it is crap that they are not sending out phones in order received.

I cracked the screen of my N4 and decided to send it to LG for repair rather than buy the part myself and risk screwing up. the cost was only $20 more to send it out so I thought it made sense.

I first contacted LG early July. I took over 4 days for them just to give me the address to send the phone to. I overnighted it to them and waited a week and a half for a diagnosis. They said the repair would be $153.00 total and put a hold on my bank account. Two days later there were two charges totaling $306.00. I called and after 35 minutes on the phone it was back to only one charge. the site updated 2 days later saying the phone had shipped.

A week later without seeing the phone I called them back to check in and was told that there was no tracking number and they did not know where the phone was but the supervisor would be in soon and to expect a call. 6 hours later i call back and get the same response except this time (after 20 more minutes on hold) i get a supervisor saying the phone is still in the repair department because i had not paid the repair bill. 3 more days of calling my bank, cancelling the old charge accepting the new charge and here i am given 24 hours UNTIL i can pay then they can ship soon and i will get it when it arrives... this whole thing is fucked up. This is mostly a rant but should be out there for people considering sending their phone to LG, think twice. a month is a long time to repair a broken screen."	t5_2v9bv	True

I will see posts talking about 4 hours of screen time with 1 day or more standby time and it got me wondering.  At some point I had seen an XDA thread (that I cant find) suggesting that LG had been using a bad stock image at some point and perhaps that could be part of the issue.  So I decided to revert my phone to stock and do a week long challenge.

For the rest of the week I will run only the stock image (4.2.2) with only the stock applications + Google voice (since I ported my phone number and I need people to be able to call me) and all the stock settings and wifi off.

I will consider this the final test, if I can browse the web and use the core applications that Google provides with a solid 4 hours of screen time and see 24+ hours of standby time then I will be happy.

**Why haven't I gotten the update?**

Google rolls out the update slowly so their servers don't get overloaded. If you wait, you will get it

**Can I force the update?**

Yes, but its basically just giving you another shot at the ""update lottery."" You could do this 50 times and not get the update.

Method to force update:
 
* Go into Setting -&gt; Apps -&gt; All -&gt; Google Services Framework

* You will see a button for “Clear Data”; clear it.

* Go back to Setting -&gt; About Phone -&gt; System updates and then click the check now button.

* Repeat

**Can I manually install 4.2.2 myself?**

Yes, [here are instructions, it is very easy](http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/18hgkw/nexus_4_422_manual_update_instructions_stock/). It is the fastest way for you to get the update.

**Will I lose root if I update?**

If you do the update via the stock method (where it notifies you and you do update), you will lose root. You can maintain root by using the [OTA Rootkeeper app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.projectvoodoo.otarootkeeper&amp;hl=en).

If you do it using CWM, you can have CWM keep root for you, super handy.

**Will I get the update if I have TWRP or ClockworkMod installed?**

Yes you'll get it eventually, but it will wipe TWRP/CWM if you do the update via notification.

You can update it easily by just downloading the zip and flashing it in TWRP/CWM.

**How can we regain root if we've lost it?**

Root it again :)

**Will I lose my LTE?**

Yes, but that can be [fixed](http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/18hg3k/422_disabled_ability_for_lte/)

**I was on Franco Kernel and now the 4.2.2 update is failing. What can I do?""**

Use the Nexus 4 Toolkit to boot into a temporary CWM and then flash [this kernel](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q9s9tou3by72zn8/N4_421_stock_kernel_and_components.zip?m) and [this kernel](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ypo98ncq94h8wy5/Stock%20Kenrel%20Try%202.zip?m)

Then try the update again and enjoy as it completes.

**I'm getting an error about some assert failed when verifying some apk in ""/system/app,"" what do I do?**

This means you deleted a system app that the update is now trying to verify. Download and install that app, and then you need to use a [root file browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acr.rootfilemanager&amp;hl=en) to move that app after it is installed to the location that it is failing verification at, such as ""/system/app/OccamQuickOffice.apk."" Make sure the name is the same. Then you should be able to verify and apply the update.

In the future, instead of deleting system apps, just freeze them using Titanium Backup or Rom Toolbox Pro or etc.

**I'm having issues with flashing the update, what can I do?**

Most likely you were using a non-stock kernel. Go here and flash the two stock kernels, then try again: http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/18hgkw/nexus_4_422_manual_update_instructions_stock/

1362590066.0	19s92i	"From iPhone 4S on Verizon to Nexus 4 on T-Mobile 
Switching and First Impressions"	goodguywin	80	16	45	"A not so brief description of my motivation and experience of my recent switch from iPhone 4S on Verizon to the Nexus 4 on t-mobile. Obviously, this is just my opinion. You may have your own. Post is kind of long so feel free to ctrl f to find what you are looking for or skip around the bold titles. If you have any questions, I will gladly answer to the best of my ability.

**Funding the Switch / Service Plan**

I sold my iPhone 4S which I bought a year ago and got enough money to buy a brand new Nexus 4. Say what you will about the iPhone, but I found it pretty impressive that it held its value that well especially since the iPhone 5 has been out for quite some time now.
Anyway, once I finish paying Verizon $220 for canceling my contract, I will be saving $50.00/month by switching to t-mobile’s $30/month prepaid plan (100 minutes talk time, unlimited data, and unlimited text, no contract obviously). This is huge savings since it leaves me the potential to save nearly $300 this year alone after paying Verizon the ETF. So far I have actually been very impressed with t-mobile’s service. Reception has not been a problem. Calls are clean sounding on both sides even while driving at high speeds. The data speeds are actually very satisfying at the HSPA+ speeds (Coming from 3G on the 4S). 

**First Impression**

The overall appearance of the phone is very minimalist which suits my taste well. The back however has that unique design that everyone has been talking about and I found that to be very attractive as well. The phone feels light as a feather on your hands despite the fact that the screen gives you significantly more real estate over the 4S.
As far as performance goes, you won’t be disappointed. Many reviewers have referred to it as a computer in your pocket and I completely agree with that description. Simply put, this phone is fast! Off course, with all of these Pros, something had to give; unfortunately it seems that the something ended up being the battery. It isn’t that it’s terrible, it’s OK. Maybe I’ve been enjoying it so much more and I’ve been using it more than I ever did my 4S. But in the end, I can hardly get through a day without having to charge it at some point. 

**Initial Motivation to Switch**

My first motivation to switch was due to the imprisonment my iPhone had me in (Especially combined with Verizon). I am generally not a fan of unlocking or jail breaking my phones since I use it for personal and professional use and I am slightly paranoid about security and ulterior motives those providing you with the software to accomplish this freedom may have. Additionally, I paid good money for this device and a data plan. I shouldn’t have to go through a process which could void my warranty and potentially leave me vulnerable to do things which the device is capable of doing but some corporate fat cat decided to gimp it because it wasn’t good for business. 
I could go on for a while on the specific restrictions that Apple and Verizon put their customers through (Most which can be solved through rooting) but that would get long so I am going to only list the two biggest things that really bothered me enough to make the switch.

1)	I was forced to use iTunes.

This was problematic since I use many devices (Desktop, Laptop, Tablet, Mobile) that I like to add/remove my music to/from. iTunes only allows you to add/remove music from one computer without having to completely wipe your phone before pairing it with another system. I also use Linux on one of my computers and iTunes is not available for Linux. The easiest way I found to have my iPhone talk to my Linux system was to virtualize Windows through Virtualbox, install iTunes there, then install some other lib files so that Virtualbox can properly communicate with the iPhone through a USB port. This wasn’t a very intuitive option. Still, this did not fix the problem of adding and removing music from various devices without having to first delete all of the music currently on the phone.

2) Stuck with Verizon.

Even if I stuck it out with my contract with Verizon until the end, I would still be stuck with them if I intend to keep using my iPhone. Despite the fact that the 4S is a dual band phone and can essentially work on any carrier around the world, Verizon has the phone locked so that I could never use it on any other network in the US. And even after I pay them all of my dues, they will only unlock it for international use.

Don’t get me wrong, the iPhone itself is a very good phone. For the most part it is reliable, user friendly and basic apps that your average person would use are already installed. But it isn’t very customizable out of the box as I mentioned above and it does not give you much freedom of choice if you purchased it through certain carriers.

**The Pros of the Nexus 4**

Google all the things! - Native Integration with all of ~~SkyNet’s~~ Google’s services is great! 

- Gmail, Calendar, Google Drive, Google Maps (I am a big fan).

- Google Voice - (Really handy with pre-paid services).

- Play Music - This solved all of my frustrations with syncing music through various devices. Not only can I plug-and-play drag-and-drop mp3’s into my Nexus 4 from any computer, I can also download/delete any of my mp3’s from Google’s Service to any of my devices over Wi-Fi. Now I can use any music player of my choice on my computers. I am free from iTunes.

Device Ownership - I own my device.

- When I go abroad, I don’t have to first call my carrier and ask them to please temporarily unlock my phone so that when I go to another country I can use a local service. 

- I can change carrier on a month to month basis (could even do day-to-day if you really wanted to with some carriers) to any other carrier in the US that supports GSM devices. 

- No bloat ware from my carrier - You know when that awkward moment when you have to explain to your mates that you can’t remove the Zappos app from your phone because Verizon won’t let you.

- Direct Download - All updates come directly from Google. Your carrier doesn’t get to filter out the things they don’t like.

A couple weeks ago I got a call from there repair center saying the box I sent in didn't have my Nexus 4, but two Verizon phones.  I said that those were not mine, and I definitely sent in a Nexus.  Mia, the customer service rep, said she'd look into it and get in touch with me.  After getting no call back, I called the number on the site.  I was emailed this [picture](http://imgur.com/pxr5LnL) to me!  Clearly not [this](http://imgur.com/ZYJljiq), which is what was sent. 

So while at work today I get another message from a rep to call them back before 7 pm to speak to a manager. I get home from work and call at 6:40 pm.  The rep I talk to conveniently puts me on hold till 7:00, tells me there's no manager to talk to, and I have to file a complaint with the postal service, since it must be there fault.

I ask if there's anyway to use the SN or any other information to identify the owners of the Verizon phones, since they probably have a repair request with LG and my phone might be found with that box. 

Nope! Since ""the get thousands of phones a day"" and I'm ""insisting"" I sent an Nexus 4, it's basically not their fault. According to the rep, it's more likely that an employee of the government was willing to risk their job, stole my broken phone, replaced it with two of their phones, and took the batteries out to comply with LG repair ... than it have been a mix up on their end.

So, unless something changes tomorrow when I talk to a manager, I might be out of a $400 phone.

But then there are some bad people too. And these people kept on deleting content from that spreadsheet.

So I then came up this with form-entry spreadsheet. Here the graphs are generated same as before. People will now enter their data via a form. That way no one will be able to delete all data and the devs will have easier time cleaning up the mess that the bad people will still enter :)

**Form entry link**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHhabEZuYjJIUEdwNFd0TkJrNmY1amc6MQ 

**Plot/Data sheet view** *(use the tabs at the bottom to switch between the views. You would probably be interested in the Plot view)*: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmM6lFxEl6RMdHhabEZuYjJIUEdwNFd0TkJrNmY1amc

NOTE:

(1) About the **reddit username** field in the Form: Please enter a valid username or a unique string that you can remember, so that you can update the shipping status when it changes from 'Still waiting.' to Shipped. For the purpose of getting the stats as accurate as possible, entries with blank or non-unique strings like lurker, N/A, none, nousername, etc will be deleted. 

(2) Change of shipping status is now handled. The reddit user who wants to change the status will need to make a new entry with the actual shipping date and the **exact same reddit user name he/she used the first time**. 

(3) Separate plots are generated for each country that has handful of entries (say 10+). 

*People interested in helping me out with this spreadsheet need to send me their Gmail address (PM/comments); I will give them edit rights.*

Thank you all who appreciate this effort and contributed to it!!

I've been waiting a while to spill the beans on this product that I've been testing for a Korean manufacturer since late last year. I've had a thread going over on the XDA forums about it, and have been beta testing the unit for the manufacturer since December.

I'm happy to say that the charger is at the final stage, and what they have is an amazing product for a wireless Qi Car Charger and Mount.

I give you, the Owl CarPad.

http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2029734


I know a lot of you aren't really hooked on the Qi wireless charging wagon, and it seems a bit frivolous if you aren't used to it, but what I can say is that this charger has made using my phone in my car a pleasure. Hop in the car, slide the phone into the mount and it's charging. That's it.

Anyway, enough of the sales pitch, I really just want to spread the word, as it's a really great product that has gone through enough testing to finally see a legitimate version that does what it says it does.

Coming from the testing side of things, I've seen it go from a charger that couldn't handle any usage and got too hot, to this final build where they have gotten the charging right.

I'm able to maintain a positive charge, while streaming Spotify over mobile data, BlueTooth too my car's head-unit, and also use Android's GPS Navigation, and the phone still receives enough charge to keep the battery usage positive to neutral.

If you have any questions, I'll be glad to answer them here, but be sure to check out that link above. All the most important info from the thread is located in the first post.

**Part 2 of the saga**

Things took a wild, wild turn last night.  It turns out the escalation team never did call me as promised.  I was pissed and felt like there was nothing I could possibly do to get this corrected in a timely manor!  I decided out of a little desperation to call Google Play Support back again and see if I could get anywhere with someone else.

Waited on hold for about 35 minutes after calling in around 12:15AM CST.  I kept hearing the announcement about how they were under heavy load.  It was fine, I was occupied with some work stuff I had to finish up.  I finally get a rep that was much, much more sympathetic and understanding about my situation.  We kind of connected and talked about other things while he was trying to find more information on how to help me and solve the issue.  He told me the other rep should have sent this straight to the escalation team and should have never filed for an RMA.

I don't want to give out any names or personal identifying information, so let's name our fantastic Google Play Support rep Victory.  Victory was an honest man and told me how the influx of new employees recently finished training and are unsure of the actions they take with complicated cases such as mine.  Well, sure, that's understandable.  As we started opening up a ticket (again) to get to the escalation team, I asked Victory if he could check the serial number of the Nexus 7 I have (CSSN) and if he could match it to someone else.

""Great idea, they might have your Nexus 4's!"", he explains.  That's just what I was thinking, but who better than the Google Play rep to give me this information than Victory himself.  So I give him this CSSN that's on the box of the Nexus 7 and lo and behold, he found out who should have gotten this very Nexus 7 in my hands.  And... he told me.  He fucking told me... I actually couldn't believe it.  

I wrote down the information (I recorded the call as well, I usually do this when I call customer service departments) and didn't know how to approach it.  It was 1:30AM by this time and I decided to go to bed.  Needed to rest up....

**Part 3 of the sage:  almost there..**

Woke up this morning, girlfriend made a fantastic breakfast (this is where you know my story is fake!  Reddit and girlfriend?  shit.), showered and got dressed for work.  Before I left, I checked out my computer and saw the information for the person who supposedly had my phones.  I contemplated for awhile calling as Google Play (illegal, yes, but I didn't do it) to follow up on their ticket to make sure it was the right person, but no, I didn't do it.  I said fuck it, I'll just ask for the person. Let's name this person Natalia.  Natalia answered the phone as the number I looked up online was her direct number apparantly.  I explained that this conversation was going to be a little weird and told her I believed I had her Nexus 7, and she has my Nexus 4.  She seemed very defensive at first, most likely trying to gauge what just happened.

I told her who I was, explained that I was semi-insane, and that we should meet and swap devices.  Just kidding - so as my story developed she felt more and more comfortable talking to me.  I told her what the serial number of the Nexus 7 was and she matched it on her packing slip.  I gave her the last 5 digits from my packing slip of each phone's IMEI, and they matched!  She initially wanted to go through Google Play and I'm happy that she's being a good citizen and will swap with me.

The swap will go down later tonight.  I say Google fucked up big time here, and one awesome rep that gave me information that he definitely should not have.  But, in the end, it all worked out.  And I don't have to deal with the worst support team in the entire world.

TL;DR Someone placed the correct packing slip and wrong devices, but right shipping label on my Google Play order.  I got the information of the person who received my Nexus 4's and after about a 15 minute phone conversation, we agreed to meet tonight to swap our devices.

**I have NOT done the swap yet.  It is now 1:15PM CST, this will take place later tonight!**

**Update 6:00PM CST**

Received an email from her:

*Google contacted me and after speaking with a supervisor, I have an issue with our exchange. I will phone you when I leave work.*

I sent this back:

*Just wanted to send you these pictures as more proof in case you had doubts about meeting me and exchanging.  Sorry about the sizes!*

*Just call me when you're free, I'll be in the office for another 15 minutes.*

And then received this:

*I have doubts due to the info they provided me.*

**What has Google done to my plan!?!**

**Edit 8:43PM CST**

What. The. Fuck.  Natalia called in to Google again and they advised her not to swap devices with me.  Google said her account was messed up and they told her she needed, in order to get credit back, send in the phones, and I need to send in the tablet.  They also told her that they disabled the tablet since she did not receive it.  I did not believe this bull shit until I read [Shipment lost or stollen](http://support.google.com/googleplay/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2661524) on Google's website.

So I will have 1 more than intended in about a week. Thus I'm willing to sell at cost to anyone in the Houston, TX area my additional Nexus 4. I know the fun and exciting thing to do would be cancel one of my orders but something tells me that if I tried this I'd end up with no phone and that is just not worth the risk. So hit me up with a PM and we can work out the details. I'm not looking for a bidding war or anything except straight cash or money order.

Cost for 1 was $336.58 - It will be in the original sealed packaging I receive from Google.

Edit - Seem to have a serious buyer in Houston and a backup from Austin.  Though until the sale has happened nothing is final of course.

**UPDATE** I received my shipment emails this morning stating they were shipped some time yesterday.  So still have a projected delivery date of tomorrow.

**UPDATE 2** My phones have been in transit from KY since 10:30pm on Friday, even though they were suppose to have shipped on Thursday.

1356598078.0	15ig0u	This subreddit has a real complex recently. The battery is NOT that bad unless you have another problem.	Riddla26	112	51	107	"[This is my Nexus 4.](http://imgur.com/a/DRIt0) Idle over 5 hours, it's drained about 6% of the battery. This is GREAT.

It utterly blows my Galaxy Nexus out of the water for battery life, I couldn't be happier with it. In the same period that would have easily eaten 25% or more. I run a completely stock unrooted device, with a full sync of my account, including active location services and history.

Every other thread in this subreddit is complaining about the battery life without performing any diagnostics, without even looking to see what's causing the drain. In any other support subreddit, especially /r/AndroidQuestions, you won't get any help unless you're at least willing to drop a couple of bucks on BetterBatteryStats so we can see which process thread is actually causing your battery to drain.

I don't know if the majority of you have the Nexus 4 as your first smartphone or what the case is, but there is seriously something wrong with you if you don't think this device provides great battery life. The most common misconception I see here is that ""Android OS"" is ""draining"" your battery.

The fact is that Android OS is a blanket term used in the battery list to show a unified amount of drain over time. I think someone in the dev team has left the reporting on for a component they shouldn't have, on pretty much every other Android the OS barely enters into the list unless there's some really heavy syncing going on, whereas now it's usually always in there but it basically ONLY shows the amount of idle drain which is next to nothing. I think they've left Android OS as a list entry tied to an internal component that's always used and that accounts for most of the idle drain of the device, this could be the radio or another main component.

People are just getting up in arms because of big percentages of small actual numbers. If you check it, there's barely any actual drain at all. Right now for example on my N4:

Android OS used 21% of battery - keep awake 59m  
Screen 14% - 26m on

Someone would say ""OMG THATS LOADS OF DRAIN!"" and indeed it does seem that way until you consider the following:

Time on battery: 9hr 35m  
Battery remaining: 75%

Then it just becomes amazingly impressive. 9hrs and only 25% battery used with half hour screen on? Sign me up for 8! It absolutely destroys my Galaxy Nexus on battery life and Android OS was hardly ever listed on there, which is exactly why I believe it's just REPORTING Android OS causing a drain, when really it's just reporting a stat that other phones don't.

I'm not saying this is the only problem, sure some of you might be experiencing some abnormal drain but the majority of people are complaining about battery life without even bothering to troubleshoot or even find out which app or service is causing the abnormal drain. 9 times out of 10 you can put it down to bad coding in an app not ending a service when it's supposed to. People here are blaming Google, blaming LG, never stopping for one second to consider it might be something *they're* running causing the problem. It's sickening and it makes us look like a bunch of entitled iFanboys rather than what the Android ecosystem has always been about - people tinkering and customising and ultimately - solving their own problems.

Tl;dr - This phone is amazing and every time I come here I just see people bitching about it without making any sort of attempt to rectify the problem which 9 times out of 10 isn't even down to the device. It's really making me want to unsub."	t5_2v9bv	True

Call (800) 243-0000 and get an RMA number, then mail your phone in. They will email you a PDF with a repair estimate and a form to send back with payment information once they receive your phone and inspect it. In most cases this is the same day. Instead of mailing or faxing the form back, call the above number again between 7am-7pm CST to speak with a supervisor and have your payment taken right there. They will make a hold for the amount quoted and then charge it fully once the phone is repaired.

However, I want to hear the bad. What do you not like? What do you absolutely hate? What needs improvement? What features are ""missing""?

Update1: Cons I already knew that people listed..... lack of LTE, lack of microSD, mediocre battery life. (I'll be using it on the Tmobile $30 prepaid plan so LTE doesn't even matter to me. Also as they launch their Advanced-LTE network later this year, only select phones will be compatible)

Update2: Cons I learned so far....... mediocre build quality, fragile/slippery glass, poor camera (esp low light), no OTG support, battery is not removable (thus no extended battery option), speaker location in the back causes it to sound muffled, device can get warm with heavy usage.

Update3: All in all, I don't care what others say, I'll be putting on a protective screen cover and a case on it. 

Update4: Headphone jack is on top (which is inconvenient) and headphone output through AUX is somewhat low volume (which leads me to believe that LG used a cheaper amplifier chip)

Update5: For those of you who think the output volume is low....JimboLodisC provided links to the external amplifiers you can look into.

So what did I do? I did the most logical thing to do when you're sold a faulty product (btw I bought it a month ago), I took it back to the store, more specifically Wind Mobile. ( I specifically went to the warranty centre).

I told them about my problem. They looked at it and seemed genuinely confused, and then the manager (or the person who I assume was in charge because he had that air of authority) said they had never seen anything like it before but unfortunately that he doesn't think the repair centre will fix it because of the ""physical damage"". 

He then suggested I try to contact LG and so I did, and they too said that they won't fix the phone because it is physical damage but what I fail to understand is how they can sell me a faulty product that broke by itself and refuse to fix it. 

On top of that it could've been a hazard to my health if I was holding it and that just randomly happened. 

The wind guy said I could try to send it to their warranty centre but they would need an $80 security deposit and if they decide that my phone can't be replaced/ isn't covered, they take $25 of that so I'm at a complete loss as to what do . 

That's why I'm coming to you /r/nexus4, has this happened to anyone else, does anybody know what the problem might have been and how should I go about doing to fix my phone?! HELP!

I'm not here to circlejerk about how much better Android is, really, but instead I have some questions. I know the title is questionable but I couldn't come up with a better one.

 The Nexus 4 is my first Android device, and I've had it for a couple of weeks now. Of course, I'd rate the phone 11/10 like everyone who has used it, but I want some pointers. What are some of the typical Android things I've missed?

I've jailbroken my iPhone since the first jailbreak came out for the 3GS, and could enjoy a lot of benefits from doing so; GameBoy emulators and such. I hear ""Rooting"" is pretty much the same, though I have no idea what this is and I hear people will get out of Google Wallet if they do this.

I guess what I'm trying to say is I want to learn about cool stuff that's unique to Android that every user should know, and play some GameBoy games. Unfortunately, I have ""lived in a cave"" for the last couple of years since this is my first Android device, so I don't know these things. Please share, and..

He checked on my order. Turns out it hasn't shipped yet, even though I got an email from Google Play Friday saying it had shipped.

[**Great News! You're package has shipped! Horray! HAAAJHAHAH! JUST KIDDING, SUCKER! IT'S STILL IN OUR WAREHOUSE 7 DAYS LATER!!**](http://i.imgur.com/zvIBL.png)

He said it was a ""logistical"" problem and he was escalating the case to get the item shipped. So he said best case scenario, I could expect it Friday. But I'm not holding my breath.

Keep in mind, I used the UPS My Choice tracking which told me to expect the package last night. Obviously, it never came. That expected shipping time was based on when Google created the label, not when the thing actually entered UPS's system. 

So if you're waiting for your device to arrive and the UPS tracking site still says ""A label has been created ..."" it's likely still sitting in a warehouse someplace waiting to be loaded onto a UPS trailer bound for your house.

Just thought you all should know.

Also Google... learn how to better launch/sell/release/ship products. This entire experience was awful.

* Charging:  From 14% to 98% in 2 hours 25 minutes (actually I think it was faster than this as it had gone into cycling mode).

* Power draw: .1 Amp at the outlet until it gets to about 95% when the draw drops to .05 to .06 amp.  power draw when the Nexus is not on the orb alternates between .01 Amp and 0.  Over the past 248 hours the Orb has drawn .2 kWh total.

* When not charging the Orb will use a one half second on and one half second off cycle to check to see if the Nexus is on the orb.  This cycling emits a weak EM field.  At two inches from the orb I can detect about 900 milligauss each time it cycles on and off.  At 4 inches the EM is effectively background.  (Prior readings were contaminated by my alarm clock.)

* Don't ask me to explain it but when the Nexus is on the Orb and it is charging there is almost no detectable EM field even if I put the Trifield right on top of the phone.

* Did another charge test.  Went from 24% to 60% in 1 hour which is consistent with prior result and is roughly 1/2 % of battery per minute.  That implies that to go from 0% to 100% would take about 200 minutes or 3.3 hours.  During this charge, battery temp went from 79 to 99 degrees F.

* Plan to check charge status when various metals are placed on the orb.

* Check power draw when Nex is on Orb AND also plugged into a USB charger."	t5_2v9bv	True
1362288751.0	19kayc	Why I'm returning my Charging Orb (a personal review)	Khyrdantai	68	14	101	"When I first heard of the charging orb, I was extremely excited to see a Qi charger that looked so good and would be nice to have instead of wearing out my Micro-USB port on my phone. Plus wireless charging is damn cool! Functionally, I thought I'd just place my phone on the charger and go to bed; it would just work.


Then I got it and that was the problem. It doesn't ""just work"". 


My impression of the charger was crushed by reality and because of it's design. It's a beautiful charger, but the slant isn't functional at all. Yes there's a rubber ring, but it can't have any dust on it at all or else the infamous slippery glass back of the phone would cause it to slide off the charger. (And if dust or finger-grease was on the back of the phone as well.)

I expected and hoped for a magnet in the charger, and it really should have.

Next issue was after it slid until the bottom of the phone touched the surface below the charger, it stops charging. So the phone has to be 'suspended' on the charger's rubber grip. I felt this was another design flaw.

Lastly, the phone has to be in the right spot or else it won't charge or it will fall off. 


So to use this charger I had to clean it and my phone before use, position it correctly on the charger, and hope for the best. Every time I tried to just lay the phone on the charger, it would have slipped off sometime at night. 

I feel like the Orb should have been flat instead of at an angle, or maybe a more slight angle. Using it was more of a pain in the ass than using a cable.



TL;DR: Pretty charger, but not functional. Easier to use a cord.

* **Screen** - Any light-bleed near the edges? Yellow tint or banding? Dead pixels?
* **Touch** - Any issues with touch responsiveness? Multi-touch vs single touch? Lag?
* **Battery** - Have you noticed any battery drains, from mediaserver or other such service? How long does your battery last? Do you get at least 15 hours of battery life? Full day use, more or less?
* **Cell Connectivity** - Any issues sending or receiving calls, texts or connecting to data? AT&amp;T or T-Mobile? Check APN.
* **Notification Light** - Does it work?
* **Camera** - Any lag? Focus issues? Strange noises? In video mode, does it autofocus properly?
* **Exterior** - Quality-contorl issues? Creaky frame? (thanks alekkk) Mushy or wobbly buttons?
* **WIFI** - Constant dropped connections? Difficulty connecting to networks?

I've been enjoying the ability to charge wirelessly, and keep it charging throughout the day. I recall reading that the batteries our phones use now actually suffer more damage if charged when there is very little battery left, so I haven't considered 'giving it a break'. 

I'm still on 4.2.2, on an old PA build. I don't have the time to check xda regularly these days so I tend to flash new builds after a few months. 

It *feels* like my battery life is shit now though. I used my phone for music, gps and navigation today for about an hour to two, with probably an hour of screen time answering emails and sending texts. I had to use the charger in my car to avoid running empty. 

I'm half wondering if it's just my battery stats being out of whack since I barely ever run my phone down below 70% for the last month or so.

1374879228.0	1j4mbv	Update - Left Nexus in a cab - RECOVERED! Some details of how cerberus got to working	NDL1988	68	18	15	"Disclaimer : Long read, poor grammar ahead. 

TLDR; get cerberus, but takes some time and only really works well in Wi-Fi. 

So 2 days ago I lef my cellphone in a cab and the driver took off.  Tried to track it using cereberus commands via their webpage or their text commands but it seemed it wasn't working. The person that had my phone had no intentions of giving it back, despite offering him a reward. 

The relevant part is: Cerberus gave me the location of the device yersteday night, via emial. The commands only worked from their web page and it managed to lock the screen as well. However, it never sent a confirmation  of these things woriking, and the text commands came out as plain text. It gave me a 30 meter radius of where my phone could be, I got lucky and found the car, asked around and one of his ''friends' told me the guy's name. 

I came back this morning with some company and yelled at his window and he evetually came down form his 3rd story studio flat (this was located in a not very nice part of town in Lima, Peru).

Finally he gave told me some bullshit about his ''friend'' selling him the device for 200 soles, (rougly $72) and told me he's short of money and couldn't just lose it. I told him that I could either report him to the police and he can keep a locked phone, or that he could give me the device and I'd give him half the money. He took the second option and now I hafe my N4 back. 

The reason I wanted to share this is beacause I learned a few things out of this. 

1) Cerberus works well, but only once the person connects to a Wi-Fi network, it will dispaly battery levels, IP number, and will give you an approximate adress. 

2) The service provider is not able to track an unlocked phone, such as the N4. 

3) They are also not allowed to disclose the thiefs adress w/o  an official police request

4) Doing some basic detective work will really increase your chances of recovering this, people will get scared once they're exposed. 

Finally I hope you never have to go throught this, but just in case, I recommend getting the Cerberus App and let it do its job, even though it will take some patience. "	t5_2v9bv	True

1370932166.0	1g3t8q	Why is Google Now so intuitive yet so utterly stupid?	the4ndy	74	30	56	"Allow me to explain. First by saying that I love what Google Now does, i understand its new and I can only assume it will get better from here. But that being said, here area few of my praises and a few more grievances.  
  
Lets say its 10:30 and im about to leave for work, i check Google Now, and it says ""12 minutes to work, 2 minutes longer than usual""...I think Great! But then I realize its not the way I go to work, oh well i take back roads. no biggie. But i cant change it. So i travel to and from work every day for months now and Google Now STILL thinks i take the highway to work, and always tells me driving times and traffic based on this route, it cant seem to learn. Also seemingly stupid, Google Now will tell me the time to work ALL THE TIME. Despite having an alarm in my phone labeled Work and despite me having an almost never changing work schedule, Google Now never seems to learn. And so I am constantly told how long it takes to get to work, even if its not for 12 hours from now, on a route i never take, ever.  
  
The *Researching* cards are nifty. And they keep my scatterbrained self interested and up to date on the things im working on. However, once again, Google Now cant learn. I will search extensively for NFL stats, news, highlights, fantasy football, etc and it never shows me anything related to the NFL, I looked up the score to an NBA playoff game for a friend once, WONT STOP showing me scores and schedules. On the card if you press the ""!"" you get a prompt at the bottom of the card that asks if you are in fact researching the topic at hand. Hitting yes or no highlights the option but there is no close or ok, and i fear my selections arent being submitted because Google Now will NEVER stop showing me research topics no matter how many times and different ways i select NO. It also doesnt show me the topics I do select YES for.  
  
Also as a side note, it would be nice if google partnered with a sports company and did some good with their sports stuff. If i Google search a sporting event i get a ncie spread of info and stats, box scores, player stats, etc. its like a mini score center. When i use google now I only get the score. and when i expand i still only get the score with a swipe like scedule browser, nothing more. Also when you program your favorite teams in the settings section of the sports card, you can ONLY search for teams, it would be nice to be able to ""like"" or select players, sports in general, cities, etc  
  
Whats the deal with **Show more cards**? is there an option to always just have all the cards come up? I wish I didnt have to hit that everytime, cause basically google Now is just a weather app until i hit that button, it doesnt ever show me anything but the weather until i hit show more cards, I wish it would always show me all my cards. and if there wasnt anything new put the card at the bottom and make it small or noticably empty of new content.  
  
I understand Google Now is meant to be very intuitive, and it is. I nearly came after i realized that you can reference the previous search in your new search terms (ie: what is google's stock price? What about microsofts?). I just wish I had the ability to help Google Now along so that it didnt flail helplessly sometimes. I understand its not a perfect system, and thats why i want to give it input to direct it on the correct path. Much like the ""Are you actually researching this"" option but one that actually takes into account how i answer, and actually benefits.  
  
Sorry for this rant, if anyone has any similar problems or has found any temp or even perm fixes to these problems or anything to share I would love to discuss.  
  
**TL;DR** Google Now isnt very good at learning and I wish i could help direct it more so that it gets better."	t5_2v9bv	True

Basically my nexus 4 gets into a state frequently whereby the mobile data simply will not work until I reboot the phone. I have heard people mention it happens when they are in wifi for a long time then leave it. I only see it when I am in wifi AND out of cell range for a while.

Details (post a comment if you have anything helpful to add to this list):

Phone:

Stock Nexus 4 black 8gb purchased from Google Play in March.
NOT rooted/modified in any way other than:
Nova launcher


Plan:
T-mo 100/unlimited $30 pre-paid

When it happens:
My house has zero t-mo service, just wifi. When I leave for work in the morning, I lose wifi for about 2 minutes before I hit the nearest cell tower. When I get in range of the tower, the icons continue exactly as they are when it is working (same number of bars and same e/h indicator in the same location) except everything is grey. When I get to work (right next to a second cell tower), everything is still grey until I connect to the work wifi. As soon as I connect to the work wifi, my mobile indicator turns blue, BUT does not indicate ""H"" which it does when ""working"" at work (as the cell tower is right there). If I subsequently turn off and on the wifi, the mobile data indicator will turn grey/blue in tandem (grey when wifi off, blue when wifi on).

Bluetooth is on and connects to my car as soon as I turn it on to leave (still in range of wifi, no cell).

Note that connecting to the wifi at work all day, then leaving, has NEVER caused this bad state, it is ONLY when I have been out of cell range for an extended period. This could indicate either that the ""time away"" has to be more like 14 hours (overnight) and 8 hours at work is not enough, or (most likely) that the issue is going from ""wifi/no cell"" to ""no wifi/no cell"" to ""no wifi/cell"".

I have tried toggling airplane mode, and each individual radio (wifi, bluetooth, mobile data), and the only thing that fixes it (and it fixes it every time) is rebooting the phone."	t5_2v9bv	True

Some got 3-5 days, some got 1-2 weeks. It appeared that the time you ordered played no part in determining your shipping estimate.

The 3-5 day window has come and gone, and nobody has received their Nexus 4 (except a few *4-5 weekers* who got their Nexus 4 instantly).

XDA-Developers user Smadger has created [this site](https://sites.google.com/site/nexus4cr/home) to collect as much information about the Nexus 4 UK relaunch as possible. It includes quotes from CSRs (which we have currently concluded as being a mess of misinformation, outright lies and confusion), clarification on Google's order and money-taking process, and has written a letter to the MD of Google UK, Dan Cobley.

[The Letter](https://sites.google.com/site/nexus4cr/the-letter) basically outlines the disappoint felt not by the Nexus 4 delays, but by the lack of communication and misinformation coming from Google. We have heard *nothing* about our orders. Dan Cobley has responded numerous times, both via email and [Google+](https://plus.google.com/113390679691036376988/posts/5GygopdUCSZ).

[His responses](https://sites.google.com/site/nexus4cr/responses).

I'm remaining hopeful that 'things are moving' now. Whether an official apology is made, or a full solution becomes available, just some recognition of the problem by someone other than a thrown-in-the-deep-end CSR is comforting to hear.

By popular request, I have enabled flair in this subreddit to aid users in displaying information about their Nexus 4.
I created some preset templates, but you are free to make your own.

Here is some information to consider including in your flair:

- Your phone's storage capacity

- Your carrier

- Your current ROM

- Your root status

I recommend *everybody* include at least their storage capacity, however it's not a requirement.

The only rules in place at the moment are that your flair **must** be related to your device, and it must be appropriate. 

Flair that violates the rules will be removed, and there will be a three-strike system.
After the third strike, your flair privileges will be revoked.

If you see anyone with flair that does not follow these rules, please send a message to the moderator inbox.

Here is an example of what your flair might look like:

[Inside-out](http://i.imgur.com/wBunOlT.jpg)

It was pretty cool. Basically you turned your photosphere into a tiny planet, but before you saved it, you could touch ""crop"" and rotate the picture 180°. Then, when you save it, it gives you the tunnel.  
Since I upgraded to 4.2.2, the crop button is greyed out until you save the picture, but then if you rotate the tiny planet, it just turns the planet, and doesn't turn it inside out. I don't know if it's enough of a reason not to upgrade to 4.2.2, but it's still a bummer."	t5_2v9bv	True

1360866802.0	18j1l1	Zens wireless charger preliminary review (spoiler alert: overhelmingly positive)	DrDerpberg	54	7	34	"Since Google hates Canada, I gave up on waiting for the orb and bought [this](http://ca.shopandroid.com/zens-wireless-single-charger/5A233A12862A.htm) Zens Wireless Single Charger online. Delivery was faster than expected (I ordered on Tuesday, it was supposed to arrive on Friday or Monday but arrived today), but I'm lucky enough to live a 45 minute drive from the origin point so I guess your results may vary. I guess it's worth noting that when I ordered, the ""expected"" back in stock date turned out to be accurate.

So far I love it. The main things I think may be of interest are:

* This is definitely legit Qi. I checked Zens out on the official Qi website. I was going to buy one of the Fasttech chargers but they seemed sketchy and I couldn't find any claim they were certified (""compatible"" might not be the same thing).

* The charging zone isn't too finnicky. I have to be careful putting the phone in place, but it's easy enough to line up and slide over a little bit until the LED pops on, at which point I'm good. You have to look at it (you can't just throw it on the charger), but I think that's the nature of Qi. I thought the screen was supposed to turn on and make a noise, but this is my first day on Paranoid Android and I may have missed something in the settings. At some point I'll put down some tape or something to help me line it up right every time, but as long as you take 2 seconds to line it up you shouldn't have problems.

* It works well with my relatively thick [Ionic Guardian case](http://www.amazon.ca/Ionic-GUARDIAN-Armor-Nexus-Black/dp/B00A06Z41E), and when charging the temperature stabilized around 29 degrees C. My home temperature is around 22-23C, and when idle the battery temperature is around 25-26. We'll see what happens during a full charge (I've only charged from 80% to 100% so far) or in summer, but for now I don't think I need to worry about the case trapping in a lot of heat. The charge from 80% to 100% was surprisingly quick. I can hold the phone (with case) a millimeter or two in the air above the charger and it'll still work, so I think there's even more leeway. I assume charge time and efficiency suffer with increasing distance, though like I said so far I'm pleased with my initial experience. **EDIT: I'm charging from low battery for the first time, and the battery actually stabilized at 38C. Quite a bit higher than before. Charge speed is shockingly fast though: 25% to 75% in just over an hour.**

* The LED is nice and subtle. It's bright enough that you can see it in daylight, but not so bright that it'll bother me in the dark. It's actually (very approximately) similar in brightness as the notification LED, just much bigger.

If anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to answer them, but I guess when a charger works there isn't usually much else to say about it. My initial impressions are that this is exactly what I wanted, I'm happy with the price, and that its completely flat surface mean it should easily be forward-compatible with just about any phone or tablet that comes out with Qi in the future.

EDIT: [This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb_GU6UOk9g) helped me make my decision. It compares the Energizer charger to this one and the one from Fasttech. My experience is that the charging zone is a little bit more finnicky than this guy demonstrates, which I assume is because of the case. either way it's not a problem."	t5_2v9bv	True

1355170938.0	14meet	[Order date: Nov. 13] I was just placed on backorder for a second time	NegativeMass	57	14	53	"I ordered on launch day, Nov. 13.  I never received a backorder email, but obviously was placed on backorder originally. For the last few weeks, I have called numerous times and the only thing Play Support tells me is my order is pending, and I'll receive an email when it ships. My case was forwarded to specialists maybe 10 times now, and I haven't heard a response from a single one.

I just called Play Support again (it's become a daily routine), and this time, apparently one of the specialists left a note on my account, however did not communicate with me directly, that the device is on backorder, and there is no ETA.

This is absolutely ridiculous, I may give up on this phone purely out of principle.  Clearly Google doesn't want to take my money and ship me a phone, but they have no problem shipping phones same day for some people who ordered last week. Fuck that.

**EDIT: I called to cancel my order, and they said they couldn't do it.** The window for canceling an order is one hour after the order is placed (so in my case, almost a month too late). My card will be charge when it ships, but they can't tell me when. I said I couldn't afford to not know when this charge will hit my account (could be tomorrow, could be 8 weeks). So I removed my card from wallet (wallet support said my card info is still tied to the order however, and I'll still be charged eventually), but I'm also going to delete my wallet account entirely.  I don't have an android phone currently so I don't use Google Wallet.  The reps said they don't know what will happen since they've never heard of anyone doing that. At this point, I'm over it, I've wasted too much time dealing with this mess, hopefully Google figures out how to properly launch a phone, and maybe I'll try to buy a Nexus next year.

**EDIT 2:** I was able to successfully cancel through the Play Store, despite Play support telling me it was impossible.  I'm going to try to forget about this whole thing and maybe look into buying one of these later on down the road. This would have been my first Android phone, which is why I was so excited/frustrated with this whole mess."	t5_2v9bv	True
1354785396.0	14dkfz	Ode to an overworked CSR...	Riddla26	57	18	13	"Hi /r/Nexus4,

UK 1-2 week shipping estimate-er here.

I know everyone is super psyched to get their phones and stuff but... People are really really hounding the Google CSRs. From another thread someone had one of the ""Ships in 1 - 2 weeks"" ordered on Nov 27th and called (from context presumably not for the first time) last night. Now Nov 27th to Dec 5th is barely a week. We really shouldn't be bugging these guys until the orders are dispatched late. We're just making more work for them when they're probably understaffed and overworked as it is and tired of looking at your damn shipping order on their system which isn't going to be any different than any of the other thousands of orders that are in the exact same state.

When there are updates, you get emails about updates. If the stock isn't going out for you it isn't going out for anyone in your batch. Bugging them isn't going to make it leave Taiwan any faster.

I think it's great that everyone is so keen to get hold of the N4 and I understand, I really do, but... guys... it's just a phone. I placed my order and was very anxious to do so. I was sat at the keyboard at 4:55pm mashing F5 until the 5:05:51 that I was able to confirm my order, but now I know it's a waiting game.

I worked in CS for a while and I really feel for those guys. I won't be calling at least until it's actually PAST the 2 week shipping estimate I got on the 4th Dec, if I haven't had any shipping confirmation by the 18th I'll call to see what's up, but I know that if anything does happen we'll probably get an email about it, so I'm just going to chill the fuck out until a shiny box lands in my lap.

You can't rush these things and you know what they say:

Good things come to those who wait.

I've had a similar script running for myself for a while but after requests from friends, I added front-end and made it publicly accessible. It'll actually remember to email you when the Nexus is back in stock (unlike a certain search engine company).

Also check out the ""Get notified by SMS"" link on the bottom for details on how to set up free notifications to your phone. Sorry I couldn't provide it natively... I'm afraid it might end up being too expensive.

Let me know if you have any suggestions or ideas!

1372649502.0	1hekr7	N4 Kernel Thread for July	nicotoy	46	9	45	"Just thought a break from all the help and troubleshooting threads would be a nice change of pace.

I've spent the last few weeks testing out various custom kernels trying to get the best battery life/performance ratio from just the kernel's default settings. I only adjust the color settings if even available.

So far, these are the ones I've tried:

* Motley kernel build 49 - Probably my favorite kernel. I get good battery life while having close-to-stock performance. If only Motley would come back to update it.
* Matr1x 9.5 - Nice performance and battery life as well, but there was quite a delay whenever I turned the screen on, which made me give it up. The recently released version 10 supposedly fixes this. Its preset PA colors are nice.
* Faux (6-22) - I heard a lot of good things about the kernel, and I've enjoyed faux's gamma and sound controls implemented by other kernels, but this kernel just didn't work for me. My phone never slept and just stayed at 10XX mhz. Maybe it just didn't play well with Trickster Mod.
* IntersectRaven (3.4.47) - I really liked the dev's no OC, no UV, no tweaking, just flash and forget philosophy. Sort of unremarkable when I tried it, which isn't a bad thing at all. Felt very much like stock.
* Franco r156 - Finally caved in to see what all the hype was about. I still got comparable battery performance to motley and matr1x, but I noticed a slight decrease in frame rate.
* Franco M3 - I didn't notice decreased frame rate like I did with r156. Still similar battery life but was a good experience overall. I'd try it again soon.

Right now I'm back on stock just so I can reset my baseline expectations again. After another charge cycle, I'll try Matr1x 10.

Anyway, these were all my anecdotal experiences with some kernels. Maybe you guys can share your experiences with the ones you've tried.

1367061272.0	1d7lzq	Some crazy woman literally kicked my N4 out of my hands yesterday..	XNtricity	58	17	22	"..And boy am I glad the phone wasn't naked.  

She apparently was just released from the hospital and was rather unstable, as she was muttering to people all along the sidewalk as she approached where I was. I was sitting on a concrete bench with nothing but concrete all around me. Phone fell from about 3-4 feet, landed on it's back and flipped to rest on it's screen.  

I have the official bumper, Spigen SGP Ultra Oleophobic screen protector, and Xtremeguard wet-apply back protector. One corner of the bumper has a nasty dent, and the back protector had a pocket of air visible at the point of impact.  

I'll admit I'll be the first to say I prefer using a phone with no protectors, cases, or bumpers. But I also know that the N4 is rather fragile (I thought the previous iPhone model proved glass backs to be a bad idea). So no matter how careful you are, how much you baby the device, or how ""sure"" you that you'll personally never drop it because you tell yourself that ""I'm careful""; there will always be that one contingency you didn't plan for that ends up in a spider-crack.  

So I suppose this thread is a ""thank-you"" to Google, Spigen SGP, and Xtremeguard for excellent protective products."	t5_2v9bv	True
1364853504.0	1bgmfu	Some of you requested, so here is how I built my Nexus orb car dock	ajsnoopy	51	11	7	"I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/1b2yo1/my_nexus_orb_magnetic_charging_car_dock_phone/) last week and few of you asked how I achieved this. 

Pre-requisite: Must have an Invisible Shield type protector on back of Nexus. You may have the bumper case on. Any other case if used on phone is risky to use with this arrangement.



**Important: Ran several tests, and found absolutely no effect on charging or discharging cycle times because of magnets. No adverse effects on phone. No GPS issues even in a tunnel.**

Sywpe for me has always had a bug with the shift button. The bug is where like 50% of the time when I want to capitalize something the letters on the keyboard do get capitalized, but the output of the keyboard isn't upper case.

The new bug that seems to have been introduced with Android 4.3 is a word deletion bug where I'm just swiping along typing and suddenly my cursor skips up a line and deletes a random word from earlier in the text. This bug doesn't happen nearly as often, but it's far more annoying than the other bug obviously.

Anyone with Sywpe experiencing this? I never had either of those bugs when it was in beta, but its speed and word recommendation have improved dramatically since it was released. Guess I've gotta take the good with the bad."	t5_2v9bv	True

* Bonus macro shot showing the dots on the back of the nexus which appear to be reflective lines, possibly laser cut.

Review:

* Bare nexus 4, fragile no protection.
* OEM Bumper, secure, great fit, great button feel, no protection for the back on anything other than flat surfaces.
* Pure Silicone Case, Great quality soft silicone, if I were a woman with a purse I would use this but since I am a man and my phone lives in my pocket it needs to slide in and out well, silicone is grippy. Fit is great, buttons are responsive, not quite as tactile but sufficient.
* TPU Silicone case, Junk, poor fit, do not buy.
* Ringke White case, Great fit, great protection, doesn't cover the buttons, matte surface slides in my pocket easily, decent grip on fingers.

Shown screen protector is extremeguard matte, I still haven't mastered application but it is tough and high quality."	t5_2v9bv	True

1361462680.0	18yjho	PSA: there is no warranty -at all- for the OEM bumper	rossenp	52	15	47	"So I've been fighting with both Google and LG regarding my crappy, broken bumper. By this point I don't really give a shit about the bumper itself, I just keep pushing because it really pisses me off that both companies just flat out refuse to stand behind their product. 

Background: bumper began to separate at the bottom near the microusb port (there are 2 parts glued together). This progressed, and it kept separating further and further; I guess this weakened it and it finally cracked, again near the port. 

I contacted Google first and they told me it has LG warranty and to go to them. They flat out refused to replace it. I tried about 3 times with them. 

I contacted LG 10 days ago and this was their ultimate response at the time (via chat): 

&gt;Okay, unfortunately this accessory does not show on the system, so I would need to contact upper management so they can put this on the system and this way we will be able to set up a Return Authorization for this unit. 8:28 AM	 Joe:	 I would like to contact you back on this via email, would that be okay, John?

I never received any email so I contacted them again today. Now it looks like this: 

&gt;9:35 AM	 Joe:	 As far as we know, the case is bundled by the carrier or channel it was purchased from. As for Google, Google agreed to handle this for their customers. We have checked as well for phones distributed through T-Mobile and seems that the customers should refer to them as well As far as out of warranty replacement, should be handled through the carriers as well 9:36 AM	 Joe:	 As an additional information, we have received information that there is nothing on this unit that will tend to break, as well if it is torn up, this would not be covered by the warranty as the warranty does not cover physical, cosmetic or liquid damage

and finally: 

&gt;... however we have already contacted upper management regarding this and the answer the gave us is that LG does not provide any warranty for this accessory, unfortunately .

is this bullshit or what? 

by the way, I have been emailing back and forth with Google and they have asked me for a serial number of my bumper. it is supposedly on the packaging, which I've long since thrown away. so i'm just curious is there REALLY a serial number for the bumper or what? 

TL;DR: LG/Google pass the ball to each other and customer is shafted with a crappy product. no recourse at all. "	t5_2v9bv	True

It's the only phone I can honestly say that can keep up with my fingers, swiping things away, opening apps, typing like a madman, I can't slow her down!

Edit:
I was on a galaxy s3, due to carrier issues, I needed a new phone, and here are a few comparisons:

-Screen:
The S3 definitely delivers nicer colors, but the whites and brightness on the N4 are beautiful, and the video playback I feel is nicer, probably due to that sexy ppi. Also, it's easier to handle the N4 since it's not so long, but the screen feels a little wider, not sure if it actually is or not.
-Controls:
I wasn't sure how I'd handle not having a menu button, but it's been fine so far, and I prefer the on-screen home and back controls, I don't have to worry about the button getting loose or recessing like I was constantly worried about on the S3
-Battery:
S3 wins this one, :/
-Storage
Not a problem honestly, since most stuff can be saved wirelessly now, dropbox, drive, etc...
-Stock Keyboard:
Love the N4 keyboard, not so much the Samsung keypad or their version of swype, but swype beta is still my baby
-Camera:
awesome on both honestly

For anyone considering it for business, know that the battery life isn't the greatest from what I've experienced and could be a problem if you need to always have the phone on, it's fantastic, don't get me wrong, and I want to defend the phone as much as the next guy, but I understand you need an honest usage/battery life ratio. I've gotten maybe 4 hours of heavy use vs 5 with the S3 but there's no getting around the non-removable battery, your gonna have to plug in.

1.) Any way to change the look of the messaging app? The iPhone had colors to separate who is who, and though it's obvious I quite enjoyed that. Any equivalents?

2.) The headphone volume is very low, I read a few times on here that it may be a hardware or software issues, thought or updates?

3.) Vibration seems a tad weak, I can't really feel when I receive a text. Any way to give it a kick? This is a dumb question I'm aware, but just wondering.

4.) Any way to put missed calls/texts on the lock screen? I saw my friend's Note had the ability to open straight to the phone/messaging app.

5.) Is visual voicemail a thing on Android? I tried using Google Voice but keep getting errors, is there some sort of recommended app that I can use as well?

Sometimes it just won't wake back up after the screen has been turned off.  Power button does nothing unless I hold it down until it reboots.  I even tried CM10 to see if that would fix the problem but it's still happening.

Any ideas/any others with the same problem?

EDIT: Wow, lots of comments overnight!  Some more details... It started happening a few weeks after I got it and would happen once every several days.  That was on stock, just unlocked and rooted.  It actually only seems to happen when the phone has been idle for a while.  Doesn't happen while using certain apps.

Then I tried the newest stable Cyanogenmod, 10.1.0 - figuring it was just a software bug and maybe CM would fix it.  It still seems to happen every couple days, however.

I haven't played around with clock settings, voltages, kernels, etc.

**EDIT 2: I called Google and they said since I've tried a factory reset and it didn't help they will do an advance replacement with a brand new phone (mine is about 2 months old).  No hassles or anything and the advance replacement is their default way of handling RMAs, including a return shipping label so I don't have to pay anything for the replacement.  Very pleased with Google right now.**

Some people blamed the card reader since stores rarely ever fix them if they break but I tested an RFID credit card on the same reader and it worked just fine. It was a problem on the phone then.

Literally a few of seconds of searching resulted in a reason: ISIS branded sim cards have NFC secure elements and cause a conflict with Google's own NFC secure element in the phone. This isn't the case on some other NFC equipped devices like the GS3 but seems to be an issue on the N4.

What is ISIS? It's a new payment scheme partnered with T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, and Verizon to enable NFC payments. If you have an NFC phone they'll have an app to use it, and if you don't you can use their NFC sim cards to make purchases. All you need to know is their sim cards cause problems for google wallet, and perhaps other features and isn't currently compatible with the N4.

How did you get a ISIS sim card? Probably when you got your micro-sim from your carrier you were in an ISIS test market and they gave you one without asking since the problem couldn't have been predicted.

My carrier, T-Mobile, was nice enough to replace the sim card, free of charge, to a non-ISIS sim after I called up support and told them the sim card was interfering with the NFC chip on my phone. I recommend going to an official store to make sure the replacement sim is not ISIS branded since employees are not yet aware of differences; you can chalk that up to the slow propagation of NFC tech until recently.

To tell ISIS and regular sims apart you would look for ISIS logos in the plastic cartridge from which the sim card is removed. In addition, there may be a difference in the pattern of the actual electronics of the sim. ~~[Left is the ISIS sim I had, right is regular sim.](http://i.imgur.com/fChsel.jpg)~~

I called them up yesterday, dropped by the store and a few minutes after that I was at a Duane Reade pulling up my key ring app, the wallet app, and finally making a purchase for the first time. 

**TL;DR: ISIS Sim cards are causing conflicts with the N4's NFC Chip. Call up T-Mobile, tell them your sim card is causing problems with your phone, request a new one, and go to a store to make sure you get a Non-ISIS Sim card.**"	t5_2v9bv	True

I received the most helpful information from danrant in this thread 

http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/15r9yv/using_kt_service_in_south_korea_drooling_over_the/  

and wanted to pass it on to everyone here in /r/nexus4.

This website had the best layout and info regarding APNs:  
http://www.unlockit.co.nz/mobilesettings/settings.php?id=277

My setting are as follows:  
Name: KT-HSDPA  
APN: alwayson-r6.ktfwing.com
Proxy:  
Port:  
Username:  
Password:

APN Protocol: IPV4  
APN Roaming: IPV4  
*You should seeAPN enable/disbale greyed out and enable*  
Bearer: Unspecified  

Now this is specific to S. Korea using KT (Korea Telecom). Also the only notable difference I found after entering countless different combination of info was that the default MCC was 450 and should be left that way and the default MNC of 05 should be changed to 08. Everything else should be left at default.  

I could have saved myself a lot of time and frustration if I just kept default and made as few changes as possible at first but I managed to get it to work in the end.  

If anyone has any questions specific to Nexus 4 &amp; Korea I will try my best to help although I just inputed information. All the leg work was done by Danrant and other within this forum.

1356304362.0	15cgik	For those having wakelock (or poor battery life) issues on their Nexus 4	tekjak	50	14	12	"After trying out [BetterBatteryStats](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asksven.betterbatterystats) on my N4, I've noticed that my phone is in constant wakelock, never going into deep sleep. After a bit of Googling, I've discovered it's due to a live wallpaper that I found in a submission here on r/nexus4 about live wallpapers a while back. It's the [Snowfall Free Live Wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fishnoodle.snowfall_free) from Kittehface Software.

Replacing it with another wallpaper (in this case, the [Lonely Tree](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brokenteapot.lonelytree.full) live wallpaper made by a redditor) corrected the problem, and now my N4 sleeps like it's supposed to.

Well, as I slid this box-spring on a slowly declining angle, I had to continuously lean forward over the balcony to keep a grip. The N4 dropped out of my pocket and into the yard. I did a little girl scream in my head and my heart stopped once I realized what had happened. When I retrieved it, there was absolutely no damage and nothing wrong with it!

I call Google who tell me LG deal with repairs. LG use a company called Regenersis. They send me some documentation a couple of days after I call then (LG) and I send it off. 

LG said it would take around two weeks. They usually inspect the phone then send you a quote for repairs after a couple of days. After one week I rang LG and they said just to wait. After two weeks I rang again. They rang Regenesis who said they didn't have the phone. After digging around to find my tracking number I proved to the that it was delivered. They said they would send me the quote as fast as possible (Monday). I then get a letter in the mail with instructions and packaging on how to send them my phone (Wednesday). I don't know why they sent me this after having the phone for over 2 weeks. It's now Friday and I have been told every day that I will get a quote on the repair the next day. I sent them the phone 3 weeks ago and they haven't even looked at it yet.  So far I have called Regenetsis and LG about 10 times. 

I'll report back on the repair quality and cost once its done but if you break yours it may be better to go to another repair company. 

EDIT: They have said it will cost £120 and take 7-10 days. For some reason they won't let me pay till Monday because a supervisor is away. That's right no one can pay for any repairs today. Total wait time will be 6 weeks. Not worth it. "	t5_2v9bv	True

But now I'm starting to wonder where it gets its information.  I know it pulls things from internet search history, gmail, app and music history, calendar, etc.  But how do you explain this?

I'm leaving tomorrow to go on a vacation with my family in New Jersey.  This morning, Google Now pulled up weather in Newark, NJ (the airport) and a card with my flight info on it.  Which is cool, but...It's with my family, so I didn't do any of the work in setting it up.  I didn't buy the plane tickets, I didn't google anything related to New Jersey.  The trip is on my calendar, but the location isn't set and the date is about two weeks later than the trip is actually happening (we rescheduled and I never changed it).  So:

* Nothing in my search history about this trip
* Nothing in my Gmail inbox, archived, deleted, or anywhere else about this trip
* Nothing (relevant) in my calendar about this
* No credit card payments (through Google Wallet or otherwise) related to this trip
* A couple text messages, but nothing mentioning which airport I'm were flying into, much less which specific flight I'm on

Basically, as far as I'm concerned, my online footprint regarding this trip is essentially zero.  So how did Google Now know that I was going to New Jersey tomorrow, and how the crap did it know which flight I was on?

EDIT: Found a flight confirmation forwarded to me in my deleted folder.  No I feel a bit stupid haha.  It'd be a cool feature if Google Now picked that up and, along with giving me a Now card, put the event on my calendar for me.  Just a thought."	t5_2v9bv	True

**DESIGN**

I'm a big fan of the way these headphones were designed. The fettuccini - like cord helps prevent tangling when you throw the headphones in your pocket. The headphone jack is an L shape, which can help your headphones cord navigate through your pocket easier. The tips of the headphones had a double layer, (see the album) this is great for noise cancellation, and that cancellation works well! If you're not a fan of noise cancellation, don't worry, because these headphones come with other optional tips. Many people are saying that these are the exact same headphones that come with the LG optimus G, but that's not true. They have the Nexus logo on the back of the head of the headphones, and come in a different packaging. Everything else, though, could  potentially be the same. This headset also features a play/pause button (which can also access Google Now if held down) and a microphone, located under the left headphone. These headphones have a premium look, but they don't feel as premium. 

9.7

**SOUND**

The sound is average, above average compared to Apple's Earpods, and the stock headphones that come with the Samsung Galaxy SIII. Don't expect anything fancy! The bass isn't great, but it isn't bad either (this also depends on the noise level you have it set on.) On that note, these headphones sound really loud, this may be thanks to the help of the noise cancelling tips. Overall, these headphones produce a clean sound, so there's no need to expect anything tinny or quiet!

8.2

**MICROPHONE** 

The microphone isn't so great. I have tested it multiple times using the audio recording section on Google Keep, I sound a bit muffled, but it doesn't pick up background noise. The muffled sound could be due to me mumbling, though.

5.9

**OVERALL RATING**

A solid 8.0. I would definately recommend this headset to a friend, because they are a quality headset for the price. I would expect the same quality sound from a $50 headset. Thanks for reading, if you have any other questions, ask in the comments or PM me!"	t5_2v9bv	True

I wrapped this magnet configuration in one layer of black Duck brand Duct Tape, and stuck one Scotch indoor mounting square to the back.

Here is a photo of the [**sticky stuff**](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0lqdawqVmM9aGdzVmdsZHNsbHc/edit) used.

Here is a photo of the [**final product**](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0lqdawqVmM9UGRGQlBMM3k2ZlU/edit) on the car dash.

I don't have another camera (with charged batteries) besides my phone, so I can't take a photo of it mounted up there, but it mounts nicely in the same place my Gnex used to be.

To test this, [which at first was scary because I don't have a bumper :( ] I drove over the speed bumps in a few parking lots and found a dirt parking lot and spun doughnuts for a few minutes.  The phone didn't move at all.

Something to consider when deciding if this method is right for you is that I use the ExtremeGuard screen protector for the rear side glass on my phone.  I find that it is slightly stickier than the glass, and I feel safer holding it.  In addition, the slight rubbery feeling granted by the screen protector acts to help anchor the phone against the Duct Taped magnets on the dash.

If I didn't add enough photos, let me know.  I will take some more.

BEFORE I TELL HIM ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, he pretended to type something in his computer and then told me: ""your order looks OK"". Intrigued about how could him magically know what was my order (I was not even calling from my cellphone), I asked: ""can you please confirm my email?"". Coincidently the phone call dropped.

I can't see nothing more disrespectful from Google than that. For those who are defending this awful support, think twice now."	t5_2v9bv	True

I signed up for the pre-release promotion for the HTC One a few months ago and this morning i received an email that its available for pre-order from HTC for $575 (32gb). With the coupon from the earlier signup i can get $100 off, so $475 all-in.

Pluses; thats one gorgeous phone. Also 1080p, better camera maybe?, etc.

Minuses; no stock android so who knows when you'll get new updates. Blinkfeed is a nuisance and cant be turned off. 

Or get the N4 for $375 at the play store. But its 5 months old now. :(

Decisions, decisions....

Maybe wait a month and hope for a 32gb N4 or N5 at google i/o? (highly unlikely)

1354825413.0	14egqa	Nexus 4 VS Galaxy Nexus, a purely subjective review	DarthKhan	55	22	46	"Pros:

* The external speaker is a lot louder than the GN. I usually listen to songs when I take a shower, the phone is placed about 3 feet away on the sink counter. With the nexus 4 I can actually decipher the lyrics of my favourite kpop songs; with the GN I had to really pay attention to hear the song. 

* Phone feels much better in the hand VS the GN

* I have LTE enabled with Fido in Canada (uses rogers network), dear god do web pages load faster with 4g compared to 3g in the GN. Although this might be attributed to the faster hardware of the nexus 4 as well. 

* Battery life with 4g use seems to be a bit better than the Galaxy Nexus. 

In the Middle:

* White levels and overall colours are much better on the N4 compared to the GN, but the black levels are worse. Overall trading whites for blacks can be seen as awesome or meh.  


Cons:

* Chrome doesn't seem to be as smooth as the stock android browser in the GN

* The lowest brightness on the nexus 4 is a lot higher than that  of the galaxy nexus. As a result when I watch porn in my bed at night with the lights off, my eyes get a little strained due to the high brightness.

1361063136.0	18o10f	Got my Rearth Ringke Fusion case today; my thoughts...	thevoiceless	37	2	41	"**The good:**

First and foremost, this thing is sexy, definitely the best looking case I've seen so far (I've tried out the Ringke Fusion, Poetic Borderline bumper, and Poetic Palette). I'm using it with a dbrand skin with no issues, and it looks awesome with the black carbon. It feels super sturdy, too; it looks and feels like it could take a beating. It adds a millimeter or two of thickness all around, but the case is shaped exactly like the phone so it's not too noticeable. The black sides of the case are just flexible enough to slide the phone in while still fitting perfectly. All of the ports/holes have plenty of space, including the headphone jack.

**The not so good:**

It doesn't have much grip, at least compared to the naked phone. I wouldn't go as far as calling it slippery, but it's enough for me to consider not using the case. The sides are matte and it feels like I can push into them with my nail, but when holding it regularly the material doesn't feel soft like rubber or TPU. There's also no physical feedback when pushing the buttons. Without the case, all of my buttons click; with the case, I can't feel anything.

Overall, I don't know if I'm going to keep using it. The grip is th biggest problem for me; I really want a case covered in the same material they used on the sides of the phone. I feel like a case shouldn't make it more likely to drop the phone.

1368779031.0	1ei9sw	Review: $32 eBay Wireless Qi Charger	crundy	39	6	34	"I recently stumbled across a cheap Qi charger on eBay ([link](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Wireless-Qi-Power-Charger-Pad-Receiver-for-Lumia-920-I9300-Note-II-LG-Nexus-4-/400460762726?ssPageName=ADME:L:OC:GB:3160)) and thought for the price I should give it a go. Delivery to the UK was free, so in total it cost about £20 and took ten days to arrive. I got it yesterday and have been playing around with it, as well as using it to charge my phone overnight on my bedside table, so I thought I'd do a mini review here in case anyone else is interested.

The design is [as you'd expect](http://i.imgur.com/eEiOfhw.jpg), nothing too fancy but it does feel pretty solid. The [plug](http://i.imgur.com/yKvuhnq.jpg) is US style, but it came with an adapter to EU style (although not UK, so I had to fish out one of my old adapters). The input looks pretty standard so I'm sure you can find a replacement power cable if needs be.

[Charging](http://i.imgur.com/hVAlp6l.jpg) the Nexus 4 works perfectly. It doesn't seem to be too fussy about where I put the phone, but from the location of the coils I'm guessing it works best with the top of the phone just slightly poking out over the top of the charger. The status LED on the device is green when not charging, and turns blue when the phone is placed on top. When the phone is fully charged the LED will go green again, and then alternate back and forth as the phone switches the charging on and off. The LED isn't especially bright, so it shouldn't keep you awake at night. If you do have a problem then I guess you could stick a bit of masking tape over it, or open up the charger and colour one side of the LED cover with a black marker. People always talk about their phones getting hot when using wireless charging, but I've only noticed my phone getting a bit warm on the charger, certainly not as hot as when I've been doing something intensive on the phone like gaming.

As with most Qi chargers, it has a ""beeper"" inside which beeps relatively quietly when the phone is first placed on the charger. Unfortunately this also means it beeps every few minutes if you leave the phone on the charger for extended periods, leaving me to wonder why manufacturers put a buzzer in the charger at all. The phone already beeps once when charging first starts (unlike the charger, it doesn't beep every time charging restarts) and there is a status LED on the charger and so a buzzer seems completely unessessary.

Fortunately this is really easy to fix. Just pop off the 4 sticky feet on the back of the charger and unscrew the 4 exposed screws. [Open the charger up](http://i.imgur.com/H5FuQfZh.jpg) (watch out for the LED cover, it falls out easily) and [locate the buzzer](http://i.imgur.com/tSoS1syh.jpg), which looks like a little black box with an arrow on the top and a slit in the side. Insert a small flat screwdriver in the slit and twist to pop the lid of the box off. Then you can just remove the [metal disc](http://i.imgur.com/AQ59fp3.jpg), press the lid back on, and reassemble the unit. Hey presto, no more beeping!

One oddity I did notice yesterday which I haven't been able to replicate today is that sometimes when I placed my N4 on the charger, there was what appeared to be a series of random screen taps, which caused apps to open, or wrong unlock codes entered (depending on whether the phone was locked or not). I can only imagine this was a blip with the phone rather than the charger, but I'd be interested to know if anyone else has this problem with a Qi charger?

So anyway, I'm chuffed to bits with this charger. It cost almost half the price of other Qi chargers out there, it works perfectly, and disabling the buzzer was incredibly easy. I think I may have to get another one for my office.

1360247087.0	182ctj	Good Guy Poetic: contacted me out of the blue and told me they would replace my bumper and ship it to me for free—and I live in Europe!	Wondersnite	42	11	13	"Last month, I bought a Poetic bumper case and had a friend bring it over from the US to Portugal, where I live. The bumper case is great, but unfortunately it started peeling away into two separate pieces after a few days. Since I live across the Atlantic and shipping costs would be more than what I paid for the bumper (only $10), and since the bumper case was still useable, I decided to just stick with it.

However, two days ago I got an email from Poetic (here: http://i.imgur.com/MqjTJU1.png) saying that their initial batch of bumpers was faulty and that they were replacing them free of charge. I was pretty excited, but since I'm living in a whole other continent, I thought that there was no way I was entitled to a replacement. I replied anyway, and they answered back saying that they'd have no problem in shipping the case over for free!

**TL;DR** Besides making a great bumper case, Poetic also has the best costumer service in the world and went out of their way to send me a new bumper, even despite losing money on shipping. These guys are awesome.

1374281789.0	1io3g5	A warning to anyone who has to go through LG to get their phone repaired.	NudistBuddhist	39	11	23	"This'll probably get buried, but it could end up saving somebody some hassle in the future, and honestly it feels pretty good to vent about my experience getting the screen of my Nexus 4 fixed. To sum it up, it was the single worst customer service experience I've had to deal with. Here's an outline of my time dealing with LG.

**Monday June 17** - My Nexus 4 somehow slid off of my bathroom counter and hit the tile floor, cracking the screen and disabling the touchscreen capabilities of the phone. I called LG and set up to have them fix it.

**Tuesday June 18** - I shipped my phone to LG as directed and chose overnight shipping as I needed the phone back before my vacation which started on July 5.

**Thursday June 20** - I checked the tracking of my shipment because I hadn't heard back from LG yet. I noticed that delivery was attempted the day before, but nobody was there to receive it, so I essentially wasted money on the overnight shipping.

**Monday June 24** - I got a call from LG saying that it would be $153 to repair the screen (as I expected), and they took my payment over the phone. The girl had to enter my payment information twice due to an issue with her computer, but assured me that I wouldn't be charged twice. I was given a time frame of 3-5 business days to inspect and repair and 2-4 business days to ship.

**Wednesday June 26** - I noticed that my bank account was showing two payments to LG, both for $153. I called them and they told me that one was a pre-authorization charge and would be dropped once the phone repairs were complete. I asked them if there is any way for them to drop it sooner because it was restricting the funds on my bank account to the point where I only had about $30 (my bank said they could fax a release of authorization), but they refused, after being on the phone with them for about an hour and a half that night.

**Thursday June 27** - I called LG and asked about the status of my phone. I was told that repairs were complete and that it would be shipping out by the end of the day. Also, my bank account still showed two charges at this point.

**Saturday June 29** - I noticed that I had a voicemail from Friday night about 5:15 pm. It was a girl from LG saying that my payment was declined and that I needed to call them Monday to re-process the payment so that my phone could get shipped back to me. I checked my bank account online and it still showed both payments, but one of them had posted to my account.

**Monday July 1** - By Monday morning the second charge finally had gone away, but the one charge was posted to my account. I called and explained this to a supervisor, and he had me email him a copy of my online bank statement to verify that I had indeed paid for the repair. This was after speaking with a regular customer service agent who wouldn't transfer me to a supervisor and even hung up on me.

**Tuesday July 2** - I called again to check the status of my phone, and another supervisor told me that she verified that I had made the payment and that my phone would ship out by the end of the week. I had to change the shipping address because I was flying out on the July 5.

**Friday July 5** - I called in the morning to get the status of my phone, and was told that it would be shipping out by noon and I could call in the afternoon to get a tracking number. I called in the afternoon from the airport and was told that my phone was still being repaired. I was absolutely livid at this point (as if I wasn't already). I was told that it would be looked into and I would just need to wait until Monday to call.

**Monday July 8** - I called yet again to ascertain what was going on with my phone, and they still didn't know what its status was, but were working to figure out what was going on. By now, I was pretty much desensitized to the anger that I had previously been feeling.

**Wednesday July 10** - I got a notification with my tracking number and it was to arrive on July 11, but I wouldn't be back until Friday afternoon (I was visiting friends at my university) and my Mom and sister were both working, so nobody would be there to receive it.

**Saturday July 13** - I finally get the phone back from FedEx and am quite relieved. However, and here's the kicker, I open up the box and the paper inside says that it's a refurbished model. That bothered me for a couple reasons. One, my phone was rooted and I had backed up my phone with Clockwork Recovery Mod after it broke, so I was expecting to be able to just restore it. I couldn't do that, and had some mobile authenticators installed that I have yet to get taken care of. Two, if they had sent me a refurbished phone from the beginning, I wouldn't have had to wait almost four weeks to get the damn thing back. They clearly lost my phone somewhere along the process and just decided to give me a refurbished one (which could have its own slew of issues).

Like I said earlier, after dealing with all of this, I was pretty much desensitized to feeling any kind of anger anymore, but it left me feeling very sour towards LG. I had always been a big fan of LG. I've bought TVs, computer monitors, computer parts, and more, and even recommended their products when I used to work retail. But they not only cost me time (I probably spent a good five or six hours total speaking with customer service), but money. I paid for overnight shipping that was wasted, had to get a burner phone and pay for minutes on that, not to mention that my monthly plan with T-Mobile pretty much went to waste. And through all of this, LG refused to expedite my shipping or compensate me in any way despite everything and was not helpful, to say the least. After all of this, I've decided to never give LG my business again. I've been a supporter of them in the past, but the service that was provided to me was abysmal, and their customer service came of as incredibly incompetent. 

I'm not suggesting that everybody will have the same experience as me, but I certainly don't have any faith in LG's ability to handle things in a timely manner. So if your Nexus 4 ever breaks and you're thinking of sending it to LG for repairs, I'd highly recommend against it. You're likely better off finding a third party to repair it.

**TL;DR - My Nexus 4's screen cracked and LG mishandled the shit out of the repair process. They clearly even lost it at some point and just sent me a refurbished phone. All in all, I was without my Nexus 4 for about four weeks, and LG has lost my business forever.**"	t5_2v9bv	True

Ditch the soft keys and control everything with gestures. 	thugrat	37	6	41	"This started with [simple home screen gestures using Nova Launcher and Tasker](http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/14dr11/how_to_use_nova_launcher_gestures_to_give_you/), and now it is a system wide gesture setup based on [GMD Gesture Control](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.goodmooddroid.gesturecontroldemo) and [Fullscreen Toggle](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1497558)

You will need root and the full version of GMD. 

Install the two apps linked above. Spend some time playing with GMD and getting the feel for custom gestures. Here is how I have mine setup:

* Back - Swipe right to left from the upper right (very natural) (default gesture)
* Home - swipe up from the bottom center (where the home button used to be!)
* Recent apps - swipe up from the button right (use the 1/3 bottom, not bottom right corner) (where the recent apps button was)
* Menu - swipe right to left from bottom right corner (this time use bottom 1/3 of right side)
* Screen off - three fingers touching anywhere on the screen
* Media play/pause - two finger tap anywhere on screen
* Media next - two fingers moving right, anywhere on screen
* Media prev - two fingers moving left, anywhere on screen
* Alt tab - one finger starting in the center 1/3 of right side of screen. Move up and left. 
* Next app - one finger starting from right 1/3 of bottom edge, moving up and to the right.
* Previous app - one finger starting from right 1/3 of bottom edge, moving up and to the rleft

**NOTE: For some reason, GMD's 'back' gesture doesn't work right inside GMD itself. It will back you all the way out of the app. You have been warned.**

Open fullscreen toggle and tell it to disable your bottom bar. It will probably soft reboot your device. Then open the app again, tell it to disable, and this time manually do a full reboot. Your nav buttons are now disabled. Enjoy your new found screen space. 

For a bit of extra space, most aftermarket launchers allow you to hide the status bar. I have this set in Nova and I use the Nova 'swipe down' gesture to open notifications.

I haven't even started trying to integrate Tasker with this, but it is possible as you can assign a Tasker task to a gesture using the shortcut -&gt; task cut option. Enjoy and post any gestures that you use, please!"	t5_2v9bv	True

Plus, I did a bit of calculation... GrooVe IP claims to use 1.2MB/min while talking. That means just over 800 minutes per 1GB of data used by VoIP! If only AT&amp;T would give me tablet plans for my Nexus 4... I may have to look into a Verizon mobile hotspot!"	t5_2v9bv	True

1373941466.0	1idvc2	Google's RMA technical support is a nightmare.	Vliger2002	44	17	30	"This is just my experience, thus far. You may have had a very positive experience with Google's technical support team, but I, for one, have not.  

**Problem:**

It all started with the fact that my Nexus 4 (Black, 16GB) has run into severe Wi-Fi issues. I cannot see/connect to 5GHz wireless networks, any longer. I used to be able to just fine, though. This happened within the first 4 months of owning my Nexus 4. It was on stock room, unrooted, when this issue occurred. I was using it lightly (not for gaming or anything), and I never dropped my device (I also have a solid, protective case).

**Troubleshooting:**  

* Toggling the Wi-Fi on and off
* Switch the Wi-Fi frequency band to 5GHz on the device
* Rebooting the device and the router
* Updating the router firmware
* Changing the 5GHz channel on the router 
* Factory Reset
* Custom ROM

**How I knew it was a faulty device:**  

My sister recently got a White Nexus 4 (White, 16GB), and it ran perfectly fine on the 5GHz band. So did my MacBook Pro, my desktop computer, a Galaxy S4, and all 6 of the iPads in the house.  
  
**The Google RMA Experience:**  

*CALL 1:*  

I decided to take care of this issue by contacting Google. I do have a SquareTrade warranty, but this issue is covered by Google, so they had me RMA through Google. So I contact Google on Saturday (7/13/13), and I talked to Erin over the phone about my problem. He agreed that it was faulty, and definitely needed a replacement (I told him about my sister's N4, as well). He told me that would get a follow-up E-mail within the next couple minutes, and would also receive my replacement order form by Sunday (within 24 hours).

I got the follow up E-mail pretty shortly, and he spelled my name wrong. It's spelled ""Dylan"" not ""Dillan,"" but I dismissed that. But it was a short, generic e-mail that didn't require a reply.

Sunday morning rolls around, and still no replacement order form. I check throughout the day, and still no e-mail. So I decide, ""Alright, I'll try Monday, I know they've got to be working on weekdays."" So I sent Erin a message at 12:46PM today (7/15/13) asking about my replacement order form, and also putting the correct spelling of my name. He replied at 6:23PM, stating that a specialist replied, asking for my modem make and model.  

First off, when I first talked to Erin, he asked me over the phone if I wanted to transfer the call to a specialist to try and troubleshoot my Wi-Fi issue. I said I didn't, and that I knew my device was faulty because I have a second N4 that works perfectly. Secondly, you don't need to know the make and model of my **modem**. Erin, what you and your specialist were looking for was the make and model of my Wi-Fi **router**. Two very different things. Lastly, he ignored the correction of my name, and referred to me as ""Dillan"" two times. They sure know how to make the customer feel important!

*CALL 2:*  

So instead of replying to the E-mail and getting a response on Tuesday, I decided to call Google tech support again. I got connected to Kim, who actually asked how I spell my name. I asked her about my RMA, and how I didn't receive a replacement order form. I also told her how Erin asked about my *modem* and not my *router*. She assured me that they didn't need my *modem* information, but they did need my *router* information for the RMA form. I gave her the information, and she processed it right there. I got a follow-up e-mail with the appropriate RMA sheet, shipping label and the link to order my replacement device.  

However, when I clicked on the link to order my replacement device, it was for a **White** Nexus 4 16GB. That's not right. My sister has the White N4. I have no idea if they set up an RMA for the wrong device, or if they just decided that they would replace my Black N4 with a White N4. I do not want a White N4.  

*CALL 3:*  

So yes, I call in AGAIN (literally 6 minutes after I got the e-mail), and I get connected to Cole. I tell him how I'm supposed to have a Black replacement N4, not a White N4. He tells me he'll forward my case to a specialist (seriously? Kim didn't need a specialist, although she did mess up my order). We hang up, and he sends me a follow-up e-mail titled:  

*""Customer is calling in today because he received an RMA form for his white Nexus 4 but its his black nexus 4 thats having the wifi issues""*  

He misunderstood. I said I got the order form for a White replacement, but the RMA is for my Black N4. For all I know, the RMA *is* for my Black N4, but they accidentally gave me a link to order a White N4 instead of a Black N4. I e-mailed him back, letting him know, and he forwarded the info to the specialist.

None of these Google Tech support representatives bothered to confirm the issue with me at the end of the call. They didn't make sure that *they* understood what I needed. I wasn't asked, ""So your RMA is for your Black N4, right? And you want to replace it with a Black N4, correct?""  

This is probably the worse customer support I've had to deal with from a company with such a huge reputation. This is **Google** we're talking about. I'd expect that their employees knew what they were talking about and had a very strict protocol so that they could ensure the issue would be handled 9/10 times on the FIRST call. This is disappointing. I love Google, but seriously, this is a nightmare."	t5_2v9bv	True

Ever since then, I've been looking for cool things to do with my phone. I'm getting a raspberry pi set up so I can connect to an IRC bouncer, so even if I'm not connected to wifi or 3g, I can still stay online. But that's about the extent of cool things I've done, and admittedly, these things aren't very cool. So now I'm looking for ideas from the community.

1372313973.0	1h5wjr	for those that use LTE on their N4	not-brodie	33	5	90	"tl:dr you only have to edit the lteOnCdmaDevice line. 

i recently found out that tmo launched LTE in my area without publishing anything about it. in my quest to make the changes stick after reboot, i checked a bunch of different guides, but they all required a factory reset. and the changes wouldn't stick between ROM flashes. lame.

through trial and error, i found that you only have to edit the build.prop ""lteOnCdmaDevice"" line to read lteOnGsmDevice (and default to 1). after setting this (no reboot required), a new option appears under the mobile networks menu (settings&gt;more&gt;mobile network&gt;network mode). then set LTE/GSM/WCDMA. this sticks upon reboot and I have had exactly zero issues with LTE. and it is FAST

1354918127.0	14gtsg	How I bought a Nexus 4 living in Norway	Nimsim	31	6	36	"Making this post since it seems many have asked about this, but I don't see a good guide for it when googling. 

So I've been drooling over the Nexus 4 for months now, and yesterday I finally ordered one. There are 2 reasons why I didn't buy it in Norway. 
A) Price. The nexus 4 costs 670 dollars from the cheapest online store, shipping not included but probably about 15$ extra. 
B) Availability. The nexus won't be here until late in December. 

Now, I tried as everybody else to buy it on launch day, but it was sold out before I could get online. 
The second time I logged on through a vpn, but this time my credit card was rejected by Google. Your billing address has to be the same as the country you're ordering from. Want a device from USA? Well, then you need a CC with an American billing address. 

So, for all of you wondering how to do this. 

1. Get a VPN, I already have this because of US Netflix and Hulu. I use [HideMyAss](http://www.hidemyass.com) vpn which is quick, easy and fast. 

2. Get [Entropay](http://www.entropay.com) or some other virtual credit card. This one doesn't have a billing address, so you can put in your own. They take 5% of whatever amount you load your card with. I loaded for 395 (the total sum of a Nexus 4 + tax and shipping). 

3. Either ask a friend, or use one of the MANY forwarders that take your package and ship it to you. For nordic countries, [jet carrier](http://www.jetcarrier.com) is easy, cheap and gives you an address in USA. Set your billing address as this one and you're set to go! "	t5_2v9bv	True

I never bothered with android before, I always dismissed people who said android over apple. Apple was the way to go (back when I had an iphone4).

Fast forward to today, lost my iphone last year, used a blackberry for a good while, now bought my nexus4. When I start showing people, and we do the little switch were I look at their android, and they look at mine, I notice theirs is shit. 

I don;t even care I just have to say it, the design is so bad, it looks all blocky.. and just bad. Like playing a PS3 then playing an N64 afterwards (nostalgia aside). I don't know what happened with the Nexus 4, but they pulled their socks up on this phone. It's so smooth and surpasses the iPhone in so many ways. Sure it has a better camera, but after holding my friends iPhone recently.. I just felt so restricted. You're so locked in to their crap.

Many people (myself included) have had their Nexus 4 randomly power off since updating to 4.3. When I got my Chromecast, the issue worsened - my phone was constantly powered off when I tried to unlock it, and required a lengthy power button press to turn back on.

The actual issue is that the Netflix app causes your phone to freeze while locked, giving it the appearance of being powered off. This is not Nexus 4 exclusive, and Netflix and Google are both working to resolve it.

So, if you use the Netflix app on your Nexus 4 (and especially if you have a Chromecast!) either stick to 4.2.2 or uninstall the Netflix app until the issue is fixed.

As for backing up my apps and settings, what do I do? To my knowledge, to update to CM 10.1.2, I just have to flash it and wipe the dalvic cache. What about to other ROMs though? Do I have to do a factory reset? If so, do I use apps like Titanium backup to backup everything and restore everything after a factory reset? And what exactly can be backed up? I can easily pull out pictures by USB but things like accounts and individual app settings, can they be backed up as well? I don't really care for SMS and my calendar and tasks are synced online but I want to have a go to procedure for each time I flash, like a checklist of a sort.

ITT: You can just Titanium or Helium backup to back up all app + app data and just restore after a factory reset. Titanium backup doesn't have SMS but is more customizable. "	t5_2v9bv	True

1370641980.0	1fw2oj	Review: Zens 7-coil universal QI charger	bishop_brennan	32	7	6	"I've been waiting several months for the official charging orb to arrive in the UK, but finally gave up and purchased the [Zens Universal QI Charger](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Zens-Universal-Wireless-Charging-Smartphones/dp/B00AW8TCSG) (£38 from Amazon UK). This is my first experience with a wireless charger, and on the whole I've been very impressed.

[Some photos are available here](http://imgur.com/a/a9CLX). I don't have another camera to hand, so can't take a photo of the phone on the pad, but I've included a credit-card sized card for comparison.

**Charging placement (4/5)**

One of the main reasons I held off buying a QI charger until now is that many people seemed to find aligning the device on the 'sweet spot' of most charging pads to be difficult.

The key selling point of this pad is that it contains seven charging coils, meaning that an exact alignment of the phone on the pad isn't necessary; rather, the device just has to be placed over a relatively large charging area.

So does it work? In a word, yes. The charging area is marked out on the left side of the pad - as long as the corresponding coil in the Nexus 4 is placed over this area, then it charges perfectly. The pad is smaller than the Nexus 4, and it is possible to 'miss' the charging area if you're not looking and leave the Nexus overhanging the top or bottom too much. However, there is there is a lot of leeway (a couple of inches in each direction), and placing the device correctly on the pad is very easy.

I use the official N4 bumper, which doesn't seem to cause any problems.


**Charging time (5/5)**

I've found the charging time to be comparable (maybe slightly higher) to using an AC charger, though have no other experience with QI chargers to compare this with. Since I charge overnight, I haven't measured this exactly. When the battery is fully charged, the charger will trickle charge the battery - when I pick my phone up in the morning, the battery level is always between 95-100%. The N4 gets a little warm when charging, but nothing too bad. 

**Design/build quality (4/5)**

The pad seems well made, and is made of a slightly rubbery plastic which has a nice feel. A sticky foam pad is included if you have problems with the N4 sliding off, but since I use the bumper I didn't use it. There is an LED to indicate the pad is charging, which is dim enough that it doesn't bother me at night, even though it's just a few inches from my head. There is no beeper.

The pad is very small (smaller in length than the N4) and thin. The only downside to this is that the top or bottom of the N4 will overhang, and as I said above, if you're not looking, it is possible to place the N4 so that it misses the charging area. This isn't a major issue though, as long as the device is vaguely in the middle and to the left of the pad, it charges just fine. In two weeks of daily usage, I've placed it properly first time every time.

**TL;DR - a great charging pad, with a large charging area that works just as it claims to. Highly recommended**"	t5_2v9bv	True

1360263446.0	182vd8	After a few weeks of keen observation and testing, I'm pretty certain I know why Mediaserver shows up on the battery usage screen.	androlover	35	9	7	"A while back, I remember MANY posts about mediaserver draining batteries. A lot of people were suggesting that Google Play music might be causing it by constantly scanning the SD card for files or that there might be corrupted files, but it was showing up even when people did not have Play installed. Even when I added .nomedia files to most of the bigger folders in my SD card, it was still showing up.

I've come to realize that mediaserver is actually responsible for ANY audio that comes from your phone's speaker (aside from voice calls.) It first became apparent to me when I was playing Ingress a lot. Mediaserver would always show up whenever I played Ingress. Then, after charging the battery to 100% and removing the charger, I went into settings &gt; sound &gt; phone ringtones and started messing around with all the ringtones and playing all of them, and what do you know? Mediaserver usage shot up. This is most easily noticeable after the phone has been fully charged because mediaserver would only be using a very small portion of the total battery (but a large portion of used battery.) I urge you to try it yourself if you're still curious about mediaserver. 

Finally, I again notice mediaserver usage whenever I use Pandora. I guess this might be expected? I'm not sure, but everything that I read prior to realizing all of this pointed to the notion that mediaserver spends an awful amount of time scanning the file system for media files. I don't think that's the case with Pandora though, which seems like it would just be streaming the data from the network directly into memory. Please correct me if I'm wrong about this.

Anyways, I'm glad that I now know why mediaserver shows up and that it's nothing to worry about. I hope this was helpful to those who might still be concerned about mediaserver using up their battery as well and be sure to test it for yourself!"	t5_2v9bv	True

Later that day, I investigated the box more, and I noticed that the packing slip had the wrong name and address. An address 1800 miles away from where I live and the Nexus 4 was delivered. 

At first I thought this wouldn't be a problem. Clerical error, Google could update the record showing that *I* had the device with this Serial number and IMEI, not the guy on the packing slip.

So I contacted Google. I let them know that the packing slip had the wrong information. They first asked for the name and address on the slip. Easy enough.

At the beginning of the next business day, I got one of the most incomprehensible emails I've ever received, especially the first part of the first sentence:

&gt;Hello BostonGraver, 
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for contacting Google,
&gt;
&gt;If the package is successfully delivered in spite of the delivery, you can still refuse delivery of unopened packages within 5 days of delivery. To do so, contact our shipping provider directly to schedule a pick up of your package. Make sure to let them know that the pickup is specifically because you're refusing delivery.
&gt;
&gt;IMPORTANT: Don't open the package. Our shipping provider will not allow refusal of delivery for opened packages.

As I could read it, it said, ""If the package was delivered even though that it was delivered, you can refuse delivery"". Ok. But there were two things wrong with this email

1. I had no intention of sending the device back. I ordered it. I wanted it.
2. I **HAD** to open the box to see the incorrect packing slip, so UPS would not take it back, even if I tried. 


I shot back an email within minutes. A couple hours later, I got another response saying an RMA had been issued, and I was to return the device. I sent another email back explaining that I did want to keep the device, wondering why I would have to go without the phone because the packing slip was wrong, as if it was my fault. Fifteen minutes later, I was asked for the serial number on the box. I gave it, and also said that the IMEI on the packing slip matched the phone's IMEI. My contact point said ""I see that device belongs to someone else"".

He then said that unless I sent it back, this device would be unable to receive Warranty work. Then said I had to RMA it again. The RMA details include this line:
&gt; - Restocking fee of 15% if package is opened; no restocking fee for unopened packages.

Oh man was I mad. I sent another message back pointing out that because of Google's logistical error:

* Unless I sent the phone back, I would not have any kind of warranty on it. And if I sent it back:
* I wouldn't have a phone for the time it took me to ship it, Google to process it, send out a new one, and the transit time for that phone
* I would be paying for cell service I couldn't use during that time.
* I would have to pay $53 for the privilege of not having a phone and wasting cell service because I had opened the box of the device I ordered. 

I offered some helpful suggestions like sending me a replacement FIRST, and charging me if I didn't return the other device, or simply transferring the device to my name.

My email was forwarded to ""a specialist"". Two days passed, and I just received another email.


This email contained a link to Google Checkout for another Nexus 4. It was a special link that only places a hold on the card unless I don't return the original device. I was sent a UPS label, and I have 21 days from the day I receive the replacement to send this one back and the authorization will be removed. The Google Play confirmation email I got was even specifically drafted for this purpose, so I'm confused why they didn't just do this in the first place. Maybe they assumed I'd rather go without a phone than have a $349 authorization charge on my debit/credit card? They should have at least asked that in the first email 6 days ago.


So after almost an entire week, Google does the right thing. Things could have gone a bit smoother, but I'm glad this was taken care of (eventually).

tl;dr:

If your Nexus 4 had someone else's information on the packing slip, tell google you want an auth hold on your card so they can send you a new one first before you send yours back. If you don't get it replaced, you aren't covered by the warranty."	t5_2v9bv	True

What about other privacy issues?  I mean I guess it's kind of moot given that I already use gmail and facebook and have a cell phone, but I want to ensure that I *know* when the phone is sending usage information and location information to third parties.

So what's the deal?

Spent all day trying to figure out why my mobile data stopped working.  Rebooting, checking the sim card, updating the apn, and more.  Their customer service is a joke.  Calls to support are being dropped after 15 minutes of the automated hold.  The web support ticket mechanism crashes when I submit too.

Then I find [this](http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/03/04/net10-caps-att-data-at-1-5gb-per-month-t-mobile-remains-unlimited/).  Argh!
