Until the end, I didn't understand that I, too was living in a simulation.

My simulation encompasses nearly every living moment. It's Magic: The Gathering. It's books. It's TV. It's YouTube. It's this fucking site right here that I spend hours glued to.

My simulation is tailored perfectly to my interests. It's a bubble of satisfaction and distraction. It's a place where I can solve immense problems creatively and hear moving, deeply human stories. In my simulation, life is easy and there are so many good things to do.

But in the real world I have grown weak. I've become recalcitrant to discipline, and even the most menial tasks-- organizing my binders for classes, for example-- are postponed for days. I'm more socially awkward now than I was in high school. I've been in college for several months now, and I haven't even gotten a girl's number. I can't face myself in the mirror. I can't live like this anymore. 

As long as I use media to escape my problems, I will be dead inside.

When I look away from my phone and computer and out of my window, I remember my dreams. I want to be a distance runner and a biologist and a lover and a father and everyone's favorite goofy drunk. I want faces, not usernames. I want hugs, not that fucking Reddit Gold crap.

So goodbye, Reddit. You've been wonderful, but I have things to do and be. Where I'm going, there's no room for imaginary friends.

1333489429.0	rrtg4	A step-by-step method for learning languages to fluency	gwyner	306	55	66	"I needed to learn to speak 3-4 languages over the past few years for my job, and in the process have landed on a pretty damn good method.  It got me to C1 fluency in French in about 5 months, and I'm currently using it with Russian (and plan on reaching C1 equivalent fluency by September).  At this point, I go in 4 stages:





* Stage 1: Learn the correct pronunciation of the language.  Doing this does a few things –  because I’m first and foremost learning how to hear that language’s sounds, my listening comprehension gets an immediate boost before I even start traditional language age learning.  Once I start vocabulary training, I retain it better because I’m familiar with how words should sound and how they should be spelled.  (Correct spellings in French, for example, are much easier to remember when there’s a connection between the spelling and the sound), and once I finally start speaking to native speakers, they don't switch to English for me or dumb down their language, which is awesome sauce.  If you're learning a language with a different alphabet, this is where you learn the phonetic alphabet(s) (Kana, for Japanese or Pinyin for Chinese, for example)

 



* Stage 2: Vocabulary and grammar acquisition (itself in a few stages), no English allowed.
I start with a frequency list and mark off any words I can portray with pictures alone (basic nouns and verbs).  I put those in an [Anki deck](http://www.towerofbabelfish.com/Tower_of_Babelfish/Anki.html) and learn them.  Once I have some words to play with, I start putting them together.  I use Google translate (Exception to no English rule - just be careful there's no English in your Anki deck) and a grammar book to start making sentences, then get everything double-checked at lang-8.com before putting them into my Anki deck.  Turning them into fill-in-the-blank flashcards builds the initial grammar and connecting words.  As vocab and grammar grow, I eventually move to monolingual dictionaries and writing my own definitions for more abstract words (again doublechecked at lang-8.com).  This builds on itself; the more vocab and grammar you get, the more vocab and grammar concepts you can describe in the target language.  Eventually you can cover all the words in a 2000 word frequency list as a foundation and add any specific vocab you need for your own interests.





* Stage 3: Listening, writing and reading work
Once I have a decent vocabulary and familiarity with grammar, I start writing essays, watching TV shows and reading books, and talking (mostly to myself) about the stuff I see and do.  Every writing correction gets added to the Anki deck, which continues to build my vocab and grammar.





* Stage 4: Speech
At the point where I can more or less talk (haltingly, but without too many grammar or vocab holes) and write about most familiar things, I find some place to immerse in the language and speak all the time (literally.  No English allowed or else you won't learn the skill you're trying to learn, which is adapting to holes in your grammar or vocabulary by going around them rapidly and automatically without having to think about it).  I prefer Middlebury college, but a few weeks in the target country will work as well if you're very vigorous with sticking to the target language and not switching to English.  If you're extremely strict with yourself, your brain adapts pretty quickly and learns how to put all the info you learned in stages 1-3 together quickly enough to turn into fluent speech.

That's what the headline says, but actually she's beautiful, it's her baby that's ugly. It's because she had extensive plastic surgery, and her husband sued her for marrying under false pretenses.

I posted this here because it's something I think about from time to time. There was an _Extreme Makeover_ episode some years ago, where two people were given extensive plastic surgery. They had problems that went beyond just being ugly, like having teeth much too big for their mouth, and pretty severe facial asymmetry. And then because of the show, and because of their new faces, they met and fell in love.

So it made me wonder what might happen as a result of plastic surgery to some children in the future. If the parents were already messed up, and then two messed up people passed their genes to their children, the consequences could be painful. And in the case of this story, somewhat tragic, even though the wife in this case wasn't exactly messed up, just somewhat unattractive. To me, this story has some of the elements of a good fable or a fairy tale, or at least an indie movie."	t5_2rete	True

I've actually been thinking about this topic and how it relates to me for a while. The older generations seem to think we're getting lazier, but I think it's really that we know the current system is unsustainable and is breaking. The problem is that we haven't reached a critical mass of confident, coordinated people in our generation to take over and replace it. I don't want to work for a company that makes a profit by dropping clients or whose CEOs get ridiculous salaries while the lower rungs get jack. I want to make a living by adding to our society, not just chasing dollars til I die. I know I'm not the only one; I've had a lot of conversations with friends about depression/anxiety, the inability to keep our heads above water financially, or how our entire political system is a quagmire. Maybe our generation is boomeranging home because we're getting a taste of independence and finding ourselves in an extremely hostile, if civil environment: politically, socially, and professionally. It seems everybody is out to screw over everybody else in all areas of life. The paradigm of Capitalism is looking more and more like Opportunism. Opportunistic behavior –political, social and professional—is everywhere and it's clearly visible. Why grow up when that's all that's waiting for us? What incentives have the previous generations given us to take the reins of their civilization? I think factors like increased knowledge, the steady increase of communication and information access, and relative peace inside Western civilizations' borders since WWII has produced this generation that sees the Prisoner's Dilemma advantage of cooperation over competition. And we want to try it, dammit. I think with this recession, we're looking at a lot of youth implicitly/subconsciously going on strike by refusing to grow up. In a very real way, growing up is a scary thought, and the thought of having to put my head down and work in this environment with no real prospect of fulfillment or happiness just seems absurd. But I've realized that the answer isn't going to just smack me in the face. No politician, businessman, or judge can come along and make everything sugar and rainbows for everyone. I think we need to network our skills with each other to create our own jobs and our own industry. We need to start thinking critically and laterally to figure out what we want to add to our environment, then find people that will help us accomplish it. Maybe we should all just take that plunge of growing up and promise to help each other on the other side."	t5_2rete	True

""It would have been very comforting indeed to believe that Eichmann was a monster . . . The trouble with Eichmann was precisely that so many were like him, and that the many were neither perverted nor sadistic, that they were, and still are terribly and terrifyingly normal.""

- Hannah Arendt, Eichmann In Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil



Unless you've been living under a rock (cue Geico) you've probably heard the infectious single by Foster the People called  ""Pumped Up Kicks"" on the radio this past year.

What you may or may not have noticed, though, is that that sunny 60's-soul-soaked song is really about an alienated, psychotic teen fantasizing about (or even considering) shooting and killing his classmates at school. 

I've been wanting to tackle this song for a while now - but it was only after watching Terrence Malick's first film Badlands last week that something clicked. I quickly made the above video, confident that the song and the film can illuminate and explain each other.

Here's why.

In an interview he gave last summer, Mark Foster of Foster the People explained the song this way:
""The song is about a teenage kid that is trapped, isolated, and basically hates his life. So he's pretty much fantasizing going on a killing spree...More kids are getting guns, and shooting people, and these things are happening younger and younger, 14 or 13 years old. It's turning into an epidemic for American youth. I wanted to infiltrate, and dig beneath the surface and get into the psychology of what's going on in a kid's mind like that.""

On the band's Wikipedia, we also learn that:

""The issue of youth violence is a matter close to the group. Foster was bullied in high school, while bassist Cubbie Fink has a cousin who survived the Columbine High School massacre...
Foster believes many have misinterpreted the song's meaning, and he has written letters to his record label and called radio stations to complain. He explained, 'The song is not about condoning violence at all. It's the complete opposite.'""

Foster makes some important points - while the tragedies of Columbine and Virginia Tech probably stand out as two of the most tragic, there has been an alarming increase in shooting incidents at schools in recent years. It's important that artists tackle the issue by drawing our attention to the hearts and souls of those alienated, bullied, and lost youth who feel like violence is their only option.

Admittedly, though, this subject has been tackled quite a bit, especially in music. Pre-Columbine, Pearl Jam was tapping into the psychology of just such a young person with the song and video ""Jeremy""; post-Columbine, goth-rock group Korn's single ""Thoughtless"" is about ""a bullied teenager who dreams of killing his tormentors,"" and POD's ""Youth of the Nation"" describes a school shooting in the first verse.

But all of these songs predictably reflect their subject matter - the music itself is dark, violent, and disorienting. It's what we'd expect an alienated, angry youth's thoughts to ""sound' like, and allows us to distance ourselves from them, even though we remain empathetic.

What makes ""Pumped Up Kicks"" unique is the juxtaposition of the dark, violent content with its blasé, even charming sound. We're swept up into the song, expecting lyrics about summer love or beach parties - when suddenly, those strange phrases whiz by us like bullets: ""you better run, better run, outrun my gun.""

The lyrics are particularly horrifying because of their context - the song is not insanely angry nor insanely happy. There's not anything there to signify the insane or even dangerous - its exterior is casual, smooth, and easy-going.

Foster the People's snappy groove flouts our tidy expectations, thereby forcing us to step into the singer's world before we even know what's happened. As one blogger writes, "" I was so engrossed with the cheery melody of its chorus that it took me a few listens to discover that the lyrics suggest dark, Columbine revenge.""

This was also my experience of the song - and after watching Badlands for the first time, I realized that it would have been a good fit for the original soundtrack.

First, there is a literal connection: Malick's first film is also about a cigarette-smoking wanna-be cowboy (""Kit"") who decides one day, with an air of aloof indifference, to start killing. Kit lures his young girlfriend Holly into his senseless crime spree, which plays out against a very Midwestern background that reflects Kit's attitude (one reviewer called the scenery ""breathtaking both in its sweep and in its banality"").

The characters of Kit and Holly are alienated from the world, and deeply self-involved - especially Kit, who seems to only understand himself as the star of a James Dean movie. In the words of actor Martin Sheen: ""These kids, both Kit and Holly, had an image of themselves that was way out of the realm of reality.""

But even though they're deluded and dangerous, they still come across as somewhat sweet, simple, and even bored with themselves and their actions - and the effect is terrifying.

As one reviewer wrote:  ""Sheen conveys Kit's craziness so effectively because he does not ever act the madman."" They shrug, smoke, and mutter across the plains - all the while feeling, as Holly puts it, ""kind of blah, like a bathtub after the water has all gone down the drain."" They are - like the singer in ""Pumped Up Kicks"" - all too casual.

Badlands, then, makes an artistic move similar to ""Pumped Up Kicks."" Rather than playing off of our expectations of ""the bad guy"" and allowing us to distance ourselves, the film makes us cozy up to the unexceptional, even charming exterior that harbors evil, in order to really see it and understand its ""banality.""

The ""banality of evil"" is a phrase coined by Hannah Arendt during the trail of Nazi Adolf Eichmann, and was applied in a stricter sense to matters of work and duty to the state. But the idea is this: evil is ""terribly and terrifyingly normal."" It is often the work of ordinary people that are just doing, as they see it, what has to get done to advance themselves or even just to ""get from point A to point B.""

Although evil is banal, Arendt thought that one couldn't do it without a measure of thoughtlessness and remoteness from reality. She writes:

""It was sheer thoughtlessness—something by no means identical with stupidity—that predisposed him to become one of the greatest criminals of that period...such remoteness from reality and such thoughtlessness can wreak more havoc than all the evil instincts taken together...""

This notion reflects a Thomistic idea of evil, with its roots in St. Augustine: evil is not a ""thing"" or a ""being,"" but a privatio boni, or ""lack of good."" Good can exist without evil - but evil can't exist without good. Evil is a parasite of the good, with no real essence.

Of course, none of this means that we identify or even empathize with the violence of either the song or the movie - no more than Arendt identified with Eichmann.

But maybe it means that we are forced to confront their humanity, and in doing so, better understand our own casual inclinations toward evil, and evil itself. This is not a comfortable process - it's also a hard thing to convey properly in art without coming across as ""glorifying"" or ""making light of"" evil.

I understand most people will probably have some reservations about getting excited about a song that, at the end of the day, is a happy song about a teenager fantasizing about killing people. It's hard to get around that. Won't most young people miss the nuanced message?

We cannot change the inevitable. 

The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude. I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it. And so it is with you... we are in charge of our Attitudes.”

1347556340.0	ztwx8	An interesting, insightful, and somewhat motivational email I received this morning from my Father. (Xpost from True Reddit)	SnoozeDude	177	43	9	"I'm not sure as to whether this belongs here, but I think, and hope, you all may find it intriguing and maybe take something away from it. For clarification, when my Dad says ""Bg"", he is referring to his home country of Bulgaria. The email is copied and pasted in full below:

""Boys, I had an experience flying to Bg I thought I should tell you about. Checking in for my flight to Sofia at Heathrow, I saw an old guy staring at me intently. It was a highschool buddy of mine I last saw in 1969. A little ancient history here to put things into context.

I had two groups of close friends in highschool that were distinct. One was a group of very smart folks (four of them) you might call the brainiacs. I met them through playing bridge and chess. We were all jazz &amp; American literature fans and hated the commies. I was the only one that did not speak fluent English among them. One was shot dead at 18 trying to escape, one won the international math Olympics at 18 and became a renowned theoretical mathematician, another is an emeritus professor of Chemistry and one became a drunk and died at 50. I still see the two guys that are aroound.The other bunch, also four, were essentially rock&amp;rollers and hippies. They formed a band (two guitars, bass and drums) and eventually became professional. I was the only one that did not play an instrument, but once they made me sing with them at a night club to the huge discomfort of the listening public (check out Bonna Sera Signorina, by Louis Prima, him of Jungle Book fame). They all drank excessively and are all gone now, except the drummer who is the guy that stared at me.

And here is the rest of the story. After sitting together on the plane and reminiscing for a couple of hours, Minyo (short for Marin in Bg) told me that God had sent me to him at this particular moment. I told him that this must be worth at least a drink to God and two to me, so I'll take an IOU for three of them. All of sudden he turned serious and started crying. He then told me that I had given him $500 (of which I have no recollection) when he first came to the U.S. in 1969 and he had not been able to find me to pay me back and had nightmares that God will punish him for that (he had become religious in the meantime). He said that he had written to all the Bg newspapers I had written for or was interviewed by to ask for a contact to no avail.

Anyway, as we got off the plane, he pulled out $500 and started pushing it in my pocket which I resisted and as result we must have looked like two old Jews fighting over a chicken in the shtetl market so a cop came to see what was going on. While I was telling the cop off, Minyo disappeared and I was left holding the money. So the moral of the story, as you go through life be as generous as your circumstances permit - it always comes back in one way or another. Dad""

There will come a time when things are automated to the point that the needs of society can be met by only a small fraction of the population (and their machines). Under socialism, Shaw argued, this is cause for celebration as it means that everyone gets more leisure time. Under capitalism, again - according to Shaw, this will be a disaster as the displaced workers are left to the mercy of ""the haves"".

I think we're getting to the point Shaw foresaw. Business owners are making logical and necessary moves by replacing expensive humans with cheap mechanization wherever possible. The percent of the population that is involved in agriculture has dropped by an order of magnitude over the past hundred years; it's not just agriculture: jobs are getting chipped away by machines in nearly every sector. It's hard to think of a single industry that hasn't benefited (aka: requires less man hours) due to technology. It's easy to see how this is good for profits and bottom lines, while simultaneously detrimental to the hourly workers of our world.

I suspect that increasing mechanization is partially behind the current OWS ""debate"". Profits have grown (for the owners/CEOs) thanks to machines while the need for hired help has fallen. No one's wrong per se: the CEOs have done what's right for their bottom line and the unemployed want to work but they are no longer needed. 

So... isn't it possible that we're getting to the point where the needs of society can be completely met without help from everyone? If so, the trend is only going to continue. On paper it's a great problem to have: there's not enough work to keep everyone busy. Hooray! If we don't change something though, this glut of leisure time (a good thing) is going to look strikingly like disastrous unemployment (a bad thing). What to do?"	t5_2rete	True

And I'm terrified. 	thealterego	266	143	62	"Today, as I was trying to get my backpack out of my car, I made a startling-and to me, rather unsettling-realization. You see, my parking spot is squeezed in in such a way that a small, but very beautiful lilac tree blocks the right rear passenger door from opening more than half a foot at the widest. Now, to get my bag would be simple, just reach in through the opposite door. However, the first thought that crossed my mind was ""fuck this tree, I'll just cut it out of my way and not have to worry about it."" This, as opposed to a relatively simple action that takes slightly more effort. If THIS is how oil tycoons view switching to alternate energy sources, or how rainforest loggers view using recycled products, or how anyone in power views the long term solution, we have a much harder job to do if we want to stop these fuckers from wrecking the world. Because I will tell you, I was just about to go and get that saw, despite how pretty the tree is in the spring and summer months as it buzzes with life. Luckily, I stepped back and thought. How can we make these people do the same thing?

EDIT: To be honest, this post was made in the heat of what I believed to be an interesting personal discovery. I'm truely quite ignorant when it comes to those industries that I mentioned. I simply meant to acknowledge the problems that exist and introduce a line of thought that I found intriguing. Apologies to those experts who have so graciously corrected my missteps when it comes to referencing the incredibly complicated issues I sampled.
