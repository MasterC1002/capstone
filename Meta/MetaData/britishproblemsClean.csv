YourPalRob	1175	194	123	"It was 2PM in Asda, people came, people went, that stupid fucking Take That song you've heard for the billionth time repeated itself yet again over the PA system much to the joy of the fat bird who reckons she's X Factor material as she puts in an effort to give  you tinnitus while roaming the aisles... God I hate those women. Indeed 2PM is a strange time in Asda, the workies are back doing what ever it is they do and Students are back either pretending to work or having some alone time in a locked bathroom stall. This is the time when Asda is quiet, just a few unemployed people who look like extras from The Walking Dead are left openly staring at burgers and the elderly who just hold everything up. Then I came along, in an entrance some would say was modest for the feat I was about to achieve. Everyone knows the trolley surfing game, you run, run like Usain Bolt on coke for just a few steps and then you jump and hold on to your Asda branded chariot as it thunders down the aisle...I did just this. As I soared down the aisle like the final race in Cool Runnings right past the assortment of coffees and teabags and into the crossroads I was half expecting a crowd waiting for me in delight, I felt like I'd broken the world record. It even made that horrible sound like you've just shoved turkey stuffing up Susan Boyle's arse. But there was no medals, no crowd, no kid staring at me like I was Mr Incredible... Just a sole old woman who said 4 words ""Act yer bloody age"" she didn't even film my bloody world record... She didn't even have a fucking camera phone and just like that my short lived dreams of a lucrative ITV deal in which Splash! becomes Trolley! and Nike practically spew apondership money at me were killed by a sole old woman."	t5_2sumw	True

EDIT: Wow, this kind of, exploded. A lot of people seem to be misunderstanding my view on this, so I'll explain:

The title was sarcasm. I think discrimination, negative or positive, is at best detrimental and at worst despicable. As such, my problem with this news is that the bank gave their reason for adding Jane Austen to the new set as them needing to have a woman, rather than because they believed her contributions to be great enough.

My other gripe is that I personally believe Jane Austen to be a bad choice. This is not because I believe her contribution to be inferior to anyone elses' but because she is already widely famous. I remember when I first noticed Elizabeth Fry on a fiver and it compelled me to find out who she was. I believe that there are many great people, several of which have been mentioned here, that are much more in need of the unique recognition that this brings, and I feel that including Ms. Austen, who is already a household name, is wasting an opportunity to celebrate someone whose contributions would otherwise go unnoticed.

I sincerely apologise to anyone who misunderstood and took offence."	t5_2sumw	True

edit: She's from Brighton. Her conversational English is limited, rivaling only one of those third world footballers who left school at six years old to sell drugs before escaping the favela for a better place.
She is incredibly butch and has a comically deep voice that she exaggerates when speaking to men, which is hilarious because she's about the same height as me, at five feet nothing, and looks like a boy still in primary school. Also, it seems she does shake hands, only with the lads who live here. Apparently it's ""very firm"".

I don't know the full extent of her philistine existence but she retuned the kitchen radio from 4 to 1, has never heard of Joy Division, asked what the point of record collecting is and upon seeing a record player said that her brother does some DJ stuff at weekends and has even met Tiesto, who is a ""legend"". She hates cats. We have four.

The landlord, who lives on the property, won't actually like her anymore than we do and is only doing this as a favour to the girl's dad (who's actually really civilised) and has not met the girl yet.

Im thinking of it being set in a fictional industrial northern city, something like a parody of Liverpool during the decline of the 80s. You'd have loads of awesome classic cars, a gritty but more entertaining tone than GTA4, greater emphasis on melee combat like Sleeping Dogs, traditional British gangster guns, inspiration from countless British cult classic films, and of course the greatest soundtrack to ever grace gaming filled with punk, ska, progressive rock, new wave and such perfect for every car chase. There's social movements going on for R* to incorporate like the Mod Revival and what better time period for the story to take place, there's a lot of room here for R* to do as they like but no doubt it would involve a lot of exploration of social issues and poking fun at Thatcherism. Perhaps keep the usual rags to riches theme of most GTAs? Other issues like immigration or the cold war could play a part. Characters would range from skinheads to your GTA classics, corrupt police, dodgy union bosses and morally destitute politicians. Now i'll remind you none of this will ever happen.
