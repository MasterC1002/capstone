Yesterday was a good day... Work went well, had a nice drive home and was even lucky enough to see a few eagles soaring as I pulled into the drive.   My beard was looking great, after 4 months of care I'd managed to sculpt it into a force to be reckoned with.  We were inseparable.  My beard was known for me, and I for my beard.  Working at a bank, you don't often see those manly enough to sport a facial feature.  We were best friends and didn't care who knew.

Upon walking through the door the wife and kid greeted me with open arms.  My daughter jumping into my arms and immediately stroking my face while saying ""Daddy I missed you today!"".  A rustic smile crossed my face as I realized that the second half of my day would be great, much like the first.  We sat down as a family to enjoy expertly prepared Mississippi Roast leftovers.  90seconds on high, re-salt, and accompanied by pan seared green beans.

After dinner, the kid and I played around with daddy being the horsey until I felt my knees would bleed.  Wifey then came by, scooped up the little girl to usher her to her bath, and gave me that wink which every married man knows the meaning of.  Tonight was indeed going to be a continuation of the fantastical great day that I'd had thus far.

With the fam occupied, I decided I'd retire to the master bath and groom the beard.  It'd been a long day but I needed to make sure that I groomed because I may not have the energy to do so after an evening romp.  Busting out all the necessary utensils I began a process that had become almost second nature since my awkward beginnings with my man mane.  

Warm lather with razor to fine tune the edge, scissor trim those weird hairs that seem to grow right under my nose, then time to bust out the power tools.  Wahl electric trimmer...new...I'd recently upgraded from a rechargable as it just didn't seem to get the job done without painful snags. Snap the guard on and comb everything out to ensure uniform trimming.  A quick flick of the switch and that familiar tune hums away as I bring the precision instrument to my face.

A sudden bog down coupled with an instant and complete feeling of utter dread.  What just happened, I instantly drop the tool to the ground.  It clacks on the floor and seems to echo eternally as I look into the mirror to see what my hands had just done.  A three inch long gash right in my beards midsection.  In slow motion I watched for what seemed an hour as the remnant of my beards heart fell to the floor.  What have I done? How could this have happened!?  I quickly glared at the instrument of betrayal and zoomed in on the ""3mm"" indicator on the guard... How could I have been so careless? I'd clipped the guard on a hundred times yet now I'd seemingly grabbed the wrong guard to my own dismay.  I look up again to assess the damage... Not repairable... completely visible... badly wounded and unable to be saved. I knew what I had to do...

I picked up the utensil of my best friend's demise and proceeded to finish the job, no beard should suffer the fate of seeing itself so badly wounded.  I had to make it quick.  I couldn't even look, I just depressingly ran it over my face and immediately walked away.  

My friend, my confidant... reduced to stubble... and it is my fault.  I am at a loss.
