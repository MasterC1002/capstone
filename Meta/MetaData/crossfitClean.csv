Here's my analogy: The Open is no different than running a 5K. Most people don't sign up for a 5K thinking they're going to win. They do it because it's a fun event with a group of people. So let's say you pay $30-40 to run a 5K - I could just as easily say ""LOL I can't believe you paid $40 just to get a time. I could go out and do the same run with a stopwatch or my phone to get my time for free!""

1374525500.0	1iu50e	Crossfit Programming	omrsafetyo	155	13	35	"When programming Crossfit, you basically need to split your clientele into 2 main camps:

* Those training for performance
* Those training for fat loss

They have very different needs.  Those training for fat loss can basically get away with the long metcon programming that we often find in some gyms.  They also typically benefit from strict Paleo, since it provides the results they are looking for.  You should definitely provide them with some strength training, as of course, increased muscle mass will decrease body fat by boosting metabolism.

I'm more concerned about the performance athlete.  For them, the work must be much more specialized, and a lot more thought needs to go into it.  And still, each athlete will have a different needs based on their own deficiencies. In most other sports, from (even hobbyist) powerlifting, to football there are definitive progressions for improving athlete performance.

For instance, in Powerlifting, you have linear strength programs.  There isn't much more to that, aside from perhaps some technique work.

In (American) Football, on top of strength training, there is a lot of speed and agility drills, running plays, etc.  But for Crossfit, training seems to vary pretty widely from gym to gym, from coach to coach.  This is due to the ""random"" nature of Crossfit programming touted by Glassman, and a mixture of inexperience in some gyms leading to following nothing specific; with experience at others which leads to a lot of experimentation based on some known variables.  But the sport itself is still changing, which means our methods must also change.

So what are the foundation concepts of Crossfit training, that can be built on to create a structured approach to developing Crossfit athletes?

**Strength Training**

There should definitely be a structured approach to develop athlete strength.  All the numbers in your competitive Crossfit athletes have gone up every year since the first games.  Jason Khalipa has increased his deadlift from 485# in 2009 to 550# going into the 2013 open.  His back squat has gone from 365# to 450#. His C&amp;J has gone from 275# to 335#.  In the same time, he has shaved only 6 seconds off his Fran time.  Strength is important.  Here are some good strength programs:

[Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/The_Starting_Strength_Novice/Beginner_Programs) - The best beginner program out there.  Linear in progression, you add weight every workout.  3x5 routine featuring Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press, Press, and Power Clean.

[Stronglifts 5x5](http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/) - Runner up for best beginner program.  Linear progression. 5x5 featuring Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press, Press, and Barbell Row.  You can choose this program if you want more volume than for SS, or if you prefer the Barbell Row because it's easier to teach than the Clean, and is great for balancing out back development in any program with the Bench Press.

[5/3/1 Beginner mod](http://www.jimwendler.com/2011/09/531-for-a-beginner/) - The Jim Wendler 5/3/1 tuned for a beginner.  The benefit of this program is there are only 2 main lifts per day in the core program, so it is faster than the other 2, and why it is frequently used for CrossFit athletes. Squat, Bench, Deadlift, Press.

[Madcow 5x5](http://stronglifts.com/madcow-5x5-training-programs/) - Intermediate Program. Same lifts as SL5x5, but with lower volume, and different rep scheme.

[Texas Method](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/the_texas_method) - Intermediate Program - Same lifts as Starting Strength. 5x5

[Wendler's 5/3/1](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/how_to_build_pure_strength) - Intermediate/Advanced. Same lifts as 5/3/1 Beginner mod.  1 main lift per day, which makes it easy to program with Crossfit - however, there is some specific accessory work that is highly recommended (which is typically missed in Crossfit programming) which includes strict/weighted chins, rows, good mornings, and hanging leg raises (these are what I see as important, personally).  Good phone apps available for this program.

[Stronglifts Advanced](http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-advanced-strength-muscle-building-training-program/) - Intermediate/Advanced program - Same lifts as the other SL programs.  Heavy volume (3 lifts/day)

Crossfit athletes should be doing Front Squat work, so I personally say take any program that squats more than once per week, and switch 1 BS for FS.

**Skill**

There are definitely some skills that should be practiced often, and some that should be worked every day.  I personally say for a competitive Crossfit athlete, include the [Burgener Warm-up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oG11fZ0TR8) in the warm-up routine 3-5 days per week.

Otherwise, skills that should be practiced at least 3-5 times per week (work them into the warm-up as skill work, not into the WOD where you will see a break down in form) include:
Pistols
Hand Stand Push-ups
Double-Unders

Skills for 2-4 times per week:
Strict/kipping pull-ups
Muscle-Ups
Clean &amp; Jerk
Snatch
Overhead Squat (even with just a PVC)

**Conditioning**

This is where you develop the athlete's motor.  The ability to sustain power output over a duration.  Generally in this portion of your programming, you should be looking at developing the Glyocolitic and Oxidative ATP pathways.  [Here is a link](http://www.crossfit.com/journal/library/10_03_metab_cond.pdf) to one of the CFJ articles on this subject.  

ATP-CP battery

This is development of recovery at near maximum efforts.  There is a great article on this at [Peak Athletic Development](http://peakathleticdevelopment.blogspot.com/2013/07/atp-cp-battery-why-absolute-strength.html).  Key points:

* Train using EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute) workouts (Alactic-Aerobic) near 55-75% of 1RM
* Train using Heavy Metcons (bottleneck) - something that mixes MetCon with a heavy or skill related movement, forcing you to rest 


Volume/Aerobic base

I think if you are training people at a CrossFit gym, you are hesitant to tell your athletes ""well, today instead of using my equipment, you're going to go run a 10K.""  So often this gets neglected.  Now, in Crossfit, we like to develop aerboic capacity at shorter intervals anyway - but IMO you should not neglect this entirely - so ensure you are encouraging your athletes to participate in local 5K, 10K, and Tough Mudder races.  It will help.  Otherwise, be sure to program active recovery days where you encourage your athlete to stay home, but go for a 30+ minute slow run.

This also includes longer WODs

* Jerry
* Cindy
* Chelsea
* Double Helen (Hell-in)
etc.

Lactate Threshold 

This is something we really focus on, and is often the aim of WODs.  This can be worked very similarly to ATP-CP, but with much lower loads.  Or, anything with short bursts of intensity followed by, which teaches your body to cycle lactic acid efficiently.

* Interval training.  [Here is a some Concept 2 recommended interval workouts](http://www.concept2.com/indoor-rowers/training/tips-and-general-info/anaerobic-threshold).  One WOD I have done was:

3 Rds AMRAP Double Unders;

With 2 minutes on the clock, run 400m, then complete as many DU in the remaining time.  Rest 2 minutes.

* [Tempo lifting](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/6_questions_about_tempo_training&amp;cr=). This is where you typically see funny notations that you might not be familiar with. This might include going through a few lifts (squat, deadlift, bench, front squat, press) where you work at 40-60% of your 1RM for 3-5 sets at 8-10 reps, resting for a specific amount of time between sets, and resting between movements for a longer time. [Here is an article](http://crossfitsurvival.com/2013/01/30/tempo-lifting-and-lactate-threshold-training/) on how you might structure a Crossfit Workout.
* Fight Gone Bad
* Tabata

**Mobility**

[Kelly Starrett on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/sanfranciscocrossfit)

[MobilityWod.com](http://www.mobilitywod.com/)

Can't really say anything better than the master.  But, I thought it was important to note that any good program will include mobility - injury proof yourself, and improve your recovery too.

Please contribute your thoughts and training philosophies!

1374076021.0	1ihpns	One year of Crossfit	Guntsational	160	18	34	"EDITED TO ADD PICTURE http://imgur.com/0uVfenV

Throw-away account as even though I'm proud as hell of my progress, not so good with bikini pics. Guess all those years of hiding my body doesn't change so easily.  

First off, I have severe asthma and was told by a lung specialist that I'd never be able to run or compete physically.  

This is one year of setting the alarm, fighting through reps, and trying new foods.  

This is one year of finishing last, writing a shitty time on the board and crying at particularly insane WODS (i'm looking at you, Karen).  

One year of thinking 'no f'ing way' but doing it anyway, wanting to quit at rep 7 when there are 150, and being outside of my comfort zone. Every. Single. Day.  

In this year there have been injury and hardship as life tends to happen. But the important thing is to never quit. Never ever quit. Crawling and crying is ok, quitting is not.  

Anyway, hope this helps someone if they are thinking it's too hard and not for them. It's supposed to be hard. That's where the change happens. You will find out what you're made of and that there is greatness in you.  

PS - since starting CrossFit I've also been inspired to run some 5k's and finish the Spartan Race. So that lung specialist can kiss my anus."	t5_2qqfd	True

1364694054.0	1bc2mh	Started Crossfit in 2000...	dirtpuppy	122	15	19	"...when I joined the military. Back then a group of us, who had aspirations for Air Force special operations, began training daily. Running, calisthenics and weight; standard nothing fancy. Then one of us found Crossfit on the internet and thought it was the craziest thing.

We began to read the WOD's off the site and tried to see if we could do them. Keep in mind, we had no olympic lift equipment, no KB's, no rings, no standard Crossfit equipment; just basic weight room stuff. More importantly, we had no coaches besides whatever was on crossfit.com. We eventually were told we could not do that type of training in the gym and to settle down.
The next 9 years of my military career I implemented Crossfit when I could but mostly was left to running, rucking and swimming. Little by little, military gyms started to get more equipment suitable for Crossfit type workouts and I did what I could as best as I could. I screamed for joy when my base got a rower; that meant I could do certain RX'd WOD's!!

We essentially taught ourselves how to do bar muscle-ups (no rings yet), Turkish get-ups, power cleans and jerks (no bumper plates yet, that means controlled lowering of the bar from overhead) and all that Crossfit has to offer. After returning stateside for CONUS assignments, I tried to join my first box but flipped the finger when I saw the price tag for a membership. I did not make nearly enough on an enlisted mans salary to afford that, so I stuck to my piece-meal Crossfit routine at the base gym until I separated in 2009.

Now, on the GI Bill, making even less money, I knew I could not join a Crossfit gym even if I wanted to. No matter, my university's gym had olympic barbells and olympic lifting platforms boxes, complete with bumper plates! Up until this point, I never had bumper plates, this meant that I could go for heavier weight and more repititions to failure. Again, I had to rely on the internet to show me the proper forms for the lift.

After a while, I got pretty good but not having professional instruction, I refrained from going too heavy on certain lifts. About this time, Crossfit is massive. I mean its on ESPN; what a change from 2000 when none knew what this was. even at my universities gym, I would get weird looks as I did handstand push-ups against the wall, toes to bars, burps and wall ball shots.

I was 30 and outperforming 18-22 year old kids. I even could rig up a plyo-box out of a bunch of iron plates; Id never used one up to this point. I had always felt like a Crossfitter, even though Id never been a part of a box. After I graduated (Cum Laude TYVM) I got a corporate job and refrained from exercise for almost a year. I went from a lean 6'2 180, to 215lbs. I had no access to my universities gym and I was not going to pay for a globe gym membership.

Last week I finished my Crossfit 101 class at my first box. Understanding the importance of instruction, I was not going to show up on my first day and tell the coach that I've been doing this for 13 years now, and I don't need the instruction. Instead, I kept my mouth shut and paid strict attention to the basic of exercises I had grown accustomed to all those years.

Time and again, the coach would marvel at about how I was picking up the movements faster than any other person in 101. I guess, I had been doing it right all along with some stuff. What a journey I have seen Crossfit take."	t5_2qqfd	True

When I started, I weighed about 212 lb. I'm 6'1"".  Now, in four months, I've lost 10 pounds.  Wife is going too, and she's a little older than me. She is a trooper!

We go three times a week and have only missed one day.  I kind of set a goal towards being able to complete Rx's at the ladies weight level, which I think is fairly ambitious.

Today I hit it, with a 25# plate, in 29:18.

Complete three rounds for time of:

Run 200m with weight plate (35/25#)
15 ground to overhead with weight plate (35/25#)
Run 200m with weight plate (35/25#)
15 weight plate sit-ups (35/25#)
Run 200m with weight plate (35/25#)
15 squats with weight plate (35/25#)

The running was the hardest part.

After having 4 babies and not working out at all within those 6 years, I was really unhealthy and really unhappy. So March of 2012 I started a CrossFit beginners class. Went from not being able to run a 400m to being able to run 2 miles no problem. I am amazed everyday at what I am capable of and how much my body is changing. Needless to say, I am addicted to CrossFit. Also did the Paleo Challenge with our box from September to November (7 weeks) and lost a whopping 17 lbs. I was stoked!

Sorry for writing so much.. but you can tell I am passionate about this! Thanks for looking!

As weightlifters, or those that use weightlifting movements in training, squat deep, and worry more about lifting more weight than about how defined our arms are (I would guess this describes most on this board)… what did we used to complain about?

1. No place to train with bumpers and chalk.
2. Getting hassled about dropping weight
3. “Trainers” at the local globo gym telling us squatting deep was gonna ruin our knees.
4. Girlfriends not wanting to squat because she is afraid she will get “bulky” 
5. For the competitive weightlifters among us, getting asked “how much ya bench?” after telling someone you are a weightlifter.
6. Trying to explain what a snatch is to someone, usually ending with a pantomime then the words “you know, like they do in the Olympics”
7. If you ever tell someone, hey you should try it its fun, being told “oh no, I could never do that”
8. Being surrounded in any gym by folks that think eating red meat or fat is the enemy of good health or a good looking body.
9. Curls in the squat rack. 
10. Pink dumbells.

So with Crossfit you get…

1. 2000 + more gyms around the country with bumpers and chalk.
2. Most Crossfitters would think you were weird if you DIDN’T drop weights.
3. They may debate where to put the bar on their backs, but they all squat deep.
4. Crossfit girls squat heavy and are proud of getting a rounder butt from it.
5. Most Crossfitters don’t bench press, they might ask you how much you squat instead.
6. Most Crossfitter’s snatch, those that dont certainly know what it is.
7. Crossfit is filled with people people who not only want to try new things, but are willing to work hard to learn and won’t be put off by falling on their butt a few times.
8. Crossfitters, as a whole seem to be proud that they not only eat meat, but are able to eat GOOD (meaning eat a LOT) and still look good because they train so hard. A couple cookouts at Crossfit boxes remain the only two times I have seen women bragging about how many ribs they ate. And not fatties. Young, in shape women.
9. Crossfitters are the ones who will make fun of YOU, if YOU do curls in the squat rack. 
10. Crossfitters only use pink kettlebells.

Are their assholes in CF? I am sure their are, but off the top of my head I can’t think of many that I have met, and, there are certainly assholes in the weightlifting community also.

Are their elitists in CF? Yes, there are. But what is a common criticism of the weightlifting community? That we are elitist. And just like in CF, yeah, there are elitists among us. I don’t think its the norm, but they are there.

The fact that CF has exposed quite literally hundreds of thousands of people to weightlifting aside, do you know what I most like about Crossfit?

They appreciate what we do. I quite often find myself in front of a group of crossfitters with someone like Donny, or Jon, or Caleb demonstrating a heavy snatch or clean and jerk. And you know what, these people appreciate what they are seeing. They appreciate what it took to accomplish it, the work, the years of work, the athleticism, the strength and power. The years of pain, the sacrifice. And for these lifters, there is finally a community, a rather large one, that appreciates what they do, that admires them for it. And that is a beautiful thing. Especially when the average person watching someone do a 140kg snatch has about the same ability to appreciate it as someone who doesnt know how to play chess does to appreciate what they are seeing if they watched a Bobby Fisher chess game.

Weightlifting finally has a fan base. And it’s growing. And that is gonna open up all sorts of new opportunities for the sport.

I will leave you with one last thought. Donny Shankle has been able to drop most of his personal training clients, while finally getting the access to chiropractic, massage, etc, that was always financially tough to get when he needed it. Why is he able to work much less, rest and train more, and still financially swing all those little things that help him?

To a large extent, its been Crossfitters. Now I don’t want to ignore others who have helped, and even donated. But it’s the Crossfit boxes that are holding fund raisers for him, its the Crossfit websites that are encouraging their members to go to his blog and hit the donate button that are the most active in raising money. 

You can certainly find the bad in anything. But I prefer to say the glass is half full. In this instance, maybe even 3/4 full.

Up front I will tell you my lifts: deadlift 610, squat 505, bench 365. 5'9"" 202lbs. I played hockey for almost 20 years so I'm not a fat powerlifter. I can hold my own in the lungs too. Ok here goes: first and foremost is the price. It is outrageously expensive to join a Crossfit ""box."" The gym I go to costs me $20 a month, has three full cages, one open cage, two deadlift platforms, bumper plates, and a whole host of other things that are too long to list. It seems as though you attach the word Crossfit to a gym and suddenly they can charge 10x what it is worth. While we're on the subject: its a gym, not a box. I understand why you think that is clever, but a garage is no more a box than it is a gym when filled with equipment. More on price: accessories. I see people with high socks for no reason, flashy outfits for no reason, Reebok branded Crossfit tank tops or possibly some other Crossfit gym with some catchy slogan on it they visited once. These things scream ""LOOK AT ME!"" I won't get into the whole injury thing because the more people doing something the more injuries you'll see. What I WILL talk about is inept trainers telling their clients to do dangerous things. I've heard countless people say ""well my trainer is different!"" well how do you REALLY know that? Have you talked to some one much stronger than your trainer with more experience and compared their methods or advice? I bet not.

What I do like about Crossfit: It got a mass of people out from their sedentary lifestyles. Thats a great thing. But do you ever step back and think it kind of feels like a cult? It sure looks like that from an outside observer. I've been lifting for over 10 years now and seeing all the new kids coming into the gym trying a WOD or hopping from station to station is flat out annoying. They use multiple sets of equipment at once without any regard as to who else may need it. That may not be the majority of people, but for the amount that everyone reads about Crossfit all over the web I've never seen a warning saying ""don't do this at a gym not set up for it.""

Caseylicious	100	15	56	"Ever since the coach posted his [complaints about the simple act of doing his job](http://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/o9qna/confessions_of_a_crossfit_coach/), I've wanted to use it as a great example of why I don't care for the majority of crossfit boxes. 

Before I get into it, I want to make sure folks understand, that I really enjoy crossfit. I'm not the cultfit type of guy, I do value this community and my intentions are improving it, not making it worse. I intend to keep this constructive, but I'll get bored if it doesn't have some teeth, so please work with me and let's make this into a constructive discussion about something we all love. 

I just went down his bullet points and kind of turned them into general points for trainers and customers to evaluate. I want to remind everyone that although the crossfit level 1 certification is not easy, it also does not necessarily mean that they will all be good at coaching. The attitude of the trainer says a lot. I mostly just learn from my level 1 coach and the crossfit journal, so let me know if I've said anything terribly wrong. I'm not speaking from authority, just from experience up to this point. Some of the guys points were valid, but a lot were things the trainer should be able to fix, or help fix, and venting about them does almost no good at all. 

* If you can't deal with people complaining about your music selection, you probably don't have the mental discipline to be a good trainer.  

* If some one is cheating on reps, point it out to them. They aren't paying you to coddle their ego, if they are, you're probably being a bad trainer. 
 
* Getting there late/leaving early is something that has to happen from time to time. If some one is really messing the class up with the frequency, deal with them one on one. They are, after all, paying you.

* If you are complaining about some simple nutrition questions it makes me think you are too much of a bitch to be worth paying to train me. You're the elite 1000 dollar spending motherfucker, not me. If I can google all your shit, you don't need to be there. 

* Going RX is a goal, if we aren't ready for it, you should have a relationship with us that allows you to tell us that. 

* If the main goal some one has is getting abs, then maybe you've done a bad job of explaining how crossfit works.

* If you're going to critique peoples nutrition, you should be ready to answer their questions. I agree with the beer and comfort foods part, but if they want to know what is and isn't paleo, you should already be getting past that. 

* Yeah, students should listen, if they don't, they're wasting their own money. You should be able to illustrate this point easily while coaching. 

* If you have a person in your gym who is a level 1 and their class mates feel more comfortable asking them a question than the trainer they pay, then you're likely a shitty trainer.  

* If your trainer has been doing crossfit for 7 years and types up a ragey post, they're probably jaded because they're not doing well, the crux of their problem can likely be seen in their frequent use of ""I don't care"". 

* If you are sick or have the flue or whatever, don't let people guilt you into being ostracized and chastised. Try to avoid spreading the illness, but don't neglect yourself because other people are selfish and think they can some how avoid colds and the flu magically.

* The price of a coach is rarely a consistent measuring stick for their skill. If they don't answer nutrition questions, they're a shitty coach imo. 

* Females lifting heavy is good. Heavy is relative based on the person. You will not look like one of those super muscular chicks without trying to. It's not a natural look and requires a lot of non functional fitness. ""Fitness models"" and female body builders will likely not be able to keep up with most CF athletes in metcons and such, they're specialists. 

* Guys, form is really important, but increasing the load is too. You should be working on better and better form, and increased weight as you progress. If your form is bad enough that you need to drop weight, your coach should be able to let you know. 

* ""Learn gymnastic movements. Free standing handstands, L-sits, ring work. It will make you a better athlete."" I agree with this statement. Skill work is tough but it makes everything better, but it is work to develop the skills. If your coach never does any of these, they probably suck. 

* If a coach has you doing kipping stuff all the time without ever having you do the movements in a ""strict"" fashion, you're probably building a weak spot. 

* The success of members is shared with their trainers. Honesty and a good relationship will foster better skills for both of them. If you resent a customer, make sure they end up understanding why. ""Work hard, you will have good days and bad days, but don't give up."" is an entirely valid point, a good coach helps you not repeat those bad days as often. 

**TL;DR** Good coaches probably wouldn't have posted a list like that, demand more from them, they shouldn't be able to preface this many things with ""I don't care if..."" if they're legitimately invested in working with you.

In the year, we have both become close with the members, especially those who have stuck around as long as we have.  We are both graduate students without much money, and with the holidays and trying to save money, we decided we would have to take a couple months off.  Our Crossfit family was actually more bummed than we were.  Our coach offerered us a deal to come Crossfit 3 times a week if we simply clean the box twice a week (takes about an hour each time).

i started my weight loss journey 3 years ago. as soon as i graduated high school i decided to make a change, and get in shape and take control my life and decisions, and gain confidence. i owe it all to my ex girlfriend that cheated on me haha. i was crushed and gained so much weight because i turned to food for comfort. back then i thought if i lost weight she'd want me back, so i started by cutting out sugared drinks and fast food. then i started working out a little bit, (elliptical, and biking. (running hurt too much) and lifting weights) i then started eating more vegetables, and cutting out all processed carbs.


i really started to see a change, when i added healthy foods to my diet. its been a VERY long 3 year journey, and i still have some more work to do. this journey will never end, cause once i hit my goals, then starts the maintaing phase, and that lasts forever.

 i went from being a depressed, 250lb blob that had no job, and didnt do much, to being a very happy, strong, and confident person. i was on my way to being the best me i could.  

i did not like who i was a few years ago. compared to the past couple years, i have changed my life drastically and i owe it all to crossfit. i know theres a lot of people that aren't fans of crossfit, but it saved my life. i am now a certified crossfit trainer, and i'm going for an olympic weightlifting certification this weekend! i have never been this happy in life and crossfit has been a HUGE part of that. i have been training for almost a year and i love every minute of it!

life has never been better, deciding to have a healthier life style and to eat paleo are by far the best things i have ever done in my life.

here are a few pics of my progress and 2 videos!

This is my story, don't know if you care but I want to tell it. 

I wandered into my local box two years ago - I was determined but afraid. When I was in college I took classes full time and worked full time, the ""Freshman Fifteen"" quickly became Twenty in my sophomore year, and  Thirty Five by the time I graduated. It was another two and a half years after college before I decided to change my life - and I've never been happier.

I quit smoking, started dieting, and joined one of those big national franchise gyms for $10 a month - It didn't take me long to realize I had no idea what I was doing and that the people who worked there couldn't be bothered to care or help me. 

After driving by my local box every day for a month I went in for their free intro class - up until that point I had never worked so hard in my life, I vomited in the parking lot when it was over. 

I was fat, inflexible, and weak. 

I've lost most of that weight, and gained more muscle then I ever thought I'd have. I'm working out with weights I never thought I'd be able to – and I have never felt better. I know there are some things that I could be doing better, but I'm trying – always will.

1371085723.0	1g8jpv	Today I bested my previous mile time (5:11) by 7 seconds. I set that time while training to be a collegiate sprinter about 6 years ago... CrossFit works.	DontCallMeBenji	88	12	32	"A little back story: I have/had been a runner for about half my life (I'm 26). I did cross country and track in high school specializing in the 800m. I think my fastest 800m was 2:02. I was probably capable of a pretty decent mile. I was also 40lbs lighter.

Fast forward a bit to my sophomore year of college, I decided to walk on to the track team and sprint (too heavy for distance). Needles to say the previous year I was out of shape and had trained pretty hard to get back into the shape I was in. A 5:11 mile isn't blistering fast by any means, but the point is I was doing running specific training. 

Fast forward again about 6 years to present day. I have been doing CrossFit for about 2.5-3 months. I have not done any running other than what is prescribed in the WOD. 6-8 months before CrossFit I was only lifting due to a chronic hip injury from running. I'm 5'11"" and ~190lbs. For me to be able to run a 5:04 mile with no running specific training is insane.

I don't mean to brag. I just want people to know that this stuff works when done properly. On top of that it transfers over to other types of training, in my case running. I'm really curious now to see what I could run a 400m in. "	t5_2qqfd	True

1365001865.0	1blaa7	I need to brag	Sdr4wkcab	89	16	19	"I started crossfit in Sept of last year. I have just started to be able to occasionally do some wods rx, although I still can't do a pull up and I am still really slow on a lot of other body wieght movements.   
Today's WOD was:  
* 1000m row  
* 30 snatchs @ 75# (I am a girl, so that's the girls weight)  
* 1000m row  
During the open 13.1 wod I got 15 snatches at 75 before I ran out of time, so I knew I could do 75# snatches.
Well I went for it, which means I Rx'ed the WOD (still a really big deal for me). This also meant I was one of the last ones to finish, 75# got really heavy at the end.  
But this is the other exiting part: during the last 250m of the row, I was the only one rowing, sped up as much as I could so I could finish as quickly as possible. One of the newer crossfitter was watching me and I heard her go ""wow, she's a machine!""   
That made me feel so proud. I remember when I was just starting and I would watch others rx the wod or power through the stuff I was struggling with. And now I am one of those people that impresses others at my box!!   
Sorry this was so long but I needed to gloat to someone who would maybe understand. :)

1364363608.0	1b3h8e	A happy CrossFit memory: How I got my Level 1 cert through an amazing coincidence 	crazyxgerman	71	2	7	"Another reddit thread just reminded me of something that happened to me several years ago when I first got into CF. I thought I'd share this story here as well as it is a pretty amazing story and a very happy CF memory of mine:

My wife and I were visiting Tucson back in July 2007. While we drove back to Phoenix to catch a flight back home to CA we talked about various stuff, and i mentioned that one of things I'd like to do is get my Level 1 CrossFit certification. I had discovered CF earlier that year and really got into it, and wanted to be able to share it. However, the cert is expensive and booked for many months in advance, so it was pretty much a pipe dream at the time.

We got to the Phoenix airport, returned the car, checked in, and looked for a place to grab some lunch before our flight. I happened to be wearing my only CrossFit T-shirt at the time.

Suddenly a woman walks up to me, sticks out her hand and says ""Hi, I'm Lauren Glassman. Me and my husband (Coach Glassman, founders of CF) were sitting here eating lunch, saw your shirt, and just wanted to say hi.""

Turns out they were on their way to Santa Cruz, CA (less than an hour from where I lived at the time) to hold a Level 1 CF cert the next two days. We had a nice chat, and Coach ended up inviting me to come to the cert the next day, no charge!!! |8'O

Needless to say, I was so there. I had an [awesome, exhausting, fun weekend](http://stories.byronland.com/crossfit0707_1_en.html) and two days later I had my Level 1 cert.

What made it even more special was that it was at the original CF gym in SC and many of the original guys and gals in the videos were there (Nicole, Annie, Brandon...)

I will never forget this, and I'm forever grateful to Coach and Lauren for giving me this experience. I've been CF'ing for over 6 years now, am in the best shape of my life at 43, have shared it with many people, and made many new friends because of it.

TL;DR: Less than an hour after wishing for something very specific, I was in the right place at the right time wearing the right T-shirt, and it came true in a most unexpected way."	t5_2qqfd	True

At first I was in it only for the Oly Lifting but I would walk over straight from school and watch the crossfit classes before doing my thing and you guys rock. I always saw people helping each other, cheering each other on, taking friendly digs at each other, and just being all around good people.

This made me want to start doing crossfit so I signed up for my box's Intensive Elements course. Now, I'm really really overweight but I'm in pretty good health so I figured it was worth a shot if I could just get myself to go. 

I have severe social anxiety and I was freaking out for literally two weeks before my IE course started. As it got closer and closer I got more and more worried and when I showed up I was a wreck. When I saw who was in IE with me, I really freaked out. 

There was me and one other girl and every guy was either a college athlete, a bodybuilder, a personal trainer, ex-military, or some combination thereof. I had two panic attacks in the first hour and a half class and ended up running out of the gym to find my car and just go home.

As I was paying for my parking a few blocks away, one of the ex-military/current personal trainer buff, scary, awesome dudes in my IE class came and found me. He told me that he was really proud of me for doing something out of my comfort zone and he told me that he was rooting for me and if I ever needed help I could ask him. He also told me he hoped I came back the rest of the days and finished the course.

I was floored. I got in my car and cried because I'm so used to being ostracized for my weight. I ended up going back and rocking the next few days because they weren't box jumps and pull ups, they were squats and rowing and things I was good at. 

Anyway, I just wanted to thank you all for being so accepting and for being an incredible community. My box is my home away from home and I wouldn't have it any other way.

Those limits vary for people, when someone says they were able to set a PR for 115 lbs Front Squat I see PR I don't see 115 lbs. This sub should have an unprecedented amount of upvotes (think of them like pounding a gym mate after a tough WOD). Instead I hear criticism and snarky back handed compliments. My box doesn't operate that way, #1 Rule in my box : First Done is the First One Chearing. So whats with the hate people? 	t5_2qqfd	True

For time:

* 59 Wall Balls

then 3 rounds of the following

* 12 Squat Cleans (135#/95#)
* 18 Pull-ups
* 23 Box Jumps

then

* 1 Clean (165#/115#)
* Buddy Carry 100m

Here is the significance of each rep:

* 59 = wounded in battle
* 3 rounds = March
* 12 = 1st Bn 2nd Marines
* 18 = killed in Action
* 23 = day in March
* 1 Clean = a moment in combat when I had drug a wounded Marine to safety, and with his legs shot to shit I tried to pick him up to shoulder carry him and I was unable to complete the task. It is still my motivation behind every CrossFit workout I do, and what I think about when I think I might stop or skip a workout. (With the help of another Marine we did drag him to safety and he is alive and well.)
* Buddy Carry 100m = the fire carry that I was unable to accomplish.
100m was about the distance I needed to carry him to get him into the house where we would set up a defensive position.

They can be broken up throughout the day. 
If you miss a day, you have to make them up the next day. If you miss two days, then you're out. 
You can work ahead one day. Example, you know you are going to be busy on Thanksgiving Day stuffing your face so you can do all the burpees for that day, the day before, on Nov 21st.

Well, the haters can suck it, because I just joined the 0 lbs squat club!

I broke my ankle playing rugby at the beginning of the year, which meant surgery, plates, screws, splints, air boots, crutches and not a lot of CrossFit.

I've been ""walking"" (read: limping) for a little while though and my physical therapist just assigned me squats.  No bar, no plates, just air-squatting.

It hurt like bloody hell (I'm really tight in my bad leg), but I finally banged out my 30 air squats in two sets of 15.

It'll be a while before I can put a bar on my back, and then a while longer before I get over 300 again, but I'll make it back.  When I do, I'll be proud of myself too. =)

I'm currently trying to validate a business idea I had and I wanted to get your thoughts and opinions on it. This would specifically target the crossfit/paleo community and people serious about their fitness.

As a crossfit enthusiast with a full time job I find it hard to commit the time to properly eating paleo for every meal. To get around this, I usually pre-package and prepare my food in advance for the week. I want to offer this same service to people all over the country.

The business would be called Competition Ready Meals.
A meals-delivered-to-your-door service for a Paleo lifestyle. We would specifically focus on people who are serious about their fitness and are committed to achieving their goals. Hence, the name ""Competition Ready""

We send you a weeks supply of food (4 meals a day) with pre made paleo food that all you need to do microwave it or put it in the oven. The food would be frozen and all you do is unfreeze and eat. 

This targets the ever growing niche of healthy eaters, also limited time people, also the paleo trend. The point of contact would be through our website, direct marketing, and strategic partnerships with gyms, crossfit boxes and other exercise establishments. 

The eventual goal is to have different plans for weight loss, weight gain, and custom goals.

Made with grass fed, no growth hormone meats, completely measurable down to calories and nutritional macros. Perfect for the busy control freak who takes their diet and fitness seriously. 

We would partner with a nutritionist and a world renowned fitness guru.

""The athletes have access to the best trainers and nutritionists. Why can't you?""

**tldr: Would you be interested in a service that delivered Paleo meals to your door weekly (food for the week)? No thought required, just eat.** 

Thanks! Looking forward to your opinion guys!

I just attended my first training session Wednesday morning, and though my quads and glutes hate me with a passion and stairs are a major issue two days later, I can't wait to head back for my next dose! After learning some of the basics, the trainer put me through a modified Fran- substituting ring rows for pullups. I used embarrassingly low weights on the thrusters and it took me almost 13 min, but I finished every rep in attempted good form.

I got my first pair of VFF KomodoSports three Saturdays ago. To make a long story short, after going rafting in the aftermath of TS Irene, I forgot to put my shoes up out of reach of my stupid dog. He thought the combination of sweat stench and river water was irresistable for some reason and decided the best course of action was the chew the pull-loop on the back of the shoe and the heel off the insole. He's killed $400 worth of shoes in the past month, so I was pissed, needless to say. 

Anyhow, here's the point. I called Vibram customer service, hoping I could buy a new set of insoles because the rest of the shoe was fine. Turns out, they don't sell or even provide replacement insoles. I thought I was screwed. 

Instead, the customer service rep told me to send him an email with the particulars, size, color, style etc and he would try to find me a pair of returned shoes that can't be resold that would normally be used as salesman's samples. That was last Wednesday. Yesterday, I arrived home to find a brand new pair of VFFs sitting on my doorstep along with [one of these](http://www.amazon.com/Vibram-K9-Frisbee-Disc-Raspberry/dp/B002V17UT0) addressed to ""The Dog of graffiti81"".

My big issue with Crossfit is Crossfit HQ, Crossfit.com WODs and the games. 

Put more bluntly, find me a person who is competing in the games based solely on crossfit.com WODs. You can’t and won’t. 

Why? Because crossfit.com WODs are just terrible programming. Most people know this and see the issue and most crossfit affiliates will do their own programming because of this. But this sends a terrible message. First because this is how Crossfit started and most people who have issues with Crossfit cite this is their main issue, and they are right. Second this means that there is no such thing as “Crossfit”. I mean, what is crossfit then? You can’t say it is a philosophy b/c cross training existed way before crossfit. You can’t say it is programming, because most people don’t follow .com programming. So, what is it? I guess we are left with community and the games? 

Which leads me to HQ. We all know some of the issues with HQ, and combined with the terrible programming mentioned above, HQ is a HUGE liability to whatever crossfit actually is. Frankly, it’s freakin’ amateur hour over there and it makes whatever “crossfit” is a joke to people who look at it from the outside. Who would want to say “I crossfit” when they might get associated with HQ, their terrible programming and awful reputation? Any reasonably good coach and athlete wouldn’t, or rather, shouldn’t. 

Lastly, the games. I actually love the games. I have no problem with the games themselves. My issue is the conflation of crossfit.com WODs and the people competing in the games. As I said above, no one is competing in the games based on .com programming. And yet, those people are “crossfitters”. Imagine if the the World’s Strongest Man competition also sold a workout program to become the world’s strongest man/woman. Now, imagine if everyone competing there did not use that program but instead opted for another style of programming. Now imagine, worse still, if all knowledgeable people KNEW that the programming sold by strongest man organization was not only not great, but terrible. What kind of message would that send? 

Sorry if this was rambly, but it comes down to .com WODs being bad and no one actually using them to prepare for the games. HQ, IMO, needs to drop the joke wods they have and come up with REAL programming. As it stands, HQ and .com WODs are jokes. It’s the blacksheep of the crossfit world and I wouldn’t want my name associated with it.

After years of my father, brother, engineers, and manufacturers brain storming with my father's original design this is the result.

1374356868.0	1ipt46	Prevent injuries, don't fix them.	Doc_Holidai	43	3	12	"Within the Crossfit community, injuries are pretty common.  Anything from DOMS to patella tracking issues developed over the course of training.  In my profession, I can't be set back by an injury.  On top of normal training, the daily work effort requires a sound body, without which I am ineffective at accomplishing my mission.  
Things I've learned that lifestyle athletes should know-
1.   Warm-Up:
	Dynamic and deliberate.  'm sure everyone has heard that stretching before a workout can be counter-productive.  That doesn't mean don't warm up.  Whether you do Coach Burgeners warm-up or something else, make sure to limber up.  I make sure my warmup does the following: Elevates my heart rate, gets me slightly out of breath, includes body weight versions of exercises i'm doing that day.  Bench press = pushup.  Clean and Jerks = c&amp;j with a pvc pipe or the bar.  Body weight squats.  You get the point.  I also do leg swings(not kicks) forward and sideways, to loosen up the hip abducters before cleans/snatches/squats.

2.  Cool down:
	I have to admit I neglect this way too often.  After pushing myself to my own limit, the last thing I want to do is do a cool down.  I want to shower, eat, sleep.  Then when I wake up the next day my hamstrings LOVE that I didn't stretch.  I recommend a program like starting stretching: http://phraktured.net/starting-stretching.html.  For a run, usually walking off the run is effective for me.  Find your groove.
3. Don't sweat it
	If you aren't feeling well, or are feeling overly fatigued, don't go into the gym.  When you half-assedly attempt a clean and mess up your shoulder, you could spend some serious time playing catch up.  Missing one session isn't going to kill your progress.
4. Sometimes enough is enough
	There is a difference between breaking records and breaking your body.  Know your limits, maintain good form, and don't be afraid to check your ego at the door.  Everybody starts somewhere, and everyone is training with the same thing in mind: improvement.  
5. Drink water!
	I can't stress this enough.  Nothing is worse than feeling gased half way into a good WoD that you normally can kill.  Not being well hydrated BEFORE you get to the gym can make or break a session.
6.  Work your weaknesses
	Do rehabilitation work BEFORE you have an injury.  It seems counter-intuitive, but it will save you pain and setbacks in the future.  For example, I have a weak right shoulder, and my ROM is decreased in it.  Every training session I make sure to work a little bit on shoulder flexibility and strength.  In this case, shoulder dislocates put 20lbs on my snatch as I rehabilitated my weakness.  
7. Injuries I see frequently in my Aid Station
	A. Runners knee-  Prevention is making sure your IT Band stays supple, and you are stretching it or rolling it out.
	B.  Plantar Fasiitis- Prevent it by using a lacrosse ball to roll out the arches of the feet.  Make sure you are running with a shoe that fits your foot, running style, and arch, not a shoe that looks cool or is marketed towards Crossfit.
	C.  Strained rotator cuff/shoulder-  The shoulder is so fragile if you aren't careful.  Ensure that you spend time loosening up your pectoral and shoulder girdle.
	D. Lower back strain-  Stretch that joker by doing a seated forward bend, making sure your knees are slightly bent so that the stretch targets the lower back and not the hamstrings.
	E. Shin splints-  This goes with plantar fasciitis, shoes shoes shoes.  Running with good form is also important.  Crossfit Endurance has good sections about running form.

1350571456.0	11ovnd	Went to first class, totally demoralized.  How to keep going back?	cf12345	45	7	84	"So I went to the first elements class.  I couldn't do a single fucking pushup or a pull up.  Was able to do a few squats, that's pretty much it.  The instructor had to single me out, as I was that bad :(  I was a total failure and was easily the worst in my batch by an order of 10 (or probably 100).

I am not fat, just totally out of shape.  I can hardly walk straight, and already having second thoughts about going back to the second class.  My brain wants to go back (I want to get fit, plus I have paid 300$ already, which is not a small amount) but my body says otherwise.  I've my second class today and I am sitting here like a zombie.

So my questions are:
1. If you are someone like me, totally out of shape, can't do even a single pushup - how did you continue going back?  

2.  Also, after the class, I felt so hungry - I usually eat very less, but I binged out after the class (even though I could barely stand).  What should I eat? Obviously eating pizza or chinese is not a good idea

3.  Is there any way to gradually learn to do pushups?



UPDATE:
I went back to the second class.  I sucked supremely, but I am happy I went back.  I am going to stick to it, and going to read up on all the movements and watch videos etc this weekend.  My first goal is to get my form right.

If you think about it, having to carry the weight removes your inability to swing your arms. According this article, running with a 16kg (~35lbs) kettle bell is realistically feeling more like 26kg (~57lbs). Doing the same workout with a weighted vest would be as difficult."	t5_2qqfd	True

I never was into Sports or exercising before. Sticking to something, anything, was hard for me. That's why I'm surprised that I have been consistently doing Crossfit 3 times a week for 3 months now and I love every second. I can't imagine quitting. Never think about it or want to.

As far as progress, I've slowly been noticing some progress on how much weight I can lift or push ups I can do. It's funny how my expectations were so crazy in the beginning though. I thought by now I would have a 6 pack an be doing pull ups. I did lose 14 pounds and have a little muscle on my arms, but that doesn't matter to me. My goal now is to focus on the small things.Just being able to do KB swings with 20lbs kbs when 3 months ago I could only do 10lbs, or being able to do at least 5 non modified push ups when I couldn't even do 2, is a big deal. Not to mention other achievements such as being able to run a 5k only 2 months into Crossfit, when before that I never could run in for 1 minute.

People have been noticing my energy and my love for Crossfit, as well as the difference it made on my body, and 2 people from my work joined my box this month. For the first time in my life, I inspired people to do something like this.

Starting Crossfit it's one of the best decisions I have made in my life. Its a lifestyle and long term change and something I never want to stop doing.

I know that's ridiculously cheap, and he's not a full time crossfit guy, he just does it for a little extra cash. He's lucky in that he has a facility to use that he doesn't have to pay for so he can keep his cost low. However, I've seen these gyms that charge anywhere from 90-250 a month for unlimited workouts. Why is it so expensive? From what I can tell, to set one of these gyms up would be cheap compared to the cost of setting up a full gym with all the equipment. Why can't these gyms charge what a normal gym would, or maybe a little more i.e. 60 -80 a month for unlimited use, instead of their prices? Is there a logistical reason or are they just charging that much because people will pay it?

Edit* I'm guess I'm really asking if they do need to charge that much to make a profit due to over costs, or if they're just making a lot of money at it."	t5_2qqfd	True

It would take me more time, effort, and focus to program this badly, than it would to put together something comprehensive and encompassing. 8 out of 10 movements in a worldwide competition are overhead, without a single pulling strength component. Now the final WOD is an unoriginal repeat of last year, which is compounded by being an unoriginal repeat of WOD 4!! Think about it...after 150 wallballs, we're now looking at 60+ ""heavy"" wallballs. And after testing MU's, we're now testing MU's again on a bar just without the tricep extension.

1359075205.0	17854d	Leaving Crossfit in favor of Starting Strength	egoviri	38	4	62	"Let me start by saying - I **love** crossfit.  6 months ago, I started out as a 210lb, 30% bodyfat 29 year old.  I'm an ER doctor, and to be honest, residency was not kind to me.  I went from an athletic, 165 pound swimmer in high school to a 210 lb elevator-taking monstrosity a few months ago.  I was only able to do 2-3 pullups at the beginning of crossfit before switching to green bands.

Crossfit has done wonders for me.  In conjunction with strict paleo, I've lost 35 pounds and gained significant conditioning.  I can easily do 15 strict chin-ups and WODs have gotten... less awful.  Not easy, but not as terrible as they once were.  I still cannot Rx a single WOD, although my ego learned to deal with that a long time ago.  

What I've started realizing is that I'm not making the conditioning gains that I believe I could with a careful, individualized plan.

There is a significant strength component to crossfit that I simply don't have.  My current deadlift sits at 215 lb, which is only 40lb over BW.  That has improved only slowly despite religious attendance and diet.

And so, I'm embarking on a small journey.  I'm going to put my membership with my box on hiatus (breaks my heart, those guys are awesome) and really commit to Starting Strength for a couple of months.   Once I hit a 2X BW deadlift and a 1.5X BW bench, I'll be back to crossfit.

I started Crossfit back in October of 2011.  I recently moved and had to switch boxes and was a little worried because my old box had an awesome group of people.  At my first 6am class at the new box I was approached by three different individuals and made new friends.  I feel just as welcomed at the new place and am so glad I have had a positive experience thus far.  All of my trainers have all been educated and are well-known in all different parts of the country.  I have been paid close attention to, have made progress, new friends, confidence and lost three pant sizes.  I'm taking gender stereotyping, throwing it out the window and owning deadlifts!  It's finally something that I love doing and feel very passionate about.

Not every Crossfitter is a jerk, but there ARE people out there who are jerks.  And, unfortunately, there ARE boxes out there run by careless, possibly uneducated trainers.  Please do your research when looking for a box in your area!  Before you create this negative viewpoint in your mind based on hearsay or one individual you've met, know that there is at least 5 other people out there who have had significant amounts of progress doing Crossfit.  Sure, people may not think it's as good as THEIR way, but isn't that the case with most things in the world that aren't even fitness related?  Everyone wants to think their children are the smartest, their dogs are the best behaved, their cooking is the most delicious.  The reality is that as long as you're out there, doing your thing and taking care of your body while being conscientious of others then that is all that matters."	t5_2qqfd	True

The first time I did the wod I went balls to the wall and by the end of the second set I could barely breathe. I was too amped and a rebounded every box jump at max pace. Most of you will have seen my post Wednesday night after I did the wod


I tried it again yesterday and did 1:20 second splits for each round. That also left my some wiggle room at the end if I got too gassed or had more in the tank. Quite a few people in the box were saying wtf when they saw the slow and steady pace of my stepped up box jumps on the first round but the difference was I was able to do the whole wod without having to stop. I heavily advise pacing and time splits for these workouts. Unless you're elite balls to the wall will not yield the best result!

This was by far the most annoying part about losing weight and getting stronger, the obviously uneducated members of my family/friends who felt the need to talk down to me for making a lifestyle choice.

At Thanksgiving dinner I was lectured on getting away from ""that cult"" because I'd end up with blueberries for testicles and lose my personality and be nursing a ""torn scrotum by Spring!"". Fat uncle is pissed at the world for not keeping him thin and spry while he sucks down his diet cokes and vanilla long johns.

Our ""coach"" for the intro class gave us three simple tasks: 

*  200 meter run
*  15 wall balls
*  10 burpees
*  repeat x3 for time

It went great for the first round. I had to limp my way through the second and third and had I eaten anything before going to class, I would have lost it. 

This is completely unlike anything I've ever done in my life. It's fun and it really made me realize how much work it takes to be in good shape. Fuck. I felt like I was going to die at the end. Needless to say I was third from last in the class to finish. At 5'4"" 165 (male for those who are wondering) that charges up my competitiveness.

1375024697.0	1j7uru	List of competitors who can still mathematically win in their category	coughytalk	34	5	1	"In [another thread](http://redd.it/1j7mpk) /u/fatdaz asked if Josh Bridges could still win. He's way back point wise behind Froning but he is not mathematically eliminated even though it is very unlikely that he would be able to pass everyone in front of him. So I went ahead and figured out who *technically* could still win as of the beginning of Sunday's events. This of course requires the leader to lose the rest of their events and everyone else above them to totally tank. This is unlikely of course but from a theoretical perspective, the list of competitors below are still viable.

There are two assumptions. First, no DQ's. Even the last place athlete could still win if everyone else is DQ'ed for some reason so let's just eliminate that as a factor. Second, there will be a single final event worth 100 points. If the finals end up being a double event or something that would mean more points are on the table and would change everything. Those are the two assumptions.

**Men who could still win**  
Froning currently has 662. If he came in last in the next two events he would get 13 points for the morning WOD and 27 points for the evening WOD for a total of 702. The following men have more than 502 points currently and could pass Froning if they won the next two events:

Jason Khalipa  
Garret Fisher  
Ben Smith  
Marcus Hendren  
Josh Bridges  
Scott Panchik  

**Women who could still win**  
Despite a larger relatively lead by Briggs, more women are within striking distance of her. She has 672 right now and would net 713 if she placed last in the next two events. The following women could catch her if they placed first in the next two events:

Alessandra Pichelli  
Valerie Voboril  
Christy Phillips  
Anna Tunnicliffe  
Lindsey Valenzuela  
Jenn Jones  
Talayna Fortunato  
Kara Webb  

**Teams who could still win**  
Hack's Pack UTE has a nearly 100 point lead over CrossFit New England and they in turn are about 50 points up on Dallas Central. Not surprisingly it's a pretty grim prognosis for anyone trying to catch Hack's Pack UTE who can only be caught by CFNE. Even if they came in dead last in the next two events nobody besides CFNE could pass their 643 points they'd get from the next two events. The minimum score for Hack's is aided by the fact that only 20 teams advance to the final WOD so they would get 47 points for their final event even coming in last.

CrossFit New England

tl;dr The current leaders are highly favored to win with Khalipa being the only competitor who even has a reasonable chance to surpass the leader.

When I do them, I sit all the way down to a dead stop, then power up. 185 was just fail after fail, I couldn't even stabilize it at the very bottom, it would just fall forward.

I took a couple of weeks off any sort of squatting, because my knees were a bit sore. This week I tried OHS on monday and hit a 30lb PR at 205lbs. Tried again thursday and got 215 pretty easily, but I had to stop early because people were crowded around me for a WOD. I tried them again today and got 225. Failed the first attempt, nailed the 2nd, and it felt perfectly comfortable sitting at the bottom, the only struggle was standing back up. 

Anyways, I'm just pretty stoked and wanted to share this. 50lb PR in one week! It was nuts. It's pretty crazy how fast your stability in the overhead squat will go up."	t5_2qqfd	True

I was hardly eating and getting to be in pretty bad physical shape. I decided to quit the gaming, and start up at my local crossfit box. Everyone there was very friendly, the trainers were great.

Everything felt heavy, I managed 1 pull up, couldn't do a ring dip. My flexibility was terrible, I had to pull deadlifts off some bumper plates, because I am tall, and couldn't deadlift from the floor with proper form. 

I wasn't really great for keeping my stats, but starting off my backsquat was 175 lbs, deadlift was 240, push press 115 I think. Box jump around 36inches.

I started eating a lot, gained about 20lbs in the first 3-4 months. Got my first muscle ups, got a 60inch box jump with a step into it, improved my sprint around the block (400+ meters) to the fastest in the gym. 

* Now my backsquat is around 300lbs
* Deadlift is 405+, haven't tested it in a while.
* Push press- 205+
* Clean and jerk - 225
* Snatch- 165 (Just recently started really working on this)
* Muscle ups are no problem, haven't really tested them in a while. I usually do them strict. 

I'm focusing mainly on strength and Olympic lifts right now. 

Overall it has been a great experience, and I've learned a TON about fitness. Can't wait to go back and train tomorrow!

The warm up wears me out, and I haven't finished a WOD yet.

On thursday We did box jumps and kb swings 21-15-9.  I did the girls weight on the kettle bells and 20 inches or so on the box jumps.  I ended up doing box steps instead of jumps, having terrible form on the kb swings and still taking around 15 min (the next worse time was 8:45).

Monday was 3 power cleans and 400 mm runs, 7 rounds for time. I did 1 run where i walked half the way and barely finished the cleans. 2 rounds of 7.

Yesterday was Fran. I got through the first round in 10 minutes. and then finished the thrusters on the second round and like 4 assisted pull ups.

Am I too out of shape for Crossfit?


Edit: thanks for the words of encouragement. It just sucks to be the worst one at the gym. I'm going to stick with it. 2 weeks of  paleo and I'm quitting alcohol for a month, I'm serious about getting in shape.  It's just disheartening. "	t5_2qqfd	True
1374517985.0	1ittq2	Two weeks of Crossfit: Still fat, but getting motivated.	JoeDaddio	33	5	13	"I don't have a blog or anything, but since my coaches say it's good to journal about my crossfit experiences/lifts/etc. (and I've not done anything of the sort since I started) I figured I'd make a post here, if only to get some things out.

Obviously, being only two weeks in, I am not going to see much of a difference. I started on the 2x/week plan but will probably move up to 3x/week fairly soon. There's a competition coming up that runs five weeks that also gives you an extra day pass per week that costs $45 (a single day pass is like $20 itself) so I may sign up for that, if only to get some extra days for a good price. Two days a week is good, it's showing me where I'm at and not stressing me too much, but I feel that having so many days in between training (I currently go Monday and Wednesday) can be a challenge in itself.

Last Wednesday we were to find out our 1RM for the squat, press, and dead lift. I haven't done these lifts seriously in ages and didn't expect much. 

For the squat I was at 285. I feel like I should have been able to do more (I currently weigh ~315, down from about 340 about three months ago thanks to paleo) for my weight, but I also think I did a bit too much weight with too many reps when I was leading up to the weight.

The press was pathetic... it really went to show me how weak my upper body is. I pressed 125 and could *barely* get that up. I expect to see that number go up even as I drop weight.

My dead lift was pretty motivating, however. I maxed out at 390. I'm pretty sure I could have pulled 400 but I came up on my toes at 390 (squishy running shoes with a fat heel) that made my coach a biit uneasy with that much weight so we stopped it. I was pretty toasted after that, anyways. It felt pretty good because once I got up over 350 or so it got the attention of some other people in the box and they came over to watch and my coach and another guy in my class started moving weight on and off the bar for me. I won't lie... it felt nice to hear people say things like ""if this guy pulls 400 lbs for his first one rep max here I'm gonna kill myself.""

I don't know if I'll be able to sustain that number in the dead lift while I drop weight, but I hope I can keep somewhat near it and maybe work back up to it. Losing weight and being healthy is my number one goal.

People have mentioned to me how expensive Crossfit is. It was the one thing that held me back from getting in to it. It's prohibitive for a lot of people and it's a big turn off. Especially because there's a Fitness 19 a few blocks from my house where I pay $13/month and can go whenever I like.

But the thing that took me this long to understand about myself (I'm 31 years old), the thing that was really hard to admit to myself, is that I simply do not have the will power to do this on my own. While most of the movements I've done in my level one classes can be done in my back yard, I *know* that I will not do them on my own. Ever.

My Crossfit experience is worth it to me for one primary reason: community. There is a community of people who are supportive and fun and nice and welcoming who want to help and encourage me to be the best me I can be.

And maybe one of these days I'll be at a point where I can be motivated enough to do these workouts on my own, but that point is not now. And this is something that I need to do for myself, in order to be at a place in my life where I am healthy.

My life right now is wonderful. Just over three months ago I married a wonderful woman who I love and appreciate and who loves and appreciates me. And we're planning on having kids in the relatively near future (hopefully within a couple of years). I have a good job that I like, live in a nice apartment, have great friends and family. The only thing I could possibly to right now is to improve myself, my health, so that I can enjoy these things for as long as possible. 

I don't want to be an overweight dad. I don't want to sit on the couch while I ell my kids to go outside and play. i want to be that role model that they need. The person they deserve. I don't want to die of a heart attack in my 50's because I never decided to get my ass in gear and take care of myself.

I am worth the money I spend each month to go to Crossfit. My wife and my future kids are worth it. In the long rum it's a small price to pay for the potential I can get out of it.

In other awesome news: my wife just did her first WOD today. She called me afterwards, out of breath, saying that was the hardest things she's done. She also told me how fin it was and how great everyone there was. How people who finished before her were cheering her on.

I'm only two weeks in. Tonight I go to my fifth class (not including my initial trial class). I know it's going to hurt. I know I'm going to walk out a sweaty, sloppy mess. But I know I'm going to like it, and I know I have the support of the people there who I will soon be able to call my friends.

This place has given me actual excitement about working out. The workouts are fun and fast and I get more out of them than I ever have from any traditional gym. I hope to make this part of my life going forward. A hopefully much longer life than I would otherwise have thanks to Crossfit.

Thanks for reading this. it felt good just to get some stream of consciousness writing out about my feelings on what's been going on the past couple weeks."	t5_2qqfd	True

I was wrong.

I have never in my life done high intensity interval training where it was one exercise after another like today.  I normally go at my own pace while at the local gym, rest after a tough set, and then continue. 

So here I am, a decently in-shape individual gasping for air without a dry spot on my entire body while I have both a 47 year old man to my left and a cute, petite girl to my right going beast mode like it was no big deal.

By the end of the hour session I was exhausted, covered in sweat, and bent over on my knees.  But I loved every minute of it.  Everyone was really nice, encouraging, and supportive.  I enjoyed it so much that when I got home I signed up and paid for 12 sessions for the next month.  Even though it is expensive and I'll have to make some changes in my budget, I can't wait to start up.

I look forward to seeing what this community has to say and I hope to learn along the way!

1328547612.0	pdc6e	If you don't think some of CrossFit is cult-like, try switching boxes.	rerational	43	15	54	"First off, I'll start off sharing a bit about my story with CrossFit so far.  It seems like I go in 2-3 year cycles with my fitness.  Since graduating college about 10 years ago I've been in great shape, then been lazy with my fitness. I've put on a few extra lbs, then I hit a point where I'm about 20 lbs heavier than I'd like to be.  I work out, and get back in great shape and repeat.  In 2005 I used the Abs Diet book and just straight gym time on my own to drop 15-20 lbs, then I cruised for a while and put the weight back on.  In 2008, I used P90X and was in great shape for a year, before my wife having a baby and me gaining weight right along with her.  Finally, in late 2011 I reached my extra 20 lbs mark.  A local CrossFit gym opened up in a small strip mall less than a mile from my house.  I set up an intro class. (For the sake of the reader, I'll call this Acme CrossFit.)

I loved it.  Well, I got my ass handed to me, but I really loved it.  I've never done any olympic style lifting before.  I loved the aggression of some of the strength days and the brutality of effort required during some of the MetCon days.   One thing that I loved was the community aspect.  Immediately I was welcomed in, invited out to a few nights at restaurants, parties at the box (that's what they call their gym for you that are uninitiated.) 

In 4-5 months at the local box, I made some great gains.  My strength improved, stamina, agility etc.  The one thing that always bothered me is that Acme didn't have early AM classes.  Now, I'm the father of a toddler.  I work from 7AM-5PM most days.  My daughter sleeps from 7PM to 7AM.  That leaves about 2 hours each day when we're both home and awake.

I had expressed a desire for early AM classes with the owners of my box since before I started.  I was always told ""we'll have them in a month or two when there is interest.""  After 5 months at Acme, that interest never developed.  I was told in no uncertain terms that there would be no early morning classes ""any time soon.""

After that, I looked at another box across town (We'll call it XYZ CrossFit).  They have a full and active group of people showing up to 5:30 and 6:30 am classes.  I went in for a workout and enjoyed the place.  It was a good crowd.  However, I really didn't want to switch boxes.  

This is where the drama starts.  I think my treachery of doing a WOD (Workout of the day) across town at a rival box XYZ was discovered when I wrote my workout I did over there in my progress book at my first box.  Within 2 days, the vibe I got from the owner of ACME was a bit odd.  He was very short and dismissive of me.  I asked questions and got short curt responses.  It was a lot of little things.  I got scowled at and ridiculed for not turning the light off in the bathroom etc.  This went on for a week or two.  I went to a free Yoga class at XYZ and posted about enjoying a Yoga class on facebook.  

The wife of the gym owner at ACME (I guess a co owner as well, but I'm trying not to use names here) commented on my status on facebook asking where I did Yoga at.  (She rarely commented on my status updates on facebook, so I can only assume she knew what the other box was offering since it was all on their public website.)  I replied honestly, that I went to a free Yoga session at XYZ CrossFit.

After that, things got really weird.  I traveled for business, and when I came back to ACME late in the week the gym owner was very short with me when I came in.  I came in the next day for an open gym and was working on some skills and the vibe I got from him was one of contempt and annoyance that I was in his gym. 

I was a bit annoyed.  However I figured it would blow over.  I got home, went to his facebook page to wish him good luck on a competition he was entering.  That's when I discovered  I had been unfriended.  I guess unfriending on facebook is the pinnacle of passive aggressive internet behavior.  I honestly can say I was surprised and shocked.  How can a business owner ""friend"" one of their clients, and then unfriend them and expect that the person would continue to be their customer?  

After 2 or 3 days I sent the female owner at ACME a message saying in effect that I didn't feel really comfortable in their gym and that I was going to take a break from ACME for a while.  (There were a few other incidents, but I don't want to go into that here.)

She replied back a very honest and open reply.  I appreciated it.  She was honest in saying that they were hurt that I was visiting XYZ and liking them on facebook.  We exchanged a couple other replies, and left on what I thought was an understanding of good terms.

After all the preceding paragraphs, we now come to the interesting part that merits the subject line. One trait of a cult is that the leader will encourage members to cut off contact with those on the outside.  Now, I've never said anything negative about ACME to anyone outside of expressing some of the recent frustrations to my wife (and she probably is rolling her eyes not caring).

But, over the last 5 days, no less than 9 members of ACME have ""unfriended"" me on Facebook.  I saw one of these folks in the store yesterday.  We have worked out together, sweat together, exchanged fist bumps and half hugs after tough WODs.  He could barely muster eye contact and a ""'sup?"" as we passed in the grocery store.

I find it so amazing that an organization such as this can take themselves so seriously and also take my leaving so personally as to try to cut off contact with me.  It's just really weird.  This behavior screams cult like ""in group vs out group"" behavior.  

Anyone ever have any similar experiences switching boxes.  I'm amazed at this...really odd.

Most affiliates will often have a free class that you can take part in.  I suggest you do this for each of the prospective affiliates in your area to see which one you feel like fits you best.  If possible, try to arrive early and stay late to watch the coaches interact with members and get a general vibe for the gym.  Everything varies from one to the next.  Choosing a box is a whole different post that I may write because it gets asked a ton around here, but that's not the point of this post.


**Understanding Modality and the basics of a ""Crossfit"" workout (Metcon):**

Before we jump into performing a workout I think it's best to talk about the basics of a crossfit workout and the major movements involved.  Crossfit operates around three modalities: Gymnastics, Metabolic Conditioning and Weightlifting. All covered [here](http://library.crossfit.com/free/pdf/06_03_CF_Template.pdf).

*Gymnastics* (utlizing a loose definition of Gymnastics) includes: Air Squat, Pull-up, Push-up, Dip, Handstand Push-up, Rope Climb, Muscle-Up, Press to Handstand, Back Extension, Sit-up, Jumps and Lunges

*Metabolic Conditioning* includes things like: Running, Biking, Rowing, and Jumping Rope.

*Weightlifting* includes activities like: Weighted Squats, Deadlifts, Cleans, Presses, Snatch, Clean and Jerk, Medicine Ball Drills and Kettlebell Swing

To summarize the Crossfit Journal piece, most of the major workouts you will see in crossfit are a combination of two or three movements across each of these domains.  The workout structure will vary depending on whether the goal/purpose of the workout is to focus on single, double or triple modalities.  See the document for the definition of each purpose (starts on the second to last paragraph of page 3).  This is a very basic approach to the crossfit style program and is how most of the Crossfit HQ website WODs are structured.  One of the major criticisms of crossfit is that the constantly varied nature of these workouts provides no structure to build a consistent strength basis.  The Crossfit Athletes at the games are not doing HQ WODs all day everyday and this is also the reason you are starting to see more and more affiliates adopt structured approaches to strength progression through traditional linear progression models and/or conjugate methods such as [OPT](http://optexperience.com/blog), [Outlaw](http://theoutlawway.com/category/blog/), [Crossfit Football](http://www.crossfitfootball.com/) and [Crossfit Invictus](http://www.crossfitinvictus.com/category/wod/performance/).  There are plenty more, I just can't think of them off the top of my head.

**Onto the doing:**

Just because you don't happen to have an affiliate close to you, or the cost of joining is prohibitive doesn't mean you can't do crossfit.  The easiest way to start, especially for new people is with bodyweight exercises.  Some of my favorite WODs occur when I'm traveling for work through the use of sites like [The Traveling WOD](http://www.thetravelingwod.com/) or these [Bodyweight WODs](http://www.learncrossfit.com/?page_id=98).  Travel WODs will be the easiest because they require the least amount of equipment.  The second thing you can do is find an affiliate near you and follow their programming with either home equipment, or at a standard gym during down times if at all possible. If you're going to do crossfit, I would recommend you don't do it in a standard gym, especially during high traffic times.  You're going to be using multiple pieces of equipment and pissing everyone off around you and just generally looking like a douche.  If you have no choice, stick to something you can do with minimal intrusion on others space and keep your equipment usage to a fair amount of time.  For instance, maybe you do a 5x5 set of Backsquats in the rack, a 3x5 set of Front Squats and a 3x3 Deadlift.  Then you perform a short (less than 10 minute) Travel style WOD out of everyone's way.  Don't be the asshole in a crowded gym doing [Hero WODs](http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/faq.html#WOD1)

Ultimately if your only access to equipment is through a standard gym and they are ok with you performing Olympic style lifts (Clean and Jerk and Snatch) make sure you are doing them at times when it is appropriate and out of other people's way.  And I wouldn't suggest incorporating them into your WOD at a standard gym because of the reasons stated above.  I would include them as a skil/weightlifting exercise prior to a metcon around more commonly available equipment like a kettlebell or dumbell and bodyweight movements. 

**Home Gym Equipment**

For those of you lucky enough to have the space and disposable income to setup a gym I'm going to refer you this recent podcast by [Barbell Shrugged](http://fitr.tv/blogs/barbell-shrugged/8317589-how-to-build-a-crossfit-garage-and-home-gym-episode-71) because they covered it better than I can.  Additionally here's another piece from the the [Crossfit Journal](http://www.crossfit.com/journal/library/cfjissue1_Sep02.pdf) covering the topic of a Home Gym.

Some bare minimum equipment you could/should invest in:

* *Barbell and weights* - Invest in a good quality if you can.  You don't need top of the line but you don't want shit either.  Some good brands for bars and plates off the top of my head: [Werksan](http://www.werksanusa.com/), [Eleiko](http://www.eleikoshop.com/), [Rogue Fitness](http://www.roguefitness.com/), [Again Faster](https://www.againfaster.com/en/shop/) and [MD USA](http://www.muscledriverusa.com/Pendlay-Barbells_c_288.html).  Plates you can opt for the cheaper black ones made from recycled tires, but make sure you get bumper plates if you're going to be dropping anything from overhead.

* *Racks* - Racks can get pretty expensive and there a few manufactures but these can be as simple as an [H-stand](http://www.roguefitness.com/s4-h-base.php) or as complicated as a [Monster Rack](http://www.roguefitness.com/rm-6-monster-rack.php).  Note, I'm using Rogue purely because it was the easiest to locate.  Not because it's the only manufacture, obviously, so do your own research before you make a purchase.

* *Kettlebell*s - I will put more info in here when I research it, but you probably only need a 16, 24 and 32 kg at most.  Some may need larger, but assuming you're a beginner those will be plenty heavy.

* *Plyometric Box* - For Box jumps.  Plans can be had online to make your own or you can buy one.

* *Jump Rope* - Style will depend on your skill but you'll eventually want some type of speed rope whether it's a [$9 Amazon rope](http://www.amazon.com/Buyjumpropes-net-Ultra-Speed-Cable-Rope/dp/B004P3R6LE) to start or something more sophisticated like an [RX Jump Rope](http://www.roguefitness.com/conditioning/jump-ropes.php).  I personally don't feel the need to buy anything specifically marketed towards crossfitters, because a lot of the branded gear has been around for ages and is being marked up in the name of Crossfit.

* *Dumbbells* - You don't necessarily need these but they have their place such as farmers carries, dumbbell snatches and the occasional beach bicep curl.  

* *Pullup bar &amp; Olympic Rings* - From the pullup bar you're going to be able to perform L-sits, Knees-to-elbows, Toes-to-bar, Pullups, Bar Muscle Ups and the PU bar is where you can hang your rings from etc..  Most Power racks these days accommodate space for a dedicated pull bar or have one built in.

* *Medicine Ball* - For WallBalls primarily with some use for medball cleans or russian twists and other miscellaneous exercises.  

Again, reference the Crossfit Journal article, and decide what your goals are, what limitations your Home Gym space has and then make your decisions about the equipment you need to buy.  At a minimum however, you're going to need a bar and weights, and a rack with a pullup bar.  This will get you 80% of possible workouts you can do as well as give you basics for building a strength program.

**Resources for Learning the Olympic Lifts:**

In the spirit of not reinventing the wheel, here's my personal advice and some great links to help out a beginner. You should do one or more of these things before you ever think about performing a Clean or Snatch in a WOD. So do these so you don't do [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtQUYdj2Ecg&amp;sns=em)

1. Join a Crossfit gym and learn the basics of these lifts.  They are not easy and take lots of practice to perform well and if you don't focus on getting the form and technique correct, you're going to either get injured or limit your capacity in these lifts.  
2. Find a local Olympic Lifting gym or seek out USAW (or similar) certified coaches to teach you the basics of these lifts.  
3. If you don't want to do either of the above watch videos on Youtube to see how professional Athletes perform these movements, and get yourself on Amazon and purchase a book like [Greg Everett's](http://www.amazon.com/Olympic-Weightlifting-Complete-Athletes-Coaches/dp/0980011116/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374622878&amp;sr=1-1).  It's worth it.

Additionally go over to the[ /r/weightlifting faq](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/wiki/faq) because those guys did a bang up job of putting together plenty of resources for beginners to examine and study.  Once you start lifting you can post a [Form Check] video as well and they'll be glad to help you out.

I started crossfit a bit over a month ago and I've had to scale them down in WODs to other movements multiple times... it was ticking me off. I've been trying my hand at muscle ups for about 2 weeks now, doing 2 or 3 attemps after my workouts. Today, it just clicked. I hopped on the rings, did a little swing and boom, I was over the rings! I don't know what I did differently, it kind of just happenned. Then I did 3 more.

Funny thing is, I've always been the short, scrawny kid (5'6"", 135lbs a year ago, 145lbs now) and figured it would probably take me at least half a year to get there. Now I've got this huge smile across my face that just won't go away!

Dan and Rich are both REALLY strong dudes... but, there is a difference between them. 
If you watch Rich's OHS starting position, his legs are narrower than Dan's. His knees bow out as he goes down, and drives up. Where as Dan starts with a wider base, and doesn't get the same torque out of his positioning that Rich does.
Dan comments about stabilizing the bar overhead, and it very well could be a shoulder thing, but it is important to realize the capacities to which you are limited in your hip flexors. If Dan was looser through the hips, he would have an easier time both staying stable through the lift, and having more weight overhead. 
take two minutes to Open your hip flexors, even if you feel like its a shoulder fault. It makes a huge difference.

I've been looking for a box in my area and finally found one that's not too far away and reasonably priced.  My schedule's kind of been a mess and I initially wanted to start last week, but I was finally able to make it and schedule my next few wod's.

As soon as I got there, there was a class that was running over.  They were doing a pretty intense wod which consisted of 4 rounds of something like 29 DU's, 20 KB swings, 20 DU's, 14 deadlifts, 100m run (might be off on the number of reps, but it was something to that effect) bookended by a 600m row and 44 burpees.  The first guy I saw as I walked in spotted me as a first timer and as he was gasping for air said, ""Run.  Run away as fast as you can...""  I knew it was intense, but that's what I've been looking for.  

A lot of time in my first session was focused on form, which is obviously key.  I've read a lot about deadlifts and whatnot, but hadn't actually done one, so it was good to go over in-depth the key components of movements.  The wod that I did was just a 10 minute AMRAP of 200m run, 10 air squats, 10 deadlifts.  I was definitely thoroughly winded afterwards, but scheduled my next 3 sessions asap.  I'm looking forward to being sore tomorrow and making notable progress in the coming weeks and months.

And I have you guys to thank for getting me interested.

At the very worst, it seems like the bench will be moved nearby to a place of the team's choosing.**

**Thanks everyone who signed petitions or emailed!**

[Story on SSG David Dunlap](http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/decorated-soldier-staff-sgt-david-c-dunlap-and-wife-killed-in-burglary-in-colorado-springs). In short, he and his pregnant wife came home and were killed by a burglar that was in their house. He had just finished serving almost 10 years, and was highly decorated. 

The group that placed the bench sought permission and were told that there was no actual authority over the incline, or at least that they were able to do it without specific authority from anyone. Apparently, now, the city has taken over the incline and is forcing it to be taken down. 

It's completely ridiculous that they'd turn around and retroactively revoke permission, ESPECIALLY since this is in honor of an american soldier, AND the group did its due dilligence before placing it. 


EDIT: Response from a councilman (or his secretary, but whatever)

&gt;Thank you for your message of support for the SSG David Dunlap Memorial Bench on the Mt. Manitou Incline.  I have asked our Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Services (PR&amp;CS) Director to do whatever is necessary to allow this bench to remain in place as it fits into the surrounding area and is a well made bench.  Of course, the city and US Forest Service cannot allow every organization or group to place a bench in this location without proper vetting and permits to ensure that it is fitting and safe; however, I believe an exception is proper in this case.  Since this falls under the authority of the Mayor, PR&amp;CS, and the US Forest Service, and not City Council, we can only (strongly) recommend that the bench remain in place.
 
&gt;Sincerely,  
 
&gt;Bernie Herpin  
&gt;Council Member District 4  
&gt;City of Colorado Springs

1363564938.0	1ahrrc	Summary of My CrossFit Pregnancy	cfmo3	31	5	24	"I started CrossFit last April and found out I was pregnant about 2 months later.  My doctor gave me the okay to continue with CrossFit, modifying as I felt necessary.  I recorded all of my workouts, and he looked them over at my appointments.  On March 6 (2 weeks before my due date) after 24 minutes of active labor and one push, I gave birth to a healthy 8 lb 7 oz, 21 inch baby boy (our third baby).  I was back in the gym doing body weight movements five days later, and I was back to my pre-pregnancy weight on day 6.  I felt great through the pregnancy and my postpartum recovery has been fantastic so far.  I would definitely encourage every woman to work with her health care provider to find an exercise routine that works for her.  Here's a summary of my pregnancy progress:


WODs (weeks 10-38): 144

PR’s: 36 (yay beginner gains)

OH Squat: 83 → 105

Push Press: 75 → 110

Double Unders: 3 → 26

Bench Press: 95 → 105

Deadlift: 185 → 275

Back Squat: 130 → 183

Split Jerk: 75 → 113

Clean and Jerk: 83 → 100

Crossfit coach and physical therapy student here.  Wanted to try and come up with some reasons why kipping pullups have notoriously been causing shoulder pain.  I dove into the literature on kipping movements into gymnastics and shoulder injury and came up with a few gems.  Here's the link: http://fitnesspainfree.com/?p=399

Finish off with some recommendations for injury prevention.  Hope it helps those with some sore shoulders!

Thank you sir, may I please have another!

I did the 3 round version, scaled down to 12# wall balls and 40# sumo deadlift high pull and 40# push press. Didn't measure my box jump but 20"" is probably about right. Don't catch your wall ball with your face, it doesn't feel good.

Overall, scored a 217. I was almost in tears rowing on my 3rd round because I thought I had another round to go and I knew I was getting dangerously close to passing out.

Freaking awesome... I've never been this excited about going to the gym and getting my ass kicked. I'm looking forward to setting a few more benchmarks (already did Fran) and working towards some improvements!"	t5_2qqfd	True

1349099457.0	10rdg1	First CrossFit Competition	kabool	31	7	29	"After 9 months of CrossFitting my friend/coach talked me into joining a small regional competition with him this past weekend. It was standard competition format with 3 WODS. 

WOD 1:
AMRAP 15:
20 Hand Release Push Ups /
10 Deadlifts at 275lbs /
200m run with 20lbs med ball   -  **3 Rounds + 27 reps**

WOD 2:
3 rounds for time: 
15 Power Clean at 155lbs /
400m run   - **15:30 finish**

WOD3:
AMRAP 7:
7 Power Snatch at 95lbs /
7 Burpees   - **5 rounds + 3 reps**


There were 24 men in the RX division and another 9 that competed in scaled weights. I was able to compete RX and complete all the WODS exceeding my expectations on rounds I wanted to complete and finishing on the second WOD. The top 10 men went on to compete in a 4th WOD for rank. I wasn't able to make it into the top 10 but I did finish the competition and that's all I set out to do. Here are some of the pictures that a friend was able to get.

I never thought when I started this 9 months ago I'd be in the kind of shape to enter a competition, let alone finish it RX and hold my own. I can't say thank you enough to the whole CrossFit community for helping me change my life.

This post isn't just to brag (though that's part of it :D) I just really love the community and all the great people I've met. Right now I'm getting ready for basketball season, but after that my trainer has mentioned the idea of taking me to the open. I don't know how I would feel competing against some of the craziest guys in our region, but I've come so far, it makes me excited and motivated to see what the future brings.
