Since mags for these are in short supply (at the moment) and links would be outdated in an hour, I'll paste a link to gun-deals.com (disclaimer, I am the owner of gun-deals.com) so everything is in one place.  In return, I ask if you find something outdated, please bring it to our attention by ""flagging"" the deal.  When we can automate, we do, but for some vendors, automation isn't feasible.  If you find something not on the list, feel free to add it so others can see it too.

1360176885.0	180hmz	A quick PSA about PSA	givemeadvice18	66	17	72	"(This is copy/pasted from a comment I left earlier)

I ordered 7 boxes of this Blazer Brass 9mm mid-December, while it was IN STOCK, and still haven't received it. Can't get anyone on the phone, and any time I email I get a formula email saying it will take 15 business days to ship my product. It's been way more than 15 business days. I'm considering calling my credit card company and/or the BBB to get my money back.

Don't get me wrong, I understand it is crazy and gun stores are having trouble keeping up with orders. But if you read reviews for PSA, you'll find that they are the lowest and least thought-of online gun dealer. Hire more temps, work longer hours, do something to attempt to keep up. Anyone who gets through to a real person gets snarky remarks and is encouraged to cancel their order if they are upset. PSA always had poor customer service, but it has now become non-existent.

That's my rant. Be aware that purchasing from PSA will take a great deal of time and you will be left in the dark. I won't be buying from them again, and if I don't get confirmation my order shipped in the next few days, I'll cancel my order. It's not right to take $100 from someone on a promise that sometime, months later, they may fulfill their end of the deal. Purchase at your own risk.

**EDIT: This is absolutely hilarious, but I just got an email saying my order shipped. I think I was right about them using the current inventory to fulfill prior orders. Anywho, I still think I'll be very hesitant to order again.**"	t5_2rq8n	True

I'm running a special on our large AR500 plate targets and also wanted to let you know IPCS torso's and diamonds are back in stock and start as low as $12.99!

Normal price on the plate is $56.99 and we've dropped it to $45.02, 21% off the normal price. http://www.shooterselement.com/index...w&amp;product_id=5 
We are limiting this to stock on hand, so once they're gone, the price will revert back.

We also have our popular torsos and diamonds back in stock, along with the diamond challenge package so don't wait too long as these are the most popular items we have at this time.

If you have any questions or comments please feel free send an email over to sales@shooterselement.com, I'm always looking for suggestions on how to improve or what products to offer.

Grips showed up today in the mail.  Still no contact from the seller, however, the grips did eventually show up.

**END**

So I was looking for a set of wood grips for my P220. I didn't want to spend a lot but that's not usually possible when it comes to good quality grips. I just wanted them for presentation.

I did some searching and found Grand Blue Grips. It's out of southeast Asia which was my red flag. But after an exhaustive search, I found nothing negative about them. I did, however find a few positive reviews.

In light if that, I figured that I could throw $45 at it to see if it would pan out. So I went to their site and found this...
http://grandblue-grips.com/product_info.php?cPath=27&amp;products_id=198

I saw that it took a month to get them and was satisfied with the wait. I'm a pretty patient man.

I ordered them on February 13th. They shipped on March 30th. 6 weeks, no big deal.

What I got was P220 grips for the old-style heel-catch magazine release. They don't fit my P220. I went over to the site to look again, the grips in the picture are of the modern-style grips. I scoured thoroughly and found no mention of the old-style. They were beautiful, but wrong. 

So I sent an email to Grand Blue Grips. A week later I got the following response:

*Dear Sir,*

*I am so sorry for the problem. I will re-send another one which has magazine release* *near trigger guard for you.*
*I am really so sorry for the problem.*

*Regards,*
*Grand Blue Grips* 

This was on April 9th. I have emailed 5 more times since then but have not heard a peep. I'm not sure what to do at this point but to share my story.

Make no mistake, they did deliver the first time. However, they really were not able to come through on fixing their mistake. Oh well, at least it was only $45.

Buyer beware - if you order, be very, very specific about everything. In the mean time, I've got some pretty nice grips for heel-style mag release I may sell soon.

1375970632.0	1jyeya	Capitalism at it’s finest, 10% off AR500 and target stands at moatargets.com	nvgeologist	13	2	6	"Greetings fellow [Bargain Hunters](http://i.imgur.com/nNDmG67h.jpg)-
I build AR500 [steel targets, and all terrain stands](http://i.imgur.com/okSzNysh.jpg) to mount them on. 

I’ve already posted this in r/guns and r/longrange, but as capitalism seems to be thriving in this sub (Howdy SE!), I figured I might as well take it on front and center. 

At my website, www.moatargets.com I’m offering 10% off with code COME@MEBRO to reddit for approximately the next 30 days as a test run. If it works out, I’ll look into extending the run.  Discount is on targets, stands, and hardware, and there is no minimum purchase. Shipping is flat rate for stuff that will fit in USPS flat rate boxes, or by UPS. Unfortunately, because I’m lazy, I’m only shipping to the USA right now. By popular request, I’m looking into shipping to our Canadian friends, but I’m still in research stage on that. For now, if you’re out of the USA and want my targets, meet me for lunch in Reno, Nevada, and you can put them in your luggage.

You can (for all practical purposes) any shoot caliber you want at AR500 targets as long as you follow the rules, which you guys probably know as well as I do. http://www.moatargets.com/our-AR500-steel (tl;dr don’t shoot steel with steel, and stand back far enough to be safe). I’ve shot these targets with several magnum calibers at this point, including 300 Win Mag (fine at 200 yards), 338 Lapua (fine at 250 yards), and 50 BMG ([oh god my target](http://i.imgur.com/midcctX.jpg), go back further). As long as you follow the rules, you’re good to go. In general, you want your velocity at the target to be below 2,800 fps, and using steel or bi metal jacket, or steel core is right out. I’ve also recently read a study that indicated that solid copper projectiles have a risk factor very similar to steel jacketed and steel core ammo for risk of ignition, which is a topic for another day.

The stands I build http://www.moatargets.com/target-mounting-hardware are designed to hold up in windy and rough terrain without needing to be weighted or staked down, just run longer 2x4s in the base, and you’re good to go. You can get them in any width, and you adjust the height with your 2x4 uprights. Standard widths are 20” (targets up to 14”), 24” (16” targets), 30” (21” targets, or doubles), and 36” (26” targets, great for full size IPSC and [weird combos](http://i.imgur.com/VekwNHL.jpg)

I can do custom targets, if it’ll fit on a 60-120” sheet of steel, I can cut it out. I will be building dueling tree, plate racks, and poppers in the near future, just getting my designs finalized. 

So there you have it. [High class targets](http://i.imgur.com/uwNld5n.jpg) at low class prices. 

tl;dr- 10% off steel at http://www.moatargets.com with code COME@MEBRO

Sadly, I can't seem to find a local FFL who will receive a stripped lower for me.  Some just outright won't do it and I had one today who told me no stripped lowers because "" I don't know what you're going to do with it.""  (He had a Stag stripped lower for sale in the case below me as we spoke.) 

I understand that I live in gun friendly MA (Western half) and I should expect a little extra hassle, but I wasn't expecting this kind of push back.  Anyone have any idea why this might be the case?  Can anyone recommend an FFL that is transfer friendly in my neck of the woods?

1341864329.0	wacw5	Request! LF Best possible deal on 7.62x51 	yubnubb	11	1	17	I prefer military surplus by the crate usually. I don't usually go for anything with animals on the packaging. (unless the price is so ridiculous I can't pass it up.) I'm fine with steel jacket/copper washed/brass. Corrosive is fine with me also. i have a great method/plan for extended use of corrosive ammo use maintenance. I prefer FMJ no hollow or soft tip. I also like the high end stuff, just so long as it's no hollow tipped or soft tipped. But as I first stated my ultimate preference is for military surplus still in the crate unopened.  Any leads or offers would be greatly appreciated. I'm located in Louisiana for any dealers who fit the bill.  And while we're on the subject I'd prefer not to buy any crazy hot home loads. I'll only buy home loads if you can present me some legitimate references. And you're properly licensed etc.  I have google'd this particular ammo and I am having trouble finding it by the crate. So I figured reddit could make my dreams come true. Thanks guys! 	t5_2rq8n	True

1312371305.0	j7n6g	I signed up for Gearhog with a new and unique e-mail address... I'm getting more spam than I get from my facebook e-mail.	GeneralDisorder	13	4	11	"Anyone else sign up for Gearhog and notice a sudden influx of spam with the following subjects:

Waterproof &amp; Ultra Slim Wallet.

Get The Sexiest Legs Ever

Tired Of Cramped Space?

In need of a dentist?

I last checked that mailbox on Saturday at about 2PM and here on Wednesday at 7 AM there were 63 new messages and 3 from Gearhog.

Some relevant details (not really proof positive but pretty damn likely that Gearhog either gives out addresses or got their sender's list scanned):

The e-mail is a sub-domain which I usually only get truly unsolicited junk to info@thisisonlyatest.imnottellingyoutherest.com but this is a single mail account with only one address (I have a catch-all that I normally use for junk stuff). The address begins with ""name1"" (never showed up in a dictionary attack before). My first spam flood was the same day as my first Gearhog e-mail (about 6 or 8 messages). They're all SPF neutral (that's sender policy framework which is something that Gmail uses meaning Gmail wouldn't block this junk either).

I'm training my Bayesian filter to catch these but for now they're coming in with a very low SpamAssassin score and they're coming from legit .info domains (they're actually coming from the SPF approved sender).

UPDATE!!!:  I kind of forgot I turned off the filter for that mailbox. The timing of the spam attack is weird but I'm not worried (filter may actually start filtering again). Apparently that mailbox has been unfiltered since August 13, 2010. "	t5_2rq8n	True

Not really a deal but when I see 9mm under $15 for 50 online nowadays I consider it a decent find. 

EDIT: Forgot to mention I found it using GunBot ( http://www.gunbot.net/index.php?cal=9mm ).

Nov 2nd-8th - All Smith &amp; Wesson

Nov 9th-15 - All .22s. It doesn't specify .22 LR, WRM or whatever but it may depend on the persons in charge on what they'll let qualify.

Nov 16th-21st - All 9mm handguns.

Nov 25th-29th - All .40 &amp; .45 handguns. Like with .22s, it doesn't specify ACP, Long Colt, etc. What they'll let qualify could be up to the managers.

One thing you may be able to do if they don't have what you want in stock is you may be able to ask them to order what you want as a stock item for their inventory. Some stores may be more willing to do this for a customer than others, it just depends on policy. The distributors used by most BX/PXs are Williams, RSR, and Sports South."	t5_2rq8n	True

They also have windowed PMAGs at $19.97 (not a great deal, but all things considered, not terrible (compared to $30-$50 they used to be charging)).

EDIT: Let me be clear. I'm not suggesting that I am reconsidering my boycott of CTD. Occasionally, I use their site to browse items and then I'll find them cheaper elsewhere.

The master kit is already marked down. At PSA you get an additional 20% off of the kit (it shows up in the cart).

Now, to top this deal off, if you order a minimum of 300 dollars worth of RCBS equipment you can use the following rebate to get 50 dollars back:

http://media.midwayusa.com/pdf/coupons/rcbs-save-50-2012.pdf

You do not need to purchase from MidwayUSA. Just download the rebate.

---

Example (what I bought):

RCBS Rock Chucker SUPREME MASTER KIT $279.99

Hornady Impact Bullet Puller $24.95

RCBS 3-DIE CARB TC SET .45 AUTO $46.49

RCBS SHELL HOLDER #3 $7.69

RCBS STAINLESS STEEL DIAL CALIPER $48.49

RCBS VIBRATORY CASE CLEANER $86.99

Total (before discount): $494.60

Total (after discount): $395.68


I'll have spent $345.68 after I receive my $50 rebate.

This is definitely a good deal if you want to get into reloading now.

From Camera Land Inc
&gt; We had a demo day showing some Vortex scopes, one of which was the Vortex Viper PST 4-16x50 FFP Riflescope We took a few out of boxes (Both MOA &amp; MRAD versions), pushed them into rubber grips on wood stocks and after the event we packed them back up. We would not put these few scopes back into new inventory which presents the opportunity for todays ""Deal of the Day"".
