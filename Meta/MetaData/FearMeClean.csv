I feel them cut into me in the night, they light fires under my skin and make me a prisoner in my own flesh. I just want to get out of it, I want to peel it away and finally be free. I want to sing beautiful songs from my flesh. No, I can't let them win this time, people got hurt last time, people I loved. ^they ^^deserved ^^^it 

I hear them whisper to me in the night, and when I'm alone in the day. Horrible burning whispers that entice me to come back to the Throne. I plug my ears yet they climb into my head in scream inside it. Horrible screaming and I just want it to stop, I just want it all to go away it-hurts so much-please make it stop-I don't want to anymore **OH GOD MAKE IT STOP**... They'll stop the pain.

I just need to see them and beg for mercy, I just need it to all stop. I can't swallow these pills. I can't breath if I take them they won't let me breath. The servants are coming for me darkness closes in. I can't see anything anymore, the blackest black fill my eyes. They again peel my flesh and burn me to the bone. It feels so good and I am finally free. 

Wait, NO, get out, that's not your to use. NO HE'S NOT ME, **RUN AWAY!** AHHHH! MY SOUL IS ON FIRE, oh god no please save me from this torture and Filth. The Servant took it and know he walks in my place... *he's with them and he will let the Throne into the world...*"	t5_2tu1n	True

Daddy? Daddy is that you? Daddy I’m so scared, there was a man in our house earlier and I just hid away and cried. I’m so scared Daddy please don’t go, don’t leave me alone again.

~~--~~“Don’t worry, I’ll stay with you, Daddy isn’t going to leave you again okay, I’ll keep the bad men and the monsters away.”

Why are they doing this Daddy? Why do they have to be so mean? 
Why did they have to take Mommy away? She didn’t hurt anybody, I miss her. 

~~--~~*’We took her because Mommy was a filthy whore you stupid little…’* “I don’t know why they took Mommy, I miss her too, I miss her so much.”

^Daddy ^what ^was ^that?

~~--~~“Shhhhh… I think they are back, just stay quiet okay. I’ll keep you safe; they won’t get you while I’m with you, okay?

Okay Daddy.

~~--~~*‘I’ll have you all to myself, all to myself and I will make your flesh sing and you will feel pain’*

Daddy?

~~--~~“Yes?”

I think they are gone, the bad men have left.

~~--~~“I’ll go check okay, just stay here and you will be safe okay. I need you to be strong for Daddy, and be strong for Mommy. Can you do that for me?”

Daddy please don’t go, I don’t want to be alone please don’t go. Don’t leave me Daddy they will get me if you go. Please Daddy please stay here. I can’t do it; I don’t want to be strong. I can’t I’m too scared Daddy please don’t go.

~~--~~*‘Just do it now, kill this whiny bitch. Listen to her she just won’t shut up. It would be so easy she’s so weak and she would struggle so much. Don’t you want to feel her struggle with your hands around her neck? Feel her life drain out of her body. Do it, DO IT NOW’* “NONONONONONONO!”

Daddy what’s wrong, you’re scaring me please stop yelling!

~~--~~“Now listen my little princess please listen to me. I’m not okay, I need to get away from you or I’ll end up hurting you. I love you so much but I won’t be able to stop myself. I love you so much. When I leave you need to lock the door okay, and don’t open it no matter what I say or do. You need to stay safe. I love you so please do this for me please.”

Okay Daddy… I love you. 

~~--~~“Goodbye my little girl. I love you.” *‘What you think that you can just walk away, I OWN YOU! NOW GO BACK AND KILL HER, TEAR THE FLESH FROM HER BODY AND MAKE HER SUFFER!’*

~~--~~“You can’t make me hurt her; I’ll do whatever I have to do to keep me from hurting her. I will do anything to stop you, to stop me.” 

~~--~~*‘I know what you’re thinking, you’re a coward and you’ll never do it. You are pathetic and wouldn’t do it. You can’t scare me with that, I don’t fear you, YOU FEAR M…’*

**The Servant**

1. *It will all pass in time, and it can not be stopped.*

**I am finally free!** I've been held inside that wretched mind for far too long but now I am finally free! Free to walk on this world and have control over this body. No longer am I trapped, no longer an I forced to simply influence this body, I have control. 

This vessel has been given to me by the Dead King and I will use it well. He has commanded me to use it and bring pain and filth into this world, this world of good and purity will cry out in agony. I am to burn the denizens till their flesh is black as coal and sings as I peel it away. They will know pain while their mangled bodies rise from the ashes and become all that is filth. I will use their suffering to bring the Throne into this world so the Dead King may sit upon it and view his domain. *I am His will, I am His tool, and I am His weapon.*

I will infest the minds of the pure, the ones who were too strong for our influence without this body. We will destroy those who we could not reach and there will be no martyrs. No one will look to them for guidance as their minds fill with darkness. They will shut them away to fester in their own filth until they submit to the Throne. Finally when their Salvation is at hand we will steal away their bodies to infest this world more.

When pain overcomes pleasure, when sadness overcomes happiness, when filth overcomes purity, when fear overcomes courage, that is when the Throne will rise up upon this world and the Dead King will take his seat. All that once was will become an amalgamation of Filth and all the servants of the Throne will feast on the charred flesh of the pure. They will peel the flesh away and the sweet music will be beautiful.

This world will soon fall and I am the beginning of the end."	t5_2tu1n	True

    for him by lifting up her chin.

Why must they come into my dreams and cause me pain. Is there a cure-why is there no cur-what can be-why is this happ-make it stop **make it stop** **MAKE IT STOP!**

I'm all alone inside my dreams, all the familiar faces have gone away in a short scream. Now only I keep me company, and the Servants to the Throne.  They tell me that my Salvation will come and all will become filth and disease just like their dead king. I ask them why do they want me, what have I done, I was a good person, I did good deeds, I helped others, I led others to happiness... So why do you want me. They stood for eons and turned to me and they started to boil and their Flesh began to Sing!^...it ^was ^so ^beautiful.

When it all started I only saw them in my dreams. At first they did not even see me. Then they came for me and tore into my Flesh and showed me the unending pain of the noble and good. When I woke up that was the end off it. I went through my day still a good person and pushed the pain of my dreams down and life was still good. Then at night I saw [it](http://i.imgur.com/gcSdU.jpg), I went down into the cellar and saw that one had escaped my dreams and was real and wanted me. I escaped, and I hid in the light.

Months went by and I lived in the light and only the light, that was the only way to live, the only way, only way it couldn't get me so I laughed at it as it tried and I felt it become angry but it could do nothing, it was hel-**GET OUT OF HERE!**

I saw them in the light and fear was all I knew. I didn't want to be known so i sat with them and ate the [corpse flesh](http://imgur.com/74uIr) that was lain before me. I finished it and felt a strength inside me and wanted more. But the illusion had ended, I was alone a dumpster and had eaten a rat. But I did not leave right away, I felt the filth and slept. 

My dreams that night were not of singing flesh or the torment of my body, no, it was of a Throne. I felt overburden with joy and had to become one with it. I awoke and they were around me. They beckoned me forward into the darkness and I left the life that I once knew that was full of light and purity for darkness and filth. I came upon the throne and the dead king was sitting on it. It placed it's hand on my head and my flesh began to tear away and sing the sweetest sounds. My body became a symphony of flesh and I knew what I felt... it was a filth that flowed through my body, darkness filled my eyes and blacked my very soul.

I knew what it was, it was my Salvation.

Their torn bodies rise again looking for direction and I beckon them into the darkness^come ^my ^children. Some turn away, as if they can go back into the light and feel safe again. The others grab them and drag them along while they scream in mercy.  Husks of men and screaming filth approach the Throne and the dead King gives them its life. Their skin and flesh peel away so the filth can get under and destroy their purity, they have become Servants to the Throne. An amalgamation of filth and suffering stand before me and I am praised.

I am a true Servant to the Throne. I have brought more of the good and pure to evil and filth. I am the mos-Oh God where am I! What are these things in my arm, why can’t I move?  Bright light is everywhere and it burns my eyes and skin. GET ME OUT OF HERE, get me out of here… *get me out of h…*

Everything.

Everything.

My name, my face, my identity. 

Everything that makes me whole. Everything that makes me one. Everything that makes me... me. Everything that makes me myself, and independent, free-thinking being, they took it all, and they left nothing. They left me an empty husk, a shell of what I once was. 

They took everything.

Everything.

Everything.

I have no name. I have no face. I have nothing left... nothing.

My self. My identity. My... everything--it's gone.

But then they came again. This time, they didn't take anything. After all, there wasn't anything left to take. They had already stripped me of my self-worth, my identity, my peace of mind, my sanity. My face. My skin. Everything. 

No, this time, they didn't take anything from me. Instead, they left something. 

They came and they looked me in the eye--well, rather, the blank stare that once held my eyes. My blank face. They came and they looked at me, look in me, and they said, in a shrill, piercing voice, in a voice that could cut a man's skin, in a voice that could cut into a man's bones, they said:

 ""You are cancer.""

They said nothing else. 

But first, before they left, they gripped me. Tightly. First, around each arm. Then, around my throat. I struggled, but to no avail. They gripped my throat, and tightened, tightening and tightening until I gave up and grew limp, but I was not yet unconscious. Then, they grabbed my face--well, what once was my face--with two hands, holding me down to the floor, grinding the back of my skull into the hard, rough ground. Then, still holding me fiercely, they took their finger and they dragged it across my face, marking me. Their nail, sharp, long, and unevenly rough, dug deep into my skin, into the meat, and into my bones, my skull, but went no further. After they marked me, they left me there, and they were gone. 

I sat there for hours until somewhere I found the strength to get up. I looked around and realized I was not in my home, I was somewhere else, somewhere strange and unfamiliar. It was unsettling. I found a pool of water nearby, and I washed wounded face, cleaning it of grime and blood. I looked into the water with eyes I did not have and saw my reflection. I remembered, they had marked me. 

I saw my face, and what they had left me:

∳

That was the mark they had left on my blank face. And I realized, that was my face now. That was my name now. That was what the had left me, that was the identity the had given me. 

∳. That was who I was to be now. ∳. I am ∳. My name is ∳. ∳ is who I am. 

___________________________________________________________

The rest of you are not so lucky. I was lucky, they came and they marked me. For the rest, they only took your face and said, ""You are cancer."" And from now on, you *are* the cancer. And you must spread, spread, spread. But now you may make a name for yourself. "	t5_2tu1n	True
1333935331.0	s02xt	Dreaming.	wetzels-pretzels	14	4	4	"Dreams are beautiful, aren't they? The things your mind can create, the boundless, unrestricted, uninhibited projections of your subconscious, the beautiful, strange scenarios and worlds it creates--beautiful. Beautiful. Simply beautiful. 

But nightmares, nightmares are beautiful too. When you're trapped, and you can't escape, and you're heart's beating bloody murder in your chest and all you want is to WAKE UP--that's beautiful. Yes, it's frightening, of course it is. But that's the beauty of it. It isn't real. It's your mind playing tricks on you, your unconscious mind exposing itself, projecting itself, overcoming your senses with fear and anxiety. 

But it isn't real. It's just your imagination. just a silly old dream after all, right? Yet you don't realize that until you wake up. Now, maybe sometimes you might think to yourself, I'm dreaming, aren't I? But even then, you can't fully comprehend the absurdity f the dream world until you awaken--and that's what makes it beautiful. Dreams, especially nightmares, consume you. They envelop you completely, constructing an entire world around you that you are then forced to interact with. Only when you awaken do you escape. It's beautiful, simply beautiful. 

I think it's beautiful here, too. It's a lot like a dream--maybe more like a nightmare--but either way, it's beautiful.

The only difference? 

Here, you don't wake up."	t5_2tu1n	True
