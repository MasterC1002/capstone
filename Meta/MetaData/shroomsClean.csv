I've never tried any drugs except weed and alcohol so I was kind of nervous before shrooms and was even afraid I'd trigger a mental disease or freak out on a bad trip because usually I'm a really nervy and introspective person, very conscious of myself and my mind and have had some self esteem issues.

Nonetheless, I went ahead and ate roughly 2 grams of shrooms. I've always heard they tasted awful but to my surprise they were fucking delicious. I could munch on that thing all day long, really nice taste.

Right after I finished my meal I got excited and was ""feeling it"" even though it was probably placebo effect because shrooms take time to kick in.

45 minutes later, I was in this world...it was beautiful. I was happy. I was content. My life was perfect. And it went on for hours.
I didn't get visual hallucinations or classic ""trippy"" stuff...everything just felt normal. I felt sober. It felt like this is what life's supposed to be. I swear on everything that exists in this world, I gained COMPLETE mastery of my emotions or in other words, full control of my emotions.

What is being able to fully control your emotions? I know. I'm enlightened. I was so positive and happy, literally NOTHING could put me down. I felt like I had this inner, deep confidence and that NOTHING could shake me or break me.

Also I gained this magical ability to see myself from other people's perspective. Usually when I'm sober/on weed/alcohol I tend to get a bit carried off and I give off a creepy/weird guy vibe. On shrooms, I immediately recognized what I was doing and changed my behaviour. I felt all powerful. There was this one moment when I thought of a funny line in my head and I knew when I said it that everyone would burst out laughing. And that's what happened. I could present myself any way I want, I felt in complete control over my destiny, myself and...

fuck.

I can't ramble on any more. Long story short, shrooms made me realize that deep inside, I had the potential to be anything I wanna be. I am beautiful and powerful. 

Shrooms gave me confidence I will carry with me for all my life and for that I thank them. They showed me who I really was. And I love myself.

Life changing experience, nothing less. I used to listen but now I can hear. I used to watch but now I can see. I used to crawl but now I can walk."	t5_2qszq	True

http://vimeo.com/16776520

I had to take a few pages of notes during the video, and I recommend you do the same.  It's for *actual* neuroscientists and psychologists so you may need to look up some terms and get familiar with the areas of the brain (and how the brain works in general) that are active during a shroom trip.  The 27 minute video took me 3 hours to really soak up the information.  It was worth every second.

Edit:  /u/Huck13b3rryF1nn posted a fantastic summary of the video but don't let it stop you from really dissecting exactly what this video has to share.  I found it so profound (the video and researching behind it) that I *had* to share it with fellow shroomers.  "	t5_2qszq	True

Being the paranoid (and creepy) person that I am, I found this person's phone number and informed them that they're BASICALLY TRYING to get caught.

it's a little hazy but i still recall the more important aspects of the night. I didn't have much money or any plans for the evening, so i decided to just kinda delve in a little bit. I chopped em up with a knife, got the water to a boil, and then made the tea. I sat down on my friend's couch and waited for the effects to start.

about a half hour in, i could tell i was gonna be in for some shit. i saw the TV warp and melt into the wall. i knew i had to get outta there. i walked around town for awhile, ended up getting back to my apartment. there was some homies there hanging, getting ready to pregame and go to some shit ass kegger. they packed up some bongs, i ripped em, and then it was done. 

next thing i know i'm laying in the bathroom, puking. after i started to puke i got the most intense open eye visuals i've ever gotten(they were dmtesque, but a lot less fluid. very aztec/mayan looking patterns). i layed there for maybe an hour, maybe 15 min, it felt like an eternity. complete loss of ego. i became everything. it was ineffable. merging with the universe. 

after laying there long enough to come down i looked at my puke and saw thousands of faces in it. the puke was breathing at me, and i got a little weirded out that i was getting lost in my own puke so i left the bathroom. i looked at my hands. the fact that everything since the dawn of time had happened(the ""big bang"", dinosaurs, my parents meeting, every choice that anybody had ever made) and i was sitting there looking at my hands was too much for me to handle. i laughed. i was laughing hysterically for probably 15 min, looking at my hands. the cumulative point of everything was that moment. it was awe-inspiring.  

all in all, i'd say 8.5 grams in tea is a no-bullshit dose. just be prepared, read up and don't let your ""ego"" or ""self"" try to hold back the experience.

Everything was gone and I was alone In this strange world. I was listening to ""Coda"" by God Is an Astronaut, from what I think I know, I was lying down on my couch with my eyes closed, but I was running through this complex arrangement of roads winding through this world aging and gathering knowledge, I was growing. It was absolutely beautiful, but I was way too terrified, I was hurting, and I remember thinking, ""this Is It, I’m going to die."" I was so scared and I wanted It to end but I also wanted to enjoy the trip and the beautiful things I was seeing. It was too much, I opened my eyes and I looked around this room, It was similar to my living room but something was off, I couldn't put my finger on It. one thing I did know was everything had a personality, the chairs, the table, the candle holder, they all did. they all had these looks of shame on them, like they were shunning me, and It made me feel so lonely and lost. I then heard some one speaking to me, but It wasn't someone It was something, the candle holder. All It said was, ""Be at peace."", I closed my eyes and let the song and universe consume me. As the song drew to an end I felt weaker and weaker, I was dying. I felt my self begin to decay and my body completely relax, the earth began consuming me, and my body was wasting away, all that was left was my tiny consciousness, but even though I no longer had my body, I wasn't sad or scared, I was nothing, I was at peace. The song ended. As the next song started visions of the womb and fetuses, rebirth and finally I was back to myself a new person allowed a second chance.

1370580260.0	1fudnh	9 grams P. cubensis (trip report)	SomeMoron	30	2	15	"Events of today.

I've done a lot of drugs in my younger years, including mushrooms a couple of times before. My highest mushroom dose was 4 grams prior to today. I am female, and a daily Cannabis user since ~1997. I had a trusted sitter taking notes, and two 1mg clonazepam (my Rx but don't take often). It was a rainy day.

11:30am: I cut up 9 grams (dry) of P. cubensis into tiny pieces, soaked in a small amount of water (turned blue), and consumed all. I had two cups of green tea, but otherwise an empty stomach. I followed the cubensis with a pint of fresh blueberries, to settle my stomach, and get a little vitamin C. I'm prone to nausea, but was pleasantly relieved my ingestion method seems to minimize this, and only lasted the first hour.

During the first 1.5 hours, I struggled with maintaining composure, sense of self and reality. Due to traumatic events of my past, I've developed a skill at masking inebriation. When I realized this was going to interfere with my goals, I took 1mg clonazepam and locked myself in the bathroom to be alone and let things progress. I remember lots of yawning for some reason.

1-2:00pm: In the bathroom, I watched the rain, birds and squirrels, and started... detaching? I knew I wanted to do this on a rainy day, but had no idea how important this was. All of life was revealed. Words really don't do anything to describe this process. I didn't have visuals per say, more of visions. I saw my body becoming spores, bodies growing out of my ethereal being. I ceased being, Ego was abandoned. The mushroom became me. On a cellular level, I understood everything I reached a state of rapture and ecstasy. There were waves of glory passing through my body, I was euphoric, giddy, and tears were streaming down my face. I was not crying, but experiencing pure joy. I broke through the fabric of the universe and all was laid bare.

2:00pm: I set up the bedroom ahead of time, blocking out all light and setting up a green strip light (which I did not use). I left the bathroom and needed to lay down. What happened during the next two hours was overwhelming, and I was howling, grunting, and rolling around on the bed. There were a lot of body secretions (mucous, tears, coughing up phlegm, and ovulating too) there was fluid everywhere. I've always been connected to the earth and am a biologist, and my experience today confirmed everything I already knew. I felt earth and life passing through the center of my body, it was if I was giving birth to the earth. I think I had an orgasm, but it was not sexual in any way. Just complete oneness with life on a basic and cellular level. This is not the best description, but as best words can describe. I processed deep emotional pain and traumas from my childhood and teenage years, issues unresolved for two decades. I'm not sure about the the long term effects from this trip, but I made more progress today than years of therapy have provided. This was an intensely personal but beyond person-hood experience. I've finally gotten where I've been needing to go my entire life. Beyond my self.

3:45pm: Started to regain composure. Still very euphoric and giddy, everything felt safe, new and soft. Cleaned up a bit, I was covered in snot and all manner of body fluids, and we went out for burritos at 5pm.

6:00pm: Came home and slept hard. I am usually an extremely light sleeper, but didn't respond to my name, and didn't get up until 11pm. Woke up with a massive migraine, most likely from dehydration. My body is sore, my throat is harsh from howling and indiscernible vocalizations of earlier. Going back to bed soon.

I feel a clarity of being I haven't felt since childhood. Under proper supervision, I absolutely support the use of psychedelics for treatment of depression, PTSD and trauma. This was an incredibly therapeutic experience.

Be safe, and happy tripping.

EDIT: The experience was very detoxing. The amount of mucous and tears my body expelled had a physical detoxification aspect to it, but I felt this on a much more spiritual level. I feel very clean, even two days later. Also, I am a scientist and an atheist, but don't discount that I was tapping into some very ancient knowledge. This experience was completely positive in every way. I have a deep respect for all entheogens, and am very happy I finally was able to access this one.

TLDR: Tripped balls, ego death, feeling fantastic!"	t5_2qszq	True

1368674211.0	1efghb	Amazing first trip, really opened my eyes to the world. Finally typed it up.	liandrin	32	3	9	"I was depressed (borderline suicidal) and had PTSD that no counseling or prescriptions had alleviated. It had been a long time. I was honestly considering just crashing my car somewhere when a friend/dealer/roommate suggested shrooms to me (she had a whole jar full and wanted a trip buddy). I said ""Sure, why not?"", knowing full well from various sites that you're not supposed to partake of them with preexisting psychological problems.

(6:00 PM) I only took about 2.0 grams (a little over half an 1/8) and discovered that I also was very sensitive to them. I ground the 2.0 grams of dried mushrooms up and mixed them with a drink and downed the whole drink at once and then waited for the visuals. I never got nauseated or anything, but my skin was little cold.

(6:30 PM) It started just with seeing halos of light around the ceiling lights, and within the hour I was fully tripping out.

(6:45 PM) For the first time in a decade I felt truly happy. Everything was okay, my worries were still there but I was free of them. I felt like a bird stretching it's wings, like instead of being a fuck-up I could do anything. I suppose this was the euphoria.

It was, in a few words, transformative and amazing.

I understood all of my problems and was able to discard them, and I felt clear-headed about the world for the first time in my life.

(7:00 PM) I saw mild hallucinations as well as the normal patterns (patterns forming people looming over me, eight feet tall made out of matrix-like blue shimmery code, but I wasn't scared because I knew they weren't malicious. I tried talking to them but they loomed and almost invisibly drifted about the apartment). This may be that I have always had an active imagination and vivid dreams and was seeing things inside the normal shroom visuals. My roomie was a little annoyed at how strong my trip was compared to her 'normal' one.

The walls and the ceiling were breathing but if I made myself focus on them they turned into rolling dunes of sand and I would lose time watching a desert landscape shifting like on fast-forward.

(7:30 PM) I looked at myself in the bathroom mirror (again against advice, I know!) and there were black patterns on my face like tattoos and white, delicate lace writhing up and down my legs and arms and chest. It was beautiful.

The bathroom curtain patterns turned into people trapped in the black swirls, tiny naked faceless bodies reaching out for me in supplication like an old renaissance facade of Hell. I'll tell you again that none of this was scary, it was happy and amazing. My roommate had taken the same amount of the same batch and only saw basic shroom visuals.

(7:40 PM) I took a bubble bath because it sounded amazing and lost time watching the bubbles swirl and slither up my arms and legs and breasts. None of this was scary, I was grinning the whole time (Damn you sci fi novels!).

(8:30 PM) I got out some fabric paint (we had a sheet hung up on the wall as a sort of group art project) and went to work, and the paint began melting and swirling around my fingers exactly like that scene in ""The Pagemaster"" It was so incredibly cool. It melted in the directions of my brush strokes like it was alive.

(9:00 PM) As I was winding down I just lounged naked (lace patterns on my skin!) in my computer chair, watching a dandelion dance on my screensaver. I glanced up and thought about trying to focus beyond the walls, maybe exert more control over the visuals rather than get lost in them.

After a few tries, the walls shifted and became slightly transparent. I glanced up and there was a transparent dark vine/tentacle thing wrapped thickly around my ceiling fan and hanging down, swaying. In the distance, through the walls I could see hulking tentacle creatures reaching up to the sky, all made of advanced machinery and coexisting with life outside. It was all very ""War of the Worlds"" or something.

(10:40 PM) I hoped the vision wouldn't fade but eventually it did and I was left with a few basic patterns before I eventually fell asleep at the end of the trip. I woke up the next morning feeling well-rested with no negative effects.

Overall it was an extremely positive experience for me, doubly so for where I was mentally at that time. I just remembered repeatedly thinking about how beautiful the world was :D

My friend and I were waiting on my russian friend to get off of work at Taco Bell so we started around (we had eaten probably 3 grams each about 30 minutes before). As we were walking we heard a faint sound coming from a nearby car wash and it felt as if we were being drawn towards it. We arrived at the car wash and sat down, my friend explaining that the sound was a song by George Strait and that it was his parents' wedding song. We listened for probably twenty seconds and I was filled with such contentment and all around happiness that I started producing tears of joy. He looked at me and patted me on the back saying ""Awe man it's alright, let it all out"" and at that moment I started thinking of my girlfriend and I missed her so. An overwhelming sadness hit me like a tsunami and I began to bawl my heart out. For a second I was alone but soon my friend also started to cry and said ""This song makes me think of my mom man, I'm such an asshole to her and all she does is love me. Look at my texts, do you see 'mom' anywhere here? Of course not because I'm a piece of shit"" and it gave me the feels. I now understand what beautiful is. It isn't looks or personality, it's the way somebody makes you feel. The way someone can make you feel conpletely happy but also make you feel such sadness that your heart aches when they're away. Life is all about love, it the whole reason we were put here. Our purpose is to find someone special and make them feel like they're the mokst important person to ever exist simply because they feel the same about you and you care about them.

1363027527.0	1a3hnd	My experience with shrooms vs acid.	Quantum_Immortal	30	3	12	"About a month ago I did shrooms for the first time, and having done acid before I was fairly confident I knew what to expect from another psychedelic. I've done mushrooms a couple more times since then, and I just kind of felt like sharing how the two drugs affected me in comparison to one another.

When I first did shrooms, it was at night time with a few of my friends and my sober friend was driving us to a park where we could chill out on a dock and look at some stars. The taste wasn't as bad as everyone had lead me to believe. After downing a couple grams we all sat in my living room listening to music. I felt very anxious at first, and slightly nauseous. Eventually the music sort of just took me over and I couldn't stop my body from tapping my feet or swaying with the music. This was different to me, because on acid I found music to be much more beautiful and peaceful, but with shrooms it was just a matter of the beat taking over my body. The anxiety was gone, at least for the time being.

Riding in the car to the park the anxious feeling came back. I related heavily to a dog. I was just so excited to get to walk through nature to a dock and just look out at the stars. I had all this energy, and I hated being contained in a vehicle. At least until my friend driving put music on. This time, Slipknot. A bizarre choice, but again the music just took over me. Dancing and bobbing my head was a good outlet for my energy until we got there, and I could run free in the parking lot.

We walked through a forest on the way to the dock. Everything my friends said was clever and funny. And at times the shrooms gave me a quick sense of wit that I didn't even know I had. Like they had a sense of humor of their own. We were doing weird voices, making goat noises, and just having a hysterical time. I felt playful, and just at peace with everything. I did not feel the same empathy that I had with acid, but rather, just an overwhelming sense of okayness with the universe. I felt emotionally close with trees and rocks and grass, and even mud. Nature not only looked more beautiful, but it FELT more beautiful. I just knew everything was exactly as it was supposed to be. Looking at the stars was nice, but really just enjoyed laughing and having a good time with my friends in the end.

The come down was much rougher than acid. I felt sleepy, exhausted, and the digestion process of the mushrooms just wasn't pleasant. I managed to sleep on the car ride back home, which was nice.

The other couple of times I did mushrooms I went hiking up a mountain. My dose was higher, and I really liked talking to other hikers. I had energy, and confidence, and this warm joyous feeling about everything. Again, less empathy. I didn't find myself wondering about people and their lives, but rather just trying to be happy around them in the brief moment we shared. I drank out of a river, climbed rocks, and went off the trail into the bush to find good spots to smoke a joint with my friends. 

In the end, I have to disagree with my friends. I prefer shrooms over LSD. Yes, the lack of shitty side effects (digestion, nausea, etc) is very nice. And I wish shrooms lasted as long as acid. But mushrooms are just so playful and happy. I love to walk and run and climb. I love nature. The high from mushrooms just feels so much more primal and natural. Acid is a very thinky feely drug. And I still enjoy it, but it just doesn't have the same humor and free spirited feeling that only shrooms have given me.

Thanks for those of you who took the time to read this. Just thought maybe somebody might be curious about the differences between the two, and hear about my first trip. "	t5_2qszq	True

1360352229.0	185cpb	Tripped for the first time last night.  Impressions.	Clam_Jammer	30	3	19	"I'm not usually much for these ""tell everyone about your experiences"" posts, but I had so much fun with this I wanted to write about it and maybe try to make sense of it.  

I'm in my 30's and had never tripped.  I'd ingested mushrooms before, other people tripped off the same batch, and I didn't.  Not sure why it didn't work.  This time it worked, and it was spectacular.

I ate a little more than 1/8th, probably about 4 grams.  I just ate them whole and chewed them up, chased with a little rum.  It was not particularly revolting, but obviously not delicious either.

It took a long time to take effect, around an hour.  The first thing I noticed was a body high not unlike what I get from xanax (floaty, pleasant), but much much better and much more intense.  I felt like I was being hugged by the cosmos, but at this point the euphoria was completely physical.

Maybe 20 minutes later I started to get some visuals.  The blinds were moving, then I looked down at a brown blanket and saw what looked like flowing sand dunes, moving like a river.  This was my best visual, it was not subtle but not threatening.  I kept moving jackets away from me on the couch because they seemed like they were trying to get into my personal space.  My friend and I kept jumping up to examine the blinds to see if they were really moving or not, at one point we employed a ruler.  

I wrote some shit down on my phone when I was in the apartment.  Far from profound, but here goes:

**The couch is breathing moving im typing but my thumbs don't feel like mine.  my body is a shell and I want to break out of it.  this is a lot of fun but not transcendental.  i want to go out and see people.  I am friends with all the lights.**

This was when the mental euphoria kicked in, and for the next hour or so I absolutely loved myself, everyone around me, and everything about the world.  

Everyone had warned me not to go out to bars, not to interact with ""normal"" people, but I wanted to push it, so I goaded my friend into walking to a bar.  We would have just enjoyed nature outside but it was cold as fuck so that wasn't in the cards.  It was a bar or the apartment.

Shit got WEIRD in the bar, lots of visuals.  My friend's pupils were huge and he looked vaguely like the devil, but in a funny way.  I had no desire to interact with anyone who was not tripping, but I was enjoying their presence and the human energy around me, all the good times.  I felt like I was a part of their good times even though I was just an observer.

We go to another bar to meet with his girlfriend and some of her friends.  At some point while we're at this bar, he loses his shit and just vanishes.  He goes home, it must've really hit him.  I stick around and have a mildly uncomfortable conversation with his gf (she reports I seemed normal), and then I leave.  I didn't flee in terror, I just knew it was time to go somewhere else.

I walk by myself to a third bar and meet a friend from work and his gf. At this point the visuals made everything look like a fisheye lens, everyone had abnormally rosy cheeks, and I was very aware of how large their teeth were.  He is the nicest dude in the universe, bought me a beer, remarked how it was cool that I was holding my shit together in such a loud/chaotic environment, etc.  

The crowd starts to get to me and I just walk away after what felt like 15 minutes but was probably 2 minutes.  Later on I felt really bad about leaving the beer behind.  I found a girl I'm friends with in the same bar, her friend had ditched her and so we hung out all night.  She says I was acting totally normal, just a little more full of love than usual.  I was high-fiving strangers and smiling a lot.  Visuals were starting to wear off and then when I came down I was enormously tired, a little queasy, but not unhappy.

I finally drove home and despite tons of yawning, I felt like my heart was beating quickly and I had a really tough time getting to sleep.  Woke up today and I'm still feeling the love a little bit.


I did not experience any sort of ego-death or self analysis, which is a bit of a bummer, but it just made the world an incredibly fine place to inhabit.  This was far and away my best drug experience ever and I look forward to doing it again when it's warmer and I can be outside.

Fletch86	24	3	2	" So I had been wanting to try shrooms for a few years now, the day before I move away from my home town/state is the day I try them. This is important for me to mention because of the clarity that came afterwards. Present was my friend who provided the shrooms and my girlfriend. Girlfriend was our babysitter whom we later coined our ""Tard Wrangler."" 

 My friend Tristan and I both had an eighth and we ate half on top of some pizza. Tristan has an iron stomach, I do not. It took all of my strength to not throw them up. But I prevailed. After we consumed half of our eighths we moved to my back patio that looks out onto a field and lake. Tristan started tripping first, about 30min after consumption and he just let himself go. I felt my mind fighting the shrooms. I imagined this intense battle ensuing in my head. The forces of things that are certain, and real, and being grounded in ""reality"" vs. what doors were about to be opened. 
 
 When my mind finally gave in, it was like an earthquake. I vividly remember everything around me shaking and then very slowly melting into the ride that would take up the next 5 hours. Tristan had asked my girlfriend to put some music on. Something relaxing. The first thing I noticed with music was the way it affected me physically. Some songs made my stomach ache and were really unpleasant. After a while, I got annoyed with my girlfriends choice in music and took control of it myself. For some reason I chose the Skyrim soundtrack. I highly recommend it. 

 After the music was chosen, I became fascinated with the field. It seemed the tall grass was swaying and dancing to the music. At one point it looked as if it was made of llamas. Tristan and I both agreed that it felt like we were in a glass dome, much like the miniseries/book. But this didn't bother us, we felt safe. After about 45min to an hour into the trip, we decided to finish the other halves of our eighths. Words cannot describe how annoying eating was. It became the biggest chore I have ever experienced. Tristan looked like a rabid dog eating his, I'm sure I wasn't much better. Here is where our tard wrangler came into play of having to wipe our mouths and clean us up. 

After eating, Tristan moved to the grass and became very possessive of things. My girlfriend was reading a book while we tripped. Tristan asked to see it, and began ""reading"" it. In his best Mrs. Doubtfire voice he requested tea. This is when he became very deep, questioning everything from pain, to cancer. Tristan then became very quiet and started to self reflect. 

I had already started this by staring into the clouds. The clouds were the most amazing and awe inspiring thing I can recall. The ends of them looked like fire that were twirling and morphing into various shapes. The world seemed like I was watching a 3D movie. My depth of field was completely expanded. As I stared into the sky, I felt more connected to...my spirit...the spirit world? I am still dissecting what it was i connected with, but it brought me to tears of joy. 

 I immediately became so appreciative of everyone around me and in my life. My girlfriend has often got on my case because I will often do things for the sake of other people that I personally don't want to do. This trip kind of made me realize that, while that is important, I need to make the people closest to me feel valued, and like I genuinely want to be with them. Not make them feel like an obligation. I instantly became confident in my life choices, and my choice to move away. That without this move, my life would be a dead standstill, and never allow me to grow up.

Thank you for reading this long ass post, and I apologize if it was too winded. As you know, its a lot to take in and process. I did give my girlfriend some of my shrooms and her trip was...interesting. If you guys want to hear her experience, I will write it down. Thank you again for reading."	t5_2qszq	True

1366215426.0	1cjgc9	Trip report: best trip of my life.	beatboxrevolution	26	5	15	"Hey errbody:

       Just wanted to write out a trip report after the best time, maybe of my life?

   I cant say that I'm an 'experienced' psychonaut, but I'm normally game for anything. A good friend had a solid mound of boomers, and my girl and I bought 2 eighths. waited a week and cancelled some plans to open up an Sunday afternoon to set the stage.
   
   This was the largest amount I've ever done, and the first time I've done it in a few years. 

    and it was... incredible.

   
  It ripped me apart in the best way possible. I won't lie, I was scared at first. I was anxious, and anticipating crazy visuals and idk if it was nerves or the effect of the boomers, but I had this vibration going through my lower back and arms that would NOT let up (and I mean the entire time, maybe for 4 hours?)

  We started riding this wave, and we both looked at each other and started crying.
I told her it was okay to cry, because I had to too.

  Everything was so goddamn beautiful. Me, her, us, our entire lives, just felt like I could see everything for the miracle that it really is. It was INCREDIBLY emotional. 
The most emotional trip I've ever had by far. I felt things that there aren't even words for. 
   WAY TOO powerful. Words were feeble. But here I am, giving it my best shot:

We were feeling this huge rush, and we were connected, mentally. I was finishing her sentences, she was finishing mine, we got it. we totally got it. We both saw these awesome patterns in her clothes, and we were seeing the same exact thing. Aztec symbols, woven into her clothes. Blew our minds that we'd both see that at the same time. 

Everything looked like it had moving algae on it. It was really beautiful, and it was all she could talk about. How she wanted to see that forever. I agreed. 

Then, she decided to open the shade. The sunlight was BEAMING in. Brighter than anythign than I've ever seen. I honestly thought the world was ending. 
    That a nuclear bomb had gone off in the sky, and it was all over.
    That was the only way something could be that bright. 
    She pulled the shade, and we went right back to things.

   Played coldplays dvd again. Wished we could do that 24/7. realized we could.

We walked into thte kitchen because she asked if I'd like to splash water on my face.
She's always thinking like that.
So I slashed a decent amount of water all over my face and arms. Felt crazy. Like I was wearing a type of armor, made of liquid.

So another stronger wave comes along and I get really energetic. I was pacing back and forth talking about how we worry about too many silly things, and lets give all of that up. I'm asking her out there questions like ""what will we do?"" and I knew it was weird sounding, but Idc about that around her. 

  And then I realized, everything, is just a choice. I looked at my life.
And I realized nothing in my life is by force. Not one thing. 

It just felt so... freeing. Like, everything is going to be okay. I must've said that 30 times.

Everything is going to be okay. We're going to be great. Amazing in fact.

I was filling up with this energy now. It was pooling inside of my body, and pouring out of me. My girl said my eyes looked like they were a different color of bright blue. Out of my ears, mouth, eyes. I jsut wanted to EXPLODE, to let ti all out, and I didn't know how.   And that's when I realized thats why I love being a musician so much.


   **TLDR; Cried from beauty, some psychic phenomenon, was positive the world was ending, realized everything is choice, that we're going to be great, and why I love my music so much.  
      Loving this afterglow, and loving life.**

It was a sunny summer day, extremely nice out.  Good warm temperature, nice cool breeze, good relaxing setting.  Me and 2 other friends(W and R) each took about half an eighth each, i took a bit more since my friends didnt want to finish their stems.  We were at another one of our friends houses(H),  which is on the water and has a nice big grass lawn.  We took the shrooms around 11ish, and the started to hit us around 11 30-40ish.  (We are smoking weed the entire time)

Now, W got straight up retarded.  He is a light weight, and gets fucked up easily, so this was not suprising.  He had an amazing trip and just seemed loopy the whole time.  It was R's first time, and he was just out of it.  He seemed calm, and everything went smoothly.  

Unfortunately for me tho, I had failed when I had made my plans.  Originally, I had planned on going to this party on an island about an hour away from our location, and I had assumed I would not be headed towards this party till 6ish.  Around 1 30ish, i received a text(I dont really have trouble with technology while tripping, the only thing that bugs me about my phone is how i subconiously continue to check it even though I have no need to) saying that my ride was leaving for the party at 3ish, and that i should head over around 2.  At this point, I was just like welllllll fuuuck.  To make matters worse, after a long morning in the sun, I let myself get dehyrdated, but I didnt notice since i was tripping. I started to feel horrible, lots of nasuea and sweat, I had no idea what was going on. Eventually i drank a good amount of water, took off my shirt, and laid down in the shade.  After a good half an hour of calming myself down, I was all good once again.  

So its around 2, and I figure its time for me to leave.  Im still tripping, but im definitely at the point where it feels natural and I feel like that im not even on shrooms, aka the point where you forget you are fucked up. I get a ride to where my carpool is supposed to be at, only to find out they really had no intention of leaving soon at all, they just wanted me to hang with them.  At this point, ive become very quiet.  I just wanted my trip to be over with so I could just go back to life.  It wasnt too bad fortunetly so I still enjoyed my trip.  After staying with these new friends for a while, they decide to go to subway.  Im still tripping, so this was a VERY VERY weird experience.

Once we sat down with our food, I just let my mind wander, and I just thought it was so strange how humans create little places for other humans to pay for an extremely overpriced meal.  I know i didn't describe that very well, and for that i'm sorry, Its hard :(

Eventually we went on our way, and i started to come down.  Thankfully we were smoking the whole car ride otherwise i definitely would have been struggling. 

Other trippy thoughts which occured to me that day is how fucking weird cars are.  When i smoked weed i still trip over the idea of cars, and how weird it is that us animals took a bunch of materials to create a moving steel box, and then proceded to build much of our culture around these steel boxes.  Just bizzare. This single thought that I had on shrooms has attached itself to my brain, and I get a little of the trippy nasuea feeling if i get high then start to think about cars.  I am very suprised with how much of an impact that this one thought has had.


TLDR: I took shrooms, plans got fucked up, i went to subway trippin balls, and I can no longer look at cars the same

After I ate an amount of shrooms somewhere between 2 to 4 grams (had to eyeball the dose because I didn't have a scale) on an empty stomach, I waited for the effects with a slight feeling of uneasiness. In about 20 minutes, time already started slowing down a bit and the grass started glowing. Then I felt the onset of nausea which was a little bothersome but I managed to ignore it. Soon after, it felt like every word I said to Joe came out forced and awkward. I realized that I was just filling the silent gaps in conversation with pointless blabbering. This thought caused me some discomfort and I felt self-conscious about my every word. That feeling, in addition to the nausea getting stronger led me to thinking that I wasn't ready for this trip and I also felt like my sanity was slipping.

At that point my memory starts blurring but I remember jumping from thought to thought intensely and quickly. It felt like I was going crazy and at one point I thought that nothing I was seeing was real. I tried reminding myself over and over that I ate mushrooms and this is just temporary, but I was beginning to believe it was going to last forever. It felt like I was a strange creature and I was starting to forget who I was and how it felt to be sober. Felt like my mind was slipping. I empathized profoundly with people who smoke weed or drink to escape reality because things felt all too real to face. I started to regret that I ate the mushrooms.

My next thought was the idea of letting go, and how I had read about the importance of not resisting the mushrooms. I had a lot of trouble letting go because of the magnitude of balls I was tripping. Finally, at one point the trip felt overwhelming and I just laid down flat on the soft grass to try to fall asleep. That's when it happened. I closed my eyes and just gave in... it's the only way I can explain it. It felt amazing. I felt blissful, no more uneasiness. It felt like my body blended with the ground and I couldn't separate it in my mind unless I moved. Honestly, even though I had let go and started feeling a positive experience, my mind was too fucky to remember a lot of things during the peak. I was lying down eyes closed during the entire peak.

The rest of the trip and comedown was incredible. I just felt accepting of every moment in time and content without changing anything. It was like seeing everything for the first time.

Now I understand the importance of letting go into the experience, and that psychedelics are on an entirely different league of their own from anything else. I will trip again this summer but not for at least a month, and perhaps a lower dose too hehe."	t5_2qszq	True

I ate two shroom chocolates which I believe came out to an eighth, from what my dealer told me. Consumed both of them around 6pm and tripped really nicely until the early morning (With frequent vape bowls in between). Now, I'm a slender guy who's about 6 ft. tall, weighing around 130-140 lbs. and I'm glad that I trip hard, I think I take pride when people call me a ""Lightweight"" in reference to drug use. Like yesterday for example, the laughter was just so.. Fulfilling! Swear to the universe that I laughed myself a six-pack! It was strangely amazing, I took notice to beauty past physical appearance. I marveled at the simplest of things and my mind just wandered to many interesting planes of existence. Though I know nothing of what I saw in terms to knowledge on my experience, I can say that it was enjoyable enough to make me appreciate life again... which is sad to say that some chopped fungi in milk chocolate made me realize the beauty of life, but in the condition that the Earth is in presently, the majority of earthlings live in a life of suffering. Earthlings referring to all life on earth of course, not just you homos..apiens. just keep loving out there folks, a lot of people need it, Even you.

1350961940.0	11xayx	Magic mushroom trip ended with me questioning my sexuality, identity, and relation to all life on Earth.	jericho4	29	8	11	"Okay so I don't normally post heavy stuff on the internet but I seriously need some counseling after this, so here's to my first throwaway account. Yesterday my roommate and I took a trip to Linville Gorge (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Southern_End_of_Gorge.jpg). Our intention was to spend the entire day hiking around and tripping on 4 grams of shrooms. Well, we got that part down, but what happened on that trip has changed my life forever. I'm going to go ahead and say that everything that had happened for my entire life really seemed to have come together to this point, like all of these questions and all of the problems shared by everyone I had interacted with since this moment were suddenly answered. Things have been feeling more and more...aligned, like something's been guiding me, and all my close friends can vouch for the same in their own lives. But getting back to the story.

The shrooms really started doing work about 2/3 of the way to the top of the trail, where the lookout would be, but since we were about to trip balls we wandered off the path and found our own lookout. It was a perfect rock formation sticking out of the mountain, giving us a sick view of the Gorge. The rock was surrounded by pines on all other sides and covered in lichen. I have to go into detail because every little thing came to life later.

Okay so we all have that general sense of ""oneness"" when we trip and we all see things dance and breathe. Well, that happened to me and my buddy, but to a much more profound extent. It started when he began to breathe deeper and deeper, and every time he did, it amplified both of our visuals. Eventually we started to feel a lot of energy throughout and all over our bodies. I eventually sat down and couldn't move, and my feet and hands began to vibrate and burn with energy, it was traveling from the ground to my foot, then into me, where I could channel it wherever I wanted. 

Alright, big deal. That stuff's kind of common. But then things really got weird, like abnormal even for shrooms. 

The sense of overwhelming energy and euphoria just became unbearable for a while. My roommate started looking at me funny, and eventually we started to feel an incredible kind of bond. I mean seriously, it was love. But not how you're thinking. This shit was real love, and we both had a sense that it was everywhere, you know, like a thing you can share with anyone. Well, that sense of love started to mingle with a sense of bliss and pleasure. For a long time, without touching one another, we were essentially having spiritual sex. Now I'm being totally serious when I say that this was all impossible to avoid. We're both men and were pretty certain of our sexuality before all this. It just overcame us both. I guess this is what some folks mean when they talk about an Earth Goddess. We sort of had to give in or otherwise vomit, and I swear he would have got physical right there if I'd let go of my ego completely. But the urge was definitely there in me too. The more intense this became, the more we seemed to become ""one with the earth"" and lose our ego. Then shit got even weirder.

There were bugs everywhere, mostly ants. At this point in the trip we'd kind of just decided to deal with them, but now they had all disappeared, as if we'd repelled them. I remember everything kind of had this dismal, sinking feeling for a while, then we came back up and the sense of bliss started to get wild again (this happened over and over, like a roller coaster (hmm...or a wavelength?). After a while (time was irrelevant but that's past the point) the ants did come back, but only whenever we were having a really intense moment. We discovered all these ways we could amplify our energy, harness it from the earth, spread it to one another. The better we got at it, it's as if the bugs were all over us, never threatened, more like they were attracted to us, like a wave of life --- wooosh, ants everywhere --- wooosh, gone again. (No, this was not a hallucination. The dancing mountains were, the ants were definitely not.) 
	Then we started having all these epiphanies together. This, other than the spirit sex, is probably what has bothered me the most. By now our consciousness was pretty much merged by how well we were channeling through the Earth. We were finishing one another's sentences, communicating totally telepathically, literally just using the Earth to communicate. It was all feeling most of the time, no words. It was truly fucking mystical, like I can't discredit this at all. So there was the first epiphany --- human beings can do this kind of shit.

Then the next epiphany came: We, the universe, the Earth, everything is a vibration, a frequency. Tesla was tapping into the frequency of the Earth to harness energy. We were doing the same, but with our bodies. And by tapping into that at the same time, we were both resonating it, becoming the same frequency.

Then came the big one. Oh man this one really hurts my brain, I just don't know what to do with my life right now. Forget questioning my sexuality, that's all irrelevant after this. 

We are all reflections of one another. We are the Earth, and spirit is energy, resonating at different frequencies. It flows through everything. When the Earth thinks, it creates life, because life is the Earth. Now that human beings are so advanced, the Earth has essentially evolved that level of consciousness just the same, and it's a collective consciousness. Now think of this for a moment. That means that the ego, sexuality, race, the whole idea of individualism is false. We are ALL LITERALLY ONE FUCKING THING. And what are people? We're the Earth's many avatars of itself, like polyps on coral. Just another frequency, like everything else.

All of these thoughts were flying back and forth between me and my buddy, becoming more and more refined, until BOOM. We stopped talking, we stopped thinking, even the wind stopped. We had just tapped into the Earth consciousness. 

We were first shocked, looking at one another with awe. It was like looking in a mirror, but a three-dimensional one in which you could interact with yourself. We were both parallel versions of one another, and the same goes for every being that ever lived or will live. Reflections, all existing at once in space-time. We knew that (well, we thought it, since talking wasn't even necessary at this point) if we were to fling ourselves off of the cliff, we would immediately re-enter existence through an alternate version of ourselves, chiseled up by a new environment, new experiences, and because of that a unique ego. 

But that is why you cannot think someone else's thoughts (when you're not tripping balls, that is). Because you already are. It's all a reflection and everyone and everything simply fills up every possible version of you, of THE EARTH. Becaaaaaause...

I am you, you are me, we are all together, and we are the Earth. That, my friends, is what my friend and I tapped into that day. By tapping into the frequency of the Earth, we could see past our egos, and acknowledged all of the people we had once been, still are. We were both masculine and feminine at the same time. Suddenly Adam and Eve made perfect sense. It's the story of chaos versus structure, masculine versus feminine, ever since life began. Time, irrelevant. Those mountains, well, you put it there. ""We"" is ""I"". I am a god. 

After the initial craze of bellowing into the wind, dancing like medicine doctors, and flailing energy around with our arms, we finally entered a perfectly bliss state. We had no doubt that every enlightened being that ever lived must have went through this. We looked out into the Gorge, feeling like Gods, much larger than the space suits of flesh and bone that grounded us there. Through us, the Earth had come up and peaked out, examined itself and all its progress, looked in the mirror for a moment. We knew we had done this many times before, in many places. Enlightenment is simply tapping in. True awareness, the god within us all. We were truly living ""in the moment"", acknowledging that this present, this awareness, this consciousness, is the ultimate, the most immediate.

Now that I've made my point on the ""I"" and ""we"" thing, I'll just refer to all of us as ""I"".

Every god, every demigod, every entity anyone has ever come up with, I created them all, changed the story, forgot things, remembered things, wrote it down, burned the libraries, rediscovered it and wrote it down again. Every ant, every plant, that's just another frequency of the same consciousness, like frequencies on a radio. All you do is tune in.

I am having a very hard time returning to reality after what I have experienced. My roommate and I are obviously going to have to face what happened with this spirit sex thing, I guess come to terms that it was just unconditional love and it can be achieved with anyone regardless of gender and all that. I now see every single person and thing as me in another form, the same consciousness. We passed an old couple on the mountain shortly after coming down a bit and had an overwhelming sense of connection with them. It was us, crossing paths with us. Weirdest shit ever. We made a connection with those people and became part of their pack as we ascended the mountain, it was eerie how easily we did that.

The whole day was full of strange things. As the sun was going down we were a bit lost in the woods and thought we'd have to sleep out there, but somehow we found our way out. The Earth, err, I, was still guiding me. Fuck this is so hard to comprehend or explain. That night I got a text from my schizophrenic friend, knew it was him before even looking at the phone. The list never ends.

So I guess my question in summary is this: How the fuck do I keep from going insane after this? "	t5_2qszq	True

I would like to think I handled it well, but what exactly is handling 2/8ths of shrooms well? Atom Heart Mother and mushrooms go very well together. 

Anybody who is thinking about taking this many mushrooms should do so with caution. It is very hard to control yourself when you look at your buddy and he has 10 eyes.

Also make sure you stay hydrated and eat food. We went to the beach as the trip was winding down and one of my friends , who also ate a quad, had a heat stroke and completely passed out because we forgot to eat and drink all day.

Like, at the core I mean. Because, okay. So we are all these thoughts. All these emotions, and memories. Our experiences. Our experiences build our memories and in turn lead to our thoughts and to our emotions, and it’s those things that make us who we are. But what is at the core? What is everything built off of? What’s inside?

nothing.

There isn’t anything inside. Not really. 

All we are is these little discrete experiences, feelings, and thoughts, all bundled together in a consciousness. We’re held together, in this physical body. This form. But at the core, it’s just bound together in its own tangled web. It’s not wrapped around anything. It’s suspended in nothingness. A vacuum. Everyone has a vacuum inside of them, and they just don’t see it or feel it or know it because we’re all so occupied by what’s floating around in our head all the time. 

We are built around emptiness, a void. 

So what does that mean?

I’m not quite sure. Everything we are is just shards of existence, drifting inside an empty space contained within a convenient physical body and linking together in a spindly spider web in order to make the people that we all are, and I guess that’s okay because it is what it is. I guess it’s just kind of strange. It’s like being on a bridge, that’s being suspended by giant pylons, and cables, except when you finally walk to the ends you find out there’s nothing there. Or being in a giant steel tower, with beams extending in all directions, tangled and drilled together with bolts and screws for miles and miles. And you climb down this colossus, down into the dark, and then when you finally get to the bottom, there’s nothing. It’s stray steel beams, floating in the nothingness, far away. Everything that’s been built up, it’s off an assumption of an assumption and there’s really no basis. It’s like writing a math proof, if you started by making an assumption and then got to the point in the proof where the assumption didn’t need to exist. You’ve built up this massive thing based off a common point, but that common point doesn’t actually exist anymore. Hell, it didn’t even need to exist in the first place.

And the truth of it all is, we’re all trapped alone in it. Trapped in our own minds, in ourselves. There’s actually no true way to escape it (well, except death, I suppose, but no one is proposing that). And you are alone in your tangled empty prison, you have to face yourself every single moment of every single day of your entire existence alone. Because what other people see, it’s not you. Seeing you from the outside is like seeing a shadow of the truth. A photo of a painting of a sculpture of the truth. It’s a part of you, an angle, but it’s not actually all of you. No one sees that. It’s all filtered. You’re a book. The outside isn’t seeing everything that’s really going on, just certain details. No one really knows the storm of thoughts flowing in you constantly. Every conversation, even the deepest ones, are superficial at the end of the day, at least compared to the pure, true ideas in your mind. The same topics, the same attitudes, the same people, every day. And you’re only seeing a part, one part, of the kaleidoscopic cyclone of existence. 

And even then. They’re just shells. Hollow earths formed around a nonexistent nexus of gravity, floating amongst other hollow earths in the solid, concrete, ever solid ever stoic earth. 

But that’s the best there is.

That’s the best we’ve got.

And that’s okay.

Because at the end of the day, we all do alright after all.

better to be a manipulator than to be the one manipulated
but the manipulator in reality creates the manipulated\

even justifies itself as explaining it in terms of people needing to be 
governed
why must we govern?
and to what end?
i want to live in a world where i don't have to worry about someone stabbing 
me in the back
i want to live free of paranoia, persecution, 
such petty trivial things
i want to live in a world where equality is not an illusion but reality
where the resources are available to all who seek them
where the manipulator is not the best rewarded of beings
as an artist, i seek to manipulate my environment, regions of sound
into something pleasing
something comfortable
not frightening like the world can sometimes be.
i want to be free from being recognized as an individual crafter, but 
rather be part of a chain that sought similar results.
call it what you will
brotherhood, camaraderie, union, there is something inherently present
in the fabric of existence which connects us all.
no one should seek to profit from seeing this truth.
all avenues of truths should be made available for all regardless of 
where you come from.
words are frivolous. they complicate the matter because they are so often misinterpreted.
so often themselves manipulated into justifications for the individual who is 
on a path he does not understand and seeks to  comfort or ease his suffering.
it is a catch 22. 
that is the truth. and when the thing realizes that it is chasing its own tail,
it may laugh, it may feel as though it was duped, perhaps fooled into something.
lash out...
but regardless of what or how it reacts, it is part of the same continuum.
and we must treat it with respect.
why?
because that is the whole truth. it is unraveling itself. continuously 
chasing its own tail. seeking comfort and serenity. you can get on anywhere you like
but it's all the same.
to live in present is closest to serenity because it is the most easily available
or the easiest to understand. now. here. i feel it and it exists.

there is no competition that exists in debating what time it is. it just is that time.
if you try to understand what came before, make sense of what they saw, it won't be easy
specifically for the reason that you're out of time and context. they didn't share your now.
they weren't concerned about debating it because the truth is true regardless of time.
it looks different, may get  more complex as the population grow, but in the end it's still
the same. different people talk about different ways.
scientist talk about it in terms of a thing that is expanding, retracting, so on.
religions thinks there a force behind it all, and they full heartedly 
fuel their own ambitions against each other. they miss the point entirely.
some people are still just interested in living their lives in a way
which causes the least amount of suffering.
they don't know how to fix those who suffer, but can prevent from causing it.
they are caught in the middle of these issues. these illusions.
all frightening. all governed by people.. wealthy people.. who know all too well
this truth and provides its citizens with the soothing comforts of living 
a day to day life, concerned with at the very least conserving what they've got.
preserving it as long as possible. and who can blame them for seeking that comfort.
that resolution. and who am i in the midst of all this.
a person who gets off on understanding or perceiving this truth.

i am but a cog in the machine.
a connector of ideas or people, who is caught in this shitstorm and 
often feels hopelessly alone. 
did i fall in a trap? or a leap of faith?
or perhaps that in reality there is no gap but the gaps that we create.
and that we in turn seek to repair.
chasing its own tail.
circle jerk. 
i won't go into the details for your amusement, but you get the idea.


upon further reflection, i'm curious whether or not the matter of my 
getting off on making these connections or even presenting these ideas
in any way harms other people. i do not think that it does but then again
i can never quite be sure whether or not i am falling into the category 
of manipulator when i utter the words.
the crafting of the sentences and words which convey these ideas are in
themselves a material that is being manipulated.
and i think that although this has occurred to me many times before, i can
never quite get that idea out of my head.
so, in the face of that, i seek mastery, not of rhetoric but of a material 
or a form which allows a universal connection free from words. 
this form is music.

once in a while i will try to fit words into it, but really all i want
is for you to feel comfortable. even if only for a short time.
don't praise me. don't reward me. just feel happy. happy that it exists
and that it is possible for you at that very moment to lose yourself.
or find yourself. whatever it is. just relax. this is love.

it is much easier to experience this when  you are young
because you are less frightened
it can seem very appealing, alluring innocence
again, something that can be manipulated into creating an illusion
an appealing illusion
filled with images riddled with beauty. a rose that is blossoming.
in bloom as cobain put it.
""but he knows not what it means""

on a side note, the french word for yes is oui
which charmingly sounds the same as the english we

precedent for all other reality tv shows was really just an artificial 
reality show. it was arranged in a way to enable situations in which
we the viewer would observe these people who are trying to figure out
what to do in the face of a game that is rigged so that only one winner
is possible. this is why i think it is so interesting. but in all honesty,
i'm amazed that it has lasted as long as it has.
sure, the producers have tried to change the game up a few times.
never fell short of providing eye candy for their viewers to consume.
by which of course i mean the scantily clad bikini women running around
or the ripped dudes with cut abs. and everything in between.
their contestant selection has always no doubt based on these factors 
first and foremost. but the show hasn't really changed that much.
the goal or object of the game is still the same.
this show has been running for 24 seasons with at least 2 other seasons yet to be made.
The format for Survivor was created in 1992 by British television producer Charlie Parsons.

I took a 10g trip 2 weeks ago and downed it with lemon juice, tripped for 10-12 hours with amazingly powerful visuals and had a awesome time! Friday I only took 5g with lemon juice, everything started out normally until I decided to shower. I had music playing in the back ground but the music didnt stand out to me as it usually did and for some reason I demanded that ""God"" prove it's existence. Within seconds my mind was blown with great power and thoughts I could not describe, these thoughts were not mine and were talking to me, not with words of this world but I understood everything that was said and it would control my thoughts to show me how weak I truly am. I literally had to beg for it to stop! my mind was becoming too much for me to handle. I am not normally the religious type and really never care to talk about religion so this is still blowing my mind that something like this happened to me, I cant help but question... was that really ""God"" or was I just tripping and my mind is just making all this up?

1345702770.0	yomc1	First trip	deadmau534	19	1	5	"I've smoked a lot of weed up til now when I tried shrooms for the first time. 
I ordered 3 grams from the silk road. Psilocybe cubensis if I recall. 

My partner and I imbibed 1.5 grams the shroom around 3:15pm. We only ate 1.5grams because this was our first trip and we didn't know what to expect. Around 4:20 I start to feel it. Everything looks more interesting. My adventure time poster looks like its wobbling. We do a bowl of trees and go for a bike right. 

It was a little difficult to undo the bike lock, but that could have been the trees. We start biking and I starting getting meta. My brain is constantly thinking about how were just monkeys and I am nothing more than star dust.  I am having a lot of fun biking. I don't notice and or care how fast I'm going, its so much fun to swerve around. 

We come down a steep hill to a busy stretch of road. It made me anxious. As were biking fast down this hill I start hearing a high pitched roaring. Im not sure what it was, but I start hearing chords of it. 

When we get to the park I am very relived. All the trees look awesome. I really want to stop and look at them, but we keep biking. Everything looks so vivid. Its like turning on the 'bloom' effect for real life. 
This whole time my mind is filled with strange, deep and, some depressing thoughts that I can't shut up about. 

We find a spot by the river to sit down and admire the nature. We didn't notice how shitty of a spot it was until we got there. There was a factory visible through the trees and it very noisy with the sound of trucks. The water was pea soup green with algae from the phosphorous polluted water.  I loved looking at the trees. One tree had leafs forming geometric patterns. My partner had a panic attack for no reason. 

We biked and I noticed how dirty/shitty my apartment building was. It was very hard to lock out bikes. The whole time I was in my apartment, I just wanted to be out side with the trees. I wondered about mans place in nature. 

Time: 6:20

We were sweaty after the bike ride and took a shower. I looked in the mirror and saw how dilated my pupils were. My pupils are normally tiny, and now they were normal sized compared to other people. 

I kept forgetting what I was doing, but felt like I had to keep moving. Trying to find clothes to wear was really hard when your naked and wet. 

I go visit friends who live nearby. I ring the door bell and don't get a response for about 30 seconds. I find out reason for the delay is one of my friends was going into diabetic coma. She need a mountain dew and and she recovered fine. For the first time in my life I can feel compassion for someone sick and I am freaked out by the mortality of the situation.  

I hung out with them until the shroom wore off. I didn't really notice when it happened, because I was still high of life and having fun. 

This trip was really fun. I saw some cool stuff, I felt amazing. My mind was like a Joe Rogan rant. Trees don't seem to have the same effect on my now as they used to, but I just did the shrooms yesterday. I am thinking of trying it again but a bigger dose, maybe 2.0 - 2.5 grams and going camping (not alone).  "	t5_2qszq	True

1372353781.0	1h6umr	Very effective psilocybin dosing method	frank_mania	21	3	7	"In response to a recent question regarding the heat-sensitivity of psychedelic alkaloids, I was reminded of my favorite way to imbibe psychedelic mushrooms. The heat involved in this method--100C and lower--appears to have no deleterious effect on the active ingredients. As well, I've been told that the constituents of P. cubensis &amp; related species which can cause nausea are fat-soluble, and fat-solubles are largely bypassed from consumption with this method (unlike using an alcohol solvent). Between my own experiences and others’, I know of scores of times that this was used quite successfully.

At least 1 hour, preferably 2 or more, since your last meal (an empty stomach generally increases sensitivity to the alkaloids):

1) Bring 12oz/360ml (per dose) of water to boil in a pot. Turn off heat, add desired fungus and some mint leaves. I don't recommend caffeine-bearing tea, since the come-one by this method is so intense that complicating it with other alkaloids is undesirable.

2) Allow the brew to cool to room temperature. Once it is, strain and drink the full 12oz all at once.

3) Re-fill pot (containing the original, once-soaked fungus/herb mix) with the same amount of water, bring to boil, shut off, allow to steep and cool for 20 minutes.

4) Drink the second batch all at once as well. The first batch should be just kicking in now.

The next half hour will be very powerful, far more so than you'd get from eating the same dose. Just as this first wave levels out, the second glassful kicks in, bringing you up to a higher level. Altogether, it will quite likely be a stronger, somewhat briefer experience than you're accustomed to from mushrooms. Choose your dose accordingly, if you typically prefer 1/8 oz, go with 2g instead, if you typically prefer 2g, try a little more than 1. One time I made a pot for 5 folks, using a quarter ounce. Turns out no-one else wanted more than a small cup so I wound up drinking half the pot. Oh, my. Turns out they were a rather weak strain, so it didn’t last very long, but during the peak I did experience the strongest visuals and heaviest body load of my fungal career, so to speak."	t5_2qszq	True

I ended up walking around in the woods barefoot talking about trees, absolute truth, oneness, and all that music.

The most important thing I learned from the experience was that I should try to be more like a tree. Trees continue to produce oxygen for everything else on earth, regardless of their personal problems. I need to remember that no matter how bad I feel about my own situation, I always have something important to offer everybody in my life and should never forget what I mean to those people.

After the trip ended I felt so clear in my head like I haven't in years. It was probably the greatest day of my life. I learned so much without opening a single book."	t5_2qszq	True

I embarked with a few intentions: to untangle, to confide in, to allow the work to be done. I did not go alone. My fellow traveller embarked with me. Followed on the path for the first few turns. Then as staring into the night sky our paths drifted from each other, a thin slice of universe was between us, and yet not between us. Accomplishing our own endeavours on different paths, yet wholly together. I discovered what I will think of as the most important morsel of morsel of wisdom for my existence: you cannot take love, you can only receive it. The love that you are given is a free gift from your lovers. They do not give expecting any gifts in return, they give because they want their love to be in you. Because you are a gift to them already. I do not do justice to my lovers when I feel that I have taken their love. As if it was mine to take. I believe the way of returning their gift, to do it justice, is allowing the motions of their passions to dance in you, to play a joyful game on your soul. Let the love to be beautiful in you. The more love you let in, the more wild the rhythm becomes. The rhythm moves me, grabs all the pieces of my soul that have been broken apart from each other and places them perfectly back together. I am made from the gifts from my lovers. I am love.	t5_2qszq	True
1349596917.0	112x4d	A warning, bad trip last night, almost killed my wife.	UristUrist	27	10	35	"Not sure if there's a point to this post, but just a warning to those that want to underestimate this drug.

Yesterday I didn't feel like eating mushrooms because the thought of it made me feel sick (can't get over that taste), however, the last flight of mushrooms from my kit that I had purchased some months before was in my fridge ready to go off and I didn't want to waste them.

I read up on how to make a tea out of them, and so I did.

I think I went completely wrong here, because I took the entire box I had them in (could be anywhere from 75 to 125g, fresh) and put them in a food processor, then I added boiling water for about 10 minutes, added 1/4th of a tablespoon of lime juice (the cocktail stuff you can buy) and a apple cinnamon tea bag in a cup. I strained the mushroom juice through a coffee filter into the cup and drank the lot.

It all started okay....however, I soon found myself where I had been a few times before while tripping. Everything turns into a big deja-vu and a certain mystery of the universe appears to be lifted in front of my eyes and I realize I'm actually a playbeing of some sort of god and the world around me is just a figment of my imagination, the reason I take shrooms, in my head, is actually to break free from this god and the last couple of times I've taken shrooms I have felt exactly this way.

This time however, after awhile, I must have blacked out(as in, I was still doing things, I just had no control anymore and I can't remember them). I ended up going to bed and because I thought my wife was fake anyway and she'd be fine no matter what I was doing to her, I was hurting her and kicking her and trying to break her fingers and strangling her because - in my head - I thought there was no consequence anyway because I thought after the shrooms would work out, this god would just put me back in this simulation and she'd be fine again....

unfortunately, I woke up to a destroyed bedroom, alone, with piss all over the place (I had pissed the bed) and my wife frightened of me as I found her in a different bedroom(first thing I did was go search for her as I was pretty scared of having actually killed her...).

Hopefully she forgives me and I will never do this type of drugs again.

Just my little story, maybe it can serve as a warning to anyone, if anyone bothers to read it. Sorry for my poor writing skills."	t5_2qszq	True

1343670927.0	xegwh	Cubensis Iced Tea (w/pics)	energyinmotion	17	1	8	"If anyone wants to try this absolutely amazing recipe here is exactly what I used:

Iced Tea:
-21 grams to 28 grams dried Psilocybe
Cubensis mushrooms (at a minimum of
21 grams.)
-2 whole lemons (vitamin c)
-1 whole ginger root (for nausea)
-2 whole bunches of fresh mint leaves
(for that fresh herbal taste)
-8 tea bags of ""good earth"" brand tea
(flavor is up to you, as the tea merely provides flavor, and nothing more.)
-1/4th bottle of honey
-10 cups of water

1.) Pour 10 cups of water into the biggest pot you have.
2.) Set to high heat and bring to a boil.
3.) Once boiling, add in all of the mint leaves, and the peeled and coarsely chopped ginger.
4.) After approximately 7-10 minutes bring the heat to Medium/Medium-High, then place the 8 tea bags of your choice into the pot. Let it sit for another 10 minutes, occasionally stirring.
5.) Now, taste the tea, and add as much honey as you desire. Remember, the whole point is to make this as delicious as possible!
6.) Once taste level has been reached, set the heat to Low/Medium-Low heat, then add 1 &amp;1/2 , chopped lemons, AFTER squeezing all the juice into the pot!
7.) Add at least 21 grams of the dried cubensis mushrooms while stirring on low heat.

8.) Place the lid on the pot and let sit, occasionally stirring every few minutes. Do this for about 10-15 minutes, maybe more. Wait until the mushrooms become an almost transluscent-like (idk how else to describe it) color &amp; the mint leaves are no longer green, but are brown.

9.) Remove the pot from heat, let it sit and cool down for about 15-20 minutes. Strain everything out and throw it away. (Trust me, you will not need to eat the mushroom flesh.)

10.) Using a clean funnel, find the biggest plastic bottle (ie. water bottle, 2 liter soda bottle, Gatorade bottle, any plastic bottle that's been washed, rinsed, or cleaned out properly)
and then bottle your mystical, magical iced tea!

11.) Place it in the fridge and let it get ice cold. Make sure to protect it from unsuspecting fridge raiders!

----------------------------------------

What good is a tea party without something to snack on?

Sesame Honey Balls:

-7-8 grams dried cubensis mushrooms
-1 bag of at least 40 grams worth of whole sesame seeds
-Bottled honey

1.) In a blender, pulverize all 8 grams of the shrooms, and double the amount of sesame seeds, pulverize until fine powder.

2.) Pour mixture into a bowl and integrate and mix the seed powder and shroom powder until it's very indistinguishable. Pulverize more sesame seeds if needed.

3.) Add honey and mix with spoon to achieve a dough/clay-like consistency.

4.) Hand roll and press into little balls.

5.) Roll the sesame balls into a pile of the whole sesame seeds.

6.) Repeat steps 4-5 until done.

7.) Place in a tight Tupperware container and refrigerate alongside the tea.


The tea and the sesame balls should each serve 8 people. 

Each person will be consuming approximately 5 grams worth of Psilocybe Cubensis. Sit back and enjoy on an empty stomach.

Do not try and hold on to reality, just let it slip away and enjoy the ride.

Have a nice trip! :)

I started my psychedelic exploration with mushrooms. I know we all agree how life changing shrooms can be, especially for someone who is ready. I usually consumed 2-4 grams, never more. 

Then I discovered LSD and she blew my brains big time. I strictly tripped acid for maybe a few months and then decided one night to eat a solid 7 grams of shrooms with my cousin. He certainly tripped while I was left with a slightly increased amount of energy and enlarged pupils, nothing more. I wasn't too disappointed but I had missed my old friend and he didn't come back. Long story short, I've tried several times, on very high doses, and my shroom pal wont come back. I experience mild effects at best.  Also, I've always been with at least one other friend who tripped so I know the shrooms arent unusually weak. It's to the point where I feel it's a waste of drugs to trip on shrooms :( 

Thoughts?

Tl; dr Since I started tripping acid, even high doses (7-15 grams) of shrooms have little or no effect on me. "	t5_2qszq	True

Do not eat 7 grams expecting a similar effect if you are inexperienced with this substance. Mushrooms are powerful and I have been lost and separated from my body for hours on a dose half this size.* Be careful and always use caution and best judgement*




When I ate 7gs I initially felt relatively normal some subtle visuals kicked in first, I remember looking at the grass and saying ""wow if you shrunk me down I could run around in there like Alice in wonderland"" it literally looked like wonderland does. I also cried staring at the beautiful formation of clouds around the setting sun. I then traveled back to my apartment with my group of friends. I started to have some negative emotions and I found myself getting really frustrated with everyone due to them doing different things inefficiently, in my opinion. I made everyone sit down while I got everything that needed to be done, done. (Setting up the hookah, putting on some music, getting refreshments) I felt really angry and annoyed and kept repeating ""life is hard"" over and over. I then separated myself to listen to music and calm down. This is where it got crazy. I put in headphones and sat on the kitchen floor and closed my eyes. HOLY SHIT. When I closed my eyes I went to a completely different world, there were strange colorful striped creatures crawling towards me, all kinds of completely unnatural things that freaked me out so bad I couldn't keep my eyes closed. I switched back and forth between keeping my eyes open and closing them for a while, while listening to some random edm pandora station. (I like edm in those instances because I don't feel like it imposes an emotion upon me, simply allows my mind to wander to the flow of the music.)

I somehow managed to calm my frustration and anger from earlier and rejoined the group, they were leaving to the store real quick to buy some cigarettes or something.

The trip changed again here. I started watching my favorite show Community. Took a hit or two from my bubbler and I ended up crying due to a moving and emotional scene in the show. I believed I had an epiphany about what the show was really written about at its core, this is also when I decided that Community was my favorite show of all time. Also some crazy visuals were going on while I was watching the show, everything in it seemed to be something between real life and a Jimmy neutron style cartoon, there were spinning wheels and crazy stuff going on in the back grounds of every scene that reminded me of a really happy carnival. And everyone seemed to pop out from the screen in ultra definition.

Anyways...

 From this point forward the best word to describe my being was understanding. I understood everything. I knew what people were thinking, why they were upset, I could predict what people were going to say. I felt like a god. Honestly this was one of the most insane and inexplainable feelings of my entire life. One of my friends was suffering a full on ego death in the other room and I some how knew and fixed him by telling him absolutely everything I knew about him and his life without him asking. I handed people things they were looking for without them saying anything. It was crazy. I was also a lot happier than I had been earlier in the trip. This trip lasted 8-9 hours total (my longest shroom trip.) It was the craziest drug experience I've ever had and this recollection doesn't really grasp the entirety of it. 

I apologize for the lack of intense description of certain elements, it has been several months since this trip. 

Also just an ad on, that was probably the last time I really plan on doing shrooms, not because it was bad or anything. I've just done then several times, and I much prefer lsd and the way it makes me feel and see and all that other good stuff.

We parked next to a very large park in our town, and started going for a walk while I played pink Floyd from my phone out loud. 

About 15 minutes in we were all definitely feeling something, a similar feeling to being high. 

At around 25 minutes in we decided to lay on a small bridge off the trail, looking up at some trees. The trees looked fucking beautiful, and we opened a small bag of pretzel sticks I had brought with me (I brought 3 bags total) to eat which we delicious. 

We were laying there for about 25 minutes and then a track team ran by us and said hi. We took this as a signal to get up and keep walking. We were on a grass trail now (1:30ish) and my friend asked us if we wanted to smoke. We all agreed to let the shrooms carry us on for another hour and that we would smoke at 2:30. 

We laid on the grass and looked up the sky and watched a plane fly by. I’ll never forget that sight because it was the most beautiful thing we’ve ever seen I actually started crying from it. We opened another bag of pretzel sticks which felt like it took us an eternity to eat. (We would keep reaching our hands in the bag and think that more pretzels had just appeared). 

2:30 rolled around and we rolled two joints with the dub we had brought and smoked them. Nothing even felt real at this point while I was smoking. After we finished I decided to put my head phones and blast some more pink Floyd. 

I closed my eyes and laid down where I had awesome closed eye hallucinations of being in a room that was turning different colors and textures depending on what the music was doing. It was like I could see the music in my head, truly an awesome experience. 

I opened my eyes and took my headphones out and started talking to my one friend, (the other had found the tanning goggles in my bag and was going on about how pretty the sun looked with them on). While talking to him everything started to turn black and white, and then sepia colored. It was pretty cool; we also discovered the third bag of pretzels and were ecstatic with joy. 

It’s about 4:00 now and we were still lying in the middle of the grass, I decided to take a walk by myself with my headphones in. During that walk I thought a lot about my life and all the choices I’ve made, I thought about my future too and realized that I’m perfectly okay with myself and I don’t have any regrets. I went deep inside my conscious and at some points it was scary but I felt like I had to keep going. 

I came back around 4:30 to my friends still laying there. I was getting a phone call from three of my friends who knew  was doing shrooms at the time and wanted to come visit, so I sent them a picture of my Google map coordinates and they found us. We talked for a while but when they came I felt like some of the magic was wearing off. 

We started walking back to the car a little after 5:00ish, and one of my sober friends drove my car home for me. I took a shower which really helped me sober up (Around 5:30ish) but I still felt a little loopy for like another hour after which is when I think everything finally wore off. 

Overall it was an amazing experience that I will never forget, and hopefully will get to experience again in a couple months."	t5_2qszq	True

Here I am, on this beautiful sunday, early in the morning - 12:26am to be exact. It is March third 2013, and I AM SO INCREDIBLY HAPPY!!!! I have the most amazing boyfriend in the world. who loves me for who i am, what i look like, whether i just woke up with an aweful hangover looking like dog shit, or after just having spent hours pampering myself for. He loves me no matter what. How could I not be any happier, I could end it just at that! But I have so much more in my life that makes me that much more happy. I have an amazing family, that despite not agreeing with my choices because i don't agree with theirs, they still love me no matter what. I will always be my mother and fathers daughter, and sister to my 5 beautiful, talented, generous, kind, educated... I could go on and on. My sisters are more than amazing. They're there for me when I need them most, they're there for me even if I haven't talked to them in the last six months. I am so lucky to say that I have 5 best friends that I can also call my sisters. I'm so thankful for my family and for bringing me up in this yes, very scary world... but beautiful, big, opening, soul-searching world.
Draco names have been changed as to not identify OP and I split a magic chocolate about 4 hours ago. We started Despical Me and waited for the mushrooms to hit. About a half hour later, the color on the tv is spilling onto the walls, and I could feel myself sinking into the couch. I knew the mushrooms had taken into effect. Now here I am, listening to Stevie Nicks, while Draco plays his games and I am reflecting on my life. I love my life. I would change nothing about it. And if I wanted to, I know that it's all up to me. I am free to do whatever I want to do with my life, because only I control it.
It took me a while to realize that only I had control over my life. Tonight is actually the night that I realized that. Tonight is the night that I finally broke free from the grasps of the Mormon church. For years I have been living under a constant fear, of as cheesy as this might sound to you, being thrown into the depths of firey hell for not meeting some ''higher beings'' standards. I had been told my entire life that if I don't live the outlined plan of the Mormon church's way of life, that I would go no where in life. I would not receive ''blessings'' and advance in my life, and most importantly, I was told I COULD NOT BE HAPPY. Who the hell are they to tell me that I can't be happy without their god and controlling religion stuffed down my throat. HOW .. how could I be happy, that way? not having a mind to think for my own, and if I did - god help me, I better feel guilty about it. Cause if I don't feel guilty about it, then I can't truly feel sorry and ''repent'' and return to him, and be with my FAMILY.
This is probably my fifth or sixth time eating mushrooms. Tonight is the very first night I ate mushrooms and did not have a bad trip. Tonight was the first time tripping, that I realized no god is going to freeze my state of mind into that of eating shrooms, and leave me in that state of mind, until i was truly remorse and asked for repentance and swear that i'll be good and go to church and never eat shrooms again, just give me back normal reception of reality. Every other time I ate mushrooms, I would end up in that exact bad trip, because I would feel guilty for eating mushrooms. I would torture myself into thinking that this was gods punishment on me, and that i won't come back to reality until i accept him and apologize. But, as of tonight - no more!! Because there is no god that is controlling my life and deciding on whether or not my last thought of sucking a dick is going to keep me from being happy. I AM HAPPY. I.AM.FREE!!!
tldr: I have control of my life. I am happy. I am free!"	t5_2qszq	True
1361727030.0	195114	My first experience	syouganai	17	1	12	"So it has been a while now since I first did shrooms. About 2 months. I know many of you see these experience stories and lots of people post them but I just thought that a few of you might enjoy to read mine like I enjoy reading yours. I took about half an eighth with my bf early afternoon on a Sunday. When it started kicking in we were watching arrested development and green trails of light started to appear behind people walking on screen. Soon it looked like my entire wall was becoming the tv and I couldn't  handle looking at it. I went to talk to my roommate who was sober and quickly came to the conclusion that he could not keep up with my conversation and I left to go back to my room. 

I got stuck in my head, for about 2 hours. At the time, I was just rolling around my bed restless, and felt timeless. This caused me to feel quite anxious but I managed. It was here that I figured out why it is called a ""trip."" When I closed my eyes I could still see in my mind. Was so bizarre. 

I dealt with these strange unexplainable visions in my head for a few hours until I reached a point where I could control my body and feel more connected so I got up and went back to my roommates room. He put on exogenesis symphony from Muse and it was fucking incredible. Those 3 tracks took me through every emotion and facet of my mind. I kept obsessing about things in my life...like my responsibility, my parents, and how I felt as if there were always checks in life that caught me before I could fall. I kept diving into this idea that there was more to my life than I could see normally.  Suddenly (of course this is in hindsight) I forgot that I was tripping and accepted the new reality as real. As I was listening to muse, I glanced at the clock and again my physical vision blurred as my mind took me elsewhere. I can't recall details of this part but I would snap back into lucidity and tell my roommate that I want to bring this back. Back to them. Back to the world. This new found truth that I had discovered. Part of that truth was an explanation on life...details evade me but I began thinking that I had ""woken"" up in this new reality. The new reality included this knowledge that our day to day lives were more controlled than we could possibly know...that there are cycles in life that are controlled outside of our knowledge. I dived further and further into music and tried to google a quote from my favorite series, Battlestar Galactica. ""Life has a melody Gaius. A rhythm of notes which become your existence once played in harmony with God's plan."" (Btw, I am atheist but this quote has always hit me hard. I love it. ) Anyway, I searched for this quote and as I was looking at the google results ...all of the links changed on their own. It was like the letters shifted into new words themselves and all of the search results were titles of all the songs that speak to my soul, so to speak. You know what I mean. 

Anyway soon after this, a group of friends came over. This is where I got really fucked up. Instead of reminding me I was on shrooms, they went along with my hallucinations/trip. I thought that all of us had ""woken"" up together but that I was the newest. Kinda like the matrix lol. We woke up with the knowledge that our world that we live in is not the whole picture...that everything is connected in cycles with each other and that while we are in the real world, we are controlled. I thought that we had escaped so to speak...that me and my group of friends were using this time to meet for something...something big. Everything has a beat and a rhythm. I began thinking that my whole life was just set up for me (I was looping this back to the ""checks"" that always caught me before I could fail in life) everything made sense. I was so excited to believe that I could throw my whole life away for this new one. I kept tapping my foot to a beat this entire time (all along the watch tower) and no matter what was playing in the background, everything gravitated towards this beat. We were connected. 

As I type this I can't put into words what this did to me. My comedown was depressing. My brain was exhausted. I was upset that my new found knowledge of how there is so much more to life was just suddenly...gone. To this day I keep obsessing over one specific part. It was when I was looking up the ""Life has a melody gaius."" I felt like taking shrooms let me plug into something bigger, and during that part of my trip, listening to Muse say ""when are we, what are we, where are we"" my physical vision would blur...to my roommates I would zone out and speak a little nonsense but I would snap back into reality and I told them several times... ""I wish I could bring this back.""

I wish I could remember what ""this"" was. All I know is at the time it felt like some sort of grand enlightenment. Maybe someday I will remember. "	t5_2qszq	True

1350377688.0	11k93k	I had my first trip in my life this weekend in Amsterdam. It was really different.	bpkkdms	20	2	9	"My friend and I went to Amsterdam this past weekend. It was my first time there and my friend's been there several times before. First day, we just smoked bunch of weed and lurked around. On our second day, we decided to eat the truffles. Mind you, none of us had ever eaten 'shrooms before in our lives. 


We woke up around 9AM in our hostel and had breakfast. We then rented bikes to go around the city for a couple hours. At around 1pm, we hit the local smart shop (where they sell truffles) and bought a brand that said ""Space Shuttle"" on it. 15 grams for 18 euros. It was the first in the list so we thought it shouldn't be that strong. We immediately split in half and ate that.


After we waited half an hour, nothing happened. Well that was disappointing but I didn't care too much. My friend got really pissed and he stormed into another shop. This time, the gentleman gave us something stronger called ""Atlantis"". 15 grams for 22 euros. We ate that one too. Waited ~20 minutes to see the effects. This is where things got a little out of control...


First, we felt like the pebble stones on the ground were moving. Then we both started laughing hysterically to anything and everything. We were extremely happy for a while. Then, the anxiety hit us pretty bad. I was constantly thinking that I got poisoned or showing severe allergic reaction to the mushroom. I had to get out of this situation, fast! I ran to the nearest fast food place and ordered fries. When I put that first fry in my mouth, I must have chewed it close to 5 minutes without successfully swallowing it. Later, I had to spit it out. I was desperately thinking to call a doctor or go to the police. At that point, I was feeling extremely small like a dwarf or even smaller and everything was much much bigger than me. Luckily, my friend was not feeling that bad and he was trying to help me overcome the anxiety.


It took us (me) around 2 hours to get over the anxiety. During that, we occasionally had some laughs here and there, but mostly I was thinking if we can get on our train to Cologne. So, we walked to the train station and were there around 5:30pm. We had 1 hour to kill but none of us had energy to do something. Last time we had something to eat was 8 hours ago and had been walking non-stop. So we stood there almost like zombies. We did not talk much. At one point, my friend had to pee so we ""tried"" to get into the station and find a toilet. When we found the toilet, we were too scared to go in! So, we got out of there and felt lucky to be alive (I know it sounds dumb but really that was the feeling). Finally, 10 minutes before our departure, we held hands together ( both male) and found our train and wagon and hop on it. 


The train ride was very calm. We talked non stop for 1.5 hours before a switch in my brain literally turned off. I was ""awake"" again and no more thoughts were rushing to my head. Everything seemed clear and silent. My friend experienced a similar wakening 5-10 minutes after than me.

1344369786.0	xu9he	Last night, I became nature itself.	acdcfreak	19	4	8	"Something fucking amazing just happened, here I go. (I was on a 3 of the shromz)

2:20 am. I'm walking my bike up to my shed. I turn around and this cat that I had seen a few hours ago and had stopped to pet was behind me. 

It was a well fed black cat, with white paws. It had a collar. Its paws shined in the light.

He came up to me for more attention. I put my bike in the shed and turn around.

The cat is walking away, as if he wants me to follow him. I walk in the opposite direction, towards the door. Just as I'm about to go inside my house, I notice the cat had followed me. He mows at me. I stare back at him.

Without skipping a beat, he continues walking along the side of the house. Entranced, I begin to follow him. We started walking down my street. He kept looking back to make sure I was following him. Never had I ever felt like an animal was communicating with me.

I kneel down to his level, and stare where he is staring in the middle of the street. It's as if he's searching for something. I think ""maybe he's lost his kittens."" Suddenly, I see a skunk. The skunk is just sniffing around. The cat notices him, but continues on.

At this point, I've been following this cat for about 5 houses down the street, in people's front laws, around their trees, inspecting what he was inspecting and following him, all the while feeling like I was being led by the cat. 

He looked in a sewer pipe, and then ran down a driveway. I kept following him, but he turned around and went back into the middle of the street. I joined him and stooped to his level. 

Suddenly, he ran towards a tree, and without even a slight hesitation climbed it and was on the first branch, about 9 or 10 feet off the ground. It continued to climb up and down the branches, and occasionally let out a meow.

At this point, I'm getting a little fed up with the cat. I'm in a stranger's front yard, with my arms held high and my head starring above at this cat that's climbing around in a tree, something I had never witnessed before. I decided it was time to go, but I had no idea how to say this to the cat. I literally looked him in the eye, and went ""five...four...three..."" and counted to zero. At this point, he came down to the lower branches and was obviously looking for the easiest way down.

My jaw dropped. I had literally just counted down to zero and made an animal come down from a tree. I kept following him around and I tried to grab him a few times, and finally he ran down the tree on his own. I join him in the middle of the street, and I look back towards my house.

What I see is this: A racoon, and three skunks, are all walking around/sniffing, at their own rhythm and pace. I was at one with nature. I bent over and picked up the cat. I started to walk up my street, towards my house.

As if by magic, within a few steps, all the animals had noticed me. They slowly began to part, as I walked up my street holding this cat I had just met in my hands. The cat remained so calm, and I felt like he was an orb of power guiding my back home. I laughed, a crazy yet quiet mushy laugh, as I walked up the street. I felt emotions I can't even describe today.

I put the cat down infront of my house, and he started to walk behind my neighbours house. This whole time, I had been thinking that I have to go to bed to get up for work tomorrow. The cat looked back at me one last time, and then disapeared into the backyard infront of my house. It was at this point that I went home."	t5_2qszq	True

As we passed the buildings, cars, and trees, and stepped into the field of grass and clear skies with big puffy white clouds all around, and a deep blue sky. It felt like a whole other place. It was cool by the buildings, but once we hit the field it was very hot due to the clear view of the sun. We proceed to walk to a pavillion and sit on the bench for roughly 1 1/2 hours.

Obviously drugs affect each brain diffferently, so I'm curious of anyone here at /r/shrooms will relate to some factors of my trip description. And I welcome everyone else to throw some description of their typical trip in the comments as well because I'm curious how it affects different brains and also just the way we try to attach words to the experience. 

*First of all, I've tripped a handful of times with doses ranging from .8g to an 8th and every time I seem to hit a definitive point where I enter the trip. It's like an ON/OFF thing instead of a a ramp of getting higher until I peak and then coming down. I've heard the shroom trip described as a ""place"" that it feels like you are returning to every time you trip. That is very accurate to me. I hit a moment when I enter this ""place"". The intensity of the place is what varies with dosage, but I always get to that place - even with .8g. 

*The first word that always pops into my head to describe the place is ""simple"". Everything becomes much more simple to me. It's seems like there are less things in the world to think about and I can view everything as one simple thing with a wider view. 

*This one I have seen plenty of times but it is still a huge one. When I am tripping or ""in the place"" as I like to think of it, time doesn't work the way it does in reality or make sense the same way. Sometimes to me it seems like time isn't passing, I often feel like I'm going in cycles with my thought processes and occasionally I get anxious and want to leave the place because it feels like time isn't moving. 

*I don't like moving. When I am in a safe place that's comfortable I see know purpose in doing anything and am perfectly content just sitting with some music for my whole trips.

I'm getting tired but I may edit more in tomorrow. For now, let me know if any of these sound like things you've experienced and comment your experiences!"	t5_2qszq	True

I'm gonna see what I can write about this and try to follow up if you guys are interested. I'm curious to see the ups/downs of it.

I'll be eating an eighth that's in a chocolate. The set/setting will be kinda weird because I'm avoiding my family in the house a little bit. I'll probably stay in my room a lot.

1363554801.0	1ahfzv	First time	fistingtrees	18	2	3	"So I did shrooms for the first time this spring break. I was walking around a very small coastal town (Seaside, Florida, population of about 1200) with my two friends when they ran into someone they knew. We were all sober, looking for alcohol, and he was already really fucked up. So, we figured we should party with him. He took us to someone's condo, and we went upstairs to find everyone sitting in the bedroom. Keep in mind, me and my friends knew none of these people, and didnt even know whose house we were in. As we noticed someone with what looked like a small grinder, my friend asked if he had any weed. He said he didn't, but he said he did have shrooms. My friend turned to me, knowing that I had been interested in trying them for quite some time. I asked him how much, and he said he would give me 2 grams for $20 dollars, since he was trying to get rid of them. I'm not sure if this price was good or not, but I said fuck it, and bought them. The guy handed me a bag that was completely sealed on both ends, and I gave him $20. I was a bit suspicious at first, because the bag had mostly stems and 4 or 5 decent sized caps. I asked the guy about it, and he said that the stems would get me high too, and that I didn't have to just worry about the caps. Again, I'm new to this, and I'm still not sure if this is true either. He also commented that it wouldn't be a ""major hallucination"" high, but a primarily body high. After buying them, my friends and I left the house, and went back to the town. I decided I would do the shrooms the next day and just chill on the beach, as that's all there is to do in the daytime anyway. So that night, I slept in my shorts, with the shrooms still in my pocket, afraid that my mom or brother would find them if I took them out. When I woke up the next morning, before eating anything, I went in the bathroom and ate the shrooms, before I got in the shower. They tasted much better than I expected, with a very unique texture and consistency. After, I ate a bowl of cereal, and joined my friends at their house. I went up to their bedroom, and talked with them for awhile, before finally telling them I had taken the shrooms. After they judged me for eating them, I quickly felt the trip begin. I felt an intense, almost overwhelming sensation of happiness and warmth throughout my whole body. I looked down, and the wood floors and the bed appeared to be breathing. I tried describing this to my friends, but they just laughed. After about 30 more minutes, we decided to leave and meet with some sheltered girls who knew nothing about drugs, so I wouldn't be able to tell them I was tripping, without being judged. Once we got to the beach, I set out a towel and lay face down for hours, staring at the sand. I imagined people trekking through the tiny slopes formed in the sand. I thought about my life, and my future, and I felt as if I were literally bathing in the sun. This is how I spent almost all of the trip, the whole time feeling like I might be coming down. When I did come down, it was still very pleasant. All in all, it was a fantastic experience. The only thing I wish is that my friends had done it as well, but perhaps another time.

So yeah, I just thought I would share my first trip here. It meant a lot to me when I experienced it, but just hearing about it, it probably sounds stupid haha. I would love to hear what you guys think!



TL;DR: Did shrooms for the first time, stared at sand for hours.

4 Teens leaving soon, 

On a trip of their lives,

Different backgrounds, stories, about to mix into a blur

One had a coma,

The other never had a dad,

Another lives a double life,

And I'm just trying to find myself

One last cheers, then digest the drug,

Wait for it to sink in, time moves like a slug

Objects begin to move and appear

Hallucinations sooth me and disappear 

I chase the dark thoughts away,

And welcome the peace,

Now I'm sailing away

I begin to wonder what's real and not,

A numbing feeling that it'll never stop,

I wake up, hours have passed...

Before: 
I am going to take 5g dried mushrooms alone. I have no human company but my two dogs should keep me from feeling lonely, should it matter. I have fasted and had plenty of water along with a little bit of caffeine to prevent headaches from withdrawal. I will be eating the mushrooms whole, and washing them down with a blend I have made of grapefruit juice, Neuro Bliss, coconut water, green tea, honey, and ginger root. I have some palo santo to light and meditate by while waiting for the trip to begin. I have also made an appropriate playlist of music to last throughout the experience. The weather is beautiful should I want to go out into nature, but the comfort of my home should provide a good setting. I realize that 5g is considered to be a strong dose, especially for a first trip, but I only have 5g and if I were to split it up I may not have the opportunity for a strong trip for quite some time. I can honestly say that I am not nervous at all. If this had been months or years ago I would most likely be nervous but that is no longer the case.
After: 
The mushrooms were much easier to eat plain than I had anticipated. I don’t understand the trouble some people have with it. They tasted earthy and plain. After eating them I drank a full glass of the drink that I made, and poured another for when I would get thirsty. I then dimmed the lights, turned on my music, and lit the palo santo. While waiting for the effects to begin I closed my eyes and meditated. I did not open them until I felt a strong body high starting to kick in. When I looked around the room everything still looked surprisingly normal, although this is probably not the correct word. I did not yet have any “visuals”, but the things around me seemed very strange. Objects that I had previously paid no attention to now seemed funny to me, and I couldn’t help but see faces and bodies in everything, much like cloud gazing. The next visual step was the colors. The smoke from the palo santo, as well as everything else, had a rainbow sheen to it. Once I closed my eyes again I saw round geometric formations. They smooth and round with crevices that seemed very vaginal in nature. The patterns mostly resembled that colors and shapes found in traditional Mexican art. Before I knew it I had almost no filter for my thoughts. As time passed (and it seemed to pass very quickly) anything I could ponder became extremely clear to me, with almost no effort. The knowledge however was not gained, so much as revealed. Anything I learned seemed to be information I already knew, but had been neglecting , ignoring, or I was just unaware of my the fact that it was there. Some things which I previously thought to be important issues to think about seemed silly, and I was ridiculing myself for not realizing this before. When my mind became extremely chatty I began to struggle to quiet it, and failed. I wanted to calm my mind and explore more deeply within, but I couldn’t stop the constant inner dialogue, although the English language soon proved itself to be very insufficient. I kept telling myself that during some other trip I would write, and to simply witness this first one, but I repeatedly failed to stop this, so I accepted it and continued to converse with myself. 
	After a while my dogs needed to go outside so I stood up, finding physical coordination to be easier than expected. I went outside to my backyard and was immediately overcome by an overwhelming euphoria from the warmth of the sun and the beauty of the plant and animal life. I sat in the grass, and explored my new perspective on nature. All butterflies, moths, bees, flies, and other insects seemed to be highlighted and my attention was directed to them, as if my eyes were magnetized to life. When petting my dogs they seemed to be stuffed animals, but hollow on the inside except for a spirit that was, although less capable in some senses, no less significant than my own. Rain soon started to fall, and I adored this sensation, along with the thunder that accompanied it. None of this affected my mood and I was capable of appreciating its beauty.
	When I returned inside my house, the air conditioning, music, low light, and the scent of the palo santo transformed what was once simply my house into a sanctuary. I found myself appreciating the natural colors of my home, like the browns and greens, more than any others. When I sat down and covered myself with a blanket which proved to be a physical ecstasy, the inner dialogue resumed at full strength. I felt a strong desire to express myself through music, drawing, painting, and writing, but decided that if I gave into such impulses so easily my time would be divided so thinly that none of the above would be given due attention, so I put them all off for other trips, which I would go into with the specific intent of doing any of those. The overwhelming emotion that I felt for myself and all others in my life was love. When I say love I don’t mean it in the decorated advertised way that it has been developed in our culture, but instead a pure, simple, yet powerful feeling. I also made the conscious decision to ponder death, as I still felt very secure with my own mind. I probably thought about death for a half hour, meditating on the idea and even envisioning myself dying. None of this seemed the least bit frightening. It was a concept equally as beautiful to me as life, and I thought of it as an event to celebrate just as one would celebrate a birth. Throughout the entire experience the most prominent message that I couldn’t avoid was a responsibility and obligation to show others. The idea of being selfish with this state of consciousness and keeping it to myself filled me with a sense of guilt. Through this idea I immediately understood how easily prophets came to be. Hording money, food, clothing, or shelter, could not compare to the darkness of not sharing this illumination with others.
	As I found myself peaking, I had still felt no nausea, and no terror. The visuals were also still mild and I often wondered why five grams is considered to be a strong dose. I am confident I could handle more. I never experienced an OBE. I did not expect to, but it is worth noting that I remained firmly in this dimension. When I closed my eyes I still had visuals but the light that penetrated my eyelids was still disruptive, and when I put my hands over my eyelids this visuals became much more pure, like peering into space. I decided once again, to try this during another trip, with a blindfold, and perhaps hearing deprivation as well. Throughout my trip I felt a strong, warm pressure, in the back of my head. It did not feel painful and I mostly ignored it, although after my trip I had a migraine, which may be what this was. 
	While my trip was still strong I suddenly felt myself compelled to something that I had not at all planned on. I somehow managed to turn on my TV and PS3, and started playing the game Journey. I have no doubt in my mind that this game was specifically designed for use with mushrooms and the combination of the two provided an extremely powerful and beautiful experience to which I cannot possibly give just praise through writing. I strongly recommend anybody to try this. The game is simple and short, and its name describes it perfectly. This was one of the most beautiful experiences I have ever had in my life. 
	When I felt myself starting to come down I took a shower, which was surprisingly normal. During the entire trip I felt sad that the majority of my existence is spent in such a simple mindset, and did not wish to return to it so quickly. When I was once again sober, I felt down and disappointed with my ape-like, problem solving, sober consciousness. Nothing that I normally do to keep myself busy appealed to me in the least and I was very bored, although I had no desire to reflect on my trip. It was as if my brain was exhausted and needed to recharge. I went to sleep early, and when I woke up in the morning, despite the migraine, I felt emotionally great. Everything seemed beautiful and I could recall my trip with clarity, which was a very difficult task the night before.  As the day went on I found myself recalling more and more of it. Overall the trip was extremely positive.

1376167181.0	1k3v7d	My first trip - the good, the bad, and the kitten.	HateWinslet	15	0	5	"1. I laid on my back on my enclosed balcony and watched the clouds roll by, listening to [Copland's suite from ""The Tender Land""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLVyRvp2Qbg). If you listen all the way through, it will not disappoint. The clouds were these infinitely cascading fractals with pale rainbow edges that sort of dissolved and swirled like paint. The bigger clouds had really big facets. This went on for about an hour or so. It was truly magnificent and I hope I never forget it.

2. I stood up and felt somewhat separated from my body. It was difficult to control it - I felt more like a pilot controlling a clumsy machine than a person. This continued throughout the trip and became a bit of a problem later on.

3. I stood and watched the dusk fall. My balcony faces east towards lake Michigan, and lots of planes fly in from that direction. They left a smear of color in the sky behind them. The birds were going to roost. There were so fucking many of them! I couldn't tell if I was hallucinating the birds, or if I really missed this spectacular show every night. They were swooping and chasing each other. This, in front of the backdrop of the neon fractal clouds, was incredible.

4. This is when I started feeling really melancholy about the futility of life. I was growing increasingly angry at how limited my body was. I kept thinking about how depressingly brief and fragile human life is - there are infinite beautiful things to see and hear and touch and experience emotionally, but we'll only experience a tiny fraction of those things before we die. This is something I'm often depressed about, but it was magnified during the trip.

5. I went inside and talked to my kitten. This is the most ridiculous and hilarious part of the trip to me. I leaned down, cradled her head in my hands, and whispered ""who were you before this?"" I also walked by her later and whispered ""don't be afraid to die"". I also felt like our other cat was really concerned about my current state of being, so I kept telling her not to worry so much. 

6. I really, really wanted to watch Breaking Bad. Don't ask me why. My internet had gone out earlier in the day, and my boyfriend (who is out of town) was supposed to call them to get it back up. It wasn't up. At this point, technology was very confusing - I didn't quite remember the differences between cable, internet, apple TV, and my phone. I texted my boyfriend and had to troubleshoot the modem while I was still on mushrooms.

7. Unfortunately, there is a full-length mirror in that room, and I caught a glance at myself in it. My neck went all rubbery and my head kind of slid off my shoulders. My arm also bent backwards. It was completely awful and terrifying, regardless of the fact that I knew it was a hallucination. I ran into the living room and things got real.

8. I sat on the couch and continued to feel sorry for myself - I was so frustrated about my limitations as a human in a body that I started punching my leg really hard. Understanding time was very difficult - I knew I'd be feeling better in a few hours, but I didn't know how long an hour feels. It was like if someone told me that I'd be feeling better in a few zeemons. What the fuck is a zeemon?

9. I finally managed to turn on the cable and felt instantly better - the temporal nature of television gave me something by which I could tell the passing of time. That was so comforting. Also, that Ken Burns National Parks documentary was on, and it's one of my favorite things to watch, period. So, good luck there!

The whole trip only lasted about 4 hours. I ate 3 grams. I eventually managed to order some food and went outside to talk to my neighbors. I don't really feel like this was a bad trip - it just very real at times. I don't think I was expecting the self-reflection aspect of it to be so brutal and emotional. I study Buddhism and attend a temple regularly, so it makes sense to me that my issues with impermanence would come to the forefront of my trip. 

I'm exhausted today and still a little foggy. I'm normally a good writer, but writing this was really difficult. No one has to comment - I just wanted to write a trip report while this is still fresh in my mind.

It probably makes no sense though. Everything is still really hazy. Skip to the third paragraph if you only want to read about my trip.

I tried shrooms for the first time last night. It all started out with me getting home and checking the mail. I had finally received my spore syringes. I texted my boyfriend and we freak out, this dream is really happening. Around 11 pm my boyfriend picks me up at my house. He had just come from prom, i didnt go because i knew that it was going to be super lame. We go to his friends house and start talking about what we need to do to prepare for the first grow. At his friends house there are three people. I knew two of them but there was also this other guy that i had never met before. The new guy hears us talking about the grow and picks up on what we are talking about (he used to grow too apparently). He says that he can hook my boyfriend and I up with shrooms.

I was ecstatic.

We agree to a more than fair price (35$ for 2 eighths and my boyfriend offered to smoke the guy out). We then leave the friends house and head over to my boyfriends. When we get there a group of people from our school are waiting for us. We go inside and get everyone situated. The bong is brought out and people start getting drinks. The dealer dude, my boyfriend, and I go upstairs to divide the shrooms and get started. The aborts come out first. We both eat a tiny pile of them and then eat the real mushrooms. The didnt taste that bad. Ill admit that i actually really liked the taste. We walk downstairs to join the rest of the party. There were people just chilling around the house kinda doing their own thing. It was a super chill environment and it put me at ease. We join some others on the patio to smoke some weed. I think I took like 3 hits of the bong. Smoking with people is my favorite thing to do. Its just really fun and we just get to laugh and enjoy the moment. The weed starts kicking in and my boyfriend and i cannot stop laughing.

We know that this is just the beginning.

After this point my memories are very hazy so bear with me while i try to explain what was going on. Everyone around me is talking and having a wonderful time. This is when i began feeling like an onlooker who is just observing this world. Another friend stops by and wants to show my boyfriend his car. It was red and thats all i remember. It was also really really nice. We agree to a plan, my boyfriend would go with this guy and go for a drive and i would stay at the house and watch the house. Based on the events that occur later in the night this might not have been such a good idea. The walls were shaking and i was seeing strange colors and patterns everywhere. Neon green, purple, and black were the colors that followed me where ever i went. I drifted around the house observing the world. This one girls eyes were so green that i asked her if she was wearing colored contacts. She wasnt. I eventually made it out to the patio again and sat down. It was super chill. I felt restless though. My mouth was dry and my heart was beating fast. I go to get water and whenever i would take a sip i felt like i was eating chunks of sand. Any repetitive noises would draw me in and begin pulling me deeper and deeper into the trip.

I really had to pee.

I walk towards the bathroom and my whole body is being tickled by the air. The hall to the bathroom was dark and when i walked through it i had tunnel vision. As a child i was always afraid of the dark. I rush into the bathroom and turn on the light, avoiding the mirror at all costs. When I go to wash my hands i sneak a peak at my reflection. There wasnt a monster looking back at me, it was just my normal reflection. I finish washing my hands and look at the mirror one more time. Everything was the same except for one thing.

My eyes.

The pupils were the size of my iris, only the slightest amount of green peaked through. I looked like a creature from another world. I freak out and get out of the bathroom as fast as i could. The patio was the only safe place. After what felt like eternity my boyfriend finally comes back. We walk towards eachother and theres this energy that i feel between us. It was almost like electricity. ""this is fucking insane"" i said to him. His face was veiled with geometric patterns and neon green and purple. We go back to the patio and as we sit there i begin to figure things out. I felt like i knew everyones real personality and for the most part the were all bad. I felt like i was looking into their souls and for once I finally knew who they really were. I was thirsty again so i went into the kitchen alone to get a drink.

Thats when things started to get out of control.

Something was drawing me deeper and deeper into my subconscious. I took a sip of water and felt like i was going to puke. I knew i t was all in my head but that was the problem. My head was controlling this whole thing so it could do whatever it wanted. I walk out to the patio and tell my boyfriend that i dont feel very good. Then i proceed to vomit on the patio floor. It was disgusting and everyone is telling me to go outside. I go and my boyfriend follows me. The grass is waving at me and chills run down my spine. I puke a few more times. My boyfriend is trying to assure me that i can control it but i keep telling him that i cant. 

It was the monster.

The monster that was living inside my soul. The monster knew that i could do whatever it wanted. It was controlling me and the rest of the universe. I tried explaining how I could not tell the difference between reality and my minds illusions. Then my reality was stuck in an endless loop. I was having the same sensation over and over again. The world was a cube and it kept on rotating, repeating the same visuals. It felt like it would never stop. I tried explaining how the monster would draw me in a tempt me. This entire world was just an illusion to reward me with if i did what it wanted. We decide t get out of the puke covered grass and go back onto the patio. As we sit there i hold my boyfriends hand as tight as i can. He was the only reason that i was stable during this whole thing. Theres two girls at the table that are so inviting and i feel like they know whats up. I try explaining the monster thing to one of them and she doesnt say much but she is able to put me at ease. The whole time i am at the table i am checking the time.

Time seemed to move alot slower than it usually would.

What was really three minutes felt like hours upon hours. I am mumbling to someone about the universe and how none of this was real. It was all i could think about. Each wave was pulling me deeper and all i could do was hold onto my boyfriends hand and never let go. He reminder me of a snake. His pupils were huge and his eyes were almost black. His skin also kept turning purple. He also reminded me of a doctor. He was helping me through this and try to make me understand what was happening.

I also couldnt imagine a world where i wasnt tripping.

I thought that my mind would stay like this forever. I didnt know what to do. I wanted to stay like this but i knew it would be too hard to please the monster. Everytime i talked it would be about the monster and when i talked about the monster my eyes were wide and i got this look on my face, my boyfriend said that it really scared him. But the thing is i wasnt scared. I was kinda content with what was going on, with the role of the monster in my life. I knew this was all crazy and it was just the chemicals affecting my brain in ways that i couldnt imagine but i liked what was happening. The rest of the night i just kinda space out and i feel like an onlooker again. I just watch what is going on and i feel disconnected from everything. I calm down from the trip and everything is hazy. Now all thats left is a body high instead of a mind-fuck. 

This is the longest thing i have ever typed. Wow. I feel like i understand but then at the same time it makes everything even more confusing. I think the world just cannot be comprehended and our mind just cannot grasp the concept of how everything fits together like little puzzle pieces, so when were tripping it tries to make sense of everything but it cant. The mind thinks it is the center of the universe an it cannot realize that it is not. We only know what we are thinking so it feels like we control the world and reality. But we dont. I'm sorry if none of this makes no sense whatsoever and i feel like i understand but i just cant put it into words.

TL;DR... uhhh yeah shrooms made me realize that the world is fucking insane and my subconscious controls everything."	t5_2qszq	True

On this trip I had a 15 second seizure as a result of my blood pressure getting to high. More on that later.

Let me preface by saying I am extremely experienced with shrooms. I had tripped at least 50 times prior to this night. I also prefer to trip alone, as I was this night I'm about to tell you about.

It was Easter night of 2012. I had just gotten back to my house that I rent while in college from visiting my parents. I was super excited to get home and trip. I was growing at the time and had 40 grams (wet) (bout 6 dry). I chopped them up into little pieces and soaked them in lemon juice for an hour. I took two nitrous oxide bodybuilding supplement capsules with a glass of water and then slammed the lemon juice and shrooms. 

All I can say is Holy Shit. I remember being in the shower when they hit after about 30-45 min. The shower curtain was doing waves with the different colors you always see. There was the most beautiful pattern and colors in the water drops on the walls of the shower. It looked like fools gold if that made sense. I probably stood under the stream of water for a good 20 minutes. Not that exciting. But let me tell you it felt amazing. 

I finally realize I've just been standing there and get out. I open the bathroom door and the steam billows out into the hallway. It was fuckin' magical. I probably had the dumbest grin on my face. I get dressed and go lay down on the couch and just take in the most dramatic visuals I've ever had. I could see faces in the shadows on the wall, and I remember thinking at a certain point that these faces I kept seeing were the people that had lived in the house before me. I felt judged yet forsaken. Just a weird fucking combination. Hence the term ""If these walls could talk they'd scream"" Thats how I would explain it. 

So anyways. One hour since trip began: 
I find myself walking around and just observing things. You know, admiring how light bounces off of things and finding everyday objects so beautiful and profound in said light. After that I go back to the couch and put on some fast paced music and just start dancing. 
Its safe to say at this point I have lost my ego and start to introspectively ponder the existence of life, reality just stuff like that.
I had this epiphany which if you don't want to read, skip past it. 

Take an orange tree for example. Lets say this orange tree has 100 oranges. Lets also say theres no animals or humans to take/eat any of those oranges. At the end of the growing season those oranges would fall off and decompose into the soil essentially 'recycling' 100 oranges worth of nutrients. Now lets say that humans come by and take all 100 oranges. Now, since theres no oranges to decompose the soil now has a nutritional deficit of 100 oranges. If you were to keep this cycle up, eventually the tree is going to start dropping leaves in an attempt to make up those nutrients and eventually it will die. My point? NATURE IS EFFICIENT. Now If you look around; the house you're living in, the computer you're using....everything that you see around you was made by manipulating the organic matter of the Earth- whether that be chemically of physically. Nature is the reason we're alive. Humans have lost respect for the Earth and we have been taking all of the oranges off the tree. Our demise, this planets demise will be a product of our own greed and oblivion. The future is going to be how can we create all this without taking all the oranges from the tree.  
Anyways, went ultra-hippie on y'all but I just felt like sharing.
Plus if you ever have the opportunity to pick an orange from the tree and eat it while sitting under the tree on shrooms, take it. It will bond you with nature on a scale I don't even have a metaphor for. That orange tree grows in my backyard. Life changing. anyways....

About 3:00 in at this point, I don't completely remember everything because my mind was just being melted.
 I am starting to peak-
And thats when I decide to go out to the garage.

The garage has plywood wall to wall and a flickering fluorescent light. Everything is dusty and theres sounds that just echoed and resonated in my ears that just made the room special. Anyways, Im sitting in the middle of the garage looking at all the ripples in the plywood that are morphing with yellows and reds rapidly. The occasional face or figure shows up in the patterns only to be folded back over by new waves of visuals. I have two grape swisher sweets and I sat there and smoked them back to back. I am not a tobacco person, I had them with the intention of rolling blunts but just decided to smoke them. Anyways I'm just walking around smoking on the blunt watching spiders silhouetted by the fluorescent light spin webs, just standing silently listening to the light flicker, the sounds outside and the tobacco burning and sizzling as I took a puff. Really fucking beautiful experience. The nicotine made me feel at ease and I was struck with a moment of clarity that I've never experienced.

I would have to say that that moment of clarity was the most euphoric moment I have ever experienced. I have always had this feeling while shrooming before. This feeling of ""you know what I mean"". The feeling that I could never explain yet felt I needed to tell about. In that moment I feel as if I finally understood that feeling and what it was/about. Yet, when I try to think back I am struck with the same barriers when trying to explain it.

Lets be clear. At this point I am tripping my fucking balls off. Usually I can handle it not a problem, but I was at the absolute threshold of my breaking point. My account of it seems tame because I'm sober telling the story. The trip itself was hectic and the contradictions I kept finding in reality were making me retarded. I don't know if that explains it well...in other words my complete view of reality was distorted and ripped apart and just laying on the ground. I'm not good enough with words to give you the actual account. 

Anyways I come inside and just stand there for a good 15 minutes watching the hardwood floor 'flow' and I go and turn on the TV
This was a mistake. I don't know why I did it but I did. This commercial starts playing for the ""No No hair remover"" This lady (who looked like a plastic doll with just an evil smirk) kept saying ""no no"". I just stood there chanting it. 

This is when I lost my fucking shit. 

I couldn't comprehend what I was saying and I started hyperventilating. Next thing I know there is a tingling sensation in the tips of my fingers and my hands seize up. I fell to the ground and started seizing. I remember not knowing what was happening. I closed my eyes and next thing I know, the seizure is over. 

When I opened my eyes, there was no color in anything. The room was just shades of gray. It almost seemed that the room was disintegrating. Like the walls were sand and just crumbling away. I remember sitting up and just staring at this empty chair. I literally thought I had died and was in an after life. 
about 20 minutes later I got up and just started running my hand over objects and finally made it to the sink where I took a drink of water. color had started to reappear, but I was still freaking out.

At that point I rapidly came down off the trip to a certain extent. I was trembling and shaking just blown away by what happened. I realized I had a seizure and just kept telling myself to snap out of it. It sobered me up to the point to where it didn't ruin the trip, I was just freaking out trying to figure out what I should do. Thats about all I can remember.

I got an MRI, no damage was done. The seizure was a result of my blood pressure being critically high.

The blood pressure was raised by the shrooms, the NO capsules, the tobacco smoking, and last but not least the hyperventilation. 

Upon research I realized that fresh shrooms also contain psilocin which is lost when the shrooms are dried. In other words I took 40 grams of fresh ultra potent shrooms. Twice as potent than if they had been dried.

That was my first mistake. The second was the Nitrous Oxide and the smoking.

As of today, I am healthy and doing good. I had no adverse psychological problems from this experience and I attribute that to my extensive experience with shrooms.

It didn't ruin shrooms for me, and I will probably trip again in the future.  But for the time being I have no desire to even consider doing it. I feel like it left me with profound knowledge that I have yet to realize. That night was extremely defining and life changing. I learned quite a bit from it. 

You don't need to take large doses to have good trips trust me

Peace and love, happy tripping, respect mother nature.





**EDIT:** Corrected my horrific grammar and spelling :)

Also added this paragraph:  
""I would have to say that that moment of clarity was the most euphoric moment I have ever experienced. I have always had this feeling while shrooming before. This feeling of ""you know what I mean"". The feeling that I could never explain yet felt I needed to tell about. In that moment I feel as if I finally understood that feeling and what it was/about. Yet, when I try to think back I am struck with the same barriers when trying to explain it.""
(Near the center)

And this sentence:
""I feel like it left me with profound knowledge that I have yet to realize."" 
(In the last paragraph)

1348078300.0	105bbf	3 tips to guarantee a good trip!!!	patricksip	16	2	3	"first of all, set and setting is key, shroom outdoors, in a big open place, with as few ""sober"" people around as possible. All of the bad trips I've ever heard almost always start off with the people being indoors. 
Once you start your trip remember these three tips: they sound futile and simple but during the course of all of my shroom trips they've really saved me.

1. Remember that you are on shrooms, whatever you experience is because you are on shrooms, and not really real.

2. Remember it will end.

3. Relaxe and have fun!!

Keep expanding your mind!"	t5_2qszq	True
1346741698.0	zbpos	My first experience on shrooms. Amazing.	ItzFrenchDon	16	4	2	"So it was my first time ever tripping shrooms and my buddy and I both took an eighth mixed in OJ and boy did I not know what I was in for.  Some background on me, I have smoked weed heavily for 4 years now (only 18 now) and never used any other drugs besides a few painkillers here and there.  We took the shrooms around 12:30 and went on a bike ride to the Arboretum(a tree conservatory).  Around an hour later or earlier we found a spot to sit and let the trip begin.  

My surroundings were all changing before my eyes.  People were scary to me and noises were much louder, colors were more vivid, and things seemed to be much closer than they actually were.  Turkeys in the distance looked like egyptian hieroglyphs in 3D. I remember looking up at the trees and the leaves were all conforming to make a kaleidoscope effect and thats when I knew the shrooms were working.  Then I looked at my limbs and the hair on my legs were waving and my body was like glowing purple kind of like a blacklight but not overwhelming glow, a pretty subtle glow.  I remember standing up to check on my friend throwing up because he seemed to of disappeared and I felt like a giant.  All the crevices in my skin seemed to stand out more and my fingers and toes looked more alien like.  Then I looked over at a group of trees and the leaves were red, yellow, pink, green, and the bark on the tree in the foreground looked like it was drawn and it started to move slowly toward me.  It looked almost like an Alice in Wonderland scene.  I looked at my friend and his eyes were glowing with color and kind of morphing as well.  We tried to smoke some weed to relax our stomachs and the trip but packing the bowl and lighting it seemed almost impossible.  I also was getting the weirdest thoughts in my head like I was on another planet and that time was irrelevant. Patterns started swirling around the grass like a disco bulb and my friend and I decided to go biking to the zoo.  First we went inside the Arboretum building to get some water the stained glass on the door looked like it was moving like matrix like designs and dribbled onto the floor.  I tried filling up my water but got too freaked out by the people around me and bolted out of the building.  Then things started to get crazy. 

 My friend and I started biking and I started thinking I was in a dream and my friend kind of became a stranger to me.  I kept repeating names and some stupid shit and he started tripping out and was kind of afraid since I was unresponsive to his questions.  For some reason I couldnt express my thoughts to him because I couldn't remember exactly who he was.  I thought that I randomly biked up to him and started bugging him so I was really confused.  For some reason I started thinking that I needed a dog or a girl to be with me and the next time I want to trip I need to be with a girl.  But then I started thinking that vaginas and dicks were the same thing and I couldnt help but thinking about my bed.  

I randomly asked my friend if I was gay because in my head again I was thinking that a vagina was a penis. He tried convincing me that I wasnt gay but I kept thinking that dicks were vaginas. Thats when he seriously started having a bad trip and then I thought that he was a butch lesbian and that we were growing old together. I also called out a bunch of different names at him because I couldnt remember who he was. I was also convinced I was a hippie and that I was getting really old.  Once we arrived to the zoo we didn't park out bikes and I was just riding my bike through the zoo like an asshole even though my friend told me to get off my bike.  I just had no control over my actions or emotions and I was thinking very irrationally.  Even though all of this was happening I still had a great time.  We saw some Polar Bears, Giraffes, and Hippos where apparently I tried to climb over the hippo barrier to try and free them.  Once we finally got back to my friends place shit started getting strange.  I thought that his bed was my bed and I started talking to the pillow.  I also got some thoughts that I was invincible that heights weren't real that I could jump off the balcony and be ok.  Thankfully I shook those thoughts off and didn't jump.  
Once things started calming down I was blown away by my experience and wanted to trip again.  My friend was pretty bugged out by me because I was acting like a madman and he thought I was gay.  Keep in mind this was my first time tripping and my friend was pretty experienced but wasn't ready for the insanity that ensued.  

All in all I had an amazing, life changing time. I came back to my room blown away by the experience I had and felt like tripping as soon as possible. I do forget a lot of things I said and saw, kind of like blacking out, hence why I was so uncontrollable.  I think next time I will ease into the dose, like half eighth then take the other half.  Definitely need to trip with a girl next time so I can be affectionate. Ever since I took the shrooms I have been more confident and feel like I have a different perspective on all my actions. Just had to write my experience down because it was truly mind blowing.  "	t5_2qszq	True

The experience was quite frightening yet it had its moments of profound beauty. I basically felt the whole universe flow through me and I followed fractal patterns deep into this whole zone of mystery. I cant even explain. I feel like it was a spiritual awakening. I felt as if I experienced death and rebirth.

A bit of back ground. I am a sufferer from anxiety, and I though the shrooms would help me push through my fears. Well it partially did. I found throught the most of the trip I was very tense and panicky all over, I still dont know what to make of it. I have only had like 2 hours of sleep since. The insomnia was a pain. But I am telling you, it was like it fine tuned my senses or something. I feel like my brain has been rewired.

A few questions.

Is it normal to feel pressure in the head after the trip? Its kinda like this fuzzy feeling, not really here. Kinda gives me a head ache to type or do things that require lots of mental energy.

I've been doing quite a bit of research, and I feel that this experience could really help me to open up my mind and help me connect with myself more fully on a personal, spiritual, emotional, and mental level.
That said, I should note that I have never used (nor do I plan to use) other substances save for alcohol - I drink beer on a regular basis, but I rarely get drunk.  With that in mind, I really have no clue what I should even remotely expect from a first-hand point-of-view.
I'm not doing this just to have some giggles and good feels.  For me, like I said, it will be for the importance of Knowing Myself.  I'm considering taking around 3 - 3.5g, though I'm open to advice in that regard.  
Also, I don't think really any of my close friends would be interested at all in embarking on this endeavor with me.  Is there any reason I wouldn't be alright on my own?
I'd like to find some place outside, as my apartment is total ass and does not give me any sort of good or comfortable feeling while I'm sober, let alone in any other state of mind.  I've got a nice playlist worked out with some Tool, The Mars Volta, Muse, and a touch of Floyd - and I'd probably take something that I could use to write or draw as the opportunity arises.

1346261867.0	z12vq	my first trip story (about 1 year ago)	airbrush_wizard	14	2	1	So one day me and 3 friends decided to take some shrooms. One of my friends was a pro at them lol because he has done them plenty of times. I was nervous because i did not know what  to expect. So i ate about 1.5 grams. Sitting there waiting i ate about 2 caps more and chewed on a stem. At that point about 30 min later i felt a huge wave of heat take me over. I knew it was time to ride. I looked at everyone in the room and  they looked at me and we laughed like we never have for literally 20 minutes. i tried to draw but when the sharpie hit the paper it had a ghost trail next to it basically tracing my lines but 1 inch away. I decided to take my friends seat who just got up. he came back and wanted his seat and i didnt wanna get up because it was super comfy. So i got up and was like SHIT i need a new seat, so i go to my side of the apartment to get a chair. I am alone at this point and im feeling very strange. I said to myself i need to lay down. I layed down closed my eyes, and then EVERY single type of alien face ever seen flashed before me like a flip book. I encountered every imaginable variation of a E.T face. Then it flipped to interweaving patterns of color going from left to right in a 45 degree motion. I see flying totem poles and diamond shaped patters all interconnecting together in a mesh of insanity. I open my eyes and said holy shittttt, so i went to play some music as i was feeling kinda scared. The first song that was on when i turned the radio on was Geto Boys- My mind is playing tricks on me. I began to say  fuck mee the radio knows my state and is telling me its cool bro, chill on and enjoy the ride. I then said fuck it and switched to some upbeat techno to maybe change the feel. The bass was talking to me and i could not believe it. At this point i went back over to the other side to get back into the feel good area as i was kinda buggin. Got back and i felt at ease. I sat down and literally just began to laugh again for soooo long. we looked at visuals on the computer for house before i had to pee. I told myself i was not gonna look into the mirror, but i did. I stared deep into my pupils and i felt as if i did not exist. I was looking through the eyes of a man i did not recognize. that lasted for 20 minutes before i could reel myself back to reality. We smoked some herb and the waves came back full force. i closed my eyes again, and was greeted by a speck of white light, far in the distance, as i became aware  i traveled closer and closer untill i felt i should not go any further. I did not know if it was me rising to my death or my chanc to experience another world of infinite information. That pretty much sums up my first .

1376213078.0	1k4y3k	First Time Trip Report - 1.75g Shroom Tea	SevenSeasOfRhye	14	3	9	"So I have been researching shrooms for the past 6 months thinking about trying them. A week ago I said fuck it, and acquired shrooms. Today, I made shroom tea with 1.75g of liberty caps I think they're called? Drank it by myself. I made it with a black tea packet. 

I drank the tea at around 6:00 p.m. The only thing I had eaten previously was one piece of bread with nutella on it at like 11:00, and a very small sandwich at around 3:00. So my stomach was pretty much empty, but my metabolism was ready to break anything down. So back to 6:00 p.m

I drink the black tea shrooms and it's great. Doesn't taste like shrooms at all. Tastes like good ole nice black tea. I also swallowed some of the grounded up parts of the shrooms that made it through the strainer. 

At 6:10 I feel an effect that I would get from weed. Slightly happier, tingling body, and relaxed. 

Then, things started to turn south.

I went into my room and sat down at the computer to listen to music. I started listening to Somebody To Love by Queen. It sounded AMAZING so already I could tell things were changing. Though, I didn't finish the song. I paused it near the end because I felt an uneasiness in my stomach. It wasn't really nausea... but it felt like someone was tickling my stomach from the inside. It really made me feel uneasy and a little freaked.

At this point, nausea started to kick in. I felt a little panicked. I got anxiety. So I stood up, and I felt REALLY weak for some reason. I went and layed down in my bet, turned on the TV and watch some Netflix. I watched a Bill Burr Stand Up comedy. Here's where things REALLY went south.

6:15 - I'm really worried about how I feel. I get a lot of anxiety for no reason. Actually, it is for a reason that I was overthinking everything. I started thinking a million times a second. And my heart started pumping REALLY fast... er atleast it felt like that. I really thought I was going to puke so I held a plastic bag near me. I didn't end up puking.

6:18 - I thought that this agony would never end. I just thought, ""Welp, this is going to suck for the next 3-4 hours. What a huge mistake"". So at this point I sort of let fear take over and stopped resisting. I went with the flow. After I started doing that, Things started getting better.

6:20 - I had started shaking and taking really big breaths because of all the anxiety. It was at this point that I would look at the stand up comedian and at one point when he opened his mouth.. it looked like it stretched out REALLY big than ripped open. Fucking terrifying! Then I looked up at this poster of apple's history in my room and the colors started morphing at I got frighted at first, but then I felt WAY better.

6:22 - Suddenly, the sun starts to peak through my door and I realize that light is much more.. warm if that makes sense. I immediately felt a HUGE wave of euphoria and started laughing. It felt like someone defibrillated me color and happiness and life and everything wonderful. I felt so happy! Then I started sobbing and crying and got really emotional. I wasn't sad, but just extremely happy. I had love for everything in this world. I felt at peace with everything. All my fears seemed to be swept away. I used to be afraid of spiders but after taking shrooms I'm not anymore!

6:30 - I'm soaking in happiness. Wonderful euphoria and peace. I feel confident about my self and my surroundings. I get up and walk, I feel REALLY light. I walked and found my cat curled up in a ball. I lay down next to her and looked into her face and saw human characteristics and it was crazy. This sounds really stupid and cheesy, but I felt a whole new level of connection with this animal!
I pet it and its fur was so soft and sweet. I then got up and went to the bathroom to take a piss. HOLY mother of god! This piss was AMAZING. Next I sat on a couch in my living room that overviews the lake and the other side of the city. Then I looked at the sky and clouds and started sobbing again at all the beauty and happiness and how great life is. I thought about many important things in my life that had been bugging me. I came to peace with most of them. At this point, visuals weren't like warped... but everything just looked so amazing. The sky was lit up with different colors and it looked like I was in a round fish tank looking up at the sky. I felt like I was absorbing into the earth and the sky. My friend had started texting me at this time. What I didn't know was that he was on his way over.

6:50 - friend arrives. I'm surprised. Also now my trip changes. I'm so much more talkative! I let him vape a trench of kief in my MFLB to make sure he has a good time also. This was great, we just went walking around the house talking about so much random shit for hours.

8:30-9:00 - Visuals really start to kick in. I have many persian rugs in my house and if you own a persian rug you would know that these things are so cool while tripping! All the patterns were swirling around and meeting each other and blending. It was also at this time that the sunset started happening and I stared at the clouds for like 10-20 minutes. 

9:20 - I take 2 hits from the kief trench in the MFLB. Visuals REALLY start coming. My friend and I are both good piano players (If I do say so myself) so we just both sat at the piano and started playing and composing. We had the lights turned off and this part was AWESOME. Not only because of the music, but because of what I saw. Each time I hit a key on the piano, an electrical thunder of colorful light would shoot from my finger to surround the key that I played. It was so cool! It was like a lightshow. Then my friend took it solo and I stared into a strobe light with my eyes closed. I saw myan temples with rainbows of color shooting past me while a figure was presenting a cube of gold. A lot of other crazy shit I saw when my eyes were closed, but I can't remember all of it right now.

The night basically carried on like that. Playing music, talking, just having a good time. I eventually ordered pizza, but it tasted like shrooms for some reason haha. I ate a lot of ice cream though. I came down to what I think reality is like, at around 11:00-11:30 p.m So all together it lasted around 5 hours. It was nice! Though those 5 hours seemed to last a reaalll long time. Right now, I still feel some what different. But I know that I'm sober, I just feel... a little different. I think after I sleep and wake up tomorrow it will fully be over. Though I would overall rate this as an awesome experience!!

I think that I will eventually do shrooms again, but this trip gave me so much to think about.. I think I won't try shrooms for maybe another couple of months or even a year. This is truly strong stuff, but overall after all of it.. I'm feeling more confident and happy for some reason.

It's not our first time tripping, and we're all pretty creative people. I personally love writing the most, but it's not an easy activity to do with friends. I was hoping you guys knew some games we could play together that have to do with creativity.

 I've already had the idea of drawing something, folding the paper over the drawing leaving only the border of the drawing and letting my friends continue, without seeing what the people before them drew... 
We all love music too and play instruments, sadly we are in a flat for this trip and instruments might be too noisy for the neighbours. Maybe we're gonna try listening to paul kalkbrenner, then go in the flat to find objects with fun noises or try and combine objects to make unique noises. 
We might try making our own music by singing, playing acoustic guitar and making percussions with stuff around us.

I don't know, I'm not sure it's going to be easy to put in place but if you guys could give us a hand, it might be fun. If it doesn't turn out fun there's always the old ""watching the sunset near the canal"" but we'd like to see where psychedelic substances can take our creativity."	t5_2qszq	True

Last saturday, me and three friends picked up a half ounce of shrooms. i paid for half of it ($60) and we weighed everything out and i ended up eating the whole quad over the course of a few hours. 
We relaxed at my friends house and took a nice walk through the woods and everything was fantastic, besides the cold, so we ended up going back inside after 10 or 15 minutes. We chilled in my friends room for the next few hours eating ramen (which i added my final shrooms to). 
i laid back on my friends bed listening to music with everyone and i felt like a million bucks. 
we ended up venturing to a party our friend was having, which felt like the voyage of a lifetime, and when we got there we began mingling and hanging out and after a half hour or so i went out on the balcony to have a cigarette with a friend. 
We had a nice normal conversation but after half my cigarette, my visuals began to get stronger and stronger, and mid-sentence, my mind felt like it was vacuumed from my body and i was weightless. i saw every memory i had, every regret i had was on my left side and every good memory on my right. i felt, for the first time in my life, pure bliss. 
It seemed to me like i was wandering around in this realm of thoughts and memories for months, trying to sort out everything, feeling pride and shame all in one. after this internal journey started to fade, the spiraling visuals came back and my vision came back to see myself being carried by two of my friends who i dropped with. they put me in a bed back in the house and i asked, ""how long was i gone?"" they responded, ""maybe 30 seconds man."" 
my mind was blown. i couldn't believe that all of that had passed in my mind over 30
seconds. i remained in my trance for a few hours. in a strange state of consciousness i felt like i never had before. i laid back and listened to music and enjoyed my good vibes for about 3 hours before passing into a deep sleep. 
tl;dr i took a lot of shrooms and went into a strange trance. it was great. "	t5_2qszq	True

1367133627.0	1d9gca	First time report - strange but good.	KCP100	17	3	5	"So Friday night I decided to try shrooms for the first time. This is actually the first time I have ever done any drug, ever. I've never even drank or smoked; completely straight edge to this point, and this was quite a way to start. 

I ground up my P. Cubes and put them into capsules. I ended up taking a little over an 1/8th with a glass of orange juice on an empty stomach. They went down so quick and smooth with no taste or anything. I never had any nausea or stomach problems either. It did seem to take longer than expected for them to kick in though, a little over an hour. I was at home and there were other people that couldn't be woken, so my activities were limited and I'm sure most of you would find this an incredibly boring trip, but it was just plain incredible to me. I was in bed for most of it, listening to music and staring at my ceiling. I never really got many trippy visuals, which was disappointing. If I looked close enough at textured surfaces they would move a little but no colors changed or anything else incredible. The one visual thing that really amazed me was that I looked over at my lamp just a few feet away, and one of the chains to turn the lights on was swinging back and forth, but the other wasn't. There was nothing that would cause this to happen. I even reached over and stopped it from swinging but as soon as I looked away it was swinging again. Blew my fucking mind. 

After a while I got up and roamed the house in the dark. Everything seemed much bigger. The rooms, the distance the walls and furniture were from me. I would reach my arm out and try to touch the wall or something to guide me in the dark and it was always much further away than I thought it should be. I would love to see what I was actually doing. I grabbed my cat and took him back to be with me. He felt so much softer and squishier than normal, it was amazing. Normally when I take him to bed he won't stay with me, but he did for awhile this time. I don't know if he could tell I was tripping or what but he was purring and rubbing on my nonstop. He was acting a bit strange but that might have just been my perception. I don't really know how long this lasted because I had no perception of time. At some point later he did leave though. 

I then starting playing Dolphin Olympics 2 while listening to some music. This was amazing because I was doing surprisingly well at the game. The dolphin seemed to react to the music and was going so much faster than normal. At one point I hit the bottom of the ocean and hurt my dolphin which made me really sad. (If you have not played this game, it's just a stupid flash game but it can be incredibly fun when you go hard at it.)

At this point it was like 3:30 in the morning and I had taken them at 11:30. All I really wanted to do was go to sleep but that couldn't happen yet and I knew it. I ended up just laying in bed for a few more hours thinking about life. It was really nice in a sense but I also could not get comfortable. I was cold and tired and couldn't sleep, so that was not good. This part of the trip was not really enjoyable. I couldn't sleep and was beginning to feel like I might never be normal again. I don't know what time I did fall asleep but when I woke up in the morning feeling normal it was one of the most euphoric experiences. I felt fantastic and all of today I felt really happy and energized despite the extreme lack of sleep. 

All in all, I am very glad I got to experience this and will definitely do it again in a better setting with people I trust. "	t5_2qszq	True

Have any of you had an unexpected epiphany even when nothing in life had been needing a change? If I don't have any self-realization, will I just have a good time thinking philosophically, talking nonsense, and hallucinating? I totally understand setting etc. means **alot** when doing shrooms as well. 
Sorry if this question had been asked before on this subreddit, I would just like to talk to you guys personally about this. I am so excited to try them for my first time and will definitely post back in a week or so telling of my experience!

If you've seen that video on tosh.o where that guy is freaking out on shrooms, thats pretty much what i went through last night.

My brain literally became handicapped , I was LITERALLY retarded.

In the first hour I was having a sweet time, walking around the river and campgrounds, having insane visuals and shit and then when i got back to the campsite it just went down hill. I threw up and started dry heaving like crazy, then I didn't even have the need to breathe and I remembered that I needed to. I feel like I could've been seriously in danger at that moment. What I went through was something so dreadful, that when I snapped out of it two hours later I was so happy and grateful about life. 

I became a vegetable, I couldn't talk or think clearly at all, it was like i had the brain of an animal. I couldn't even make sense of the clothes on my body.

Then i thought it was going to last forever.

I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital and become a vegetable for the rest of my life. My friends didn't understand what was going on and I just had this anger and complete confusion. I wasn't having any visuals at this point, just my brain was completely shut down. I didn't even know what the term scary or bad trip meant because of how handicapped my brain had become. I could only make sense of a few words at a time and I could not communicate and make sense AT ALL.

After a coupe hours At 3 o clock, I came back at an instant, and I was so grateful and happy to be back to normal again.

So anyway, I just thought I'd share this story with you guys. Never posted in here before, and I'd like to talk about it with you guys :D"	t5_2qszq	True

I picked up some shrooms friday so I could try them for the first time ever, I was very excited and pretty nervous about trying them but I had been in a good mood all day so I had a feeling it would be a great trip. Around midnight I ate 2.5 grams and the played GTA IV for about 25 minutes while waiting for them to kick in. I felt a body high and felt pretty good but I didn't have the full effects yet. So me and my friend decided to go outside (he didn’t do shrooms with me, he just hung out and watched me). We walked for about 5 minutes and I was starting to feel the full effects coming on to me and man was it great. At one point I threw up but just barely. We went to an area that had a drainage thing and some trees and a shed and hung out there for a while. It had just rained earlier so I was walking around barefoot in the water and it felt great. I kept looking at the ground and the side of the shed and watched them breathe and kind of morph around, it was unlike anything I have ever experienced. Colors didn’t seem a whole lot brighter than usual but some stood out more than others, I had some pretty awesome closed eye visuals of all these various colors and shapes moving around. At one point I kept seeing little mushroom shapes that were all different colors (these were still closed eye visuals). I was kind of hoping to have open eye hallucinations but I didn't. After my peak, me and my friend headed home and he pretty much fell asleep right after we got inside. I lied down and tried to get some sleep but for some reason I couldn't so sat there and just closed my eyes and watched the visuals. My mind was racing; so many thoughts were going through my head. I got on my phone to browse reddit but it seemed as if the letters were wobbling around but they were still readable. After that my cat came and hung out with me for a while and before long it was already 4 am, the high had pretty much worn off all the way so I decided to get some sleep. I woke up feeling great today and it’s been an awesome day. I can’t wait to try them again soon. I do have a few more questions though, does shrooms make you guys talk a lot because I couldn't seem to stop talking. Has anyone ever gone swimming on shrooms?

Ive been dying to shroom since November 2012 but never had a hook up. Now I have one and am getting an 1/8 but don't know the strain (will post pic for recognition when I get them soon). 

Dose- I planned to do a lemon tekked half 1/8 and in a smoothie then wait an hour or two. Feel if I want more, then just normal lemon tek however much I feel.

Set/setting- my friends parents are leaving so he has an open house for a few days. He said he'd keep it empty for a while so I can shroom there. He lives by the woods so we can go there to go for nature.
I also want to explore who I am. So i have access to a private room and he said I could chill there. I will have headphones with electronic, trap, tons of kid cudi, great 80's and alternative rock. And when people say they learn about themselves, what mindset are you in? Do you just like zone out in your thoughts? 

Also if I need to shorten my comedown for any reason, will .25mg of xanax bring me down?

I will also have access to a mirror because I really want to see that

1346462490.0	z5z9t	My first trip	soomba2	16	4	4	"I'm 18, and the only other drug I had done before shrooms was weed, so I was pretty nervous about doing shrooms. I even had bad trips on weed, and I knew weed was pussy shit compared to shrooms and whatever else is out there. So yea, I was kinda terrified of the idea of doing shrooms, but my two friends had both done it, and told me it was a great time and had nothing to worry about. I had been getting better with controlling my highs anyway, so I figured I would grow a pair and give it a shot. My friends suggested that once we ate the shrooms, we smoke weed right before it hits us, because it makes the trip so much better. Nervous about this also, I didn't want to risk it, but they convinced me. 

We went out to long island to do this, where my friend has a summer house. There's this baseball field we wanted to go to, which is right next to a mini beach, where nobody ever goes, so it was a perfect plan. We left his house, distributed the shrooms evenly onto the underside of a frisbee, and we ate the shrooms right in the middle of the street. We each had about 2.3 grams, and walked to the baseball field. We were gonna make the bong, using a gatorade bottle and a trumpet mouthpiece. We got to the baseball field about 10 minutes later, and figured we had another 40-50 minutes before we should start making the bong and smoking. So we set up camp in the middle of the baseball field, took off our shirts, and played frisbee for a bit. It was hot as balls that day. After about 15 more minutes, we all gathered together, and I said “is it me or the shrooms are kicking in a bit?” Nothing crazy was happening, but everything seemed a bit off, and I felt hotter than I should've. My friends agreed, then one of them goes “yea, just stare into the grass over there...it looks funny.” It looked like it was all shifting around and doing weird things. We looked at the grass for about 30 more seconds...then we realized we still needed to set up the bong. We all panicked and grabbed the supplies as quickly as possible. My friend started working on the bong, but we immediately started tripping face before we could do it. We started dying laughing and my friend couldn't gather the energy to set up this bong. We started laughing like we never have. I sounded like a little girl screaming, I don't know where it came from. I'm pretty embarrassed. So we all just sat there, laying in the grass, listening to music from an iHome. Music was the most beautiful thing ever at the time. Well, everything was, but especially music. The song “Lucky” by Jason Mraz and Colbie Collet came on, which I had never heard before, and I wanted to cry. I couldn't believe how beautiful it was. I listen to it occasionally now, and its pretty good, but at the time it was amazing. We spent about 2 hours in the field just sitting there, laughing like hell about the dumbest shit, attempting to play frisbee once in a while, and just looking at how crazy everything looked. At one point my friend said “wow, we really failed at setting up that bong before.” The three of us then looked at each other wide-eyed and started hysterically laughing, because we all realized we hadn't even smoked yet, yet we were still going insane. This actually happened a few more times later on. 

I laid on my back in the grass, and after staying still for about a minute I started to lose feeling in my limbs. It felt as if I was becoming the grass, and my friends said it looked like I was becoming the grass too, like it was swallowing my body. I thought it was the craziest thing. We looked at the 1 or two clouds that were in the sky, and talked about what they looked like. I played with the grass throughout the whole 2 hours. I tore out so much from the dirt. I even ate some. Yea, me and one of my friends were constantly putting random things in our mouths, just because. Pretty weird. At one point, I bit my thumb and thought “wow, I could probably bite my thumb off if I tried,” and considered it. I barely felt pain, and I didn't think at the time it would matter. But then I realized I was tripping balls and probably shouldnt. We had a few cans of Arnold Palmer, and taking the slightest sip of it was so interesting. I couldn't swallow it, but the taste was amazing me. My friend at one point took out a ukelele and tried to play, but it was out of tune, and he couldn't tune it. Instead, we continued listening to the music. Everything was so great, I felt amazing and had no worries in the world. Such a happy,crazy time. The one thing that concerned me though, was that if someone showed up and spoke to us, I wouldve had no idea what to do. I'd never been drunk/high to the point where I can't control myself in front of strangers, but during my trip, I would've made such a fool of myself. Luckily, nobody interacted with us. 3 hours into the trip, a bunch of little league players started showing up with their parents and started setting up for a practice . They looked at us like we were crazy, and we realized we needed to bounce. We tried to focus as much as we possibly could, and got all of our shit into our bags. We actually did a surprisingly good job with that, I was impressed. 

We walked off the baseball field casually (or at least I thought it was casually at the time), and moved on to the beach. The sand felt so incredible on my feet. I didnt want to leave. We walked on the beach for a bit, then decided we should step our feet in the water, just to see what it was like. At this point, I had kiiind of started to come down, just enough to not do anything stupid. Still, I was worried one of us would wind up drowning ourselves, so I insisted we stay only knee deep in the water. The water also felt incredible. It was actually freezing, and I would've hated it if I wasn't shrooming, but I loved it. The feeling of the cold wasn't unpleasant, it was just a feeling. A feeling that I was able to notice, but didn't care that I felt it. We all stood in the water, and at this point the trip had shifted from crazy/ridiculous to meaningful/enlightening. We started thoroughly talking about the beauty of everything, and a bunch of random stuff. After a bit we did wind up going completely under water, but only for about half a second to see what it was like. We then moved back to the sand and lied down in it. We continued our serious bro chat. There was this bug in the sand and we thought about how that sand was the bug's world. While we have streets and neighborhoods that we become familiar with over time, the bug has this sand pit that's always changing. He doesn't know how to get around. I shifted the sand that he was about to step on and I say “see, look, it's like Im the god of his world. I just changed his entire world.” He then tried climbing up this mini hill of sand, so I helped him out a bit. It sounds silly now, but at the time it was extremely deep and serious to my friends and I. After about another half hour of sitting and talking, we had come down enough to walk home. We gathered our stuff and went back to his house. I was in shock at how crazy my day was. It was like I went to another world, and I really wanna go back.

1376385965.0	1k9olq	3G's, 4 hits of a blunt, Bad trip, Faced my self.	icyomer	14	3	12	"This was my second time taking shrooms. The first time, at 2.25 G's i didnt feel much so i upped the dosage. 2 years ago me and my best friend (we'll call him Z) were completely straight edge. I however started stressing out because of school and in a jokingly manner my friend said if i kept it up id be a pot head by the end of the year. I told him i was considering trying it out, just to see what its like, and he told me he would try it if i tried shrooms. 1 year later me and him smoked for the first time together. A year after that we finally found a source for shrooms(i'll post that trip later if you guys are interested). 

Anyway now we move on to todays trip. My friend ""N"" wanted to chill with us while we we're on shrooms so we obliged. Knowing it took a while to kick in we ate them and then drove about twenty minutes towards him. I had also brought a gallon container of Orange juice because i heard it enhances trips(important to story later). We went into a groccery store near  his neighborhood to avoid the summer heat. While inside I took a piss inside the urinal. After a bit Z looks into the urinal and says ""HOLY SHIT DID YOU JUST PISS ALL THAT"" try as i might he couldnt comprehend that there was water in it before i pissed. The shrooms had begun its effects on him. It took a while longer on me because i am a pretty large guy(170lb, 5'9(also important)). I tell him too look in the mirror, and i do as well, kind of trippy staring into your own eyes, although later i stared at my soul. Anyway we see N and walk towards him, then the giggles land on our face. He asks us how if we're tripping yet and Z says yeah, i say just a case of the giggles.

some other events occur, but lets fast forward towards where i start tripping hardcore. We light up a miracle blunt. It was terribly rolled but it worked so no complaints. then started walking in this nature trail close to my neighborhood. Unfortunately apparently other people are here as well (CUE PARANOIA). I start getting nervous that everyone can tell. Then I start thinking about how i broke a promise to myself about only smoking in safe places. I keep trying to ignore this and move along but At this point im worried im going to fuck up my life. (If i get a police record i cant become a teacher). 

Eventually we leave and head out to the car. HERE IS WHERE I GO BAT SHIT CRAZY. I start looping. I start realizing things about myself i wish i had never known. For instances, Occasionally i'll wear dress shirts just for the sake of it because i try to dress nice to compensate for me being fat. But in my head i just seem like a cartoon, out of place and ridiculously dressed. Then i start thinking about every single thing ive said and realize how lame i seem all the time. I think about how desperate i seem to have friends, and how i must be messing up N's day since this is the first time in a while we chilled. Then I get terrified that police are coming. So i ask N if he can drive somewhere else. N begins driving. Terribly. I ask him if he's okay to drive and he says yeah. He wasnt. So (i think) we pulled up somewhere. Meanwhile I am bombarded by dry mouth from smoking. Fuck me. 

I say nothing about the dry mouth. I recently started visiting /r/fatpeoplestories and there was a story about how a fat person ruined a bunch of peoples day by continuing to ask for food. I didnt want to be that guy. It was then that i realized i dont browse that subreddit to laugh (although its kinda hilarious) i browse it because i dont want to be the annoying fat guy. So i sit and suffer dry mouth in silence for a bit. Then I make the mistake of trying to lick my the inside of my mouth. It was desert storm in there. It hurt to touch something so dry to another dry part (mad respect to anal porn actors out there). Then it started to effect my breathing. It didnt help that i had a sort throat. I kept asking Z and N if my breathing was normal, to which they replied i was (still dont know if this was true), i now had them worried and hated myself for bring them down a bit.

Z told me to listen to some music to help the bad trip go away (it helped me last time) but on 3G's the trip was to powerful. N was playing some music on his stereo so i felt like i was insulting him by listening to my head phones. We begin to drive back to my car and i cant help but feel somewhat thankful.

MASS EGODEATH: I start to think about who i am but lose sight of who i am in my mind. Instead i stare at my goals and my actions. I feel like nothing, an empty shell, I never really thought about what ive done. When looking at myself i realize in terms of actions, I work, do drugs and play video games with my friends, and thats all that i am. Thats it. Im not some sort of leader, or anyone with accomplishments. I am drugs,games, and work. Thats it. I felt so empty. I thought of my hobbies to console myself. Drawing and writing are something right? I havent written or drawn in months. What about my goals? I want to be a teacher, but should some one like me  teach and lead youth? No, im not worthy I thought. Drugs/games/work,I shouldn't be in charge of anything. 

I started looping. Im so thirsty. If i ask for something to drink it'll nag everyone and make people feel down. I should say something positive to join in the conversation. I cant breathe or talk right. My mouth is too dry. Im so thirsty. etc. Eventually more problems joined in. I thought to myself ""help me"". But there was no me. Just drugs/games/work. Why was HE(me) working? to move out so he can do drugs freely? So he can play games with his friends? Good job drugs/games/work. I thought about my age, i was almost twenty. thats a quarter of my life. Maybe i should just die right here. A thought occured. I was better than i was 5 minutes ago. It wasnt much, but it meant id survive. I looked up and saw that we had only been driving for two minutes. Fuck.

My friend N asks me why Z and I werent hanging with P and B (two other friends) we explained they though we all use to be cool, once they started selling pot they started getting stupider, riskier, and douchier. They always wanted to party and we just wanted to chill. Then it hit me. I shouldnt deserve to judge them. All I am is Drugs/games/work, who am I to judge(I met up with them later than night out of guilt to rekindle our friendship, meh not my greatest move but i really feel responsible for who theyve become.)

The looping is getting worse, I start thinking about my recent dieting and realize that holy fuck i may have an eating disorder Ive been averaging in about 1000 calories a day. I make sure not to say this outloud. A fat guy talking about how he is isnt eating enough is just not something anyone would take seriously. ten pounds in two weeks without excercise is pretty bad though.(eating healthier now) I then think about how white i try to look despite being black, even the way I comb my hair. I look like a goddamn cartoon. I think about school and how im doing terrible. And I think about how in my diet im only suppose to drink water. Goddamn im thirsty. I wish I had that orange juice.

We finally get to my car and i drink some orange juice (Oh thank fuck). But now im remembering how on/r/fatpeoplestories there was a girl who carried a two liter of Dr. Pepper, and how it was utterly disgusting. I moderated my use of the OJ. I start feeling better and Z tells me he was worried. Apparently I looked like i was in hell. I apologize profusely and they tell me that they're just happy im feeling better. N leaves and now its just me and Z in the car. I tell him how i felt about our feud with P and B, he doesnt necessarily agree but doesnt combat it. We go visit P and B. Instant regret. I kind of remember why we stopped hanging out, but im still going to work on our friendship in the future.

Its been about three days since then. I still havent fully recovered from the egodeath. I know Im more than my actions but now, i cant help but question it. Im still feeling a bit of leftover sadness. And i still kind of feel a meaningless void. I probably wont do shrooms or weed again until I accomplish something and have a safe place.

Honestly I dont know if I'll be okay.

Any advice?	lostmyshrooms	13	3	14	"So I was at a music festival a few weeks ago, and I had taken an eighth oz. of shrooms with a bunch of my friends. It was the first time I had ever taken shrooms before, but I had done acid before so I thought I could handle it. I didn't anticipate what was going to happen.

The come up felt fantastic, and I was pumped for the trip, but as I was watching the band, Paper Diamonds, my trip started taking a dark turn.

My thoughts became very dark and disturbing, and I looked around and felt that I was ultimately isolated from everyone. One thought led to another, and I couldn't get out or break out of this horrible cycle of bad thoughts. And I felt that no one truly cared for me, and my existence on this earth was utterly pointless. I didn't want to talk to anyone or be anywhere, not even with myself, for the rest of the night.

They say that a good trip is where everything is happy and you feel completely connected with everyone and everything. But with this trip, I felt like a universal truth was revealed to me about my place in the universe... and ultimately how I didn't belong. I have told no one about this, not even my friends that I tripped with that night.

Ever since this night I have been stuck in a funk of depression; like I will never be happy again or the same again. I haven't been able to talk to anyone else about this because I felt like no one could relate.

Any idea about what I experienced or can anyone relate?

EDIT: I also have noticed I have had increased paranoia about the thoughts of others since then. I have become more suspicious of the motives of my loved ones in my life, which is tearing me up inside and I'm worried it's going to hurt my relationships with them.

EDIT 2: I appreciate all the support from everyone! You guys are truly awesome for giving such genuine advice to me, a complete stranger. I'll be alright, I just have to learn from the experience more than everything. Thank you to you all.

1368168472.0	1e214l	Want to shroom again, but concerned about past results, and current mental health issues.	The8thFrontier	16	7	31	"Hi there shroomers. Using a throwaway account (that I now will be using for things I just can't post on my main account).

So here's the deal. I have shroomed 2 times in my life. Once when I was 18, and once when I was 22. For reference, I turn 24 next weekend. I have smoked pot many times before, but (more or less) I am limited to those two drugs. The first time I shroomed was on a whim freshmen year of college. Sort of anyway. I had been curious about them since high school, but never had the guts to try them. Long story short, I did them (1.6g species unknown), and had one hell of a time. I did it on my door floor, told pretty much everyone I knew what I was doing while I was on them. I was able to find people to be around, and also isolate just as I wanted. So much body high and overall silliness. It overall was a great experience, and one I will remember. The aftermath was not too bad. At the time I wasn't in the best of headspace, but I was alright.

I couldn't find them again (I was not looking hard) until I was 22. I had wanted to do them again since I first did them, so when I found them I jumped on it even though it was not under ideal circumstances. Didn't care, I just really wanted to do them. The details (set/setting)? Meh, they'd work themselves out. Bad idea. Long story short for this, I did them (3.1g unknown species), controlled my behavior WAY too much cause I am too good at doing that. ALL emotion left me (goodbye happiness, so long fear), and I became 100% suicidal with no fear of death. Nothing mattered at all. My thoughts were pretty much ""Death? Meh. Let's give that a shot."" The only thing that kept me alive, is I was able to remember my sober self that said ""no, dying is bad, don't do that"". I knew to listen to that. I crashed mildly once I came down. I cried in my moms arms professing how profoundly lonely I was, and how I couldn't connect with anyone and feel, and haven't been able to for years. Eventually, coming to the conclusion that I was not meant to do shrooms, that it was just wrong for me. Despite the fact that I very much want to explore hallucinogens. I didn't like that conclusion, and I don't want to listen to it.

That was almost 2 years ago now, and I want to do them again. I just... I hesitate. I have been back and forth suicidal (seeing a therapist, don't worry) for several months, and have been depressed for a few years now. I am fearful that if I do them, it might make things WORSE, or dangerous. This time I'd make sure to do it in an environment where I would feel free. The only problem is there is a variable I'd want that I can't control.

I am lonely. Really, really lonely. To the point where it physically hurts at times. In a romantic sense mostly (I'm gay btw), but in other ways as well. I so badly want a boyfriend it hurts. Why? Cause I've never had one, and I still can't find one, and trust me I am trying. I am the kind of guy who loves sharing experiences. It's very important to me. I fear that if I do shrooms, I might be like ""this is great! but... I am alone"", and cue the downward spiral. As much as I love and need my alone time, and I very well could enjoy a solo trip SO much, I fear I'll get absolutely bombarded with loneliness, and be unable to outlet that.

Ultimately, I just want to have a fun experience! I need some fun in my life. Long ago in what feels like another lifetime now, a friend one said ""shrooms are like going on vacation without going anywhere"". Me? I NEED a vacation. Ultimately I just want something fun, or profound, or fulfilling. Something positive. Not too much to ask, right?

Given the above circumstances, would it be a good, or bad idea to trip again? I will admit, I want the answer to be yes, I want validation. Ultimately, what I need though is the truth.

I can also answer any questions you might have."	t5_2qszq	True

I have been listening to the Joe Rogan Experience podcast for a bit and listening to the podcasts he has had with Terrence McKenna and doing research on my own and it seems like something that would help me.  Basically, I have had anxiety almost all my life and for about the last 3-4 years I have been severely depressed.  Currently I am out of the depression but the anxiety is not gone.  I have taken like 5-6 different medications for them both like effexor, welbutrin, etc. but I decided one day that I would stop taking them and have not had any periods of prolonged depression since.  I have always been introspective which is one of the reasons why I want to trip alone, as I feel like it would be more conductive to introspection and trying to confront my anxiety.  I live in a rural area and have 10 acres and am surrounded by farmland so I plan on just walking around my property and around my house during the trip.  So yeah sorry for rambling about myself for a bit but I think it would help with any advice you guys would like to give me if you could be so kind.  Thanks.	t5_2qszq	True
1366216373.0	1cjht0	First experience. One that I will treasure for the rest of my life	bassri	11	2	5	"Hey guys. I would like to share with you my very first experience with shrooms. I always wanted to do shrooms to experience its spiritual and life changing power. I've always been interested in self improvement and growth. It happened last saturday when two of my friends showed up with a bag of shrooms in my apartment in the afternoon. I just woke up and wasn't ready for it at the time. I was slightly nervous because I didn't know what to expect although I researched a lot before doing it. Not only that, but I also wasn't very comfortable around one the guys I was tripping with. Anyways, since it was my first time, I decided to only take 1.6 g. Other friends took about 2g each. I ate the shrooms and just chilled with my friends waiting for the effects to kick in. After about half an hour, I started to feel the body buzz or high or whatever you may call it. I was nervous at the time, but all of sudden, all my nervousness was gone and I started to feel very euphoric. The visual effects were mild, I started noticing the very fine details around me, like the patterns in my shirt, the small dust particles in the air, the very little details in friends' faces like the hair in their eyebrows. I was really enjoying it ! Then a friend of mine wanted to smoke a cigarette so we all went outside with him, and that's when my real experience began. It was one of the most beautiful Saturday afternoons ever. A very beautiful and extremely blue sky with some nice small clouds. the trees and the grass were just about to get green after a very cold winter. I never felt so humble and so small before that. It was one of the most peaceful moments of my life. Then I got lost thinking of my shoes, and how they've gotten very old. Normally, I would just think I need another shoes, but this time, I really loved them because they lived me for almost a year. I didn't think of them as shoes, but rather as old and very loyal friends. My friends decided to go back inside and I decided to go take a walk and enjoy the scenery. When I was walking while observing the beautiful nature around me, I felt a sense of Unity with the whole universe. A sense of unity with every flower I see. I ran into one of my friends while walking who is sometimes a little awkward around people. I had a nice small conversation with him then kept going. I thought to myself how I loved that guy and how I accepted him just the way he was. I went back home and had some deep philosophical conversation with my friends about how we all should accept and love each other. Then I talked with the friend who i didn't feel very comfortable around, but this time we really opened up to each other, and now we became very good friends. 

This trip was very mild in terms of visual effects, but was extremely deep in terms of thoughts. Because of this trip, I was able to understand the concept of self and ego, and realized that I'm a man with a big ego. I got connected to my true self, and opened a wide gate for me to grow and focus on my true self instead of wasting my energy on the ego

Definitely one of the best experiences I've ever had in my life.  "	t5_2qszq	True

He still has the dozen or so cakes left over and the bruised while being cultivated, so the mycelium contains magic. If he ground up the cakes in a blender and soaked them in 198 proof alcohol, filtered the solids and condensed the solution, will it contain a potent amount of magic? He has heard about this method of extraction using dried and powdered shrooms, but not the cakes. Anyone heard of this, done this?
I will have him document thoroughly if this works.

Update:: the monkey did the extraction with alcohol, filtered and reduced the volume. The result is 750ml of amber ""blue juice"" with about 2 inches of white fluffy crystals in the bottom of the bottle. They have yet to have a live test subject sample the results. That will be another update. But it appears the white crystals are pure and fell out of solution during the reduction and cooling phase after multiple filters. Unsure the yield at the time.

1349191061.0	10tidc	My boyfriend and I were thinking of trying shrooms and making a day of it, but I'm worried! Need advice for a first-timer, please!	socksintheair	11	1	22	"I'm worried because I am a pretty anxious person. I never let my anxiety stop me from doing anything, and am down for anything. However, I do have occasional panic attacks (I know, who doesn't) and I often have paranoid, annoying thoughts-- such as, I'm a bit of a mental hypochondriac. I always worry I have all of these different disorders, which puts some bizarre scenarios and thoughts in my head, although all I have is anxiety!!

To the point, I would really like to try something new, have a fun, adventurous experience and do shrooms with my amazing boyfriend. I'm just a bit worried that I'll freak out, all of the mental disorders I fear will come true, and I'll be a psycho, never the same (obviously, this may be more anxiety haha). Smoking weed also makes me feel crazy anxious, so I typically don't.

Excited and nervous.	zodam	11	0	7	"Okay so me and 3 other buddies picked up some shrooms and we've dedicated all day tomorrow to take them. I'm sorry if these are repeat questions, I'm sure people come on here and ask these questions all the time, but hey, /r/shrooms seems like a supportive community!

Anyways we are going to be eating 2g each. Its everybody's first time except one of us who did it once before and had a bad trip :/. Is 2g enough? too much? too little?

I've heard absolute horror stories of bad trips. I know its difficult to explain but how exactly does a trip go bad? and once it goes bad is it reversable? At first I didn't really worry about this because overall I'm a happy person, I'm happy with my life, content with everything, and I don't really have any anxiety, stress, or  depression problems at all. But the more and more I hear about bad trips, and how you wanna avoid them at all costs makes me slightly nervous. Last thing I wanna do is be stuck in a nightmare for 5+ hours.

How long does it last? If theres anything that MAY make me anxious/stressed/nervous if I feel stuck in the trip. Also If I start thinking about homework. I have a few big exams coming up next week but still decided to dedicate all day tomorrow to this. Depending on when I come down I may even be able to study at night.

Last question. What are some fun things to do? Were all university students in Philadelphia We were just gonna hang out at the apartment for half the trip, play video games, relax, watch movies etc. We were also thinking about walking around campus or going to pick up dinner. Even go to fairmount park. Any suggestions in this matter?

I took slightly more than a gram... put it in the coffee grinder while I set a cup of water to boil. After the water boiled, I let it cool for about 20 seconds, then I dropped the blended shrooms in the hot water. I let them sit there for 10-15 minutes tops. 

After the psilocybin was extracted, I used a coffee filter to pour the water into the cup, filtering out the shroom pieces. For extras, I added a chamomile tea bag and a spoonful of sugar.

I guzzled the tea on an empty stomach and sat at my computer browsing none other than.../r/woahdude  ... after about 15 minutes I began feeling the effects. It felt like I smoked some really strong weed... plus  I felt relaxed from the chamomile. Everything was in slow motion and I felt the waves hitting me... very calmly. I saw colors becoming more vivid immediately... So... I then put on some random ambient music and opened my trusty Winamp's  Milkdrop visualizer (HIGHLY FUCKING RECOMMENDED, you will thank me greatly if you are not familiar with this. http://www.winamp.com/visualization/milkdrop/62202 ) NIN - Ghosts I - IV music is my recommendation for the mood... http://ghosts.nin.com/main/home

Shroom tea is a nice casual trip... this scenario being a level 1 trip... maybe I'll brew some more next time... like 2-3 grams should get me to a level 3.

It lasted about 4 hours, plus I popped a couple more caps that took me through the night... watched Avatar intermittently and closed the night with some Fallout NV /r/fnv  /r/Fallout .

Then i started panicking that i realized why i knew i was put on this planet. 
My eyes swayed left to right repeatedly at blazing speeds to the point where i could not control it. my muscles started getting really tight, pulsing feeling down my left arm, tightness in my right arm, and then my body started to force it self into a fetal position, my arms together, my head started going to the right all the way to my shoulders. I started taking DEEP fucking breaths to the point i could not exhale my breath. 

Now you must understand that i had no control over it.My whole body started vibrating/pulsing and i faced the ceiling. Now I KID YOU NOT, without touching my penis in anyway, my flaccid penis went fully erect in half a second ON ITS OWN and i literally came 7-8 times back to back. IT WAS THE BEST FEELING IN THE WORLD. I mean i dont think ANYONE I MEAN ANYONE has jizzed the way i jizzed. My jizzing was at least 100x better than a regular jizzing.  I still have not exhaled and my eyes start to roll back all the way to the back of my head, and black out. 

I havent done shrooms since that incident because i was really scared that it might happen again. I stuck to weed and started having flashbacks from the shroom incident. I start to panic again, and get the same feelings in my arms, legs,etc. I have had to convince myself to stop panicking for 2 weeks while on weed. What is happening to me?

Although the high isn't terrible, I miss having a regular (less intense) weed high.

I should also mention that I smoked weed right before eating the mushrooms, and some have told me that I should do shrooms again without smoking up first to 'break' this association.

1277937605.0	ckpu0	Accidental semi-heroic dose cubensis	kaminix	11	1	12	"Hi
So yesterday I got a bit careless. A friend of mine had grown cubensis from one of those, as I'd like to call them, [shake n bake boxes](http://www.azarius.net/smartshop/shrooms/grow_boxes/myceliumbox_bplus/) (no affiliation).

Anyway, I was going to buy some shrooms to him with a friend of mine who had never tried shrooms before. Over the day I call him a total of 14 times but he's still asleep. I figure I won't be getting any shrooms and leave my pocket scale at home while going to meet up with my friend when I decide to call him one last time: he picks up!

In my opinion it really was too late to start shrooming at 9:15 PM (or 21:15 as we say in Europe), but I was so determined that I was going to try it with that friend of mine that day that I didn't care.

As I had left my pocket scale at home I was pretty much guessing how much it was. About two weeks ago three of us had tried about 15 g + about 10 g (second dose not weighted but close to same ammount) an hour later of fresh ones; that was a little less then half I thought so splitting the rest between the two of us would land us at 4-5 maybe 6 grams which I considered reasonable considering I barely felt anything the first time.

I later got to know that in those bag were probably somewhere between 12-15 grams dried cubensis each. I felt a bit bad after hearing that since it was my friends first psychadelic trip, having only tried canabis before, but luckily he texted me saying he really enjoyed himself and learned a lot from the trip.

Anyway, we ingest the shrooms on our way home. It starts raining and we half run through the city with the shrooms kicking it just before we reach my apartment. At this time I feel amazing, I got the same feeling I've had on both my LSD trips where it's like my whole body is giggling in a sort of way. Then walking up the rock stairs under cover from the some trees I feel I'm walking up a jungle or something to my apartment, it's amazing really.

Then once we get inside the trip turns to the worse. I figure I should turn on some music but I can't think of any. I first turn on shpongle but it creeps me out and then some kashiwa daisuke but it too creeped me out. At this point I really couldn't figure out how to work my computer to I just paused the music and left it be. I started getting a belly ache from the shrooms and lie down feeling as if I've got a fever. My friend is laughing hysterically looking at his own hands and the whole room is starting to swing around. Thinking about it afterwards this probably would've been an awesome experience had it not been for the belly ache.

I go to the toilet trying to puke, figuring it might make the trip weaker (which I didn't really care much about at the moment) but most of all it'll probably make me feel better either way. I can't, I stick fingers down my throat really trying but I can't. Not even a little.

I start looking around the dirty toilet thinking things like ""well, here I am. I had ambitions once (and still do, just couldn't feel them then) and here I am trying to puke up mushrooms in a dirty toilet"". Finally I give up and admit to myself that things aren't going very well for me.

I go to my room mate (not the one tripping with me, she's very antidrugs) and tell her straight out that I'm feeling very ill and want her to help me. I really can't tell how happy I am to have such a kind room mate, I bought her some ice cream and shit today trying to show my appreciation. Also I tried explaining to her the terror she helped me through but it turned out to be a lot harder than I thought.

So I hold on to her and I'm almost crying. I knew that the mushrooms aren't really dangerous in the sense that they can kill me and I know I'm quite safe from schizofrenia and things like that (judging from my family history), but I still felt pretty much as if I was going to die. In all my higher-dose psychedelic trips I really get the feeling that I can feel (not see though) the prescence of a god, in the case of my good trips it's a kind god wanting to enlighten me on the workings of the world but this god was furious. I figured he thought I'd been disrespectful to the drug, being careless with the dosing. I could feel his prescence much stronger than at any other of my trips and I could feel him wanting to destroy me.

As I held on to my room mate there was like a storm going through my head and the god tried to pull me out of reality in to another, evil, dimension. When I had my eyes closed I could see this storm clearly, then I would open up my eyes and reattach myself to reality. Even with my eyes open I could see very pretty, though frightening at the time, psychedelic patterns in the room. They were coming on and of like some sort of radio jitter.

Even though I was suffering through this trip I can still remember my room mate, knowing nothing at all about shrooms or any other drug, asking if I wanted to go to the hospital or anything and I answered ""no, that'd just ruin it"".

After a while my stomach ache calmed down and the trip took a more pleasant turn. I couldn't quite enjoy it as much because of what happened before this, I was still very shook up and wanted it to end.

----------

Well, it ended and I was very happy when it did. Still, I thought it was a very giving trip. I will definitely use shrooms again, though I'll be much more careful in the future. I also think, having felt as if I've been on the brink of insanity, I might learn to appreciate life and soberness more for what it is. I will still use drugs, psychedelics in particular because they teach me these things, but maybe a bit more carefully.

What do you think? Anyone ever done something similar?

Back when I did take them I took them purely to trip balls and get completely off my dinosaur. Safe to say they definitely done the trick. They scared the shit out of me and I never took them again.

I have however grown up A LOT since those early days and I feel drawn to shrooms once again, except this time I look to them purely as teachers and tools I can use to explore my mind as well as the very nature of reality. 

I plan to grow my own shrooms. I have ordered a mushroom growing kit and I will be ordering spores at the weekend. Can anyone recommend a particular strain? I am in england so I will have to order spores from a UK site. I plan to ease myself in gradually, just using small enough doses to induce a mild trip and increasing the doses as I feel the need to, if indeed I feel the need to. I am not looking for a hugely  powerful trip at the moment.

One problem is that I am doing this alone. I have people who would sit with me while I trip but I would very much like someone to trip with me. All of my friends have the standard preconceived and socially demonized view of mushrooms. I have tried explaining the many benefits of taking hallucinogenic mushrooms, stoned ape theory and many other ideas about the nature of mushrooms themselves and the roles they may play in our existence but to no avail. Does anyone have any links to good information that challenges the standard view that mushrooms are evil, dangerous and must be avoided at all costs?

Cheers!

1375143387.0	1jbbnd	Has anyone here trancended anxiety thanks to shrooms?	Duckbill_Platypus_91	13	2	1	"Over the past few years I have dealt with crippling anxiety, well its gotten a bit better now that I get out of my house more and hang with chums. But I have whats called brain fog (I cant think clearly) and I get panic attacks often. I have read many stories and there has been some studdies pointing towards mushrooms being a good one time long term treatment for certain mental disorders.

I ordered a growing kit a few weeks ago and I now have them drying out. I have never taken mushrooms before and I dont quite know what to expect. I feel as if it is either going to be the most important experience of my life or it can make matters worse.

After listing to alot of Timothy Leary's talks I do feel confident I will flow through the trip confidently and peacefully, but there is still that slight fear, the ""What if?""

Edit: While I was checking on my shrooms to see if they were nice and crisp I decided to nibble on a peice. Not a big one, just a small one.

What then happened over the course of 30 mins I felt this sorta trance like state take over. I wasnt sure if it was placeebo. I still feel it sorta infact. But while in this state its almost like I lost control in a way. I was doing stuff I dont normally do and looking at the strangest things. But everytime I would look at things its like I would focus right in on it, I would just be like woah! Almost like metaphorical black holes sucking me into whats going on around me. Anyway my anxiety felt minimal. I enjoyed the state. And still am from what it is. Just a very very light high it seems. But I love it! Things are just soo calm. I actually layed in the grass outside for a bit and walked down by the water side. I loved the waves just splashing against the shore line. And off in the distance I could see light houses blinking. I live right by lake ontario. Anyway I am going off topic. This is really neat. I think I am going to put some music on. And take a higher dose in about a weeks time."	t5_2qszq	True

This past Sunday afternoon after smoking with some friends I wanted to see what my first mushroom would feel like from my first batch.  It wasn't a fully grown mushroom, probably just a few grams wet.  I didn't really notice a difference since I was already high, but come Sunday night, I was getting worried because the numbness/tingly feeling wasn't going away.  Monday morning was no different.  Even worse, I had to go to work and pretend everything was normal, even though it was incredibly difficult to focus and even talk.  I was very paranoid someone would notice, and it was not pleasant.  Tuesday I still had the same feeling, but I was able to concentrate and had control over my mind.  Today, the tingly feeling is still there, just slightly less intense as it was the first night.

Has this happened to anybody else?  I've searched all over and can't seem to find anybody else this happened to.  I don't have a history of mental or physical problems, but I will say that I've smoked only a few times in my life, and the first time 2 puffs put me in a completely different world, unable to function.

So... I usually use trees, but my friend found some [Deleted to follow the rules] we got three grams. split them among 4 friends at about .75g each.

So we chilled out in a room and ate them with lemonade. I was told that they are awful, but they tasted pretty good to be honest. the texture was nasty, however, and they got stuck in my teeth.

We smoked a couple of bowls and relaxed for about an hour, but not much happened other than getting high, so we went to our backyard and talked while the others smoked cigs. I grabbed some peanut butter.

suddenly, I noticed that the sky was flat. Not like a dome, but flat. with clouds on another flat layer. There was also some quiet techno playing in my ears. looked down into the peanut butter and there was a dragon crafted in the swirls. showed them to the others and they saw different things. dragons, warriors, tidal waves, a whole art show in one tub of peanut butter.

at about that time, I felt that we were getting loud, and wanted to go in, but the music stopped when I went inside, like I was leaving the world. We did eventually go in, and that's when the crazy stuff started happening. I felt the need to go into the bathroom, turn off the lights, and rest in the tub, but I saw dead people and writhing monsters in my mind. strangely, though, I wasn't scared, for it was all rainbow colored and I knew that this was my Id. 

My Ego drew me to my friends for more entertainment and I found them in one of their rooms (we all live together) listening to techno in the dark watching Gordon Ramsay prepare food. The music matched with the show perfectly. My fiance was on the floor commenting about how she needs to feel better about herself and make comic strips, while another friend was staring at the screen. My other friend was having sex with her boyfriend, who had stuck with trees. 

Suddenly i felt a twang, and felt the love of the world. I found the source of the love: a bean bag chair. ""I love Pillow!"" I shouted, and hugged it for some time. 

After my friends left, I continued hugging the pillow and tried to follow them, but I had become a slug. The beanbag was my belly. Luckily, the third friend found me and we went into her room with her boyfriend, smoked some trees, and chilled out, as I had become a snail. The beanbag was now my shell.

I got lonely for my fiance, and left the beanbag (a mistake, as i will tell you later) on a quest to find her. I found her and my friend and took them upstairs, but she had to pee and my second friend took the beanbag!

""Pillow you whore!"" I shouted (mind you, i was chattering away the whole time, but i will only put important stuff in quotes), but it was to no avail. the pillow was his now. We watched some music videos, including something called post-rap, and some angry music, which was really cool. Then I played the [Pucca song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb946g2yOig) (it's one of the happiest songs ever). We all loved it. at that time, they got tired so my fiance went into our room, ordered pizza, and watched stuff until we got tired and slept. I don't remember my dreams. This is not everything, but it is all I remember.

After report: My cheeks hurt from smiling so much, I'm kinda tired, and my throat hurts from talking. My fiance got over her self-image issues. Everyone is feeling good.

1366578606.0	1ctkbx	First time trip report, and the best night of my life	CJrox	12	3	7	"Yesterday on 4/20, 1 year anniversary of my friend's first time smoking pot, 2 of my friends and I all decided to do shrooms.

We had put together like $80 bucks or something and bought 4 Peanut Butter and Chocolate shroom cups, they were split with one friend and I getting 1 1/2 cups and the other friend only wanted 1. Now, the start of this experience was honest to god awful. To myself, the chocolates tasted so bad that I could barely stomach them and nearly puked with each bite, but I suffered through them (oddly enough the guy who only had 1 was the only of us who actually liked them. Us and our sitter then sat around in my friend's house for like an hour playing guitar hero and just relaxing. At the time I didn't feel anything, aside from wanting to throw up, but as time went on I started feeling slightly more happy and a few colors would be more vibrant than before. Both my friends felt the effects before myself as they began to just run around and just have a fun time but I still felt relatively normal.
After about 2 hours I and the friend who's house we were at decided that we felt relatively normal and wanted to go smoke a bowl to see how we felt after that, we then traversed out to our other friends car and began to smoke.

During our time in the car we spent maybe 5 minutes out of 30+ smoking, and were constantly getting distracted by each other. This is where our actual trip started, it took us a while to realize it, but we were starting to peak actually and we spent our time in the car going on about how much we mean to each other as friends, and how the 3 of us are like family to each other, and other such things. After our sitter checked in on us a few times we headed back indoors.

Earlier in the night we had set up a really cool lamp that had 5 small lamps on it, each with a different color shade on it. Unfortunately only 3 of the lamps were working, and we compared them to us as friends, and how cool it was. Then Friend 1 (guy who's house we were at) was going on about how cool the blue one was even though it didn't work, and then while explaining this he moved it to stand straight up and compare it to our sitter and how he watched over us when suddenly it turned on. This, as simple as it was, was utter fascinating and mindblowing to the three of us and we sat there laughing and in awe. And then friend 1 was waving his arms around and accidentally hit the not working lamp with his arm as the blue went out and it turned back on.

Most of the night continued with shenanigans, we later sat down and just talked while friend 2 played acoustic guitar. At some point in time we sat in our friends twin bed all together and just relaxed with each other.

I've got to admit that shrooms were nothing like what I expected, and its not something you can really explain. As my friend put it, ""It's just like Plato's allegory to the cave in which the man sees fire and the creation of shadows and can't think of a way to explain it to people who haven't experienced it."" That was exactly what the experience felt like. (One of the coolest things was closing my eyes and seeing pure colors float around in my mind). I will never be exactly who I was before shrooms, but I will never regret it either, ever subtle change feels for the better.

TL;DR: I tried shrooms with my friends and aside from awful taste and nearly puking I had the greatest and most eye-opening/lifechanging and power experiences of my life."	t5_2qszq	True
1365710703.0	1c5np2	Frozen shroom peanut butter sandwich?	muchmadness	13	3	2	"A couple of months ago (Edit: Actually four months ago), I made peanut butter sandwiches with shrooms for my girlfriend and myself.  The plan was to eat half, wait an hour, and eat the other half.  After the first hour, though, we realized that we in no way needed the rest of the shrooms.  So we did what seemed logical at the time: we put the remaining halves of our sandwiches in a tupperware and stuck them in the freezer.

Now I have frozen shroom peanut butter sandwiches.  I know you can freeze peanut butter sandwiches and they're still edible, and I know you can freeze dried shrooms and they're still edible.  So it should be fine to eat these, right?

We all took an eighth for our first experience (We later realized that this was maybe too big of a dosage).. this following story is about one of my friends that did it with us and I feel like this is important with any drug to know that it can have a negative effect and it should be respected. He weighed the least. Lets just call my friends S and the other A (A is the one who this whole ordeal happened too)

*Scroll all the way down for a shorter version, however, I recommend reading this all if you have time*

In the beginning, we all started feeling kind of funny. It resembled more of a marijuana high than anything, we were giggly, our pupils started to dilate. Nothing was really wrong and we seemed like we were about to have a good time. About 25 minutes in, we started seeing the floor breathe and it was pretty cool. I remember my friend A saying: ""I feel like I should be in a hospital bed"" which was obviously weird for him to say, but we discredited it as a joke. He started acting kind of weird, not willing to explore the house with me and S and just sat in the couch with 2 other people who were just drinking and playing cards and another person who was ""babysitting"" us on our first experience. After about 10 more minutes, me and S go into his mother's bedroom to look at ourselves in the mirror; we looked beautiful. A comes in the room and says he needs to lay down and he keeps asking me if the effects go away if he just sleeps but I tell him no. I start to get a little worried about him as I see he is not really enjoying it and he's starting to think the trip is going to get bad (If you think it, it will happen) but I try not to make it bother me because I really felt already I was fighting for my sanity as it kicked more and more in (If one bad thought took over my mind, I knew I would've had a panic attack or anything) so I just said It's okay A, just lay in the bed for 10 minutes and close your eyes and calm down and then come talk to us. He did so and me and S decide to go to the basement while our friend who is babysitting us (lets call him P) said he would check on him in 10 minutes. Meanwhile me and S were in the basement, my friend P goes check on A. The lights in the room are all turned off and he is no longer in the bed. P checks the bathroom where he finds him naked in front of a mirror. He was shocked, but he did not think it was anything dangerous, just a bad trip; later we realized it was much more. A walked into the kitchen after my friend P talked to him in the bathroom. My friend P followed him around and noticed he had grabbed scissors which raised concern. Before P could do anything, my A friend takes the scissors and thrusts them as hard as he can in his chest and makes a weird grunting noise and my friend P stops him and takes the scissors and removes all sharp objects(please note that I was not aware of this happening as I was downstairs) and asks him why he did it to which he replied ""I need to die. I need to have sex right now. P, don't ever lose your girlfriend, have children"". P is obviously concerned with his state of mind at the time and takes him downstairs to talk to us. A walks in the room in the basement which where me and S are, acting very normal and apologetic about not exploring with us beforehand. Me and S feel relieve. He asks us the time and we tell him it is 11  and he said ""oh okay, that early"" --- This is the last thing that he said that night that made sense. Two seconds after, he takes of ALL his clothes and runs to me begging me to have sex with him (I'm bisexual and he knows it, but he's completely straight) -- I tell him no, what's wrong man? ... I made eye contact and I could see that my friend was no longer in the room. Something *else* took over him. He bolted upstairs, my friend P following him closely and me and S stayed downstairs in shock, not knowing how to react and we start talking until we hear this VERY loud bang. We run upstairs and see that the window is completely shattered; he had jumped THROUGH the window, landing on a AC unit on ground level, completely bending its shape. I did not see him jump out the window (thank god, I would have lost my sanity) but I saw him run up to the deck right next to  where he landed and he ran up the deck stairs to the thick glass deck door and he slams his body to the door, breaking this extremely thick glass. I could see the glass cut him, I could see it so clearly (Please know that I'm already really out of it due to the combination of potent shrooms and a larger dosage than I never should've taken).. I could see it go in his skin and cut him and he kept going and going on the door, trying to break the second layer of glass. I see my friend P appear from the dark outside and grab him and try to apprehend him in vain (my friend P is a HUGE dude, and it was amazing to see a 130lb 6ft guy getting out of P's grip) -- Seeing that he was struggling with apprehending A, I yell at my very drunk friend who is also rather big to go outside and help (lets call him G). Him and P picked A up and brought him into the garage. He was yelling obscenities, talking about how we had to find someone to have sex with so he would be good for tomorrow. He also shouted obscenities about jesus, god and devils. I was in utter shock, my body was shaking and everything seemed like it was falling apart so I removed myself from the situation and went to the kitchen to avoid looking at A because It was literally making me lose my sanity. In about 20 seconds, A gets loose in the garage and runs out of it, straight into the kitchen which where I was. Now just imagine how I felt. My friend, literally COVERED in blood from the cuts is running towards me with a facial expression that could not possibly belong to anything human. In my state of mind I did not know what to do, I knew that he was not going to hurt me, but he was trying to kill himself. I ended up grabbing him and tackling him to the floor. He instantly calmed down and did not fight my grip at all so I changed my grab more into a hug-level grab than a tackle. He was sitting on the kitchen floor, covered in blood with my arms around him and I told him ""A, it's okay. It's going to be okay. Just come back to reality. Be with me, I'm here."" and he says ""I know it's okay. Just have sex with me please. I just need sex so I can be good tomorrow""... he said this with a very calming voice (which was a relief as he had been yelling) and I could see some of my friend A return in his face. P and G now took him to the shower to clean him up (he was very calm there) and get him ready to go to the hospital but it was too dangerous to drive with him if he flipped out again so we called a bunch of people at like 1 in the morning to come help and hold him down while we drove there. He had calmed down and looked more now as he was just tripping, not having a case of psychosis. But, when he got the hospital, he completely flipped and went back to his previous state, yelling at the nurses to please have sex with him. They tied him down and tried to calm him. Me and S did not go to the hospital and we were at home right now alone because everyone else went to help with A in the hospital and there was no space in the car. The trip now reached its maximum capacity for us. The house was covered in blood. Bloody footsteps, blood marks, blood blood blood blood.... Just think in a mind of someone who took too much of shrooms, just held his bloody friend down because he was going to kill himself, saw him run through a glass door cutting himself. Something in me started breaking. I could feel my mind starting to make that transition into insanity and S was on the floor, staring at something, not speaking a word. I said to myself ""This is where you have to fight. This is where you have to be strong. This is a test. If you fail, you might die and your friend S might too. Be strong. Focus"" --- After telling myself that, I focused on counting 8 seconds and after that I took a small sip of water from the sink and I repeated this for a long time. It helped me to calm down enough to realize that we should remove ourselves from that floor and go to the basement and lock ourselves into the bathroom. We did that. My friend S was freaking out, having emotional fits where he cried histerically and then went on a rampage breaking things. I was so scared. I did not know the definition of fear until this. I have never felt this bad in my life before (I have a history of sexual abuse, and this was nothing compared to it and I would've taken that abuse repeatidly instead of going through this) and I was thinking about killing myself, but, I told myself that it would only make things worse.... So, I commanded my friend to sit down and not say a word. I talked for 40 minutes straight while my thoughts raced ""Your friend A is dead, you guys are not worth it"" while my words spoken to my friend S were the opposite of my thoughts ""This is okay, S. We will fix everything. We will. He's fine"" -- Me speaking the opposite of my mind helped me, and my friend as he listened to me speak and try to calm him down. Now, after me talking for those 40minutes he told me to be quiet now because he wanted to listen to music. During one song he said ""God is with us tonight"", as an atheist I don't believe in god, but, those words brought the biggest comfort to me as I was literally battling my own mind for my sanity. I could feel myself begin to crack but focusing on good thoughts was what was keeping me alive. I really wanted to turn back to the bad thoughts (my friend is dead, it is not going to be okay, this is going to cost you so much in every way, etc etc) but the thought of God guiding us through this helped me cope with it. Now, another friend of ours comes (Call him M) and checks us out and he seems extremely calm to me, almost scary calm and that's where I recall he had been drinking. He told us to come upstairs and we complied as we could feel like we were starting to sober up, but we were still heavily under the effects. the guy had washed all the blood except in one place, the bathroom where he took a shower, which I just happened to stumble in to because I had to pee so I had to remove myself from that and I was too scared to go into any other bathroom in the house by myself so I peed in the sink. Now other people that went to the ER start coming over and telling us that he's okay, physically, and that we should not worry. We later visited him in the ER and he was himself but occasionally said incoherent things (that chair has been up and down five times, I counted!) and he said that it was not our fault and so on and so on. The relieved feeling was indescribable. My friend A is now released from the ER and is receiving some psychological care from professionals. Me and S are the ones who stayed overnight in the ER with his family and we all talked about A and what happened -- We realized that he had been lying to all of us (he doesn't do that, he is the most kind hearted kid I know and he never lies) about somethings that did not make sense and we later figured out that the issues he had been having recently were a lot more serious than we thought. I didn't sleep for 48 hours, didn't really eat either due to the trauma I went through. However, my family and my friends and even their families have been super supportive and have helped us a lot. After this experience, I threw away $500 worth of marijuana stuff (vaporizer, weed, grinder, etc etc) and ALL the alcohol I just bought (about $60) and promised myself I would never do drugs again unless perhaps a beer in a very safe environment with adults around such as my parents. These drugs aren't particular *bad* drugs, but, it all depends on the user, it can still be abused, it can still have terrible effects beyond imagination. I am glad I threw the drugs away because I had been dealing with depression and I had been drinking and smoking weed out of control to deal with it. I am glad I got this from my experience and me and my friends have never been closer. All I ask you guys is to be careful and if you feel like you're using drugs for the wrong reasons (Even the virtually harmless MJ!) you can be at risk for something bad.** Just PLEASE be careful, I do not wish this upon my worst enemy. I love you all.**


*Short version*
I just held down one if my best friends down on the floor in a pool of blood as he was fighting my friends like a wild animal because he was trying to kill himself. he jumped through a window (he didn't open the window, he jumped THROUGH IT) and landed on the AC on the ground outside, ran up stairs on the deck and broke the glass on the on the deck door, cutting himself all over with glass then trying to stab himself with scissors and then he tried to get me to have sex with him. He said he couldn't feel anything. drugs. The actual experience of this is 100 worse than you think it was. thankfully we had great people there come help and strap him down in the car and drive him to the hospital. i talked to his step family and we both realized that he has major psychological issues that we never realized until now. however, he is now safe and just got released from the ER.

BE CAREFUL. 


P.S - I have been dealing with this reasonable well, but, if anyone has had anything similar happen, what did you do? I don't know what to do. I am most likely going to counseling. 

Edit: so many errors and confusing sentences.

IMPORTANT EDIT: EDIT 2: there are people saying that I'm a complete idiot and what I did was stupid and I should've done this and that. I know this. Trust me, you don't have to tell me. I learned my lesson. I almost saw my bestfriend die in front of me. It is illogical to say ""You should've done this, you should've done that blah blah you are so stupid"" -- At the time we had NO idea what we were getting into so expecting us to be smart in a time where we were the stupidest we have ever been (to not research or plan this out ahead of time) is not something you can expect. ""We are all doing better and we all feel very strong after this experience. It was like god slapped us into reality. No more lies, no more excuses, no more going around the facts. We were stupid, we paid the price and we have to face that. No lies. We told our parents - Something that would had never occurred to me happening before and they were VERY supportive, but still disappointed."" --"	t5_2qszq	True

Some background: I have anxiety about everything and theres some depression too. I was once, briefly medicated for it but im really not bad. I guess what im trying to say is im pretty much your average girl but I worry a little bit too much and sometimes feel lost. I took the shrooms hoping to do a little self discovery and introspection, as well as have a nice trip (not my first time taking them but my first time solo). I had a fantastic (visually and mentally!) Experience with them and I feel changed. It'd take way too long to spell out exactly how but in short I feel more comfortable with myself, like I know myself a little bit better, and like I'm less worried in general.

I'm going to be doing 'shrooms this afternoon, and I wanted some advice on 'shroom tea. 

I'm fairly experience with mushrooms in general, but I'm a bit dubious of mushroom tea. I've performed the lemon tek both successfully and unsuccessfully in the past, and I really don't want to screw this up, as these are some of the strongest mushrooms I've ever had, and to waste them would be criminal. 

So, I've read various recipes and people always seem to advocate the tea as one of the best methods. Quick come up, nice peak, quick comedown. Chop up the mushies, get some water that's near boiling, throw the mushies in, let sit for 15 minutes, drink, trip. 

Now here are my questions:
1) Do I  need to add anything to the tea in addition to water? I don't care too much about taste, I'm asking more as a method of extraction - I know the lemon tek works because its pre-digests the mushrooms in an acidic environment, but with water it doesn't seem like anything would occur.

2) I've read a lot about doing washes of the 'shrooms, as in seeping them several times. Does anyone know if this is actually worth it or effective in any way?

3) Can I finely chop up the 'shrooms and then put them in tea bags and staple them back together?

Thanks for your answers guys!

1338498115.0	uehhl	My tale of the forest	benwaaaaaaaah	12	1	2	"First I'd like to start by saying Hello /r/shrooms ! This is my first visit to your community and I surely don't want it to be my last. 

I had an amazing experience in the forests of northern Arizona last weekend and would like to share a small bit. I was up there with my girl and part of her family to spread the ashes of her recently deceased grandparents. We arrived Saturday mid-day and I started drinking some beers while my girl was drinking some Jack/Coke's. After we got camp setup everyone was drinking, BSing and having a good time overall. Her uncle offered me a 7mg Vicodin and I, being then gentleman that I am, accepted. About 30 minutes later, I was feeling pretty high on life and that's when I was offered shrooms.

One of her family members busted out a Tupperware container about 75% full of this magical fungi. Her and I (her first time doing shrooms and my second) both took decent size handfuls and munched them then washed them down with some H2O. This was around 5 pm. I would say they took about 20 minutes for me to start feeling them. It first started with a very light feeling. It felt as if my head and body weighed a lot less than it actually did. It felt great!!! 30-40 mins into the beginning stages of the trip my girl and I decide to walk the forest. We spent the next 2 hours looking at some of the most amazing images I have ever seen in my lifetime and giggling our asses off!!! I has so much fun. The trees were moving in unison beautifully. The forest ground was bright green from the grass, brown from broken limbs and old fallen trees, white and purple from flowers, and the sky was beginning to turn orange and pink from the sunset. I stood in amazement as I tried to take all of this in. I would get lost looking at the trunk of an old tree that had fallen many years before and hear my girl call me to look at some pretty caterpillar.

I would look at something and just let my mind wander and do what it does and I would lose myself in the most peaceful way ever. I couldn't sit still, I did not want to sit or my stomach would start getting nauseous. I should have eaten. I ate breakfast at 9:30 am, it was now around 7:30 pm and I puked up a bit. It was mainly hash browns, I did not see many mushrooms in it. Yes, I looked, don't judge me.

After her and I got back to camp food was ready, I had 1 bite of a braut, food was not my main concern, staying away from non-tripping people was haha.. Their laughter / shit-talking to each other and drunkenness made it  a hard environment to put myself into. So we stood at the front of her truck laughing, talking about how we were feeling, what we were seeing and all that good stuff. I am pretty positive we saw Mars and Venus in the night sky, there were 2 VERY bright ""stars"" that were red and vibrant. I stared at the starts for at least an hour. She said she couldn't look up anymore because she was getting cold, lol her hoodie kept falling off when she looked up is all. We saw a satellite zoom across the star filled night sky, that was pretty amazing. We finally went to bed around 10:30.

Before we crashed out I had to poo... So I take my flashlight and make the trek to our makeshift shitter in the wood. I came equipped with a .45 ACP handgun because of uhm, bears and other nightly creatures that want to eat me... Mainly just bears though. I can honestly say that was a pretty scary moment of my life. I freaked myself out a little bit because I knew I was tripping, but I was under total control mentally. It was pretty funny now that I look back at it. I didn't know EXACTLY where the tarp was so I was kind of just walking really slow and looking around a lot. I would hear a **crunch**  **crunch** every so often that freaked me out a little bit but I finally figured out was my footsteps breaking old twigs! lol.. I pooped, made it back to the tent and washed my hands then proceeded to sleep for about 7 hours. I woke up in the AM feeling great, no hangover, no weird dreams, had a great day after that.

Her family member that offered them is having a birthday party tomorrow the 1st, so I am going to go for that and hopefully get to do some more! I had an awesome time, no regrets!!!! Oh, she did too :) Thanks for reading this! I just want to add a little something for people out there to relate to and share my experience."	t5_2qszq	True
1331872736.0	qyyji	Hello r/shrooms. I just ordered some spores and a Mycobag, and have a couple of questions. 	Godimhigh	13	3	5	"After a couple days of (spring break nothing to do) research, I have understood the process pretty well of how to grow. 

I bought 12ccs of B+ spores (another thread here said they were a good first time spore) and a pre-sterilized Mycobag from themadseason.com, the [mad bag](http://themadseason.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=1&amp;products_id=17). It seems like a very easy way to go about it and convenient for me. 



[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/ntqqr/any_experienced_mushroom_growers_here/c3elpwg) post, which the account was deleted) suggests putting compost in, and I have found a few shroomery posts about adding High Mountain Compost to the bag when it is time to fruit. 

My questions:

How much HMC?

Do I add water to it or just add the HMC and seal it back up with medical tape, then keep it on the 12/12 schedule? 

Thank you!

I still love this girl, but she says I've changed and I've stopped caring about her.. but she doesn't understand how stressful and unmotivated I've been. 

I'm planning on doing 3-4 grams ALONE in my house on a Friday or Saturday night because the first time I did shrooms I went into this deep thought mode where I pretty much figured so much about my life that was problematic, and came out of that trip a better person. I saved a friendship with my best friends, and changed bad habits.

My main question, is this a good idea? I don't want to have a bad trip, but I plan on having a notepad on me where I can record all my thoughts. I'm doing this purely to save a relationship that I think I'm fucking up with an amazing girl I love, and also just reflect on my life as a whole.

We had wanted to for a long time and so on a beautiful sunny Saturday we decided it was the right time. We walked around our campus until we found the perfect spot, it was an area near the woods, close to a cow pasture overlooking the ocean. When we got there each of the 4 of us took an eighth. Before it hit us we just hiked around, climbed trees and swung from an old rope swing. Then suddenly BAM colors seemed more vibrant, everything seemed to be breathing and talking to me. I received the best vibes from the Earth and everything around me. I walked towards the pasture and saw the field and ocean and I began to cry because of the beauty of it all. It was the most perfect experience ever. At one point I ""talked"" with Mother Nature and I contemplated existence a lot. I realized that it's the greatest thing to just exist as an animal or flower does. No rush, no work, no school, simple existence. I cried like never before, I cried at my sudden and complete happiness through simplicity, I cried because I was sharing the moment with the best people I know, and I cried because everything felt so perfect. There were brief moments when I would start to panic or freak out but my friends where there to calm me down. The come down was amazing also. We hiked back to my friends apartment and all laid on her floor talking about life and our dreams. Later we went out to a diner and just stayed there for a while. It's been a while since this happened but I can't wait to experience it again. The only thing I didn't really enjoy is that I kept thinking I was peeing myself but I hear that's normal.

I live in Lafayette, Louisiana. Or if you would like me to be more general, I live in the region known as Acadiana. See [map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Acadiana_parishes_map.png) for reference.

Getting into specifics, I live on a farm with considerable pastured areas that house a good amount of cows. They poop a lot. Now, I had read that cow patties were a possible source for psilocybin mushrooms. Most sources seemed to corroborate this. I picked the mushrooms from a patty that was in the process of decomposing, if that's relevant at all.

####Weather

It rained for quite a bit on Thursday, Saturday, and Monday. The ground was still wet when I went out and there were a few pools of water in uneven areas of the field.

####Pictures

I tried my best to get a clear pictures that captured anything important. If the pictures are of poor quality or not useful I apologize.

[Picture 1](http://i.imgur.com/dAVMwAv.jpg) and [Picture 2](http://i.imgur.com/vAaWsvs.jpg)

You'll notice some of them a crushed a bit. After picking them I put them in my pocket and went to herd cattle (seriously). That's why they got smushed. 

Now according to [this](http://www.shroomery.org/8461/Which-psilocybin-mushrooms-grow-wild-in-my-area) the mushrooms that grow wild in my area are:

#

* Gymnopilus junonius

* Panaeolus cinctulus

* Panaeolus cyanescens

* Psilocybe caerulescens

* Psilocybe cubensis

I looked up pictures of these for comparison, and I wasn't very encouraged. Maybe P. cubensis or P. cyanescens, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's just a common mushroom, who knows?

Anyways, thanks in advance for any helpful and informative comments.

NobodysNose	8	0	11	"Recently finished my first flush, and, as I wiped their bottoms of dried verm, took notice of a white, fluffy fuzz around the base of many of the boomers. On a few of them it had begun a slow creep up the stalk, but never got farther than a quarter of the way up. I used a small electric razor cleaning brush to brush the bottoms and this seemed to clean off most of the fluzz. 

What is this fuzzin' stuff? 

I get the feeling that it is the result of too much moisture content in the FC. Need confirmation, though, and some solutions. Right now I am misting once, maybe twice, a day depending on Rh and H in FC. Fanning at a 2-4 hour interval, basically whenever I get a free moment in my day.

1361480820.0	18z6nh	I need some more experienced insights...	TheManInTheIronMask	10	4	9	"So a few weeks ago a friend of mine tried shrooms for the first time. I have some experience with booms and have been around many friends who have also done them and offered to hang out while he and another friend tried them. They each took an eighth and starting feeling the effects pretty quickly so I offered to drive them up a nearby canyon and to a lookout spot. Everything seemed fine and they were enjoying themselves and after about two hours we were back at my house. At this point I could tell they were fairly anxious about when the trip would be ending and so I decided to watch some TV to help them get their minds off of it. The first friend decided to stay in my room. After about five minutes of watching Regular Show with the second friend the friend in my room walked across the room and headed upstairs without a word. This was at almost three hours after ingestion. My second friend followed him up and immediately returned saying he was fine. I thought he had headed out to get some cold air but followed him just to make sure. By this time he was already in his car. I chased after him but to no avail. Immediately I texted him and called him but no answer. I went back downstairs and found his coat and shoes. After another friend joined us we went and checked out his house to make sure he had gotten home safely and his car was there so we figured there wasn't much we could do at this point. Worst case he had run into his parents. We got back to my house again and found his phone behind a chair in my room. Soon after we got a call from his parents on his phone and found out what had happened. He had gone home, been there for some time while his parents were still out, decided to leave with his dog, took his dad's truck and drove up the road. He sideswiped a car drove off the road through a fence and a few small trees almost hitting a pedestrian. When we got there we told our story but it was clear that the police thought I was some kind of drug dealer. (which I'm not) He got very lucky and only received a citation for reckless driving thanks to a generous and understanding officer. His parents returned home after he left thinking the house had been broken into. They heard from a neighbor that their son was up the street in an accident. That's when they called his phone to tell us what happened.

After talking to him recently he said the last thing he remembered was driving back to my house and then later laying at his house thinking he was dead. Most of the night he remembers nothing about...complete blackout. 

Sorry for the length but I was just wondering what you guys think happened? Why it happened? On a side note, this friend is generally a lightweight when it comes to drugs. Thanks a lot for any insight. "	t5_2qszq	True

We marveled when we discovered there are organisms living entire lives, being born, taking in and converting matter, reproducing, and dying, and they are too small to see with the naked eye.  Our curiosity has lead us onward.  A series of the question, “Yes, but what is THAT made of?” and the tiniest sliver of cosmic time has us discovering the emergent properties (properties that become more apparent as you ‘zoom in’) of quantum particles and how their interaction gives tangibility to the world and universe around us.    You know what we discovered?  It’s mostly empty space.  To provide perspective, if you take all of the empty space out of the empire state building, you would have an object the size of a marble, but weighing many millions of tons.  ..  Nothing is there.  Our bodies, and most importantly, our brains to which many accredit our consciousness is mostly empty space.  Energetically vibrating energy with voids of vacuum around it, whatever that means.

I feel we can drill down as long as we’d like, and we’ll continue to find *poof*!  Barely anything there.

I believe the language we use when describing events is a key to finding connectivity when there is none apparent.  Using the same word to describe both events and sensation is the key, I believe, to understanding more regarding the nature of our existence.  An example, yes, yes.

Vibration is used to describe a feeling of motion we feel physically.  It is also used to describe a state of being of an object, i.e., that guitar string is vibrating.  It is also used to describe a state of being of a person, i.e. “He/She had a bad/good vibe.”  Closely related and worth consideration for addition to this thought ball, “We are on the same/different wavelengths”, “I’m feeling your vibe”, “[Take the action] and ride the wave”, “I’m buzzed”, “Raise your vibration”, etc etc.

Nearly every sense you use as a human to build your picture of the world around you makes use of incoming waves.  Light waves for sight, audio waves for sound, electron field waves for touch (you don’t actually ever touch other matter, the electrons that compose you and the electrons that compose the matter repel each other).  Smell is based on the receipt of aromatic particles that are themselves vibrating.

In our biosphere, there are plenty of animals using waves and vibrations that we do not process to build their picture, and interact with their environment.  We learned that honey bees use micro-frequency waves to navigate.  We learned this when we placed micro-frequency cell towers near bee colonies and they started dying off or abandoning their hive.  We know that homing pigeons make detailed maps in their mind using ultra-low frequency sound waves, and that is how they navigate home.   Elephants are able to communicate across miles using ultra low frequency, sound waves which we cannot hear.

One of the most recent discoveries that astounds me most is one that I saw in the documentary, “Resonance, Beings of Frequency”.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV9dhGv_tTs.  It turns out that the earth has a ‘pulse’, or a ‘frequency’.  If you imagine the earth as one sphere and the ionosphere as another sphere and calculate the tension between the two, you arrive at a frequency.  10 Hertz.  This is a measurable frequency which surrounds life on earth.  Are you ready for the 2×4 to the face?  Your alpha brain waves also are measured at 10 hertz.

Ok, so everything is vibrating, our mental construction of our environments are based on waves and vibrations, there is a lot of data in terms of waves that are constantly interacting with our bodies, and we only really consciously perceive a fraction of the input.  What does this have to do with tripping and emergent properties of reality?

Have you ever been under the influence of a psychedelic and have seen the walls breathing, or wood grain moving, or patters on a tile swirling?  This is pretty much a rhetorical question, if you’ve taken psychedelics and haven’t seen these things you haven’t taken enough. This is a standard occurrence of my trips, and most trip reports I’ve read or heard.  So what’s it about?  If Psilocin was causing an ‘error’ as critics portray, then why is it exactly the same error for so many?  I thought it was just one more thing about the psychedelic experience that was far from being understood, and who knows when a brilliant scientist will find this specific answer.

Then I saw this Ted Talk: http://www.ted.com/talks/aaron_o_connell_making_sense_of_a_visible_quantum_object.html

Aaron O’Connell, theoretical physicist, performed an experiment where he made a device which has the ability to be in a quantum position.  Essentially they built a computer chip around a microscopic piece of metal so they could create a vacuum, super-cool the metal, remove all light, and still measure the metals movement.  It turns out that when all stimuli (photons, heat, other partials and gasses) were removed, the object began to MOVE!  “In weird ways” he says.  “It wasn’t sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating.  And it was BREATHING!” he goes on.

WHOAH!  I jumped immediately to, well, that’s the way things really are, and psychedelics let you see that.  I even made that statement to a friend who told me that I was crazy, there was no proof, and you better not say that again to other people.  Challenge accepted to at least try to make someone want to design a test for this.

I propose for the collective unconscious to work on the following idea:  Psychedelics allow an individual to consciously process more of the sensory input which we receive every day and in every way. The increase in consciousness is the result of the molecular displacement of the neurotransmitter serotonin by the neurotransmitter psilocin, and something changes regarding the bandwidth of the data stream.

A lofty thing to try to prove.  Well, I’ve begun the baseline work to show that there is something there to be proven (apart of course from ingesting psychedelics, then you absolutely know that there is something there worth inspecting).  The effects of psilocybe cubensis mushrooms come from the dephosphorylation of psilocybin to psilocin, which passes the blood brain barrier and interacts directly with the 5HT2A receptor neurons which normally operate using the neurotransmitter serotonin.

If you look at a psilocin molecule and a serotonin molecule side by side, you will notice not too much is different.


Serotonin in the brain (5HT Receptor Sites)

“The neurons of the raphe nuclei are the principal source of  5-HT release in the brain.[67] There are 7 or 8 raphe nuclei (some scientists chose to group the raphe linearis nuclei into one nucleus), all of which are located along the midline of the brainstem, and centered around the reticular formation.[68] Axons from the neurons of the raphe nuclei form a neurotransmitter system, reaching almost every part of the central nervous system. Axons of neurons in the lower raphe nuclei terminate in the cerebellum and spinal cord, while the axons of the higher nuclei spread out in the entire brain.”

It seems as though the 5HT family is responsible for a lot of stuff.  Let’s drill down into the emergent property.  Notice above that the nuclei responsible for the 5HT interactions are “Centered around the reticular formation”.  Form and function in human anatomy are closely related.  Let’s see where this takes us.

The Reticular Formation

“The reticular formation is a region in the brainstem that is involved in multiple tasks such as regulating the sleep-wake cycle and filtering incoming stimuli to discriminate irrelevant background stimuli.[1] It is essential for governing some of the basic functions of higher organisms, and is one of the phylogenetically oldest portions of the brain.”

Notice!  “Filtering incoming stimuli”   The reticular formation, working under the influence of serotonin eliminates some incoming stimuli.

“The reticular formation consists of more than 100 small neural networks, with varied functions including the following:

    Somatic motor control – Some motor neurons send their axons to the reticular formation nuclei, giving rise to the reticulospinal tracts of the spinal cord. These tracts function in maintaining tone, balance, and posture–especially during body movements. The reticular formation also relays eye and ear signals to the cerebellum so that the cerebellum can integrate visual, auditory, and vestibular stimuli in motor coordination. Other motor nuclei include gaze centers, which enable the eyes to track and fixate objects, and central pattern generators, which produce rhythmic signals to the muscles of breathing and swallowing.”

Notice! “relays eye and ear signals to the cerebellum so that the cerebellum can integrate visual, auditory, and vestibular stimuli..”

Serotonin gets to choose what makes it in for processing!

“4. Sleep and consciousness – The reticular formation has projections to the thalamus and cerebral cortex that allow it to exert some control over which sensory signals reach the cerebrum and come to our conscious attention.”

Notice! “that allow it to exert some control over which sensory signals reach the cerebrum and come to our conscious attention.”

“5. Habituation – This is a process in which the brain learns to ignore repetitive, meaningless stimuli while remaining sensitive to others.”

Notice!  Above!  :) …ignore repetitive meaningless stimuli – like the constant vibration of all matter around us?

I propose that the way psilocin and serotonin function as neurotransmitters can be compared to frame rate for video speed.   We’re talking about optics (breathing walls, flowing grain, amorphous rugs) so it’s a decent comparison I believe.  Serotonin provides an environment in which your data processing frame rate ‘smooth’s out’ so to speak.  That is to say, walls appear stable and solid, although we know this is not true about the quantum universes that comprise that wall.  Imagine you changed the filter to allow more data to pass and increased the processing frame rate.  On a quantum level, the molecules in the wall, every single one of them, is “breathing” as Allen O’Conner so perfectly put it to make this leap of thought.   Just incredibly fast.

I think, what would happen, if you changed the filter and increased the frame speed is that you would start to see the beginning of this quantum movement.  You would see it as a very slow representation of what it truly is, but the point is, you would be seeing more about the true nature.  The faster you speed up the information processing, the more you see about the truth.

In a study conducted by Dr. Roland Fischer in the 1970’s at John’s Hopkins University, it was conclusively proven that minute doses of psilocybin increased visual acuity.  In the test, there were two parallel bars and the subjects were told to ‘buzz in’ when the bars were no longer parallel.  The findings showed conclusively that those under the influence of very small doses of psilocybin were faster to pick up on when the bars were no longer in sync.

Dr. Fischer was quoted by Terence Mckenna as saying “So here you have the proof that a drug can show you a truer picture of reality”!

Since all of matter is vibratory in nature, could it be proposed that the molecular weight of the neurotransmitter causes it to vibrate faster or slower as a molecule in space time, and that difference makes for the difference in data processing speeds?

I lack the resources, education, and intelligence to design a test to this hypothesis.  I invite the collective unconscious to explore this line of thought and see if there is any validity to it."	t5_2qszq	True

We met up at a friends house at around seven and looked our shrooms over. I think it was a bunch of liberty but really I have no idea.
There were only about 60 in the bags out of the 100 we thought we had bought so we split and ate them anyway.
We called a friend of ours who had more shrooms at his place and we went there and ate a bunch more and something he said were some mexican shrooms.

Then we left his place and thats about 40 minutes after ingesting. 
We were wondering if we still hadn't eaten enough so we decided to go buy some dominos. That it where it started kicking in.
Everything was hilarious. Our sober buddy went in and we tried walking in but had to leave because of uncontrollable fits of laughter.

We went to my friends place and started eating the pizza. It seemed like it took freaking weeks. Time literally stopped.
After a few weeks of pizza we all sat down in the couch and watched a painting for about 40 minutes. It was beautiful. The moving, changing, pulsing colors, wall seemed to move backwards and the house in general was as if it was breathing.
I also noticed how I found dimensions and space between things to be much larger. Like my friends staircase was never that wide before and all kinds of things.
After watching the painting I went downstairs to my friends room. I looked up from his bed and stared at a light bulb for a few minutes and enjoyed the calming visuals and deep thinking.
I had been thinking that entire night, starting from the texture of the car-seat if it had always been this complex, the texture, and if I had just never given myself time to realize it.
By looking at the bulb I felt an immense realization that...
Its very hard to explain but the closest is something like ""Everything is far more complex than we will ever know unless we give ourselves time to deeply inspect and contemplate those things"". 
An intense feeling of calm and serenity then followed. I went to sleep last night with an intense feeling of everything being in its place.   
For me it was amazing. I will do this again sometime.

Oh and also. Friend of mine had that thingy where he wobbled around a bit before limping down. Thought he was dying.
Can anyone explain that? He ate loads of the mexican stuff.

TL;DR = Ate shrooms, realized light bulbs.

This is both our first time and do not know what to expect as we really have only tried weed. 

We weren't sure if there are precautions to take before trying this stuff out (e.g. having a friend who is not tripping, etc.) Besides that, we're ready to try this, and is there anything you guys recommend to do while on a trip? 

Anyways, thanks! The help is much appreciated! "	t5_2qszq	True
1344402535.0	xv7bc	Did shrooms for the 2nd time and wrote 7 pages of text...	2ndTimeShroomer	11	1	7	"Sunday night I decided to try a bit of the shrooms that I just bought... I was alone on the couch.  I'm a male in my 20s in the USA, and I am gainfully employed... here is what I wrote.  BTW, I am aware that it wasn't a pill...



------------


started this trip maybe like 30 minutes ago.  I mean that's when i took the pill.  Right now, i think it would be pretty awesome to get some strippers in here and we just party for a while.... I would totally throw down for some shit like this.  It would require me to clean dhit place up a bit and then cleaning myself up too... which probably shouldln't take that long.  If i want to take m ore mushrooms too, i can probably do that.  The only constraint is that it is a sunday an di have to go to fucking workin th emorning.. i hate work so much, but the plac ehooks me up like crazy.  Im still so lazy though for some reason.... maybe just cuz i love drugs so much

a yways what i was going to say a bit ago was that i have tons of visuals going on.... like fucking weird whirly things happening in 3d.... my eyes are open though and the visuals are happening between this and the computer screen.  They are mostly red and green though, and i keep thinking something is moving next to me on the couch, but I look and no object has changed locations because i'm alone obviously.

Oh i should put this as a field report later on.  Shit, i have to get a bunch of cash though too for these stripers.  Ok now to do some research on strippers

i should also put some music on..

oh man this orange juice is so good right now... very like... antsy and jittery and dancing around sort of... but not like coke.  Coke has too much jitters but gets you going.  This gets you going without of the shitty jitters... sort of like X in that respect, but my mind is going like a mile a minute.  My hands typing cannot keep up with the thoughts in my head, and i'm a 100wpm typer... especially when im not caring about spellling errors or puncuation and shit like right now.  Whoa... this laptop just became ""flatter"" to me for a second.... which is weird cuz its very thin to begin with.  Ok now the volume of the music is too low and i forgot that i have to search for strippers agian...


im really fucking digging these tunes right now though.... some old school trance right now... i'm usually more into deeper stuff though... minimal/tech/progressive house, but i just put the music on a complete ""shuffle"", so we'll see what shows up...

am i becoming a drug addict dude?  Maybe i am... ive been blowing off friends more to just get stoned at home (or just tired from being stoned).  But the thing is before, i was drinking a lot more (with them), which is ""worse"" for your body.... so i dont know.  I think that popelple just go through short phases too so whatever... just live live however you feel in the moment and don't just try to act like what other popele expect you to do.  I fucking enjoy myself, with and without other people.  I wish that things had worked out between me and my ex girlfriend... but she would have never have tried anything like this.  So really, what i wanted was an ideal version of her that she didn't want to be.  I wanted her to be this beautiful, cool, smart, awesome girl, that loves to party all the time... which is obviously why we got toeher in the first place.  At first it was incredible... i was always with her and we loved spending time with each other and fucking all the time... i got her to do some shit for the first time that she hadn't done before

some more modern deep house shit came on and i am grooving out hard.... visuals are still going.... greens and reds.... alsmost like confetti around.  Good times!  I think the volume is up too loud (but my speakers are phenomenal... i dont fuck around... check out the e design audio lineup).  Cheap and fucking sick as hell dude... i recommend tha shit to anyone... i fucking love that company.  I should talk to them and tell them that im interested in them.... fuck thats a good idea.  In fact, there are other companies that i like that i should contact that not; many poeple know about.

Update on... fuck i forgot what i was talking about

dude but fucking music is so awesome... i totally forgot abotu some of these tracks!  I dont get why people dont have better speakers.... most poeple dont care and they listen to fucking

oh yea... update on the visuals... now its making faint like 3d sperical/animal shaped sort of... can't explain it.

Oh yea i sholud totally contact other companies that i think are awesome and maybe i can help them with something cuz i think they do fucking great work..... unlike goddamn my company which i dont give a shit at all about.  I dont give a flying fuck about it, but they pay  me damn well.... but thi sis maily cuz of my boss cuz she has been pretty awesome.  But yea, i dont give a shit at all so i've been blowing off work a bunch and not giving a shit even though i have nothing else lined up, but i know that i can get away with it 

i wish i knew the exact amount of shrooms i took .... i have no fucking idea, i just eyeballed it and did the same amoun as last time (


i just totally forgot what i was thinking about but my mind is going a fucking mile a minute.  I keep listening to old songs i've forgotten about and they are fcuking awesome.  Visuals are like red and green weird things, some in 2d, some in 3d... i want to keep writing for some reason but i hope my battery doesn't run out of battery.... i mean the fucking comcputer doesn't run out of battery.  I just dont want to get off of this fucking couch right now.  Anyways, some viauslas have like weird hebrew fucking words on them sort of... obviously i have no idea what it says .  My mind is just going so fast, and i can't record the shit in my mind as fast as it comes... my ideas like come about then disappear instantly.  Its really fucking weird.  Im definitely tripping harder than i was the first time... but maybe not.... the visuals are more intense this time but i dont feel like i want to get up as much

now the computer is like morphing into weird shit kind of, but as soon as i look away it turns back to normal.  These keys feel like putty in my fingers a bit, but maybe thats just my sweat 

anyways lets fucking have a good time... the boring roommate that is going to ruin our time is not here (i hope he doesn't show up cuz he will find fucking so many drugs and hopefully strippers here in a while)  i want the strippers to have a good time... not necessarily fuck me... lets just fucking party and have a good time... not just like wham bam thank you maaam.... i want to keep getting all these thoughts down

the fucking words and shit are moving around on the screen.... fuck the volume is too loud again.  I think i may have taken a good amount so far.... i just hope it doesn't last too long where i can't get to sleep and fuck up work in temorning.  Anyways, i gotta piss.

Fuck i had so much i wanted to write about while going piss but i forgot all of them... i can't fucking type fast enough jesus christ motherfucker ass dick

some fucking pussy would be legit right now dude... i have the beats for it.... i want some fucking strippers but not the wham bam thnk you maam fucking dirty ones that just get done and fucking, then tehy take your money and leave and complain i didnt give them enough.... i mean i guess she did let a strangers dick inside of her, but she was fucking gross and i couldn't even get it up with her.... i said sorry and paid her off anyways.... would suck if you are tryng to get some dude off (and this is her fucking PROFESSION) and you can't even get the dude hard?  Must totally suck.... i mean she was fucking ugly as hell lets be honest.  Anyways, this music is totally boss and i dont know how long this will last but it is awesome as fuck for the time being.... i am thoroughly enjoying myself.  Happy times for all.... i dont even know if i would want to be with other people right now.... i dotn even know if i could talk at this point.... i just want to be in my own zone and shit.  Just typing away, not giving a shit about spelling.  Just my fucking stream of consciousness and this music.  I want to dance, but whenever i move the visuals go away.... if i stay still and look at the screen, then slowly the visuals come back in..... but fuck it im dancing anyways.  Ok so is it going to be that much work to get strippers here.... dude i am a good ass typer, and i dont even realize how valuable of a skill that is... i am damn fucking good at this... my dad still hunts and pecks dude.... i think i can type faster than human speech... actually thats probably not true, but it is definitley closer to true if im typing like this without caing arout errors and shit, cuz thats a waste of time at this point.  Anyways, this fucking music is legit right now.  Lots of visualizations with this deep house music... i want the music louder, but then the neighbors will complain!  Definitely triping now.... im trippin dude but not like crazy.... i think i could still hold conversations and shit  but i want to just keep this going for a bit cuz the less i move, the more intense it is.  Keeping it going for right now, just staying in the same place and enjoying the fucking experience.  Sometimes i think im tripping balls, then other times im just like, maybe im just tired and im just liking this music.  Who fucking knos but whatever.  I hope this battery doesn't dies toon.  This music is sick, but i want the fucking beat to drop!   OK very good....it dropped.  Shite son.... fuckin a.  Good fucking shit... my eyes arec lomy eyees are closed typing rif

The first time I had it with chocolate milk (I know now dairy is a bad idea) and threw up during the comeup. Not to mention I had a hell of a hard time getting em all down the hatch. 

Second time I just had it with orange juice and there was no puking, however it was still a struggle to get em down (I actually had to give up on the last few it was that bad).

So I'm wondering if you people had any insight into what way I can best eat them, if possible without too much preparation (ie the tea I read a bit about).

I was wondering if there is anyone on the Reddits who has partaken over a long period of years or still does them in old age. (by old age I mean not a college kid experimenting with them). Any side effects/differences from doing them younger/ when you first started?

I am fine mentally after having taken shrooms, but my father(now deceased) had mental problems: schizophrenia, bipolar, and he never quite acted right. These all apparently started for him after taking many different drugs.

My grandmother has bipolar disorder( moms side of the family). She was malnutritioned as a child so I think that caused her issues.

I feel great when I take shrooms, the only lasting side effects being in the positive. I just always consider that its in my blood to be mentally vulnerable or unstable.

1376460651.0	1kc0b1	first shroom trip	churnice	9	3	2	"One Friday night in 2004, me and my friend Trevor were recording material for our acoustic comedy duo, Via Merchant. At sixteen, we were finding music-making increasingly satisfying, especially the more pot we smoked.  Trevor was a schoolmate of mine, a fellow victim of a private Christian brainwashing machine. But he was Hawaiian, and was uninterested in anything but good vibes and chill sounds. It was the local public school’s Spring Break, which shouldn’t have mattered to our private school asses, but it mattered. This Friday night promised insanity. Around 7:00 we decided to put the guitars down and call Marc. He laughingly asked us if we wanted shrooms. We gave him an enthusiastic affirmative and got a ride to where he was, the Agoura Mann.
Shrooms looked nothing like I thought they would. I envisioned moist, polka-dotted “Eat Me” shrooms from Alice and Wonderland. These were King Tut penises. Trevor and I had never done mushrooms, but we had made no secret of wanting to try them. Earlier that very night we had been on Erowid, gawking at psilocybin’s physical effects. We bought Marc’s shrooms.
From the Agoura Mann, we crossed an equestrian bridge over the 101 into Old Agoura. Trevor led the way to Ricky’s house, where we excitedly bragged about our soon-coming first mushroom trip. I asked if Ricky had anything we could eat the shrooms with; he recommended and provided Wonderbread, of all things. We swallowed our eighths. The taste was not of Wonderland.
Rickey had a really nice studio in his backyard where he’d jam with friends. About twenty minutes after we ate the mushies, maybe 8:30 PM, a few guys started having an improvised percussion jam. Trevor, however, presently okayed our group for a rich girl’s party, and the three guys drumming their hearts out were given the hint to wrap it up. Toward their jam’s end, I began to feel like I was controlling how my ears received the soundwaves, as though I had a wah-wah pedal in my ear. The djembes and congas began to sound like light sabers, steadily building up with an intensity of battle. Their performance reached its crescendo and ceased, not the least bit to my surprise. Vibes within me were growing. It was time for this chick’s party.
We went off to this chick’s house. I was now feeling the ‘body high’ of mushrooms, but couldn’t yet differentiate the mental effects from pot, as I kept taking pipe hits all night. My first clue was when I entered the girl’s kitchen and was met with what can only be described as a mob of bros. Mind you this was 2004, and the word ‘bro’ didn’t even mean that yet, but I left that kitchen quickly, perplexed by what seemed like a group of horny, off-duty BMX racers. 45 minutes had passed. I sauntered into the chick’s entry hall, where a long table displayed dozens of framed family photographs. A panoramic picture showed what was obviously a family reunion. I studied the many faces of literally all ages, imagining how they all related to one another. Expressions on faces began to change according to my presumptions. Old, sad faces melted downward. Young, mischievous faces became demonic trolls. I could have looked at that photograph for hours. My focus shifted to another picture, a painting of a lighthouse casting it’s beam out over a sandy beach at dusk. As I watched, the waves began to crash and recede onto the shoreline; the painting was alive. When the bro's stopped bragging in the background I could hear the soft thunder of the surf. I continued to look, the artist’s intended scene within the frame, a lighthouse on a beach, was fully animate and functioning. There became no difference between what it represented and what I observed. The mushrooms had definitely kicked in."	t5_2qszq	True

The first time I had them in a peanut butter sandwich at it was really hard to keep it in my mouth. The second time, which was about 5 mins ago, I just knocked the glass back of them ground up in lemon juice. It took all of my effort to not throw up.

I'm by no means a picky eater, and I love regular mushrooms, but I just can't bare the thought of having to go through this every time. It's worth it, sure, but it's still not fun at all.

My question is, how should I take them with minimal disgust? I can barely stand the smell of them, let alone taste. I've heard all sorts of things, tea, ice cream, chocolate.

So basically with my best friend we will try the shrooms as soon as I get them (in a few days). Well it actually won’t be shrooms but truffles (I don’t know if it’s the correct word in English, it’s this : http://french.shayanashop.com/Champignons_Magiques/Champignons_magiques/pd-2280-1024-pm14/Psilocybe_Tampanensis_Atlantis.aspx

I read everywhere that it’s basically the same thing. Anyway. I am wondering a few things : 

-	Can it be put in a freezer too eat for example a few months later (I’m asking this because  since the website didn’t deliver under 25euros of stuff I had to buy a bit more than intented (40grams of truffle) and we won’t take everything at once.. 

-	Since we live in Paris, we don’t have nature really close, and I don’t really see myself taking the subway or the bus to go to a park or something while tripping. I have a small and quiet balcony though, which is nice to chill out on. My friend also have a small garden at his home. Will one of these two things do the trick to enjoy the trip ? 

-	And a more general question but related, what do you advise us to do ? Just chill in garden/balcony ? Stay inside ? Watch a movie (I downloaded Microcosmos and Planet earth series) 

-	Finally, how awesome is a shroom trip ? I can’t wait.

I've never been one to measure my doses; over the course of this time I started small and increased my dosage with each subsequent trip. Eventually, this lead to my most recent trip where I not only experienced true ego death, but also experience what I can only describe as a connection to everything around me, like I could feel consciousness in everything (side note: hopefully anyone who has experienced the same can also see how a separation of language from thought amplifies this). 

Long buildup aside, what can I expect from a heavy dose of shrooms? With LSD, I become self-reflective, but I also become very intrigued by everything. On high doses, I easily lose the ability to triangulate my position in the world around me (i.e. I lose my sense of where I am). On San Pedro, the experience feels more meaningful and spiritual. Time is fucked way worse than it is on LSD, sometimes feeling as if it's randomly changing speeds. I've also done both at the same time; I had an incredibly revealing experience, but I don't recommend it unless you are very sure of yourself mentally.

i was experienced and in a positive state of mind with no short or long term baggage bringing me down. i was with my GF who staggered doses with me (ate them 2 hours after me) and a good friend who was not tripping. it was 1/8 and not the first time i had done that much. but this time was different.

it was the mushrooms. i felt poisoned soon after i took them. and then every single sound i heard echoed and boomed and completely engulfed me. i tried to explain to my GF that she couldn't speak because i couldn't take the explosions of stimuli. we went for a walk hoping that being outdoors would help. it didn't. 

an hour passes. and with it every emotion a human is capable of feeling erupted from me and landed at the feet of my friends. love, hate. gratefulness, horror. elation, melancholy. i found myself in one point crying, staring, babbling at a painting of a chair my GF had done.

eventually i felt dirty. i stripped naked and my GF and i both got in the shower. i couldn't get clean enough and i had the strongest urge to peel my skin off. it was crawling. i couldn't get naked enough. i wanted to peel the skin from my bones and find whatever (soul, light, energy?) was in me that wanted to free itself. i was lucky i wasn't alone.

then i came down. and wondered what the fuck happened. this was different from any trip i've ever had. whether mushrooms or other.

I've been planning a shroom trip of about 3.5 grams out alone in the woods, tomorrow during the day time. Ill be looking for some introspection and hopefully clarity for my life's path, the only catch is I am in the middle of trying to move on from a very intense relationship that did not end well, about three weeks ago. I'm handling the loss alright but the loneliness does take its toll.

Any advice on getting past this without it ruining my trip for me?

1369031619.0	1eoifi	Trip Report	nearlyheadlessnickk	11	4	7	"Nothing incredibly exciting, but still a moment for me:

A group of 10 friends drove up to Big Sur this weekend planning to take shrooms. It’s my fifth time shrooming, and with so many others around, I thought I’d only take 2.5.

We all ate them at the campsite in peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and went to explore the creek. After about half an hour some people had everything catch their eye, some people were feeling nauseous, and some were just anxious, including me.

I noticed I couldn’t quite get comfortable anywhere, and it was bothering me. I was also making sure to keep an eye on one friend in particular, because it was her first time and she was nervous about it. She told me she wasn’t feeling much and was anxious like me. I saw the green bushes make the trees behind them look black and white, and after a little bit more exploring, (shoes are off at this point, and most of us are just walking through the stream) I see her try to explain that she can see these three orbs and she was in one of them, when one person started laughing. He had the giggles.

So she gets up, seemingly upset, and walks down the stream. I slowly followed her, giving her space. As I’m trudging through the water, I come around and bend and see her, up ahead, sitting on a rock underneath the light. It was beautiful. She stood up and told me to go but I had to tell her how beautiful this was. She looked like a queen.

So I come over to her, aware that she’s upset, and she tells me about her orbs, and that there’s this presence holding them together, telling her everything’s going to be okay. And I assure her it is, and she starts to cry. They’re good tears though. It was like someone turned on all of the faucets inside of her and it was all flowing out of her into the stream. And we hugged. Also, I remember her pair of eyelids looked like individual bottom lids, and so it looked like she had four eyes.

She went on to tell me the presence was Ra, the Egyptian sun god, and that she was destined to be Mother Nature, and that these emotions were coming in waves.

And then people came. And I hated it, because they were intruding on our moment. And everything felt awkward because they could feel we had this bond now, and she tried explaining what happened to them, but they didn’t get it. They weren’t on that same wavelength. And she felt it too. She hasn’t moved from the rock since we hugged about two hours before.

Eventually everyone left but one person and we all talked about roller coasters and space babies, and he split a rock in half, and when a stranger came we left, and the trip was over. Just like that.

I didn’t have a life changing moment, and I didn’t see many visuals, and I didn’t even have a chance to think about the things in my own life, but now I have that moment. "	t5_2qszq	True

Being a first timer, I decided to take 0.7g dried Golden Teachers that I grew myself. My friends had about 1g each and most of them enjoyed it, but all were experienced trippers even at higher doses. I decided to take mine with my sober girlfriend who just sat and went along with whatever I did. It was nice. I have terrible stomach issues as it is, and read that ginger tea helps with the nausea. It....didn't really touch mine. I don't know if my mind was just making me think I was nauseas, or what, but I was fighting my nausea for about 2-3 hours after taking them on a peanut butter sammich. 

For the next time, should I try tea to ease the stomach issues? Or just take a bit of a higher dose like ~1g to to allow my body to stop fighting the trip. (i was shaking and felt jittery...like i needed to move around, but my body was so stoned i couldnt and all i wanted to do was fall asleep)

Okay, my cakes are almost done, they're all looking good. I'm growing a small personal usage amount of PC B+ strain. They are cased in BRF jars. They're almost fully colonized and will be using perlite as a hydrant in my fruiting chamber. 

Now, I have another separate growing project with penis envy strain, and WBS bags and will be using compost/soil from an online vendor for this fruiting chamber since they're in bags, not jars. 

I've never birthed cakes. Seeing dozens of videos, I see people birthing the cakes all the time and rolling them in vermiculite, then placing them in the fruiting chamber. So far so good, yet I don't have a very good understand of what vermiculite is, I'm guess it's just a means of fertilized or feeding the mycelium. If so, could I just roll the PF cakes in the compost I'll be using for my PE strain? Or does it have to be specifically vermiculite?

I have them in an upside down clear storage container with damp paper towel for moisture. Every thing was going well, I yeilded just over 10g dried then the heat wave hit and I live in an upstairs apartment with no A/C. The cake weren't doing much so I thought it was too hot. I moved everything to my bedroom which has a window A/C unit. Now the little shrooms that were on the cake look like they are stunted and dried. Humitiy dropped a lot when moved to the cooler room and the cooler room didn't initiate more pinning like I had hoped. I had gotten a spore print yet so I'm super bummed. I don't know if I should throw these cakes away and start again or if conditions are more ideal they will start fruiting again. Any advice would be helpful.	t5_2qszq	True
1341093958.0	vuvoa	A question about type of shrooms.	timBeans	8	2	7	So my girlfriend picked up shroom-ish thingy.  I don't know how to explain it but looks like a tiny white rock (from what I remember) and it's supposed to contain the substance in shrooms that makes you high (which I guess is psilocybin).  Apparently you are supposed to put it in your mouth and take it out when you feel high.  Does anyone have any experience with it?  Is it is what it's supposed to be (as in is it a rock of psilocybin)?  And is it just that, I just put it in my mouth and take out when I am high?  I am a first timer so I just wanted to inform myself.  Thanks!	t5_2qszq	True

What's up? I just had a quick question about a new precaution I had to take, and if it could've potentially affected the quality of my shrooms. 

Typically, I store my shrooms in a fridge, kept at cool temperatures, just as a precaution. Unfortunately, with my latest pickup, this was impossible, so I put them in my safe, in a bag within a plastic Rubbermaid container. It is important to note here that they were dried. They haven't been exposed to any oxygen (I haven't opened the bag) or light since I purchased them on Monday, but they've been kept at room temperature, or just below, since then.

Do you think the heat could have affected the quality of my mushrooms? Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but I want to make sure that their quality is the same.

Do you get similar munchies as weed? Are there any hallucinations? Does it matter if I smoke a joint first? Or after?

I'll be with 4 close family members, in a house. I'm thinking of watching ""What the bleep do we know"" or maybe ""Half Baked""

Any tips or advice are welcomed. 

UPDATE: I did shrooms last night, great experience. I was surprised how alert and aware I was, but was able to zone out and focus on something intensely. I didn't expect the body buzz I got, great feeling. I did end up staying inside mostly, it was pouring rain and freezing cold last night. I went out to the porch for a bit, which was nice. We became sensitive to light, had he tv on but dimmed with techno music playing. I'm not a fan of techno, but it was great! Bought some glow sticks from the dollar store and there them on my white shag rug which looked awesome, like tiny people dancing around the glow stick. I ate 2 grams only, but it seemed to do the job. Next time I will eat more. The stuff we got didn't make us laugh, but just really zoned us out in waves. Me and 2 others were doing it for our first time, one of us never did any drugs and she was fine, loving the experience. And I had no desire to take out my iPhone, eat or drink.

I've never had a bad trip with LSD because I know the lethal dose is waaaaaay more than I could ever imagine doing, but I guess shrooms just freak me out more because there are so many different varieties and it's hard to differentiate the safe ones from the dangerous ones (at least to the untrained eye).

I don't know if there is any long term damage from shrooms but ever since I took them I've been having flashbacks to the trip. 
While I was tripping, I kept seeing a strange ""face"" in different places. The ""face"" is sort of cartoonish with big round eyes and big red lips. The reason I put face in parenthesis is because I didn't always actually see the face but could picture it in my head when I looked at certain objects. Sorry if that doesn't make much sense but it's really hard to explain. 
Anyway, a couple of days after the trip I started seeing this face again. At first it wasn't a big deal but eventually I started seeing it about 10 times a day. As the week went on, the face started becoming more aggressive and creepy looking. Seeing the face was triggered by looking at certain objects or hearing different sounds.

All this is great, but my market is ready for pounds and I'm not producing enough. I've tried rye grain and failed miserably.

EDIT: I was asked for more detail. Here is the process I followed in detail.
1c rye grain (organic) per jar (6c total). Rinse VERY well, let sit for 24 hours. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Strain (till I set the rye on a paper towel and no water spots are left on towel). Fill jars 2/3 full with cleaned wet grain. Lid placed on with a hole in the middle, filled with a cotton ball for gas exchange (tight fit)  Covered with tin foil to avoid any water getting in. PC 15psi 90 mins. Let sit overnight. Inject varying ammounts of spore juice (I've got TONS, I make my own) from 2.5cc to 25cc (increasing in 5cc amounts each jar). As of now, I have had them almost a month in the inc chamber (80 degrees with air flushed every other day). The only 2 jars that look usable are the 2.5cc jar and the 5cc jar.

1371394869.0	1ggfqu	My first ever drug trip. [Story]	Hippowd0n	9	2	2	"Hey guys.
The only drugs I've ever done in my life is weed and shrooms. 
Only smoked a handful times, nothing major. 
Friday night me and my best friend went round a friends apartment to try some shrooms to celebrate finishing school. 
We got there, the owners of the apartment did their very best to make it the right environment for us (which was amazing) they put out candels, but calm music on quitely and just made it a very happy atmosphere. 

We proceeded to eat them. My friend (who does psychedelic drugs but never shrooms) ate 2 grams off the bat. I wanted to have a slow come up so I have 0.4 grams. Around 30mins later I wanted more, so I ate another 0.4. Another 30mins later I wanted even more so I ate 0.8grams. Now at this point I had no visuals (neither did my friend) we just felt really happy to be where we were. Comfortable as well. An hour past and I thought to have some more. But this time I ate a gram. 20mins after that gram I was sat in the corner of the sofa chilling out on my phone and I remember looking up and seeing the walls pulsate, zoom in and out then proceed to change colours. Obviously I knew it was the drug, so I just thought ""That looks cool, back to my phone"" So I went back on my phone to proceed to play mario. After 30 seconds of playing mario I was giggling too much to concentrate on the game, certain features of the game were emphasized then put into very high contrast along with yellow cross's that appeared around anything of significance on the game, e.g a mushroom enemy or brick. At this point I knew I was tripping balls, still really happy and enjoying myself. A few hours past and my friend still had no visuals just was really happy, at this point we had 1 1/2 grams left of our original 7 grams. It came to 6am and our hosts wanted to go to sleep, so we decided to split the last of what we had and eat them giving us a total of 7 grams eaten between us. As we did, we felt it was time to leave as my friends sister wanted to get picked up from a friends house after having a bad trip (everyone at the house was on the same drug and/or mdma). Once we got their my friend deiceded to stay there for 30mins as they were good friends. I did not like this part. I was sat on a hard floor listening to VERY loud drum and bass with people who I did not feel comfortable and jailbait snorting mdma off a CD case next to me. My friend was cool as he is used too this scene and I am not. It is obvious from where I am sitting why my friends sister had a bad trip and it looked like all she wanted to do was to go home and cry. As did I, yet I was not upset or wanting to cry. I just felt like I wanted to sleep but I wasn't sleepy. At this point I had no visuals as in my head being in this room killed it for me. Eventually my friends sister nagged him enough to go home as I followed. Once I got back to my friends house, he let me crash on his spare bed. The bed was small and quite uncomfortable but all I could feel was sadness. I do remember quite distinctively looking at the wall with my head pressed up against it and seeing all the particles move about and turn. All I wanted was to fall asleep and when I was sober enough to drive home, I would do so. About an hour passed (8am ish) and my friend woke me up saying that he wanted to go back to the house, I had told him I don't feel comfortable tripping in that house and I didn't want to leave. As we hadn't sleep properly I would advise just get another hours worth or so sleep before going anywhere. Of course he did not listen ""I just want to go out, you have to come with me. I want to lock the door and I can't do so with you here"". His offer to smoke weed with me was flattering but I declined as I would still need to drive home asap. About 20mins later he persuaded me to walk him to his friends house then I would drive home. Not the  best decision but I would do anything not to be in that house again. At this point my head was fine, I was thinking about really complicated things and it gew obivous that I was still high yet I had no visuals and I could think straight. I managed to get home safe and soundly after what felt like the longest drive in my like. In reality it was only 35mins but it felt like 3 days. Once I was at home, I got on my computer to play WoW. Proceeding to do so, I found myself with little to no effort to do anything whatsoever. I wanted to sleep, but I couldn't sleep. A few other friends spoke to me on skype but I was still too high to have a normal conversation. I was on a comedown, felt tired and depressed yet my head was still thinking of really intelligent things. E.g atoms, particles, math equations etc. After an hour it was clear I couldn't play wow. I managed to fall asleep in my bed until five pm. After awaking from my slumber I was no longer high, just on a comedown. I just surfed the internet for a few hours then fell asleep again at 9pm.

Now, today. I feel tired even though I have slept loads and still on a comedown sort of feeling yet nowhere near as intense as yesterday.

Overall, it was a very cool experience and I picked at good time to do it (No stress, no deadlines, no work, nothing). I would not do it again as I don't think I would need too as I discovered things about myself I never knew.

The only classic psychedelic I have tried to date is mushies. I have had them on only 3 occasions but have enjoyed them thoroughly each time. My first trip was and accidental ""heroic trip""; I ingested over an eighth of extremely potent mushrooms and had no idea what I was getting myself into. 

Since that first mushroom trip I have had memories ""burned"" into my mind. These memories are vivid, detailed replications of things I have seen while tripping.
Sometimes under the right setting I can get into the shrooms consciousness after smoking kush. Earlier today I was frightened by one of these experiences, however, usually these experiences are very enjoyable. 

The entire experience appears random and only lasts a minute or two, sometimes I get an afterglow effect lasting an hour. The strange thing is that this only occurs after not shrooming for a month and then becomes progressively more powerful and frequent the longer I wait to shroom again.

I was wondering if anyone had any incite into this anomaly?"	t5_2qszq	True

SteveTheHorse	8	3	6	"So I've only been involved in marijuana as far as drugs go, but I've had friends that have tried shrooms, so I'm somewhat familiar as far as they go. That said, I've been really interested in trying them for a ton of reasons, but seeing as you guys would know much better than I, I figure why not ask! 

I've read a lot of stories on here about these insane trips people have about feeling at one with other people, and one with nature and other sorts, and I've been really interested in these topics. I've always been interested, but I've been really troubled by these deeper kinds of thoughts recently, such as the perception of time, and how we're all connected, and trying to find out who I really am, albeit I am still rather young. I've just been really confused about all these, and I don't feel comfortable discussing them with any of my peers, as I feel like they wouldn't quite understand. Again, some of my friends have tried shrooms, but more for the trip and visual experience, rather than the journey that I am interested in taking.


I guess what I'm trying to ask is your guys opinion: would shrooms be a good choice to try and discover the answers to my questions? Such as self discovery, connection between us, and other similar topics.

Sorry for kind of taking a roundabout way around my point, but would highly appreciate any response! Thanks guys!"	t5_2qszq	True

They were grinded up and put in capsules.  And me being my eager self decided to take them right there, just took them. Like it was nothing. For a while, I felt like I got ripped off, didn't feel anything, then an hour later, I felt a body high,  lots of euphoria, felt so good. Then after class the visuals started happening, I looked at a white sign on the wall, and these blue waves appeared on it, it looked like it had a sea in it. I stared at it for a while, then I kept walking, I looked at the floor and the edges of the tiles on the floor were like breathing, and the walls were doing the same. And then I got to my next class, I wrote on my papers and I felt so strange, like my hand was writing without me controlling it. And one of my favorite parts was my teacher let us work on our homework during class and keep it until Monday, and let us listen to music, so of course I say there, looking around, seeing all these crazy visuals that were so cool. I put my headphones on and listened to some of my favorite songs, they made me feel indescribable. I could feel the music travel inside me. As I listened, the inside of my body felt like it was interacting with the music. It was awesome. The rest was pretty much the same. The whole trip ended like 5 hours later, I remember when it ended, I felt so bummed out, because I would try to look at something cool and expect it to do something, I couldn't tell what I would want it to do, as each time was different, but it wouldn't, and then school ended, and instead of going out to tell all of my friends on the bus, I sat there, looking back at one of the best times of my life. Everyone told me it'd be awesome, but I never expected it to be that awesome.	t5_2qszq	True

 Well yesterday a few really good friends of mine and I decided to try some shrooms I had purchased before (this would mark the 3rd or 4th time i've tried shrooms). After each consuming about 2.5 g- 3 g, we all began experiencing a very intense and very profound trip. I could compare the feeling to what reaching nirvana might be like as I was so profoundly happy with everything and being alive. The entire trip was amazing but now today I woke up feeling incredibly depressed again and i'm worried that my depression will gradually get worse again.

1352645685.0	130e7h	First time last night - strange/good but will not do again.	greentab	10	2	7	"Made some shroom tea with 2g last night. My bf was my trip sitter. I started feeling a little buzz pretty quickly within about 20 min. About an hour later the effects kinda hit me all at once. My hand started feeling tingly and like it wasn't a part of me. I started freaking out a little and it felt like I had a huge weight on my chest. Eventually I calmed down after listening to some music.

I went into the kitchen to get a snack and was eating slices of pickles. I looked down at the half eaten pickle I'm holding and I just start laughing hysterically to the point that I'm crying but then the crying turned into sadness and I started crying for real. I had to tell my bf to take the pickle from me cause I didn't want to let go of it. It was so strange how my emotions were all over the place. I just wanted to feel normal so I put Curb Your Enthusiasm on and we watched that for a while. 

At about the 2 hour mark was when the effects were peaking. I turned off the show and plugged my comp into the tv. I played songs over winamp with the visualizations tab open and that was extremely awesome. Watching the colors with the music was mesmerizing and made me feel really good inside. It was like I was on the verge of orgasm the whole time while watching it. 

I look down and see something on my shirt and freak out for a second but my bf says its just a fuzz so I pick it off and drop it to the floor while saying ""I don't even know what that is"". As soon as I said that I started crying again because it really bothered me that I didn't even know what that was and I just threw it away like it was nothing....without even trying to figure it out or looking at it first. I didn't give it a chance and just threw it away. 

I looked at my hand and it looked 3-D - like how you would see a 3-D drawing on paper. I flattened my hand parallel to the floor pointing away from me so when I looked at it, it looked like my hand wasn't there. Then I started blabbing on about how I couldn't see my hand but my bf could because he was sitting opposite of me and it's all about perspective. 

When I got up and walked around I felt really short like I was closer to the floor than usual. When I walked into a different room the ceiling seemed really close to my head. My hands started feeling really weak like I couldn't control them that well to grab things. I felt kinda like a crab using claws. If I started laughing really hard at something I would start to cry so I had to make sure I didn't laugh too hard.

After about 3 hours the effects started to fade and I was back to just the small buzz feeling. About an hour after that I was so tired that I had to go to bed. It was an interesting experience. The times I felt really good I could feel it throughout my whole body and the happiness was intense in every part of me. But I didn't like how a small thing like picking a fuzz off my shirt could send me into questioning myself and who I am. The emotional swings were unpredictable and came out of nowhere from unsuspecting sources triggering them. All in all I'm glad I did it to have the experience but I'd rather not do it again."	t5_2qszq	True

Oh, and the instructions tell me to harvest ALL the shrooms before preparing for the next flush. SO if I take the little small ones out, can I eat them too or should I just bin them?

1339248459.0	ut4ou	What's the smallest dose you tripped from? What happened?		7	1	17	"Hi everyone,

Yesterday, as an experiment, I took a single, small shroom before going out to meet with a larger group of friends. Dry weight was around 0.15g. 

Since this is well below the expected threshold dose, I didn't expect to feel any effects (I weigh around 80kg), and was very surprised to find that I did in fact start to trip. At first I mildly freaked out, since I met with non-psychedelic friends, but once I realised that the effects weren't getting stronger, and I felt comfortable on the plateau I started having a really good time.

I had some great conversations, and I felt I really got to know some of the people. I even had some extremely constructive work-related discussions. In addition, two of my friends who went along out of boredom had an extremely good time. It felt like the three of us were on an adventure, and I'm fairly certain that the fact I was mildly tripping  contributed to this.

So I'd like to hear your answers on a couple of questions I have regarding very low dose trips:

1. Did you ever have a memorable experience triggered by low dose shrooms? What was the dose? What happened?
2. Do you think that frequent low dose trips are a bad idea? I feel that mushies are very powerful substances, and so while the idea of taking them more frequently in extremely low doses seems somewhat appealing now (it never has after a high dose trip), I'm concerned I'll turn weird, or somehow do psychological harm to myself in ways that may only become apparent when its too late.
3. I have the impression that the fact I was mildly tripping transformed the dynamic of our group of 10 people in a positive way, turning a slightly forced meeting into a really enjoyable experience. Am I making shit up? Any similar experiences?

Anyways, we phoned and picked up $20 worth ($5/Shroom or Gram IDK) for the five of us. After I ate them I sat in the corner of the room for awhile (maybe 2 hours) and didn't experience anything. Also, after about 4 hours doing nothing we decided to go outside. All I wanted to do was lay down on the road.. I have no idea why.

I'm taking the shrooms with 2 other friends (not best friends, but i definitely feel comfortable with) and 1 very close friend to make sure i don't kill myself.

 I'm planning out the day to be a great day, with the idea of everything being calm and happy. I know what to do if a bad trips starts to come on, ill just try to go outside and explore, go with the trip and tell myself nothing bad will happen.

1376291435.0	1k6zzi	First Time Trip Report - Mind Blown	stoned_viking	6	1	5	"**Foreword**: I thought I would write about my first experience with magic mushrooms, it was definitely an eye opener.  It seems to have gotten quite long.. take from it what you will.

----

Four of us took 2g each, which ended up being 6 dry mushrooms of varying sizes.  They didn't taste bad - a bit like cardboard - but little bits get stuck in your teeth which wasn't fun.  They went down super easy with an M&amp;M or two, and there were no complaints by those who cut them up and put them with OJ either.  So far so good.

Sitting down for dinner 15 minutes later my legs were a bit wobbly and my stomach was starting to churn.  Having a cast-iron stomach that can handle anything I powered through, but one guy who usually doesn't eat much didn't think he could keep anything down so he missed out - which was unfortunate as he had cooked it all.  The food was amazing and I got probably half way through before the mushrooms hit me fully and I had to move and get some air - out of the corner seat that was beginning to feel claustraphobic.  

As others migrated into the lounge to join us we changed the music to a more chilled playlist and waited out the gutwrenching feeling which took probably another 30 minutes.  This was a strange period of time because you had to walk a fine line between talking, looking around and grounding yourself with cricket on TV as to not lose control and chuck your guts up.

----

**What followed this was the most exciting, entertaining and mind blowing experience of my life.**

It was a state of conciousness that is extremely hard to describe, but the word thrown around on here a fair bit is 'clarity' and that sums it up quite well.  My thoughts seemed to see through the bullshit and take all unnecessary factors out of the equation and see things for what they really were, right down to the base level.

On top of that I experienced **a bond with my partner and the other couple that is even harder to describe**.  We felt as if we were one conciousness, and were continuously finishing each others sentences and seemingly having entire conversations with each other without uttering a single word.  Later on in the night it felt like the two different couches were different worlds altogether, separated by millions of kilometers.

**Music played a massive part in dictating the mood of us all** - whether we were energetic or lethargic, in a thinking mood or just experiencing amazement at how high we were.  As soon as a song ended everyone would go dead quiet and wonder what happened, then think we were sober and it just wore off - then the next song would start up and the rollercoaster would being all over again.  We ended up putting on just the Silversun Pickups as it seemed like the perfect amount of calm, energy and inspiration.  Next time I'll take more care in building a better playlist to experience with different styles of music.

**It seemed as if we had the memory of a goldfish**, as every time we went on a mission to do something (move the music, change the song, get some socks, go to the toilet) it would take forever to just decide to do it and then even longer to accomplish it.  As soon as I walked into my room I questioned if it was the right room, then rummaging through my bag for socks I freaked out that it wasn't my bag.  I persevered through it and completed my quest, much to everyone's amusement.  It then took my girlfriend a good 45 minutes to put her socks on as we all kept getting distracted.

At the peak I was so high **it felt like my conciousness left my body and I didn't have full control of my limbs**.  Someone would pass me a joint or glass of wine (both of which we held all night but never really consumed) and my arms were brand new to me.  They just wouldn't work well, I was slow and clumsy as if using them for the first time.  Then I'd constantly forget I was holding a tissue or pack of burger rings - which took a good 30 minutes to eat a kiddy snack sized bag!

----

**Some other highlights I can expand on if people are interested**

* Chucking a piss released a huge sense of accomplishment
* Controlling any electronics was nearly impossible
* Photos of people would vibrate at me as if they were trying to talk or laugh
* Cricket constantly being a way of grounding ourself before things got out of control
* Changing rooms and being mesmerised by the kitchen floor tiles
* Having a revelation and near spriritual connection with of one the friends' dog

**I have a few questions also, if people have even read this far**

* No one hallucinated past some pulsating, I assume we just need to up the initial dosage?
* Someone heard that any more shrooms won't work again until 10 days later as our body has built up a tolerance - is this true?  When we were coming down we had 2 more to try get back up but it didn't seem to do anything.
* What kind of activities do you do?  We seemed to just sit on a couch and have the time of our life for 4-5 hours.

It was just the 5 of us in my friends basement with 300 glowsticks and some music. Everything was going well until we decided to go upstairs to get some snacks. One of the friends had been kind of reserved the whole time but was still interacting and joking with us. 

When we got upstairs in the kitchen they began to have a panic attack. So we quickly turned on the lights and tried to talk them down. They ended up going into some really dark shit and did not believe that what was happening was real and believed that we were some sort of demons there to torture them in hell. They even tried to bring in self harm which we did our best to make sure didn't happen We spent the next 3 hours comforting them back into the real world. Even after we thought that they would be alright they weren't 100% confident we weren't lying. 

Everything seems to be alright now but needless to say it ruined our experience, but I do know that I am glad that my buddy is ok.

1373309047.0	1hvpfn	Tripped balls this weekend	howdoesthisworkfuck	9	5	2	"*I had not anticipated this being such a long story, but it is what it is, tl;dr at the bottom*

Figured you guys would enjoy this story. Over the weekend me and my girl took the largest dose of shrooms either of us has ever dealt with before. Both of us enjoy our weed, but shrooms is fairly new to us. I wound up getting a hold of 1/4oz of some penis envy shrooms. As its well known, these are considerablly stronger than other shrooms, and boy do they mean it.

First some back story. We have tripped a total of 3 times prior to this. Our first attempt, the shrooms were bunk and did nothing. The second attempt, get got a hold of some cyans and took 1g each. That was our first true trip, and it was a truly magical experience. 

Next, we got a hold of the same type of shrooms and took 1.5 to go a little further, however they must have been old and lost some potency cause we barely got off the ground with them. Had a fun night, but didnt ""go anywhere"".

Finally, we have this weekend. We both had 4 day weekends thanks to some planned scheduling for days off so we really wanted to trip harder than we did the first one.

We put the 1/4oz into chocolates, and had 2 bars each with 1/8oz in each. Knowing how strong PE is, we figured half a bar each would be more than enough, almost 2gs in each half.

So we each took a half bar and waited about an hour and a half. You could start feeling them kick in and it was really nice, however I wasnt getting that strong trip that we had orignally sought after the first time.

So I made my first mistake of the night.. we both took the other halfs of the bars. We put on a movie to watch while they kicked in (wreck it ralph!) and started to chill out. 

About 20min later... holy fucking shit balls. The ""comeup"" anxiety was unreal and the potency was stronger than anything i've ever experienced in my life. It came on so sudden and strong that it freaking my girl out bad. For about 15min I was chasing her around the house trying to calm her down as it was scaring the hell out of her. 

In the meantime, im tripping so hard I can barely walk straight all while trying to comfort her while dealing with the comeup. She said it was so strong she kept blacking out and coming back in different parts of the house, in reality she wouldnt sit still and just kept walking around panicking. This sounds really terrible, but it only lasted about 15minutes.

15 min pass and I finally get her to settle down on the couch. I put on some music and we just sit there for a few. After about 3 minutes sitting there, we both start tripping, hard. It was magical and wonderful, and amazing all at the same time.

I noticed it before she did, as she was still calming down at this point, and I look over to her and say ""you realize we're tripping now right?"" Well that just set it off, we both look at each other and just start burst out laughing for a good 10-15min laughing fit. We then start laughing about how crazy we were not even 15min ago, and what the fuck just happened.

After we got past the come up, the trip was really special. It lasted a solid 4 hours, and in that time we laughed more than I have since I was a child. I loved my dog so much, and she loved being around us during it. We played with glow sticks, and strobe lights, listened to music, rolled around on the floor with blankets and pillows. It was like being a kid again.

It was truly a great experience, and especially a learning experience! Going forward I think we could handle such a large does and not freak out now knowing what to expect. The hardest part was letting the shrooms do what they do and not fighting it.

The way we described it, was it was like the shrooms were pulling ""you"" away from yourself. Your personality, your traits, everything that makes you ""you"" is dissolved when you trip that hard, and the great experience was being able to rebuild who you are from the ground up, without all the nonsense. It felt like such a mental flush afterwards.

*Clonazepam - decreases the utilization of 5-HT by neurons (reduce trip intensity)

*Lurasidone - antagonist of 5-HT2A (anti-hallucinogenic)

*Trazodone - antagonist of 5-HT2C (mood stabilizer)

*Propranolol - antagonist of 5-HT1A (physical effects)

Is it normal to feel things like that on shrooms? this may sound odd but for a few minutes i though i was really gonna die. after this trip i told myself I wasnt gonna take anymore for a good 2 months to just kinda relax my mind a bit. has anyone else felt this way before?	t5_2qszq	True

1371948328.0	1gvui4	First time trip report (5g)	xpansive	5	0	3	"My previous experience with psychedelics prior to this was just 200ug of LSD, which I really enjoyed but felt as though I could have gone with a much higher dose and handled it perfectly fine. I had 10g of mushrooms (penis envy apparently) and decided to split it evenly with a friend (B) who had the same previous experience as me. To summarize, it was an incredible experience and I’d like to try an even higher dose sometime.

The very first thing I noticed was about 15 minutes after ingestion, I looked out the front window and saw that there was a circular maze drawn in the grass. My buddy was in the living room playing megaman on the NES, and so I tried to walk over to him to ask if he was feeling it yet and managed to fall onto the floor in the process. After lifting myself up, I wobbled over to him as gravity pulled me towards the walls.

B was calmly writhing on the floor repeating the words “fitzgerald”, “petunia”, and “spruce grove”. I asked him what he was doing and he didn’t seem to hear me so I assumed the mushrooms hit him a little bit harder. When I asked him about this later, he told me he was trying to remember the name of a place so he started making a list of everything (because the place had to be on a list of everything) but those were the only 3 things he could think of.

I now decided to listen to some music ([Thriftworks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2TV_YXma2E) of course, I crave creepy stuff) and after much difficulty operating my phone because the buttons kept moving I managed to get it working. The closed eye visuals that followed were absolutely mind-blowing. There was a ball of rainbow tendrils, a figure in the woods made out glowing triangles with rounded sides and two intersecting 4 dimensional spike balls made of tiny donuts squished together, among countless indescribable others.

I stumbled into the kitchen and spied an apple even though I didn’t feel hungry. After taking a single bite I looked at it and realized I’d eaten the whole thing. The next hour is a blur, I can’t remember any specific events but when I think back on it I just see red and purple. Odd.

At this point B was functioning a bit more normally, and was continually pausing and unpausing megaman. I don’t think he had been doing this for the entire hour, but it’s hard to be sure. Apparently I then told him I was going to go wash my hands, then walked to the washroom and ran back backwards without even washing my hands. He thought this was hilarious so he started laughing and I tried to ask him what was so funny but it sounded like my voice was 4x too slow so I started laughing uncontrollably as well. 

Suddenly we were upstairs in my room discussing the problems with society but I found it hard to pay attention to the conversation because my voice was still in slow motion, there were rainbow tendrils coming out of a bright spot on the floor (from the window), and my skin felt like some kind of gel pack. 

I felt like I wanted to draw something now so I got out my notebook and started writing down numbers. I managed to reach 21 but then repeated it four times by accident and drew some simple fractals instead, which seemed like the natural thing to do. 
It was now hour 4 and we were starting to come down. I felt an incredible amount of energy but the visuals had mostly gone and according to B I was having a lot of trouble forming proper sentences. 

For a first time experience, I couldn’t have asked for anything more. It was definitely one of the best days of my life and I’d do it again in a heartbeat. Thanks for reading!

Shark_With_Lasers	7	2	7	"Let me start off by saying I am not new to mushrooms, I have tripped countless times back in college and I definitely know the drill in that regard. I'll be tripping again for the first time in a few years on the next few weeks along with my girlfriend who has never done any psychedelics.

My issue stems from this: I have only ever eaten wild picked mushies and never bought them so I have no clue how much I should buy/take. In the past I would always eat a few here and there and they were often fresh so the potency of just a few caps was much higher.

Theoretically, nothing that happens before the pressure cooking should matter if the pressure-cooking is meant to sterilize the jars and everything in them, right?

1363470712.0	1afi5q	Just wanted to share my (successful) first experience	twlife10	6	2	1	"Hey Reddit. I tripped for the first time 3 weeks ago. It was an extremely positive experience and I wanted to share it with you. 

My boyfriend and I went on a camping trip to a lovely little campsite by the beach. There are some incredible hiking trails there as well so we decided to split an eighth and go on a hiking adventure. My boyfriend has taken shrooms many times, as well as other psychedelics so I trust him and felt very safe.

We ate the mushrooms in our tent... it was about 11:15 in the morning and ventured out on our hike. It was a beautiful and clear day. The weather was just right--very warm with a wonderful breeze(we live in California so it's mostly always like this).

About thirty minutes into it, I started to feel somewhat nauseated but my boyfriend assured me that this was perfectly normal and that it would pass. I was starting to feel something. I looked out into the distant mountains and they appeared to be moving away from me. 

About 45 minutes into the hike is when the trip really began. My body started to feel a little tingly and I burst into the most incredible, uninhibited laughter I've ever experienced. I wasn't laughing because I found anything funny, but because I felt such an overwhelming joy. This laughter continued throughout most of the trip. 

It was the most beautiful hike I've been on. I was leading it, with my boyfriend behind me and everything felt right and everything made sense. I knew where to go, I knew where to stop. I felt so insanely connected to all the beautiful nature around me. I stopped and thanked the trees and plants and flowers for being there and for being so beautiful. I crawled and wanted to get dirty and immerse myself with everything around me. All the colors were vivid and everything had a life and a purpose; everything was breathing. Throughout the trip I kept saying, ""How did I not know about this before?"" I don't know how to explain it but everything felt so *right.*

Because of the elevation, (we hiked the whole thing, it was about 1500 feet) the air was incredibly clean and it was so easy to breathe. I felt as though we were floating. We were going at a really good pace, not too fast and slow enough to look at and appreciate everything around us. We didn't get tired *at all*, I didn't feel cold even though it was a lot colder the higher up we got and I get cold easily, I didn't feel hungry or tired. All I wanted to do was keep going.

 I had a lot of realizations. The biggest one was how wonderful it was to not know anything. My boyfriend and I were talking about this the whole time. I realized that not everything has to have an explanation, or a reason for being... I don't have to analyze every little thing. Some things just are and I accepted and embraced that. 

Coming down sucked because I didn't want this amazing feeling to go away. I felt young and strong and beautiful  and like I could do anything. I also felt a lot of love for myself. It was nice though, it went away in waves, just like it came on. It was very gradual.

We looked at the clock for the first time since that morning and it was 3:34. I was amazed because it felt like a whole day had gone by. 

We both had an incredibly positive experience thanks to each other that day. We felt each others' warm energies and love and that's what made it so positive. The setting too of course. It was a beautiful place, like nothing I'd ever seen before. We were so high up that we were walking through a cloud at one point. 

For anybody who wants to have a positive experience it's really important that you respect the drug. Don't overthink it. It has a lot to show you and a lot to teach you and if you let go and let it do its thing, you'll have a great time. 

That's another thing, letting go. It's the greatest feeling in the world to let go like that, especially when you're someone who overanalyzes and overthinks things in your life. Embrace it!

Make sure someone you trust is with you. You will really feel other peoples' energies when you're tripping and you don't want to be with someone negative who will bring you down or around a bunch of people you don't know. Trust me, it will freak you out. 

The last and probably the most important thing... **GO ON A FUCKING ADVENTURE.** Especially if you're worried about overthinking/having a bad trip. If you have something to do, especially if it's an awesome hike, you won't worry about anything else. At least in my experience. Being surrounded by nature will give you an immense appreciation for it and make you feel connected to it. 

I'm really grateful for the experience and I definitely learned a lot from it. If you do it under the right circumstances you will have a positive experience and learn a lot. Just remember to respect the drug. I look forward to tripping again and seeing what else lies in store for me. "	t5_2qszq	True

1358197176.0	16km79	New to Tripping!	SCOOBASTEVO	7	3	25	"So, here's the deal:

-I want to trip shrooms or acid

-I've done shrooms twice, not enough to start hallucinating though (1.7g each time... I'm about 150 lbs/ 70 kg)

I really want that spiritual experience that I can grow from. I'm not just trying to get stoopid and trip balls; I want to gain some insight. I'll be going off to college soon, and this is something I have been wanting to do before I go.

The set and setting are what I'm most concerned about. I don't know if I'll have the right mindset going into it, even though I've been excited to do it the last two times (though kind of let down since I didn't trip either time). Some people argue that you should basically just take whatever is coming to you, whether it's positive or negative, and look for truth within that.

I'd like to add that I've battled with depression (more like just general unhappiness, I don't like to be mentally diagnosed) and anxiety for the past few years. I'm over it for the most part. I learned a lot about myself, but there are still some things that trouble me.

Two weeks ago I used the PF tek method to set up four jars. As of now there is no growth at all. No contaminants thankfully, but no mycelium either. They are mason jars with 4 holes punched in the lid. There is nothing covering those holes so there definitely is air circulation. The temperature is around 74. The only thing I can think I did wrong was that I didn't wait long enough after sterilizing to inoculate, and the spores died from the heat. I waited long enough until the jars weren't hot, but were still a bit warm. Maybe the inside of the jars was significantly hotter than the outside?
If I did indeed kill the spores, i have a spare syringe. Considering my jars are apparently still sterile, could I just reinoculate them? Or do I have to start over?"	t5_2qszq	True

I was wondering if there was a FAQ for tips/pointers on people doing it for their first time.

My friends and I have only ever been under the influence of alcohol, or have tried weed.  So I don't want us to go into it thinking we're going to be fine and then having one or more people have a bad experience.

I understand that you can't really prepare us for what we'll feel, because I'm sure aside from the basics, it's different for everyone.  I just wasn't sure what we could/should do to prepare in terms of..maybe some of the following questions.

* How important is setting? Loud or Peaceful make a difference? (I assume peace and quite is preferred.)

* Should music be present or perhaps not?

* Should we all make sure to have eaten beforehand? Or does this matter?

* What things should we make sure aren't available to anyone who is having an intense trip (good or bad)?

These are just a few off the top of my head.  If anyone can provide any information, it's all helpful and new at this point.

1346660241.0	z9t4s	How similar are shrooms and salvia?	DRUGS_ARE_BAD_MAN	8	3	5	"I'm hoping to do shrooms sometime in the future. I have 4 or 5 friends who I've discussed the subject with that would be willing to do it with me. I have another friend who knows someone who always has shrooms and will happily get them for me at $20 an eighth. He's  tripped on these shrooms before and suggests that I dose an eighth per person, which according to the posts here is a lot. I think I'd like to start with a high dose so I'll do the full eighth and let my friends decide how much they want. In the past I've smoked a fair amount of weed, drank occasionally and smoked salvia twice. Salvia is the only psychedlic I've done before and I'd like to know how comparable my two salvia trips were to a shroom trip so I might know what to expect. Trip reports below. They ended up being longer than I had expected, I'm not sure if they are quality enough but if they are I figure I'll submit them to Erowid pending /r/shrooms opinion.



**Trip One**

I'll preface this by saying I'm a minor and live with my parents. I keep my drug use from them as best I can and as far as they know I've only ever drank alcohol, though I suspect that they are suspicious that I smoke weed occasionally. I really only do smoke occasionally, mostly with friends.


I made plans with two of my friends to sneak out and meet at a park near our school. It's about a 7 mile ride for me, but this wasn't an issue because I'm fairly athletic and my friends lived closer. The park borders an elementary school but it doesn't have a fence. On the school campus is a shed used to store PE equipment. We all met up and arrived at the shed around 12:45. We entered the shed and began smoking weed(Afghan orange if I remember correctly). At one point a bottle of gin came out and I took a swig or two. I'd say I had 1.5 OZs. At this point I wasn't out of my mind high, but fairly up there. I also felt a little tipsy, I have a fairly low tolerance. It was then that my friend brought out the salvia. He packed a nice big bowl and let me take the first hit. I held for awhile and exhaled, took a second hit but didn't hold it nearly as long. After about a minute the effects hit me. My thought process was seriously altered. The first thing I noticed was that my arms extended past my shoulders and behind my head, in my mind my arm was far larger than usual but the part that was out of my field of vision and was as large as a pyramid. I knew this was just the salvia, but it was an interesting sensation to wiggle my massive arms around knowing that they didn't really have the dimensions I was registing in my mind. After getting acquainted with my arms I looked down and saw my shoes and the way they were positioned came to somehow represent the location of my neighborhood grocery store and the rest of he neighborhood. It felt very deeply meaningful at the time and I couldn't tear my eyes off my feet for awhile. When I finally did look up my friends were laughing at me for wiggling my arms around and being amazed at them. Behind them I noticed the wood framing inside the shed, [similar to this minus the window.](http://www.shedsforlessdirect.com/storage-sheds-images/Best-Barns-Elm-Shed-inside.jpg) Each panel of the shed seemed to represent a different scene that I couldn't enter. I focused on one of them and was able to see leaves on a tree and imagined it being a peaceful place. I tried to focus on another but saw something similar. At this point the trip began to fade. We stayed in the shed talking longer, I occasionally asked to smoke more salvia because I had enjoyed it but my friend didn't acknowledge my requests. We finally left at 2:00 or 3:00 AM. For me the trip lasted about 10 minutes. This could be attributed to the weed but on the bike ride home I kept seing seeing faces from afar that would later turn out to be holes in bushes, car mirrors or stop signs when I got closer.

**Trip Two**

My second trip was with one of my friends from the first trip. It was about 1:00PM on a sunny sunday afternoon. We went up to the top level of a parking garage where there weren't any cars and found 3 plastic crates and sat down on them. We smoked a little weed, I didn't smoke much because I wanted a pure salvia trip, but my friend insisted. Only slightly high my friend loaded a bowl for me. I took one hit and handed him the pipe. The effects set in quickly and before I knew it my vision had zoomed in on my friends face and his fair. My vision became a sort of fractal where triangles containing his face and hair made up my entire field of vision. The triangles were separated by a black line bordered by white, similar to meme text. I began to wonder how long this would last. I stated to worry it would last forever and I wouldn't be able to handle the responsibilities of day to day life if I did. Then I decided it wouldn't matter if it lasted forever because I would enjoy perpetually tripping through life no matter what. Eventually my thoughts shifted and I came to realize that the black lines separating the triangles were shaped like a person, which I realized was me. I had become the black lines that separated the triangles. On a level I knew I wasn't, but it seemed so profound at the time, that I could envision myself within my field of vision and I was no longer really what I had been before. It was at that point that I realized that it would eventually wear off, I would be able to handle life and I wasn't really a series of black lines. With that realization I decided I wanted to get up and walk around before it did end. This proved difficult because my body felt connected to the crate I was sitting on, and uprooting myself was no easy task. I walked across the parking lot until I came to the edge. I looked down, but wasn't particularly interested with what I saw. I decided that since I was still tripping pretty hard it would be better to stay away from the edge lest I decide I want to jump off or somehow accidentally fall over the railing. I then walked around the parking lot until I came down, which was rather uninteresting since it was completely empty. We then took the stairs to the ground and sat at a table watching Off The Air, which is awesome after tripping.

Sorry for making this post almost solely about salvia. **I'd like to know how my experiences with salvia compare to shrooms.** I'd like to hear from people who have done both, though if you haven't that's fine, but **I would like to know if your speaking from experience or just what you assume salvia to be like** from reading about it. Also, anything you think a first time tripper should know would be great. Any response is welcomed."	t5_2qszq	True

I was convinced I was going insane; I started to have fantasies of how reality works and really really started to believe them, but luckily I was sane enough to tell myself to hold off on acting on these beliefs and review them when I'm sober, something that was really hard to do with strange foreign voices whispering to me.
My friend staid in a closed room, thinking, tripping and crying, and he told me he thought he was going insane too. He didn't discuss what he felt or saw in detail, but it must have been intense, I've never seen that guy cry.

We both feel just fine now, but what I'm really concerned about is the reaction we had afterwards. Both of us got swollen limbs especially our hands. It looks like we had a serious allergic reaction... I also felt a lot more nauseous than I usually do on shrooms, and my whole body ached after the trip.

My question is, have any of you ever had this reaction to shrooms? If so, any idea what causes it? Foreign fungus, old shrooms, lemon tek?

Any help would be much appreciated! I'd like to avoid this situation next time. Peace :)"	t5_2qszq	True

A little patterning with things like the stipple on the ceiling, a little distortion at times... not much at all. And holy shit did I get sick. I was fine at first, but after 3 or 4 hours the nausea hit me, and I felt unbelievably sick for 2 maybe 2.5 hours. I also felt like I got a fever and was sweating buckets.

All things said and done, I've tripped way *way* harder off a toke of the bowl than the mush, and without my guts turning into a damn nightmare. 

I thought mushrooms were supposed to be trippy as hell? People draw pictures and stuff during/after sessions and I thought I'd be on another planet... but I never left the launchpad. On pot I might watch some trippy movies and listen to music... Music during the trip was ok... not as good as on pot... and a movie to facilitate tripping was not very trippy at all... on pot it would fuck me up.

I'll try once more, but I can get a minor case of the giggles elsewhere without the puke-filled-horror-show.

So for round 2, if I lemon-teked them, how much should I do? 2g? or go 2.5? Maybe the problem is I need to go balls to the walls and should crank up the dose?

Or maybe I should make tea?

1374594669.0	1iw1y7	What happened during my trip?	mrthrowaway92	5	1	11	"Hello r/shrooms. Throwaway here because too many people know my reddit account. Anyways, down to business:

On Sunday I tripped with some friends. I'm a decently experienced shroomer, probably in the teens as far as how many trips I've had. I took 3g this time, a bit of a bump up from my usual 2.5-2.75. The trip was amazing throughout, until something weird happened much later in the trip. We were definitely on the come-down, we took the shrooms around 5 and this happens probably sometime around 10-11. We had smoked a very generous about of bud, so we were still vibing. 

We were chilling, listening to some vinyls, Abbey Road side A was the one that was on in particular. All of a sudden, during the song ""She's so Heavy"", my mind starts to wander off a bit. I don't know why, but I started thinking of that scene in super troopers when the guy has to eat all of the shrooms. For some reason this made me imagine a situation in which a cop made me eat a lot of shrooms. Like a life-changing amount. Then, only what I can describe as a panic attack happens. One second I'm still imagining having to eat all of those shrooms, the next thing I know I'm laying on the ground and my friends are freaking out. I felt like I was tripping hardcore, and according to my friends my eyes had gone into the back of my head and I just fell to the ground. They turned the vinyl off, which helped me think straighter, but i was in a cold sweat and I was very pale. After eating some and drinking water I felt better within 20 minutes or so.

Basically, I'm just trying to figure out if I should be worried. I don't think I should be, but I'm trying to be careful. Can you, for lack of a better term, ""re-trip"" on shrooms in that sort of manner? It honestly scared the shit out of my friends, they were about to call an ambulance, and I can't say that I wasn't scared out of my mind during it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

But the trip comes a lot quicker, i could feel it in 10 minutes, rather than chewing them and waiting 30 minutes to an hour. But its hard to drink all the tea and it gets gross. Is there any other ways to make something to eat, or drink that has a good taste? im not a tea fan, and i dont know how else to extract the psilocybin.

This summer my friend and I were able to get a few stems. It was a good experience but it was clearly far from a full trip, and was only half as good as it was because we smoked.

Now, I recently came into possession of an 1/8th so my and my roommate decided we would split it. He had never done it before, and I pretty much never had so 1.75g seemed like a fine starting place. We unfortunately couldn't do it the same day though, so I did it first, then he the next day.

Now for my trip, I smoked a little about 30min before hand and the proceeded to eat them. I had put them in a pb&amp;j and it took me almost 30min to eat them. Shortly before finishing the sandwich I began to feel incredibly calm and relaxed. After about an hour and half after finishing this feeling was growing stronger and stronger, but that was all I really felt. We had been outside up to this point so after going on a short walk we went inside and I listened to music, stared at the Itunes visualizer and just hung out. I was not seeing anything though, my trip was coming mostly from my head.

Part 2, after about 2 1/2 hours I decided to smoke again. At this point the mushrooms clearly hit me, but in a way unlike I was expecting. To make this as short as possible, ill just give a brief synopsis. 

- The itunes visualizer was now incredible, I probably spent over an hour staring at it while listening to music.(I suggest the classic visualizer)
- I was thinking like crazy. My mind was racing and working at 1000 times faster then it usually would have.
- I took a walk, and just hung around the rest of the night.
- I had 0 visuals.

That is a basic run down of what happened. Now, my question is why did I not have any hallucinations. It seemed like my whole trip was concentrated in my head. It basically felt like the most incredible head high I have ever had.
My roommate took them the very next day and within half an hour he was seeing colours on the ceiling and was seeing things throughout the day. 

Now for my questions.
Do I simply have a higher tolerance for shrooms then he did and didn't take enough to experience visuals. Or, no matter how much I take, will I always experience a similar if more intense trip then the one I did.

TL;DR Thanks for reading(if you did), and basically the questions are just at the end so you don't have to read the whole thing."	t5_2qszq	True

I've been exploring this sub all morning because my friend has asked me if I would like to try shrooms today. She has taken them a few times in the past and says they are a blast. I'm very open to exploring the power of the mind and experiencing most things once, but I have one concern. 

Like I hope everyone would do before taking any kind of drug, I decided to do my research. The main thing that is bothering me is that I have read that if you have any family history of mental illness (depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, etc.) it may be more dangerous to take shrooms. 

Well, my dad has told me about taking shrooms back in the day and he loved it. It was his favorite drug. And he is a very sane and great person at 60. My mom, however, has a lot of mental issues. She is a paranoid schizophrenic, manic depressant, and has social anxiety.

1366552569.0	1css2g	First time tripping. My experience.	oBsNoble	9	5	1	"
For 4/20, I decided to trip for my first time. On Friday I purchased a 4.7g shroom, and patiently waited until the following day. I had asked my friend to babysit me thinking it was essential given the dosage and it was my first time, but he couldn't make it. I ate it anyway, at exactly noon. Nothing happened for the first 30-45 minutes, then the yawns started.
 
I started feeling slightly euphoric, so I grabbed an iPod and my phone and set off for an adventure around the lake behind my house. The scenery was absolutely breathtaking. The skies were a beautiful, soft shade of blue, the lake water was gentle and clear, and the sun shone bright and majestic-like as it heated my skin in the most sensational way possible.

 I began my stroll around my lake, occasionally stopping to rest and truly appreciate nature whilst getting lost in my thoughts. The music set different kinds of moods varying on the genre of music I was listening to. However, it intensely amplified the trip. It was simply the most euphoric and spiritual I have ever felt in my life.

 My thoughts focused mainly on acceptance of life and all it's endeavors, and the humbling fact that those at the top of their passion, will eventually have to step down and allow for the next generation to reign. I learned so much about myself and my place in the universe, things I wish I could put into words and drawings, but I can't. It was amazing.

TL;DR: First time tripping, took 4.7gs, had an absolutely overwhelmingly positive time."	t5_2qszq	True
1366082203.0	1cfs25	Drying mushrooms?	mushies1	5	0	4	So I just had my first harvest, a large amount of mushrooms grew. Now here's the issue of drying, I'm using a desiccant, silica gel, to totally dry them out. Is it an option to simply place the mushrooms in the gel to let them dry? Would this be dangerous for consumption later? What's the best, cheapest method I can use for drying mushrooms if this doesn't seem like a wise decision? Thanks for any help, I appreciate it. 	t5_2qszq	True

1363010923.0	1a2ylc	Will I Trip	_bubbers_	4	1	5	I take 50mg of zoloft (Sertraline) nightly. I have been doing some research and trying to find answers on wether or not I will be able to trip. It seems a lot of people are saying that the trip will be greatly reduced and I wont experience a full trip or get visuals while on zoloft due to the fact that they inhibit seratonin receptors which will reduce the effect of Shrooms. I take zoloft for anxiety. Im wondering if I should eat the same dosage as my friends as this will be my first time tripping and I do not want it to be too intense, or if I should eat double to try and get the trip. Part of me thinks I should just decide not to trip until I can ween off my medication (not planning on that anytime soon) but im worried that my friends will have this amazing experience and become closer while I become alienated and less close with them as I am missing out on an incredible experience. 	t5_2qszq	True
1362895707.0	1a0gt5	Holding them under your tongue?	gregavelli88	7	1	14	I tried shrooms for the first time this past week, and it was awesome! Anyway, my friend told me to chew them up and hold them under my tongue for 5 to 10 minutes before swallowing for more potency. Something about you you get more psilocybin that your stomach acid would normally just kill. Any legitimacy to this? I have my doubts.	t5_2qszq	True
