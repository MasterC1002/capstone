1366598760.0	1cu91v	Am I the only one getting fed up with pay to win and microtransaction based games on mobile devices?	paradigmx	267	80	97	"It happens on both free and paid apps, it seems like almost every time I find a game that's half decent, it falls apart the second I realize that there is only so far you can get without shilling out a couple bucks every few days just to advance the game. Mobile developers just seem to be eyeing that lucrative ball of microtransactions instead of focusing on creating an enjoyable game.

I know this is generalizing, and I know there are a lot of really good games on the market, but they seem to be getting fewer and further between. This is especially predominant in the city builder/management genre. 

I for one would rather see a game released with a $10-$20 price tag, with a Demo that has no microtransactions and solid balanced gameplay throughout than nickel and dime my way up to spending $10-$20 or more on broken mechanics designed to rip you off.

I have spent good money on the Android store on games that are more expensive that provide good playability, Final Fantasy Dimensions and GTA: Vice city for example. I have also spent money on some microtransactions for games that I feel have balanced themselves well enough to not be pay to win. To all the developers reading this, we need quality games, stop feeding us crap, eventually people are just going to stop supporting you.

Edit:
I should clarify, I'm not against Micro-transactions and IAP as a whole, I'm against using them as a barrier to accessing content in a game, especially a game that you have already paid for. Real Racing 3 is a game that, in my opinion, does IAP very well. Anything you can do in the game can be done without payment, you can access all the tracks and I think all the cars, and while you can use IAP to speed up repair times or unlock things earlier, you don't need to. Shipwrecked, to a smaller degree is another game that does IAP decently, and everything is technically unlockable without paying for anything. It may take some time to save up the required currency and swords and gold are difficult to obtain, but it doesn't stop your progression. I am even ok with the idea of releasing, essentially, DLC packs for a game that you already paid for so long as it doesn't create a barrier to playing the stock game. "	t5_2s2ul	True

Once I saw this screen, I assumed this version was the same as the others so I didn't get a refund within 15 minutes.  

After beating sealed mode campaign I realized it wasn't included in the android version so I emailed support to get a refund.  I couldn't, so I asked for a steam key so I could play online (that's what I would have used the refund for anyway).  But they wouldn't do either option so just a word of warning to anyone expecting online multiplayer!

1367807614.0	1drofr	Yo dawg, I heard you like emulators...	appu1232	150	44	20	"[So I emulated a ti-89 which emulated a gameboy which ran Pokemon Red.](http://imgur.com/nPDeUJg)

How I did it:

1. Downloaded [Graph 89](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Bisha.TI89EmuDonation&amp;hl=en) (paid version) onto my phone. I have a Note II.
2. Downloaded TI-89 Titanium OS from the ti website.
3. Downloaded the gameboy emulator [gb68k](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/369/36950.html) for the TI-89.
4. Put the ti-89 titanium OS on my SD Card.
4. Loaded up the OS on Graph 89.
5. Installed gb68k on the ti-89 by putting it on the SD Card and using the ""Send File"" feature in Graph 89.
6. Converted Pokemon Red into files that gb68k could read by using a converter that came with the gb68k download.
7. Put the Pokemon files on my SD Card and loaded it up on Graph 89. (There were 18 files but I had to do it three at a time because there is very littler RAM in the TI-89 so you have to archive it).
8. I loaded up Pokemon by opening gb68k and I adjusted the ""configuration settings"" in Graph 89 so that grayscale was on and cpu was set to a speed so that the game was playable (200% for me).

That's it! I had fun showing it off to my friends. The speed is decent. There is a bit of lag sometimes but it's definitely playable. Of course, I wouldn't recommend doing this just for playing it. It's fun to think about an emulator inside an emulator but it's definitely not practical."	t5_2s2ul	True

It runs at full framerate, with no noticable lag, on a Galaxy S2 without overclocking. It has everything you ask for, including autosave features, button mapping, and every possible screen setup you will ever need, which includes screens above each other in portrait mode, screens beside each other (touch screen on the side you prefer), and just one screen, with easy switching between them when needed. It also has quick access to switching between virtual keys+touch, only keys and only touch. So far I've tried the first few levels of NSMB and Scribblenauts, and the intro of TLoZ: PH, and everything runs really smoothly. The app crashes every now and then either on startup or upon loading a game, but once the game is started, I've not experienced a single crash. It's a bit pricey at 8$, but well worth it.

So, starscale is a turn based city builder.  Well, it's a turn based colony builder.  Because that's what you do.  You build colonies.  Congratulations on the promotion by the way, your new title requires you to establish mining and research operations in a solar system far far away.

So, you build colonies:

Drop a command center, and then call in other pods to establish a colony.

But be careful!  Space is dangerous.  Disasters are rolled every turn, and you have to think fast to minimize the damage.  Still, the harsh realities of cold space will catch up with your colonists eventually, so prepare for the inevitable and it's arrival will be enjoyable.

**OK, so it's not even an alpha release yet**

The core features are *almost* finished.  I think I got three or so tasks left before it's even fully playable.  All the systems are in place *except* your buildings cannot be destroyed, so you cannot loose, so the game isn't actually fun yet.

**Here's what you can do**

 * Traverse the solar system by flinging right and left.  On the webdemo, click and drag to simulate a finger touch.

 * Visit a planet by tapping on it, or return to the solar system by pressing the leave button

 * While visiting a planet, tap on the Colony info to create a new colony on the surface

 * Tap `Base`, place it, and click the check, and then hit next turn.

 * build other buildings, hitting the next turn button regularly

 * fires and floods can occur in a building every turn

 * perform the 'open airlock' action to put out a fire or drain a flood.

**so what's next?**

 * health and colonies getting destroyed.  This will require functionality for restarting a colony.
 * per building upgrade slots, to automatically negate effects of some disasters.
 * resource system, involving different minerals on different planets allowing for unique upgrades
 * a tech tree to spend science on, which will give a bonus to every colony on every planet
 * more actions per building and hooking up the remaining ones
 * many many more disasters and unique patterns of actions required to negate them (over multiple turns).
 * and much more!


So check it out please, and let me know what you think!  Just a reminder this is all a work in progress.  Thanks!

In Temple Run, if you trip, it slows you way back down with virtually no penalty (as long as you don't trip again). This can be used to get really high scoring runs when the speed gets too intense.

In Subway Surfers, the egg-collecting thing is drawing to a close. If your multiplier is maxed out, the first power-up comes at around 8000 points, and the first egg at about 15000 (it comes closer to 26000 if the powerup is a 2x). So I've been farming the first egg drop for a long time trying to get 100. The second egg doesn't drop for much longer, so it's much easier just to die at 20-whatever-thousand points and go again.

A little about the boot mechanics - If you have the jump boots (Subway Surfers), if you are above anything, including easter eggs or powerups, you will pick it up. Even if the item is on the ground level. If you're in a high jump and the boots wear off, you will stop picking up coins/items when the boots wear off, even mid-air. It took some trial and error to figure this out, and there aren't a ton of situations it effects.

I know many of you guys probably don't play these games or care, but I thought I'd throw it out there."	t5_2s2ul	True

I set up a dev blog, to keep everyone updated in the development process: [dev blog](http://g0ldent0ydev.blogspot.de/)


More information about the project can be found there, as well as a small collection of pictures, to give a first impression, what the game should be like.

I know IOs usually gets the really good games first, and then Android is lucky if we get a port of the good stuff, but what do you guys think are the best gems in the playstore?

I'm not looking for the simple time-waster stuff like Angry Birds or Jetpack Joyride. Those games are fine, but I'm looking for true immersive games, stuff that is actually going to complete with a console/handheld title. "	t5_2s2ul	True

It doesn't actually unlock the skills so that you can use them in the regular mode. They go away after the end of the game.

What a fucking waste.

EDIT: Just to clarify, it's a cool mode. It just doesn't do what I thought it did. I thought it would save you from having to buy the IAPs or play for years in order to save up enough punchos to unlock the higher tier skills. I thought that when you punched a skill in Spartan Mode it would unlock in Quest mode. Turns out I was wrong.

Don't let this put you off the game. The game is fun for a good long time before you realise that there's no real ramp up in the amount of in game currency that you get, so getting the higher tier unlocks is basically impossible. Sadly it's a potentially great game that was ruined by IAPs. Now that I've discovered what I mentioned above I'll probably stop playing it, but for $.99 it was a great game while it lasted. I just wish it was $5 and had no IAPs."	t5_2s2ul	True

We all know Angry Birds.  We've probably all sat down and had a play of Temple Runner.  Minecraft is practically an institution.  

I want to hear about the brilliant games nobody is really talking about.  They deserve our attention because Android, as a platform for gaming, has been relegated to the horrid pit we refer to as 'Casual'.  

Casual games are easy.  They're monetized to death.  Most of them are as artistic as a finger-painting and deep as puddle.  I don't care about casual games.  I want to hear about *actual* games; games you'd want to dedicate time and attention to rather than games you'd play when you're having a poo.  

Here is a couple I've found.  Add to it!  

The Ur-Quan Masters: A classic space exploration game.  The controls take a bit to work out but once you have, the game is fantastic fun.  

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sourceforge.sc2

UFO Defense: This is an Xcom clone but a decent one.  The largest number of downvotes come from some functionality issues but for me, the game worked and it *feels* very Xcom which is important.

1359211654.0	17bdrk	New website for Android games, would love your thoughts!	Motoko-Kusanagi	67	19	73	"Hey everyone,

I've personally felt there are a few problems when it comes to Android gaming, these are:

 - Knowing which games are actually fun / worth my time
 - Finding information about in-app purchases, in game advertising and hidden catches
 - The controls. As in, would it be fiddly to play.

So I spent the last week creating a website that aims to solves those issues.

**However**

There are a few problems:

 - I have no idea if other people share these issues
 - I have no idea if my site would be the solution
 - I have no idea if my site actually provides the solution

So if you have some time, would you mind checking it out? It's called [Top Android Games](http://www.topandroidgames.info/)

**Few points about the site**

I really can't afford to spend months creating the 'perfect vision' of a website if there isn't any actual need for it. So the site is quite basic, including the content.

It has most of the important things, however is missing some key pieces of content, such as images of in-app purchases, images of in-game advertising (you'll see the relevant section).

The left side bar that says ""top gaming deals"" will feature gaming deals from around various networks (steam etc). This will also feature games from Amazon which would be affiliate links. An example of one possible way I plan to monetise the site. 

Also there are sections that can easily be added / removed. For example under 'Cytus', there is a tab for 'Official Trailer'. Would people find the actual trailer useful?

**What I need from you**

Would you actually use it?

Any feedback would be awesome! It would be even more awesome if you could give any opinion on things you would want to see from the site. For example I still need to add in a section about which devices the game is compatible with.

I'll be around until about 7PM (UK Time) but will respond to any messages I miss tomorrow.

Thanks guys.

**EDIT** Forgot to add, obviously like I said, this is the basic level. There is still a lot more improvement that can be done, including a mobile version of the site etc. Just have to make sure I actually have a real solution to a real problem."	t5_2s2ul	True

My name is Dani and I'm an indie game developer and computer science student.

For the past 6 months I have been working on a mobile puzzle game called Roll With It! I was hoping for the game to make a bit of revenue for me to be able to afford my next year's tuition.

After a lot of work in order to make the most out of the game, it was released last week. Unfortunately it didn't got much attention and thus didn't match up to my expectations.

I'm afraid that if it keeps not selling I will have to suspend my academic education and find a job since I won't be able to sustain it. And this is where I need your help - spread the word about my game! Try out the demo, buy it if you like, and most importantly, tell the world about it.

I love being a game developer and I believe this can be a great jump start into the gaming industry. If you support indie games, and you want to see more of them coming, it should be in your interests to support indie developers.

I already have big plans for my next game and I'm sure all of you will love it, but to make it real, I just can't fail right now.

Please help me make this game a success... It doesn't have to be a big one. Just enough to keep me going.

A good friend of mine has been producing a mobile MMO for the last year or so, with it just going live on kickstarter I'm trying to do my bit to help by spreading the word!

Tides of Glory features twitch based real time combat, an immersive world that changes based on player actions, and a free to play model with no pay to win aspects. Check out the video and info on the kickstarter page for a far better idea of what the game is about.

Here are a few pics of him dressed as a pirate: http://imgur.com/a/XlXyG

Please check out the kickstarter project here: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1407831032/tides-of-glory

And come join us for the livestream on twitch: http://www.twitch.tv/judgeuk

If you have any question aimed at Jules (the developer) you can post them over in /r/tidesofglory or simply ask them in the twitch chat, or even post them here and I will forward them to him.

So far, the games I have and am enjoying thoroughly are:

* Pixel Dungeon
* Plague Inc
* Flow
* Townsmen
* Brain N-Back (not really a game, but great fun none-the-less)

I'm looking for (and will be saddened when nothing turns up) a game similar to [Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/), [Dwarf Fortress](http://bay12games.com/dwarves/) or [Prison Architect](http://www.introversion.co.uk/prisonarchitect/).

These games all have a similar, painful, vibe to them.. For masochistic gamers.. I'm not sure how else to describe it.

I want extremely meticulous planning, building, failing, planning, rebuilding, failing .. Things like that. Graphics are secondary, but they can't be so bad as OpenTTD.. That just looked awful. I mean, Dwarf Fortress doesn't *try* to look good, which is why it's ok to me.

I just thought I'd share my experience playing GBA games, with big hands, on my GS3. I didn't try games that I thought would be super difficult, so no Mario, no WarioWare, et cetera. Here's a few good, playable compromises:


GOLDEN SUN: Duh. This works for any turn-based RPG. Super easy to control.


ADVANCE WARS: Another duh, but I can't say enough about how good this game looks on a big phone. I always thought those tiles and sprites were a little bit hard to sensibly navigate on the original GBAs' small, un-backlit screens, and on my GS3 everything just pops.


CASTLEVANIA - ARIA OF SORROW: This is perhaps not an obvious choice, but I always thought the Castlevania series was more about planning, strategy, and careful timing than it was about really exact controls. The HP system is forgiving, too: In Mario, you mess up, you die, whereas in Castlevania, you lose, like, what, 7 HP. Side note: Screenshot-saving within an emulator is a goddamn life saver.

MARIO GOLF: I didn't pick this one up when I had a GBA, and for those of you who didn't, YOU ARE MISSING OUT. Mario Golf has become almost a therapeutic exercise for me. On a crowded bus next to an unwashed gross person? No you're not-- you're hitting the links in a tropical paradise. Phone controls are effortless. Really easy to pick up and play, but every time, you get better and it gets harder.

NEED FOR SPEED - MOST WANTED: I haven't really played this that much yet. But after hearing that the Play store's Need For Speed game nickel-and-dimes you after you pay for the game (!), I'm sticking with this for my racing needs, thankyewverrrymuch.

That's all I've played so far. I'd love to hear other experiences with GBA games, especially ones that play well with the phone's on-screen controls!"	t5_2s2ul	True

1357407169.0	160izn	If you've been having trouble getting Fallout to run properly in DosBox Turbo, I think I've finally cracked the code...	PSBlake	55	14	9	"I've been trying to get Fallout 1 to work with full audio ever since I discovered the existence of DosBox Turbo, but it was an uphill struggle. After a disproportionate amount of tweaking, I managed to finally get it to start, but the audio was still barely there. I couldn't get ambient sounds, music, or audio in the cutscenes at all. I tried several different configurations of Fallout's internal .cfg file, as well as a number of potential setups for the DosBox config, but nothing seemed to get the sound working.

I knew that the original DOS version came with an installation program and audio setup utility, but these weren't included in the GOG version... or so I thought.

If you've bought Fallout 1 from GOG, you also have access to the Mac version. This might not normally seem important, except that the Mac version is actually a DosBox-wrapped version of the original Fallout 1 CD-ROM.

A second hurdle presented itself: The Mac version is a .dbg file. No problem, [7-Zip's](http://7-zip.org/) file manager can open .dbg files and extract the contents.

Reasoning that what worked with Daggerfall could possibly work with Fallout, I decided to extract the full contents of the original CD-ROM and perform the installation within DosBox itself.

Requirements:

* GOG version of Fallout 1
* 7-Zip file manager
* DosBox Turbo

1. Download the Mac version of Fallout 1 from GOG.
2. Open the .dbg file in 7-Zip's file manager.
3. Open the 4.hfs file within the .dbg file.
4. Follow the directory paths: Fallout/Fallout.app/Contents/Resources/Fallout.boxer/D Fallout.cdrom
5. Extract the entire contents of the ""D Fallout.cdrom"" directory to any path on your Android device. (I'll refer to the full path as [YourCDFolder] below)
6. Add this line to the start of your dosbox.conf file's Autoexec section\*:
    mount d: [YourCDFolder] -ioctl -label Fallout -t cdrom
7. You should also have a line which refers to ""mount c:"". Add this to the end of it\**:
    -freesize 700
8. Start DosBox. You can now install from the virtual version of the original CD in drive D. (Run INSTALL.EXE)
9. After installing, go to your installation directory and run SOUND.EXE.
10. You can now use the sound utility's autodetection feature, which will properly set everything for the virtual soundcard DosBox is currently using.\***
11. You can now run Fallout.exe, and be greeted by full sound.

\* - This line sets the contents of [YourCDFolder] as a CD-ROM with the disc label ""Fallout"" inserted into drive D. I don't know that the original disc was labeled ""Fallout"", but it worked, and I'm not going to question it.

\** - This is so the installation program sees that the target drive has enough free space to hold the game.

\*** - You may need to use SB16 in your dosbox.conf file. I wasn't able to get the sound utility to detect other versions of Sound Blaster."	t5_2s2ul	True

We set out to make an awesome looking, smooth playing 3D shooter that has it's roots firmly planted in an old school classic called AstroSmash which looked like this back in [1981](http://fc06.deviantart.net/images/large/wallpaper/wphoto/Astrosmash_Wallpaper.jpg)

So we took that idea, injected some high quality espresso into it and we ended up with Alpha Wave. We spent a good deal of time tweaking and polishing it and we really think the end result is a solid game. There are a lot of solid retro looking titles already saturating the market which is great but we think those high end GPU's in your phone were meant to really be pushed and punished! 

We proudly present to you... Alpha Wave!

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moz.government

I realise I got a little carried away with AndEngine on this project and being a mostly text game I don't think I needed to use it.  This is something I have learned for the future though and hopefully I won't waste time reinventing (badly!) the wheel!

The game is very simple stages at the moment, if anyone enjoys it even a little it would encourage me to work on it more.  

The model of the game is quite interconnected.  You run a political party from various starting points in history and you must please your voters aligning your parties political stance with any gaps in the market while proposing popular votes for all parties to vote on.  

For example you may only have 10% of the seats in government when you start the game, you must increase your popularity before the next election.  You may want to align yourself with a party of similar statue with more seats to try and push a change through that may influence the economy in a way that favors your own party more.

It doesn't have to be needlessly complex, but it should have at least some level of necessary interaction to progress.

It doesn't have to be an indefinitely lasting game, but something with a strong sense of progress and advancement the more time you invest into it.  Preferably not facebook-style web games, but it's not ruled out entirely if the premise is worth it.

The only requirement is that it runs on a lower-end MDPI smartphone and not be a freemium game that basically requires consistent purchases from a real-money store.  It could even be something I could run comfortably on an emulator.

So I've basically going onto Metacritic on the PS3 section and looking at the top all-time scores and picking up any games I haven't played. I haven't been disappointed. All of these games have provided an engaging environment, good balance, great onboarding and progression, and unique gameplay mechanics.

Metacritic doesn't have a category for Android games (they say because Android gaming doesn't have enough coverage).

I don't expect Skyrim on my tablet, but I know there are excellent games on Android--games that introduce new mechanics, provide an engaging environment, good progression, etc, and that use the touch screen well. Games like World of Goo and Anomaly. But they get buried beneath the addictive twitch games and the dozens of remakes of the same genre. How do you find them?

EDIT: To clarify, I'm not talking about sales in general, I'm talking about this weekend in particular because in the U.S., you generally see ""Memorial Day weekend"" sales, which is why you see some of these high-profile games going on sale in iTunes.

Final Fantasy had some audio stuttering during the launch FMV, but in game it worked fine.  Final Fantasy Tactics seemed to run 100%.  

Go download it and check it out because this is probably the first version where many games are fully playable and it's now a functional emulator.

&gt; ""This App is released for the United States and Canada.""

This sucks. I also didn't want to get the apk from some untrustworthy source. So I just forgot about it.

Today I read about the Chrome extension [ProxMate](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proxmate-unblock-the-inte/hgjpnmnpjmabddgmjdiaggacbololbjm) which easily disables country restrictions for some websites, i.e. YouTube. Very easy to use. I installed it on my PC and recognized it would also unblock Google Play. I thought okay, maybe lets give [Tamagotchi L.i.f.e.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.namcobandaigames.tamagotchilife) another try.

When logged in you can install apps by adding them to your Google account and sending them to your Android devices! After doing so, I opened Google Play on my mobile and went to ""My Apps"", et voilÃ  - it automatically started downloading and installing the app!

A few months ago I was introduced to Cytus through one of those ""recommend an Android game!"" threads. I was not disappointed with the $1.99 I spent to buy it. Cytus is innovative, extremely polished, and highly enjoyable. Over 10,000 reviews and it still maintains a solid 5-Star rating. 

The developers have recently updated the game with 10 new songs, and they've enacted a plan where every additional 100,000 downloads of the game will unlock another 10 new songs. Their goal is 1,000,000 downloads, which will unlock a full 100 songs.

The goal is slightly ambitious in my opinion, but I like this game so much that I thought I would do my part and spread the word. I urge you all to give this game a try. You might not be that into rhythm games, but I think you will appreciate the level of finish that has been put into Cytus."	t5_2s2ul	True

The highest grossing games on the Google play store are free to play, funded by in app purchases. They come in many forms. I found [this article](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/RaminShokrizade/20130626/194933/The_Top_F2P_Monetization_Tricks.php) to be an enlightening read on the subject.

I'm a long time gamer myself and I did indeed try some of the asian mmos that started this business model. I never spent any money on them though, as the author of the article states that seasoned gamers are not as prone to fall into such traps as they figure out the rules of the game quickly and see that it's rigged against them.

Wether this is just a passing fad or here to stay in one form or another, as I suspect. What do we think of it ? Is it sometimes ok for a game to have a cash shop ? Is it ok if it's just content or permanent upgrades ? Is it ok if it has game currency you can purchase, like the ever present ""gems"" everywhere ? Is it only ok if they are vanity items and no powerups ? Is it always just a trick or a trap ?

Developers need to earn money to make and run their games. On the Android market and I think on the IOS market, this is the way games make the most money at present. Developers have to adapt to the market, don't they ? It seems gamers on Android, on reddit at least, are fine with playing a game for free but get all riled up when they need to pay to continue.

I've bought many full priced games in my life and played games with subscriptions (WoW). My opinion on the ""freemium"" model is shifting a bit. There must be a right and a wrong way to do it. Where is the line ?

Sorry for ranting on, but I would like it if we could have a little discussion on the subject without just complaining about its' existence.

If you're not aware, they also have a (rather optimistic IMO) incentive plan where they will release a new chapter (~10 new songs) at every 100k paid downloads. (They have released the odd bonus track too, to keep everyone happy in the meantime)

Well, they hit the 100k mark yesterday... and have announced that v3.0 will be released TOMORROW!

I for one am creaming ones chuddies at the prospect, and if rhythym-tappy games are you thing you should definitely head on over to the store and grab yourself a copy. Â¦D

1358198754.0	16koap	I bought a Nyko PlayPad Pro controller, and want to warn you all about them	Zuxicovp	41	19	12	"So I picked up the controller yesterday, and I can say, in terms of feel, it's nice. It is comfortable to hold, light, and feels rather solid. The micro USB cable that it comes with is good, and the port on the controller is of good build quality. 

This is where the good part ends. 

What kills the controller (for me, at least) is the rest of it. It pairs well with android via Bluetooth, just go to the settings and pair by holding the home button on the face of the controller for a few seconds. Android recognizes it as a gamepad, which is expected. 

However, in terms of control mapping, your pretty much screwed. They have a app, which they label as *beta* (which is a generous overstatement) available in the play store. It is supposed to have support to map touch controls, which they advertise on the box of the controller, however they mention in their barren FAQ on their site that it is a WIP and should be added Q1 of this year, 2013. Then, in that same post, they mention that due to restrictions in android 4.1, they cannot bring touch mapping. 

The box claims to support 1000's of games; which it might, but not with any sort of useable controls. Their app doesn't allow mapping of in game controls, instead using some convoluted process that is unusable on my current android phone due to the app being in Tablet mode, with no phone UI of any sort. 

The app also runs in the background, and â€¢cannot be exitedâ€¢ unless you force quit using the dev control ""hold back button to force quit"" or by rebooting. 

The app is finicky, wanting you to unpair your controller, then reopen the app and pair it there. 

The included stock control layouts are only for ~8 games, and are not the greatest. 

You cannot use any sort of gamepad mapping app, such as Bluez, USB/BT joystick, etc. to configure the controls. They either do not support (Bluez) or do not recognize (joystick center) the controller at all. 

A few emulators that have native gamepad support and offer control mapping work well, but other than that, I would highly suggest finding a different controller to use at the time of writing. 

I will include some pictures of the controller later, for proof. "	t5_2s2ul	True

In short, having two balls for a minute is fine, but having 4 balls for 20 seconds is great. Players earn more balls by hitting the center peg and earn additional points by hitting the small pegs that make a pattern.



It might be a bit difficult at first, but once you get the hang of it, I believe the game is pretty fun. 



We kept the interface as simple as possible to make it playable no matter what language you speak. 



We appreciate any constructive criticism. 

Oh, and the game is free!

1364261237.0	1b0i01	The question of Survivalcraft vs MCPE comes up more frequently so I've attempted to lay out my reasons for choosing SC over MCPE.	jesusice	26	7	12	"*This has already taken up too much of my potential alcohol and Eclipse time so I'm gonna go ahead and just jump in. Please feel free to ask clarifying questions or discuss amongst yourselves in the comments.*


Survivalcraft does not have multiplayer yet but the community sharing feature makes up for it. The dev has built in an **in-game sharing system** so you can easily upload and share your builds and try others. Same for block textures. Some say that MCPE has better textures than SC, that's fine. MCPE style textures and many others can be changed via a quick visit to the in-game settings. No restart needed or anything. I cannot build elaborate cities and landscapes, but there are many others who can and its an easy thing to download their worlds in-game and gape in awe at their creations.

SC has **better developer support**. Even though SC is developed by just one person it consistently adds new features, refines others, and keeps you excited with each update. The developer of SC takes time to keep the community updated via his blog with well thought out reasons for any changes or new features and makes frequent videos demonstrating or just teasing new features. It really keeps the excitement building. SC is a great game that is getting better all the time. MCPE was a crappy game with a great community for a long time (I mean, like a full year it was ridiculous) and just recently has been becoming a decent game. For a long time it seemed Mojang had forgotten about it.

With just it's one man development team SC has managed to add features that the MCPE devs dismiss. **Infinite worlds**, **caves**, and even **buckets** are said to not be doable, citing limitations in mobile processing yet SC has *all those things*. Plus, **weather effects** (snow, rain, thunder and lightening), a **realistic sky** with sun and moon and stars. I mean, a *beautiful* sky. Sunsets and sunrises paint the sky ablaze in colors. I've spent many screenshots just on sunsets and rises. MCPE players were recently excited when they introduced a couple white blocky puffs in the sky for clouds yet there is still no sun or moon.

The world of SC is **alive**! Various birds populate the skies and lay their eggs in the grasses. Bulls keep a watchful eye on their cows, charging fearlessly at intruders while wild boar patrol the swampy lowlands. Majestic white polar bears guard the frozen tundra while brown and black bears make their dens deep in dark caves. At night packs of ferocious wolves howl and growl at the door, changing to fearsome werewolves when the moon is full. With the next update will come **aquatic creatures**, including sharks, 2 kinds of manta rays, and piranha and also **horses that can be tamed and ridden**.

SC has **electrics!** Pressure plates, logic gates, photodiodes, lights, detonators, switches, buttons, LEDs, whatever you need for your Rube Goldberg dreams!

**Mining is not a chore in SC**! Immense branching **cave systems** give easy access to underground resources. The resources you find are plentiful, for example one coal block in SC gives you 3 chunks of coal. In MCPE mining is tedious drudgery.

The developers of MCPE have stated that desktop MC style crafting cannot be easily done on mobile and instead have this cheap feeling list system for crafting. SC has **real MC style crafting** and it is intuitive and works great, complete with recipes and descriptions for all the items. 

SC has **fire**. Seriously, fire is fun. Burn down trees that are in your way or disrespectful wolves, you have the power.


**On multiplayer:** Kaalus, the developer of SC, has said that he plans to add multiplayer but wants to pick as many low lying fruit as possible first. Meaning that since multiplayer will probably consume his entire development effort for some time once he starts he wants to make the game as feature rich as possible first so that we do not get bored waiting.

So, as has been said many times - If you must have multiplayer then MCPE. If not, SC.

If you are interested in Survivalcraft please join us in /r/survivalcraftthegame. Thank you for reading.

EDIT: Check out the [Survivalcraft blog here](http://kaalus.wordpress.com/) to see what updates to SC are in store and to see the kind of attention that the dev shows to the game and it's players.

**An additional thought**

MCPE developers have confirmed that the next update won't be out until [at least the end of April](https://twitter.com/jbernhardsson/status/313656714509565954) and Survivalcraft [only costs $4](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.candyrufusgames.survivalcraft&amp;feature=nav_other#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDYsImNvbS5jYW5keXJ1ZnVzZ2FtZXMuc3Vydml2YWxjcmFmdCJd) so really **you should just buy SC** even if you already own MCPE or plan on buying MCPE.

So far I have tried:

- [Medieval castle defense](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nova.root&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5ub3ZhLnJvb3QiXQ..). It's free, and I've only seen one ad during the entire time playing it. This is a ""path"" TD game, which I don't like so much, but it's pretty challenging. Biggest drawback is that you can only speed it up 2x, which can be very slow. 

- [Myth Defense LF](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=smpxg.mythdefense&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsInNtcHhnLm15dGhkZWZlbnNlIl0.). I've tried the light version.

* It has more comprehensive categories for games (i.e. platformer, RPG, shooter)

* They often feature/give a small review of games. As well they have a user submitted pros/cons section that accumulates all the criticism/praise into one convenient place.

* It's available on the [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bestappsmarket.android.bestapps&amp;hl=en)





Also...they apparently have the [game genome project](http://www.gamegenomeproject.com/) coming soon...which looks interesting.

I'd love to play some good Android games. Some games that will still be good in 5 or 10 years. Some games that could make people say ""I want to buy a smartphone just to play THIS game"".

But most games I find on the Play Store are essentially all the same. Some Doodle Jump clone, sidescrolling running games, 3D running games, yet-another match3 game with in-app mediocrity, city growing games, one button arcadey games (think Jetpack Joyride), quizz games, etc...
I don't want to play flash games from 10 years ago, ported to Android. I'd like new things. Games that are on a touchscreen, mobile, connected device BECAUSE touchscreen, mobility and connectiveness suits them best. Games tailored for an Android device, that may even be bad games on another platform, but are real masterpiece on a smartphone/tablet.

I may have missed some real good games, as I'm relatively new to the Android world.

I never fully 100% completed Chaos Rings on iOS, but took advantage of the Square-Enix sale and repurchased both available games in the Play store since I know my future mobile gaming will continue to be on Android.

If you have a save game on an iOS device, you can copy the save files (system.dat and data.dat) from *Chaos Rings/Documents* and copy them to your Android device's */data/data/com.square_enix.chaosrings.googleplay/files* folder.

On iOS you don't have to be jailbroken and I'd imagine there are many options just googled and I found the free Phone Disk app on Mac or PC which worked.  Also on Android I don't think you even need to be rooted to access /data/data folder on your device, just use your favorite file explorer.

They don't have to be new. You don't have to give a review, it could be just one game. Just contribute!

My current list

1. [Little Empire](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.camelgames.fantasyland&amp;feature=search_result) - Really enjoy coming back to this game.

I feel like I get the shaft a bit on leveling up and unlocking classes though. Easy to re-pick up. Very unique in a good way. I love seeing this blend of new casual with older concepts because the casual is so much better suited for phones but they have lost the conceptual appeal I love with soldiers/knights/etc etc. Also you will definitely know whether or not you want to keep it within 15 minutes.

3. [Robotek](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.hexage.robotek.hd&amp;feature=search_result) - nice little game for when your bored. Low attention, easy to re-pick up.

4. [chess.com](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chess&amp;feature=search_result) - I have multiple online games running. They have videos to help teach you basics. Subscription not necessary for basic videos (for more advanced then yes).

5. [Battleloot Adventures](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.dtales.BLA&amp;feature=search_result) - I really want to like this game. If they make a second game I'm definitely going to take another look. I also wish the pace was increased. I keep playing it briefly again though.

Now we've released version 2.0 and tried to address a lot of the feedback we had gotten! It was extremely useful and we really appreciate it! Our game is now a bit more fun to play thanks to you!

We got a lot of feedback about the beginning of the game being too easy and not interactive enough. So we've made it a bit more difficult and focused on interactivity. We've added the ability to prioritize targets and made your ships abilities recharge much faster leading to a much more active game!

We've also simplified the UI a bit and added some new effects for the enemy weapons to make it less confusing. A lot of players were not sure what they could or couldn't do or really how to play the game so we added a handy guide to the main menu.

And of course, we also added a few bug and crash fixes. Thanks again to all of you that gave us feedback and checked out our game! Hopefully it's a little more fun and if you have any more feedback we'd love to hear it!"	t5_2s2ul	True

Get 3 shortcuts posted on my front page, then it wants to scan my android for viruses...  On top of that it couldn't even play Zelda OOT properly. Hopefully it didnt add any other malware as I quickly installed it. 

Could someone point me in the direction of where to buy/download the best N64 emulator?

1354290228.0	141zg8	Mame4droidReloaded - Works great for me after finding the correct romset, great for classic arcade games.	plasticslug	24	9	20	"My life is now complete once I found Mame4droidreloaded. Im posting this 
after a great, great deal of frustration after trying to find a working rom to go with this emulator. 

It turns out that this emulator runs Mame .139 and their seems to monopoly on these roms as the only site I found (if google for this romset) wants you to be a premium member to download. So I found a working torrent on XDA, unfortunately its 25 gigs.  Again, traditional romsets will NOT WORK with this emulator, you need roms that are taylored .139 Mame, which is a complete pain in the ass.

But after playing Aliens vs predator, Marvel vs Capsom, Samauri Showdown, Metal Slug it was well worth the massive download. 

I know were not here to promote piracy, I am just here to say that the emulator works fantastic with my **Note 2**. 

**EDIT** Also note that many of the roms I tested DO NOT work with the alternative emulator Mame4Droid (.037b5)
and work only on  MAME4droid reloaded (0.139) so doing a little research at this time to see if Mame4droid reloaded is the better choice...

Also note that that reloaded supports more rom sets and allows saving, on the alternative Mame4Droid (.037b5) the developer states ""MAME4droid will never have ""save states"" since it is based on a MAME version that does not support it."" 

So it seems Reloaded is the better option. 

Playstore link- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seleuco.mame4droid&amp;feature=more_from_developer#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEwMiwiY29tLnNlbGV1Y28ubWFtZTRkcm9pZCJd

**Lastly** I would recommend going browsing though the torrent picking up a few choice rom, to try out. 25 gigs, is a big bandwidth/time investment and with all emulators the faster the device the better the performance.

If you aren't familiar with the game, you can see a bit about it [here](http://store.steampowered.com/app/70400/). Basically, the concept of the game is that you explore dungeons to find stuff to stock the shelves of your shop in the hopes of paying off a massive debt you owe. You hire adventurers to help you in the dungeon, and any gear you find or buy, you can give to them to make them more powerful so you can go deeper into the dungeons and find better stuff. You pitch prices to the consumers who come in to buy stuff, and haggle with them to get the best price, whether they're buying from you, or trying to sell you something.

So far I love the look and feel of it, and the simplicity of it too. However, maybe it's just me, but the game balance of effort-vs-reward seems totally out of whack.

For instance, a massive wave of creeps will come storming through at high speed, just barely being killed off by a winding passage of upgraded rocket towers and goop guns, and my reward is enough money to upgrade... one rocket tower plus change? Or a beast of a creep comes through, taking a dozen or so upgraded rocket towers and half a dozen goop guns, and I get enough reward to buy... one rocket tower?

Also, some creeps come through super fast and seem to be upgraded, hardier versions of slower, more vulnerable creeps, yet the payoff is the same? Or some creeps are just a bitch to kill, but the payoff is only $2, while a pansy little grunt of a creep that can be killed with a brand new machine gun tower gives you $1.

Note that this is on Medium difficulty. Maybe I just suck at this particular TD game, but the balance doesn't seem right.

So far I've tried [Townsmen](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hg.townsmen7free) and [The Simpsonsâ„¢: Tapped Out](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.game.simpsons4_row)

Townsmen is fine, but it feels kinda ... frustrating? ... after some time when every villager is complaining about this and that (even when they have it).

And Simpsons is driving me mad when they try their best to force me to spend sooo much money.


So can you guys suggest me something? Thanks for any responses :) ."	t5_2s2ul	True

I love ALL the kairosoft games, lke Game Dev Story and such. But since they are either slowing down or gotten old (and i have yet to see that star command game...) I am searching for something new.

I was thinking of doing that Weed Farmer game, but dunno if i would like it.

So I just got an Android tablet and decided to find out what videogames it had to offer. For the most part, there doesn't seem to be any Android exclusives that I will remember years down the line. Most of the decent games are ports from other systems that I've already played. Maybe I just don't know where to look, so I would appreciate your help.

Here's a list of games I have found entertaining and relatively easy to control without some sort of gamepad peripheral.



**Free Games:**

[Dead Trigger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.madfingergames.deadtrigger&amp;feature=search_result) - FPS. You kill zombies for free. Good visuals.

[Order &amp; Chaos Duels](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftBTHM&amp;feature=search_result) - CCG. Not nearly as deep as some of its competitors, but the presentation is miles above. Rare card packs are expensive, but you get free cards at a fair rate.

[Angry Birds](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rovio.angrybirds&amp;feature=search_result) - To be honest, I don't see what's so fantastic about it. I've installed it and tried it, and I intend to figure out its secret allure that has entranced so many others.

[Fruit Ninja](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.halfbrick.fruitninjafree&amp;feature=search_result) - Slide finger across screen. Cut fruit. I don't know how to explain it, but it's one of the most cathartic things I've ever done.

[Plants vs Zombies](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.popcap.pvz_row&amp;feature=search_result) - Get those zombies off your lawn with plants. Even better on android than it was when I played it on my PC. Them touch controls.

[Solitaire](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brainium.solitairefree&amp;feature=search_result) - The best version of Klondike on the app store in my opinion. Slick interface and great customization.



**Paid Games:**

[Bejeweled 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eamobile.bejeweled2_row_wf&amp;feature=search_result) - It's okay. Blunt honesty? I've had more fun emulating the old Pokemon Puzzle Challenge game for the GBC.

[Battleheart](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.KelliNoda.Battleheart&amp;feature=search_result) - Strategy RPG. There are MANY free clones out there, all of which nickle and dime you pretty hard. I recommend you just get this instead.

[Worms 2: Armageddon](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.worms2armageddon.app&amp;feature=search_result) - The controls are not as tight as I hoped, but it's still a lot of fun. Customize your worms with some hilarious costumes and accents and enjoy the ridiculous weaponry.

[Rayman Jungle Run](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pastagames.ro1mobile&amp;feature=search_result) - Platformer. Rayman meets Temple Run. Easy to grasp, looks beautiful, soundtrack is great. Highly recommend this over, say, Sonic 4.

[Penny Arcade 3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tinkerhousegames.paa3&amp;feature=search_result) - Hilarious retro-RPG from the good folks at PA. Sucks that you literally play the story on rails, though.

[Anomaly Korea](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elevenbitstudios.AnomalyKorea&amp;feature=search_result) - I own the steam version of the first title and love it. Got this one, was not disappointed. Reverse-Tower Defense game. Looks, sounds, and plays great.

[Final Fantasy 3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.FFIII_GP&amp;feature=search_result) - This is the Nintendo DS version of FF3 with touch controls and higher internal resolution. If you don't own this on the DS, I suggest you give it a go here.

[Dead Space](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.deadspace_row&amp;feature=search_result) - Surprisingly good visuals and perfect framerate. A third person shooter with controls that are easy to pick up. Haven't played much of it yet, so I can't vouch for the story, but it seems decent for a portable spinoff."	t5_2s2ul	True

It's not a question of content. Here we have lots of games posted daily. Reviews, and interesting articles that promote healthy discussions.

Should we post more links to /r/androidgaming on the general sub?

1359504471.0	17j17y	Beta Testers needed for our first big mobile game, Towelfight 2	BscotchShenani	25	11	16	"Reddit!

My brother and I started an indie studio a few months back and are on our way
to our first full launch. We're terrified and excited, and in need of some feedback.

Towelfight 2: The Monocle of Destiny is a crazy blend between Zelda and the Binding of Isaac that has you free a god from his unwanted prison by shooting animals out of your face.

**Screenshots**

[Absolute craziness later on](https://twitter.com/BScotchShenani/status/294221439148621824/photo/1)

It has 4 zones, 10 bosses, 40 weapons, and a Pug. Our rough guess of playtime is about 8-14 hours, depending on how often you DIE.

We're nearly there and are doing a few weeks of beta testing before the launch to make sure the game is as sound as it can possibly be. We've already gotten a bucketful of feedback from some redditors and thought we'd formalize the process, spreading the beta to droid and iOS devices (the other was on PC/Mac, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/175liq/my_brother_and_i_went_indie_and_made_a_game_about/) is a link to that post).

Here's a [box.net]( https://www.box.com/s/f0gwdolr1szhz7ytrzoy) link to the apk, which, being a beta version, is set to expire on March 1st.

We're planning on releasing it for $2.99. We aren't keen on IAP but realize that some people like being able to get upgrades super fast, so we're overlaying an IAP system (Shady's Cheat Shack) if people are into that sort of thing.

We'll respond to feedback you post here, too. So feel free to be chatty!

**EDIT:**
We've been polishing, debugging, balancing, and slapping this thing into shape since yesterday, based on your feedback and some testing of our own. We're uploading a new APK, which you can download and install from the original link. Your save data will carry over between versions, so no progress lost!

1375979610.0	1jyq4u	An augmented reality Android game [X-post r/IndieGaming]	vbarthel	18	4	12	"Hello everyone!

Since July, my twin brother and I have been developing an augmented reality game for Android Smartphones. It's called ""Chase Whisply"" and is about to becoming our first released game. We are two computer science students with a tremendous passion for games =)

---------------------------------------
*The Game*

Whisply and his twin brothers invaded our houses and our streets a long time ago. But we weren't aware of this invasion, because, you know, we can't see ghosts, right? Thanks to this application, we can now detect them in order to find them and kill them. As you may have already understood, this game is a FPS. It changes your Smartphone into a gun sights that reveals ghosts in a 360 degree world.

---------------------------------------
*The Beta Test*

We have just released a beta version. You can access the app through the Google community [ChaseWhisply](https://plus.google.com/communities/104127077976914732043). To access the App with the current Google beta test system, you have to **join** the community to download the Game. I hope this ""community"" thing won't stop people from testing :s

---------------------------------------
*The Code Source*

""Chase Whisply"" is an **open source project**. If you are a confirmed developers or beginners, you might be interested in [the source code](https://github.com/tvbarthel/ChaseWhisplyProject).

From France, With Love &lt;3

---------------------------------------
**TL;DR**: We made an augmented reality game. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/tvbarthel/ChaseWhisplyProject) and test the beta version from [there](https://plus.google.com/communities/104127077976914732043), you have to join the community, however.

Arsenal: War Hammer +4, Plate Armor + 6, (and this, the killer) Ring of Thorns +1

Potion &amp; scroll: Mind vision, Remove curse, Identify.

Wands from left to right: Firebolt +4, Flock, Regrowth, Regrowth.

On 3rd pic you can see I own a Mace +1. That's my lucky item, which I got in floor 1 from animated statue, and bring me ease for the rest of play. Vampiric Mace +1. However I ""lost"" it on previous floor. A monk kicked it out and I had to run to next floor because I ran out of HP.


For the ring I got it from Goo. I can't believe I'll say this but Thanks Goo!

So basically it's the mace and ring who save my play. Next I'll try with Rogue.

Okay so I imagined a reddit browser combined with a rpg. You'd make a party and your level would be based on how much karma you have. To downvote a post you'd have a quick final fantasy style battle where the monster type was chosen based on the post's subreddit.

Just an example is this flash game I used to play on my laptop called ""Kingdom Rush"". I saw it was ported on Android and bought it since it had a 4.7 rating and was a successful port.

The game was just like what I played free on my laptop on a website. I soon realized that they had added a new currency which would buy you extra weapons, currency you can either acquire slowly by completing the game multiple times over or you can buy for money. 

I hate the fact that when you buy games they still have 2 or 3 kinds of in game currency, one of which always has to be bought. This makes no sense what so ever. Either make a game which follows the freemium model or either take whatever money you want before hand.  I am not going to keep paying you in micro transactions and your third currency is not letting me enjoy the game I already paid for.

I think that at least in the paid games the play store should tell you in advance if a game has additional content you have to pay for because I wouldn't buy it purely for that reason. Also users keep rating these games 5^* to further promote this model.

Even worse is that I can use GameCIH to give me as much of this third currency so you are never getting anything exclusive and in each one of these games, even multiplayer, someone always has a score of 99999 or a level of 9999 so enjoy paying 12,000 pounds to reach that."	t5_2s2ul	True

As well, does anyone else find the 'race against a real person's time' thing to be BS?

Haven't seen much talk about any specific games recently - and dying to find a new one.  Most of the 'what are the best x"" genre threads have all the same old replies; recommendations of games released a significant amount of time ago.

Personally, I'd like to find a good RTS game (with none of the bullshit hours-long cool-down limitations).  I really like the style and direction of Kingdom Conquest II, but seeing as I've just started, have my doubts on its overall quality (horribly slow interface).  Hit a dead-end in Spectral Souls - really want to get into that game but the depth of this SRPG is kicking my ass right now.  Kemco's Symphony of Eternity bought on sale as well - but that's embarrassingly easy.  Would love to get a final fantasy game but their pricing is very steep - got chaos rings on sale and it was really disappointing (personally).

It's hard to keep attention focused on one game when there are thousands available instantly...

1359408506.0	17gag3	Why I am developing an Android game	gameofinches	25	11	4	"Hi /r/AndroidGaming,

I have been working on an Android football game for a bit now and wanted to share why. About a year ago I discovered [John Elway's Quarterback Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M0pmI_9s7Q) and loved it. Soon after I bought 2 of [these](http://www.amazon.com/Classic-USB-NES-Controller-PC/dp/B002YVD3KM) and was playing it and [Tecmo Super Bowl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PBvOxicz-0) with my friends all the time.

After expending my friends' patience I moved on to Android. I searched high and low and couldn't find a football game that would satisfy my addiction for games like the two mentioned above. That's when I decided to start working on a football game myself. 

Right now it's my side project and development is so very slow since my job takes priority. That is why I just launched a [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/108259147/game-of-inches) and hope to raise the funding to allow me to work on it full time. I know 15K seems like a lot but I assure you every cent goes into the game. 

Here is a list of all the Android games I have tried as well as some notes and their ratings. Hopefully this list helps those like me until I can get Game of Inches on the market. 
________________

**2D Top-Down Arcade Style Football Games**
&gt; These are what I love. Sadly none of the following are even near being considered completed games. 

[Super Touchdown](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apostek.apps.touchfootball) *4.3 Stars* - Not too bad but very easy to figure out how to score every play. 

[Go Long! Football](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wco.android.golongpc) *3.8 Stars* - A unique mechanic but forces you to choose a receiver at the start of each play. 

[Phil's Football](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.philgame) *3.8 Stars* - Sloppy art and interface. Design is awkward, place one finger on QB to pause game and second on receiver to throw. 

________________

**3D Football Games**
&gt;Most of these to be very well built and pretty to look at but not very user friendly. If I want to play a realistic football game I would do so at home on my X-Box. 

[NFL PRO 2013](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftF3HM) *4.5 Stars*

[Mobile Linebacker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viva.linebacker&amp;feature=apps_topselling_paid) *4.2 Stars*

[Backbreaker 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideaworks3d.tackle2&amp;feature=apps_topselling_paid) *3.3 Stars*

[NFL Rivals](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.naturalmotion.nflrivals&amp;feature=apps_topselling_paid) *2.7 Stars*
________________

**Football Simulators**
&gt;Basically you get to be the coach and pick the plays as well as trade players. Very different from the traditional arcade style football but great for people who like fantasy sports. 

[Big Win FOOTBALL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hotheadgames.google.free.bigwinfootball) *4.3 Stars* - This is definelty worth taking a look at if you like simulators. Very well done and beautiful environment. 

[Touch Foorball Beta](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anndconsulting.touchfootballbeta) *3.2 Stars* - Terrible, littered with adds and agreements. Once I got past that the game wouldn't function well enough to play a full round of football. I guess it is beta though :/

[tXtFL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.textflex.txtflmobile) *3.4 Stars* - Fairly boring and not intuitive. 
________________

**Single Task**
&gt;These have taken a single aspect from football and made a mini-game out of it. 

[Flick Kick Field Goal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pikpok.kikfg&amp;feature=apps_topselling_paid) *4.3 Stars*

[NFL QB 13](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fullfat.android.quarterback13&amp;feature=top-paid) *3.4 Stars*
________________

**Other?**
&gt;Weird stuff

[Football Golf](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.morens.games.footballgolf) *No Raitings* - I was really digging deep when I found this gem. This game is actually a lot of fun and the only reason I included and other section. It's not perfect but I would certainly recommend it.

I decided to make an Android game, and for extra fun to *use nothing but my Asus Transformer tablet* to make *all* the assets, write *all* the code, and even compile it.  

The game is [Burning Platform](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scriptocalypse.games) and is available for both phones and tablets on Google Play.  

Keep your friends from falling off the burning platform in this top-down game.  Tilt the device to move your friends, and touch to draw walls.

The gameplay is pretty simple, as are the graphics. If you're curious, the tools I used to create the game are:


* AIDE - A Java IDE and Android app compiler (yes, the game was compiled on the tablet)

* Pixelesque - An MSPaint style app

* Plasma Sound - A Theremin app, useful for making SFX

* SPC Music Sketch Pad 2 - A beat box app

* Tape Machine - A post process sound editor for chopping up the sfx and exporting the music as .ogg


The game engine was from chapters 3-5 of the ""Beginning Android Games"" book. It was transcribed by hand from the book into AIDE.

The objective is to complete the mini-levels by reaching the Goal at the end, but there are enemies that make you explode on contact. For a bigger challenge there's a Bonus that item you can collect before reaching the Goal. 

Controls: Tap on the screen towards the spot you want to move. Alternatively there's an ""anywhere joystick"" mode you can activate on the options.

I hope you like it! You can ask me any questions or make suggestions here! Also, please tell me if it crashes (hopefully not).

----------

**Method to unlock full version from free version:**

**1)** Since the full version lets you access mission 4 and beyond, you're going to have to beat mission 3 anyways, so the unlock method starts in mission 3.

**2)** Get to the point where you fight the boss (as long as the boss exists in the game world at this point)

**3)** Go into the pause/upgrade menu, and view your mission objective. Then press ""back"", then view mission objective again, then go back again, etc. Do this 11 or so times without exiting/going back to gameplay, and you'll hear a sound effect. When you hear that effect, you've unlocked the full version! Yay!

**4)** Save that variable by either winning, losing or quitting the mission. I'm really sure all those events trigger the file save method in my code that will permanently enable the full version!

**TL;DR:** During the mission 3 boss fight, (view objectives&lt;--&gt;back)x11"	t5_2s2ul	True
