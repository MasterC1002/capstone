1336530948.0	te1cv	Hello there boys.	t00lshed462	101	19	38	"I am a mod over at r/devils. Just wanted to stop by (hopefully before any over exuberant devils fans) and say sorry for the exit. Sorry of course in a ""i know that feel bro"" more than ""wish it was us"" obviously.

I am a life long Devils fan, and we are taught to hate the Flyers, but damned if I don't respect them these past few years as a serious contenter and a hard team to beat. To be honest, I thought we were going to have a longer series, and we would have to really step up our game.

To my surprise, and I am sure yours, those were not the Flyers I know.  Give credit where credit is due though. The Devils payed attention, dug in, stepped up and figured out how to take advantage of that, and they got the wins. Flyers did very little adapting after the second game it seemed. It just seemed like the Devils wanted it more.

You guys will still be a top team in the Atlantic next year, and I look forward to our 6 regular season games, and the bonus ones after that in the post-season. Giroux is a beast, no denying.

Also, sorry about any rudeness from rogue devils fans in your subreddit. Don't let the actions of a few dictate your opinion of the whole. We all love our teams and some get more worked up than others.

Cheers, and we'll be in touch about the banner situation ;)

P.S. Don't hate on Bryz. One mistake in game 5 was not the reason you guys lost. Check the shot counts and box scores for the series. Cut him a little slack.

Splo	77	12	92	"If anyone is not aware, we made a subreddit banner wager with /r/Penguins before the series.  Loser has to display a banner of the winner's choosing until the winner is knocked out of the playoffs (or until the draft if one wins the cup).


A few caveats:

* Keep is classy
* Nothing NSFW
* Make it a normal sized banner, as in don't make the height abnormally tall or anything that would really screw up their layout.
* For the love of god no Memes
* Banners are restricted to PNG or JPG and will be resized to something like 300 px tall.


Other than that post in this thread to present your idea and tomorrow at some point, I'll choose one (most likely by most upvotes) to pass on to our buds in /r/Penguins.

All three were unforgettable experiences, like dreams come true. I was up in the cheap setas. The crowd was loud, boorish, intoxicated, downright rude, and fucking disgraceful.

I fucking loved it.

Seriously, two middle fingers to anyone who has anything to say about Philadelphia fans. There is no thrill that will match the excitement of the mob mentality when a proud and unsuspecting Giants fan enters the Linc. I respect the individuals and fans on opposing teams, but behavior at a game isn't about respect or disrespect, it's about the experience of being a Philadelphia sports fan. And fuck the Penguins dirty little whores.

Personally, I was very excited when we acquired him and couldn't wait to see what he could do for the team. But, now he's just become this plaything for the media. His interviews are sad to watch because reporters just try and give him stupid questions to get a certain response with him. I just feel like Philadelphia ruined him a bit. The false reports about him are just embarrassing. It has to suck going into a game knowing that everyone is already against you and just waiting for you to screw up. So, That's about it. I love Bryz and feel horrible about what he's gone through during his time here. Rant over.

Read - This kid can score. Him and Giroux will be a monster line for years to come.

Giroux - I hate to say it, but he has a lot of talent. I wouldn't be surprised if he wins the Richard, Art Ross, or Hart in the next few years. 

Voracek - Those goals he scored against the Pens were great looking goals. He has a bright future.

Briere - When the playoffs come around you can count on him to score. He is money in the playoffs

B Schenn - I don't know much about him, but I do know that he's going to be a great player in the future

Simmonds - Seems like a real stand up guy. I really like how when he came to Philly he embraced it as his new home so quickly.

Talbot - I fucking love this guy. Pittsburgh lost a great personality when he left for Philly. 

Couturier - Man, this kid is good. 

Knuble - I may hate this guy because he is a classic Penguin killer, but man did I want him to sign with the Pens. He provides that veteran presence that not many players have. 

Zolnierczyk - Dude has a really kickass last name. I love names that start with Z. It is such a great letter.

Fedotenko - He had some great years and was irreplaceable in the playoffs. 

Rinaldo - This kid can throw down when he needs to. 

Timonen - Probably the best Finnish Defenseman to play the game.

L Schenn - Great hitter. I mean, he is the Human Eraser.

Grossmann - I think it's cute that when he was young they misspelled his name ""Grossman"" and he never bothered to correct it because he was shy.

Gustafsson - I think it's great that he came to America to play college hockey for a shot in the NHL

Coburn - Solid dependable D-man. Sometimes it is hard to find players like this.

Gervais - I read on Wikipedia that he is the childhood best friend of Talbot, and I think it's cool that they get to play together in the NHL.

Bryzgalov - Easily one of my favorite players in the league solely for his interviews. He is hysterical and no matter who he plays for I can't find it in me to hate him. 

Hartnell - During the lockout I gained a lot of respect for Hartnell. He organized a charity game so that fans could get a fix of the sport that they missed so much and he raised money for those affected by Sandy. I hate the dude on the ice, but off the ice he seems like a really great dude

1361376650.0	18w3u9	I did the math, and it's probably going to take about 52-57 points for the Flyers to make the playoffs as an 8th seed	lookoutbeloww	63	1	28	"Warning: Wall of text and math.

**tl;dr** Flyers need to put a string of winning streaks together

Obviously I would rather the Flyers be higher than an 8 seed, but realistically at this point in the season I would just be happy for us to make the playoffs. Once the playoffs start anything could happen (ie. LA last year). There's 31 games left in the season, so the Flyers are gonna have to win 20 of the next 31 games to end the season with 55 points. A 55 point season would be the equivalent of a 94 point season in a normal 82 game season.


I looked at the past 8 NHL seasons to see how many points the 8th seed had heading into the playoffs and these were the results:


1. 2011-2012-   *Ottawa =* 92     *LA =* 95
1. 2010-2011-   *NYR =* 93         *Chicago =* 97
1. 2009-2010-   *Montreal =* 88   *Colorado =* 95
1. 2008-2009-   *Montreal =* 93   *Anaheim =* 91
1. 2007-2008-   *Boston =* 94     *Nashville =* 91
1. 2006-2007-   *NYI =* 92          *Calgary =* 96
1. 2005-2006-   *Tampa =* 92      *Edmonton =* 95
1. 2003-2004-   *NYI =* 91          *Nashville =* 91


Next thing I did was to figure out how to convert these results of a normal 82 game season into results for a condensed 48 game season. I did this by dividing 82 games by 48 games and got .5854. I then multiplied each 8th seed number by .5854 to find out how many points each team would have gotten in a 48 game season. These were the results:

* 88 points x .5854 = 51.5152 (Rounded to 52 points)
* 91 points x .5854 = 53.2714 (Rounded to 53 points)
* 92 points x .5854 = 53.8568 (Rounded to 54 points)
* 93 points x .5854 = 54.4422 (Rounded to 54 points)
* 94 points x .5854 = 55.0276 (Rounded to 55 points)
* 95 points x .5854 = 55.6130 (Rounded to 56 points)
* 96 points x .5854 = 56.1984 (Rounded to 56 points)
* 97 points x .5854 = 56.7838 (Rounded to 57 points)


So by using this formula, over the past 8 NHL seasons 5 teams would have ended with 54 points, 4 teams would have ended with 53 points, 4 teams would have ended with 56 points, and 1 team each would have ended 52 points, 55 points, and 57 points respectively. 


In the shortened 94-95 season the NY Rangers made the playoffs with 47 points out of the East, and the Dallas Stars made the playoffs with 42 points out of the West. However, in the 90's teams didn't need as much points to make the playoffs. For example, in the 93-94 season the Islanders made the playoffs with 84 points and the Sharks made the playoffs with 82 points. In the 95-96 season Tampa made the playoffs with 88 points and Winnipeg made the playoffs with 78 points. In the 96-97 season Montreal made the playoffs with 77 points and Chicago made the playoffs with 81 points.


In today's NHL it takes a lot more points for a team to secure a playoff spot, which is why I only used results of the past 8 seasons. I think if the Flyers could get anywhere between 53 to 56 points they would almost be a lock for the playoffs.

It's been a great year for me on Reddit, and for me watching hockey. I got to experience G's first goal of the season, revealing to me just how good a player he could be. I got to watch 24 7, the Winter Classic in Philly, Mark Howe's jersey retirement, Bryz's stellar month of March, reminding us all that behind all that talk of Philosophy is a guy who can be the guy to bring the first Stanley Cup back to Philly since another ""all crazy"" goalie shut down the Sabres in '75. I got to see Jaromir Jagr, a player who always had my respect even though played for some of our greatest rivals, play an awesome year in Orange (his point totals weren't amazing, but his goofy smile always lit me up inside). I got to see us take down the critics favourite, Pittsburgh Penguins in 6 amazing games, including Voracek's OT winner in game 1 (still my cover photo on facebook, and will be for a long time) ,which was my personal highlight of the season. 

This was an amazing season for me. It's a shame it ended so badly at the hands of some some fat-ass goalie and an overpaid Russian has-been (I'm still bitter, any Jersey fans that may be reading this. Don't take offence) I could have been celebrating this day on the eve of a ECF game 1, posting a generic game thread, reading through you guys' thoughts on the game, frantically checking twitter for line up changes. It's a shame it has to end this way, but hey, there's always next year. I have a really good feeling about next year. It's a feeling burning in my gut. We will take that Cup home soon. 

Lastly, here's to the 2,267 of you who read this subreddit, and the many of you who comment on a regular basis on it.

Life is about honoring the dead. Don't let that Boston Bruins season die in vane. (09-10 RIP. Never forget.)

The Devils are a good team but they are not unbeatable. We all know this team can be explosive, especially in come-from-behind positions. (twss) 

So pretty please, with a cherry on top, act like it's not over, because it's not.

All I'm saying is... there are seven games for a reason.

1335515402.0	sv17a	Dear /r/Flyers	Jimmus	59	5	51	"Greetings and salutations. 

First and foremost, congratulations on winning your series against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Seriously, fuck those guys.

Second, I'm looking forward to the upcoming series, as a Devils fan. During the season, there were some pretty amazing games between our two teams, and I'm sure this ECSF will be no different. 

You've got a pretty solid team to root for, and so do we Devils fans. We host some pretty civil game threads over on /r/Devils, and I would like to cordially invite you over there for some entertaining and lively discussions about the games. 

Best of luck to both teams, and I'm looking forward to some amazing hockey. "	t5_2ribt	True

So I figure, the Flyers are the best place to put it because of the following reasons, which range from admiration, to petty meanness. 

1. The other (likely) remaining teams are Southern, have also never won the Cup, or are Chicago. 
2. The other teams play defensive hockey. Booooo. 
3. Bryzgalov is hilarious, and your offensive depth makes me wet. 
4. Orange and black are amazing. 
5. I empathize with the reputation Philly fans get.

Ignore that he wanted to retire.  Ignore that he had the Flyers over a barrel because there's a shortage of good FA d-men.  Ignore that the Flyers are awful at landing FA d-men anyway.  Ignore our lack of prospects and weak defense.  Ignore all of these possible reasons for his ""inflated"" contract next season.

At 38, on a team with a defense now comprised of AHLers and Schenn, Timonen has been half a point-per game, plays all areas of the ice, is 4th in the NHL among defensemen in points, and has been a shut-down defender.  (Irrelevant, but next year he's probably heading to his 5th Olympics, capping off 20 years of Olympic-level ice hockey.)  And he's apparently been doing all of this this season while [playing on a broken foot](http://www.csnphilly.com/hockey-philadelphia-flyers/kimmo-timonen-miss-final-three-games).

Sure, Voracek has had a break-out season, and Timonen has certainly lost a step since his late-20s/early-30s, and I take everything Panatch says with several grains of salt.  But Kimmo is the poor man's Lidstrom and deserves recognition for that.  In my eyes, he's been the most important player on this team this year, especially with all of the injuries in our ""defensive core""."	t5_2ribt	True

We shouldn't forget the positives:

* Voracek blossomed.  We had hoped he could fill what we lost with Jagr, and at 23 he's already doing that.
* Giroux had an off-year with a rotisserie at the left wing.  But he still ended up at a point-per-game.  He also didn't get maimed or traded yet, so maybe the captain curse is finally over.
* The JVR-Schenn trade looks good.  Schenn has clearly become a top 4 defenseman, maybe even top 2 in a year or so.
* Bryz played better than last year.  He'll look even better when we get some team defense (if we keep him).
* Mason looks to be competing for the top spot in net, though it might still be too early.  This is a good problem to have.
* Hartnell looked to be finding more of a groove late, though I doubt we'll see him on the first line again.
* Schenn and Coots, overall, were better this year.  Schenn's still streaky but was much better driving offense forward.  His development still has him trending up which, for a 21 year old 2nd line center, is a very good thing.  Couturier was quietly the best defensive center in the league at the age of 20, and looks to be able to contribute offensively as well.  In short: the Flyers have their centers for the next 5 years, if they want.
* Gus became a consistent NHL defenseman.  Still needs more experience, though.
* Lauridsen looks to be able to contribute defensively as well, but still needs experience.
* Konan and Manning didn't look *too* out of place in the back either.
* That Akeson kid might earn another look.
* Timonen had a stellar year with one foot. 
* **edit:** As pointed out by /u/mooseflake, I left out Rinaldo, who definitely deserves mention. In the words of mooseflake, ""he really proved himself to be more than just a fighter, he caused a few PP's by instigating and angering the other players, plus his skills are definitely developing as a dump and chase style player.""  Thanks!
* **edit2:** As /u/kynx pointed out, Simon Gagne came back to Philly.  Hopefully his veteran presence helps this team mature, especially in the event Briere gets bought out.  Also, it'd be nice to see him find his shooting touch again.

Also, a thanks to everyone for making this subreddit awesome.  From the facelift this place has gotten to the excellent mods, /r/Flyers has become a great team sub with a great, knowledgeable community.  It's going to suck watching the playoffs from the outside, but at least it'll be good hockey, and we have the Worlds to watch.  Also, we'll probably see some trade-slinging from Holmgren, for better or for worse.  Continue being magnificent.  Go Flyers."	t5_2ribt	True

1361755232.0	195wyz	Dear r/Flyers, please help a confused Senators Fans	Glussell	47	6	59	"Flyers fans, I need help understanding something. Last week like all of you I watched a fantastic Flyers-Penguins game and I was enthralled by all of the hatred exhibited by both sides. This rivalry to me is hands down the best, most compelling one in the NHL with Chicago-Vancouver as a very distant second.

In fact the NHL seems to think so as well, just look at the Realignment Proposals! If we paid attention to geography then Pittsburgh and Columbus would be swapped in with the Northeast teams and Florida and Tampa would go with you guys. After watching these games, I'm all for the NHL ignoring geography (and having my team travel more) in place of more compelling games. Hell, I wish that the NHL could do an all-Pennsylvania division!

So here's where I need some help: why do people tell me that Flyers-Rangers is the bigger rivalry? I don't get it one little bit! I know HBO told us that these two teams loathe one another, but you don't really see it on the ice, not the same way. So where does this come from? Looking through the history of these teams we can see that they had a few playoff series in the late 90s but those weren't too vicious from what I recall.

So be honest here, where does this come from? Is it just a city rivalry? Is it an overflow of NFL and MLB rivalries? 

Thanks a ton for the help, and while I'm at it: screw the Maple Leafs, we can all agree on that one, right?"	t5_2ribt	True

1374678847.0	1iyk7q	In defense of Brayden Coburn...	rockerlkj	49	10	87	"This post is inspired by a thread on /r/hockey about the player you hate the most on your team, and someone picked Coburn. Understandably, he does get a lot of unjust criticisms, and a lot of people are demanding his head on a platter and to trade him somewhere. 

On Broadstreet Hockey's podcast last week, they briefly discussed Coburn and the defencive situation. Coburn REALLY doesn't deserve the hate he got. It was explained very well on their podcast. Coburn played with Timonen a lot in the past, and so didn't need to do much offencively. This year, he played a lot with Grossmann, neither of which are gifted with the puck. This forced Coburn to play more offencively, which lead to more mistakes, and consequently, hate from the fans, which he doesn't deserve. 

Schenn and Timonen are a lock for one of the pairings, this year, and with Streit joining, Coburn could become the incredibly effective defensive defenseman he was in the past again. With Streit (being an incredibly effective puck mover) on Coburn's pairing, he could sit back and concentrate on defense, which he's good at, rather than making that outlet pass to the forwards, which he's very bad at. 

**TL;DR** Don't trade Coburn. He not that bad. Play him with Streit and we play well and win Cup.

* **FIRE LAVY:** His system worked for a while here and we got damn close to winning a cup in 2010. Although, I think that we need to switch to a defensive minded system. A strong defense wins cups. 

* **FIRE JEFF REESE:** Our goaltenders have been bad for a while and while I think that there is a curse in Philly with goaltenders, the problem can't all lie on the shoulders of our goaltenders. Take a look at Bobrovsky. He get's shipped out to Columbus, learns under a different goalie coach and comes out a Vezina candidate. He is standing up more in net and making himself look bigger which utilizes his large frame. I think it's obvious that Jeff Reese hasn't worked well with any goalie that we've had here. The blame for our horrid goaltending has to go from the coach down.

* **GET A PURE GOAL SCORING WINGER FOR GIROUX:** The Flyers need someone that can play on a line with Voracek and Giroux who can finish the beautiful passes that G dishes out. If we can get someone who can be a threat to score every time they're on the ice it will take some pressure off Giroux and he can play a looser game (which is, in my opinion, the issue he is having this year). Think Bobby Ryan.

* **GET A VETERAN STAY AT HOME DMAN:** Now this is an obvious one. We need a big body on defense who can make that good first pass and play responsible D. Think Mark Streit, Yandle, etc. Someone like Shattenkirk would work also. Get rid of Mez and Coburn to make room for someone who can teach Gus and the other young guns. Getting a vet will also help take some pressure and responsibility off Kimmo.

* **TRADE FOR BERNIER AT THE DRAFT AND AMNESTY BRYZ:** Bernier can be a cup winning goaltender. His numbers this year playing behind Quick are quite impressive. If we can land him this off season, that would give us the ability to buy out Bryz and use some of his contract for other pieces we need.

* **TRADE BRIERE AT THE DRAFT FOR A PICK/PROSPECTS:** Briere has been great for us during his time here. With that being said, I think his time here is done. Unlike Bryz, Briere still has some value to teams who need that one piece to make a deeper playoff push. Since he has value, it's unnecessary and counter productive to buy him out. Ask him where he is willing to move, have him waive his NMC, and get what you can get out of the trade.

* **ED SNIDER NEEDS TO STEP DOWN:** Lastly, Ed needs to go. His mentality on how to win a cup obviously will not work. His mind is too engraved with an archaic style of building a championship. We need fresh eyes and minds in this organization to start a new and get us a cup. 

These are the main issues that I believe need to be addressed sooner rather than later. There are some other things that could be done (Fire Holmgren, have the Phantoms and Flyers play the same style, hire some scouts that can spot defensive prospects, etc...) but one thing is for certain, something needs to be done. This is out of control. We're the Flyers god damnit! We deserve a cup!"	t5_2ribt	True

I am confident that moves will be made in the off season and before the trade deadline to make this team better next season, but through then I'm still a Flyer fan and damn proud of it. I don't care how much shit I get from Pens' fans.

The deal being made is beyond dirty, they're not giving potential local buyers much of a chance to save the team.

Long story short, for me and my fellow PEI Rocket/Islanders fans, can any fans that go to the Flyers games give Fleury some extra hell for us?

We have had our share of disappointments during their 10 years here on PEI, but it pisses us all off to see Fleury take our team away when the future was starting to look so bright for us.

Figured you guys would understand why I'm pissed off at a Penguin for making this dirty deal.

Thank you.

1373139879.0	1hrhr0	Regarding Anthony Stolarz...	infidelappel	47	6	36	"I've seen a ton of Flyers fans both here and in /r/hockey talking about how Stolarz will be our starter in a few years' time, how he should be in the AHL today (even though he can't as he's under 20), how he'll be NHL ready soon, etc.

Can we all please simmer down about this? Expectations on Stolarz are soaring to unrealistic levels all of the sudden.

Here's the reality: the kid went from struggling on an unremarkable college squad, barely earning any playing time, and got picked up to be the third-stringer on one of the best defensive teams in the entire CHL in London. The Knights have a handful of d-men who have been drafted and are coached by Dale Hunter, the man famous for getting the Caps to the ECF by having them lock down defensively and block everything. Not to mention their forward group is *pretty good.* They're consistently one of the best OHL clubs.

Stolarz got into a few games, put up numbers, and had himself a nice hot streak before struggling in the playoffs and - despite having good numbers - sort of lost his hold on the starter's job in the finals.

I'm not saying the kid won't ever make the NHL, but he's had one remarkable season statistically, playing on a team that benefited his bottom line quite a bit. He really hasn't demonstrated anything that should have people projecting him as a future NHL starter. There is a *very* long way to go before that can happen. 

We should be happy if he's knocking on the door as a backup in 4-5 years. If - and that is an *enormous* if - he ever gets higher than that, that'd just be icing on the cake. 

Just my two cents. The kid's got some potential and I don't mean to say he WON'T be our goalie of the future, but I feel like everyone's over hyping him based on a half season of good stats. Some measured optimism might not be a bad thing, here."	t5_2ribt	True

1358661794.0	16x21e	To the people who left today's game after the second intermission...	kid320	40	8	32	"As with most of the people who subscribe to this subreddit, I am a huge Flyers fan.  I'm not in a situation to afford season tickets, but I've been to EVERY Flyers home opener for more than ten years.

Today was a bit of a different story, as the perfect mixture of post-lockout-hockey-craving-fans, a Saturday matinee, the shine of Pierre McGuire's freshly polished head, and a game against the Flyers arch-rivals caused tickets to go quickly and any second-hand tickets to go for a price that was out of my $120 budget.

Even though I couldn't get a ticket, I still wanted to be a part of the excitement.  So, like many of you, I went to Xfinity Live to watch the game.  During the second intermission, I decided to run over to the box office and pick up my will-call tickets for the Penn State/Vermont hockey game.  On the way, I passed 50 to 100 people who were leaving the Flyers game.  There was still an entire period of hockey left to play, and people were LEAVING THE GAME.

I had come to terms with the fact that I didn't get a ticket merely because I didn't have enough money in the budget to cover a $150 ticket.  I accept the fact that it was a big game and tickets were in high demand, but when I saw the fans leaving after the second intermission, I felt sick to my stomach.

This post is not meant for anybody who is a true hockey fan.  This isn't even meant for the casual hockey fan (or a new hockey fan) who can appreciate a big game like this one and will actually go to the game and attempt to make some sense of it all.  But, to anybody who might read this and isn't truly a hockey fan - to anybody who just goes to the games to just say they were there and doesn't truly care about the game of hockey -  to anybody who thinks it is okay to leave a game that early - a game that would mean so much to a die hard hockey fan - you make me sick to my stomach.  You're inflating the price of tickets that might have otherwise been available to a true fan.  You're taking tickets out of the hands of the true fan.  If you want to go to a hockey game, that is fine.  If you want to leave before the third period even begins, who am I to stop you?  But PLEASE, do this during a game that isn't in such high demand.

To anybody who read this, thanks for allowing me a place to vent my frustration.  I guess the streak had to end at some point.  I'm just disappointed that it had to be so soon."	t5_2ribt	True

I'd just like to take a minute to thank /u/Splo for making me a mod there earlier this week. I'm honoured to take on the task. With College kicking me in the ass recently, my commitment to posting these threads was tested (thanks again to /u/keefer who did an amazing job in my absence and was always happy to help out), but expect a much bigger effort on my part with these threads and to the sub in general. ""Previous 5 Games"" and a ""Schedule"" have been added to the side bar, but I hope to add some more things as we go along. And, as always, Go Flyers!!

Back to today's game. Last night was a tough one to lose. Great start in the first period, then it all fell apart in the second. G hasn't responded well to the added pressure on him this season, but I expect him to shake it off sooner rather than later. 

Tonight, it's really important to salvage. Any win in Montreal on HNIC will be a huge confidence boost for the Flyers, and god knows, we need a turnaround, especially on the road. "	t5_2ribt	True

**Points of Interest:**

Just in case you didn't realise, HOCKEY IS BACK TODAY!! Claude Giroux will be your Captain for the day. Lavi and Chief will be behind the bench, and Homer will be upstairs with Ed. It's great to be back. 

With G now wearing a big C on his chest, expect a big season from him. B. Schenn I think is poised for a breakout year, being on G's wing. 

The other Schenn has been playing with Timonen all camp, so expect the two of them to be the top pair today. Luke is either going to be the best thing to have happened for our defence, being pretty much a clone of Pronger, minus the crazy, asshole-ish personality (which we all love, by the way). Keep an eye on him today. 

Bryz, again, will be a focus all season. You can't be a goalie in Philly without a lot of questions being asked of you. According to Bryz, he's figured out how to play in this City. I totally believe him, and if we can get the same results out of him that we did at the end of last season, he's worth every penny.

I want Jake to keep up the scoring, I'd like Giroux to make some pretty passes, and of course I want Coots to get some more ice time and prove why he was a top 10 draft pick. 

Maybe ignore the outcome, and look at bright spots. Of course this means covering your eyes every time Bruno Gervais is on the ice, but you get the point.

Plus from the entire leagues perspective, these are going to be some really good playoffs. There's a lot of great storylines to watch unfold this season still, and as a fan of the sport I'm going to love every minute of it.

#####It's an early one today. A very early one. Shake off the hangover, and lets get into some hockey.

##### Leighton is back in ADK, and Sestito was claimed by the Canucks this week, as each of them was put on waivers after coming back from injury. Sestito is a loss, as his energy and hitting was great last season, but we have a good one in Rinaldo. We can do without him.

#####The Flyers have been terrible in games where they could go to 0.500 in win percentage (0-7-0 I think is the record). Hopefully today, with the rest they got after that huge win against the Caps, they can break the trend against an injury ridden Senators team, but don't let the injuries fool you.

I just wanted to preview what the Flyers prospects will be doing and how they could affect the team this year and in the future.

I wanted to take an in depth look at what to expect from the teams top forwards prospects and what to expect from them this year.

Listed alphabetically.

**JASON** **AKESON**

After a strong rookie year Akeson had a very good sophomore season that started in the ECHL and ended with his first goal in the NHL. Two of the biggest knocks against Akeson coming out of juniors was his defense and his lack of willingness to shoot the puck. Akeson took major strides in both areas (his goals per game average nearly doubled from his first to second season in the AHL). Akeson has a shot to make the team at training camp if Simon Gagne isn't brought back and he will probably be the first player called up if there is an injury (unless it's a Hartnell or Simmonds).

*Expectations*

A good season would see Akeson average a point per game in the AHL. Top prospects like Gustav Nyquist (slightly older) and Ryan Spooner (slightly younger) have similar size and talent and average around PPG.

**NICK** **COUSINS**

Cousins was one of the top 10 forwards in the CHL last season. He didn't get the hype as a lot of other players did because of his arrest led to the OHL and Hockey Canada acting like he didn't exist. In his limited time in the AHL his point production hasn't translated, but that doesn't mean that it wont. Though he is being groomed for more of a depth role in the NHL if he puts up good numbers in the minors he could see that role expand.

*Expectations*

A good season for Cousins would see him scoring at the same rate as Akeson did in his rookie season (.72 PPG, .18 GPG) or possibly what Brad Marchand did in his rookie year (.747 PPG, .23 GPG). He could be put in a depth role with the Phantoms and we could see him below those averages; but if he is averaging around .4 PPG or less he could further out than the team expects.

**KYLE** **FLANAGAN**

Flanagan had an amazing year in the NCAA last season. He had the third highest PPG average behind Johnny Gaudreau and Erik Haula and they were playing on much better teams. Flanagan has also been consistent throughout his NCAA career, he had pretty much the same PPG average the year before, and never averaged less than .875 PPG in any NCAA season. He actually had a higher PPG average for his career than Matt Read had.

*Expectations*

Flanagan started his AHL career by getting 5 points in his first 5 games and ended last season with 7 points in 13 AHL games. For him to impact the Flyers future he will probably need to have a big season (he's only signed for one year). He could easily help other prospects like Petr Straka, Marcel Noebels, and/or Tye McGinn, but for him to make the leap to the Flyers he will need a Cory Conacher-esc season (slightly over a point per game).

**TYRELL** **GOULBOURNE**

Goulbourne was our controversial 3rd round pick this past season. Drafted to be a fighter and the heir apparent to Zac Rinaldo. In Rinaldo's draft eligible year he had 16 fights, while Goulbourne has 19. But Goulbourne could add something else. Goulbourne's PPG last season was less than .1 lower than Taylor Leier's in his draft year. His production was nearly double what Rinaldo's was in his draft eligible year. Goulbourne actually has a pretty good scoring touch.

*Expectations*

Leier took a major jump in his first post draft year, could Goulbourne make a similar jump? Maybe not, Leier was playing with a much better team in Portland. But if Goulbourne can increase his point and goal production it could bode very well for his future with the team.

**SCOTT** **LAUGTON**

Laughton had a good year in the OHL, but after his time spent with the Flyers after the Lockout ended he really took off. Watching Laughton at Prospect Camp this summer you can see that he has gotten much better over the last year. Most fans have seen his ceiling as being a 3rd or 4th liner in the NHL, but could Laughton's role be much bigger? He probably could make the Flyers this season, especially if Gagne doesn't re-sign, but I don't think that's the right move. Laughton could get a lot more developing offensively playing in Oshawa. Look at the teams that are great a developing talent, they don't bring players to the NHL when can play at that level, they bring them up when they can't gain anything from the level they are playing. Winnipeg rushed Alex Burmistrov and he struggled. He played a role, but it wasn't why he was drafted. They learned there lesson and left Mark Scheifele in juniors for two years.

*Expectations*

I think Laughton will play some with the Flyers this season. Laughton can play 9 games before he burns a year off his entry level contract. But I think he will get sent back to the OHL. If you look at his former teammate Boone Jenner progression in his second post draft year, Laughton's production could be between .662-1.267 GPG, 1.159-1.92 PPG. I think it would be more reasonable for him to average around .6 GPG and 1.5 PPG. If he could average 1.75 PPG in junior we know we have something special, elite prospects like Scheifele and Ryan Strome both scored around 1.75 points per game in the OHL in their second draft eligible year. 

**TAYLOR** **LEIER**

Leier took a big jump in his first post draft year. His point production nearly doubled and he was a valuable player on one of the best teams in the CHL. He's a grinder, good defensively, and if he continues to grow offensively he could be a real talent. It is still early, but there is a chance that Leier could develop into a Max Talbot type player.

*Expectations*

I expect Leier to get over the point per game hump. His line mates from last year, Chase De Leo and Oliver Bjorkstrand, will be older and better developed. He might play with Keegan Iverson who will likely be a first round pick in 2014 or he might play with Petan and Leipsic who both scored 120 points last season.

**TYE** **MCGINN**

McGinn had a rather pedestrian start to last season, but with a pretty decent showing with the Flyers and a strong return to the AHL McGinn has put himself on the map. His production, like all power forwards, will rely a lot on who he is playing with. If he's playing with better players and he has chemistry with them he could put up great numbers. McGinn still hasn't scored at the same clip as similar players like Zack Kassian. The biggest issue for McGinn is that the Flyers also have Marcel Noebels in the system, who is a very similar and better all around player.

*Expectations*

He needs to score a lot and probably have to put up somewhere around PPG to get back to the Flyers in a power forward role. One thing that McGinn could do is develop into a goon. It's not crazy, Tom Sestito was actually a much stronger offensive prospect than McGinn before turning himself into a fighter to stick in the league.

**MARCEL** **NOEBELS**

Noebels had a very strong season in the minors last season. 13 goals and 23 points in 43 games might not sound great, but it's more goals and points per game than McGinn had his rookie year, and Noebels is a year younger than McGinn was. Noebels is also a versatile player, he can play all three forward positions, and he is a strong defensive forward.

*Expectations*

If Noebels grows at the same rate McGinn did going from his rookie to sophomore seasons, than he would average between .41-.47 GPG and .6-.8 PPG. If Noebels could easily be called up this season and he might not have to wait for Hartnell or Simmonds to get hurt.

**MICHAEL** **RAFFL**

Raffl had a great season leading Leksand to the championship in the Allsvenskan, Sweden's second league (but still a strong league). He finished 5th in the league in points, first on his team, and his point totals weren't inflated by playing with Lockout players who flooded the Allsvenskan.

*Expectations*

Raffl will likely be playing with the Phantoms this season, but he still has a chance to make the Flyers out of camp. He has struggled when transferring leagues, so a sub par showing this year might be coming. If he clicks or benefits from playing with skilled line mates or playing sporadically in the NHL he could put up some serious numbers.

**PETR** **STRAKA**

Straka had a huge bounce back season last year in the QMJHL. He had 41 goals, 41 assists, and lead Baie-Comeau Drakkar to the QMJHL finals (they were the only team to win a single game against MacKinnon and Drouin's Halifax Mooseheads in the entire playoffs). Straka had a very impressive Prospect Camp as well. Straka has the quickest and most accurate shot of any prospect in the system. Straka is also the fastest prospect in the Flyers' system. He is not bad defensively but he is still pretty one dimensional. If he makes it to the NHL he will give the Flyers something they haven't had since Jeff Carter left, a guy who shoots **a** **lot**. Get it on his stick and he gets it on net. It's something the Flyers could definitely use.

*Expectations*

Straka could have a monster season in the AHL. With playmaking centers like Akeson, Flanagan, and Cousins, and power forwards like McGinn and Noebels to bang in rebounds Straka could put up a lot of points. But Straka is still a gamble. He could revert back to how he played in 10-11 and 11-12. It could be feast or it could be famine. I believe in his skill and I think he's a lot mentally tougher than he was a few years ago, so I'm going to say feast.

**Second** **Tier** **Players** **to** **Watch**

Cousins former teammate **Brandon** **Alderson** might have to spend some time in the ECHL, but if he sticks with Cousins and there chemistry transfers to the AHL he might be a steal. **Derek** **Mathers** is a fighter and former OHL captain who will be playing with the Phantoms. If he fights well he could take a job away from Jay Rosehill. **Michael** **Parks** I don't think is Flyers property anymore (he was drafted 3 seasons ago), but I do believe the Flyers will keep and eye on him. He's a grinder who showed a scoring touch (18 points in 22 games) at the end of his Freshman year but was riddled with injury last season. **Petr** **Placek** hasn't done much of anything at Harvard (3 points in 45 games over 2 seasons) but a guy like Harry Z only scored 5 points in 47 in his first two seasons and then was almost PPG in his last two years in the NCAA. **Eric** **Wellwood** is recovering from that horrific leg injury. If his speed returns he still may turn into a player who can contribute in the NHL, if it doesn't he may have played his last game in the NHL.

**Other** **Players**

**Kris** **Newbury**, the highest paid player in the AHL, is a small fighter who scores almost a point per game in the minors. He has played at least a few games in each of the last 7 seasons (including being played in favor of Brad Richards during the playoffs last year) so you can expect him to play at least a few games during the season. **Matt** **Mangene** and **Andrew** **Johnston** had decent rookie years but they don't inspire hope that they will be NHL regulars. **Guillaume** **Asselin** was signed to a minor league try out contract, he put up good numbers (better than point per game) in the QMJHL and he scored consistently, but there is probably a reason he's signed to a minor league tryout contract. Some of **Rob** **Bordson** stats inspire hope, his explosion during his junior league in college and his dominance at the ECHL level, but he has yet to put up significant numbers in the AHL. It's never good for a player to be named Captain of an AHL team. Mostly because it means you don't figure in the organizations plans at the NHL level. **Ben** **Holmstrom** was named the Phantoms captain in 11-12. Now he signed a contract that pays him $285,000 AHL salary (only $15,000 less than Kris Newbury). Sorry Ben, you're an AHLer. At least he's doing then **Tyler** **Brown**. After a lackluster rookie season he managed only 6 points in 55 games last year. He isn't great defensively and doesn't fight, this may be the end of the road for Brown.

Jeff Reese has been employed as a goaltenders coach since 2009. Since 2009, we've had these goaltenders:

Mike Leighton,
Ray Emery,
Brian Boucher,
Sergei Bobrovsky,
Ilya Bryzgalov,
Steve Mason. (Goaltenders that were brought up for under 5 games are not on this list.)

Stats this year:

* Mike Leighton (0-1, .808 SV%, 5.05 GAA, Playing for CBJ this year)
* Sergei Bobrovsky (19-11-6, .930 SV%, 2.06 GAA, Playing for CBJ this year)
* Ray Emery (16-1-0, .923 SV%, 1.91 GAA, Playing for CHI this year)
* Brian Boucher (0-2-0, .891 SV%, .891% SV%, 2.50 GAA, Playing for PHI this year)
* Ilya Bryzgalov (18-17-3, .898 SV%, 2.84 SV GAA, Playing for PHI this year)
* Steve Mason (3-6-1, .899 SV%, 2.95 GAA, Playing for CBJ)
* Steve Mason (2-2-0, .931 SV%, 2.09 GAA, Playing for PHI)

We have not held a goaltender for more than 2 years since Reese has been here. So, I don't know if goaltenders just ""Get Reese's teachings"" heading into the 3rd year? But, I think that he's just a terrible Goaltenders coach.

What are your opinions on Jeff Reese, fellow Flyers compadres? I don't know much about his teaching style, so I'd love to hear someone defend him."	t5_2ribt	True

***
Records
Flyers: 3-6-0 (Fifth in Atlantic Division, 14th in Eastern Conference)

Lightning: 6-2-0 (First in Southeast Division, second in Eastern Conference)
***
***Last meeting***

The Flyers didn’t fare well against the Lightning in their first meeting of this lockout-shortened season. Martin St. Louis registered four helpers and Teddy Purcell had a goal and two assists to help Tampa Bay light up Flyers backup Michael Leighton in a 5-1 victory on Jan. 27. Sniper Steven Stamkos also contributed a goal and an assist. Sean Couturier scored the Flyers’ lone goal.

The Bolts are 7-2-1 in their last 10 games against the orange and black.
***
***Previous games***

The Flyers scored three power-play goals and killed off five of six shorthanded situations to open their four-game homestand with a 5-3 win over the Carolina Hurricanes on Saturday. Claude Giroux and Danny Briere each had a goal and an assist while Kurtis Foster, Braydon Coburn and Mike Knuble each tallied their first goals of the season. Ilya Bryzgalov was solid in net once again, turning aside 39 shots for his third win this season.
***
Tampa Bay is coming off a 3-2 loss to New York Rangers. Stamkos scored both goals for the Lightning, who concluded their five-game homestand with a 4-1 record. Backup netminder Mathieu Garon made his second start of the season, making 27 saves in a losing effort.
***
***Feel the power***

After starting 5-for-40 on the power play over the first eight games of the season, the Flyers finally found some solid production on the man advantage against Carolina. They went 3-for-3 on Saturday and raised their PP effectiveness to 18.6 percent on the season.

The Lightning carry the best power play unit in the NHL into Tuesday’s contest. Tampa has gone 13-for-36 (36.1 percent) on the man advantage through its first eight games.
***
***In the cage***

Bryzgalov has faced the Lightning seven times in his career, going 3-3-0-1 in the process with a 2.80 goals against average and .869 save percentage. Leighton started the Flyers’ first matchup with Tampa earlier this season.

In his career, Lightning starter Anders Lindback has appeared in three games against the Flyers – one with the Bolts. He has a 1-2 record with a 2.36 goals against average and .914 save percentage in those contests. He made 24 saves and allowed just one goal in Tampa’s 5-1 win over the Flyers on Jan. 27.
***
***Did you know?***

Before his second-period marker on Saturday, Knuble’s last regular-season goal as a Flyer came on April 11, 2009. The 40-year-old, who is in his second stint in orange and black, has a goal and an assist in five games with the Flyers this season.
***
***Injuries***

Flyers: Simmonds is listed as day-to-day with a concussion and will not dress on Tuesday.

Scott Hartnell (left foot) and Andrej Meszaros (left shoulder) are on Injured Reserve and remain sidelined.

Lightning: Captain Vinny Lecavalier was hit in the left ankle by a hard Sami Salo shot in Saturday’s loss to the Rangers. He sat out Monday’s practice, but told the Tampa Bay Times he would be in the lineup against the Flyers.

Brendan Mikkelson is listed as questionable for Tuesday’s game with an upper-body injury. Mattias Ohlund (left knee surgery) and Matt Taormina (undisclosed) are on Injured Reserve and remain out indefinitely."	t5_2ribt	True

I normally don't do this, but this game was a crazy game between two awesome teams (as much as it pains me to say that), but there is unbelievable talent on both sides. I was pulling my hair out, screaming, and jumping around watching the game, as probably most of you were. You know it's a an amazing hockey spectacle when you have NO FREAKIN CLUE when/where the next goal is going to come from. So again, we got this one, but you guys battle ferociously and I was on the edge of my seat. Til the next time guys. Also, as always, GO PENS.	t5_2ribt	True
