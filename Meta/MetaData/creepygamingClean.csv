1351037742.0	11z74n	Something just happened in Halo 1. Would like advice on what to do next.	Distioned	219	24	42	"Hey, /r/creepygaming. I just went through a creepy game experience a few hours ago. I haven’t played many horror games, and I found this when searching through subreddits, so this is all new to me.

I recently built a new pc. It wasn’t exactly powerful, as I wanted to spend as little money as possible on it. It was good enough to run source engine games like TF2, but nothing like BF3 or Crysis. I was strictly looking for the cheapest way into PC gaming. Looking for a bit of nostalgia before I began playing some Team Fortress, I popped in my Halo CE into the disc tray and installed it. I have some fond memories playing with my group of friends and wanted to relive a bit of my past.

I instantly started to have problems installing it. Aside from all of the minor compatibility issues this game has with windows 7, I didn’t have my cd key. Well technically I still have it, but the game’s cd key was tied to some other pc that was long gone. I was fed up with that, so I just booted up another game, slightly frustrated that I wasted about an hour of my life on that thing.

It didn’t take long for me to start looking for workarounds so I could play.. I eventually found a keygen, and the game started to install. I picked the name I used years ago, Distioned, and hopped into the multiplayer lobby. I just picked a random game of CTF, and joined to see if everything worked. It didn’t. A pop up appeared and said the server’s client needed to be updated. the error messages got weirder and weirder.  I should have taken a screenshot of some of them. Some of them were almost laughable. Random selections of words would replace the error messages. Completely random.
 
It seemed no one else online had this problem. The ones that did were told to try updating their game. This information was no use to me because I updated when I first booted it up.

 However, I still wanted to play. It didn’t really matter if no one could join my gimpy out of date server.. So I went and created an internet game. Before this, I started up fraps to capture any weird error messages.. I chose CTF on Bloodgulch. The game started to load

Now some of you guys that have played Halo extensively know that there are certain points on any given map you can glitch up to so people can’t find you. These points require that you utilize glitches like pushing yourself through a wall with a vehicle. But there was always one I couldn’t get to. It took such crucial mouse movements and careful precision to even make it to the first step. Since I had nothing better to do in an empty server, I reattempted the glitch.

So I got myself into a ghost, and made my way over to the middle-ish part of the map.  I lined myself up against the pillar, and began trying to nudge myself into the wall. If you hurl yourself towards it too slowly, you’ll just be knocked off to the side. If you do it too quickly, you will just plain knock yourself through the wall, into the abyss. Getting in between there is where I’m trying to get. A few tries later, and I’m in. that was the easy part. The next few parts are hard to explain in text. I had to kinda shimmy across the wall until I start to get pushed off by something invisible. I now have to jump on that invisible thing without sliding off. It’s cake from there. a few tries later, and I had it. The vantage point this glitch had on the center of the map made it rightfully so for it to be the hardest to achieve.

My victory was cut short when my spartan drops dead. What the crap. I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised. Maybe I was out of bounds for too long? I couldn’t think about this for too long until I started dying randomly even more. I started to get creeped out. The text just said “Distioned died” I’ve never seen a pop up like this in Halo before.

I went down into my base just to make sure nothing was hitting me. I sat there for what seemed like minutes. I was observing everything. I leaned forward so my face was almost touching the monitor. my screen went blank for a second. I didn’t have any time to notice what was going on when I heard this horrible screeching noise. I reacted by knocking my headphones onto the keyboard. Everything was dark. Dark to the point where I could barely make out anything. Then a player joined.

The player who just joined my seemingly impossible to join server, was named juliet. I was thinking this must’ve been the person who was making me drop dead. it also must have been her who made that horrible sound. It seemed impossible for her to control my spartan’s life. Or even emit noises that aren’t in the game. I wanted to see if I could go shoot at her so I took off to the blue base. I was thinking maybe this was all a coincidence and a couple other players will join and this will just be a normal game of CTF.

The outward appearance of the blue base seemed normal, but inside was something disturbing. On the left wall in the back, there were words which I made out to be “find me”I was just about to exit right out of the game, But I was stopped in my tracks when a text appeared on my screen. I nearly forgot you could chat in this game. 
juliet: =]
Distioned: who are you?
juliet: lets play hide and seek =]

 After I dropped dead once again, I quit and shut down my server. I didn’t want to hear whatever she had to say next. And frankly, I was kinda creeped out by the whole situation. I honestly don’t know if this is a normal occurrence. Maybe the community has been overrun with hackers and this happens all the time.

Anyway, here’s the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV1WmIZVFlI

If you guys have any advice for what to do next I’d appreciate it. I’m off to bed for now.

the download is in a self extracting 7z .exe file. Once you open it, all the games are organized by folder. all the .rar's have already been extracted. Some require you to install the game, but most can be run outright as soon as you have the initial file extracted. 

All games were freeware titles, no piracy here. Hope you all enjoy.

I'm flying between roof tops trying to get to my next objective and what not, when I spot a person standing on a building close to a ledge. Now by this time I'm use to finding two or more people on a roof top but I've never seen any of them stand on a the ledge before. 

So I get closer to make sure I'm actually looking at a person and not a pole. Sure enough it's a person. Suddenly he lift his arms up and I wonder 'What the hell?' Then it hits me. He's about to commit suicide. I stand there motionless as I watch him teeter over the ledge and disappear. I look down from where he once stood and see his body lying in the street overrun with infected......

No where else in the game does this happen. Just right in this one spot that I happened to come across. This person has no meaning to the story what so ever and right now im still contemplating as to why the developers would want to put something like that in there.

So what are some moments that had you a little uneasy afterwards?

Woodsalt_	161	27	180	"Ok, so for those who don't know, Journey is a beautiful and amazing game where. If you seriously don't know much about the game, watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKqeD7ojynw) first.

Anyway, this happened last night, so I'm sure you can imagine I was up for a while trying to work out what the fuck was going on.

Well I was happily playing through the opening section with no troubles, my scarf was growing nicely and I was bounding about doing my thing. Anyway, I moved onto the next stage, the one where you have to build the cloth bridge by freeing the little cloth guys?

I was bobbing around here and I saw another guy in the distance. Now for those of you who haven't played this online, the multiplayer in this is kinda cool; you never know who it is, and a name doesn't come up until the end of the game. You only ever have one person with you at a time so it's quite an intimate experience.

The guy wasn't really moving, he was AFK in the distance so I just kinda ignored him initially and did my own thing, getting the glyphs and building my scarf longer but I did notice he had the white gown you get from when you get all the glyphs in one playthrough, so I assumed he must know his way around and wouldn't really care if I did what I want.

Anyway, I built the bridge and did my little surf thing across it and somehow he was waiting for me at the top, and I swear to God he never moved, he was just there. I'm not sure if his scarf was long enough to just kinda jump, and I would have assumed that if it didn't continue down this weird path.

I literally NEVER saw him walk or jump, he would drop out of the screen for a second when I turned around and then he'd be gone when I turn back, and he'd be waiting for me up ahead, just looking at me. This carried on for ages. A couple of times I'd refuse to look away and walk up to him, but when I did, he wouldn't move, he'd just stay there.

I did notice something pretty glitchy about him though, my scarf wouldn't 'recharge' and whenever I tried to do the big sing, the little pip would come out from when you're freezing on the mountain, still, weirder things have happened, that was until I did the big slide level.

Obviously he didn't walk or jump so you can safely assume he didn't slide. Up until this point I figured that he could just be moving really fast when I look away, like he's done this before, but there is no way he could do this without some other control.

As I slid down, he would appear on walkways up above, G-Man style, just watching as I went past. The bit that made me jump the most is the part where you're sliding past the pillars (there's a clip of it in the review) where he popped up between two of the pillars.

So I was freaked, fair to say but it stopped for a while. I figured he had left the game or something, on his way to torment another unsuspecting gamer, so I carried on to the underground part with the big flying rock snake thing where he was stood, right in the middle of the room as the snake scanned around.

It was weird, after the torment, I had a strange urge to watch him get chomped up, but the searchlight didn't pick him up at all, they went over him but it was like he wasn't there, so I soldiered on and got past the snake and noticed he wasn't around again, but I was skeptical, and rightly so, after the last time he had 'left'.

So on the bit where you slide down away from the monsters and they get blasted by light? Well I saw where the light came from this time. He was waiting for me at the bottom of the slope as I slid down, and the blast came from him, throwing the monsters off and then the game froze solid with some jarring buzzing audio like a disc getting grinded.

So yeah, I figured that would be as good a time as any to stop playing, so I had to pull the plug, the PS3 wasn't responding to the controller, and I was a little more freaked than I should have been getting closer to the TV to switch it off with the guy there.

Anyway, I did, and I lay back in my bed to watch Netflix when Netflix wouldn't connect, so I went downstairs to reboot the router. The internet went down, cutting the guy off so it crashed, makes sense, kind of anyway, except for the fact my housemate told me; ""No use, the internet's been fucked for the last 2, 3 hours, I've been trying to play Fifa"".

What the fuck. I wasn't even online.

Well this morning the internet IS working (obviously) and I can't bring myself to look at the PS3 because that is FUCKED UP.

So please tell me this is some glitch or explain it.


*UPDATE*

Ok, so I just logged on to find 20 or so messages like this: http://i.imgur.com/JgKPBVi.jpg?1

What the actual fuck.


*UPDATE*

So I managed to get on and he was there again. My game is sat paused as I try to upload 3 pictures I got. They were all corrupted but I managed to get this one after a few hours of fucking about. I imagine the other two will work this way too.

Sorry for the shitty images, I only have MS paint. My housemate is pretty decent with Photoshop, I'll see what he can do, but I figured you would want actual photographs with timestamps.

*UPDATE*

I came back to this after finding all of my games deleted aside from Journey. I have no idea what the fuck it means but I'm pretty pissed off.

*UPDATE*

Ok, they have access to my phone.

I prop my iPhone up against my TV stand so when I'm gaming or whatever, I can see when a text pops up (I like to crank it up so I don't really hear my phone too often).

Well I got another message, this time completely blank, aside from an attachment.

http://imgur.com/JPxwiV5

It's me, about the time I was looking at the messages, with my fucking eyes scratched out.

I think I might have to play this son of a bitch.


*UPDATE*

So I tried to take a video. It didn't work, like at all. The audio of the game is fucked, for a starter. This is what the opening theme SHOULD sound like:

1362220219.0	19in1q	I had my OoT cartridge glitched as a kid, been playing it for 10 years.	WizardHatchet	140	22	37	"When I was a kid I would play the hell out of Ocarina of Time. I would run home from school and spend the one hour I was allowed to collect rupees, explore Hyrule, fight monsters, etc.

One day my mom and my dad were fighting. When my dad was mad at my mom, he would go off on everyone. My mom eventually hid in her room. My dad then would normally go to us kids and start yelling at us for whatever reason, usually for a messy room. But if we were playing video games, he'd get especially mad at us for that and then probably throw them around or throw other shit around. 

One time my dad got mad at me and ripped out my OoT cartridge and threw it at the ground. He pulled as it was saving, after I defeated Gohma in a new game.  It was heavily glitched after that. Was neat for a bit as I felt like I was exploring a part of OoT nobody else would ever experience, but then it sucked after I realized that I could probably never beat it.

I’ve been trying to beat it for 10 years.

One obvious difficulty is that you cannot save the game, or respawn. More specifically there is a single save file called “hero” which cannot be written over. It only appeared after my dad broke it, so presumably it is a beta feature glitched in. If I save and reload then I end up trapped in the room I start in (eg. Link’s house). Running out the door just causes link to disappear and shows an empty room.

It’s been a long time so I don’t fully remember the original game, but the atmosphere in this glitched version is much worst. There is no music, just occasional background static. The sky texture (and many other 2d sprites such as the Zelda logo) disappeared, so the sky is always black. Nearly all the text is glitched. The textures on character faces are OK until they change their expression (such as when Zelda smiles) which causes their face sprites to go crazy.

A lot of the characters are missing. The ones left don’t have idle animations, so they tend to stare straight ahead. Most of the water and trees are gone.

Many of the songs are useless. Epona’s song just causes the horse to ride straight pass me into the horizon. Teleport songs trap you various places. The Sun Song simply freezes the game.
In addition to all the minor glitches which make progress through every dungeon room take at least an hour, there are two things which really give me a hard time.

First is Gohma’s eye. They are no longer confined to the Deku Tree boss room. They randomly show up in every area I’ve looked in. This makes using first person (for hookshot/bow/etc) extremely risky. If you look at an eye in first-person you are teleported back to Gohma’s room, turned back into a child, and forced to replay the fight, which is followed by the game crashing. This can happen sometimes by simply allowing an eye to reach the middle of the screen even when using the third person camera. I’ve learnt to avoid this by regularly using the Z button to center the camera away from any eyes. But there is always a small chance of getting unlucky during a cutscene.

Second problem is that wallmasters tend to appear in random places. You can’t stand still for long anywhere. Getting caught means being dropped back into Link’s house, trapped as before, and always as a child. When I was a kid I would bash reset as soon as a wallmaster grabbed me, before the scream sound played. These days I usually hang out at Link’s house for a while before turning off the N64, it’s a nice moment to reflect on your mistakes even if there is no escaping. Knowing that the game is over can be quite comforting. You can only stay there for about 20 minutes because multiple wallmasters appear in the house eventually, this causes a lot screaming inside the house, which bothers me even as an adult. So I still use a timer to make sure I turn it off after 19 minutes.

For those interested, my parents are dead now. But I live in the same house, the N64 with OoT is still hooked up, next to the same furniture my dad broke as a kid. I give it a go at least once a week.

Anyone else experience a glitched cartridge?

1338166306.0	u7zs3	A weird creepy moment I had with Red Dead Redemption yesterday.	jimothyjim	120	16	28	"Disclaimer: This isn't ""scare your pants off"" creepy but it was a bit
unnerving at the time. I'm also a bit of a rambler when it comes to
writing so it might be a bit lengthy.

I'm not that far into the game yet, so this was my first trip to
Thieves Landing and it's here where things became a bit strange. I'd
just done a stranger mission (not a particularly important one but
I'll avoid spoiler details anyway) and I was pretty tired in real life
so I decided it was time to save and call it a night.

I got on my horse, and started to ride to the rent-able room when I
knocked some randomner off his feet. Unfortunately this is a frequent
occurrence for me so I knew he was gonna start shooting at me once he
got back up. I don't like to kill civilians because it kills the
immersion for me, so I decided to ride out of town a little way so
he'd hopefully calm down and I wouldn't have to kill him just to save
my game. I rode just far enough for the buildings to exit my view,
then turned right around and headed back for the room. It must have
been about 11pm or 12am game-time at this point so it was obviously
pretty dark. As I re-entered the area I found it surprisingly easy to
weave my way trough the people and reach the target building, but I
didn't think too much of it at the time.

Following my dismount of the horse, I saw one of the whores standing
completely motionless in the middle of the bridge at the edge of the
area. I thought I must have missed her saying something important, and
that she was just waiting for me to come on over so a random mission
could start. Believing in my theory I walked right up to her and she
doesn't move, and nothing happens. She says some generic whore
dialogue that they all say but it' was completely non specific and
it's definitely not an errand she wanted to be ran. ""What's up with
this?"" I thought, so I did what every real gamer would do and ran
directly into her, thus pushing her across the bridge. The idea was
that she'd get knocked out of this weird lock and her AI would take
control, call me clumsy and then she'd go back to whoring around.

The momentum of the push meant I was now directly behind her so I
turned around to face back towards her. She hadn't even turned around,
she was just stood motionless in the new sport I'd knocked her into,
staring blankly into the distance. Now facing directly back into the
residential area, it was then that I first realised that the entire
town was stood completely motionless. They were all saying generic NPC
stuff, but not a single one was walking around. They didn't even seem
to be doing the normal wall lean animations or anything, all of them
just motionlessly staring in random directions. Two particularly odd
guys were sitting on horses to the side of the bridge, just out of the
water and in an area of plants. I don't know why they were there. I've
never seen an NPC riding a horse off of the normal track, so I
seriously doubt they'd gained entry via the river with the bridge
literally right beside them.

I stood there looking at them for about 30 seconds, listening to the
town run through it's dialogue, waiting for someone somewhere to move
just an inch. They didn't. I knew it was just a game glitch or
whatever, but it was a really eerie feeling just walking around a
living dead town. I really was pretty tired in real life though, so I
shook it off and started walking back towards the purchasable property
to save. Just as I rounded the side of that house, one person started
walking behind me. Naturally I turned around thinking ""oh good,
everyone's back to normal"", but nope, just that one guy. I started
heading back towards him and as I did so he turned around and started
walking away, almost as if he was following me but didn't want me to
think he was.

I wish this story had a better punchline, like the game crashed and
his head started flashing on my screen shouting ""All hail Satan!!"" but
unfortunately what really happened is I bought the property and went
to sleep both in-game and in real life. It was, however, a very
surreal scene that I thought you might enjoy hearing about, and I
haven't actually played since then so who knows? Maybe next time I'll
start the game and he'll be looking over my bed as I load it up, with
the town members lifelessly staring over his shoulder. Probably not
though."	t5_2tv55	True

And as I gazed mournfully at sun, something in my neck snapped.

1361475176.0	18yz4g	A creepy experience I had when making a Doom2 level	fruitcakefriday	93	11	15	"*Foreword* This is quite a personal experience as it is part of my history as a level designer. It's kinda lengthy, but I hope it's worth the read for you all.

Back in 1995 I was entering my teen years and harbouring an (un)healthy addiction to Doom and the DEU editing kit. I loved making levels for multiplayer to play with my friends, and had a go at making some SP levels too. 

There was one SP level I made (which made its way onto a PC Gamer UK cover CD I'm happy to say) where I really wanted to push the ambience of the game and offer something a bit fresh in the Doom engine.

I was making a small outdoor map set in the early hours of the morning; low light level, lots of those dead broken trees, demonic symbols engraved into the marble walls of a temple like building within a dire forest glade...the usual Doom stuff. I wanted ambient sounds in the level; hooting owls, quiet lonely winds, rustling leaves. However, the Doom engine didn't support anything of the sort...so I improvised. 

I took 3 or 4 of the enemy types in the game and changed their idle sounds - which play everywhere - to the ambient effects I wanted. Then I used the Doom2 Boss to spawn them into a room the player never got into, and made that room a giant crusher, so the monsters would die after a while, thus mixing up the frequency of the different ambient sounds. It worked very well; the monsters would spawn, hoot and rustle a bit, then die a few moments later. The only hint that there was anything odd going on in the level was the demonic chant the Boss says when it 'sees' you, which I left in because it sounded cool and gave a good opening to the level. Other than that I had an OK single player level with some novel ambient sound effects; very rare for a Doom2 level!

There was however another odd thing that happened, only when playing in Nightmare skill, the most difficult in the game, and this thing is one of the most chilling experiences I've had in a video game.

I was testing some new lighting levels in the map, spawning in the rusty monolith like start room and getting through the first small garden area with the marble temple, got the key to pass through a gate that led to a large open area filled with those dead Doom2 trees; plenty of low level monsters like zombie soldiers, imps, cacodemons and pinkys. This was to be the first map of many, so I kept my monsters small, and some were in use by the ambient sound system. I fought my way into the graveyard in the centre of this sparse forest, and climbed the marble steps at the end to the great tomb and got the next key to the exit door, and triumphed against the hoards of super-fast pinkys that emerged from a room at the back of the glade upon picking up the key and rocket launcher.

It was tough; in Nightmare mode enemies are twice as fast, but I cleared the area. I was turning to head back to the start area where the exit is, weaving between the trees and demon corpses in the gloom, when I started to hear the distant servo legs of the Arachnotron - one of my ambient sound monsters - faintly on the edge of hearing, but getting closer. These things are spawned miles away in my closed-off room, yet I was hearing one approach. Fear gripped me. This was Wrong. I made the level and I knew exactly the inner workings of it - there was no possible way for the monsters in my ambient room to escape and get into the play space...yet I was clearly hearing the mechanical whir of legs twitching movement, now followed by another, from a different direction. I was terrified. I tentatively continued on my path to the exit, but no sooner had I reached the pass with the gate previously opened that a Revenant - my hooting owl - *walked out from the wall ahead* and ambled toward me in the grey light. Oh fuck.

Having reached its prey through an impossible escape from my ambient room, and a 10 minute long trek across the nothingness of space inbetween it and my play area, it had found me, and now fired its homing missiles in my direction. The Arachnotron's leg sounds were now deafening, and as I ran back into the trees from the skeleton's missile, two of these mechanical brain-spiders entered through the walls from different directions...I was being hunted! By my ambient sound monsters! At this point I had worked on the level for so long, I had almost forgotten they existed, and took them for granted, but now they had found a way to settle the score after being locked in that room and crushed over and over again.

So after recovering from my initial shock, I readied my rocket launcher and set to mopping things up...except that didn't work. Nothing worked. My missiles went straight through them. My bullets hit nothing but trees and rooty walls. I cheated and gave myself a BFG, to no avail. I was out of options, and at this point pushed into the back of my level in the farthest point from the exit, and these hellish hooting wind monsters continued to appear through the walls; there must have been 4 revenants, 6 arachnatrons, and an arch-vile stalking in the distance...I honestly felt like crying, this was so wrong.

I didn't make it to the exit. I died, though made it to the start area. The monsters were still appearing, of all sorts now, as I had no control over the monster types spawned by the Boss. The crusher I had made also served another function; to kill the weaker enemies quickly so their unchanged idle grunts could not be heard, leaving only the stronger enemies with their modified sounds. They didn't appear in my level at first, but before I died Imps, Cacodemons and Mancubi were emerging through the walls, and not even being bothered by walls *inside* the level. It was hell.

I still don't know the details of this 'bug', only that it happened in Nightmare mode alone. Technical explanations aside, I could also not help but feel they were ghosts of a tortured lot, doomed to squeal and die in my kill-room, that had found a way to break free, and come after me to my grave.

[edit] I am writing this from memory, and it happened 18 years ago, and I have never told the experience in such depth before. I may have gotten some of the specific details of the map wrong, and took some creative license in my story, but the meat of the story is 100% true as well as my reactions. The level still exists wherever that PC Gamer CD does, along with a bunch of my other levels."	t5_2tv55	True

1374115847.0	1ij7gr	Pale Luna	SHITTY_GIMMICK_ANUS	83	14	6	"In the last decade and a half it's become infinitely easier to obtain exactly what you're looking for, by way of a couple of keystrokes. The Internet has made it all too simple to use a computer to change reality. An abundance of information is merely a search engine away, to the point where it's hard to imagine life as any different. 

Yet, a generation ago, when the words 'streaming' and 'torrent' were meaningless save for conversations about water, people met face-to-face to conduct software swap parties, trading games and applications on Sharpie-labeled five-and-a-quarter inch floppies. 

Of course, most of the time the meets were a way for frugal, community-minded individuals to trade popular games like King's Quest and Maniac Mansion amongst themselves. However, a few early programming talents designed their own computer games to share amongst their circle of acquaintances, who in turn would pass it on, until, if fun and well-designed enough, an independently-developed game had its place in the collection of aficionados across the country. Think of it as the 80's equivalent of a viral video. 

Pale Luna, on the other hand, was never circulated outside of the San Fransisco Bay Area. All known copies have been long disposed of, all computers that have ever run the game now detritus buried under layers of filth and polystyrene. This fact is attributed to a number of rather abstruse design choices made by its programmer. 

Pale Luna was a text adventure in the vein of Zork and The Lurking Horror, at a time when said genre was swiftly going out of fashion. Upon booting the program, the player was presented with a screen almost completely blank, except for the text: 

-You are in a dark room. Moonlight shines through the window. 

-There is GOLD in the corner, along with a SHOVEL and a ROPE. 

-There is a DOOR to the EAST. 

-Command? 

So began the game that one writer for a long-out-of-print fanzine decried as ""enigmatic, nonsensical, and completely unplayable"". As the only commands that the game would accept were PICK UP GOLD, PICK UP SHOVEL, PICK UP ROPE, OPEN DOOR, and GO EAST, the player was soon presented with the following: 

-Reap your reward. 

-PALE LUNA SMILES AT YOU. 

-You are in a forest.There are paths to the NORTH, WEST, and EAST. 

-Command? 

What quickly infuriated the few who've played the game was the confusing and buggy nature of the second screen onward — only one of the directional decisions would be the correct one. For example, on this occasion, a command to go in a direction other than NORTH would lead to the system freezing, requiring the operator to hard reboot the entire computer. 

Further, any subsequent screens seemed to merely repeat the above text, with the difference being only the directions available. Worse still, the standard text adventure commands appeared to be useless: The only accepted non-movement-related prompts were USE GOLD, which caused the game to display the message: 

-Not here. 

USE SHOVEL, which brought up: 

-Not now. 

And USE ROPE, which prompted the text: 

-You've already used this. 

Most who played the game progressed a couple of screens into it before becoming fed-up by having to constantly reboot and tossing the disk in disgust, writing off the experience as a shoddily programmed farce. However, there is one thing about the world of computers that remains true, no matter the era: some people who use them have way too much time on their hands. 

A young man by the name of Michael Nevins decided to see if there was more to Pale Luna than what met the eye. Five hours and thirty-three screens worth of trial-and-error and unplugged computer cords later, he finally managed to make the game display different text. The text in this new area read: 

-PALE LUNA SMILES WIDE 

-There are no paths 

-PALE LUNA SMILES WIDE 

-The ground is soft 

-PALE LUNA SMILES WIDE 

-Here 

-Command? 

It was another hour still before Nevins stumbled upon the proper combination of phrases to make the game progress any further; DIG HOLE, DROP GOLD, then FILL HOLE. This caused the screen to display: 

-Congratulations 

—— 40.24248 —— 

—— -121.4434 —— 

Upon which the game ceased to accept commands, requiring the user to reboot one last time. 

After some deliberation, Nevins came to the conclusion that the numbers referred to lines of latitude and longitude — the coordinates lead to a point in the sprawling forest that dominated the nearby Lassen Volcanic Park. As he possessed much more free time than sense, Nevins vowed to see Pale Luna through to its ending. 

The next day, armed with a map, a compass, and a shovel, he navigated the park's trails, noting with amusement how each turn he made corresponded roughly to those that he took in-game. Though he initially regretted bringing the cumbersome digging tool on a mere hunch, the path's similarity all but confirmed his suspicions that the journey would end with him face-to-face with an eccentric's buried treasure. 

Out of breath after a tricky struggle to the coordinates, he was pleasantly surprised by a literal stumble upon a patch of uneven dirt. Shoveling as excitedly as he was, it would be an understatement to say that he was taken aback when his heavy strokes unearthed the badly-decomposing head of a blonde-haired little girl. 

Nevins promptly reported the situation to the authorities. The girl was identified as Karen Paulsen, 11, reported as missing to the San Diego Police Department a year and a half prior. 

Efforts were made to track down the programmer of Pale Luna, but the nearly-anonymous legal gray area in which the software swapping community operated inescapably led to many dead ends. 

Collectors have been known to offer upwards of six figures for an authentic copy of the game. 

The rest of Karen's body was never found

I was attempting to wrangle me a unicorn, because every guy needs to ride a unicorn. I was riding the war horse at the time and I was in some far south part of Mexico. I finally caught the freaking bastard and I roped it in and began to ride it to tame it, my horse wandered off. I got on the unicorn and decided from some sick morbid part of me, I should shoot it in the head. I can't remember if it took one or more shots, but it died. It fell to the ground and did the glitchy flying thing away. I called for my horse, War horse, (of the apocalypse btw) nothing happened... I called again, nothing. I thought, ""fuck, I gotta walk all the way back to a town???"" So, I began walking, and as a Director, I find fun in making dramatic scenes in games. I angled the camera and walked like a badass towards a town. I hear the zombie sounds from the game and I turn around with my revolver to see nothing... I'm suspicious at this point. So, I continue walking, same thing it makes a noise. I do a 360 to see nothing in my field of view. This goes on for a min or so, finally I decide to shoot off a bunch of rounds to see if it was an audio glitch and have the other sound mask over it and fix the glitch... idk, it may have worked! Anyway, it didn't so I turn around whistle again for my horse, and I see the horse icon on my map, I go towards it, and no horse is there. I turn around and ""ahh shit-fuck!""  there is the zombie, and it began to attack the shit out of me, un-able to die. I died... True story, sounds fake but I didn't play for a while."	t5_2tv55	True

I was on this quest where you have to protect a water caravan and investigate where the people who have raided other caravans are coming from. If you are not familiar with the game, this quest requires you to search for the caravan, as it is already making its way to spread aqua pura throughout the wasteland. 


I was following the compass and I arrived at the destination under a bridge only to find dead raiders(mercs? I don't remember much of this mission), a dead trader, and dead caravan bodyguards. I was disappointed in myself that I hadn't arrived in time to save them, but then I noticed something strange. The compass had changed locations and it kept moving, almost as if the bodyguards/brahmin/trader were all still alive. 


The marker moved into the water. Puzzled, I swam into the water and found nothing there. I instantly remembered the bridge and made my way up there. I could see figures on the bridge and, what do you know, there they were. They were simply standing there, staring at me.


I would move and they would ALL shift their attention towards me. I tried to talk to them but got blank stares. I ran up to one of the guards only to find myself run right through him. I tried shooting him and the bullets went right through him. Same thing happened when I tried it on everyone else. I got real freaked out, pulled out my fatman, and shot myself into the ionosphere. I did the quest again and had no problems, but it was one of the creepiest glitches that I've ever experienced."	t5_2tv55	True
1351137338.0	121r5r	Update on my exploits in Halo 1.	Distioned	77	15	23	"[Previous thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepygaming/comments/11z74n/something_just_happened_in_halo_1_would_like/)


Hey guys, thanks for leaving all the messages and advice. I was originally intending to update and figure out my game plan right as I woke up, but I completely forgot my friends and I planned a little hiking excursion. And in case anyone cares, it was awesome. I jumped into a lake.


So the gist of my plan is to play hide and seek with her and see where this takes me. I honestly don’t know how I didn’t make the connection between “find me” and her saying “lets play hide and seek”. But here’s the problem. This was probably just some one time thing. A random occurrence. Although I’m giving myself the benefit of the doubt, I don’t think she will ever come back. I’m still going to play though. Same setup and everything. It probably gives me the best chance of “summoning” juliet again.

And with all that out of the way, I don’t think I have much else to say. Nothing much has happened since I quit out of the game. I mentioned that I had something creepy happen on my game during the trip. They seemed to find this hilarious and was their main source of ridiculing me, saying things like “Oh, should we pack it up early? I don’t want to keep you from performing an exorcism on your game disc”

I’m going to play again as soon as possible. So expect another update tomorrow. I think I’m going to split my updates into different threads so I don’t risk hitting the character limit. But I also don’t want to be spamming your board. So what do you guys think? Paste ‘em all together or split em up?

UPDATE:

I didn’t sleep last night.  I was too excited to play. No, excited isn’t the word. I was anxious to play. I wanted to get this out of the way so I could move on with my life. All I needed to do was just see if she would join again and play hide and seek. So why not pull the band aid and play so I can rest easy tomorrow?

Well I did just that. I started up Halo and created a LAN server instead of an internet server. This time I’d know if some weird crap was really going on. I hit start server and the map started to load up. Well the first thing I noticed was I could actually see again. Everything looked normal enough. This wasn’t nearly as scary as I remember it being. 

I decided to give myself a 10 minute time limit to wait before I tried switching it to an internet game or just calling it a night. All I could do was fill the time by aimlessly wandering around bloodgulch. This obviously got boring after 3 - 4 minutes. I started calling out to her.

Distioned: hey juliet? getting tired here..

Distioned: What am I supposed to do?

That seemed to do it. juliet joined. A strange mixture of fear and confusion came over me because I thought I had everything figured out. I thought that she was just a random player who was screwing with me. But now, it looks as if she was waiting for me. and on top of all that, I was playing on a LAN game. I didn’t believe what I was seeing. Am I now supposed to believe she is some sort of magical technological ghost that transcends space and time? I don’t know what I believe anymore.

juliet: do you want to play now?

Distioned: Yeah

My game froze and everything went dark again. But this time There was a noise. It was just looping over and over again.. I started to look around for her, barely able to keep my mouse under control because I was shaking. I felt sick to my stomach. I didn’t really want to do this. I don’t know why I said yes to her. But I feel like I’d be letting you guys down if I didn’t see this through.

juliet: Count to 10.

So I counted to ten. I was just going to search from the back of the map to the front. That seems like the most efficient way to go about this. I eventually found her crouched in a corner looking at me.

juliet: You found me.

I didn’t know whether or not she was just going to leave after I found her so I immediately asked her

Distioned: Who exactly are you?

juliet: That’s not the question you should be asking.

Distioned: Then what should I be?

juliet: You should be looking for a place to hide.

And with that, she quit out of the server. I tried for an hour after this trying to get her back. I even made a server named “juliet please join” None of that worked. She’s gone. After all, she got what she wanted. A simple game of hide and seek. But that’s all. I don’t have anymore leads, and I’ve kinda gotten bored of this. If you guys have anymore suggestions, I’ll be open for them.

1363895946.0	1ar3m4	What are some good horror games with minimal jump scares?	Blind_3	72	13	88	"Hello everyone,

I find jump scares as a cheap tactic in most horror stuff, I feel like they don't really make me feel afraid of the situation or atmosphere the game is trying to convey, it just causes fear that something loud will suddenly pop up on the screen.

So what are your picks for games that create an amazing atmosphere with minimal jump scares?

Personally I really liked Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth. The game really had a disturbing and unsettling atmosphere to it, from the odd behaviour of the towns residents, or peering into a basement and seeing a dead lady hanging from a rope, or coming across a crime scene of mutilated bodies. The scene where you have to run for your life had my heart racing (Silent Hill: Shattered Memories reminded me of this scene). 

Games with no combat like Amnesia or Silent Hill: Shattered Memories really help put that fear of the unknown into the player and had a scary atmosphere too.

I do not find games like Slender scary because it is all just fear of the jump scare of not fear of the Slenderman himself (at least that's how I feel about it).

So what are your picks for scariest games that don't use cheap tactics?"	t5_2tv55	True

1356734402.0	15lfql	Creepy driving simulator glitch.	Winter_S	79	19	7	"I while back (about 6 years) this nearby country club did an annual ""Car Festival"". It wasnt anything special, as all people did was bring along `classic` cars and show them off to other people.

Each year, there were various sponsors who came along and advertised there stuff.

One year an insurance company was sponsoring the club. This company had a Driving Test Simulator that people could use to see how good they are at driving.

It was a bit of fun, but was also very technical (you could change the gears with an actual gear stick and it wouldn't start unless you plugged your seatbelt in.)

This simulator had **very** basic graphics. The 3D graphics were composed of a small amount of polygons, and the textures were single colours. I think it was running on a Windows 2000 or 98 machine, but I cant be sure.

I decided I would give it a go, and see how well I would do (I knew it wasn't a serious thing, and just for fun. But I didn't care).


I sat down in the chair, buckled myself in, and started the game.

Before I say what happens, I will describe the layout of the map.

* A grey road that goes round in a *complicated* route.
* Various bridges that your could drive over, that had a road going underneath.
* Hills/Mountains in the background (These were part of the map, and not a picture put onto the skyline.
* A River surrounding the map (I assumed you drive into it and the game says ""you have crashed."" 


The game started (in third person) with me in my car, remember, this game was either very old, or just had a very limited machine to run on.

The game didn't even have sound.

I drove around the map, but honestly the game play was pretty mundane.

I got to a a bridge on the map, and drove onto it. I was pretty bored with the game (as I wasn't going anywhere that fast) so I decided to drive off the bridge to test the gravity.

I made a sharp right, and drive through the wall of the bridge. And I am flying. Looks like they didn't install gravity into the game engine.

I noticed the wheels on my car were starting to jump between the ground and the car itself, which was humorous to watch for a while. As I start driving, the car increased in speed. I tried the brakes but they weren't working.

I floored it and the car itself didn't go any faster, but my speedometer was saying I was increasing in speed.

The cars model then started to morph shape, and became slightly distorted (some polygons rotated a few degrees. Its not like the car was exploding).

I notice I was driving towards the river that surrounded the map, being up in the air (only by a few meters. I was still the height I was when I left the bridge) I knew I could just fly over the river and escape the clutches of the grey road.

I drive/fly over the bridge and suddenly the game emits a white noise/squealing noise, which was weird as the game didn't seem to have sound.

All of a sudden my character floats above the car itself (car continues) and starts to spin around. This goes on for a few seconds, when suddenly the character models limbs just expand in size, and the head of the character grows.

The model stops spinning with the character at an angle, but for the most part it was looking at me (I could tell it was looking at me, as it had `hair`(brown texture colour) on one side of the head but not the other.)

All I see is the head of the character on the screen when the beeping suddenly increases in volume, and the game resets.

Now I'm back at the beginning. But in the background is a car in the air, and a expanding character.

All of a sudden there is a beep, and the game shuts down.

All the time I was freaked out.

1361595082.0	192dd2	Something creepy happened to my brother and I last night.	the5souls	70	15	31	"Every night for the past few weeks, my brother and I would go on YouTube and watch different people play through various horror games, like Amnesia, Slenderman, SCP, and many other indie horror games. There are tons of channels dedicated to people playing scary games, but over time we settled with one or two that we liked. We'd hook the laptop up to the TV, shut the door, turn down the lights, and lie in our beds watching these videos together for hours. Sometimes we end up staying up until 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning forgetting that we have class in just a few hours. 

Last night at around midnight, we ran out of interesting videos to watch from our usual batch of people, so we decided to click on a user we haven't watched yet. [This particular player was playing a PC game called ""White Day""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLGRFj06Qs4), an old Korean horror game made in 2001 which has been translated into English. The main character wanted to place a gift on his crush's desk for Valentine's Day at night when not many students were at the school. My brother and I enjoyed the players's commentary and his style, so we continued to watch him play.

Some time into the game, he walked into a dark room and picked up a note that was sitting on a table. In partially broken English, it was titled ""Ghost Story - The Impossible Maths Problem"". It was about a girl who was constantly teased about her inability to do basic math problems. She was visibly nervous whenever she was called up to the board to solve a problem, and the other schoolkids enjoyed her misery. She became more anxious about her math abilities as time went on until one day she suffered a heart attack and collapsed to the floor. The note ended with, ""...I feel that she is still there sometimes, trying to solve the maths problem.""

The player laughed as he read the last line, and closed the note. When he did, a small shadowy figure of a girl appeared in the darkness in front of him, and attacked him. He screamed and ran out of the room and down the hallway while cursing and catching his breath. As he ran down the hallway, the video suddenly froze and the entire screen was covered by a random checkerboard mixture of pixelated squares while the TV made loud erratic sounds. 

My brother and I stared at the screen, thinking it was part of the video. Then we stared back at each other, and then back at the screen. After about 30 seconds of strange sounds and scrambled pixels, my laptop shuts off and the TV goes completely black. We laid in our beds motionless for a few moments. 

I turned my laptop back on, and the video automatically resumed from where it left off. I checked my power settings. It still had plenty of power left, and the ""Put computer to sleep"" settings were all set to ""Never"". We looked at each other one more time, then we continued to watch a couple more videos. Soon, my brother fell fast asleep, and I stayed awake roaming the internet.

Some time later, I looked over to my digital clock. It was around 2:00 AM. I figured I should get some sleep as well. I shut off my laptop, and the light disappeared from the room. I climbed under my blankets and relaxed, slowly closing my eyes. 

Just then, my Xbox made a loud ""ping"" sound. I instantly my eyes opened. The room was filled with a dim color from the glowing power light of the 360. All of the controllers were stowed away in the drawer. Another ping sound, and I heard the disc tray open. Then another ping, and the disc tray closed. I sat up. Ping. Open. Ping. Close. Ping ping ping. Pingpingpingpingpingpingpingping. Open close open close open close. 

I jumped out of my bed, ran up to the Xbox, and yanked out the power cord, immediately stopping the pinging sounds. The glowing light from the Xbox's power gradually faded away, and the room fell back into darkness. I stood there for a bit. I looked at my brother. He was still fast asleep. I walked back to my bed, and I laid there, thinking about what in the world just happened tonight. I fell asleep an hour later."	t5_2tv55	True

He was on the roofs of Riften and was squatting in the sneaking position. Whenever I moved, he moved to get a better look at me. So, I ran out of the city thinking he would follow me. He didn't, so it seemed, so I figured I would explore and figure it out later, I moved Northwest into the woods around Riften periodically looking up at the stars. I kept seeing what I thought was the Assassin on the tops of trees. I saw a hunter sitting on a log and ran toward him, he informed me he was a member of a hunting party and that the other members where killed by spriggans. He wanted me to heal him and to help avenge his friends. I used Healing Hands on him and led him into the cave.
 After I killed the Spriggans and left the cave the Assassin was waiting for me. He just stood there, about 15 to 20 feet from me until I took a step forward. Suddenly, SLAM a giant who was covered in a thin layer of black arrows (Deadric, most likely) hit the ground with such force and speed that I thought you could only get by leaping from the throat of the World. I jumped in real life as I heard the telltale sound of a spell being cast. I looked up to find the Assassin gone. Nothing but the Telltale ripple of Invisibility to give me a clue as to where he had gone.
 I freaked out, I fast traveled all the way back to Whiterun before anything else happened. I haven't played since, not out of fear but because I don't play on school days as a rule. I do find myself wanting to investigate now that I think of this in the broad light of day."	t5_2tv55	True

1364507269.0	1b7bjf	Minecraft Stalker (x-post from /r/nosleep)	proudcatowner	65	18	6	"(not written by me)

I love playing Minecraft. I don’t join servers to play the RPGs, zombie survival games, or to build cities with friends – I like to just play on my own and explore infinitely unique terrain. So lately I’ve been trying to find a fortress and reach The End, and this means building satellite houses far away from my own to expand my search radius.

The second house I built is in a mountainous region covered in depressing bluish grass. One day I started killing a few cows for food in preparation for a trek back to my primary home. After I gathered the cow hide and raw beef, I saw a skeleton archer under a large oak, staring at me. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but its head followed me wherever I walked for a solid minute. The tree it stood under was right on top of my underground home, and when I went inside I kept hearing the clinking of the skeleton’s bones as it walked around. I didn’t make anything of this until I realized that wherever I walked, the clinking was right over my head. I chalked it up to a glitch.

I returned to my original home for more mining, but after a few days I went back to my home in the drab hills for some redecorating. As soon as I opened the door, something felt wrong. Everything looked like it was in the right place, but the walls just seemed off. The only thing I could think of was that the paintings might have changed around. I rearranged them and made a mental note of which ones I had placed and where they were positioned. Even if they had changed, I thought, it was probably some kind of loading bug.

A few days later, I decided to look for a nether fortress. I warped into the cobblestone outpost I had built inside the nether a while ago and prepped for exploration. Now, I know the nether is supposed to be unsettling to begin with, but what happened made me dread going back. When I walked outside, a horde of zombie pigmen were staring at me. I hadn’t hit any of them, so I couldn’t think of a reason for this behavior. I walked around to see what they’d do, and the whole time they just stood in place and stared at me. I walked up to one of them, but as soon as I moved within two blocks it started squealing like it was dying and wouldn’t stop. The whole pack soon followed in squealing at me, so I ran back through the portal.

I made a post about these issues on the Minecraft forums. Most people thought I was making it up, but those who didn’t assumed I had installed a weird mod that wasn’t compatible with the game. This got me thinking. I checked the Minecraft jar file and noticed that it had been modified over a week ago, well after the latest update. I downloaded the latest version and replaced the jar file in hopes that the corrupted version would be gone forever. It was strange, I thought, that someone would go so far out of their way just to screw with a singleplayer save.

After the install, I booted up Minecraft, saw nothing unusual, turned my computer off, and went to bed. After a solid night’s rest I woke up wondering if the game would still pull anything weird. I checked the nether, and the zombie pigmen were acting normally. I ran all the way to my house in the hills and panicked at what I saw -- the room was covered floor to ceiling with creeper paintings. Clearly, someone had accessed my game, modified it, and was still manipulating everything. Feeling helpless, I placed a sign in the middle of the room that said, “Please stop. You win.” In retrospect, this was probably the worst thing I could have done.

All of the paintings immediately disappeared. I spun around a few times and tried entering text into the chat window, but nothing answered. Suddenly, every wall was covered with signs that said, “Please stop. You win.” I tried to run out of the room, but the wooden door had been replaced with an iron version. I tried to craft a switch to open it, but the stick and cobblestone combination produced wheat. I tried other combinations hoping everything was just mismatched, but every single recipe gave me wheat. All of the items in my inventory had been deleted, and my chests were empty. There was no getting out of the cobblestone room.

I stopped trying to break blocks and breathed for a moment. I heard clinking outside the metal door. I walked up to it and found a skeleton peering in. When I punched the door in frustration, it jumped up and down and spun in circles, taunting me.

I was really freaked out and, by this point, figured that someone had definitely hacked the game and had access to my PC. I shut the computer off and hoped that whoever it was hadn’t used a key logger, checked my internet traffic, or watched me browse. I took the bus to my university and went straight to the computer labs. I checked all of my important accounts, and everything looked normal.

I checked my original thread on the Minecraft forums to see if I had any new replies, but there weren’t any. I decided to make a short post explaining the new developments, wondering if this was a prank that other, more tech-savvy people had experienced and taken care of. I was in the middle of writing the post when a PM showed up in my inbox. It was from a user simply named Skeleton, and all it said was, “i miss you.” I debated sending something back, but instead checked the user’s profile. The account had been created seconds before the message was sent. Undeterred, I continued writing my post asking for help when I received another message. It simply read, “stop,” followed by my social security number, cell number, and every password I could remember using in the past two years. I was at the whim of this guy, and all I could think to do was respond.

“What do you want me to do?”

“come back and play”

I hoped that if I indulged him for a while he might get bored and not wreak absolute havoc on my life. I went home as fast as I could and immediately logged into the game. I’m not sure if my home had been rebuilt or if I simply spawned elsewhere, but I found myself inside a vast cathedral rather than my humble cobblestone cube. The interior was barely kept lit by torches. I heard the familiar clatter of bones, and the skeleton appeared before me. It only said, “come.”

I followed the skeleton down an incredibly long hallway with a red cotton path. I got very anxious. The skeleton never broke pace and moved with robotic precision as if it were following a pathing script rather than being controlled by a user. I wondered how such a big cathedral could have been built so fast, but I did not feel like making small talk.

After about ten minutes of walking, we reached an iron door flanked by obsidian columns. The skeleton stopped by a switch and stared at me, so I asked him what he wanted me to do.

“Through the door?”

“yes”

“What am I supposed to be doing?”

“youll see”

“Are you going to stop messing with me?”

The skeleton opened up the iron door but didn’t say anything else. Inside I saw a scene as grisly as something can be in Minecraft. The room’s floor was entirely netherrack, the ceiling was glowstone, and lava covered every brick on the walls. Heads were densely mounted on fence posts, and the Enderman screech looped constantly. I looked around the room but didn’t immediately see anything that told me what I was supposed to do. I noticed that the heads were all PCs with custom textures that looked like normal people, and I checked each of them out. Each one had a sign underneath with a name, but none of them sounded familiar. Eventually, I reached a head that was unsettling – it looked like the closest Minecraft could come to rendering my face, and my name was on the sign below. By this point I already felt like the hacker had me by the balls and was hellbent on freaking me out and who knows what else, but this was the first time violence was ever implied. Without any other references or clues, I took the head. Once I did, Endermen swarmed through the lava and attacked me. I died instantly and respawned in the same place inside the cathedral. The skeleton was waiting for me there.

“Was that it?”

“hahaha, yes! Follow, follow”

The skeleton took off in a different direction from where we were last time. After another extremely long journey through the cathedral, we arrived at a new iron door. Inside this room were cages made of cobblestone and iron bars holding what looked like PCs shifting aimlessly. They all stared at me, and I figured I had to find myself again. Directly in front of me was a box containing a diamond sword, which I took. Fire spawned at random and I nearly burned to death a few times, but soon enough I found my render in one of the cages with my name over its head. There was a lever on the side of the cage, and once pulled, the iron door swung open. I realized I had to kill the NPC, and so I swung away with the sword. This time, once I collected my head, creepers swarmed in from the ceiling and blew everything up.

Again I spawned at the same point in the cathedral, and again the skeleton was waiting for me. It jumped up and down a few times and sped off in a new direction. I was fed up at this point. If there was more of a game to these rooms, I might have understood, but there was no point to anything, at least none I could discern. I caught up with the skeleton and said, “Wait, I’m not doing this anymore. What do you want from me?” The skeleton turned around slowly and stared. After about a minute, it walked forward, stopped right in front of me, and said, “play. or else.” Then it posted a long number and asked if it looked familiar. Some of the digits on the end gave me a chill, and I confirmed by one of the checks lying on my desk that indeed it was my checking account number. I couldn’t afford to walk away yet.

The skeleton led me to room after room, and in each one I had to find some version of myself, collect my head, and then suffer a death as miscellaneous as it was pointless. I would have gotten bored if I wasn’t so stricken with fear for my personal information. This continued till late at night, and I began to fall asleep at the keyboard. When this affected gameplay, the skeleton came up to me, “rest. big play tomorrow.” I was so tired by this point I didn’t even bother to ask when or anything else. I switched the computer off and turned in.

I had trouble sleeping. Several times throughout the night I heard bones clinking outside my door and was too afraid to check what was making the sound. When I woke up the next morning, I sat at my computer and thought about my options. Surely this guy couldn’t monitor me all day every day? There couldn’t be an infinite number of rooms and heads for me to take, right? No matter how I tried to logic my way out of the situation, I kept coming back to determining that I needed to play along for just a bit longer to finally put the craziness to bed.

I logged in and found myself inside the cathedral again, but the skeleton wasn’t there. I kept the game open and meandered about my house, always checking in. Eventually, after sundown, the skeleton came back. “been busy. lets play.”

I followed the skeleton again for about an hour. The same exercise was repeated over and over, each room with a slightly different take than the last. Before he let me go, the skeleton pressed a button on one of the pillars near my spawn point. The floor opened up, and below was an enormous pit stacked with heads. There were dozens of them, and it took me a moment to realize they were my own. Without thinking I typed, “What the fuck. This is sick.” The skeleton jumped up and down and ran circles around me. It pasted my bank account number over and over again. Finally, it yelled at me.

“LEAVE.”

I didn’t need to be told twice.

That night, as I tried to sleep, I dreamed of the pit, except it was real. I sat helplessly among dozens of heads. I picked one up and looked into its milky eyes. Its lips were parted, and its jaw seemed to move. I thought I could hear breathing, and as I held it up to my ear, it screamed. I woke up immediately.

I decided to log on fifteen minutes before the time I did the day before. Exactly fifteen minutes later, the skeleton appeared again and we repeated the trek down directionless halls, the room reveal, finding my body, collecting my head, and an inescapable death. We did this for an hour, and at the end he showed me how full the pit was getting. I went to bed and had the same nightmare, except there were more heads this time and I swear I heard clinking bones right next to my bed.

This has been going on for two weeks. Every day the pit fills up with more heads, and we’re getting closer to the end. My friends are telling me that I’ve been acting strangely, but I don’t want to tell them what’s happening to spare them in case the skeleton finds out. Each night the dreams get more vivid. I’m drowning in a well of my own heads, and they’re becoming more and more real and more and more alive. I’ve developed a morning ritual of staring at myself in the mirror, as if to make sure that my head is still on my shoulders. The skeleton was holding a sword last night instead of a bow, and when I thought I heard it inside my room, I felt something sharp and cold against my neck. I don’t care about my personal information anymore, I just want the nightmares to end but I can’t bring myself to stop playing.

I don’t know what to do.

I bought the Urbz: Sims in the City, The Sims 3 for Wii and PC. Since I didn't have to download the Wii version, I jumped right into it.

Usually when you're just standing around and you're in an okay mood in the game, your Sim has a normal, content expression. Mine, from my Avatar, was distraught almost 24-7. Instead of looking slightly to the right like it did from the start, it would stare at me for long intervals... Sometimes ranting it seemed, in endless Sim jibberish. My friends and I sometimes made fun of this when they were over and watched me play. This seemed to increase the outburst of the Sim, but only I noticed it.
""Nah Jim, he's just programmed to do that for some reason. Don't trip"" This sentence has a special place in my mind, because it was the first sentence in English my Sim ever said to me. After a day at work, I sent my Sim to go to sleep. It sat down on the bed, and paused. The avatar looked at me, and said it. ""Nah, Jim."" ""He....'s just.. programmed..""


What. The. Fuck.


Pause game Okay. At this point, my dick is in my intestines. He finishes the sentence, then lays down and goes to sleep. His dream clouds are all pictures of frowny faces. All of them. The next morning, I wake him up an hour before his work, and put him on Free will mode hoping he'll fill as many motive bars as he can before work, then go to work at the appropriate time. So I thought.
He goes into the vacant backyard, still all just empty grass since my recent move in. I neglected to empty his inventory since my last grocery pickup, therefore he had a full inventory of various food. He started dropping some of the meat products in a straight line, on free will mode. I figured this happened if the meat went bad or something, but this thought was warped after he changed course on his meat dropping. Within a minute, he spelled out the word ""FREEDOM"".
Again, what. the. fuck. Of course Jim get's the fuck up psychopathic conscious version of the game.
pause game Okay, turning off free will. I still remember, as I moused over the free will box, I saw a thought bubble appear over my Sims head in the background, even though it was paused. It was just another frowny face. A yellow, almost terrifyingly simple frowny face. I unchecked the box, and unpaused. My Sim stood motionless, with the mocking thought bubble still appearing and disappearing. Stupid frowny face.. Honestly folks, this only got worse and more uncomfortable. I mean, I figured the Wii version was going to have it's nice share of bugs, but this was ridiculous. I was getting to know this lady in the game, I mean I gotta have kids eventually right? I got the relationship to 100 (with a heart) and planned to ask her to move in with my Sim. But, it was around this point that my curiosity hovered around the dormant consciousness of this Sim. Why did it spell that word? why is it sad when it's mood is full in-game? So.. I did what I thought was the only was to... communicate I guess. I turned on Free Will mode again.
The constant thought bubbles of the frowny face slowed down, almost too coincidental it seemed. With a previously filled, by me, full inventory, it began it's 'free will'. first thing that happened, he ran all the way across town, a 2 hour ingame walk to his 'girlfriend's house. It was fascinating to watch. The command bar filling up with the 'Chat' command, followed by the 'Ask to Move in' command. I didn't even think Sims were programmed to love. I laughed in amazement at the sight. The avatar of my Sim looked at me disapprovingly. He motioned toward the girl, and looked at me seriously. Like a best friend in dire straights would.


Sometimes I would be playing loud dubstep while playing the game, and my Sim, on freewill, would begin dancing ecstatically without any ingame radio playing. It looked and sounded like my Sim tried talking to me ALL the time, too. No one was around but his girlfriend, usually. And both the avatar, and the regular Sim would be looking up at me like a God in the sky.


It was fucking fascinating. I still have the game, and will post videos/pics of the weird mannerisms if I can find a camera. Just started playing it again since like 4 months ago, and weird stuff still happens. He seems a lot more restless though, and on free will, tends to work out and argue/do negative or mean social options to people. Especially to his girlfriend. Thought bubble changed from Sad to Angry.


**TL;DR: Seemingly self conscious Sim fucks with me hardcore**

UPDATE: i left him alone again for about 5 minutes (which activates free will mode regardless) and he walked (even though the default moving animation is running) to the beach nearby, stopped, and stayed there staring out at the ocean. When I moved him, there was no thought bubble. His avatar was smiling actually, most of the time. I'm going to experiment with the Sim to see if I can get more ... ""conscious"" reactions.


UPDATE 2: My Sim 'acted' normal for a while. I played for about 4 hours, and everything was run of the mill Sims game. Natually, after 5 minutes and the free will kicked in, he did something I never saw before, nor thought could be possible.
He fucking called every Sim i met to this point and invited them to a party at my extremely small house with my Sim who has the Loner perk. There was about 30~ Sims that came over? Is this possible with Free Will?

UPDATE 3: So I can't really take a pic with my webcam, as it's attached to my PC and no where close to the TV. Next time one of my buddies is over with a camera phone or something, I'll play and hope weird shit happens again. I'm playing right now, nothing really weird has happened. The only thing is when he walks over to the beach after I let it sit. I also noticed this recently, my Sim is seemingly incapable of talking to other Sims face to face. I can chat, use the phone, blah blah blah but no social interactions work face to face.. at least the ones I tried. "	t5_2tv55	True

1368581665.0	1ecsjh	Those truly memorable game scares...	mrminutehand	52	7	37	"I know topics about everyone's scariest gaming moments pop up everywhere, but I wanted to mention a few I hadn't seen mentioned before, and ask you - from childhood to now, what are your most memorable creepy game moments?

My most memorable horror moments come from **Silent Hill 3**, as that was the first horror game I truly played. 13 years old, end of first secondary school year, I see this game has just been released and think to myself: ""Only a 15+ rating? It can hardly be that scary"" (UK ratings go up to 18+). Boy was I mistaken. Cue 13 year old me guiding Heather through the early shopping mall, feeling the adrenaline pumping each time I have to guide her back and forth by huge towering creatures into bread and book stores, and I'm already creeped out. Then the elevator ride into hell. Darkness, bleeding and rusty walls, howling dogs, noises and cries that may or may not be real, empty toilet stalls opening, sounds of weeping children, convulsing nurses, nightmares crawling out from under the bed, blood pouring out faucets and onto your reflection followed by your reflection stopping moving, a faceless woman holding a baby doll over a black void, - I had never expected it was possible to feel actually immersed and frightened by a video game. You can pause horror movies, of which I'd seen many, but in this game there was no respite until you dragged yourself to the next save point. I imagined that if I was Heather, I'd earlier put the gun to my head than be able to go through all that.

For my first horror game experience, it was like grinding my nervous system into constant sensory overload, and what's more, the PS2 was in my younger sister's room at the time, and what did she have decorating the bed and walls? DOLLS. Staring through me every time I sat in the dark playing. When one fell off the shelf during playthrough, I thought ""**** that"" and brought my cat into the room every time I dared to play. That cat has seen some shit now. I didn't sleep too well that summer.

I have more memorable moments, but what were yours? Which horror games influenced you most, especially when you were younger?

1350334142.0	11j45z	Fallout New Vegas Yes Man stalker	olijackson64	74	26	31	"I was playing Fallout New Vegas and only played the main quests up until Benny escapes with the chip from the casino. I went to his room, saw Yes Man and had a brief conversation, the left to wonder the wasteland. The last thing Yes Man said was, see you around, I just thought nothing of it really. After walking around for awhile and came across Nipton, the Caesars came out of the front doors of the town hall and told me to warn others of what they are capable of, ignoring them, I explored Nipton. I walked into the shop where the man with the broken legs sat. Had a conversation with him, nothing interesting, and went upstairs to explore more. This is when the freaky stuff started. I heard shouting coming from downstairs and ran down. Yes Man was stood over the Powder Gangers corpse, his head missing from his body and the room, it was nowhere to be found. The only conversation option with Yes Man was goodbye. I thought nothing of it as the game is fairly buggy. 

Out side of the shop I saw the guy that normally runs over to you, the lottery winner. Except he wasn't running over to me because a corpse can't run. Spread across the floor with lottery ticket in hand and just like the other corpse, the head was nowhere to be found. Confused, I walked down the main street where all the bodies on the crucifixes were situated. Too my surprise they weren't all there. The bodies remained attached to the crucifixes but their heads had been removed. It was beginning to get uncomfortable. The best way to get rid of it is to leave the area, I thought, the best way to do that is to fast travel so that's what I did, all the way to El Dorado Gas &amp; Service. Once there I entered the building.

Each of the missing heads were placed around the room with a smile on its face and in the centre stood Yes Man. A conversation started. He said things like, 'always happy to help' and 'I was programmed to be helpful' out of place. Then after about one and a half minutes his face filled nearly the full screen and it changed. Yes Man's face now became Victors, he said, ""Ain't gonna escape me! Join the rest of your pals, they've been waiting for ya!"" With that, each head screamed and flew at my character, killing him.

1340689918.0	vm7l3	"I literally shouted ""nope"""	Pouyong	62	15	13	"This glitch happened just hours ago while playing a second playthrough of Condemned Criminal Origins. First I would like to say this game is already freaky enough, not pee your pants scary/creepy but the kind where your skin crawls. Anyways, I was on mission 9, the apple orchard, at the part where you get to the attic. I fended off the shadow demon who appears out of nowhere, which is unsettling to say the least, and try to continue toward the last clue, but the room I need to go into is boarded up. (about 3:50 into the video I linked). I'm not talking about a loose board, it was 6 or 7 boards, in a row nailed onto the frame. I thought this was strange, because I can see that the writing I was suppose to follow goes into that room. And after searching online, because I thought this was a bit odd, I found that there were no signs that the room was ever boarded up.

So I did what any sensible person would do: beat it with the sledgehammer I had. Nothing, but I did get a weird visual that would pop up. It looked like a heart, was red and was beating, and would go back to the game. By this time I was getting unnerved, because footsteps kept happening and I couldn't progress. So I finally looked away from the door, outside the barn, to see if I could find ANYTHING to help me progress, but when I turned back towards the door the boards where all gone. This game freaks me out, skin crawl kind of creepy, but this incident made me think twice before proceeding. 

Sorry for the length, but I had to get it all in there. Never had a weird, creepy glitch like this so this is a first, also a first posting into r/creepygaming        (video of the level I'm talking about if interested:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4XzQ8jWFcg)"	t5_2tv55	True

Then I came across this one town [the name slips my mind] and I decided like any good gamer, ""Let me slaughter everyone."" So I go break into a few houses, and the NPC's begin to disturb me a little. Everyone seems well dressed, well fed, and it seemed as if the town was a little patch of society that survived the war. But then I talked to some of the NPC's, they began to point fingers at this one house, speaking of a killer and the falsehood of security in which they live in. So I break into this house, where I see a family. The child of the family begins to talk about his father's ""work."" Curious, I pickpocket the key and break into the cellar.  
I found dead bodies in cages, bonesaws scattered, bones and ""mysterious meat"" in fridges. Enraged, I go back upstairs and quickly kill them with the weapons which they used to slaughter those others. I then take what I can, and never return to the town."	t5_2tv55	True

1344757283.0	y348t	Looking for a game to play?	tom0824	54	9	24	"A lot of people in this subreddit have been wanting suggestions for a game to play lately. I'll put out this guide for people that want to find something new.

For those who want something genuinely scary. (jumpscares, being chased/stalked by monsters,) you should try...

•Slender/Amnesia (duh)
•Exmortis/Purgatoriam (2 terrifying point-and-click flash games, great if you don't have a high end computer)
•Ao Oni (a Japanese horror game, played from a top down perspective, that while may not seem that impressive at first, can prove to be quite effective at creating a tense atmosphere.)
•SCP- Containment Breach (a unique take on the Monster/Player chase scenario. In this game, the monster cannot move while the player is looking directly at it. If you look away from it, or your blink meter runs out, the monster is able to move very quickly until you look at it again. Simple, yet effective.)

If you are looking for a game that's creepy (something that has a general dark atmosphere/undertone) try...

•The Alice is Dead series (another flash point-and-click game. Based on Alice in Wonderland. A lot of subtle, yet effective elements contribute into the games over all creep-factor.)
•I Have no Mouth, and I Must Scream (based on Harlan Ellison's short story. Set in a post-apocalyptic world where a supercomputer named AM keeps and tortures 6 people as he runs them through a simulation of their worst nightmares. It's an older game, but if you can get it to work on your computer, I recommend it.)
•Ib (played in a similar manor to Ao Oni. Creepy, and mysterious. A wonderful, yet dark game. This is one of the more artistic games out there, but still scary nonetheless.)

Well, I hope I was able to help some of you who are trying to get into the genre. And to anyone else who is looking for something new to play, I hope you found it here!

I'm gonna do my best to relay it from memory and from a few shorter notes we wrote about it at the time it happened.

Acegarnish was a typical dwarvern fortress, and came with all the typical perils. Most of the dwarves were massively cave-adapted, so vomiting in sunlight was normal, miasma was becoming an issue, there were always too many cats and not enough booze - especially since water was an issue, as there was no river within the fortress' area. Thankfully some properly dorfy engineering with a stagnant pool, frequent rain, channels and a well had kept them alive.

However, one fateful day my friend fired up the fortress and immediately received a non-specific ""A cave-in has occurred!"" message. Searching around for where it happened, he discovered in the air outside his fortress a few tiles with nothing in them.

For those of you not familiar with Dwarf Fortress, when you go into selection mode and examine any given tile, it will list everything on that tile in the order they are stacked, with most seemingly empty tiles just having soil or gravel or whatever material as their floor listed. Moving into the air results in tiles with (empty space) in their list. These particular tiles literally had *nothing* in them. No list. No (empty space). No labels. Even when you totally exposed them, they would not become any kind of visible tile. Just floating blocks of nothingness.

Well, my friend wasn't one to be put out by that weirdness. He figured it was just a typical glitch like the floating anthills that actual cave-ins sometimes left behind, or crossbow bolts stuck in midair. Such is life in the mad, ever-alpha world of Dorf Fort. He instead figured the original cave-in must have had a cause, so he set his dwarves digging in the area directly under the strangely empty spaces, hoping for a cave, a lake or an underground river or somesuch. So down his dwarves went, picking away through the rock.

And then they [found something](http://i.imgur.com/DDJsy.jpg).

A single tile - or perhaps several, it's difficult to tell - deep underground.

Every dwarf that touches it instantly becomes terribly injured, and dies seconds later, frozen to death. Then their flesh is flayed from their bones. Then their skeleton disintegrates, along with their clothes. All that remains is whatever metal items they were carrying.

Other dwarves greedily rush to pick up their strewn equipment, but quickly meet the same fate - wounded, through their entire body, every limb and organ taking damage simultaneously - and then dying, decaying, and vanishing, all in a matter of seconds.

""Great evil lies in the earth beneath Acegarnish. A malignant and terrible force, beyond the ken of dwarves and men. The dwarves, in their terror, walled off that cursed place, and forbade it to all but the most senior members of the hold. Such things must be left undisturbed, lest they be the end of us all.""

I still have the world file for this damnable fortress, my housemate sent it to me after he first discovered the anomaly. I've been meaning to open it again, but... some things might just be better left buried.

Edit: I'm firing up my laptop to copy across the save file and the old DF now. It might take a few hours while I re-acquaint myself with DF and its horrendous UI.

Edit2: The zip I have contains a whole bunch of typical save data - a load of art_image-#.dat, feature-#-#.dat, region_snapshot-#.dat, and mostly unit-#.dat (where # is any given series of numbers appropriate to the particular file), but no world.sav or world.dat. I'm pestering my old housemate directly, but he's busy faffing around in EVE Online, so this might take a while longer."	t5_2tv55	True

When we get in the game we notice that there are no npcs around. everywhere we go there is no one. He quits and starts it up again and once again no one is around. My friend looks into the distance and sees some cars moving. he goes up there and he starts killing people. All npcs except cops start running away. Eventually he gets killed.

1363200273.0	1a8byq	Anyone remember Echo Night? (PS1)	albertvii	43	7	7	"Growing up I always watched my friends play horror PS1 games (which I was too much of a pussy to play) which for some reason scared me a hell of a lot more than the modern games we see today, something about really shitty pixilated graphic ghosts/apparitions tied in with the bad environmental graphics at the time held more shock value than the games I have seen today.


One game in particular though was Echo Night, I remember my buddy picked it up for his Birthday and he wanted to play it, the game was simple, the game played in first person view (which was difficult to move around in since the analog stick wasn't around at the time this game was released). I watched my friend play the game as the story unfolded about finding your missing father who suddenly vanished, after searching your father's house, you find a hidden room in his house with a picture of a giant cruise boat, which then you magically get transported on the boat, where the rest of the game mainly takes place.


The boat was unsettling, you go through a few cut scenes and eventually have full control to start exploring the ship, so my friend started going through the ship. When going inside dark rooms, you can always hear giggling, leaving things more unsettling, usually there isn't any music to accompany it, just silence and the occasional giggle. If you look around, you'll eventually run into [this girl.](http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/9/f/gfs_42071_2_44.jpg) If you happen to make eye contact with her, she'll pick you up using some supernatural power and throw you across the room, and you take damage. You can't attack the ghost girl either, the only 'weapon' you will have is light, which the way to fix this is to find a light switch and flip it on, and the girl will disappear from the room (you can still turn it off and she will come right back too).


The entire game consisted of solving puzzles and going back into the past of certain events that some ghosts of the ship had gone through and you try to right what was wrong. All while avoiding the creepy ghost girl (and other ghosts later as you progress further in the game).


Whatever it was about this game, it haunted me for YEARS, the concept of it I thought was brilliant, and yet I haven't seen any other games like it. I used to hide my head under the pillow when I turned the light off in my room because of fear of hearing a girl giggle. 


Aside from the personal experiences of this (and leading me to writing this entry to /r/creepygaming) there was a time I was watching my friend play the game and he progressed pretty far into the story, eventually he got to a point where the ghost girl went away permanently off the ship and no longer haunted him. At that point he started exploring more of the ship and at one point actually went to an area that took him outside to the deck of the ship. The area was really tiny, only two doors (the one you came out of, and the other door that takes you to another part of the ship), and a light switch (which at the time was turned off), you can also see a railing with a view of the ocean and other irrelevant parts of the ship. My friend turned the light on and continued to play but just as we were about to proceed through the door we heard a similar GIGGLE outside on that dock area.


We instantly thought ""Huh, well we got rid of the ghost girl so this is strange"" and I dared him to turn the light off, and he did. What happened next disturbed me deeply and STILL does to this day.


The dock area was dark and we looked around as we can still hear the giggling, we looked back at the door we came from and nothing was there and looked back at the door that we were going to go through and a mist/apparition appeared that had two eyes and a mouth that looked like would drop down to where its legs would have been (keep in mind this looks NOTHING like a girl that we were anticipating), it had NO legs, it floated at you, and ended up attacking him. The screen in the game shook tremendously and put him in a possessed state which he needed an item to fix that and then he needed to heal himself. But that apparition/whatever the fuck that thing was nearly killed him in one blow. 


The strange thing in this game is that 'ghost' has no significance to the rest of the game at all, it's like a creepy easter egg they decided to throw in there. Regardless of getting rid of the ghosts later in the game, that part of the ship in that ONE room still has a girl that giggles and if you turn the light out you're fucked (or close to being almost fucked).


Unfortunately, the game has disappeared from my possession and all the let's play videos I can find had no encounter with this apparition.. I tried looking up screenshots for this thing and couldn't find it either.


I wanted to post this to see if anyone else knew what I was talking about, it'd be even better if someone were to find pics of the thing. But I can only hope.

This happens every time but I had never realised it before that set me on edge a little bit but then things started to get weird, I was playing a community map (cant remember the name it was something to do with the multiverse.

Everything was fine, it was actually a clever level, set in the old aperture center. The level its self was nicely designed and just the right amount of tricky. At the end you do a long jump towards the elevator and on this level it had been intentionally locked (the gate didnt open) so you have to walk down to this room where there are just some controls and a red button, usually this puts the chell model in the door with these glowing white eyes, which is creepy enough but it only lasts for a few seconds before cutting to a screen about the multiverse being created.

On my first play through the trigger for this was set off early. Almost as soon as I walked through the door there was a camera shutter sound so i turned around and was presented with a model of Chell in a warped position (sort of crouching with her arms open as if to grab something/ someone) with yellowish glowing eyes. I wasn't expecting this to happen at all and stood/ wandered around the room thinking the game had broken for about a minute. Finally i turned and pressed the button the camera immediately zooms straight in on this other chells face before cutting to the default cutscreen.

I played it through again wondering if this was the intentional outcome of the level but the other Chell only appeared once the button had been pressed and wasn't nearly as unnerving.

Capcom was on fire in 2005 when they released Killer7 (they had also just released Resident Evil 4 and Viewtiful Joe) and no one knew what the hell to make of it. How did this game get released and what did they think people were going to think of it? It was, and still is, like nothing ever released by a major game studio. In what major release games on a system released by the eternally family-friendly Nintendo will you ever find things like severed heads talking to you, tortured dead souls acting as your guide (one dressed in a full body bondage suit), themes such as self-mutilation, suicide, suicide bombings, terrorism, rape, pedophilia, and extreme violence all drenched in a twisted surreal landscape with some of the most uncomfortable and eerie music composed for gaming.. and to top it off, bizarre and insane enemies that cackle and laugh when they come towards you, full prepared to explode themselves to kill you.

Everything about this game is weird, creepy, disturbing and unsettling and will forever be one of my favorite games for those reasons. Not to mention the overall storyline is much deeper than I think even the creator knows. It is a dark hole worth plunging into, with a killer (pun intended) ending and one that will make you think and stay with you for years. 

**TL;DR:** r/creepygaming, if you are looking for a cult creepy game that you may have overlooked, please check out Killer7. A game more than worthy of your attention.

1343188243.0	x435y	I have an idea for a horror game. Any tips?	Prisonfishy	43	7	41	"you are not alone in your own home. 

You awaken in the middle of the night to a strange sound (thump, cough, etc.) you notice that there is a light on outside your room. You investigate every shadowy corner of your house until you face the source of the disturbance, experiencing terrifying, tension-building events along the way.

Why creepy?

Your home is supposedly a place of familiarity. However, it becomes uncomfortable as you see shadows you shouldn't see, hear creaking boards and footsteps you didn't make, and see malicious figures and twisted faces in the darkness.
Sound will be a factor in determining where the intruder lies. A lack of ambient sound (fan, breathing, etc) creates silence that can be easily broken by foreign, disturbing noises. Your heart rate increases as you search through drawers and cabinets, only to be met with darkness and greater tension. Electronic appliances may randomly turn on, you may hear a rapping at the window. A sense of ambiguity will constantly keep the player on edge.

I'm thinking that the player may randomly see the intruder (which will be represented by a pale, dismembered face in the darkness that spirals towards you) when he/she turns around and looks down a long hallway or something. I'm not entirely sure as to what the intruder should look like, but I'm thinking something like the creature at the end of SCP-087.

EDIT: Awesome suggestions, everyone. I'm thinking of naming the game ""Don't Hide From Me,"" as a reference to the chilling Psalm 102, A Prayer in Time of Trouble.
 ""I pray to you, LORD! Please listen. Don't hide from me in my time of trouble. Pay attention to my prayer and quickly give an answer. My days dissapear like smoke, and my bones are burning as though in a furnace. I am wasting away like grass, and my apetite is gone. My groaning never stops, and my bones can be seen through my skin.

As weird and improbable as it may seem, this glitch really happened to me. 

I was playing Assassin's Creed 1 in the Rich District of Jerusalem, finding and killing all the Templars in the area (for those who haven't played the game, that's both a 'collectible' and an achievement/trophy), and found the one in the NW walled area (where you go after Talal). I killed the Templar and got the message for him being added to my collection.

As I went to leave the walled area, the icon for being chased (while not in a guard's line of sight) started flashing...I jumped in a rooftop garden and hid...after about 30 seconds of hiding, it still showed me as being chased (usually after you hide for just a few seconds that goes away). I exited the hiding spot (I never entered the ""cooldown"" mode so wasn't autolocked inside) and was about to jump down and run out of the city when I heard someone climbing on the ladder and cursing in French. I looked down and there was my Templar, still chasing me! I waited for him to climb up and killed him again. This time no message appeared, and it still showed me as being chased.

I ran out into the main part of the district, hoping to lose him or at least recruit some vigilantes to help me fight him....and realized that the entire city was empty. Not a single civilian, not a single guard, not a single monk or vigilante to be found. It was just me and him in what was suddenly a ghost town.

I waited for him in an open area, deciding I would slay this abomination of bad game programming. I didn't have to wait long, as he soon found me again. Again I killed him, but this time it showed me that I had returned to being anonymous.

I ran up to a minaret (viewpoint in muslim districts) to see if I could spot anyone in my area of the city, and as I climbed it the icon for being in the line of sight of an alert but still inactive guard (the red eye) appeared. I looked around and saw no one, so quickly continued my scaling of the tower, knowing that at least I'd be safe up there.

When I reached the top, the chased icon suddenly began flashing again - he was back. I turned on eagle vision (for those who haven't played the game, it's kinda like thermal imaging, but allows you to distinguish between friend and foe) to see if I could spot him from a distance (seeing how he evidently always started chasing me at his spawn point). I kept looking, but didn't see him. I jumped off the tower into a nearby haypile and looked waited again, facing the direction of his spawn point.

Suddenly, I was attacked from behind. He had somehow come from the opposite direction this time (maybe he had ran that way while I was up on the minaret?) and he had blindsided me. I fought him, and as I did so noticed that he still had the blood spots from his previous deaths. I fought and killed him yet again.

I tried hiding in more places, but none of them seemed to work...so I waited for and killed him 5 more times. By this time my health was getting very low - I hadn't been out of combat long enough to heal. I decided to just run for the exit. As I did, he ran up behind me again. I turned around to face him, and before I could parry and counter, he attacked and killed me. I, of course, was desynchronized and sent back to an earlier save point in the city. When it finished loading, the city had returned to normal and I was anonymous. Needless to say I shut the game off and didn't play it for a long time after that!

Now, I'll understand if you don't believe me - I would only at best half-believe it myself if it hadn't happened to me. But it did. I'm not saying that the game was haunted, just that I had accessed some glitches that in unison made the experience scary. Just having an empty city would have been eerie (I know, as I've accessed that glitch in Acre), or having him continually chase me until he killed me wouldn't have been so bad had there been other people there. But the two in unison made the experience truly creepy, and more than a little scary. It honestly felt like the game was demanding my death, and bending the rules of gameplay, continually reincarnating this undead Templar hellspawn in order to achieve that, at the time. o.O But it was just a glitch - something that the Assassin's Creed games are riddled with!

Anyways, that's my story! Hope you liked it. If you experienced that glitch or similar glitches, be sure to let me know in the comments. Thanks for reading!"	t5_2tv55	True

1369549837.0	1f2kl0	I have a sort-of Polybius experience, I think...??? And a question.	BuenoBob	50	18	9	"In or around 1984, I played a video game at a local mart here in Portland, Oregon. I cannot and WILL NOT say it was Polybius, because I don't know if that was the game's name or not. I will say this. I inserted .75 (which at that time, as I recall, surpassed even Dragon's Lair at .50), so I figured it was going to be ONE HELL of a game. I was not disappointed.
The game (if you can even call it that, for reasons I'll explain) was superimposed with bizarre imagery. The opening scene was an ocean beach at sunset. And it was an actual PHOTOGRAPH - not a nth bit graphics engine at work. There was a VIDEO of a rocket launching into the night sky, shot from relatively close up.
The game had a control stick and a button. There were no instructions and the button was not labelled at all. I presumed the stick was self explanatory and the button was ""fire"". I assumed that the the introductory picture and video were my home planet and that I was going into space to defend it from some alien invader or something.
There was a very basic game that started up at that point and it looked ridiculous, as if there was little else running it other than a hamster on a wheel...the screen was choppy and the colors were all bland (even for 1980s standards). I played this game for approximately 30 seconds, but the button didn't respond to anything. I pressed it repeatedly, but it didn't fire, and it seemed that the controller only moved the ship a bit, like the ship was reluctant to respond.
Suddenly, without fighting any enemies, that screen completely cut away and there was a picture of an abandoned field at night, illuminated only by the the moonlight. That cut away and there was a VIDEO of two fully armored knights having a sword fight (at that point, I totally freaked out and started button mashing, afraid that I was going to lose a fight or something.
At this point, I was absolutely baffled - I had no idea what was going on with this game, but I was completely sure something was seriously fucked with it.
The pseudo-spaceship game came back on and I freaked out AGAIN, trying to adjust to the ever changing....video game I was playing, for lack of a better word. I didn't think it WAS a video game anymore, at all, and I didn't know what the fuck was going on, but I actually started to get a little scared.
Thee screen flipped back over and showed me a sword. I think it might have been the sword that the knight was fighting with, but I wasn't sure. There was a castle it showed next. And then the screen flipped back to the start, showed the rocket going up into space, and then, I shit you not....
A nuclear explosion.
The screen said ""GAME OVER"" and just went black dead. It was then that it dawned on me that the screen had also been black dead when I walked up to it. And it didn't dawn on me when I first saw it that a black dead screen usually means ""Out of Order"", I just kinda blindly stuck my quarters in and THAT'S when it came to life.
My cousin came up to get me then as we were ready to leave the store. She even asked me if I was OK, because she said I just looked a bit out of sorts and confused. I said ""I don't get this game. What is it?"" and she said something dismissive and we left the store. I went back to the store the next time I was with one of my parents when they stopped by for whatever reason, but the game was gone. I never thought to ask anybody working there about it, but I wish I would have.
I have always thought about that game in the time since then, wondered what it was and scoured the internet looking for information, BUT...I'm not saying it WAS....but the POLYBIUS rumor/story/myth fits MY personal bill a lot more than I'd like to admit.
So...not saying anything, you draw your own conclusions. But there MAY be more to this legend than just being a story. Does anybody know who started this myth? Because, if s/he is from Portland, or lived here in the early to mid '80's, I might know where s/he got inspiration from and I'd be REALLY, REALLY interested in talking to them."	t5_2tv55	True

Silent Hill introduced me to horror gaming that didn't rely on jump-out scares but I believe Siren was the game that perfected it.

Imagine playing as a guy being abducted by aliens. Technically, the game would play in first person, and feel like amnesia but in a modern environment. At the first part of the game, the alien part would be subtle: lights in the sky, waking up hearing noises, etc. Then one night, you wake up and decide to go up and take a glass of water or something like that. Then suddenly, when you least expect it, a scary as fuck alien teleports in, in front of your face, staring right in your eyes (you cant look away or move), while high volume and pitch audio distortions burn into your ears. The alien could look something like [this](https://badarchaeology.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/streiber_alien.jpg). A moment like that would probably kill me.

UPDATE: I have now beat the game with all 6 sisters, encountering the wolf with all of them. I am sure there are quite a few things I missed, and I look forward to playing through again to get all the items, and to further explore my own interpretations of the game. Now I eagerly away my friends to finish playing so I can discuss it with them. Does anyone know if something different happens if you unlock everything (items/rooms/flowers)?
***
Let me preface by saying, that being raised in the horror genre since I was 6 years old has made me horribly desensitized. If I find something creepy in even the most objective sort of way, I give the source raving reviews to others.

I do not know what to think of this game yet. I have only played 1 character out of 6. It is not ""scary"" in the normal sense of the word. Definitely not jumpy. But there is some sort of build up that happens while playing; the loneliness, confusion, and surrealism messed with me in a way that I'm not sure I've ever experienced with a game. 

The atmosphere is beautiful, absolutely. But after just that 1 play I was left staring blankly at my computer screen, completely unnerved. I had to watch a stupid, vapid cartoon show before going to bed just to get my mind off of it. In the mean time, I will continue playing it a little at a time. 

tl;dr, If you can spare a little to buy it, or have played it, tell me if I'm crazy or if it messed with other people's heads.

So anyway, I was getting pretty good at this game. I only hit the the first ending the two times I played, but the third time, I actually got to the ""good"" ending. The one breaking the fourth wall. The one where Irisu fucking **walks over your desktop into the game with a spike club on an unsuspecting girl**, and the game closes itself.

http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8a230ZG6f1qfzma8.jpg

Now I did open the game again and see the ""happy birthday""-ending. Confused, I went to Google to find an explanation. It wasn't a ""good"" ending. She fucking killed them. All of them.

By this point my skin was fucking crawling and the hairs on my neck felt like they were about to pierce the back of my head. *But intrigued as I was, I kept playing*.

So on my first try, I did really damn good, as I reached 54k points on my very first round. As I ""failed"", I guess I wasn't paying too much attention. But there she was. Her used-to-be transparent silhoutette slowly faded into a bloodyfied mess. And her eyes were like two big glowing rings.

That's when I said, nope, I'm not playing this any more, and slammed my laptops lid.

I was not yet coming down from the panic, the utter *terror* I was feeling, so I got up to go out for a second. Then, as I was standing in the hallway, I realized I was actually very afraid. I wasn't just a little scared from playing the game, but I was completely terrified. I stopped right in my tracks and lit every lamp in my vicinity.

I stepped out on my porch, and lit a cigarette. While I was doing that, I remembered. Irisu. In the game, she came up, sneaking, with a nailbat, on my desktop, then into the actual game window. And the girl she was walking towards had her back faced towards Irisu. At this time I **seriously** paniced. I was too afraid to move. I just stood there, and the only motion I dared doing was to draw from my cigarette. I cramped my back up towards the house wall. That way I wouldn't have anything to be afraid of. People don't come through walls.

As I walked back to my bed, turning off the lights on my way, I was holding up my cellphone to atleast have any kind of light around me. I'm in my bed now, typing this, 1 hour and 40 minutes later, and I still don't think I'm gonna sleep tonight.

Oh. And I'm 20 years old.

1373022572.0	1hoov3	Creepy LittleBigPlanet levels?	fluttersaway	34	7	16	"My brother and I were searching for unpopular and new levels from the LBP community.

When we selected ""Lucky Dip"" on the search menu, we found a lot of levels and tried one called 'lara' by constanza13.  It was unsettling, and we tried more of their levels, like 'playroom' and 'boda'. Those were creepy.

I'll type up our experiences later when I am at my desktop.

What LBP (the original or the sequel) levels have psychologically scared you, unsettled you, or disturbed you without a jump scare?

EDIT: Here's our experience.

There are many copied levels in the ""Cool Levels"", so we dove into the ""Newest Levels"" instead.  It was a good time to critique new levels (~3:00 AM), and some creators might appreciate it.

One level lacked a scoreboard and a finish line.  We commented about it, and the creator added them.  Success!  In another level we fell off a Chinese dragon who was meant to take us to the scoreboard.  The creator of that one didn't immediately respond to our criticism, so we moved on.

We shivered at a level icon of a black-and-white Sackboy and had the level name ""survival"".  That isn't relevant, except that we became tense.  Empty levels started to seem vacant, instead of just empty.

After a while, we stopped looking at the newest levels.  There's a button called ""Lucky Dip"" in the LBP search menu.  I think it's a random list from the published levels.  We pressed it, and some level icons appeared on the Earth.

We were used to seeing bland levels.  It was actually *easy* to comment on bland levels, because they didn't have much fluff.  And we had seen a lot of levels with lowercase names like ""fast boat"" or ""bumpy skateboard"".  My brother was curious about a level named ""lara"", which had a red rock as its icon.  We played it.

The world opened on a cliff.  It had the Wedding background and the fog looked like rust.  There was a row of jetpacks to the right, before a wide hole.  We grabbed jetpacks and pulled them over the hole.

The floor of the hole was electrified, which I discovered by falling into it.  My brother revived me at the entrance and we flew over the hole.  Just past the hole, there was a scoreboard.

In the background, in its usual spot, was the statue from the Wedding theme.  With our jetpacks we flew up to see its face.  The atmosphere of this level was unsettling.  My brother suggested that we may have crossed an electrified River Styx, the boundary between Earth and the Underworld in Greek mythology.

We flew over the scoreboard, to the very end of the stage, and there was nothing else.  So we went to the scoreboard and finished.  There were no points in the level.  The creator of the level wrote Spanish titles for some levels, so we looked up ""lara"" on the Web.  [Supposedly, it can mean ""face"" or ""mug"".](http://www.interglot.com/dictionary/es/en/translate/lara)  It can also be a person's name.

Some of this creator's other levels also seem desolate or unfinished.  We tried ""playroom"" next.  At the start we were in what we thought was the ""playroom"" the creator was making.  There's a table with potatoes on it and a TV nearby.  If you climb up the platforms, you will find a tuxedo'd guy on the ceiling.  The sound of a jet was playing, and I thought a plane was about to crash on our characters (there was no plane).  There's a ramp you can climb later, which takes you to a white structure with a music box in it.  Later, there is a wooden sackboy on a suspended rubber platorm.  After that, there are three sackboys, the second of which says ""are you"".

I guess unfinished levels are unnerving to me.  We've considered the possibility that the levels ""lara"" or ""boda"" are memorials to someone.

Anyway, I hope this was an entertaining read."	t5_2tv55	True

The room was trashed,there was a rune but that wasn't it. I think there was a skeleton laying in the corner, everything was trashed, as I said. It's hard to remember exact details but I do remember quite clearly that a few seconds after I got into the room everything got purplish(I assume because of the rune) but then as I went to pick it up I could hear what sounded like a little girl sobbing repetitively, and I remember occasionally hearing what sounded like the same girl screaming NO! I could also hear footsteps, heavy footsteps running up and down the stairs, however, if I remember correctly, the stairs were blocked off. The room caught me off guard and after grabbing the rune I quickly went off to find another hiding spot.	t5_2tv55	True

Do you like the idea of ""rare"" scenes/scares in games?  For example you may play a game hundreds of times and only once see something you're not even sure you saw.  Think of Minecraft's Herobrine if it was actually real.  I want to make a horror game and think it would be great to have a massive list of randomized events, some that are so insanely rare the community may not even believe it occurred unless you recorded it.  I feel like acts such as these create a real err of mystery that many games lack and can make great urban legends when you can't tell what is real and what is not.  There's obviously the pro of making it so no matter how often you play a game you may see something new, but the disadvantage is that you're creating content that only a small number of your audience will see, and they may not even recognize it was unique, so it could be wasted effort, and the effort could have been used to provide more to your audience at large.  What do you guys think?

2. The closest thing I can think of are games that don't point your view in the right direction, so the scares happen every time but don't force you to look at them so if you replay the scene you may notice things you didn't the first time.  That may be a better way to go about it, making very subtle scares that are accessible to everyone but not everyone will see even if they have the ability to see it.  Would this be a better way to approach these kinds of scares?  The only issue with this approach is they would be easily reproducible once you knew they were there so it wouldn't have the same aura of mystery.

3. Do any of you know of games that have actually done this?  It would obviously work best in a randomly generated game like Minecraft (just an example that's easy to reference and a game that many people know, Minecraft obviously isn't a horror game), because if you're playing a linear game you will often only beat it once or twice so you would have a poor chance of seeing these things occur and you would likely think they were scripted.  I'd be really curious if this has been done in a game and worked well.

EDIT: Interestingly minutes after writing this I heard about a game just announced that could be like I described (http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/08/zombie-studios-unveils-unreal-engine-4-game-daylight).  I still want to go through with making my own game using these ideas though but thought others might want to see this.  The idea I have for my game would certainly be longer than 25-30 minutes as they describe."	t5_2tv55	True

A while back i purchased a Ps2 copy of Legacy of Kain: Defiance. I had played it before and loved it but lost my original copy so i opted to repurchase. It was pretty badly dinged after close inspection and I'm pretty sure I shouldn't have been charged for such a  shoddy copy. Anywho, I brought to my best friends house and we started playing. We had made a pact that i would play Kain and he would play Raziel. 
Well as we played, i handed off the controller to him so get Raziel out of the underworld, the whispers of the damned we noticed were rather loud for this part of the game. Far louder than the voice acting and ambient music. Ignoring it, we got Raziel out and into the graveyard. Still the whispers were loud and incoherent. I remembered that it wasnt like this last time i had played. When it got to Kain again and i grabbed the controller. The damn whispering was still goin. 
We debated reseting but it seemed like a cool glitch. But since the voice acting and story were one of my favorites, we opted to shut down. Upon turning the game back on it went normally to title screen. After a few seconds, the whispering started again. Same damn incoherent whispering. 
Tried several resets and even deleted the save file and started again. Now the whisperings were in Kain's introductory level. We said fuck it and just played through the game. 
The entire game was over burdened with those whisperings of the damned. It started to annoy and eventually creep us out. We could start to make out words that werent there. Hearing our names, our friends and loved ones names, dates, hearing  places that we knew. 
We attributed it to our over active horror driven subconsciousness and imaginations. 
eventually we trudged through the game and finished it. I decided to give it to another gamer friend of mine. Informing him of the issue, he was curious. He took it and called me up after a few days. Evidently my cool little glitch didnt exist. His game and audio ran fine. We thought maybe it was the PS2 we were playing on? We took our Ps2 to his place, popped in the game. And nothing. The game ran smoothly past the first Raziel level and the whisperings played normally and stopped when they were scripted to. 
To this day, we reminisce about it. Partially with fondness and partially with a shudder"	t5_2tv55	True

Anyway. Perhaps this game does not completely fit in the 'creepy' genre as it's basically a game of gathering resources and building your base. What you usually do is find some wood, build yourself a nice house (usually you start with a simple square box as a house), and get a fire going.
But...

The night time in this game is absolutely amazing when it comes to creepiness. I'm telling you, you can't see SHIT unless you have a flashlight/campfire and you will need that campfire to be inside of your house or you're easy prey for other players.

Now, this doesn't sound that scary but imagine just walking around in your house at night, with the soothing noise of the campfire... then you start hearing footsteps. Coming from multiple directions. You have nothing but an axe to defend yourself. You don't have windows to look outside because then people could just come up and shoot you. Then someone starts swinging his hatchet at your door. More people come and start hitting because the door can take a beating. Then they come at you with their axes and you die.


Something else also. You have expanded your base and you plan on adding a third floor. The base is at the bottom of a hill. On a silent night you start working on your third floor and something on the hill catches your attention. It's 2 guys staring at you with a campfire behind them so you can very clearly see their silhouettes. They just stand there the whole night.




Don't know if anyone else who has played it feels like this but I haven't been scared in the dark like this for a while. The music is also a big factor (or sometimes the lack of it).

I'm going to look through some vods of a streamer, the latter thing happened to him somewhat.

I was on the S.W.A.T. team in the beginning of the match. Our spawn was in the front of a dark farmhouse. As we entered the house, I felt like we were being watched. It was such a horrible feeling it almost made me want to just stop playing because I was so uncomfortable, but I kept going. After searching the 1st floor, we went upstairs. I heard a muffled buzzing sound and footsteps as we climb the stairs. Once we entered a room, there was a TV displaying nothing but static, but no people. In the next room, things got interesting. A man in a pig mask pops up and hits one of our members over the head with a metal pipe. After a few bullets, the guy died along with our teammate. My immediate reaction was, of course, NOPENOPENOPENOPE. So I ran away and hid. Yes, I know, my bravery surpasses every gamer here. Anyway, I hid in a closet I and heard footsteps draw closer to me. Suddenly a dark figure appears in front of the doorway looking right at me. After a few shots to the head, he dropped to the floor. I was relieved and gained the courage to come out of the closet. While searching for my squad, a few cans were knocked off a table. I know now that this was from a spectator, trying to scare me. Well, it worked. I started running. I ran outside the house into our spawn and stood there, terrified. Just a few seconds later, a man runs to the doorway and a piece of metal flies through the air straight into my face. So  I die and the round ends. As the menu appears, my immersion ends. 

I know that this isn't a very well written story and that it might not seem much but this was the first time I was legitimately scared from playing online on a game. I wish there were more games that did something like this. If you can find a match still, I'd definitely recommend trying to play this game."	t5_2tv55	True

I started my first play through a few days ago and I was just running around the outskirts of Goodsprings, trying to find some Geckos or other weak enemies to boost my level to get ready to fight the Powder Gangers. I was just exploring the cliff areas when I saw the antennae and the abandoned trailer which I immediately identified as the radio station from the legends, and I must say, I was creeped out already. I went up to it and walked around the outside as the freaky oldies crackled from my tv. I entered the trailer and turned off the radio, messed with the HAM Radio for a bit, and then picked up anything of use, including a Blue Star Sarsaparilla Cap. It was 1am in game, so I decided to sleep in the trailer until 7am. I woke up in the morning facing the back of the trailer, but I was immediately turned around by Marcus(?) who proceeded to engage me in a conversation regarding the blue star caps, the treasure, and the dangers of collecting them. I couldn't focus on what he was saying because I was trying to figure out why and how he had followed me into the Lone Wolf Radio Station just to tell me this stuff. Then, after I exited the conversation, he just disappeared. I don't mean he ran out of the trailer and I couldn't find him, I mean he just disappeared. I ran outside and searched the surrounding area for him, and I even ran back to Goodsprings and over to Primm. He was gone, nowhere to be found, completely and totally absent from the areas that were safely accessible. I have no clue what happened.	t5_2tv55	True

We really enjoyed the concept of one player being the evil that haunts the other players, while they have to somehow defeat him.

However, Slendertubbies at this point isn't exactly too good with that since it's way too easy to win as the evil (You just have to ""catch"" one person to win while they have to find 10 puddles).

So I was wondering - Are there any more multiplayer horror games (via Hamachi etc) where one player (or maybe multiple..?) is the evil to be defeated?

Note that it doesn't have to be a slender-esque game. It should be something casual that you can just hop in to for an hour and have fun with friends.

1361423543.0	18xrck	Facade	qtw1	29	8	12	So last week a friend of mine sent me an e-mail. He isn’t an online nameless faceless friend or a new friend I don’t know personally that well or some old Chinese man I met at a garage sale or a flea market, I’ve known this guy for fourteen years. I have always considered him someone to trust, so I trusted his message when it said simply, “Play this. The ending, it’s… ugh.” I clicked on the mediafire link in the message and saw a download link titled Façade.rar. I have played Façade before and had some fun swearing at Trip and Grace until I got kicked out or playing along for the nice ending, but I never found an ending that would inspire an “ugh.” I figured I may as well download it. When it finished I had a .rar I opened it with winrar and got a file, inside were three items, an installer, the game application, and a folder titled openlast. Following the instructions I opened the installer, the game installed a usual, and then I opened the game saving the folder for last. The game opened in the usual fashion with the answering machine message playing, but something was different. The voice was not that of Trip. It had a thick southern drawl and sounded unrehearsed and monotone, but still somehow deeply sad even a little drunk maybe. “Hey Jack, It’s Mike, we need to talk.” The screen faded to black as normal and next thing I saw was the door to Trip and Grace’s (Mike and Krissy’s now, I guess) apartment. I walked up to the door and knocked, Mike answered, “Get the fuck in here.” It was Mike’s drawl again I walked into the apartment and I saw Krissy staring at the floor. “I’m gonna ask you this one time, Jack,” the drawl said “have you been sleeping with my wife?”  The voice was so clearly drunk by this point; I could almost smell the alcohol on Mike’s breath through the screen. I typed my response, “no.” I decided to keep it simple until I figured out what the hell was going on. “YOU FUCKER! DON’T YOU FUCKIN’ LIE TO ME YOU PIECE-O-SHIT!! DID YOU FUCK HER!!?” The voice was very angry, it almost seemed to sober up a bit from my answer.  Still the sadness in the voice grew. I decided no was the wrong answer and said, “yes.” I was scared for the response.  He turned to Krissy, “You fuckin whore,” Krissy looked up and he slapped her across the face, I don’t recall that particular animation from playing the game before, “you’re pathetic! I wasn’t good enough?!” at the end of that last sentence I could hear a soft sob through the angry drawl. Mike spoke again facing me “Get out; I need to deal with this.” I recognized the next animation from being kicked out of this apartment several times in the past. I was forced out the door and into the hallway. It was silent and there was nothing left to do but enter the elevator. The screen cuts to black and I hear something awful, BANG thud ….. BANG. Two loud gunshots rang out of my speakers making me jump and the program closed. What the fuck is all I could think. Then I remembered the “open last” file. I opened it and inside there was a jpg and an audio file. I opened the jpg; it was a scanned newspaper clipping about a murder suicide. It told the story of a man who shot his pregnant wife one Saturday evening and turned the gun on himself leaving no note or explanation of any kind for his actions. Then I played the audio file; it seemed to be the same voice actor who played Mike in the game, but less of a drawl and an overall kinder voice. He was completely drunk and crying heavily. “You sonofabitch,” He sobbed. “It’s my fault… all my fault,” a bottle sloshes, “Krissy… our baby… I love you.” … BANG thud.	t5_2tv55	True

1356710485.0	15kra8	Creepy Minecraft glitch (x-post from r/minecraft)	Mrpsychotoaster	34	13	15	This happened to me a while ago and after posting it on /r/Minecraft I got no actual answers. This happened back in an old update when the hunger bar was just introduced and mobs didn't have armor yet. I started my first world and spawned in a plain of grass with a lot of large hills. Even standing on top of these hills I couldn't see much apart from the sea in the distance and a few mountains. I decide to travel for a while before finally making a small house carved into a rock face. Being a noob it didn't take me long to die and without a bed yet I was sent straight back to the spawn. The combination of the landscape and the fact that it was dark creeped me out quite a lot. I got lost and couldn't find my way back to the house I made. While roaming through the hills I came to a kind of bowl shaped valley with hills on each side. I looked along it and at the mobs that were spawning and saw something strange on the other side. There was what I could only describe as an orange thing with the same shape as the snow men you can make. It seemed to have no describable head and was the same texture as the leather in the game. It was moving normally in the way mobs move when they aren't active. I wanted to get closer to whatever it was but before I could get anywhere I was killed by a spider. I was sent straight back to spawn again. After a while of checking the minecraft wiki I realized they never introduced a mob of this description into the game. I have never found any other reports of this glitch before and I have deleted the world since. It kind of reminded me of the Herobrine stories and it creeps me out to play it anymore.	t5_2tv55	True

I feel personally like the first three (Silent Hill 1,2,3) games were the best. They were edgy, kept me engaged and interested, and had a really interesting (if not a little obtuse) storyline and mythos.

However, everything after that (4:The Room, Origins, Homecoming, Shattered Memories) was really not that great. The puzzles were almost nonexsistent, the stories got much too wonky, and the characters were no longer as captivating. While I haven't had a chance to sit down with Downpour yet, I really don't think that it's going to be that great. I would stick the movie in there, just because it was kinda a bastardized first and second game adaptation.

I then downloaded some more songs from bands I like because it was fun, and after playing a couple, not really bothering moving them around, I noticed that in the ""next song"" (not entirely sure what it's called) tab there was a song named something like ""SKR-233-145"". I was kind of baffled, I had made some audio recordings earlier, maybe that was it, so I played it.

It was one minute of weird noises, and a normal Audiosurf stage. Swooshing sounds, backwards noise, kind of like that reverse song of healing except less unsettling. Like if The Beatles did the soundtrack to an alien abduction. It took me off guard, though I finished the level. (on mono, because I'm a wuss)

Nothing paranormal happened, no skeleton popped out, no scary faces hovered around in the level, but I sat in my seat for like two minutes after beating it just confused and creeped out. In hindsight, it's not that scary. It was midnight, and I was tired.

I think it might just have been some sound I was messing around a while ago, or maybe it was just a corrupted file. Still, dammit, that was creepy when it happened!"	t5_2tv55	True

I snuck up behind him and killed him, and he disappeared, thanks to my shadow kill ability. As I looted his room for anything useful, the corpse he was practicing on began jerking back and forth, making noises as if it were still being hit. I was a little disturbed, so I left the room quickly and urned on my night vision. As I left, this weird music started playing. It was slow, with a loud *gong* like a distorted church bell, with ambient music in between each bang. It sounded like the theme music for a chase, but nothing happened. This music continued for the remainder of the level. When I finally (SPOILER ALERT) *got the audio tapes to the station to eliminate the Lord Regent,*(END OF SPOILERS) I couldn't hear his voice over this weird music. I turned the music down in the options, and i played as loud as ever. I swear, this actually happened.

tl;dr Killed torturer, torture victim kept being tortured, ran away, creepy music started playing.

Has this occurred to anyone else...?

EDIT: Also, could anyone help find the music that was playing? I looked up the OST on youtube, and the only songs that *should* have been playing are ""Lord Regent Exploration"" or ""Lord Regent Suspense"", of which it was neither.

Last time I made her play ""Limbo"" and it was good enough since it had this artsy feeling to it too but now I'm out of ideas. Anyone got any other games like that that I could get easily/for free?

Edit: I should also mention that she sucks at gaming so it can't be overly hard."	t5_2tv55	True

The only game I've played which came close to being a decent survivor horror/amusement park game was Illbleed for Dreamcast, but the mechanics were just terrible. Still a fun game though.

Any suggestions?

After watching ""Game of Thrones"" I was in the mood for some Skyrim action.  I have it for the xbox so I put it in and begin a new profile.  I play for a few days and get passed where *spoiler: Skjor gets killed by the Silver Hand.  I take his armor and use it as my own because its free and its the best I have that early in the game.  I did it the first time I played through and figured why not do it again.

A few days and numerous side quests later I was wandering the countryside when I see a naked character headed straight toward me moving straight through trees and terrain as if they weren't there.  I get closer and see that it must be some kind of glitch because the person is half sticking out of the ground with only his torso showing and its head faced upward toward the sky frozen but moving.  Then I realize its Skjor.  I follow him for a while and realize his half naked body is headed back to Whiterun.  I think nothing of it, just a glitch. Later in the game I go back to Jorrvaskr where Skjor is not only alive and naked but still giving me the same lines about proving myself to the Companions.  I look it up and find out its a common glitch with that character but don't really find a specific cause for it.  However what happened next I'm not so sure was a glitch. 

Days later after playing a few hours making iron daggers and increasing my enchantment skill I save while in Winterhold and turn off my xbox and head to bed.  Later that night I wake up to low sounding bass.  I listen for a moment and it sounds like low pounding drums.  At first I thought it was coming from my neighbor upstairs but then recognize its the drums from the main menu of Skyrim.  I figured someone was playing Skyrim late night.  I struggled to get back to sleep and I then hear Skjor's voice talking about how the Dragonborn still has to prove himself.  This time it distinctely sounded like it came from my living room.  So I get up to check it out and see a soft glow on the wall from around the corner from my television.  I turn the corner and see my t.v. not only on but with Skjor standing close to the screen naked staring silently.  My xbox had turned back on and my character had also gone back to Jrrovaskr and was staring at Skjor but it really felt like he was staring at me through the screen.  I moved closer and at first I didn't notice it because I was focused on the screen but as I look pass the soft glow of the television I saw a dark shadowy figure standing in the corner that looked to disappear into the wall as I moved closer.    I don't know if what I saw was real and I don't know how my television turned on or how my character had returned to Jrrovaskr but I turned it off and don't plan on playing Skyrim anytime soon."	t5_2tv55	True

**The Easter Egg:** During a mission called ""Red Lights"", there is a strip-club with two visible windows. Curious teen as I was, I started staring into a window. From what I remember, after a few seconds of looking, the stripper turns into a corpse for a few seconds and a scream is heard.

1334054124.0	s2cw8	"One of ""Blood""'s soundtracks drove me crazy as a teenager"		22	6	11	"Does anyone remember the game called ""Blood""? It was fairly popular in the mid-to-late nineties, surfing on the success of Duke Nukem 3D. It was built on the ""build"" engine, the same one powering the Duke.
But it was conceivably much more intricate, despite the similar technology.

My teenage mind was too small to contain everything the game threw at me at the time, yet I managed to play and even complete it. Only afterwards would I realize that not everything in that game ""belonged"". Allow me to elaborate.

The first time I came into contact with the game was through a demo. This demo was distributed as most demos were in that time: through a CD which came with a then-popular gaming magazine. The internet existed but was unfortunately unavailable to me because of the costs.

I happily played through the demo, which was the entire first of three or four chapters of the game. The game started with your character rising from the dead in a shallow grave then fighting his way through several levels in search of his comrades, the ""chosen"". The entire game was chock full of everything even remotely morbid, which created a somewhat comical effect rather than a scary one. And this, too, was intentional because (dark) humour was on of the game's cornerstones. After playing the demo, I found a full version in a store that didn't normally carry videogames, which was strange in itself. I couldn't resist bringing it home with me though.

One thing that wasn't comical or dainty at all, however, was the game's soundtrack. During the game, the music would only play if you had inserted the CD (this was long before terabyte-sized harddisks) and even then only at specific points and for short periods of time. While playing, you were easily distracted by the gameplay itself and the sounds of the fighting - gunshots, shrieks, zombies yelling...

But once you inserted the CD into a CD-player, or opened it up with wmplayer... that was another story. One of the tracks was several tens of minutes long and consisted of nothing but incredibly terrifying background sounds, coupled with hushed whispering and sporadically demonic chanting. None of this ever prominently appeared in the actual game. 
This claim is easily verifiable for anyone who owns the original CD-ROM of the game. I lost mine during a move, but I'm sure someone should be able to find and upload what I'm talking about.

The reason this music is relevant to this subreddit and not just a casual mention of something scary, is that in subsequent versions of the game that I managed to pick up, I never found this soundtrack again. It just wasn't there and I never found any mention of it either. It's as if it was only included in the very first versions of the game that were boxed and shipped, and then cut out.
This isn't necessarily paranormal nor a conspiracy - in that day and age, many games were stripped of their soundtracks and cinematics in order to be re-released by newsgroups and hackers, so they could fit more content on a CD-ROM. But coupled with the extreme uneasiness one would experience while listening to this ""music"" may make this a worthy target for creepygaming to investigate.

I could go on and write a pasta about how the music turns you insane etc... but I won't, because it's not necessary. I dare anyone to listen to it for 10 minutes straight if the music is found, you'll know what I'm talking about.
Just be somewhat prepared and don't say you weren't warned.

Until today I have never in my life heard anything remotely as terrifying qualifying as ""music""."	t5_2tv55	True

Despite it being obvious it was Metal Gear related I thought it would work really well as a horror game. It could have been the same idea;

* Recovering from some terrible injury in a hospital, limiting movement and physical abilities. (Maybe you would recover with time throughout the story)
* Limited supplies, possibly finding guns but with extremely limited ammo, forcing you to save it until you absolutely need it. Maybe to deter an enemy long enough to escape or hide. No health indicators, realistic amount of damage similar to how it works in the Siren games.
* Mysterious and extremely oppressive enemies, maybe unkillable, forcing stealth and thinking about best actions to get passed them (like the tough decision to use your limited ammo).
* Mysterious story, as you piece together what happened, maybe he died and this is punishment, or maybe it's a coma or maybe it's simply a strange and horrifying place.

So, despite being a huge MGS fan and really looking forward to MGS5, I still really want this type of horror game and am a little disappointed that it's not."	t5_2tv55	True

We hopped on NZ 28 and got started trying to locate each other. My friend still had a Bizon and a 50.cal sniper rifle. While I was searching Bolota military base, he started saying he was getting creeped out by this thing he was seeing. He wasn't telling me much, so I kept promoting him for answers. Finally he told me he was being chased by a floating flare that was playing creepy music and saying/whispering and screaming at him. Normally the screams were children or women, he said. The flare chased him for kilometres, and kept teleporting around him as if he was being herded. He tried to shoot it, although nothing seemed to harm it. The flare then dissipated 100-150 m from the Prigo bridge, him having run from the outskirts of Electrom, and then he heard a woman singing. The women then apparently got closer and closer (Music got louder) until she screamed and the voice clip cut out. Then, 50 zombies in blood splattered lab coats sprinted towards him. He fell off the bridge and got killed, being eaten by the zombies. When he pressed escape, he was faced with a black screen with only the words ""NO QUITTING"" implanted on it, rendering him unable to re spawn or do any other action. My first instinct was that it was obviously the work of hackers. However, once he'd been killed, it started by me.

The sound of a flare popping crackled close as I searched for loot in one of the towers in Bolota military base. I welcomed the light for a second, before thinking that it was a hostile getting ready to take me out. Then, strange chanting and a girl counting weirdly started. I quickly Alt-tabbed to pull out fraps once I'd descended the ladder, however, it crashed the first attempt so I had to alt tab again to start recording.

Suddenly, I saw something beneath a tree far away moving, and took out my binoculars to see what it was (sometimes, enemies randomly get to you with their cars in that game) but I saw that it only was a cow, so I thought I'd be fine. I walked on, when suddenly my protagonist got a malaria occuring. When that happens, the view get's blurry and greenly- tinted and he looks down at the ground, until you take a pill. So I pressed on the take a pill- button, and the guy took a pill, stood up again and still had the blurry view for a little time. In that time, I saw lights approaching, and freaked the fuck out. I heard shots, the guy tingled around, and when his view got clear, a fucking enemy car was 10 meters in front of me, about to hit me. And what was in front of it? The COW. It sticked to the front of the car and peacefully moo-ed, as if nothing happened. Anyway, I jumped like crazy, tried to get away, but the car hit me and I died. One of the most scary things that happened to me in a game, only because of that damn malaria occuring.

So, me and my friend were in creative mode and we'd just finished building a large castle with a couple of other connected structures. I'll start off by listing the things that will be relevant later. Firstly, there were some skeleton skulls above the entrance to a room. Two black skulls and two white ones. Secondly, I had placed a Steve head on a bridge that lead to one of the other relevant rooms. The Steve head was sort of peeking around the corner at the player when they start the walk on the bridge. Next, we have some random Steve heads that I placed on the floor as a joke. Lastly we have the room in which the bridge leads to. Inside the room, there are three Steve heads, each next to a sign with a reference to the merchant from Resident Evil 4.

So, let's begin with the story. The occurrences began after I made a small circle of Steve heads outside (Yes, I was obsessed with Steve heads at the time). Here's what it looked liked: http://i.imgur.com/2U42M.png
Anyway, after I made that, the first thing happened. I went back into the castle and the four skulls above the entrance had changed. Three white heads now and only one black. Of course, this isn't creepy and I didn't think anything of it at the time. 

I then went up to the bridge and saw that my Steve head had been replaced with a skull head. Instead of peeking around the corner, the skull stared straight into the wall. This is when I started getting creeped out. I asked my friend about it, but he swore he didn't do it. I was sceptical at first, but a later occurrence made me believe that it wasn't him. But before that, I went back downstairs and noticed that the randomly placed Steve heads in which I had placed earlier were now mixed in with white skull heads. My friend also swore he hadn't done that too.

Now for the final thing. Some signs around the castle started turning blank for no reason. We went to the ""merchant room"". My friend suddenly told me that to him one of the Steve heads next to the sign looked like the white skulls. I was immidietly freaked out, even though it still looked like a Steve head to me. I know it's not much proof for you readers, but - while I was still watching - he sent me this screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/0xtME.png
The fact that he was really freaking out told me this wasn't his doing. He told me to stand next to it as proof and then sent me this screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/Tn3Jr.png (That's me standing next to the skull). After seeing this, I got scared. Why did it still look like a Steve head to me? I then made him stand next to it and I took a screenshot of my own: http://i.imgur.com/jTCNt.png (that's my friend next to the skull).
I know this is no proof to readers, because we could've easily changed the head ourselves, but you'll have to take our word for it. We swear this happened.

Anyway, that's what happened. We then left the area and made new houses elsewhere. I understand this isn't THAT creepy, especially to readers, but at the time we were terrified. This probably won't be too popular, but I just thought i'd share it with you guys. "	t5_2tv55	True

I don't remember the events leading up to how I got to playing the game... but I remember playing out in a field. It wasn't Hyrule Field or Termania. What I was playing didn't represent any of the games at all; although the Link in my nightmare was the same as Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. There wasn't any background details, everything was dark except for a small vicinity of where I was walking. I had been avoiding enemies, as they had not attacked when I got close. All of a sudden one of those beetles that charge when you get close... (I believe they are called hiploops?) came running towards me. Natural reaction is to swing my sword at it. When I hit it, it burst into flames, and a second Link appeared. There was nothing different about him, it was an exact duplicate of me. I thought maybe the game in my dream had glitched... until the second Link decided to take a swing at my Link and killed me. So the game gives the usual ""Game Over"" music and screen; but no option to continue playing. The screen flashed for a second and then went black. It came back up with the ""Dawn of the First Day"" screen, which was odd because this wasn't Majora's Mask. It went to the unknown field where Link was just standing there, but there was no action buttons on the screen and I couldn't control him. Link started to flash... the background was still. He turned black; similar to Dark Link. It had the glowing red eyes, too. This was slightly different though... because Link was still a child, so was this Dark Link. This Link also had a disturbingly happy grin on it's face, lined with massive fangs. It turned around for a second, and the triforce on the shield was upside down; and the same glowing red as Link's eyes. It turned back around and the camera panned up above this Link, but not so far up that I could still see his creepy face. He started running towards the bottom of the screen in this field, and kept going. Eventually the screen faded, similar to when Link changes a location. It came back, and he was running on a bridge. The water around the bridge was choppy and moving rapidly, so when I saw what I saw next, I had to look twice. It was an unfinished model of Princess Zelda; standing in the similar stance of the princess from The Princess creepypasta. She had no eyes, and she seemed to be floating. I didn't see it for long though, since the camera was focused on Link and still following his running; after he has passed Zelda he drew his sword. I felt like he was running at me, ready to attack. At this point in nightmare-land, I'm freaking out. I turned the T.V off... and then unplugged the console. The last thing I remember from this nightmare was looking back up at the screen, and seeing the glowing eyes and the smile with the fangs.

I woke up freaking out, and didn't go back to sleep. I have no idea how my brain concocted such a freaky dream. :/

Anyone diving into creepypastas will probably, at some point, end on one related to polybius. For anyone here who does not know what polybius is, to make a long story short it's a mysterious arcade cabinet that appeared in Portland, Or. It had many stories surrounding it, most being conspiracy theories. It apparently disappeared after a short run in some obscure arcade. Here is a [link.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_\(video_game\)) Now, to get more to the point, whenever I hear of that arcade game I get this overwhelming feeling that I've seen it in person before. I don't live very far from Portland (few hours away) so it adds a little more depth to my claim. Polybius seems so familiar when I think about it. I have done some research, and found a website claiming that it was possibly a puzzle game, or a top view shooter.The shooter theory, to me, seems a lot more probable. Plus, me being a kid, I usually stayed away from puzzle games. I have been to a few arcades, small ones, that have now been long closed down, but can't quite put my finger on one in particular.  I guess I just want reassurance, something, if anything, or anyone can give me their story? 	t5_2tv55	True

1349673962.0	114i6s	Ultima IX Lights Out	ReleeSquirrel	15	5	1	"So I saw a link to this subreddit on the List of Good Horror Games crosspost and thought I'd see if anybody else had this happen to them.

Ultima IX was kind of a travesty; I never actually finished it but I did get a good ways in; in fact I played it a second time and this happened both times, on different installs. I'm curious if it happened to anyone else; if it happens to everyone else and it's just a big bug in the game.

So here it is. After you find the exit to the Hythloth dungeon, you come out at the Shrine of Humility on Magincia. When you activate the shrine it seems like normal, but after the special effects, THE SUN GOES OUT.

All of a sudden there's no ambient lighting or anything in the world; you can hold a torch or cast the light spell but that's it. There aren't even any stars or a moon; the sky is black.

I found that in order to fix it, I had to trek all the way to Katrina's dome at the top of Magincia and sleep in her bed. After you've slept long enough the day night cycle switches and it fixes itself. But it's definately the scariest thing that's ever happened to me in a non-horror game.

Did it happen to you?"	t5_2tv55	True
1349216928.0	10uavm	Dark Souls &amp; Eerie dream	Mrpyramidhead	17	9	5	"Just thought I'd tell you guys about something I experienced a few days ago.

Those of you who've played Dark Souls know that in the duke's archive, after you try to beat the boss for the first time, you wake up in this huge cylinder shaped chamber, and after a while of being there the enemies start a gramophone that plays this music:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXt6hMzu8do

The minute I heard this it really made me start philosophizing about the dark souls lore, and real life philosophy too. It had a kind of special mystery feel to it.

That night, I had a dream about being in that same chamber, only it wasn't as a player, but as me, in the actual room. It looked exacly the same and the music was playing in the dream too. One of those silly dancing channelers (mage enemy in DS) came up to me and started talking. He that this room, and rooms below it, are part of ""sacred geometry"" that in use with that sound, would create some kind of pattern. He said that I couldn't talk to anyone about this when I woke up (and that really freaked me out). 

He then snapped his fingers and teleported me to the big middle chamber in dark Anor Londo, where it looked like a couple of players were waiting for me (I assumed it was PVP because there are only supposed to be giants and a dark knight in that chamber). When I approached them I noticed they were completely still, and didn't even seem to notice I was there. I tried hitting them but my swings went right through. After a while all of their eyes turned red, and I went into that state in dreams where your eyes are wide open and all you feel is absolute fear. That woke me up. 

I keep thinking this has some deep meaning but it was obviously just a dream. And yes, I know this isn't something that happened in a game, but I figured it would fit here anyway."	t5_2tv55	True

It's a 2D game, and it looks like a RPG Maker-style game. You play as a girl, and you walk around a mansion where you have to avoid giant monsters that take up the screen. You search for clues, which take the form of creepy pictures, and the imagery gets more disturbing as you progress. 

You eventually end up in a basement which is jam packed with a ton of unmoving monsters, and you retrieve an item, which causes a giant fleshy statue to start chasing you around the mansion. You run out of the mansion, and end up in a really foggy forest. In the forest, the only way to go is north... and I didn't manage to play the rest of the game.

There was nothing, ''Just me and the game'', I thought. But I was wrong, very wrong. I checked the playerlist, there was someone else on my team called ''Explorer''. It was strange, because I remembered the bots having random First and Last names. ''Maybe I accidentally made a public server.'' I thought to myself, so I just tried to chat with him.

1334359935.0	s8qub	My experience with The Legend of Zelda: Links Awakening	DaFitz	25	17	10	"When I was young I had a Gameboy color. On this Gameboy color I inherited many games from my older cousin. In addition to pokemon red and blue, I received The Legend of Zelda: Links Awakening. I liked this game a lot until one traumatic experience made me hate the Zelda series forever.

I was playing the game and was in the central hub of the game, (at least it was for me at the time), the town you wake up in. I had recently had a lot of fun with bombs but I really needed a shovel to continue the game which required a steep 200 rupees. I had tried walking out of the store with bombs without paying for them and received the message ""Hey, you have to pay for that!."" So I did. I grabbed the shovel and tried the same thing and was surprised to find that I had walked out the door and received the message ""You got something for free. Cool!"" and so I walked about digging in the spot I was supposed to and pretty much everywhere else, soon played long into the night. Turning on all the lights in my house, because I was around six.
I had run out of those bombs I loved so much, so naturally I ran back to the source in the shop. What I found shocked me. All of the merchandise had been taken down, the lights where very dim, and the shopkeep was in the middle of the floor rocking back and forth. When I came in I was unable to move no matter how I moved the arrows or mashed the buttons. He faced me and launched continuous red lightening at me until I was out of hearts. As soon as my last heart was gone, A new death animation happened. Instead of spinning around until he fell over, link spun to look at the screen and sort of exploded. Red pixels splashed off of him, revealing gray bones which crumbled. 
As soon as the last bone hit the ground, the gameboy, along with every light in my house, shut off.
Weeks later I asked my cousin about what happened in Zelda, he cut me off and said ""I never gave you Zelda"" I kept pressuring him and he eventually hurried me out of his room assuring me he never gave me Zelda, slamming the door behind me.
I haven't brought it up since, although even though I lost the gameboy, I still have the Links Awakening Cartridge. It Inspires feelings of Fear and Resentment in me whenever I look upon it."	t5_2tv55	True

About 5 years prior to the events I'm about to describe, I took a job as a store clerk at best buy.
My job was to stock the shelves with games, and I enjoyed this because I got major nostalgia waves from
seeing the old games I had to stock. On July 7th, 2010, I got up and started getting ready for work.
I got in my car, and drove to work. When I got there, my manager greeted me and told me there
was a batch of used games to stock on the shelves in the used game category. 

Most of the games were GBA games, but there were a few DS titles and two N64 cartidges, which were Mario Kart and
Banjo Kazooie. As I started sorting the games on the shelves I again felt the nostalgia of seeing old games,
especially with Banjo Kazooie. At the bottom of the pile I spotted something unusual, an old gameboy game: Metroid 2.
I was curious, as I had never played this game. I was also surprised because this was a really old game, and I was
pretty sure no-one would want it so I put it at the back of the shelf.

A few months later, I had completely forgotten about it until I noticed it, at the back of the shelf, right where 
I had put it. Alot of the games around it had been bought, but for some reason people didn't want it. I assumed
this was because it was for the original gameboy and most people don't have those. Except me. My curiosity spiking,
I took the game off the shelf and took it to the back of the store, where I showed my manager. He said he didn't remember 
the game, and that I could have it since it hadn't sold. I thanked him and pocketed the cartridge. Feeling happy, I returned to my shift
and finished up work.



11:07 PM, Friday

By the time I got back to my house, (I had gone for a few drinks with my friends after work.) I was feeling tired
and had had several drinks. I flopped down on the couch, and, remembering the gameboy game, I pulled it out of my pocket.
I left it on the table, and walked down the hall to the ladder to my attic. I pulled down the trapdoor and climbed up.
Rummaging through the contents of the attic, I found a box which had my old NES in it, and above it: My old gameboy.

I walked back downstairs, plugged the cartridge in, and started it up. The game screen came up, with a normal title
and dull background music. I pressed start and selected save 1, then started it. It turned out there was already a save on that slot,
no doubt from the previous owner. At first the save started up normally, with music playing and graphics fully loaded, except for one thing.
Samus was missing from the screen, and the camera was focused on thin air. 
It was a bit wierd, and I grew worried that maybe the cartridge was corrupted. Then Samus appeared. She was stuck in the wall to the right of
the camera, and her health was draining rapidly.

Before I could do anything, Samus's health drained completely and Samus disintegrated. Then the game crashed. I restarted the gameboy,
and the game started up normally. I selected save 1 again, but this time I cleared the data and then started it. Samus appeared at her spaceship,
strangely enough I had one energy tank and the plasma beam. I assumed the plasma beam was the beam you started with in the game,
having never played it before. The game proceeded normally, and I had been playing for a good half hour when the game crashed completely unexpectedly. 
""Crap!"" I exclaimed, restarting the gameboy in frustration. The game took a lot longer to load this time, and I was definitely starting to think
that the game cartridge was corrupted. Suddenly the start menu loaded, and the game emitted a loud screeching noise.
I started, then proceeded to launch the game on save 1 and the screeching stopped. 

I was pretty sure that the cartridge was just broken, and considered just throwing it away. The game loaded, and I had lost all my progress.
I was back at the spaceship, and I didn't have any energy tanks or weapons, and I couldn't use the morph ball. The metroid counter was also at 0.
I decided to try playing again, but I couldn't move Samus. Instead, she crouched and the music stopped. It was eerie. Suddenly the game started screaming,
and Samus's arms exploded into blood. And it was red. Blood was pouring everywhere. I was shocked. I couldn't believe it, it was impossible for the
game to have color. After a few more seconds Samus appeared on the floor, dead. No more blood, just her eerie body. The music resumed, but it was different.
It sounded twisted, demonic. After a few more seconds in which I tried to turn the power off to no avail, Samus appeared again.
She was standing over the body of Samus, and she was in full color. She turned and ran off the screen to the right. The screen suddenly flashed up a picture.

It was samus, looking straight at me, with her visor removed. Her eye sockets were empty, as if looking into the void. Text appeared: ""I am Aran. Forgotten, 
but not alone. At least I have YOU!"" The game flashed between the picture and red. I screamed and dropped the gameboy. My clock struck midnight. I ran towards
my kitchen, but blacked out at the doorway.

---------------------------

When I woke up, I was in my bed, staring up at the ceiling. I sat up, and looking at my bedside table, saw my gameboy and the cartridge. The cartridge was smashed,
like it was hit with a sledgehammer. The game title was busted up, and now just read: ""Metroid 2: Return"" I took the cartridge, walked outside, and chucked it in my garbage bin.
I quit my job at Best Buy, and tried to forget about the game. I still get nightmares though....

1375254826.0	1jeot9	My mini-review of The Crooked Man (minor spoilers inside)	youre_not_real	6	3	1	"I just finished The Crooked Man, and so I thought I'd write a mini-review of this game just for fun. I tried to keep the spoilers to a minimum (but definitely don't read if you want to play this game knowing nothing).

I found out about The Crooked Man from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepygaming/comments/1h0fs3/the_crooked_man_awesome_ao_oni_style_horror_game/). The title of said post mentioned that the game is similar to Ao Oni, which is a game I thoroughly enjoyed.

**Graphics:** TCM looks like it came straight out of the SNES era, which appeals to me as an avid retro gamer. Dimly lit scenery provided a constant foreboding atmosphere, which made me feel quite uneasy at times. Anime-style (?) cutscenes brought the pixeled characters to life, which was a welcome distraction from wading through paragraphs of dialogue. 7/10

**Puzzles:** The puzzles are not terribly difficult. There were a few times where I had to jot a few notes down on a sticky note, but that was about it. Most of the puzzles are well thought out, logically speaking, so if you take a minute to think about how to do something, you'll be rewarded. I got stuck maybe once or twice. On those occasions, the [walkthrough](http://www.vgperson.com/games/crookedman.htm) was helpful. 8/10

**Scariness:** One of this game's strongest facets was its ability to instill a sense of uneasiness in the player. I was never sure if any of my actions were going to trigger an unwelcoming (or disturbing) event (granted, that's probably the goal of every horror game). There were even times that I got scared when it was hardly even a scary moment at all. I actually quit the game outright at one point. I literally could not go on - not because something was about to happen, but because I had braced myself for so long for *something* to happen, so I had to take a break. There are a few jump scares, but they are used sparingly. There are a few situations in the game that actually cause the entire atmosphere of the game to boil away, IMO. I'm talking about [the times when you have to fight and classical music plays in the background.](/spoiler) During those times, I was almost completely taken out of the game's world. A bit of a drawback, but all in all, the game is pretty thrilling. 7/10

**** (VERY MINOR) SPOILER ALERT BELOW****

One of the downsides of TCM (in my opinion) is [the amount of time it takes to inspect each and every room on every floor. On one hand, inspecting every nook and cranny adds to the tension and mystery. But on the other hand, you'll be finding a plethora of empty drawers, doors that can never be opened, and objects that simply can't be inspected. Plus, it was a bit annoying to have to run up and down multiple floors in search of the next unlockable door. For comparison, I think Ao Oni (v. 6.23) did a better level design work than TCM, simply because you didn't have to waste 5 minutes going through the wrong hallway unnecessarily. -3 coolness points](/spoiler)

**** END (VERY MINOR) SPOILER ALERT ABOVE****

**Last Comments:** This was definitely a game that was worth playing. Although I didn't go into it here, I enjoyed the story and its characters. Not sure if it merits a replay, due to its length and scripted events. Overall, this was a well done game that any horror game fan should check out.

Ok so heres how it all starts. I Download an illegal copy of San Andreas off a torrenting website. After installing all goes smooth, except for the fact that theres no sound, The radio stations dont work. It wasnt a big deal for me because i turn them off either way. Made my life a bit easier. Another thing i noticed was my position..
   
I opened up the save file 1. And i spawn next to that famous muddy lake. (i cant find a picture ill look for one later) So I dont think much of it and look online for some sort of vehicle cheat to get out of there. I type it in and it doesnt accept it. I try it several times to no avail.
    
I finally decide to walk out of there and onto a road to steal a car and go to Grove Street. When i get to a main road i see no cars anywhere. Not a single person either. Im a bit creeped out at this point. so i start running on the road and the first thing i hear is footsteps. I hear my own footsteps and another too. I heard the overlapping of the footsteps. I heard mine then another immediately after. I turn around and dont see anything. It was easy to hear due to the lack of music or cars engines in traffic.
    
I run all the way down a road, with the constant footsteps behind me. I stop, and so do the footsteps. I thought it was an audio glitch because there are so many things off with this copy of the game. I thought nothing of it. 

I open up my map to set the waypoint for Grove Street, and i notice the map is dull, everything is not colored right, what used to be a nice dark green is now a dull mint green color. Yet again, Glitch right ? i close my map after setting the waypoint and as soon as i close the map, the worst, most horrifying scream ever, a female scream loud as hell followed by running footsteps. But nobodys around me. Thats when shit (pardon my language) gets scary, the continuous screaming, i heard it three times, then complete silence for a few seconds. I lowered my volume and ran from that area, by now im by the Balla's hood. Almost to Grove. When i got to Grove there was a sudden sense of security because i saw some other gangmembers, but they were just standing there, motionless.
      
I go into the Johnsons house to see if the weapons were in the kitchen. But no weapons. So i go outside and i nearly shit my pants. The game starts lagging like hell, and all around the hood, There are dead Gang Members, From all gangs, Mexicans, Ballas, OGF, all. Dead and i hear a low humming now, i turn my volume up and it gets louder, so i lower it to the point where i can barely hear it. I go back inside and outside again, and everything is gone. Nobody is at Grove now, not even the motionless gang members that were standing there. *Ring Ring* my phone rings, but instead of the[Y - Pick Up, N- Hang Up] dialogue box that pops up, only [Y - Pick Up] shows up, so i do what i have to , i press Y. As soon as the animation is over, i hear low breathing. Ive heard of those strange phone call glitches, but i knew this was something else.
      
When i hear  that i hang up immediately, then i close the window, but this is where i got really creeped out, i couldnt close it, it gave me a 'Grand Theft Auto: San andreas (not responding)' window (BTW im on Windows 7)   I close my laptop and turn it off. i boot it back up and i still hate Windows for this, instead of it booting up fresh, it did windows resume. Goddamn it, why did it do that ? As soon as i enter my password i see Carl dead. But instead of it saying 'wasted' it says ""It got you..."" Carl stands back up and im shitting myself right now.
      
I finally CTRL-ALT-DELETE, and close that game, to this day i havent regained the balls to boot the game back up. Ill try to provide a DownLoad Link, But be careful, i wouldnt reccomend it."	t5_2tv55	True

**The Story**

Shady Palms Resort, sun, sand, water, death. It was closed in 1975 after a massacre where an employee at the resort lost his mind and killed all the staff on duty and three fourths of the residents before killing himself. Shady Palms is said to be haunted by the ghost of the killer and the residents and staff that he murdered. But there’s more to the story than that. Interest in the abandoned location started popping up after an urban explorer wrote a post about the resort on his blog. He reported that he heard the ghosts of the residents and staff, was threatened the ghost of the killer, and saw the blood stained hotel rooms. But he also reported locked and bolted doors that seemed to be untouched and strange messages written on the walls of the killer’s former office. The most frightening and interesting find of all, though, was several children that would appear in doorways he had just gone through, and at the end of hallways he was walking down. He stated that the children would stare at him for a few seconds, and then disappear. Photos of the children that he had taken and uploaded were revealed to be corrupted and glitched to the point where you couldn’t tell what the photo was supposed to be of. He also stated that he would hear the children whispering to him “Help. Help us.” He also heard the children walking around the hallways he had just gone through and calling out “Daddy?”

You have decided to explore the resort, find these children, and hopefully cleanse the building of the evil within. But as you explore the resort, talk to ghosts, and avoid danger you find out things about Shady Palms that you rather would live without knowing.

Later on this week I might make a page on this and post the link. Until then, feel free to ask questions and give suggestions.

I write this as a broken man. A horrible act was committed, and the shadows in my closest are going to drive me insane. Give me a few minutes of your time, and allow me to present to you, the pain that haunts me.


It was a love-hate relationship between me and my assistant. We are both recognized by the state as doctors of science. We practice a wide range of studies. Our methods differ, usually to the point of arguments erupting into fierce competition. He was a good man though; he and I would change the world. Our competition, our bond, it was strong. Our work was our first priority for a long time. We would slave day after day, night after night. I push myself to the brink of insanity coming up with the most complicated schematics, mapping brain functions, creating power cells, working with various metals and compounds. My partner would draw up plans and gather materials. I would never say that he is beneath me, but there was a reason he was my assistant and not a co-worker. This would be why the events unfolded in such a way, to destroy my son and drive me to madness. 


I cried tears of joy the day my Son was born. Work was set aside as I played the role of father (and mother). He was a miracle, I held him, and fed him. I built him a great room full of toys and things for him to play with. I taught him everything I could think of. I trained him in seeking knowledge. For weeks after he was born, I would walk with him around our house, and show him books to read, and explain things about the outside world. I was so naïve. For all the book smarts I had accumulated, I knew nothing of the real world. The monsters in the wilderness were nothing compared to the one lurking in my laboratory. If I had only realized, the greatest threat to me was wearing a lab coat and pretending to be my assistant.

   
It didn’t take long to find out there were serious problems with my Son. He was having problems with his heart, and I for one considered every surgery I could think of to make him better. Upon the thought of his body being changed, he refused. Being so very independent, he said no. My son told me that he did not want to be saved. I cried and stomped my foot as he opened the door and walked out of his home. I fell to pieces on the living room floor, and my wretched assistant approached me and put his dark scheming hands on my back in a comforting manner. He told me he would find my son, and bring him home. I was relieved, knowing he was on my side. I watched him run after my beloved child and had no idea that he was going to stab me in the back with this very act.


He died in my assistants arms. That’s what he wants me to think. I know better now. I was so stupid when he told me. Depression and longing blinded me from the truth. He was smirking. I couldn’t see it. My assistant was a ruthless liar. He told me that he found my son, dying in a field. He said that he wanted his father to know that he loved him. My assistant was the most disgusting and disturbed individual I have ever associated with. He cooked up the whole thing in an effort to make me do what I did. He used me, like a toy. I hate him. I hate him. I hate him. I hate him. I hate him. I hate him. I want to go back in time, and put a bullet in his head. He is why my son is an abomination, and my first born is dead.


I was determined. This time I won’t screw up the heart. My assistant worked diligently with our current projects. Directors of major companies were calling, people wanted their products. I had other plans though. Most of my designs were complete; it was up to the assistant to put them together. This was another vital mistake I made. The Monster in the laboratory was slowly infecting my work. I slowly created my next crowning achievement. I had a Son again. He opened his eyes, and my heart was whole again. He was so much better. He was less independent (although I kept that part of my other boy), he was kind and helpful. I was on such a roll; I even started working on a little girl. I was proud of myself again, and nothing would stop me. How could I have been so delusional? The Monster was getting ready to make his move. I would never be so devastated in my life. This would be the end of me. That arrogant prick of a human, scum of the earth, would cause me to do something that I would rather commit suicide than remember.
I watched him take my projects. He laughed at me, sabotaged the laboratory, he and my dead Son walked out of my broken laboratory, stealing every project, their schematics, every shred of evidence that any of it came from my genius. I was powerless to stop them. The monster ripped everything I own, everything I love, almost.
 

I still had him. My new Son is still with me. I knew what I had to do. The only thing I could do. I needed those projects back. I needed my life back. I felt like my whole world had collapsed. I spent my time working with these pathetic kids and missed the obvious signs that my fake assistant was going to ruin me. I grabbed my Son. I put him on the table. He was scared. He was crying. I grabbed a saw and a screwdriver. I started work. 


It’s my hope. You will become what I need you to be. You will give me my life back. I entrust this task to you, I know you can do it. You have to. You have no choice. You will become what I need you to be. It’s my only hope. 


While he was screaming, I mutilated him. I added armor, I gave him a bigger power source, I added weapons and a powerful helmet was screwed onto his skull.


I will name him Megaman...

The pasta was something like the writer started up a new world and built his house, and there was a hilltop right near him with a cave entrance. Something to do with leaving redstone on the walls, and the creature I believe was red as well. I always pictures the monster as like a creeper with the redstone block textures (before redstone blocks were even created). Hope this isn't too vague, but it's been a long time. 	t5_2tv55	True

1368991508.0	1en9v9	Shadow of the Colossus glitch	SirKnightly	5	5	0	"I've got a long history of encountering glitches in games, but they've always been funny or frustrating; never creepy like this one.


I was reading a thread yesterday which made me nostalgic for Shadow of the Colossus, so I decided to replay it and actually try for some of the unlockables. I started a new game on hard mode and went on to defeat the first colossus. Realizing that these fights were indeed going to be difficult, I decided to explore for fruits and lizards to raise my stats.

I wandered the map for probably 2 hours, eventually reaching the area called Green Cape. This whole time I had barely been riding Aggro, choosing to run instead as it allowed me to examine the landscape more closely. Because of this, I didn't immediately notice that she had disappeared while I was searching the cliff sides for lizards. 

I figured she had glitched and knew she'd respawn next to me when I loaded up my game, so I didn't really care about it and just continued on my search. I did whistle for her a few times though, just to see if she'd unstick herself from wherever she was.

At this point, I came across a cave which I realized led into a later colossus's area. There was a pretty lake and a temple in the sun which I entered and was met with a closed door. I backtracked out of the area to look for more stat increases, and that's when it happened.

The cave entrance which I had previously gone through was now a giant, pure white glow. I couldn't see anything in the solid light. I was afraid of encountering it and potentially falling off the map, but I noticed a regular lizard crawl through just fine so I walked straight into it. 

As expected, things were glitchy. Although the ground was solid, it was invisible. Everything around me was light grey and the bloom was still pretty intense. When I looked back at where I had just stepped from I could see the map below, with little odds and ends floating in grey space. It looked a bit like the animus loading area in Assassin's Creed. 

Then I turned around again.

Aggro had loaded, *on her side*, in front of me. It was the position you see for a brief while whenever you'd launch her off a cliff and she'd tumble to the earth. She floated above the ""ground"" roughly above the height of Wander's head. 

A little bit later the landscape around us loaded, the white light vanishing, but Aggro remained floating above me. She didn't move an inch. Nor did she respond to my calls or whistles. I was freaked out so I ran to the nearest save point and reloaded, and was relieved to see her spawn healthy and new again. I gave her a few pats on the side and rode her around for a bit before deciding to shut off the game.

Was probably one of the weirdest glitches I've encountered. It was as if Aggro was upset that I'd abandoned her.

This is only my second pasta, so don't expect it to be too special.====

Pokemon isn't the only game that resolved around the characters being named off of colors. Take Gunstar heroes and Gunstar Suped Heroes for example. It was really fun. I loved it a ton. I never got into the original game because of how hard it was, but that didn't make it a bad game. I just liked the sequel more.
	
Just the other day I attempted to replay  Gunstar Super Heroes. I heard the lovely snap of the game and the on button, and the memories of my favorite moments with this game came back. The game was different this time, though. It simply a would not work. I looked at the disc, and I noticed the plastic on the game cartridge was broken. Then the memories flowed back from my childhood. I always got a bit too mad and overreacted, and I bit the game to save me from the  frustrating difficulty of the game. God, I was stupid. 

	I went to the lovely world of interwebz and typed "" Is there a third game in the Gunstar series?"" My finger slammed on the enter key and I clicked on the nearest Yahoo! Answers link. I always find it reliable. I'd sit here and tell you why, but I am not here to brag about Yahoo!. Anyways, the top answer was ""No."", but there was somebody claiming to have at one point worked for Sega on a Gunstar three. He said it got bagged do to poor sales despite their positive ratings, but he has a copy of a beta on a disc for the GameCube. His English seemed to be a little bit off, so it seemed possible. I looked at the user's account and got the usual message when somebody is banned. 

	eBay was my next option. Personally, my opinion says that eBay sucks, so I changed my next option to my last option. Curious, I googled who the guy was. I forgot his name now, most likely because he preferred to to be called ""Majin."" I figured he adopted this from the Sonic CD soundtrack thing. Google found his Facebook, and I started my stalkerish browsing. I finally decided to contact this guy and ask him if I could have a copy of the Beta. 
	
He said no. My heart deflated. Just then AVG said it found a malware on my computer. I looked and saw that I already had a copy of Gunstars 3 on my computer. I was very skeptical about this, especially after I noticed my webcam's recording light on. Was this thing always on? 
I then checked my Facebook messages and received an ""XD LOL"" out of him. He said that he was just joking around and that I could have it. I unplugged my webcam and closed the tabs I had running, but I left AVG on. A false feel of security, I guess.  I clicked on the little Windows 7 icon on the bottom left screen. I entered the word ""Keylog"" and found one result. I clicked on it to see if I could shut it off. It opened a winRAR file. It had a readme, which I clicked in. The other file contained something called ""Gunstar Anti Heroes"". The readme said, ""Don't be scared buddy. I'll remove the Keylog. There was just no other way to give it to you without everybody else in SEGA knowing. I want to remodel everything and name it something else, but first I need a tester. That is where you will help me. I give you the game you want, I get to make the game I want.""
	This was a creepy thing to say, but I didn't question it. This whole thing was a bit shady.  I plugged my webcam back in and saw it was recording again. 

	""Can you see me?"" I questioned. I received no answer. I asked again. No answer. I unplugged the camera again, and booted up the software without closing the readme. 

	The game started off with a story, much like the GBA version. It is here I would like to confess I never finished Gunstar Super Heroes. You may have assumed it by the fact I never played it much, but I'm confirming your assumptions here. 

	""After Blue and Red's perils, they eventually became successful. Blue and Red became a king and a queen, figuratively, of course. They became richer than most people's hearts desire, and became very powerful. They became legends. This power went to their heads. They became brutal. They wanted to become rulers. Dictators, even. A new group of heroes has formed to stop their conquest, and only your performance can decide whether they succeed or not.""

	I then went to the character select screen. Must have been a new feature. To my surprised, you chose to play as either Red or Blue. They appeared to be the bad guys, but I'm sure that they'll become good guys in the end. I chose red, her always being my favorite character. She had the coolest gun, and this game was no exception. It was a minigun, bazooka, and a shotgun type weapon. I booted up the first stage. It seemed to be like GSSH, except a little bit brighter. I noticed red was wearing sun glasses. I walked left after a skydiving cutscene, and after laying a few enemies to waste, I came across a hole. Then, I was instructed to shoot a rocket down the hole to see if there was a bottom to it by Yellow. I heard multiple screams that sounded like your basic enemy shouts, and an explosion. A turret from a tank flew up out of the hole and onto a platform behind me. Yellow said it was probably safe to jump down, so I did just that.

	As I went through a falling scene similar to the falling scene from Pink's stage in both the games. I landed on some dead enemy soldier's bodies, but one was still alive. It's goggles were broken, and appeared to be crying. It looked up at Red and put its hand up, begging for help. Red stood there, looking at the soldier for about three seconds. Then a sudden zoom in on Red's face, and a very short cut scene started. 
""You are against my ways."" Red stated. ""For this, I give you no sympathy.""
The soldier looked at red for a few seconds, and burst out crying more.
""What? Scared of the inevitable end to everybody and everything? Fear no more, for you will feel no longer."" Red teased.
	The game cut back to... Well... The game and showed a small animation of Red stomping on the Soldier's head as it went motionless. There was no blood, which made it all the more disturbing. It seemed as though it was made for kids. With the anime art style and lack of blood, it was just... Incorrect. 

	I stood around for a few seconds in shock of what I saw and then it cut to another cutscene.
""OH COME ON!!!"" Shouted Red, clearly unhappy. "" Don't feel bad for this guy! He was meant to die! Nothing but a pawn in a whole plan. The heroes are not heroic. This is one big game of chess to them. Three Queens and 100 million pawns vs 1 queen. This is how war is, and always will be. Now man up and get going."" 

	This only shocked me even more. This was so... Mature... After a few seconds, I jiggled around the A and D keys to stop from triggering another cutscene before I ""Man Up"" and continue on.

	I eventually got going. I went into the second screen. There was immediately the big armadillo type guy guarded by two turrets guarded by soldiers. The armadillo guy came towards me, and I shot a rocket at it. It flew backwards. His armor was dented. He came at me again, and I hit him with a rocket again. The armadillo guy died a nice quiet death, but the two soldiers crowding the turrets crouched down and started shaking. Red walked towards them slowly and equipped the shotgun. These cutscenes are painful to watch, and I was grateful the wasn't one. Instead, we got an in game animation. Red grabbed one of the soldiers by its shirt and laughed. 	The soldier started squirming around and crying for help. The second soldier got up and the screen turned red. Not completely red, but everything was a black outline. The soldier picked up its gun and shouted something I couldn't understand in anger. He shot his gun and missed, and Red shot him. It reached up into the air for one second, and died as the redness faded as the soldier Red was holding started crying of sorrow, and, fear. Red dropped him. The soldier on all fours, Red kicked him in the ribs. The soldier fell to his knees, and then attempted to get back up. Red kicked him again. 	I was now feeling less shock than disgust, yet I was oddly attracted to it, I didn't want to look away. The soldier fell over, still breathing. Red looked at the soldier, then at the large armadillo, then at the dead soldier, then back at the one she had just kicked. Red walked away as the soldier lay on the ground, coughing and shouting, begging for help. The next screen loaded and we got to the part where you see everything in heat vision type fashion. This time, the screen was off, and I could only see the dark green screen and nothing behind it. More screams and pleas came from the soldiers, and Red broke through the green window. A Red Gunstar was standing behind the window, and was pushed to the ground when Red broke through. It was Red from the first game, along with Blue off to the side and the Scientist, to the other side of the room. The Red Gunstar laid on the ground motionless as the Blue Gunstar pulled out his gun, and the scientist crouched into a ball. Red approached the scientist. 
	
""Meh, you're boring. I'll kill you fast..."" Red teased.
	
"" Thank you..."" The scientist wheezed.

	""Naw, just kidding!"" Laughed Red as she put the heavy minigun  on the scientist's back and slid spikes under the scientists stomach so he had to hold up the gun until he couldn't hold any it any longer.

	I had never seen a spike model in the game before. Maybe this game was a platformer? The Blue Gunstar shot at Red, hitting her in her in her upper arm. She seemed completely unaffected, and slowly started walking toward the Blue Gunstar like she had concrete blocks tied to her feet. The Blue Gunstar panicked and started running around aimlessly between a wall and Red. Eventually, Red grabbed the Blue Gunstar's head and started violently smashing it against her knee. I was given a quick time event were I had to gnash the A button a lot to hit the Blue Gunstar's head on Red's knee, and press the the 8 key followed by the 4 key to throw him out a window. There was screaming, but not the usual enemy screaming. This seemed to be a sound chip inserted from a recorder instead of an 8-bit type sound. 
	
""NO, STOP, PLEASE! IT HURTS SO BAD!! GNAAA!! AAAAAAA!""
That was followed by a shorter scream shouting "" DADDY!!!""
	The Red Gunstar got up and shot Red in the bad of the head. There was still no blood, but Red was motionless. Then she started laughing. It started quiet and got loud,then her body went motionless.
	
The Red Gunstar looked disgusted. He began to take the minigun of the scientist as Blue jumped through the broken window, picked up a piece of glass, and began to walk toward The Red Gunstar. The screen went red, similar  to before, but this time I saw Red's face in the upper right corner of the screen, staring upwards at a star smirking, as if representing her legacy as a soldier and hero, and forgetting her wrongdoings. There was a twinkle in her eye, and she appeared to be a little bit teary. I started to get teary, too. My favorite character was dead, and this beautiful picture was her memorial. Such a great hero, done in by power and greed. Everything was quiet, as Blue stood silent, starting to tear up.  His eyes were closed. He opened his eyes suddenly as tears slowly drizzled from them only to stop a few seconds later, and he charged towards the Red Gunstar, screaming in anger and sadness.

	Blue took the glass he picked up and slashed the back of the Red Gunstar's neck slightly, but enough to draw blood. Yet, there was still no blood. The Red Gunstar grabbed the wound, and said, "" Help, I'm bleeding!!!"" Blue grabbed the Red Gunstar's head and smashed it on the minigun on top of the scientist's back,forcing the scientist to fall forward and get skewered, but The Red Gunstar was untouched. A similar quick time event happened with the Red Gunstar and Blue smashing  The Red Gunstar's head on his knees, but then he smashed his enemy's head on the ground, and simply shaking The Red Gunstar really hard. Eventually, The Gunstar's body went limp, and the redness went away yet again.... and the picture of Red with it, too. Blue leaned over and took off Red's sunglasses. Her eyes were frozen open. 
	
Blue dropped to his knees as little stars fell from his eyes, probably tears. The screen slowly faded black and then when the screen faded back to the scene, Blue was not at the same place. He was on top of a cliff. The screen faded white to an old memory of Blue and Red.
	
""Whoops, dropped my hat."" Said Red as she went over to Blue. 
	

""Oh, hey Blue! Can you play with me?"" It appeared that they were both lonely kids on the streets as people passed them by. I read the instruction manual for GSSH and it was Red and Blue are orphans, and Blue is like a big brother figure to Red.
	The screen faded back to Blue. 
	""Whoops..."" Said Blue. ""Dropped my gun..."" Blue dove off the cliff after it, and the screen goes red in an instant to represent the hard fall from the cliff. The final credits had only one person on it. Majin. I wanted to thank Majin and kill him at the same time. It was touching, yet disturbing. Also, I just wanted to stare at that picture of red a little longer. I called the police about this ""Majin"" person but nobody believed me. All the cameras on my computer don't work, and my video camera got broken while I was recording a video. 
	
About three weeks later I decided to check my computer for the Keylog again. Then I noticed something. I never closed out of AVG, but it wasn't up.  I entered the word ""Keylog"" again, and found the file still there. It had Gunstar Anti-Heroes and a picture. It was that picture of Red. Red wasn't lonely this time, though. Blue was there, doing the same exact thing. On the bottom right of the picture there was a message that read,""You have two webcams. I saw the reaction I wanted out of you. Here is your reward.""
	I planned on calling the police, but nobody likes a dirty rat, right?

[Minecraft]	ToastedBacon	13	13	7	"Anyone who has played the recent updates of this game would know the amount of biomes are huge, I don't like this, when I spawn in those huge winter/jungle biomes I would quit and delete the world, and start again, yesterday this kept on happening, so I had decided to downgrade to the more simpler days of the game.

Funny, now I wish I didn't, I don't know if I should get rid of the game, but what would happen if I did?

after I while I did, but something out of the ordinary happened to me on the not so new generated world in 1.6, I did the basics, punched wood, made a shack, made some tools, since the music in this game was fantastic, I would just walk out and enjoy the peacefulness of the day. This is when some ghost player started doing strange things.(I cannot confirm if herobrine or not.)

I seen a player who appears to be using the Steve skin, it looked at me, staring blankly, as if it was shocked to see me, and it said in the chatbox: ""Why did you leave me."" I noped right out of the game, re-joined, he wasn't there, then the chatbox went at it again, I'll mark numbers to represent who's speaking, 1 means me, 2 means it.

2""Why did you leave me.""

1 ""what do you mean?""

2 ""you can't leave.""

1 ""Why not?""

2 ""you left me, you can't leave me now.""

1 ""Yes I can.""

Then the game just turned off, I don't know what to do, I want to delete minecraft permanently, but I know something may happen.


I thought, this thing, is only in a computer game character, but what was weird it would respond to me, keep track or the conversation, I shrugged it off and just decided to delete the game, not expecting some average ""sp00ky computer lol."" things to happen like in the stories, I asked people about this player on minecraft forum, only one person replied, I can't say for sure if was the player I found, it was either the player referring to me as if I was stalking it, or it was some joker wanting to spook me out, the message said:

""The thing is, the pain won't go away, not unless I make it.""

Then at the bottom of the goddamn google chrome bar, minecraft was downloading, started in the game, back to the most recent version of the game, I wanted to talk to it, again, loaded a new world, I started in a jungle.

Then the chatbox said exactly the same thing as the comment on my post, it still had no name, I paused the game and looked for the post, it was deleted, the reason why I looked was to see the name of the commentor.

1. ""What do you want.""
2. ""you.""
1. ""I don't care if you're real, but you're going to die.""

He left the game, his name was the same as mine, the game closed again and a tab opened up in chrome, I was greeted by a webpage saying: ""I am you."" 
Minecraft opened up again, didn't need to login or load the world, he wanted me there instantly.

2. ""You, are me.""

I hit F5 and I was using his skin, and as soon as I did, a YouTube link opened up, there was camera footage of me, in the past 5 years, he was everywhere, he seen me behind trees, behind windows. He did all this too me, it knows me physically, I need to call the police, but one thing didn't make and that was how was he in my single player game?

UPDATE: Today I got a package, it was a picture of dead bodies and a guy holding a note saying ""Found you."" I'm going to die, I shown the picture to the police, I decided to stay somewhere secure, populated and I could be protected at my most vulnerable state, but there was no where I could go, I went on minecraft to talk to him.

1. ""Kill me if you want.""
2. ""You are me.""
1. ""Well guess what, I am you.""

UPDATE 2: Hey guys, I am ToastedBacon's best friend, he had killed himself, he told me his reddit account's password, I got a letter from the supposed stalker, it was a note saying when I get the note, it said: ""I will kill himself."" I thought, I will kill himself? It was either a grammar mistake or he actually think's he is ToastedBacon, I will not use TB's real name. His family and friends are very update, as am I, some people in this world are twisted, and I'd hate to say it, but if you're born mental, you should kill the person, because he's not living, he is not interacting with other people, and sometimes can start irritating others. I swear to God this person who stalked him has' a mental disability, he has murdered others (TB showed me the photo.) and all the emotional pain I've been having...

1362348956.0	19ll2u	The Broken Link.	SlaphappyCardinal	5	5	7	"Recently, I have been on Reddit, looking up Creepypastas and stuff like that.  Then I found creepygaming.  I started viewing more and more of them, and of course, each one got creepier and creepier...  But anyways, after I got bored on Reddit, I went to Google and searched creepygaming.  I scrolled the results until I found something worth checking out.  It was a link to a game.

I was feeling brave.  I tried downloading the game.  The link was broken.  All that was in the description was "".DND."" and then the link under that, which  I found odd, since I didn't know what DND meant.  Since the link was broken, I just exited the browser and decided to play Amnesia, since I was in the horror game mood.  But as soon as I exited the browser, my computer froze.  After sitting there for a while I decided it wasn't going to fix itself.  I tried turning it off normally.  Didn't work.  Then I did the thing that always works; Taking out the battery.  And surprisingly, that didn't work.  The screen was still frozen.  It was of my desktop, but something was off.  In the top right corner, where I put my Recycling Bin, there was a folder, titled "".DND.""
That really creeped me out, as I had never actually downloaded the file, since the link lead to nothing.  I decided to leave my computer and come back later, to see if anything would happen.  When I came back...

The screen was pure red.  Brick red.  Blood red.  I wiggled the mouse.  Nothing.  So I closed the laptop (It was a laptop) and then left it again.  It was late, so I went to bed, but couldn't help worrying that I may have gotten a virus.  The next morning I had to go to school, so I had to wait yet again.  When I finally got back from school, though, I raced up to my room to find my laptop open, at the login screen.  Both my parents go to work before I'm even up for school, so they couldn't have messed with it while I was gone, because it was perfectly fine before I left for school.  Whatever.  I logged on, noticing it was no longer frozen, and everything looked fine.  There was no more "".DND."" In place of the Recycle Bin.  All looked fine.  But me, being the curious kid I am, decided to click on the Recycle Bin and see what was in it, since the little icon was empty before it got replaced, and now it had trash in it, according to the Icon.  So I opened it.  It came up as if I was in a folder, not the Recycle Bin.  There was a folder inside the mystery folder, this time titled "".DNO.""  Strange.  I opened it, and I saw a .exe file labeled "".DNP.""  I booted it up, and it showed a cmd prompt, executing a bunch of commands.  After a minute or so of watching this endless scroll of command lines, my computer shut off.  Completely.  I turned it back on, and instantaneously a menu screen that was entirely black came up, with one option, clearly labeled in the middle of the screen in white text: PLAY.

These past few days had been creepy, but I had no option, since there was no way to exit out of the Screen (I tried everything).  I clicked PLAY, and the screen went black (Or just took away the play option).  After waiting, for what seemed like forever, something came up.  It was a first person game.  I was in a very poorly pixelated field, fenced off so I can't leave, and there were Trees everywhere.  It almost reminded me of Slender, but there was no sound whatsoever, and I knew my volume was up enough too hear if there was.  I walked foward for a bit, looking around at the crappy scenery.  Then I came across a cabin.

But not an ordinary cabin.  This cabin was very skinny and tall.  It would have looked like an ordinary cabin sprite if it was so distorted.  But still, there was a door.  So I entered it.

As soon as I walked into it, I regretted it.  It was pitch black, in every direction, and there was no exit.  I soon lost track of which way I was looking, as there was nothing on the screen to indicate where I was.  The only reason I knew that this game was still running was because of this faint, almost whisper like buzz coming from within the game.  It sounded almost like a baby.  It was so realistic, I peered around my bedroom, making sure that it was coming from my laptop.  Then, when I looked back at the laptop, there was a really tiny glow coming from in front of my character.  I could tell it was trying to look as if it was a light from far away, so I went towards it.  It got closer and bigger the more I walked in its direction.  After walking for about three minutes, the buzz started getting louder.  And louder.  And louder.  I could now easily tell it was a baby.  But it was demented.  It's cry was of a babies, but it had a deep, bellowing voice, almost so distorted and messed up I couldn't handle it.  My whole body froze as this sound got louder and louder, hurting my ears, making them ring.  It was a devilish sound that I will never forget.  It made me want to just run, run away from everything.  But my body was frozen in fear.  I could see my character walking towards the light still, me holding down the key, trying to let go of it, my body not letting me.  I got right up to the bright light, and then the noise turned into a woman screaming, so loud, scared, vivid.  You could hear the blood rising up her throat as she made out the words, ""Sleep Tight.""  Then the noise cut, and at that moment, A baby, black eyes, almost as if it had no eyes, bloody, such detail in it, brains hanging out of its head, a tooth stuck through its lip.  It was so disgusting and horrifying I almost threw up at the sight of it.  It opened its mouth, wider than any mouth should open, and out of it was two red eyes.  They continually came closer to the screen, then a face formed.  It was dark blue and its eyes now white, it covered the screen.  I was shaking in my chair, still unable to move.  It smirked, then said in the perfect voice, ""Found You.""

But it didn't come from the laptop.  It came from behind me.

At that moment I swung around in my chair, panting, only to find nothing.  When I turned back around there was my desktop, everything normal.  I scanned every inch of my computer to find something resembling that game, but nothing came up.  I was still shaking, almost crying.  It was the most vivid facial features I had ever seen.  I decided to go to bed.  That night, I had nightmares about it.  I woke up, screaming.  I looked around the room.  Everything was okay...  But I was still scared.  I couldn't help but feel that baby, that face...  Watching me in the darkness...  Where I couldn't see it, but it could see me.  I closed my eyes slowly, looking into the darkness.  Right when I close my eyes, I noticed something small and pale, crouching on the floor.  But I fell asleep right then.  I woke up, still shaken from that game.  It was saturday, so I had no school, but my parents still worked, so they were gone.  I hopped on my laptop and started browsing the internet.  Then I had a dumb idea.

I searched "".DND."" and what came up shocked me.

It was an abbreviation for ""Do Not Download.""  That startled me.  I looked up the other two ("".DNO."" "".DNP."").  But I already had an idea of what they meant.  "".DNO."" meant ""Do Not Open."" and "".DNP."" meant ""Do Not Play.""

It made sense, but how was I supposed to know?  It was just a harmless post...

But it wasn't.  I trying finding the site again to report it for any reason I could, just to get it off the Internet.  Everywhere I searched, there was nothing there.  The post was gone.

Thankfully.

To this day I still have nightmares about it, and can't fight the feeling that it's there, behind me, whispering ""Found You.""  I decided to never look up anything related to that again.  Who knows what else is out there.

1361689431.0	194gh1	New Game	xtremetoxicguy	9	9	5	"Bryce was playing another game of Minecraft. Murdering pigs, finding diamonds, all in a day's work. He had been playing since early beta, and he knew the game by heart. He explored every world, and knew his was around them all, even though they were randomly generated. But then he got bored of the game.

   So time passed, and about a month later, he logged on his account. He updated to 1.2, which is not the recent version. He discovered the new items and functions, and then decided to play his old survival map. He noticed the world had changed from the update, but his builds remained the same. He then picked up his task he abandoned of finding diamonds, and picked up a iron pickaxe  and headed down a shaft underneath his house.

   As he finally reached the cave, he discovered that no monsters were found, even though there were no torches. He checked his difficulty, which was still at normal, as usual. He quickly made the most of this opportunity, and rushed to find diamonds. Through the caverns he went. Up and down, left and right, but found nothing.

   Except for a mining shaft. But this was no ordinary shaft, as he had already seen the abandoned ones in older updates. This ones was completely built, as if someone already lived here. He plopped himself down thinking only of it as a new patch he never noticed. As his curiosity increased, so did his speed.

   The shaft was just a long tunnel, with a completed rail below his feet. There were no cobwebs, or spawners of any kind. Just stone, and wood posts. As he sprinted, he saw the end in the distance. He had sprinted till his food bar stopped him, and his patients began to run out. Then, he hit a door.

   Wondering what was inside, he slowly opened the door. It was a boxed room of wood. A bed, a chest, and a sign that read, ""if you were to find me"". He opened the chest to see a single sword. A diamond sword, with no enchantments or damage.

   He then placed it in his inventory. The hiss of a creeper was heard from the monitor. Bryce jumped at the sound, but no monster was seen. He made his was to the surface, so he could test out his new weapon. It was night, and was perfect for slicing zombies. Grassy hills, and trees around, but only one zombie was seen. 

  He jumped to sliced the creature to death, and as he did, the game froze. It stayed this way until a crash screen was shown. Something on that screen startled him into attempting to turn off the computer. The console read: ""You have taken something from me. Now I will take something from you."" Then the computer restarted.

   His heart pumped as the computer booted up. It automatically set to the safe mode, even though there was no option to do so. He was about to restart it again, until he looked at the screen. In blood red, it said, ""You do not take things from me...""

   But before he could even begin to be startled at that quote, Minecraft started up again, only this time, only the title was shown in small font in front of a black background. He clicked Single Player, then was met with a save marking his name. He swore to himself he named it ""My World"", as he usually does. As his common sense returns, he then resets the computer back to its regular settings. Everything is normal as he searches the web about what he witnessed, to see if it was in the update somehow. No reply.

   He checks the folders to see if he put in a mod of that description. It was pure. He checked the game again without regret to see if everything went back to normal. He went with the save, and he was placed back into the room where he found the sword. No doors.

   He tried breaking the wood, but it didn't lay a crack. Then the soundtrack file, ""Danny"", is played...backwards. Soon after, a player has joined the game. He knew for sure he was in single player, and the screen read ""        has joined"". By his fear, he tried to exit the game, with no luck. He goes to task manager, only to find he his still in the game.

   The screen then shots to his character falling into a bottomless pit as the sound of multiple ghasts screaming, then cut to the crash screen again. Unable to exit the tab, he quickly unplugs the machine. 

   Days later, he never went back to his game. He went to a shop to see if there were any viruses, even though when he checked, there were none spotted. He waited until he was brave enough to play it again. This were to be his last.

   Already when the launcher showed up, the updated all read ""run"" hundreds of times. He ignored it and moved on to go to his world. His save was changed to ""youshouldnthavecomeback"" in bold red. Nervously clicking, he was then placed back into the room, but surrounded by fire. The player was completely gone in third person, and soon fire engulfed the wood. 

   Then, when the fire had soon gone out, a massive dome out of soul stone was around him. Screams of ghasts had been heard once more, and in the text box, wrote ""if you were to find me"" without a username. ""Danny"" was played backwards again, and hissing of creepers flooded the computer to freeze again. Instead of going to another crash screen, he was back at the long hallway, peering into the dark. His back was against a wall, and he saw a figure walking towards him.

   He pressed control, alt, and delete, but failed. ""it is your turn"" said in the text box. He then tried unplugging the machine, and to his shock, the screen was still on. The figure moved closer and closer, his body shaking with fear. Ghasts and creepers were heard at full blast, and he could finally see the character. 

   It looked so familiar, and the realization hit him like a ton of bricks. It was HIS character speeding at him with an iron axe. The backwards song got louder and louder, and he could read the words on the user reading ""goodbyebryce"". It was only seconds away to him, and he left his computer to run out of his room. The door was locked.

   He saw as the blocky figure moved, only feet away, swinging the axe. Bryce was terrified, not knowing what to do.

Then the computer shut off. 

   Bryce was found dead by the foot of his bed that same day. No marks, no evidence, all but a computer staring face to face at his dead corpse. When the police stepped in to investigate, they searched his computer to find that there was no Minecraft to be seen. The computer was normal.

   He was accused of suicide, and the case was closed. No one was to think a video game such as Minecraft were to be a suspect for a murder. Some people claim that his soul was to be left in the game. It is to be left a rumor, as just to scare the others who have found the same sword in the game.

1360547668.0	18a5cu	GLaD YoU aRe HerE (Creepypasta)	SlimyRage	9	7	1	"I played Portal a-lot when it came out and quickly became a fan. I played up until the GLaDOS fight than I accidentally broke it. I sent it back for a refund but they were out of stock. So I went ahead and got it on steam during a sale. During the download a random text file came on my desktop reading *You could not kill her. I did.* I had no idea what it meant or how it got there. So I deleted it and began to play.


I noticed something was wrong at the very beginning. The title screen background was just pure black with the options. I thought it was just my old graphic card or a glitch so I started a new game. When the game started up normally except GLaDOS was nowhere to be heard and the starting room was a mess with a bunch of electric parts and wires. Probably the most unsettling thing was that a dark figure was looking out the windows of every chamber some had blood and others had him holding something I could not make out.


The game played quite normally besides that until I dove into a Rattman area. The walls were instead soaked in blood with some of the writing reading *It killed her, and now it will want you.* or *She knows.* Than a voice that was feminine not GLaDOSes asked *Do you know what I am doing for you?* I used the console to respond with *No.* She responded *I have killed her for you. Isnt that what you wanted?* I asked if she was talking about GLaDOS in which she responded with *Yes. Are you glad Im here?* than she no longer replied.


I made it to the final room where GLaDOS was intended to be but instead the dark figure stood in her place. The figure looked like a woman with black hair, clothes and eyes with pale skin. The object she was holding looked like the head of GLaDOS smeared with blood. She said *Look I did kill her. Are you happy? Can you let me free now?* I asked her what she meant and she became furious. *You mean he was right?!* I once again asked what she meant and she answered *I need  to kill you to leave.* As she draws out a knife from behind her. She kills me and says *Im sorry but I dont want to be here. Its worse than hell.* Rather than respawning the game crashes leaving me a crash report with the words like *Why am I still here?*, *Is this really hell?*, *Kill me, or kill me again*, and *Help Me Please*. Written over and over.

I deleted all the files and re downloaded the game after ward and everything went back to normal. Although when I defeat GLaDOS she says *She brought me to hell you know. Than you brought her to it.*

I thought nothing of it and played my own music, another 10 minutes goes by, and i walk to another mission, i pause my music to listen to the cutscene, but it was pointless, the sound was gone from that mission as well, i played the previous mission and the cutscene had audio. Ok now im getting creeped out. I continue playing with  my music and now with subtitles on, only to notice a couple minutes later, all sound had cut out. The only sound i could hear now, was the car horn. I was a bit creeped out and just wondering weather this is a corrupted audio file or something, when a horrible screeching sound, much like the sound from that halo video posted on this subreddit recently. It goes for at least 10 seconds, i had backed away from my desk, before the sound abruptly stopped. All my audio is back. WHAT. THE. FUCK.

There's a waterfall and a large lake below the earthen walkways, and, when I found a path that lead down to the lake, I decided to check it out. I walked down and entered the lake to search for any nice loot that could have been hidden at the bottom. I eventually ran out of air on my first dive and had to return to the surface. On my way up, I noticed something that appeared to be floating on the surface of the lake, but I didn't have time to check it out because I knew that I would begin to take damage very soon. I surfaced and got some fresh air (I took no drowning damage) and swam over to where the floating object had been. When I got the location, I instantly took a small amount of damage and my character made one of the damage taking grunt sounds while being pulled underwater by some unknown force. I quickly looked around for an enemy that could have attacked me, and I saw something, I have no idea what it was, rapidly spinning off into the distance. I immediately got out of the lake and sprinted through the rest of the quest. I saved my game just after I forged the Aetherium Crown, and I turned off my Xbox.

I believe one of the bodies you find is a guy impaled on the tusk of a mammoth skeleton. Another body you find inside a sarcophagus. I also think there is a detective, maybe Irish, definitely with red hair and maybe a red beard as well. I remember that at the end of the game it asks you a bunch of questions based on the clues you find and then asks you who the murderer is. At the end, it shows your character in bed and someone pops up at the window of your bedroom and shoots you to death while you're sleeping.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOxabfdwwhI

This is what I'm talking about, I know the Statues are supposed to follow you in Fort Frolic but they're following me EVERYWHERE. I went to the level after Fort Frolic (Hephaestus?) and there was one standing right outside the bathysphere, in it's ""statue"" form. I've played through this game like 30 times and this has never happened.

I killed the thing and went on until I saw three in the level and decided to ""retreat"" and went to the Medical Pavilion. I saw one next to the first ADAM machine, this time, it got *into* it's statue form. I almost pissed myself and ran out. I then went to Steinman's Operating Room, where you first attack him. I saw an audio log and never have seen it before, but I guess I just missed it, but it was Sander Cohen's log! In it he said something about the statue splicers he helped make with Steinman and how they were killing his loyal splicers. I went to the Wiki and found nothing of this audio log.

I called my friend and told him to come over, when he arrived, I explained the situation to him and he was creep out, then we started playing through the levels and shit, taking turns of course.

It started getting really disturbing, the splicer were painting on the wall with their blood, stuff I have never seen happen and never wanted to see honestly. My friend took some picture on his phone but were always corrupted, we tried Photobucket, Imgur and even Facebook but none worked. Then I was taken to the dashboard on my 360 and the save file had been deleted.

I know this sounds made up and stupid but I swear on all that is holy that this took place and I have a witness, I've been sort of paranoid for a day or so too. I don't want to even touch my Xbox."	t5_2tv55	True

The game downloaded smoothly and it started up fine. Chose to enable Steamworks not working about bugs. Then I hit the menu, there was no sound at all and it looked like the title was glitched with blood textures replacing the title ones. I passed off as a bug with Steamworks and started up the game to find that there was no music playing at all. The sounds were extremely loud and I could only change the music volume (which was broken anyway). So after what I think was the tutorial level (im not sure if I should be talking to a guy in a wolf mask) I am sent to the first level with the mask options. I chose the first one even though every mask was unlocked already for some reason. I finish the level and am sent to a small room with a enemy in the middle already coated in blood. A dialogue box comes up with the bloody face of the enemy. The text read ""YOU DO NOT BELONG HERE. GO AWAY NOW."" I suddenly equipped a shotgun and decided to shoot him. Upon impact the game crashed leaving a error report on my desktop. Upon reading the report it looked like the game had a memory shortage. At the end of the report the words ""LEAVE"" were written over and over.

I dont know if I should open up the game again or just delete it."	t5_2tv55	True

While I was digging down on Minecraft, I reached the bed rock, so I make a ""check point room"" with all materials and stuff to survive down there while mining. After sometime mining, I decided to go back and restock on pickaxes and food. I've been mining on one direction without going through rooms or what not, so I don't get lost. After a while going back I face a dead end; I swear I could't get lost because of how I mined. But the creepy thing begins now: I started to mine through that dead end but didn't find anything. So I decided to head back and retrace my steps. I had only 2 breads left so I eat them so I could sprint without concerns. While sprinting, my character suddenly stops and for less than half a second the screen turned gray with black bars and my character lost half his health. I got super creep out so I decided to walk cautiously with my diamond sword. Then it happened again, I naturally died, but this time it took my full health. When I respawned in my castle, I saw zombies, creepers, skeletons, spiders and endermans breaking in! They were hundred, something that never happened before.

I never really liked the game but I couldn't remember why. I had a very old copy of the game and above further inspection i noticed something... my copy said beta in the corner and had a slightly different cover. another strange thing was that on the back of the cartridge a piece of paper was taped with a cheat code titled: secret character unlock. I decided that it would be an overpowered and awesome character and maybe that's why it was a secret. when I finished entering the code which I wont tell you for your own good when i went to the character select screen I saw the new character. The characters name was jealous Luigi. He was simply just luigi in marios clothes and I thought it was pretty funny. I played a time trial on rainbow road and that's when i noticed something very odd. something was tied to the back of the car. and then i saw it... it was mario. his eyes were as dark as black holes. I remembered why I didnt like this game as a kid. I instantly quit back to character select screen and noticed mario was gone and he was replaced with luigis model. I quit to the title and saw the game was named luigi kart and mario was laying there with luigi standing above him with a laugh that wouldnt stop playing. I went back to title screen and saw he was the only character left so i quit back to title again to have the same thing but everyone else was dead to.I quit the game and threw it out and never played a mario game again	t5_2tv55	True

1349293016.0	10w41q	Jack Hill - The Mystery Of Game And Watch	YES_Im_Taco	4	6	4	"Hello, my name is Sam.
I live in a high-rise studio apartment in Philadelphia.
Recently, I’ve seen many arcane events unfold, and I would greatly appreciate any advice.
Let me start at the beginning. Just a few days ago, after arriving home from my part-time job (I also go to Drexel University part-time), I decided to take a short nap on my couch. Around an hour later, I was abruptly awoken when I heard the sound of a disk being read near my television. I then rubbed my eyes and noticed that the Wii had been turned on. I didn’t think much of it; unusual things often occurred in my apartment – doors would open and close, lights would flicker on and off, etcetera.
Curious, I turned on the television, and was delighted to see the Super Smash Bros. Brawl logo flash on the screen. Months have passed since I last played that game, and I was eager to reclaim my self-proclaimed title as the “Brawl Master”. I quickly set up a match between myself, R.O.B, and a level-nine computer player with a random character at a random stage.
After the load screen vanished, Flat Zone 2, the stage representing an archaic Game and Watch console, was revealed along with my enemy – Lucas from Mother 3. Before I delivered my first attack, however, I noticed that the name over the character did not say “CPU” as it usually does. Instead was the name “Jack H.” “That’s odd,” I thought. While I was pondering how the name got there, Lucas jumped to the ledge of the skyscraper that was near the corner of the stage. Suddenly, all in-game music stopped. I reached for the remote, wondering if I accidentally muted the game. While I tried, in vain, to make the volume return, streaks of static rippled throughout the screen.
“What’s wrong with this stupid thing?” I shouted. Then, a second later, I saw Lucas fall from the ledge of the skyscraper. But just before his body reached the ground, the entire screen was inundated with static, accompanied by a loud screeching sound. I hastily fumbled for the remote and shut off the television. Sighing in relief, I headed toward the kitchen. I was dying for something to drink. I made it only half way to my destination before I was paralyzed by the baleful sight; on the counter lay a dusty Game and Watch. I slowly crept forward to find a note attached. It read, “You should play this game! It’s really, really fun!” At the bottom of the note was a sloppy signature, “Jack H.”
Confused and panicked, I darted out of my apartment and stood with my back against my door. I took several deep breaths to regain my composure. Somehow, I convinced myself to go back inside; it was getting late, after all. I swiftly opened my door, and saw another note on the floor. Trembling, I picked it up and read aloud: “Come play with me! Jump down, I’ll catch you!” Once again, the note had the uncanny signature of “Jack H.”
The lights abruptly shut off, and the door leading to the balcony slammed open. A powerful gust of wind pushed me forward. “What do you want from me?” I demanded. All I heard in return was the lurid sound of a boy’s laughter. The wind became so strong that I tripped; I was propelled to the threshold of the room leading to the balcony. With all the strength I could muster, I latched onto the door and screamed.
Suddenly, the front door burst open and a voice loudly asked: “Sam? What’s going on in here?” Simultaneously, the lights flashed back on and the wind dissipated, leaving my house in sheer bedlam. “Chris…” I murmured, catching my breath. “I was just about to have a smoke, and I heard you yelling… This place is trashed! What happened?” “Chris,” I asked, “Do you have any idea who ‘Jack H’ could be?” His eyes widened, and he asked, “Wh- where did you hear that name?” “He’s been leaving extremely disturbing notes everywhere. Why, do you know him?” I asked. His face cringing in fear, he retorted, “This is really bad. Hurry and come with me, I’ll tell you about Jack Hill.”
We rushed into his place, adjacent to mine, and began talking. “Jack Hill was the only child of Mary Hill, who lived where you do now,” Chris quickly said, while gathering many of his belongings. “As you know, I’ve lived here for a very long time. Jack and Mary lived here several decades ago. Being a single mom, Mary worked two jobs to support herself and her child. She did whatever she could for the boy, but was rarely home to see him. She longed for her son to be happy, and one day she bought him some videogame called ‘Fire’ for the-” “Game and Watch?” I interrupted.
“…Yes,” he continued. “Jack really liked that game. In fact, whenever his mother saw him, he was playing that game. He became so addicted to the game, that he skipped school one day to play it. After receiving notification from the school, his mother had no choice but to take the game away from him. Afraid that he would find the game, she explained the situation to me and asked me to keep it. Jack became hysterical; through the walls I heard him talking nonstop about the game, high scores, and how he ‘saved the day every time’. Though I found his rambling disconcerting, I saw it as harmless… That is, until that cold, windy night.”
“That night, when Jack’s mother arrived home, he begged her to ‘play with him’. ‘Sure. What would you like to play?’ she asked. Then, I heard a door barge open, followed by a strange request: ‘Jump down, I’ll catch you!’ The last thing I heard was a terrified shriek next door. I ran there as fast as I could, but when I opened the door, all I saw was the deranged face of Jack Hill, standing next to the ledge of the balcony. ‘What have you done?’ I asked. He flourished a big smile, one that felt like a thousand needles piercing my skin, and jumped off of the building.”
After Chris told the story, he had finished stuffing his belongings in a suitcase. “Listen to me, Sam; both of the people who lived there before you also leapt to their death. I refuse to see another life disappear before me. The police may think these suicides are coincidences, but I know that Jack Hill had something to do with it. His rancor will never be put to rest, Sam. You need to move immediately, before it’s too late. I’m leaving now; best of luck to you.”
“You’re leaving already?” I asked, watching him press the button to summon the elevator. He gave me a nervous smile, waved farewell, and descended to the first floor. As quickly as possible, I ran into my room, grabbed my wallet, and left that wretched apartment.
Two days after these events, I am now typing this in a hotel a few blocks away.
My student loans can’t pay for my stay here much longer, and I certainly can’t afford to break my lease… I’m terrified to return to my apartment, but I can’t think of anything else I can do."	t5_2tv55	True

But before I could press continue, It cut back to the game again.

Leon. Just standing there, not doing anything irregular.

I resumed playing but noticed that ashley's life bar was still there,
And every 5 minutes or so she would take tiny amounts of damage,
This continued until I was much farther ahead in the game.
Until finally, her last bit of health went away.
I heard A deafening scream through my headphones.
LEON!
Like any normal person, I freaked the hell out.
So I decided I would go ""look"" for ashley.
In the back of my mind I knew it wouldnt solve anything, but right about then I wanted some god damned answers.
I backtracked a few doors.
I came upon A breakable wooden door.
But something wasnt right..
It Was COVERED in blood.
My first thought was: I didnt do this..
My second thought was: What did this?
I kicked the door, hoping to find 'Answers'
But that's not what I got, through THAT door.
I kicked the door in, jogged a few feet....
I was standing in a circular room, littered with skulls and various bones.
There was what I thought was a female ganado kneeling over a body in the corner.

She got up, turned around...
It was ashley, Dressed as a villager, with a bloodied and beaten face.
Her mouth was just Uh... If You took a cheese grader to someones lips, that's what It would look like.

She stared at me for a couple seconds..
Her life bar flashed back to full and I immediately opened fire on her with my Red9 Handgun.
As her life dropped, she fell to the ground, and died.
I got the game over screen, with leon falling to his knees and saying.. Oh no.. But on the game over screen, ashleys mangled face was getting closer and closer to the ""Camera"" I immediately quit the game,

1368900329.0	1el516	Cry of Fear is so artistically vacant it borders on outright plagiarism.	Weeperblast	3	6	6	"Hello, spooks.

I heard about this goldensource mod, Cry of Fear, and I'm sure most of you are familiar with it. I started playing it, without any real expectations other than the knowledge that Rich 'Lowtax' Kyanka, of somethingawful.com fame, did a LP on it, showcasing how terribly awful it is. That being said, somethingawful.com lampoons everything under the sun, so it could something worth playing.

Oh, how wrong I was.

I'm a big Silent Hill buff. All the endings, speed runs, story analysis, everything. The sheer amount of ideas that CoF took from Silent Hill is just appalling. It's like you're playing a Bizarro Silent Hill game made by FPS knuckleheads. It's the bottom-of-the-barrel, lowest-common-denominator garbage that relies on jump-scares and twitchy-bloody-guy with a knife shambling towards you.

I'm not going to suggest that Silent Hill is an entirely unique product; the streets of the town are named after inspirational authors. They've crafted their own product by taking measured bits from other sources, and mixed it all with a great deal of novelty and horror-pioneering. 

Here are some elements that I think were borrowed outright from the SH series. I might me wrong on some of these, and I'd be interested to hear your opinions:

* The player is a lone dude in a foggy, snowy ghost town trapped in perpetual night
 
* The levels tend to have a normal side, and a bloody, twisted 'other side'
 
* Some portions of the game involve walking over metal grates where creeps from below try to reach up and grab you
 
* The save point is 'somewhere I can record my thoughts for later'
 
* The soundtrack takes liberally from Yamaoka's styles, and even borrows sound effects directly from SH2 and 3. 
 
* One level is an apartment building where iron bars show up in the middle of the hallway, with items on the other side that you cant reach until you find a way around. 
 
* The apartment building has rooms interconnected by a broken-down wall.
 
* The player goes through a sewer level, to arrive at a construction site. 
 
* The player goes through a bullshit maze of dead-end hallways.
 
* The player has to run a similar maze when a boss monster chases after them.
 
* The intro has a splash screen explaining that the game contains blood and gore, and even goes so far as to say that the game has been known to cause 'heart failure and suicide'
 
* Hospital gurneys showing up in random places.

And this is just a starter list. The enemies include blatant rip-offs of Leatherface, Freddy Krueger and a less-blatant rip-off of Pinhead. Outside of Silent Hill, the game also shamelessly rips off the Penumbra Series throughout the underground portion, and elsewhere.

I honestly don't understand how people can get excited about this game. It is just so obnoxiously derivative.

When I arrived There were mor dead villagers and more kommodos. This happened several times before I looked through my camera and was greeted by about ten lights all of them white and flashing in different patterns. Then all of a sudden A random waypoint spawned in. I decided to follow it since it was going in the direction of the lights. It led me to a bridge which dissapointed me until I went under the bridge to find a crashed car at the bottom of a river. When I got closer I found reverse hanging corpses all facing my direction [not sure if coincidence] and part of the bridge. I stayed there for a while trying to find something new but nothing happened. Then an animal was marked, like when you put your camera on an enemy but it was across the island.

It was Wednesday January 30, 2013. My brother was playing 360 minecraft with his friends. They played for a couple 
hours and then they got off. He then started his own world that he had been working on for a while. Not very long into 
playing the world a player appeared named ""dannyj98"". He had an interesting skin. It had long black hair white shirt 
and black pants with a white face.The skin was included in skin pack 3. He was slain  multiple times by my brother with an 
enchanted diamond sword. About, 10 minutes later of continously killing him, he was kicked.But he kept joining the
game. He then joined my brother's party. He had an Indian accent. He acted quite hostile towards my brother and was
now at this point greefing and looting the world. Then he left the game and the party by saying I'm deleting you. He was
not my friend nor my brother. His friends didn't even know who he was. My brother got off and walked away extremely 
confused about what just happened. We ate dinner and 2 hours later went to bed. At about 3:30 a.m I was awakened by
a loud bloody cry from the room next to mine which happened to be my brothers. I grabbed a sharp object I saw in my 
room just in case. As I walked into the room there was nobody there just my brother in his bed. I walked closer just to
see if he was okay. As I approached him I rested my hand on his bed and it was wet. I went and turned the light on and 
I was spechless at what I saw on my hand. It was blood. My hand was covered in blood. I quickly went back to the bed
and it looked like a sharp object, probably a knife went through his head and killed him. I felt sick inside. I was about
to throw up, but on my way out something in the hall attacked me and I fell to the floor. It looked like a human form of
the skin I saw in the game. I fiercely fought with this thing. It would get on top of me and try to grab my face, but I 
wouldn't let him. I would punch dannyj in the face, and then with its hair in my grasp I smashed its head into the wall, but it 
did absolutely nothing to him. My mother came into the hallway with her 9 mm pistol, and got a clear shot. She took it
and got the thing twice in the head. It killed him to my relief and heavily breathing, and with some cuts and bruises, I 
got up and threw up in the bathroom. My mom quickly came to check on me. I told her that my brother was dead and she
started to cry. I sat down feeling depressed. I walked back out into the hallway and dannyj98 was gone. "	t5_2tv55	True

Crashing cars, shooting people, stealing stuff, etc. I was extremely bored. I drove up to the side walk and neatly parked my car. I sat there in boredom, figuring out what pointless thing to do next. It began to rain a bit. My emotionless character stood their breathing. Then, a man walked by me on the sidewalk. I observed the man; what he was wearing; where was walking. He had a black jacket on, black shoes, and an umbrella. I then thought about the video game simulation theory scientists were investigating. Earth and all of humanity could be a simulated game, and we could be controlled by other people. This idea baffled me. What if the man who walked by me was in fact a real person? What if he was just walking home, minding his own business? Or is he just a fictional, generic character made by GTA? I follow him. I noticed the way he walked was a bit different than every body else. I slowly followed him for a few blocks. He was breathing, walking with character. He pulled a cigarette and began smoking it. The smoke flew by my characters face.
The man walked into an internet cafe. I watched through the window. What if this was actually a man living in a different universe? All though this game might be fake to us, could it be real to them? Am I crazy? Is this guy alive and breathing, just taking a walk through his home town?
He left the cafe and I followed him some more. After a few blocks, he sat down onto bench. The newspaper he was holding, he took out and started reading it.
After he finished, he stood up again and began walking. He was walking into a neighbor hood. He stopped walking in front of a house, and just stopped. I stood in front of him. The questions came bac to my head. Is this man alive in a different universe? Is this even possible? I stood their with him. I doubted myself. What was I thinking? What was I doing? Follow him, as if any of my theories could be possible? What an idiot I am, I thought to myself. I pulled out my knife, and stabbed him to death.
He layed there, bleeding. Was this a good idea? Does it even matter? ""It's just a video game"" I thought to myself. An ambulance arrived, and then all of a sudden - My TV turned off. Along with the rest of the power in my house. I layed on my couch, confused. Was the man I met in this game alive? Did I just brutally kill someone, for no reason? My heart started beating fast. Why did the power go out, right when this happened? Could this be a coincidence?
It was exactly 2:13 pm. I got up, went to my bed, and fell asleep. 4 hours later at 6:20 I woke back up. Tired, I noticed my power was back. When I went in to play GTA, it did not work. The game kept on reading ""please open and close tray"". The game was broken. I was broken. Did I kill an innocent man?"	t5_2tv55	True

1363003999.0	1a2tac	I don't want to receive honor anymore. (x-post r/leagueoflegends)	Fenryll	28	33	18	"Before reading this, I just want to clarify that this post is not an attack on the honor system of League of Legends; it is more of a personal statement...

My client crashed midway through a game two days ago, and I was feeling pretty tired, so I logged off and went to sleep. After relogging today, I noticed that I had received an honor from that game, the ""honorable opponent"" one, to be exact. I originally thought someone DDOS'd it, but the fact that I received honor from it was weird to me. I couldn't really remember what that game was about, since it was so short, but luckily, I had the recording of it on my LolReplay, despite it not showing up on my match history.

I played Nocturne jungle for that game, like I usually do, more recently now because of the new skin, and I had a pretty standard build for about 15 minutes, which was a madred's razor, some boots, a vamp scepter and a few health pots up until the point that my client crashed.

Upon re-watching it, I realized off the bat that something was...off about that game. The enemy jungler never connected. In the loading screen, his/her name never appeared. ""Typical"" I thought. ""The name is probably in another language."" But after the screen loaded, I saw that he simply had no name. Stranger yet, he was also a Nocturne player. From the beginning, he sat still in his base.

I might as well describe to you what happened during the game. We started out normally, and I jungled and ganked, but no one died for the first 15 minutes of so. Everyone was reasonably leveled and farmed, with every player being in the 6-10 level range, save for the enemy Nocturne. It was at 15:13 when I used my ultimate to get what seemed to be an assured kill on the enemy Soraka. This is when the game crashed...or when I thought it crashed. My recorder thought otherwise.

In the replay, the screen glitched for about 10 seconds after I ulted her, with everything freezing in place. When I was actually playing the game, it was during this glitch that my client froze and closed on me. But in the replay, after the glitch, it showed us all still playing...this REALLY freaked me out, but I kept watching. Apparently, my ""character"" secured the kill on the Soraka, recalled and continued to jungle. That's when I read the eerie message... ""...has reconnected."" The no name jungler on the other team got back into the game somehow and started to jungle. I felt uneasy watching him.

The other lanes kept at each other, and it didn't take me long to figure out the next oddity. The Soraka ""I"" had killed never respawned. When I pressed tab to see the death timer, there was none...she just stayed dead. ""An ally has been slain."" This time someone on my team died, the Ezreal, and it was the enemy Nocturne who killed him. He never respawned either. I froze in my chair, watching people die, one by one, each death leaving a lasting impression on me.

The Nocturne that I was ""supposedly"" playing did everything I would have done, which weirded me out even further. It was almost like I was still playing in that match. After each player died, none would respawn. I was always on edge whenever I saw my character getting low on health, to the point that I was gripping my desk. I can't really explain why, but it's a nerve-racking feeling knowing that if your character died, they wouldn't come back... I kept telling myself it was a glitch, but after what happened next, I found it hard to.

There were only 3 people left. Me, the no name Nocturne, and the enemy mid laner, a Diana. At this point, my eyes were glued to the screen, and I couldn't help but watch as my character pursued her. This was the death that disturbed me the most. My character ulted towards her, as I normally would have done, and met her at her wraith camp. Just as my character got there, I saw the enemy Nocturne standing still in the passage to their red buff...he just stood there and watched my Nocturne destroy the enemy Diana.

After her death, everything was still.

The minions didn't move, the projectiles were frozen in place, along with my character. Everything was frozen except the no name jungler. He moved towards me and paused for a second. The timer in the recording was still going. Curious as to why he just stood there, I checked my settings on the recording. The chat box was unchecked. I remember my fingers shaking a bit as I clicked to check it.

The no name jungler had been typing throughout the entire match after the apparent crash. All he said, over and over, every single minute was, ""KILL THEM ALL. KILL THEM ALL."" Up until I had killed Diana. I felt my heart sink when I read those words, decorated across my screen. What he said soon after was what sent chills throughout my entire body.

""Thank you for your assistance.""

And that's when the game ended. No nexus was destroyed, no surrender vote was cast. It just ended. Horrified at what I just witnessed, I immediately took down the names of everyone in that game. After a bit of searching, I found that none of them played another game after that one. I'm still checking every few minutes, hoping that one of them will get in a game soon. I don't really know what happened to those people, and I don't think I want to know...

I have since deleted the recording from my computer. I don't want anything to do with that replay...

The image of seeing the ""honorable opponent"" message on my screen from logging in is still burned in my head...never have I felt so undeserving.

Now when San andreas was the hit games when it was released, I always try to find myth like bigfoot and yeti. Anyway, so when i load up, i go out of my house, goes to the forest where the ghost car locate at night. When i arrives there, I saw this unsual girl. She using white dress and floating. When I take out my xray goggle, she is not in red. Then it hit me. ""shit"" i said to myself. I know what I just met. It the Princess. But my inner myth hunting keep telling me to go run to the highway instead of turning off the game. So i run there. When i arrives there, MORE wierd thing happening. Peoples get out of their cars and dieing. So i decide to jump in a car and rush to Los Santos Grove Street. On the way there, i saw cars blowing up by itself, Peoples on fire, and some running DIRECTLY toward my car. Yes i should turn off my game but i was near Grove Street so I continue playing. RIGHT when I enter my house, I heard a screeching sound like on the Halo video. I take out my headphone and throw it on the table. I quickly try to exit but i cannot press it. It just has no function. Only working is the resumes. So im about the turn off the computer when there a subtitles EVEN WHEN IM ON THE PAUSE SCREEN. It read ""Is she gone?"" follow with a creepy male voice whispering the following line: ""She following you"" I has enough. I turn of the computer. 

Reddit please help me. What should I do? Now everytime i try to open GTA SA, it just loading but dont actually launch so i cant take any pictures. Should i uninstall it and install it again?"	t5_2tv55	True

1353381898.0	13hmsy	Hitman Contracts: Ghost Mirror Truth	TyBknockout	1	8	0	"In the first Hitman game (Contracts) there Is a door in one of the hotel levels that has a piece of paper tha says Closed on it. Many of you know where this is going but I'll explain it to the people who don't and than ill get to the story. If you pick the lock there should be a police officer that says ""Nothing to see here, just a nasty accident"" Kill him immediately. For this to work you must kill him because if you don't he will find you and stop you from doing this terrifying Glitch/Haunt. If you sedate him he will somehow just immediately get up and will screw you up. So anyways after you kill him run over to a room covered in blood and police lines. When you walk in bloodstains are everywhere. Head into the bathroom and look in the mirror. Soon a ghost will float out of the bathtub. (I shit you not a FUCKING GHOST) it will only be in the mirror. Break the mirror after it floats out. If you do this right then you should hear a blood curdling scream. If you don't you screwed up. If you didn't do it right a face will show up on you're screen when you least expect it. The devs put this in to fuck with you. They did it because one of the developers had one of their family members died (uncle I think) and added it in as an Easter egg. He only planned that and not what happens next. The bathtub should pen filled with blood. Shoot it 3 times exactly and a staircase will open in the room you start off in. It will be hard to find but it is there. Follow it up and there should be children laughing and blood dripping from the ceiling. If you follow it up on the walls written in blood it says ""LET ME GO...WHY DO YOU TORTURE ME."" If you look at it too long your game will crash and all your save names will have to be called ""Why"" and there Is no way to stop it. Keep on walking and there should be a door. Inside is a chamber and a man. You can shoot him or free him. Iether one is scary. If you free him your game crashes and all your save files say thank you and it will never work again on that console. If you kill him a door will open and leave to a hellish place. Chilling screams are heard thoughout. Mangled bodies are all hung on harpoons. Just keep walking. If you look on your map it is different. No people are on it and the top of your map says 666. Don't move or the game will freeze and will break your console. After exactly 20 seconds continue on and be sure to die in the next room. The man you killed will be there and he will shoot at you LET HIM KILL YOU. I can't tell you why though... The game won't let me... Nobody knows what happened to the game to make it happen. One theory is that when he added that Easter egg he pissed off his uncle and took it out on his game buyers. Oh no there he is.. please help me... Don't do this glitch please don't go through the torment I'm going through. He is everywhere I look every time I close my eyes its him.....

I found it weird and kinda creepy that he'd just kill himself because that's the first time since I've played the game back in the 90s that I've seen any Mario enemy in Super Mario 64 kill itself. 	t5_2tv55	True
