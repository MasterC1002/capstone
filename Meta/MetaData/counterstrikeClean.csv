I love 1.6 I have fond memories of playing it with my cousin and learning how to bhop, all the mods, those few seasons of ESEA but our competitive scene is not growing.... it may even be shrinking. 

There is already a huge divide between source players and 1.6 players causing neither side to have the audience it deserves. 

All other forms of competitive games have grown Starcraft BW switched to Starcraft 2 and it will surely change again with heart of the swarm. TF2 and LoL have both evolved and changed with all the updates and add ons. Dota has switched to Dota 2.

With a new game coming out it is a great time for many people to switch. Will it reach the glory of 1.6 not immediately but with all of our help we can reach that point. We can bring a once great community back together and an AMAZING game to the forefront of competitive play.

This is a great time to ESEA is branching to Europe MLG just added a gamebattles part for it which may lead to it coming into atual MLG tournaments and hey if MLG picks us up then the Intel Extreme Masters may bring it in and a form of CS will be in it again.

I am not saying uninstall 1.6 and leave to die.
Just give GO a chance, get into it and try it out, yeah it is different but we still got a month till release when the game hits the big time."	t5_2r5c3	True

1365572486.0	1c1os7	[GO] Office Video Games - Playable Video Games in Office!	mukunda_	56	3	9	"Presenting: the Sourcemod Entertainment System

After months of playing with CS:GO modding, I stumbled upon this strange idea: playable video games!

The system originally was just going to be direct input to the TV in cs_office, but I got a bit carried away! The system now features a video game console, game cartridges, controllers, and wires to connect them!!

To play you press E on a cartridge to pick it up, press E again on the console to insert it and turn it on and then you press E to pick up a controller to play!

There were no compromises here, the console has an animated power switch, cartridges sit exactly inside the console slot, the controllers have fully animated buttons, the controllers are plugged into the console and connected with a wire... yes!! it is amazing!!

There is only one game right now, which took a while to make, its called Super Mareo, its a bit different from real Mario but it uses ripped NES SMB sprites :)
The game only has one level, but I spent quite a bit of time polishing it and tweaking it so it is possible to speed-run it while killing all goombas and getting all of the coins. It also has a 2 player mode which allows two characters to play at the same time! (and yes the console supports two players of course!)

I'm really happy this was possible (the way it works is crazy!!), and its a lot of fun playing it (until the CTs come)! I've made a quick video and some screenshots, but if you want to see it in person you can connect to our CS:GO server at 74.201.57.168 :)

http://youtu.be/zQU55ukMqLk
http://imgur.com/a/LBB8K

It is an exclusive mod for our server right now, as we're aiming to push our server rank as high as possible, maybe later it can be shared with other servers (it should work on any source game!)

Anyway, for reddit's amusement -- the SMES :D

Many thanks to these people to make this possible:
Knuckles for the original SNES model and textures
S.S.H for the music (http://youtu.be/Xj90Vcq2Kic , http://youtu.be/mKyuJoBSEug )
Sound effects from Jake Kaufman/Virt's ridiculous Mario video with NEXTGEN AAA sound effects (http://youtu.be/u9wp6cz0A1o) 
and... Graphics stolen from Nintendo

Tell me what you think :)

Also during my development I bumped into this picture which probably invoked some insanity to make everything perfect:

http://files.gamebanana.com/img/ss/srends/6469.jpg

edit: forgot to thank the crap out of the sourcemod people for making such a great plugin/modding system (try it, its easy and fun to script mods!) for source games!

**Because there are so many people who missed out on keys, I'm going to see if I can get some more keys to do this again. If not, I'll recycle all of the keys that don't get used this weekend and do a smaller give away.**

Co-Founder of ESEA Eric ""lpkane"" Thunberg was gracious enough to generate 50 1-week ESEA premium codes! Make an account on http://play.esea.net/ and post here with a link to your profile!

http://play.esea.net/users/445898 My profile link, for example.

This is going to be done on a first come, first serve basis. Hopefully if this goes well and generates some traffic for ESEA and competitive CS, then I can get some more codes and do this again for new players!

I'd also like to note that these codes work for CS 1.6, CS:S, CS:GO and TF2 on the ESEA client, but I'm just trying to promote GO as it is the new up and coming game, so you really get a lot for free here!

EDIT: Totally slipped my mind that ESEA also now has a developing European service, so even if you're not a North American player, you can still get in on the action!

**Double Edit: I'm sending the codes via PM on ESEA, not Reddit, so look there and not here!**

TelstarGlitch	55	10	55	"I know a lot of professional players are already scoffing at GO and complaining about it (Saw it in some CSS Gun Game earlier), but I really think the skeptics are looking at this from the wrong perspective.

As a nearly brand-new player to the franchise, I think CS:GO is going to bring in a lot more folks than people think. What we've never had before is the skill-based matchmaking. Having even matches in a Counter Strike game is a gateway for newer players. It made me pick up the game, that's for sure. I love Counter Strike, I just can't break into it because there's so many damn god-teir players out there.

With the matchmaking system, new players can FINALLY get some footing and enjoy the game while honing their skills. This hasn't happened since the mod was first released for Half Life. Maybe the game won't be used in any professional CS tourneys, but what GO will do is grow the franchise and get CS out of the rut it's been in for so many years.

I can't wait to get into matchmaking come the 21st. "	t5_2r5c3	True
1342722693.0	wtvop	Why I love CS:GO	ccasin	59	11	49	"We've all heard that lots of people don't like the CS:GO beta.  I got my key about a week ago and have logged about 25 hours.  I really love the new game, so I thought I'd share an alternate view and highlight some things I don't see being talked about.

A little about my history with CS, first.  I got into the game in late 2001 with some high school buddies, so I've been playing on and off for about 11 years (and have played both 1.6 and source).  When I was younger I was in a few clans and we did OK, but I've never been great.  While this makes me a casual player, I really value the team play aspect of CS.  I love getting up on the mic with a bunch of guys who are really into it, making good calls, executing strategies, etc.  Seeing a good plan come together or effectively responding as a team to changing circumstances is super satisfying, and that's why I play.


**Here are some things I love about the beta**:

* **5v5 match play is the default** - The matchmaking system puts people into 5v5 games.  These games are best of 30 matches (or best of 10, in casual mode).  The system *automatically swaps the teams* after 15 (or 5) rounds.  So, the game now plays much more like a competitive match or an ESEA pug.  I love this, because it really encourages people to focus on team play and complete objectives.  Plus you get to know the other people on your team better - I've already met a bunch of fun players in the beta.

* **Bots are controllable** - If your 5v5 match isn't full, it gets some bots.  This might seem annoying, but they've added an awesome feature here: after you die, you can take control of a bot and keep playing.  So you never get stuck just watching bots play.

* **The dead speak** - In the ""classic competitive"" mode, you can still talk to your team over mic after you die.  This is great, because it's just like you're in vent with your clan or on LAN with your buddies.  You can only view other members of your team after death, so it's not like you can see what the other team is doing and cheat.  But you can tell your team where you died, give strategy advice, etc.  I think this adds a really fun dimension to the game.

* **Molotovs are fun** - I love the incendiary grenades.  They add a cool new strategic tool, and I'm still finding ways to use them.  Awesome way to slow down a banana rush on Inferno, for example!

* **Gun game is built in** - I've never really been a big gun game player, since I play for the teamwork part of CS.  But having it built in is really nice.  I've played a bunch of rounds, since it helps me get familiar with the new weapons.  It's also a great way to warm up or to cool down after an intense match.  The GG mode doesn't have enough maps yet, but the two they've made are nice.  The matchmaking has been doing a great job of putting me in games at my own level, too.

* **Easy to kick problem players** - Some asshole is team flashing?  AFK?  Not following the call?  A simple voting system is built in so you can quickly get rid of problem players.  This has downsides, too, though - more on it later.


**Some things I've seen complaints about**:

* **You can't spray** - I've definitely found that spraying is less accurate in GO than in Source or 1.6.  I'm not sure why people are so upset about this, though - it seems to encourage more careful, strategic play.  How many times have you thrown the mouse in disgust after some idiot spraying at full bore with his MP5 gets a lucky head shot?

* **The models are too hard to distinguish** - I thought this too, for the first 30 minutes.  I quickly got familiar with them, though, and hadn't even thought about it again until I saw a post complaining this morning.  It seems you just have to budget a few hours to get used to them - no big deal, it's a new game.

* **It's too pretty/cluttered/ugly** - There's a certain mentality in some parts of the 1.6 crowd - if they can't run the game at 200 FPS on a 5 year old laptop, it's not fit for professional play.  I don't really get this.  As nice as it would be if I could relive the fun I had with my high school buddies forever, people are going to move on to new games.  I think the maps in GO look really nice, and haven't found them to be too cluttered.  And part of the challenge is supposed to be learning the maps, knowing where to look and how to pick out things.  If I have any graphics complaints, it's that the gun models are chunky and ugly.

* **The movement is clunky** - This seems to be mostly a complaint about earlier iterations of the beta.  I suspect I'm not good enough to really judge, anyway.  I haven't had any problems, though.


**Some complaints of my own**

* **Voting too easy** - In the competitive mode, I think it's too easy to vote for a map change or a team scramble.  Sometimes losing teams will do it out of spite.  And I'd like to try the new versions of all the maps, but every time Aztec or Office or Dust come up we get voted into Nuke or Dust2.  Boring.  I think voting in classic competitive should require a 75% supermajority or be removed entirely.

* **Matchmaking and ranking must be more transparent** - The game gives you a symbolic rating, but there is no way to figure out what the heck it means.  It would be really helpful to get a number (or at least a list of the ratings).  I can't even figure out how well I'm doing!  It would be nice to see how good my opponents are, too.

* **Silence, please** - Please give me my silencers back!  The M4's silencer in particular adds a nice strategic element.  I'm not sure why they took it out.

* **More maps** - Gun game desperately needs new maps, I'm already getting burnt out on the two that are there.  I'm also hoping they'll debut a cool new map or two for the regular game.


That's all I've got.  I really like the game and will be picking it up on release.  I'd love to hear what you think I'm missing, good or bad.  And if any redditors are looking for a match, go ahead and steam friend me:

And does anyone know of any plans at valve to add them into the matchmaking ranked rotation?

[ MAJOR CHANGES ]

- A new game mode has been added to matchmaking and offline play: Deathmatch.

- Weapon balance and recoil were adjusted with pro community input ( Thanks to J3Di, NiP, VeryGames, ESC, 4NOT, mTw, and FM TOXiC )

  - In addition to global changes that affect all weapons, specific adjustments have been made to: rifles, pistols, and the P90.

- Weapon purchasing changes:

  - The AWP's kill reward was increased from $50 to $100.

  - The Glock is now a Terrorist only weapon.

  - The FiveseveN is now a CT only weapon.

  - The Terrorists' molotov price has been reduced to $500. The CT's incendiary grenade remains $850.

  - Note that the pistol arrangement has changed in the buymenu.

 

- The messaging system has been converted to protobuf.

  - Demos recorded with previous versions of CS:GO will not be compatible as of this update. In order to view old demos, set your 'beta' to 'demo_viewer' in the CS:GO betas property panel, in Steam. Don't forget to set it back to 'NONE' when you want to play online again.

  - If you are running SourceMod on your server, you will need to update to the latest version. For details, see: http://www.sourcemod.net/index.php

 

 

[ MINOR CHANGES ]

- Added some performance improvements for low-end clients.

- Fixed some fence materials that were allowing players to see through smoke grenades.

- GOTV spectator UI will now correctly show kevlar and helmet information for players.

- Avatars will now correctly load for all players when connected to a GOTV server or when watching a demo.

- Added support to notify players during servers maintenance downtime.

- Fixed a dedicated server exploit where community dedicated servers could masquerade as official and get players searching for official game modes connected to them (saigns.de)

- Fixed a rare problem when clients matchmaking for Classic Competitive game could be stuck on green Accept screen

- Fixed a rare problem when clients could connect to a Classic Competitive game and then later be disconnected for failing to accept the match.

- Improved algorithm pinging whitelisted dedicated servers when searching for Classic Competitive games, pinging less addresses fixes occasional problems for some customers where address translation tables on their routers would fill up and their routers would fail to route required packets to display the green Accept screen.

- Added support for mm_dedicated_search_maxping to restrict client's ping when matchmaking for Classic Competitive games. ( Matchmaking algorithm will still be prioritizing best servers to minimize ping of all party members. )

- Fixed a rare server crash when bots attempted to shoot the bomb defuser.

- Fixed a client crash when downloading a lot of custom assets from community servers.

I'm sure many of you use aim trainers like [aim400kg](http://aim400kg.ru/en/) or [Reflex.TE](http://www.missionred.com/games/reflexte.html). Me too, but I'm not really satisfied with these two. Aim400kg only has 1 fixed difficulty so for most people it's either too easy or too hard, and Reflex.TE starts really slowly so the first 30 seconds are pretty boring.

So I made my own aim trainer: **[AimBooster](http://www.aimbooster.com/)**. The gameplay is the same, but you can set the difficulty yourself. You can configure pretty much anything really (in training mode). That lets you train exactly what you want, and it helped me quite a lot personally.

The only map we are missing right now is mill, which continues to change and is not in its final release. The goal of this is to help new players, new teams, and puggers be on the same page. 

Links are below, and below those are the notes for each.

**Please note** that I did my best to provide the most common names for these spots. A lot of teams make up their own, and different regions have different names. I worked with a bunch of experienced community members, and polled members as well to find the most common.

**Map Notes**

Any call-out that is a light grey (instead of white) is underneath what the overlay is showing. For example ""Underpass"" on Mirage is underground and below where ladder room connects to catwalk, so it is light grey. Another example is CT Spawn on Dust2 being below Short A.

One spot on a few maps were not named by the many players we polled. We felt they were important calls, and ended up naming them ""close (direction)"" ie. Close Left on Dust2 in B. Close Left outside of T Ramp on Mirage.

Nuke's lower level is separated and accentuated on the bottom left of the image.

Season's overview was pulled from the map .dds file just as the others were, and unfortunately was not made professionally by Valve. It's a bit high contrast but should still suffice.

We only created overviews for the maps that are commonly played competitively. As more maps are completed, we will create new overviews.

**Dust2: Separated Catwalk, Cat, and Short A on purpose. Normally players call all 3 of those the same single name.** We felt it was important that the community start separating those, as there is a huge difference between someone on Short A near A Plat, and someone on Catwalk, just past ""Palm"", and players should be able to easily differentiate. ""Catwalk"" is named such because catwalks are usually thinner just as that area is. ""Cat"" breaks off from Catwalk. ""Short A"" is parallel to Long A, and is indeed shorter.
Added ""Cat Boost"".
Kept ""Palm"" despite the palm tree being removed in GO, as there was nothing there in 1.6, Barrel is used in other areas of the map, and e-pole sounds weird. Actually I kind of like it, you can use that if you want.
Had no solid name for ""B Boxes"". Used ""B Boxes as all other boxes in B were named, and it shares the naming convention with B Doors which is in close proximity. 
Side of Pit and Pit Plat didn't necessarily have names with anyone that we polled, but named them to keep this as comprehensive as possible.

**New Mirage:**
Separated Catwalk and B Cat.
Created E-Stairs to replace E-Box due to landscape change and to differentiate from E-Box at B.
Gave ""Van"" in B a new name as ""Crates"" is unhelpful to newer players unfamilar with previous iterations of the map.
Gave ""Cart"" at the top of middle a new name, as ""Green Box"" is unhelpful to newer players unfamilar with previous iterations of the map.

**Cache:**
B site's ""Corner"" was named instead of ""back site"" or ""deep site"" per the input of several competitive players.
Headshot Box is below Balcony in A, as shown by the light grey text.

**Inferno:**
""Mexican"" or ""Mexi-Pit"" were not used on purpose, and was replaced by ""Underpass"". Deal with it.
We opted to use several Source names as the maps in GO are very similar to Source when compared to 1.6.
""Tri-Box"" from 1.6 is named New Box as it was in Source.
""2nd"" is named 2nd instead of fruit, or oranges because there are no remnants of the source name.
""Patio"" is also Quad for many players.
""Close"" on arch side mid is Close left and had no name according to players we polled.
""Construction"" was chosen over ruins.
""Spools"" were chosen over spindles or coils. We used Spools to stay consistent with other maps.
""Well"", and ""Terrace"" were unnamed previously.
T-Apartments go through to the kitchen area as well. These are low-action areas and are rarely called.
Separated Kitchen and Library.

**Nuke:**
As stated previously we outlined the very transparent lower routes / bomb site and put them in a key on the bottom left of the full image. The main section of the image holds the upper bomb site.
Locker is underneath the red roof that holds Heaven and Catwalk up.
Red is a general call on ramp, meaning down ramp. CT or T ""Red"" are when they are standing in or pushing through the left or right side of red, into lower. There is a catwalk that runs across perimeter of B. Call the catwalk and what is below the catwalk, for example ""Catwalk above Toxic"". Do the same for Rafters in Upper. ie. ""Rafters above Hut"", ""Rafters above Mini"".

**Train:**
A1, A2, and A3 were 4, 5, 6 in 1.6, but are now labelled in GO, and will be 1, 2,3. Some inner trains have been removed in GO, and thus we have removed the lane labels of 1,2,3, and given each train a name. Outside you can also call them 1-Train, 2-Train, 3-Train.
Boilers is also called as ""upper"" but was separated to be more specific.
Up ladder and down ladder can also be ladder room, but were named this way to specify.
Pop Dog was a 1.6 name, and is easier than ""Lower Train"".
E-box is also known as Electric.

**Season:** Green and Blue in the A site had different names, but we felt it would be smart to start using names that pertained to the new map, and are easier to remember."	t5_2r5c3	True

(1) CS 1.6 is extremely old, and you might be turned off by the outdated graphics. It's still a very good game for hardcore CS fans, but that doesn't matter if you're immediately turned off by outdated matchmaking, graphics, or the engine.

(2) CSS (or CS:Source) is older, but still a favorite of many. While its graphics are better than 1.6, it doesn't have some of the nice matchmaking features or official game modes of CS:GO.

(3) CS:GO is the best combination of solid matchmaking, multiple officially supported gameplay modes, graphics, and a newer engine. It may not be true to the original, but that doesn't matter as much if you didn't play the original."	t5_2r5c3	True

To the days of olden, staying up for hours, playing CS and Half-Life with my brother, then 16, and his friends. Counter-Strike, and it's related games, namely Half-Life and Blue-Shift, were my childhood. Sitting on my dad's knee, wondering why we never saw Gordon's face, or why Barney continuously made promises of a beer. 

I really don't know why I'm having such nostalgic feelings right now. Things are changing in my life, but Counter-Strike will always be something I can think back to fondly.

- Added a map overview that displays players, events, grenade detonations, etc. Can be drawn on in a select-able colored pen when spectating or if the ""sv_competitive_official_5v5"" convar is set to 1 on the server or if the client convar ""mapoverview_allow_client_draw"" is set on the client (drawings are not currently networked to other players).
- Added free camera to spectator modes cycle.
clamped hud_scaling to 0.95.
- Added convar 'cl_spec_show_bindings' that toggles the visibility of the spectator key bindings.
- Added spectator ability to toggle competitive scoreboard player data using the 'drop' command.
- Extended team clan name support to the Team Select Screen. To use team clan name, all humans should match their Team name in Games-&gt;Settings, or the server admin can use the 'mp_teamname_1' and 'mp_teamname_2 convars.'
- After halftime, teams no longer switch sides visually on the spectator screen, they now stay where they are and the team colors switch instead.
- Created a server convar that lets you swap the default player side position manually (CTs on right and T's on left) called mp_spec_swapplayersides.
- Made the hotkey that's assigned to jump to a player not change after half-time.
- You can now display a country flag next to your custom team name on the spectator scoreboard by setting ""mp_teamflag_1/2"" to ISO Alpha-2 country code of the country you want to display.
 
### CLASSIC COMPETITIVE 

- Introduced ""Skill Groups"", the new Skill Group emblems are now visible in the main menu and at the end of a competitive match. A players' Skill Group will be displayed after they achieve at least 10 competitive match wins.
- Reworked conditions of valid match leaving: A vote to concede becomes available to the team that lost a player. Otherwise the match continues.
- Number of players searching for a competitive match will display number of players compatible with the game type selected by player, for example players searching for ""Dust II"" will see a number of players searching for ""Dust II"" + ""Defuse Mission"", players searching for ""Defuse Mission"" will see sum of all players searching for ""Defuse Mission"" or any specific defuse map, and so on.
- Estimated wait time for a competitive match now more accurately displays wait time based on the game type selected by player.

### SERVER ADMINISTRATION

- Added Save/Restore of match state.
   - Added convar 'mp_backup_round_file [fileprefix]' -- If set then server will save all played rounds information to files with this prefix. Backup file contains players information like KDA, MVPs, cash, kevlar, helmet, defuse kit, weapons and grenades and match score for first and second halves. In a case of a tournament server crash backup file can be loaded using ' mp_backup_restore_load_file'. The default is 'backup'
   - Added convar 'mp_backup_round_file_last' -- Every time a backup file is written the value of this convar gets updated to hold the name of the backup file.
    -Added concommand 'mp_backup_restore_list_files [number]' -- Lists recent backup round files matching the prefix, most recent files first, accepts a numeric parameter to limit the number of files displayed (default 5).
   - Added concommand 'mp_backup_restore_load_file [filename]' -- Loads the specified backup file and applies players information like KDA, MVPs, cash, kevlar, helmet, defuse kit, weapons and grenades; sets the match score for first and second half and starts next round.
   - Added convar 'mp_backup_round_file_pattern,' that defines the pattern for naming backup files using tokens. Example: %prefix%_%date%_%time%_%team1%_%team2%_%map%_round%round%_score_%score1%_%score2%.txt. The default pattern results in 'backup_roundNN.txt'
- Whitelisted 'mp_logdetail' convar.
- Added convar 'sv_damage_print_enable', that determines whether damage given and received is visible in the console after a player is killed.
- Added 'cl_bobcycle' to 'sv_competitive_minspec'. It's now restricted to the defauklt 0.98 on servers that have 'sv_competitive_minspec' enabled.
- Made all server cash_ convars notify players when they are changed.
- Servers running with sv_pausable 1 will now correctly display 'server paused' UI element on clients when server is paused using 'pause' command.
- Added mp_spectators_max convar to control how many spectators are allowed in a match.
- Added convar mp_halftime_pausetimer that will indefinitely pause the halftime timer.
- Added convar mp_warmup_pausetimer that will pause the warmup period indefinitely. 
 * Warmup periods shorter than 6 seconds cannot be paused.
 
### PERFORMANCE

- Performance improvements for users running on AMD systems.
- Fixed a major performance problem for users running Bitdefender antivirus software.
 
### BUG FIXES

- Fixed two crashes that could happen if you were on a team and went to spectator team.
- Fixed the timer display on the hud still showing even when the bomb was planted.
- Fixed avatar scaling issues on the spectator hud as well as the issues that would place the player slot avatars offset some distance from where they should be.
- Made some adjustments to the specttor UI and regular hud to account for hud_scaling set really high.
Fixed a really bad bug where going from the lobby to a game could prevent players from having input. This would result in not being able to select a team or move around.
- Changed flashbang visual effect in Spectator mode so that it is updated when the target changes."	t5_2r5c3	True

I've played around 10 hours (last few days of Beta and a couple of hours today and yesterday) and the vast majority so far have been one-sided affairs of clan players or good shots demolishing my team. I've won the odd round or two but I'm pretty much exclusively on the losing side which slowly but surely gets frustrating. 

I fully realize that the game needs some data to work with in order to determine my skill, that 10 hours isn't that much, and that matching 5vs5 or 10vs10 players can get a bit complex. However, I feel that several hundred kills/deaths and more than 200 rounds played should at least be enough to not match me with [XXCLANXX]lolHeadshotMidJumpXX every single game. I'm not asking for handouts, I don't want to stomp noobs (impossible since I'm one myself), I simply want fair games. "	t5_2r5c3	True

To train up, we try joining casual lobbies to get some experience. Sad thing is, ALL casual servers (at least those you find with matchmaking) are set to 10v10 player limits, and you get free armor etc.

This is garbage when it comes to proper practice. Why can Valve not implement more variety in their matchmaking options? Why is there no real practice mode that's 5v5, same rules as competitive, without BEING competitive?

Currently the only way to get the pure CS experience is to play competitive mode, meaning you can't leave games until they're totally over, and you have to queue for ages because few people are willing to commit to that.

http://counterstrike.wikia.com/wiki/Counter-Strike_Wiki This one has a basic overview of the games in the series, the weapons, maps etc.. But not much else.

http://cstrikedb.info/wiki/Counter-Strike_Database This one has a bit more information but could use more.

It would be nice if there was a Wiki that also covered the competitive history of CS, and had more information about each map/beta. What if I want to look up who the winner was of CAL-I season 3? Or who were the members of such and such team in 2001? Maybe a list of top teams by year (like GotFrag used to do with its World Rankings).

It would also be nice if along with the patch notes for each beta, there was some exposition on the beta (community response, popular maps, development information).

There could also be a section for strategies, information on rates.

Many old sites that were part of the community CAL / CSNation are now defunct so it is more difficult to find this old information. (apart from using Internet Archive).

I guess if something like this does not exist I would like to see if there is community interest in creating one or would it be worth contributing to one of the existing wikis? Perhaps a wiki isn't even the best option?

To start, I *love* CS:GO.  It's exactly what I wanted Source to be and I'd even go as far as to say that the community has become a better place from it.  However, there's one thing that's really got on my nerves over the years, and even as an adult who's played since high school, I can't stand some of the people in the community who feel like the facade of in-game anonimity is enough to justify shit-talking.


The last competitive match a friend and I were assigned, there was one guy on our team whom we were chosen for, we'll just call him Chu because I forgot his alias in Steam and I don't feel up to checking it out.  He was pretty good, had a quick finger for the Scout, could do a lot of damage when taking point on a narrow rush, but had a particular nature for shit-talking.  My friend (a 30-something married guy with two kids), who plays CS competitive matches on occasion with myself and a few others, had a few bad save rounds during a low spot of the match.  Dear Chu decided he was going to use this opportunity to pick on my friend (paraphraseds):


""Fuck you, you little faggot cunt.  You're just a little skinny fucking faggot with no life and no hope.  You're better off just doming yourself, you little niggerfaggot.  Go kill yourself and hang from a tree, you piece of shit.""


I don't know what it was about his tone of voice, but the way he said it left me profoundly bothered.  I have to clean up shit like him all the time, having been admin on a few Source servers and running my own IRC server, but this guy... he had shit-talking down to an art form.  And the racism didn't help much either.  He sounded at least 15-18 years old, and wouldn't shut the hell up.


Later into the match, the guy declares himself to be the best of the team (ranking third place on our team overall at the time), and when he finally gets told off by the *actual* highest-ranking member of the team, the fucker decides to--in the last round--start spamming all-chat with the positions of our teammates, causing us to lose 14-16.  He then boldly claims to the other team that he had to put up with a bunch of shitty players.  We all told him to go fuck himself, and he (once more) told us to kill ourselves.


I know it's the internet, and I know it's been part of the experience for years, but is shit-talking really necessary?  I'm aware that I'm preaching to the choir by posting it on this sub, because most of you guys are fairly level-headed--it just seems like this guy was the ultimate example of why a lot of gamers know Counter-Strike for its unforgiving mechanics and its fair share of assholes like Chu.

===========
I just renamed the 'SK Gaming 1on1' feature to 'Grilled' when I joined Team Acer, in May of this year, since I didn't want any clashes with SK, in case they decided to continue the feature after my departure.

**Phase 2 - [May 2010 - January 2012]**
===========
Prior to that I took over the 1on1 feature, created by Carmac, during the last year and a half of my three year tenure as the EIC of SK Gaming.

When Carmac and TheSlaSH, my boss at SK, used to run that feature they tended to hover more around run times of 5-15 minutes, and the emphasis was to bring you the person outside of the server/game, their real life more than their gaming career.  I'd already done some long interviews before I took over the feature, so I gradually moulded it into the kind of feature 'Grilled' is now, doing longer interviews and going into great depth about people's careers.

Drop in, shoot some guns, have some laughs, shoot another redditor, and give us feedback on what maps you want to play. We want this to be an interactive server, and we look forward to ~~hearing from you~~ shooting you!


We do appreciate any donation. If you can afford to donate even a dollar or two, and you enjoy your time on the server go [HERE](http://www.gameservers.com/clanpay/?clanid=4e36f0e4c123482e68709762f3445168), and you can make a donation towards the following months costs.

Then I looked back and to why I stopped playing, the reason wasn't that I stopped enjoying it , it was that the servers turned into lowbrow noob fests  where herds of noobs gathered together and required no skill and provided no fun, in the older versions it was as much fun to be a zombie as it was a survivor so even if you had no skill you could still have fun, and thus I stopped playing.

I really want to bring this back , and I need help finding out if the issues i had so much disdain for were server side, community related or specific to the newer versions of the zombie mod, hopefully in time we with an active community we can even host servers specific to our tastes ( I would do this right now if I could assure interest) so all I need you the players , to show a bit of interest and maybe an upvote to help me get this out there to the community.

dota2 introduced solo queue, which only queues you with people that are also alone, there STILL IS A 'normal queue' mode for those that do want to premade.

While it's not a major issue, I feel that the community should be able to voice their opinion on.

Hidden scores were recently introduced as an option for subreddits to enable. How it works is that any new posts will not allow scores to be viewed until some time after posting. The feedback so far has been great and many moderators of much larger subreddits are seeing desirable effects after enabling it.

For more specific information, please read [this post by the Reddit admin Deimorz.](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1dd0xw/moderators_new_subreddit_feature_comment_scores/)

The main reason for this post was so I could link you guys to a survey, but I'd also like some discussion around it. Perhaps we will enable it for a trial period, but before that it would be nice to hear some opinions.

1354486190.0	14630m	[GO] CT vs T balance?	CptArse	23	6	22	"I've been following the pro scene for a couple months and so far the weapon system between the two teams have wondered me quite a bit. In general, CT weapons cost more than T weapons (at least those which are used most often). $3100 M4 vs AK $2700; $2250 Famas vs Galil $2000 etc. On top of that CTs are pretty much forced to buy $400 defuse kits when they have money for them whereas T's don't need anything special to be more effective. However, I don't feel like M4 is $400 better than AK, in some situations I'd say the AK is better than M4 even though it costs a lot less.

**So my question is, what aspect of the game balances out this difference between the teams?** So often I see CTs forced into eco round or to buy famas' when T's can afford AK's for everyone.

Example situation:

* CT wins pistol round.  
* T's eco the second round when CT's buy Famas' because the can't yet afford M4's.  
* The third round can either be: CT's with M4's VS T's with AK's (CT wins 2nd) **OR** CT's on eco round/Famas' vs T's with AK's (CT loses 2nd)

So the third round is pretty much always gun round for Terrorists even when they lose both rounds, whereas CT's most likely need 2 wins in row to afford M4's.

So far I could see CTs getting defender's advantage which could balance things out. However, the map design (how long distance it is for CTs to rotate) + good use of smokes/flashes (removing the advantage of pre-aiming for CT's) could easily negate this advantage and make things equal again. So asking the same question again, where do CT's get an advantage to balance things out?"	t5_2r5c3	True

1353004993.0	1393bm	My change list to competitive mode CS:[GO]	manikfox	22	4	9	"I have a list of things that I think should be changed to the competitive rotation in CS:GO:

1. Warm up should allow buying of weapons for the entire warm up time.  It doesn't make sense to say its been 45 seconds and you cannot buy any more weapons in warm up.

2. Allow the ability to only search for certain maps in the competitive pool when looking for a game.  I played de_dust1 last night 4 times in a row and it's not even a balanced map.   Why not let me choose to play a combination of dust2, nuke, vertigo... etc

3.  Allow community maps to be tested and eventually added to the rotation for more map choices.  This would promote more map makers to make CS:GO maps, and in my opinion what lacks in keeping CS competitive and thriving.  Maybe limit it to already established maps, or some kind of out of game interface for people to vote.  100 votes get it listed in the alpha list, and if enough players vote it in game to be part of the rotation, it will be part of the rotation.

4.  Have more direct documentation on how a player ranks in their ELO rating.  Is it just on amount of rounds/games won, or does score take account?  What about when bots play, the wins/losses don't count towards anything, but you can still get banned for leaving early?

5.  Sometimes killing your team mate is acceptable at the start of round.  A very common example is dust2 where the Terrorists are picking mid and one of their team mates passes in front as the awper shoots.  A second example is a team of friends who really wouldn't care being killed or not at the start of the round and are just fooling around.

6.  As to #3, perhaps update the staple maps, i.e. nuke, to include more balances to even out both halves.

7. While I wait for a match, allow me to play on any community server in the meantime.

8. Push to talk in friend pre-game waiting for a match."	t5_2r5c3	True

They had already been playing for a few days so they were considerably better, but after the first round I was hooked (this was back in either Beta 1 or 2, I'm not sure). I still have fond memories playing Siege for the first time and being able to stockpile guns after the rounds because they wouldn't disappear. Now, 13 years later I'm still casually playing CS:S, and I have pre-ordered CS:GO. It seems like a lot of people have grown up and moved on with their lives since then and the  familiar names and players I had grown up playing with are no longer there.

So how do you feel about Valve working on a game that hasn't received an update for years? Do you think it's good they're still supporting their old titles? Or do you think they should have just left it as it is?

The mod would be simple and just entitle custom server side skins for players and if possible weapons. and a One hit kill system. If you're really willing to get technical add sprites so you can see the balls flying across the map and delay the hit speed. 

Im thinking this is a long shot but i had so much fun on the original mod id love to see it revamped.

So me and a couple of guys are working on a community driven project to help prevent hacking. Project is simple; a server utility that would centralize the ban lists. Also, any user will be able to report a hacker by sending a demo. Many admins are gonna be hawking random pubs to track down hackers. 

As VAC is a good anti-cheat, it is not as fast and some hacks are VAC-proof for a long time. Using this app, ban lists will be updated every hours or so. 

Would you take time to report a hacker?
Server admins, would you find that useful?

Thanks, and feel free to ask any questions.

PS: We don't intend to make any money with this, it's gonna be completely free.

Edit: Just to make it clear, admins will be reviewing submitted bans one by one. Demos will be required and no one will get ban unless we are 100% sure."	t5_2r5c3	True

**Image caption posts**

This issue has come up several times and is quite controversial in several subreddits. Should they be allowed? This isn't r/pics, they don't really add any content, generally they are posted by people looking to gain karma and a policy of allowing them can lead to diluted quality of posts especially as more people start to post crappier images from terrible meme sites.

However, we're all playing a game where we scream at people and call each other n00bs and exchange mother insults. Plus they can be funny when they aren't the only type of submission there is.

**Spam?**

When is it spam? Is it never spam? Is it spam if it's a very low quality site covered in ads? Is it spam if the person who submitted it appears to be affiliated with the site?

**Sidebar**

Thus far I've added several community groups and servers to the sidebar (anyone who has asked) ----&gt;

At what point will this become overwhelming or useless? Should there be any criteria for who gets added? The sidebar isn't exactly an ideal server browser. Should we just link to a self-post or something that can contain more details?

I used to play a lot of 1.6 back in highschool but dropped off as I just never really got serious with it. Source came out, and I found myself frustrated with the shenanigans (especially with the riot shield). CS GO finally comes out and my mind was pretty much blown. I found that everything I hated about CSS was gone but everything I loved still there. Plus it had the gun feeling of 1.6 that I vaguely remembered. CSS was too sprayey.

But here is my question, I feel like most people who did adopt CS GO feel like me, but why aren't more people moving in droves to CS GO? I read posts online of pros still sticking to 1.6, or disliking CS GO. Or am I just misinterpreting the scene? Can something be done on either Valve's or the communities part to help the transition? Or a more deeper question, is it just a lost cause and should I just go back to playing 1.6 rather than investing time in CS GO?

Disclaimer: I am seriously not trolling, these are honest questions that I wonder about the game.

[INTERVIEW STARTS AT AROUND 1:13:00]

Very interesting interview on HeatoN's part since he is a CS legend. Heaton had many good points about what is needed in order for CS:GO to become as competitive as it used to be, if not more. 

2 main things he wants to see changed:
1. Get rid of bullet tagging [Seeing bullets in the air]
2. Louder, more clear sound. 

He feels there is potential of seeing CS:GO become the new Counter-strike for eSports, and dreams it will be as big as the competitive games of today (Starcraft 2, LoL, Street fighter). But in order to accomplish this it will take a combination of effort from Valve, the players, and the community. Not to mention NiP (Ninjas in Pyjamas) WILL be playing CS:GO, which is a huge plus in my eyes.

There's been quite a few 'how do I improve my game?' posts lately, so I thought I'd share with you a few maps which I use to help my aim. Deathmatch/bots/scrims/pub are all great ways to improve, but sometimes it's nice to just relax and do something different.

[training_aim3](http://files.gamebanana.com/maps/training_aim3_2.rar) 

[training_aim2](http://files.gamebanana.com/maps/_9139-.rar)  

training_aim2 is a map I've used for a little while now, but training_aim3 is the updated version which I only downloaded and tried today. So far I'm liking it, it has a lot more options and 'modes'.

**Edit:** I recommend training_aim3 now. You can tweak the target size to 'head', which I strongly recommend.


This is essentially target practice. If anyone is familiar with the older muscle memory maps with dots on a wall, that you continually flick or smoothly aim between, this is a similar concept but a lot better (IMO).

Targets appear on the front wall, you shoot them. There's options you can change including how quickly they appear and how long they appear for and whether they're stationary or moving. You can shoot at varying distances and while moving around.

It's all pretty self explanatory, but jump on and play around. Set goals to continually beat your own score, and then jump onto some DM or bots afterwards and see if it helps you.

Enjoy! :)

I made surf_mdx, and the last level in surf_zelda_v2. surf_mdx a freestyle surf map with a secret hidden skate park that you can also surf. You can see a random video of it in action here: 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MnjwUFrloc&amp;t=1m8s

I have 2 very ambitious projects left that I want to finish but often lack the motivation because surfing is for the most part dead. Well to be honest, 1.6 isn't what it used to be either. 

The first one, and the one I've put the most work into is an epic level map. It's got a realistic theme, and many original level designs that haven't been done yet. It's very near completion, with just some minor bug fixes on the very last level.

The second is a freestyle map on the top, with what's going to be a short freestyle level type map on the bottom half. It has custom textures and goes for a stylized look inspired by Mirrors Edge. 

You can see screenshots of both maps here: http://imgur.com/a/C5I4B

So who still surfs and would they be interested in the maps being finished? 

Ohh and for those interested in playing the maps I mentioned above

Like I said, the action would depend on the situation (maybe you see an awper holding down an angle, and he becomes the priority, or you run into a player who you know has the most skill on the opposing team), but in general, what do you think is the best way to handle such a situation?

EDIT: I just wanted to say, that while many of the responses have good advice, the situations that i'm referring to are when you are right by the enemy, in the thick of it.

I have played CS since 1.5. My favorite was 1.6 and I'm glad a lot of people share that sentiment here. I stopped playing around summer of 2011 and that was the CS:S. Is GO that much different? What are your opinions on it? I read up about it as much as I could but it is still nice to get the answers personally. 

Also, I hate lag and I don't want to buy GO if my laptop can't run it very well. Below are the specifications, how do you think I would be able to run the GO? Will I have any issues?

Lenovo Y580

Nvidia Geforce GTX 660M

Intel Core i7-3630QM 2.40GHz

Windows 8 x64

8GB of RAM

and plenty of space on the hard drive.

EDIT: So I just dove in and played in a pug, you guys were not kidding the skill level on esea is WAY better then in normal pugs, i had a hard time breaking even and was at the bottom of the team, but my teammates were nice and helped me out a bit so I will definitely be playing some more games tonight.

I've been pretty tempted to buy 1.6 to get the... ""purest"", most competitive CS experience, but I'm unsure... is it still, well, worth buying? I've heard a lot of sketchy things about it, how a lot of the servers are just filled with mods and don't use official/good maps (e.g. every server is gungame, zombies etc.) so it can be very hard to find good, ""original"" servers, is this true? I'd be mainly playing in Australian servers too, any idea what they're like?

And also, what's the general skill level like? I consider myself fairly decent at CS, but I'm still very much new to the game, and sometimes when I'm up against veterans the game seems nigh on impossible. Are there still a fair amount of ""bad"" players in 1.6? Or are most of the players veterans who'll headshot me in less than a second around a corner?

I'm playing as much as I can, but I'm not getting any better at it. It's becoming an exercise in frustration. What am I doing wrong? Should I post demos? I'm really at a loss here. What can I do to get over the hump and not suck?

I am here representing Team Decode. We are a UK gaming team who at the moment have a League of Legends team. We are looking to pick up a CSGO team as we feel that it is time to expand.

We currently have one main sponsor and are soon to have a second. Our first is InteractHosting who are providing us with web hosting. Our second (hopefully) will be providing us with a Teamspeak 3 voice server and (hopefully) a game server for a CSGO team.
As an organisation, we have just started hosting UK LoL tournaments which have been positively received by the community. We aim to do this everyweek in order to grow the community and the League seen. Furthermore, we aim to attend iSeries in august.

With this information, if you, and your team, think you could be part of Team Decode, feel free to add me on steam: bhosford293 or Skype bhosford123 in the hope that we can discuss our future!

Thanks,

Decode Hoss

1364413304.0	1b4nqj	[CSS]Hosting a 1v1 Tournament if anyone's interested on March 30th (There are also prizes and no buy ins (Server Located in Dallas, TX)) Info below:	ThePhar	13	2	8	"1V1 SE ""Day before Easter"" CS:S Westwood Tournament 

No of Players: 16
Type: Single Elimination

Description:
Hello and welcome all to Darkened Alliance's 4th annual tournament! We wanted to try and get a tournament started up in January, but that unfortunately did not happen. However, we are now all good to go this time and just before April.

This will be a Player VS Player Single Elimination (1 Loss and you're out!) tournament in Counter-Strike: Source, a game I hope you're familiar with. The map will be played on a modified version of de_westwood, one that is optimized and has the dust cloud removed to help players perform. I have chosen this map for it's size and because it is a great even sided map (especially for 1v1s). If you haven't played it, you can pick up a version of de_westwood off gamebanana to get a feel for it or hop in our Tavern (pub) server and nominate the modified version (de_westwood_phar) it to give it a shot.

The rules are really simple. 2 players will enter the designated server at the time their matches begin. A brief introduction will follow with the commentators and the match will begin. First up is a knife round. The winner of the knife round gets to pick the beginning team. After this, they both move to their teams and begin. First person to win 6 matches is declared the winner. Also, they will both switch teams after the 5 first rounds. There are no buy restrictions and both players start with 1200$. 2:30 minutes per round and 3 second freeze time. In the event of a tie (5-5), a sudden death round is played with 16k$ and 2:00 minute round time (3 second freeze time).

Hacks and cheats are obviously not permitted and we hold to right to disqualify anyone suspected of hacking or cheating without giving a reason. Also, no being a douche and play friendly.

There will be a total of 16 players, so a maximum of 15 matches at a maximum of 30 minutes per match for tournament time from 1 hour to 6 hours if everyone shows. Only one match will be going on at a time (mostly due to lack of free staff at the moment), and anyone not up can watch the tournament via SourceTV. All Drknd Allinc servers will be down for free resources reserved for the tournament. The server is hosted in Dallas, TX USA.

The tournament will be managed via the Drknd Allinc TeamSpeak (if you don't have TeamSpeak download it from www.teamspeak.com), in channel (Events Channel) on March 30st, 18:00 GMT (Use a converter to find your timezone). Contestants must show up 15 minutes before tournament begins or they will be disqualified.

1st Place will receive 50$USD, 2nd Place will receive 25$USD, and Semi-Finalists 10$USD each. This is transferred via a PayPal gift or Steam gift (Any number of games that equal the amount won). No buy in so join before they're full.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the tournament, feel free to msg me about it or leave a comment below and I will get to you as soon as I can. Also, feel free to join in any discussions we have going on at our forums or hop in our TS and chill with us. Thanks for reading.

* Introduction to this post
* But why?
* Taking your suggestions
* Asking for your help
* TL;DR

**Good day to you,**

It has long been my strategy to let this subreddit essentially run itself. In fact, this post is my first official act of [M]oderation. I merely act as a spam filter clearer, removing items wrongly held by the spam filter.

I suspect we're about to see an influx of new users--in fact we already are--so I'm going to ask you to run this subreddit even more by asking for your suggestions on potential rules and your assistance in moderation.

**Aww, why do we have to change anything, why did you even make this post?**

So far this August /r/CounterStrike has had more visitors, views, subscriptions, and posts than any month in history.

July: 300 unique visitors per day, 1,300 page views per day, 10 new subscribers per day.    
This week: 3,000 unique visitors per day, 10,000 page views per day, 80-150 new subscribers per day.

I'm sure this will drop-off some... Well, I'm kind of sure. Or it could increase another tenfold next week when GO is released.

**Suggestions?**

Today, /u/ukbulmer messaged me with an awesome suggestion: put something in the side-bar that prompts submitters to include the game they're referring to similar to how other subreddits self-tag their posts. [CSS], [1.6], or [GO] for example, to tip readers off about which game that submission refers to.

I don't think I'll make it a *requirement* (at least not at this time) but I think it would be a good suggestion because not everyone is interested in all the versions. You'll see more about that in the coming days, probably in the form of a bold note on the submission page where you enter the title.

Does anyone else have suggestions? Rule ideas? Leave it up to self-government like in the past? Don't worry, we're not going to make any significant changes very quickly. I'm just looking for suggestions here and listening to feedback.

**Taking fire, need assistance!**

I'm the only mod. I used to be unemployed and watching the spam filter 24 hours a day and responding to the 1 message every couple of months was no problem. However, I work 40+ now in an environment that doesn't allow sites like reddit to be accessed and as I mentioned above, we're growing exponentially.

Do you have mod experience, want to help? I'm almost afraid to ask this because I don't want to turn anyone down and I'm sure I'll get too many volunteers, but it's for the good of the community.

Helping is pretty easy, just check to make sure no one is stuck in the spam filter periodically throughout the day. Maybe enforce rules from the section above if we decide to implement any.

If you're interested please ~~[fill this out](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGFvMmlzUW1VOEFPbWN4WUJuc1llYmc6MQ#gid=0)~~ so I can help keep things organized in one place. Please include details about why you're qualified, what time of day you're on, your reddit activity level, etc.

Leonard_Laney	13	0	45	"I really miss the way the AWP used to work before they updated it in 1.6. They basically doubled the delay time that dictates how soon you can shoot the AWP after you've equipped it. I understand why they did it but it was just a lot more fun.

I also really miss the gameplay from 1.3. The delay times for all the weapons were much shorter so as soon as you pulled out a weapon a split second later you shoot it. Also pistols and SMGs were relatively accurate in mid air and you could bunny hop without being slowed down while landing. 

And I miss the animation bugs some of the weapon models had. For instance: if you rapidly switched between the deagle and the AWP the equip animations would stop playing.

One of the newer features I like was the update of the terrorist auto sniper. They turned it into the ultimate noob cannon. They made it stronger, more accurate, and the first shot is always accurate in midair. Nothing more satisfying than midair autosniper headshots."	t5_2r5c3	True

1376586729.0	1kfgz4	[GO] Skin trading support added to Bazaar.tf	Fiskie	12	0	0	"Hi, I'm the developer of [Bazaar.tf](http://bazaar.tf). I knew CS:GO trading was coming for a long time, so I've kept support for it ready.

However, I've had to make a few changes to accommodate skins. For one, the GO schema is almost useless so I've had to switch to using the Community inventory APIs to get weapon data. Not too much of an issue, but it means that the amount of items you are able to wishlist will be tiny until more inventories are parsed on-site. If you haven't got anything better to do it'd be nice if you could go through other people's backpacks on the site so the wishlist library fills faster.

Another thing - if you're completely uninterested in TF2 or other games (like I expect a lot of you to be), you can hide most of this by setting CS:GO as your preferred game in the settings menu.

If you're aware of our automated trading feature Buy Now, please note that new CS:GO items won't fully work with it just yet. I haven't tested it, but I know support for it isn't there. I'll be working on this tonight.

I'll be monitoring this thread for feedback since the system is barely tested - I will be making a lot of improvements since I actually enjoy CS.

Yarcofin	16	3	10	"I just took the jump last night from casual to competitive games, and along with it came a LOT of new terminology players are throwing around that I had never heard before in casual games. Can someone give me a definitive list of what all these mean, so I can learn them all and not seem like an idiot for several more matches?

For example (warning, some of these are going to sound pretty stupid probably):

**Long / Go Long** - Does this mean A-site, and short is B-site? Long and short lanes like in Dota/LoL? Does it change by map?

**Mid** - Somewhere between A and B site? There doesn't seem to be an actual mid lane on some maps?

**Tunnels / Watch Tunnels** - When people say tunnels on Dust II, do they just mean ground-level hallways and rooms? Because I have never seen actual underground tunnels on Dust II like there are on Militia for example

**Catwalk** - On Dust II this seems to just be a sidewalk that goes above a lower road? Is there a catwalk on each map? I was expecting a big metal grated industrial catwalk way up between buildings the first time I heard it.

**T-Side / CT Side** - Is this just a half of the map, or more specific ie. in each side's spawn area?

Any others?

Also if you can give me some general strategy for playing competitive... half the time I hear ""RUSH RUSH RUSH RUSH NEVER STOP RUNNING JUST KEEP GOING. YOU LET YOUR TEAM DOWN BY STOPPING"", this usually just results in our whole team suiciding into the other team in a giant wave. The other half of the time I hear ""OMG DO YOU PEOPLE ****ING KNOW HOW TO WALK"". Also apparently running into a hiding place your teammate is in when enemies spot you is very bad and you will get schooled about it through voice chat for a full minute. Any others?"	t5_2r5c3	True

1360626077.0	18ca41	[GO]Looking for map maker for hire	d3vaLL	16	4	11	"http://i.imgur.com/BkD2MrR.jpg

This is concept I've had in my head for years. I crudely drew it out. I was hoping to get some general feedback and possibly find a map maker. Thanks for the gander.

Notes:

1. The 1's and 2's on the boxes represent the height: waist high vs. head height.

2. The ""rocks"" area is meant to be a death plunge and the terribly represented waterfall leads to this death. I'll need to have the rocks accessible in case of a bomb drop in the area.

3. The window in the bombsite barn is meant to link to the bombsite near the boat if the jump is long enough. This should be the only access from left and right upper shelves.

4. The water is only meant to be waist high in all areas. The submerged aqua object in the waterslide is an option sniper spot.

5. The map itself is not meant to be very large or complicated. I want to keep the spawn points simple to resist spawn camping (trees don't provide real cover). I want the points of conflict to be mid range and the long range areas being mostly for moving to a position. The interior areas are to be kept very simple. All of this is to keep movement very fluid and unique concepts are to allow for escape and flanking in all areas (benefiting quick thinkers and higher odds of clutch situations)."	t5_2r5c3	True
