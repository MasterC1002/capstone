**EDIT 322: 7:43PM** He is on the boat.  Center mass is leaned towards the fence line.  He is inside the stern - or maybe the gastank is inside the stern.  Half full tank with 20 gallons of fuel.  Unsure if the suspect is trying to get to it.  
**EDIT 321: 7:42PM** Confirmed movement in the boat from multiple sources.  Confirmed movement in the boat.  
**EDIT 320: 7:40PM** There is a full tank on the boat.  20 gallons of fuel on the boat.  Helicopters overhead say there is movement in the boat.  Asking for spotlights on the boat.  
**EDIT 319: 7:40PM** There is quite a bit of movement in the boat.  He is sitting up and moving.  
**EDIT 318: 7:39PM** SORRY!  It wouldn't let me make a new post in /r/news so I had to make one here.  I don't know why.  
**EDIT 317: 7:32PM** They are working to meet up around the back of the house.  They almost have the top of the boat ripped off.

I could barely wait until this evening to dig up my buried treasure.  I had pondered opening the letter before going to work, but I didn't want to tease again.  I decided to film the entire event for everyone to see.  Here are the links to the imgur albums and YouTube video:


http://imgur.com/a/73ft8#0 


http://imgur.com/a/aT8NL#0 


http://youtu.be/-AYUVFZdcEU




The results:


Step one was opening the letter to myself.  To my surprise, I didn't even write myself a note.  Instead, I drew myself a detailed map of my parents neighborhood with an X in the location of the box.  I even wrote out their address in great detail as if I would forget my childhood home.  This map was essentially useless.  I placed the X in a rough estimate of the proper location on their lot, but without the aid of a metal detector I would have been digging for quite a while.


The search only took about 15 minutes thanks to my friend Mike and his metal detector and due to recent rain, the ground was soft.  I was able to dig the box up fairly quickly.  We learned a few things about the effects of burying items for 20+ years.  Namely, a metal lunch box does not make for a good barrier from the weather and neither does duct tape.  Imagine that.  Also, Ziploc brand bags may not survive the apocalypse. 


The box was, in fact, a Dukes of Hazard lunch box.  No thermos, sorry.  This one won't be on the auction block any time soon.  It was badly deteriorated and rusty but you could still make out some characters and the General Lee.


What was in it?  Well, the video shows all, as do the pictures, but I'll try to provide a bit more detail here.  


The first item was the NY Yankees hat.  This is the one article I remembered being in there.  It was a gift from a fellow fan that lived in NY.  He bought it at Yankee stadium (along with a few others) and sent them to me.  This one was badly faded though so I never wore it.  The cotton on the hat had long ago rotted away.  What was left was the nylon bill and strapping that holds the hat together.  


On the bill of the hat I found a barely recognizable picture of my family.  It was a family portrait of my parents, sister, and I. 


There was also a plastic card holder with four Don Mattingly cards inside.  I was a huge Mattingly fan in those days, so no surprise here.  The oldest card was from the 91 season, so this seems to confirm that I buried this in 1992 when I was 13.  I have no other way of dating the burial other than memory... which is obviously already flawed.


That's it.  I'm fairly certain that I had written myself a letter, but it did not survive.  It's very possible there were other things in that bag but I'll never know for sure.  Although I didn't uncover some long lost keepsakes, this was an immensely rewarding experience for me.  I learned a great deal about who I used to be compared to who I am now.  Having my children with me on this journey made the experience that much more special.  I have a feeling that we will be doing this again soon. ;-)


Thanks for accompanying me on this adventure!

First though, some family lore.

My grandparents met at an April Fools' Day dance at college in Oklahoma, during the early 1940's.  They were dancing to a live band when my grandfather cut in and began dancing with my grandmother.  When the band finished their set, my grandmother said, ""I'm tired from dancing.""  My grandfather replied, ""I'm Joe from Tulsa.""  And she married him.

Fast forward about 68 years.  My grandfather had Alzheimer's, and his condition had been deteriorating rapidly over the last week.  He passed away one morning with my grandmother at his side.  The assisted living center notified my uncle (their oldest son), and he got there as soon as he could.  When the funeral home came to take my grandfather's body away, my grandmother held her husband's hand one last time, looked at him and said, ""Tired from dancing.""

Here's hoping we all get to experience the kind of relationship my grandparents had."	t5_2qjbr	True

Since this post actually got some press [here](http://www.holesinthenet.co.il/archives/52846) and [here](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/158039#.UAgxMrQtjeB). They contacted the actual photographer and he said he has what to say on the matter. We may soon have a full, 2 sided story =)

**preface**

This is an update of [this](http://i.imgur.com/edFu0.jpg) picture. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/wp10x/settlers_make_fun_of_the_palestinian_woman_after/) are the reddit comments. And [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/wp10x/settlers_make_fun_of_the_palestinian_woman_after/c5f7v9x) is my comment that stirred some nice conversation that I enjoyed greatly =)

ok. So this update is an attempt at giving a lot of information. The picture gave very little information, and led me to investigate further. I knew one of the kids so I sent him an email and I will go through the response in the update. 

I'd like to add, that the picture is kind of a scary and criminalizing picture, and the 'truth' isn't so much better. It can be taken either way, but it definitely is not 100% positive. 


**BACKGROUND INFORMATION**

*Sheikh Jarrah*- Sheikh Jarrah is a strip of houses in East Jerusalem that used to be Arab owned. In August 2009, the Israeli courts decided that this strip of land is actually Jewish owned. I don't know the details of the court case, but that was the conclusion. 

Before you yell at Israel for being racist or an apartheid state or whatever, I want to direct your attention to the recent incident of the Ulpana community. This past month, some Arabs made a claim the the Jewish Community of Ulpana was settled on Arab owned land, and took them to court. It made it up to the Supreme court, and they ruled that the Arabs were correct. They forcefully evicted the Jews, and now the Arabs live their happily. 

So before you condemn Israel for evicting Arabs; just know that they evict Arabs, Israelis, Jews, whomever. They evict those who they think legally don't own the land. 

Anyway, back to Sheikh Jarrah. So what happened is the courts ruled that it is Jewish owned, and instead of forecfully evicting them, like they did in Ulpana, they allowed them to pay rent and stay. Some of the tenants refused to pay rent, so like any tenant who doesn't pay rent, they were evicted. But some of the families stayed. 

So it was at that point that this picture was taken. When a bunch of the houses already had Jewish families in them, and the Arab families who were willing to pay rent were still there. 

*Jerusalem Day*- Jerusalem day is a modern holiday that was established to commemorate the day Israeli captured The Old City of Jerusalem in 1967, during the six day war. It was captured from the Jordanians after Israel was attacked by 4 neighboring Arab nations and Israel did particularly well in that war (that's a massive understatement). In addition to The Old City; Israel also captured the Golan Heights, Gaza Strip, Sinai Peninsula, East Jerusalem. (On a side note, Sinai and Gaza were both given back in exchange for a promise of peace. Both in Sinai and in the Gaza strip, there were Jewish communities that were forcefully evicted by Israel). 

If Israel got a bunch of places back, how come we don't commemorate those as well? How come it's not called ""Golan Heights day""? Well, simply because Jerusalem is the capital of Israel so its unification is a big deal. Also, even if it wasn't the capital. Jerusalem is the heart of the Jewish people, and has been for thousands of years. We pray every day to be able to come back to Jerusalem. So logically, when we DO have the ability to come back to Jerusalem, it's kind of a big deal. It's the first time, since it was owned by the British, that a Jew set foot into the Old City.

So how does Israel commemorate Jerusalem day? Well, just like all other holidays or super bowl wins in America, we have a parade! The parade starts at King George street, continues down Jaffa street and into the Jaffa gate of the old city. The parade continues to wind through the Jewish quarter of the old city (as opposed to the Arab, Christian, and Armenian quarter). The parade ends with a giant concert at the Western Wall. 

Due to the simplistic nature of the day that we are celebrating a victory, it also means that other people are commemorating a loss so, there are constantly spats between riled up Israelis looking to shove their victory down some peoples throats, and Arabs who are pissed of at these people. 

**ACTUAL STORY BEHIND THE PICTURE**

So obviously, it looks like these kids are surrounding the Palestinian women taunting her. Right? So I emailed the kid I know from the picture (the second from the right. yeh. that guy). So here's his response:

&gt;Ya I know it. I've seen this picture. This isn't the first time that it's popped up on reddit. It's false propaganda. The guy is clearly a good photographer and caught our faces (mostly mine) at exactly the right second. The truth is It was yom yerushalayim [Jerusalem Day] and we were singing in a part of yerushalayim [Jerusalem] that was recently resettled by Jews [Sheikh Jarrah]. Singing and celebrating. And the Arab woman came out banging with a metal stock on a pot trying to interrupt out celebration so we were just raising our voices and singing louder as she came into our faces. We were not screaming at her or mocking her. We were just trying to continue our celebration that she is trying to interrupt. And what's not show in the picture is a few more women banging on pots as well. She came to us. We didn't move at all. In fact, we're not even so close to her, the pictures angle just makes it seem that way. 

&gt; recently resettled by Jews

I'd like to comment on that part of his email and explain a little. Remember what I said above about what Jerusalem Day was celebrating? That Jews were once again allowed into Jerusalem? So logically, if something close to that main occurrence happens recently, that is thrown into the celebration

moving on.

ok. So this is a little better, I think. He says the they weren't mocking her at all, and that she approached him. **I'd like to add here, that obviously this is a two sided issue, that I only have one side for. I wish I had the Palestinian woman's side but, unfortunately, I don't. So yes. I'm giving a VERY one sided view, and just know, that I do understand that.**

Anyway. So I emailed him back and asked a question:

&gt;if it was Jewish, why was she there? was it fully re-settled yet?﻿

(at this point I haven't researched Sheikh Jarrah yet. 

his response:

&gt;I think only part of it was resettled by Jews. We took a tour of a house there and went on the roof that overlooks the whole area and then went down sang and danced. That's when she showed up from behind a fence across the street protesting. 

So here he goes further. That the women was behind an enclosed private area, and came out simply to protest against the celebration. 

So I told him that I was going to make a post like this, so he said:

&gt;A big response to anyone can be, and I can say this because I was there clearly, was that when this was happening the singing in dancing, the Arab media wasn't only taking pictures. They were also taking video. So we can turn around and ask, why is there only one still shot picture with a caption? Must be 1) they only caught our faces in one bad pose for one second because we really were singing and dancing and 2) they can't release the video because that will reveal the truth, that we were singing and dancing. But if they take one picture and distort it with a false caption, they capture the media. The video and all other pictures were probably destroyed. 

I personally think that those are valid questions. Am I right?

Anyway. In summation; according to this kid. They were singing and dancing, as per the norm on Jerusalem day, when this Palestinian women advanced towards them, meaning she was the active one, they didn't actively seek her out. She was banging the can trying to protest the celebration, and they didn't stop, and the picture was snapped. 

Again. I give this from a strictly one sided view. That doesn't mean that it's wrong, it's just something to keep in mind.

If there's anything that needs to be clarified, let me know and I'll post an update. 



**tl;dr** they weren't mocking her. They were celebrating a holiday and she approached them banging the metal thing protesting their legal celebration. They continued to sing and dance as they were doing prior to her intervention. No harassment.  "	t5_2qjbr	True

[1] http://www.zodiackillerciphers.com/?p=179

Here is what I figured out. I added the lines, then added each subtotal. It equals 418. Here is the significance of that number, as far as I can find (Aleister Crowley called it Abrahadabra):

[2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahadabra

Here is how I got 418. Using the Zodiac Killer's code (see above), I listed the mathematical difference between each number, reading downward in vertical lines in order (as if it were Japanese and not English). The first integer is the mathematical difference, the second integer, aka after the [:], is how many times it occurred in a row. The totals of these numbers, with their appropriate positive or negative attributes, gave me a subtotal for each line. These subtotals, also both positive and negative, equaled 418.

Total is + 418 (From the sum of individual lines' totals.)

Here is some of what the Wiki article says about Abrahadabra and 418:

""ABRAHADABRA has 11 letters ABRAHADABRA = 1+2+2+1+5+1+4+1+2+2+1 = 22 The five letters in the word are: A, the Crown; B, the Wand; D, the Cup; H, the Sword; R, the Rosy Cross; and refer further to Amoun the Father, Thoth His messenger, and Isis, Horus, Osiris, the divine-human triad. Also 418 = ATh IAV, the Essence of IAO, translated from Hebrew as “Thou art IAO” 418= BVLShKIN, or Boleskine 418= RA HVVR, or Ra Hoor 418= הרו-רא-הא, a Hebrew spelling of Heru-Ra-Ha 418= AIFΑΣΣ, a Greek spelling of Aiwass 418= The sum of all integers between 13 and 31 inclusive. Abrahadabra is from Abrasax, Father Sun, which = 365 [10] 418 = 22 x 19 Manifestation""

Notice the 22x19=Manifestation, which is the number of times the difference of 22 occurred in line 1, only. The other lines had it reoccurring in even amounts each.

*Edit:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square

If you add the numbers (not the differences, but the actual numbers) in any direction, it adds up to 4641. 
The number .4641 happens to be a constant multiplier in mathematics (equal to dividing by the constant, 2.1557), in relation to finding three equal circles within a larger circle.

This does in fact seem to be a ""circle squared"" (not that that really means anything).

EDIT: I looked up the 800+ pg. FBI file where this magic square was from. Also in there were a couple of photocopies of detailed pictures of someone practicing Thelema (robed magician sitting in a pentagram, etc), from a book or other publication.

I looked up every older alphabet I could find, and though some of the Greek and Latin symbols I found were similar to those in the 340 Zodiac cipher, nothing matched up so much as that of Thelema. Yes, it has its own alphabet—and a very ambiguous one at that. Thelema has two alternates for every letter, and uses pictures. Many of the pictures matched up to the Zodiac's.

So in fact, I think maybe his code was taken from the Thelema alphabet. My guess is that back in the day, this alphabet was not readily available (thanks to the internet). Here it is:

http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b314/ThanatEros/Illuminati/IlluminatiCiphersORIGINAL.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.heruraha.net/viewtopic.php?p%3D27378&amp;h=799&amp;w=440&amp;sz=43&amp;tbnid=hX0V0aOCWcxr4M:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=50&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__vUq-k6U-998fikrcs-TI4r1lT0Y=&amp;docid=TOvW9PoLjPzt6M&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=alUfUcWzKIqniAK51oDIDg&amp;ved=0CDgQ9QEwAg&amp;dur=676

By replacing only about half of the symbols (and not taking liberties or replacing those which did not have a clear alternate), Here is what I found in the 340 cipher:

I am nowhere near done, and am not even sure if I can finish. I am thinking someone who is better at Cryptography could figure the rest out. I have a good head start though....who knew this gibberish was actually a real written alphabet.....

There definitely appear to be backwards words in groups. I am not sure if G3 is a thing. It definitely sounds like the writer is taunting policemen in this, and perhaps is a GI himself?
MDHN is a common acronym for ""Mater Dei Holy Name.""

He didn't have any friends and he was an easy target. He always talked about ""baby things"" like karate and ninja turtles. (TMNT had peaked in popularity three or four years earlier, so my 5th grade mind decided they were now ""for babies."") This was no ordinary bullying. We called him names and pushed him around like what happens to anybody going through school; we also threw stones at him, kicked him when he fell down, kicked dirt in his face, and hit him with sticks. He cried almost every time. We made sure to never do it when there were teachers or playground monitors around. Even so, I don't know if he never told on us or if the the faculty just didn't care.

He and my friend moved away at the end of the school year. I never once gave any thought to what we did to that kid until maybe 7th or 8th grade. It started to bother me more and more. During college, I tried to find out where he was so I could apologize. Maybe he just decided it was schoolkid antics that everyone goes through and it didn't have an effect on him later in life. But I keep thinking about how horrible it was, so I have no reason to doubt he does, too.

I was able to find out where his parents moved to, but when I went to apologize, a different family lived there. I haven't been able to find out since.

So consider this my open apology to the ether. I didn't know what I was doing when I was that young, but I know now and I feel terrible for it."	t5_2qjbr	True

1334991938.0	sl0me	Fuck you Comcast, you piece of shit.	TSammich	105	15	15	"My Comcast internet has suffered packet loss for over two months now. I can't do shit online without randomly being cut off by the biggest trololol in the world. This includes trying to talk to Comcast customer representatives on XFINITY chat. I can't even get a ticket escalated before my internet dies. Two weeks ago I scheduled a tech to come out and figure out what was going on with my service. When he arrived he promptly tested BOTH of my modems (one is a backup) and my router and confirmed that they are infact working fine. I have ran pingtest(s) through command prompt to my hardware manually to confirm that there is zero packet loss between my hardware and my computer. After the tech confirmed that my hardware was fine he ran off down the road to take of a look at some of the amplifiers in my neighborhood. Low and behold he returned 5 minutes later with something he ""just had to show me"". So I follow him down the road to an amplifier located on my side of the street. If you don't know what an amplifier is take a look at this. (http://9-1-1.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Snap811.jpg) Anyway, as we approach he explains that my amplifier has been broken for months now, and suddenly the cable running up the power pole and across the street to the amplifier on the other side made total sense. Instead of fixing this issue Comcast has jury-rigged power from the amplifier across the street and as soon as rush hour kicks in instead of my side of the street being out of internet, the entire neighborhood is kicked offline. Oh, and by rush hour I mean almost any time during the day or night. The internet drops hourly, sometimes for 15 seconds, sometimes for 4 hours.

So I have spend at the least 3 hours with Comcast tech support explaining my issue. I would say about 15% of my total calls have resulted in someone who isn't reading troubleshooting lines off of the F.A.Q supplied with their job. Just about every employee wants to tell me that they see no interruptions in my service over the past weeks and the connection is working fine now so they can't help. That or they want try and troubleshoot my hardware. I have tried to work around this by using the XFinity live chat, but it's kind of hard to get this entire issue across before my internet drops and I lose connection. The tech that came out to my house told me quite bluntly that there was nothing he could do and the problem would have to be solved by a tech level above him. He wouldn't outright say it but I got him to confirm that it could be months before the issue is fixed. It's not uncommon for this type of problem to go unsolved for an extended period of time.


This shit is not acceptable Reddit, cable companies have monopolized areas all over North America and have no issue with charging whatever the fuck they want for ""the only service in the area"" The very worst part of all of this is Youtube Adsense is HALF of my income, and it's near fucking impossible to upload a 10 or 15 minute video when your internet takes a shit whenever it wants. OH, and it's impossible to play video games, did I mention it's impossible to play video games? I CAN'T PLAY VIDEO GAMES WITH MY MOTHERFUCKING ONLINE FRIENDS. What's the big holdup with Comcast replacing amplifiers? Why is that such a huge fucking no-no that the company has to give you the run around and try blaming the problem on your hardware constantly? A quick google search confirms there are about a billion other people with this issue. Scumbag Comcast doesn't give a fuck.

PS - WHERE DO I POST THIS TO?

1365327866.0	1bugty	Well, as long as people are confessing to murder this morning on Reddit...	KazamaSmokers	104	16	21	This isn't exactly anything I need to get off my chest, as it doesn't directly involve me... but back in the early 80's, an old war buddy of my Dad's stopped by his office and said he had something he needed to talk about. He told my father that the previous week he'd worked late into the night in downtown Hartford and was in the process of putting his briefcase in his car's trunk when a kid came up behind him, stuck a knife against his ribs and demanded his wallet. My father's friend grabbed the tire iron, whirled around and whacked the kid on the side of the head. The kid made a strange sound and ran off. The next morning the top story in the news was a 16-year-old found dead from blunt force trauma about two blocks away. The guy was sure it was the same kid. He asked my father what to do. My father told the guy he was an innocent victim of circumstances and if he went to the cops he just might end up putting his family through a murder trial and destroying his future ability to provide for them. End of story. The case remains unsolved. Just another dead kid in Hartford. My father died a few years later.  I don't know the man's name, but I know where he worked. The guy has long since passed away for all I know. I think I am the only one with this information. It is strange having clues to a (murder? manslaughter?) that you pretty much know nothing about. 	t5_2qjbr	True

1352874565.0	1364me	What a bunch of whiny f'king crybabies we have in this country	MattProducer	158	71	70	"I'm sorry, but I need to rant for a minute.  In 1776, the United States of America formed an independent country, apart from it's homeland of England.  We set up a quasi-democratic system wherein the people vote for their leaders.  With a few exceptions, the winners of the popular vote have become the leaders of the country.

In the 2000 presidential election, George W Bush ran against Al Gore.  I voted for Gore.  In 2004, Bush ran against Kerry.  Again, I voted against Bush and went for Kerry.  Neither time did I think ""Hey, my guy lost.  I don't like the guy who won.  Well, guess I better petition for *MY STATE TO LEAVE THE FUCKING UNION*.""  

Seriously America?  Fucking seriously?  First of all, Obama's only in office for another 4 years.  If you don't like it, at least it's not forever.  Secondly, you lost.  Take after the 8 year old little league kids who lose - you suck it up, get a soda and a slice of pizza, and get the fuck over it.  Lastly, welcome to fucking America.  Where the majority wins.  Just because you're in the minority doesn't mean you need to run away crying.  What you need to do, if you're that opposed to the other side winning, is make sure your team gets the popular (and electoral) vote next time.  And, if he/she doesn't win, then the *majority* of the country obviously doesn't like your team's platform.  Just because the Giants beat the Pats in the Superbowl in 2012 doesn't mean that the Pats and their fans are leaving the NFL and going to the Canadian Football League.  What are they gonna do?  They're gonna work harder and try to win next time.

Jesus fucking Christ.  I am so angry at the so-called ""patriots"" who think America is a sham when their candidate or idea loses.  Get the fuck over it.

Oh, and one more point, while on the topic of Jesus - for the people who ""prayed"" for the right candidate to win, and now you're mad b\c Obama won, too fucking bad.  If your god is real (who\whatever you pray to), and you believe that he actually listens to prayer and does what is asked of him, then obviously he put the right person in office - even if that person isn't the one you had in mind.  Obviously, your idea of the ""right"" candidate isn't your god's idea of the right candidate, which means (if you're a faithful, religious person) that you were wrong, not your god.  Like the people I've dubbed the ""New Confederates,"" **get the fuck over it**."	t5_2qjbr	True

Anyway, five years ago I invented a hanging file system that collapses to fit under the bed. I patented it and somehow managed to get in at a major national retailer (let's just say they have a lot of B's in their name). Unfortunately, I didn't have the money to mass produce it when they placed an order. So my last resort was to submit it to one of those invention TV shows on basic cable and hope they manufacture it for me.

Here's the link to check out my product and vote for it (register with a fake name and your spam email if you prefer): **[Link to product on quirky.com](http://www.quirky.com/ideations/157085)**.

Some pictures of my invention:

[**[http://i.imgur.com/rXA7y.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/rXA7y.jpg)**] 
[**[http://i.imgur.com/dP8hv.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/dP8hv.jpg)**] 
[**[http://i.imgur.com/UzlPh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UzlPh.jpg)**]

Anyway, I know this would have been good for /r/reddit.com, but I'm hoping /r/misc will come through for me. This isn't a plea to pay my medical bills or to make some poor kid's Christmas by sending presents. It's just for a minute or two of your time. But it would still mean a lot to me if they pick up my invention, as this is my lifelong dream and I've gotten so close. I've seen what reddit can do, so if there's any online community that can pull this off, it's you guys.

If you're STILL reading, thank you. And if you checked out my product and voted for it...Thank You! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!

EDIT: Thanks for the upvotes and the actual votes (I got almost 10 votes from reddit in the last hour..You guys rock!), this is why reddit rocks."	t5_2qjbr	True

this was the *exact* M.O. from the movie Rampage. Why is everyone so focused on Batman movies and villains when this movie was probably an instruction manual for the shooter?

-
Dear Friend,
 
Thank you for contacting PETA. We appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns.
 
PETA is on the front lines in the battle to help unwanted dogs and cats. Our caseworkers work tirelessly to rescue homeless animals from environmental dangers and situations of cruelty and neglect (http://www.PETA.org/about/learn-about-peta/community-animal-project.aspx). Our staff members crawl through sewers, poke around junkyards, climb trees, and dodge traffic in order to reach animals in danger. During floods and storms, we are out saving animals’ lives at all hours.
 
PETA does not run a traditional adoption facility; we are a shelter of last resort. While a few of the animals we take in are lost companion animals whom we eventually reunite with their grateful guardians and others are taken to local open-admission agencies where they will have a chance to be adopted, the vast majority of the animals we accept are taken in specifically for euthanasia.
 
Because most people take healthy, adoptable animals directly to local animal shelters, the majority of animals who come to PETA are extremely sick or seriously injured. For these animals, euthanasia is, without a doubt, the most humane option. PETA provides free euthanasia services for people who have very sick, critically injured, or geriatric companions but can’t afford to take them to a veterinarian. One family—lacking money for vet care and transportation—turned to us for help for their cat, who had barely crawled back home after being mauled by a pack of dogs. We were able to give the cat a peaceful end to her intense pain. On another occasion, when an explosion from a power-line transformer burned a flock of starlings, PETA was the only agency to come to the birds’ aid. If our trained technicians had not been ready to end these starlings’ misery, the injured birds would have suffered for days before finally succumbing to a painful death.
 
PETA also began offering our services to pounds in North Carolina in 2000 after we were contacted by a police officer who was distressed by conditions at a county pound. When PETA steps in to properly euthanize animals—at no cost to participating animal shelters—our involvement prevents animals from being shot to death with a .22 caliber firearm, gassed to death in a rusty metal box, or injected with a paralyzing agent that causes slow suffocation without loss of consciousness. Compassionate euthanasia prevents animals from suffering for weeks on end because of disease, illness, or worse. We know from bitter experience that for homeless animals—even those in some animal shelters—there is such a thing as a fate worse than death.
 
Some well-intentioned people might argue that the solution to the overflow of unwanted animals is to open sanctuaries. But the sad reality is that the math just doesn’t add up. There is not enough money available to us or to anyone to build enough sanctuaries or organize enough animal-adoption programs to keep up with the number of unwanted animals—particularly those animals deemed “undesirable” because of their infirmities, age, or behavior. Abandoning domesticated animals to fend for themselves would be irresponsible, of course, but keeping them in cages or pens for a lifetime is no more humane for homeless dogs and cats than it is for animals in laboratories or circuses. To learn more about “no-kill” shelters, please see http://www.PETA.org/features/turned-away-a-closer-look-at-no-kill.aspx, http://www.PETA.org/about/why-peta/no-kill-shelters.aspx and http://features.PETA.org/AllCreaturesGreatAndSmall/ .
 
Putting all our resources into kenneling unwanted animals would also do nothing to stop the flow of more and more homeless dogs and cats. Preventing the source of the problem—the birth of unwanted animals—is where money and efforts need to go. PETA runs three mobile spay-and-neuter clinics in Virginia and North Carolina at least six days a week. The clinics conduct much of their work in disadvantaged neighborhoods, where we offer no-cost to low-cost sterilization surgeries and other services such as flea and tick treatments, vaccinations, and deworming. We sterilize thousands of dogs and cats each year, including feral animals. Since starting our first mobile clinic in 2001, we have sterilized more than 90,000 animals, including more than 9,200 in the 2012 fiscal year alone.
 
We hope you understand that it is heart-wrenching for those of us at PETA and at animal shelters across the country who care deeply for animals to have to hold these animals in our arms and take their lives because there is nowhere for them to go. Those who truly seek to make a difference for animals understand that it is necessary to do the right thing—even when it’s unpleasant—rather than supporting false “solutions” simply because they make us feel less uncomfortable. PETA has always spoken openly about euthanasia on our website and in our publications, and—although we understand that it is upsetting to think about—euthanasia will continue to be necessary in this imperfect world until people take action though spaying and neutering to prevent dogs and cats from bringing new litters into the world. For more thoughts on PETA and euthanasia, please go to http://www.PETA.org/b/thepetafiles/archive/2009/03/30/why-we-euthanize.aspx and http://www.PETA.org/b/thepetafiles/archive/2009/05/14/why-must-we-euthanize-part-ii.aspx.
 
We hope that this message has shed some light on our work. To read more about PETA’s lifesaving work, please visit http://features.PETA.org/petasaves/ .

Thanks again for writing and for sharing your compassion for animals.
 
Sincerely,

P.S. A lot of the misleading and outright false rumors that are spread concerning our efforts are the work of the deceitfully named Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF), a front group for Philip Morris, Outback Steakhouse, KFC, cattle ranchers, and other animal exploiters who kill millions of animals every year—not out of compassion but out of greed.

We got a call from someone saying ""Hello, we're coming over with some gifts for you, we just need to know how to get to your house.""  They were almost there, as they had our address, but we explained how to find our house (it's kind of out of the way).

They showed up about 5 minutes later, and told us they had gotten our names from somewhere as a ""family in need"" and brought us about 9 shopping bags full of groceries, including a full christmas dinner. We were in shock, it couldn't have come at a better time as we had barely enough money to buy ourselves food to get by on, let alone a freaking Christmas Dinner.

They said they were doing this 32 times today with other families.  We didn't know what to say, my friend's mom (homeowner) was almost in tears.  So now we have plenty of food, plenty of things to drink, etc, and it will make our Christmas that much better.

It was the Elks Lodge that did it.. and I tried to figure out how much they were spending to do this 32 times a day. We figured about $120/house * 32 houses, that's almost $4000 they're spending each day they do this! Holy crap.

Anyways, I just wanted to share this story, and give my heartfelt thanks to the Elks Lodge that did it for us; we will be having a real christmas dinner for the first time in years."	t5_2qjbr	True

A place to watch and post videos of humans interacting with wild animals in an interesting, educational, stupid, funny, or dangerous way. 

I mainly created it because the type of videos i find most interesting are the videos of a human having an intense (usually unintentional) situation with a dangerous wild animal. A good example of that would be [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixyA49jX_XI) [2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V1J2Jyk3Uw) [3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_-9t5lXXSU) [4](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqVE9qfg7yI). Number 4 is my favorite and the best example of what i mean.


The subreddit isn't specifically for that, there are all types of human/animal interaction videos posted there. They are all posted by me, so if you enjoy these types of videos as much as i do, and wish to see a decent sized subreddit featuring those videos, give it a visit and contribute!

1321780484.0	miwg9	I just want to tell you guys something.	F4ust	81	22	11	"Hey reddit.  I feel like you all might have mixed feelings about this post, but I feel that I need to say it.  I've been a long time lurker.  Sometimes I post links to music I make.  Sometimes I comment.  Never anything big.  Anyway you look at it, I'm just an average redditor.  All I want to do in this post is say a few things.

First off: tonight was a horrible night for me.  Truly horrible.  I won't go into details; no one really wants to read a sob story.  

That being said and established, I think I've given enough perspective to be able to say what I came here to say.

You all are the most wonderful, brilliant, and compassionate people I have ever had the chance to interact with.  Now, while that may seem hyperbolic, I stand by it.  We're members of a community that has done nothing but contribute to the betterment of the lives of others.  

I get that I might sound overzealous.  There are those of us who are pessimists.  There are those who say and do hurtful things.  We all know that.

But if one were to look at the grand scheme of what we have here, one will see only good.  We are a community that relishes intellect; a community that enjoys the stories and successes of others.  We're a community that flourishes on subjects that only serve to better our everyday lives.  

Again, I had a shitty night tonight.  It really was a bummer.  But I decided to browse for a bit before I fell asleep, and while lost in a sea of rage comics and funny pictures, I noticed that I felt a bit better.  

And then I decided to write this.

I get that it won't make it to the front page.  I get that probably only a few of you will see it, and even fewer will take the time to read it all.  But if you have made it this far into my wall of text, I hope that it brightens your day (or night) just a little.  It's the best I can do right now.  

Anyway, I love all of you, and I'm honored to be considered a member of reddit.

-F4ust

http://media.daum.net/society/newsview?newsid=20130602205106725

(this news reminds me of chinese words 以夷制夷 (yǐ yí zhì yí)
to use foreigners to subdue foreigners (idiom); let the barbarians fight it out among themselves (traditional policy of successive dynasties)
To use western science and technology to counter imperialist encroachment (late Qing modernizing slogan). but i think it must not happen in present society but it looks like the society is fucked up).

Parents in south korea hired very scary gangs to solve school bullying problem.
they look very scary with big tattoos. they act like uncle for the victim student. they spread rumor that his uncle is gang member. there are many enterprises on this nowadays. if those teenages are not students, they use violent way. they even hit or bully them.
there were 40 cases for 2~3 years. they didn't fail even a time.
you must pay 5,000,000 won if it takes a month. 2 weeks for 1,500,000~1,800,000 won.

I am completing a PhD in Psychology looking at the factors that relate to self-perceived sexual attractiveness. 

I am looking for men and women over the age of 18 to complete an anonymous online questionnaire. The questionnaire will take approximately 30 minutes to complete and may be carried out in your own time and in your own environment. 

I imagine the results from my study will be interesting to most of you and as a thank you I will post a document detailing my results (when I have them) to Reddit.

I hope you enjoy the study and maybe learn a little about yourself through completing it!

4. Use your robot. If it ever goes rogue, and starts to disobey humans, it will switch to the red, seeing that it is more efficient.

5. When you see the red eyes, you know it's time to take it in for maintenance and reprogramming before its rogue AI spreads.

1362441764.0	19o6td	(X-post from /r/self) Hey Reddit! Have you heard of Harper High School in Chicago?	callmecurly	68	19	8	"Harper High School was featured on This American Life a couple weeks ago in two episodes, that you can listen to [here](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/487/harper-high-school-part-one) and [here](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/488/harper-high-school-part-two).

 Basically, this school is a safe haven for students who live in one of the most violent areas of Chicago, and they're about to lose 2 million dollars of their funding this next year, despite being extremely successful. 

They've set up a donation page [here](https://www.wepay.com/donations/american-life--harper-high-school--donations) to bridge the gap in funding. I think it would be amazing for reddit to mobilize around this just like when they raised money for Donor's Choose, and save this school from being rendered unable to help its students.

Sorry if this sub isn't the right place to put this, I just want to get this as visible as possible! Just to be clear I am in no way affiliated with Harper High School or This American Life, I just found this story inspiring and wanted to share. "	t5_2qjbr	True

I don't consider it an addiction, nor do I think it's really that harmful, because IIRC paper's mostly made of wood pulp and cotton, both of which aren't exactly toxic or inedible. It's just becoming annoying that a lot of my friends and family keep telling me to stop. Also, a lot of my documents and writing paper is missing significant chunks, which can get frustrating, because I often don't really remember eating them.
