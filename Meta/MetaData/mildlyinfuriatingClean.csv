I believe we are at the point now where we expect April Fools bullshit to pop up on Reddit and other places around the web and it gets to the point where the stuff people actually care about and want to know gets filtered out by some obvious crap like a Minecraft 2.0 release. It's not funny anymore, it's just expected and boring, and the same old crap that has such a niche sense of humour that not only the people you pulled the prank on hate you, but the internet does aswell because you karma whored the shit out of a post with a misleading title to lead someone to a page with a gif of a buffering youtube video. Seriously? Is this what life has come to on the internet?
