1358814051.0	170tgh	One of my favorite puzzles from the MIT Mystery Hunt: Time Conundrum. WARNING: This puzzle is LONG.	zachbarnett	42	2	31	"A little bit of background. There is a certain type of puzzle that is fairly unique to the MIT Mystery Hunt. They are called ""Duck-Conundrum"" puzzles.

Certain people complained that the MIT Mystery Hunt puzzles were too hard because most of them had absolutely no instructions. In response, a few puzzle-makers crafted some puzzles that were absolutely nothing BUT instructions. However, these resulting duck conundrums are among the hardest that the Hunt has to offer.

What I believe to be the first Duck Conundrum is available [here](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/00/set5/6/Puzzle.html). 

Now, let's get to this year's Duck Conundrum. 

---------

**TIME CONUNDRUM**

RULES:

You are about to embark upon a Conundrum. Unlike other puzzles, the instructions for this puzzle are clear and explicit; simply follow the instructions exactly as they are written, and the answer will be spelled out for you. All you need to do is, at each time step, look at what is written on your instructions for that time step, and carry out the instructions. You always carry out one numbered instruction per time step.

Note that you follow the instructions as they are written when you get to them; if instruction 5 says to cross off instruction 4, then you will still do instruction 4 when time step 4 comes along.

Unlike other Conundrums, this is a Time Conundrum. You may encounter time travel, closed timelike curves, and, if you do things wrong, inconsistencies and grandfather paradoxes. Your goal is to make it through with a single consistent history.

(1) Timesteps

During each time step, two things happen, in this order:

* You take the action listed on your instructions under the number of the timestep.
* Any items present act. Items only take actions if you have instructed them to do so, or if they are a DUCK or a ROBOT (see below). If there are multiple items taking actions, the ones that press Big Red Buttons act before any others. Multiple items pressing the Big Red Button act simultaneously, all pushing the button together.
After the timestep is complete, but before the next timestep, any items arriving from distant points in time appear in the center of the room.

(2) Items

You will encounter various items:

* The name of an item is exactly the string that appears in ALL CAPS whenever the item is mentioned.
* You are not an item.
* An item is ""present"" if it is in the room, including in the TIME MACHINE.
* Items will never be brought into or removed from the room without cause. You are not a wizard who can spontaneously create things. Of course, items might appear or disappear due to time travel, but this will only happen if legitimately caused by the TIME MACHINE according to its rules.
* An item's age is defined as the number of timesteps since it entered the room as measured by an internal clock on the item. So if it entered the room on timestep 4, then during timestep 7 its age is 3. If during timestep 7 it travels back in time by 6 timesteps, arriving after timestep 1, then on timestep 2 its age is 4. ""Younger"" and ""Older"" refer to comparisons of this age.
* If there are several copies of the same item present and the instructions do not specify a particular one (e.g. they say ""the BANANA""), they mean the oldest one.
* If the instructions refer to ""The BANANA,"" that means that there is at least one BANANA present.
* A ""DUCK"" is an item that occasionally moves on its own. At the end of each positive prime numbered timestep (after you finish whatever you do, but before anything appears from other times), each DUCK will act. If it is not in a TIME MACHINE, it will enter the TIME MACHINE. If it is in a TIME MACHINE, it will press the Big Red Button on the TIME MACHINE it is in.
*A ""ROBOT"" is an item which, whenever it is present on a timestep which ends in a 5 (-15, -5, 5, 15, 25, etc), resets the TIME MACHINE's dial to be equal to the ROBOT's current age.

(3) Wording

* ""A BANANA that is yellow"" means that there is exactly one such banana, or, if there are more than one, it does not matter which is being referred to.
* ""All BANANAs"" means all of the bananas. There could be none.
* An object which ""just arrived"" or ""just appeared"" is one which appeared in the middle of the room after the previous timestep and before the current one.

(4) Other Notes

* You will often be told to use letters and numbers interchangeably. You should always use the conversion A=1, B=2, and so on, unless otherwise specified. You should never have to convert a number that is not between 1 and 26 to a letter.
* If you ever find yourself with several sets of instructions in the room, use the oldest one.
* Time is infinite in the past and future; you simply take no actions before your instructions begin or after they end.

(5) Starting

* You begin on timestep 0 (the time when you unlocked this puzzle). On timestep 0, you enter the room carrying your COMPUTER and these INSTRUCTIONS. As you can see, the INSTRUCTIONS have a space marked ""Answer"" at the top of the section. When told to write in the ""slots,"" write in these blanks. They are numbered from left to right.

* The room is empty except for a single TIME MACHINE, which was brought into the room at some point in the very distant past, long previous to the time of your actions or any effects of your actions (this act of bringing the TIME MACHINE in is the only exception to rule 2.4).

*Time Machine Manual*

The TIME MACHINE causes time travel. It has two controls:

* A dial, which can be set to any integer. This represents the distance forward or backward that objects in the time machine will be sent.
* A Big Red Button. When pressed, any items inside the TIME MACHINE are transported to a different point in time, indicated by the dial. So if you press the Big Red Button on timestep 17 and the dial says +3, the items appear on timestep 20.
* The items appear in the center of the room (not in the TIME MACHINE), immediately after the timestep indicated.
* The TIME MACHINE does not move itself, only its contents.

**Warmups**

If you've already started the puzzle, you'd better not waste time on these warmups or else all the precise timing will be broken - you have to keep doing exactly one instruction per timestep!

But if you have some time before you start, it might be worth running through these smaller sets of instructions first, to get a feel for how the TIME MACHINE works. Figure out how to follow the instructions without leading to a contradiction.

**Warmup A**

0: Begin with an empty room except for a TIME MACHINE with dial set to 0.

1. Get a DUCK and put it in the room.
1. Add 1 to the TIME MACHINE's dial.
1. There is now a DUCK in the TIME MACHINE.
1. There are no DUCKs in the room.
1. There is a DUCK in the center of the room.

**Warmup B**

0: Begin with an empty room except for a TIME MACHINE with dial set to 0.

1. Subtract 1 from the TIME MACHINE's dial.
1. Subtract 2 from the TIME MACHINE's dial.
1. The TIME MACHINE is not empty.

Below is the real Time Conundrum Puzzle.

--------------------------

Answer: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

**Instructions**

1. Hurray! Read the answer from the new INSTRUCTIONS that just appeared. This is the correct answer to the puzzle; go ahead and call it in. You're done!
1. What, you're still working? Ok, then. First of all, the new set of INSTRUCTIONS is necessarily older than the one you brought with you, so make sure to use it instead, according to rule #4.2. But because it has the right answer already written in and we wouldn't want to write over the correct answer, whenever you're told to write a letter, write it in the ""Answer"" blanks on the original (younger) one. Now, write the appropriate letter in the seventh slot. (Not the correct letter; that would lead to a paradox. Write the unique letter which does not lead to a paradox.)
1. Read the TIME MACHINE's dial, and write it into the first slot of the answer. Then set the TIME MACHINE's dial to the number of items in the room.
1. Read the TIME MACHINE's dial, and write it into the slot where the final answer has an S.
1. The ROBOT that just appeared is going to reset the TIME MACHINE's dial now. Figure out what he will set it to, and write the result in the tenth slot.
1. Ok, enough observing. Time to try it out! Put the ROBOT in the TIME MACHINE and press the Big Red Button.
1. Note that there are more than 4 items present.
1. Count the number of vowels present in the names of all the items. Subtract the sixth letter of the answer, and write the result in the 4th spot.
1. Decrement the time dial by the 4th, 5th, and 7th letters of the answer (one after the other; in other words decrement by their sum).
1. Count the number of Cs present in the names of all the items present. Write the sum of that number and the time dial in the eighth slot.
1. Go buy a CUCUMBER and put it in the TIME MACHINE.
1. Add the square of the 9th letter of the final answer to the time dial.
1. Press the Big Red Button.
1. Append the following instruction to the end of step 22 of the younger INSTRUCTIONS, and to step 29 of the older INSTRUCTIONS: ""Write the sum of the digits in the time dial (ignoring the negative sign) minus the third letter of the answer in the 3rd slot.""
1. Having two sets of INSTRUCTIONS is confusing. Burn one. No, wait! The older one must be the younger one after it traveled back in time, so you'd better make them match. There are currently four handwritten corrections on the older one, two of which you need to transfer over to avoid paradoxes. First, caesar shift the ""S"" in step 4 forward by the 7th letter of the answer. Second, cross out step 12 and replace it with ""Increment the time dial by 4, then square it, then decrement it by 1."" Although, looking back on it, notice that the second change didn't actually affect the result of step 12 at all. After making those changes, burn one set of INSTRUCTIONS (the one you can burn without causing a paradox).
1. Write the length of the shortest item name present in the 5th slot.
1. Add 7 to the TIME MACHINE's dial.
1. Having the ROBOT around is probably confusing you. Go to the dump and dispose of it.
1. Eat the CUCUMBER, after writing its age in the 9th slot.
1. Oh, dear, look what you've done. Now you've gotten rid of a ROBOT, but never actually acquired one. To fix it, you'd better go to the store and buy a new ROBOT. Bring it back and put it in the TIME MACHINE, then press the Big Red Button. Note that eating the CUCUMBER was fine, since you already bought the CUCUMBER in step 11.
1. There is in the room a TIME MACHINE with dial not set to -4! Set it to -4, quick!
1. There are two items present with multiple copies of the item (of different ages) present. Put the youngest copy of each in the TIME MACHINE. (One of them might not fit so well, but you should be able to squeeze it in if you pinch the corners down). Press the Big Red Button. Then decrement the TIME MACHINE's dial by the first letter of the final answer. Then increment the TIME MACHINE's dial by the last letter of the final answer. Put the ROBOT in the TIME MACHINE, and press the Big Red Button. Kill all the DUCKs in the room.
1. Decrement the TIME MACHINE's dial by the eighth letter of the answer.
1. The object present with the shortest name has never been created nor destroyed; it is in a perpetual time loop. Figure out the period of the time loop (using the normal age rules #2.5). Note that this length is equal to the sum of the second and third letters of the answer.
1. Figure out the COMPUTER's age. Add one, divide by 3, and add one, then write the result in the 6th slot.
1. Remove the DUCK from the TIME MACHINE.
1. You now have something written in the answer space! It's not the answer of course - you already know the answer, and have since step one. Why are you still working, again? Well, anyway, you have a thing written in the answer slot; maybe you should call it in even though it's wrong?
1. No, wait, don't call it in yet! Take the COMPUTER (not a COMPUTER being held by another character), open a web browser, and navigate to the puzzle page for this puzzle. Type the phrase written in the answer space into the ""Call In Answer"" box, but don't click submit. Relieve the MONKEY of his current possession, and hand him the COMPUTER you typed into. Put him in the TIME MACHINE.
1. Instruct the MONKEY that on the next timestep he experiences, he should press the ""Submit"" button on the COMPUTER. Then he should wait until timestep -2, at which point he should get in the TIME MACHINE (still carrying the item he brought with him) and press the Big Red Button. After ensuring that he understands his instructions, press the Big Red Button.
1. Increment the TIME MACHINE's dial by 3 less than the 5th letter of the final answer.
1. All right, seriously, enough dorking around with time machines ... much more of this will probably disrupt some spacetime continuum or something. Erase the nonsense thing in the answer space at the top of these INSTRUCTIONS, and write the actual final answer. Xerox these INSTRUCTIONS, and put the original into the TIME MACHINE.
1. Press the Big Red Button. Set the TIME MACHINE's dial to negative the first letter of the final answer, as a hint to anyone who comes in after you. Take one last look around - the room should be empty except for the TIME MACHINE, your COMPUTER, and a set of INSTRUCTIONS. Take the COMPUTER and INSTRUCTIONS with you (but leave the TIME MACHINE). Leave this strange, strange room, and go back to the rest of the Hunt.

EDIT: One other piece of information that you need. Before this puzzle became available to your team, you received a call from HQ telling you that your answer of ""Red Herring"" is incorrect. But since no one called in ""Red Herring"" as an answer, it's not clear why they would call you to tell you this. But maybe you can figure it out by solving the puzzle.

1357412963.0	160okd	A Harder Prisoner Puzzle	zachbarnett	32	5	53	"This is a revised version of a [prisoner puzzle I posted a few days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/puzzles/comments/15xe3e/a_prisoner_puzzle_from_car_talk/).

23 prisoners go to jail. They are immediately sent to isolated cells and have no communication with one another.

The Warden makes his way from cell to cell, and tells each prisoner the following information:

&gt;In the prison is a switch room, which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the on or the off position. I am not telling you their present positions. The switches are not connected to anything.

&gt;After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner may select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He may elect not to do anything if he wishes. Then he'll be led back to his cell.

&gt;No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be given the same instructions. Since I'm going to choose prisoners at random, I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back. Eventually, everyone will have visited the switch room about as many times as everyone else. 

&gt;At any time anyone of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'

&gt;If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators.""

You learn of the plight of these prisoners and want to try to help them. You have one chance: You can write up a letter with a strategy, and distribute it to all of the prisoners. **You cannot give different letters to different prisoners; they all must receive the same document.**

What do you tell them to do?

EDIT: For the record, I don't have the solution yet, but I think I'm close. I'm on IRC (#boardgames on irc.freenode.net) if anyone wants to collaborate with me.

EDIT 2: I recommend trying to solve the puzzle for smaller numbers of prisoners. I have it solved for 5 prisoners right now.

EDIT 3: This remains unsolved as far as I know.

EDIT 4: Since this remains unsolved, I'm going to post my progress here. Below is the solution of this puzzle involving *five* prisoners, instead of 23:

    The room has four states: 00, 01, 10, 11. Consider the infinite sequence of states: 
    00 → 01 → 11 → 10 → 00 → ...

    The first time you enter the room, take the room to the next state in the sequence. 
    From that point forward, your only job is to do that exact same move, whenever it is possible.

    So if you first encounter the room in 00, then your only job is to go from 00 to 01, 
    whenever you can. Pass otherwise.

    This procedure will assign every prisoner to a ""job,"" and exactly two of you will 
    end up with the same job. You should make the declaration to the Warden after 
    you notice that someone else has done your job for you.

EDIT 5: This problem is now solved. angelatheist was the first to solve it, and Lixen may have improved upon angelatheist's solution.

Towards the end he mentions regular expressions could further reduce the possible answer list more than just letter counts.  I also read an article that stated that the word ‘jazz’ was the [hardest word to guess](http://www.neatorama.com/2010/08/17/jazz-is-the-hardest-word-to-guess-in-hangma).

Since I just built a regular expression tool that references a 120,000 word list with some other scripting functionality, I thought it would be fun way to debug it. 

So after running it for around a half hour, it spit out a list of words that confirmed that ‘jazz’ was the hardest.  The algorithm was pretty simple.  In a loop, it would run the regular expression and then find the letter found in the most words.  Using the word ‘aero’ as an example:

Edit: Reddit replaced the caret with superscript.  Assume the list was prefiltered by length and the RegEx start and end of word token can be removed.

* RegEx:     ....
* Most common letter in 3861words:     A
* Correct. Find letter and replace in RegEx.
* RegEx:     a...
* Most common letter in 193 words:    S
* Miss.  Update RegEx.
* RegEx:     a[!s][!s][!s]
* Most common letter in 132 words:    E
* Correct. Find letter and replace in RegEx.
* RegEx:     ae[!s][!s]
* Most common letter in 111 words:    O
* Correct. Find letter and replace in RegEx.
* RegEx:     ae[!s]o
* Most common letter in 1 word:    R
* Correct.  Answer is ‘aero’

Here are the top 10 hardest words to guess using this algorithm:

* jazz	21
* jeu	21
* jeux	20
* zill	19
* zax	19
* jazzy	19
* zinc	19
* queue	19
* pazazz	19
* zills	18

But [any regular expression guru](http://xkcd.com/208/) can see that there is a better expression that can be written.  When the second list was generated, it contained words like ‘alfa’, and ‘aqua’.  These words match the pattern, but an additional piece of information was gathered when the placement of the letter was revealed.  Namely, ONLY the first letter was an A. 

Using this new information, I updated the script and here is how the word ‘aero’ was guessed:

* RegEx:     ....
* Most common letter in 3861words:     A
* Correct. Find letter and replace in RegEx.
* RegEx:     a[!a][!a][!a]
* Most common letter in 152 words:    E
* Correct. Find letter and replace in RegEx.
* RegEx:     ae[!ae][!ae]
* Most common letter in 3 words:    O
* Correct. Find letter and replace in RegEx.
* RegEx:     ae[!aeo]o
* Most common letter in 1 word:    R
* Correct.  Answer is ‘aero’

And here are the top 10 hardest words to guess using this algorithm:

* zill	19
* zills	18
* yill	18
* yills	17
* will	17
* yin	17
* wills	16
* vill	16
* yins	16
* yuck	16

So the new winner is ‘zill’ (I put the word ‘will’ in the title because it’s the first common word that shows up).  ‘jazz’ can be found in 14 guesses.

Also, to eliminate guessing a correct letter in the case of a tie, I purposely guess the letter that isn’t in the answer.  This makes a big difference in the 3 and 4 letter words especially.  This ensures that the number of guesses is the maximum number possible.

So there you have it, a new hardest hangman word: ‘will’!

1371407717.0	1ggt26	Everything equals 6	ilogik	31	4	49	"this is from a recent episode of Scam School, but I don't remember seeing it here:

&gt;0  0  0  =  6

&gt;1  1  1  =  6

&gt;2  2  2  =  6

&gt;3  3  3  =  6

&gt;4  4  4  =  6

&gt;5  5  5  =  6

&gt;6  6  6  =  6

&gt;7  7  7  =  6

&gt;8  8  8  =  6

&gt;9  9  9  =  6

the puzzle is to make the above statements true by adding only mathematical operations, but no digits.

for example, the simplest one is: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6

but you can't do: 0 + 0 + 0 + 6 = 6 since that would include a digit. also you can't touch the equal sign (for example turning it into &lt;= )

you can use a square root, but you can't raise to a power since you would need a number for that...

there are multiple solutions.

I do have a small tip on the order you should do them in, but I'm putting it in a spoiler tag in case you want to find out by yourself:
[0 and 1 are a bit more difficult, I wouldn't start with them. I'd also suggest doing number 8 last](/sp)

The river is infinite and straight. The boat is at a station on the river when you start bombing. It has a constant velocity, and each day it moves from one station to another, docking at midnight. The stations are placed at regular intervals, so the boat goes past the same number of stations every day, always in the same direction. You may only bomb once every 24 hours, and only on midnight.

You can see the official site [here](http://www.oldsantafetradingco.com/the-thrill-resource-page) or the Today show story [here](http://www.today.com/news/want-find-his-hidden-treasure-worth-millions-head-outdoors-1C8576285).  

Here's the poem:


As I have gone alone in there  
And with my treasures bold,  
I can keep my secret where,  
And hint of riches new and old.  

Begin it where warm waters halt  
And take it in the canyon down,  
Not far, but too far to walk.  
Put in below the home of Brown.  

From there it’s no place for the meek,  
The end is drawing ever nigh;  
There’ll be no paddle up your creek,  
Just heavy loads and water high.

If you’ve been wise and found the blaze,  
Look quickly down, your quest to cease  
But tarry scant with marvel gaze,  
Just take the chest and go in peace.

So why is it that I must go  
And leave my trove for all to seek?  
The answers I already know  
I’ve done it tired, and now I’m weak

So hear me all and listen good,  
Your effort will be worth the cold.  
If you are brave and in the wood  
I give you title to the gold.



And the 3 additional clues:

Clue #10:  
The treasure is hidden higher than 5,000 feet above sea level.

Clue #11:  
No need to dig up the old outhouses, the treasure is not associated with any structure.

Clue #12:  
The treasure is not in a graveyard

The question so happens to be heard by a passing stranger, who shows them a large leather sack: ""Inside this sack are contained *five* hats, two of them white, three of them (the rest) black. Now close your eyes."" With that the stranger puts a *black hat on each old man*. ""Open your eyes,"" he says. ""The first one to find out the color of his hat, without taking it off, is the wisest one."" 

With that he leaves, taking the leather sack that contains the two white hats with him. The three wise men look at each-other; *each one can see the color of the other two's hats but not their own*. After several minutes of silence one of the wise men exclaims: ""I'm wearing a black hat!"" 

How did he find that out?


(It should be noted that there's no trickery involved with coming to the answer, it's almost pure logic. With that said, good luck!)


Edit: Most of you have figured out the solution so to anyone who doesn't understand, here it is written is simple words:

[The dude who was correct about wearing a black hat (we'll call him A) was absolutely sure he wasn't wearing white one, so A must have imagined a scenario where he *was* wearing a white hat. He imagined what B (the other dude) was thinking if he saw a white hat and a black hat in front of him, this is what B was thinking: ""I see a white and black hat in front of me. If I was wearing a white hat, then C would see two white hats in front of him and immediately know he was wearing a black hat... but since he hasn't said anything yet, I must be wearing a black hat."" Now A knows that he's wearing a black hat, since B hasn't said anything.](/sp)"	t5_2qh99	True

The goblin cant swim, never sleeps or eats, has perfect eyesight and is perfectly logical - meaning you cant outsmart if there would be a way for him to stop it.

Goblin obviously wants you dead therefore when you reach the shore and theres a goblin waiting for you...your gonna have a bad time.
But if you manage to get to the shore without goblin standing and waiting for you, you can surely outrun him.

The problem is that the goblin is exactly 4 times as fast on dry land as you are rowing your boat.

 Consider a standard chessboard with 64 squares. The Devil is in the room with you. He places one coin on each of the 64 squares, randomly facing heads or tails up. He arbitrarily selects a square on the board, which he calls the Magic Square. Then you have to flip a coin of your choosing, from heads to tails or vice versa. Now, a friend of yours enters the room. Just by looking at the coins, he must tell the Devil the location of the Magic Square. You may discuss any strategy/algorithm with your friend beforehand. What strategy do you use to do this?
Note: this problem is truly gratifying to solve on your own, and fortunately does not have any discussion threads anywhere. If you have figured out the solution, please do not post it in the comments, even with a spoiler. Like I said, I want people to solve it without the temptation of a convenient solution over them."	t5_2qh99	True

#   #   #   #   #

The three wisest sages in the land were brought before the king to see which of them were worthy to become the king's advisor. After passing many tests of cunning and invention, they were pitted against each other in a final battle of the wits.

Led blind-folded into a small room, the sages were seated around a small wooden table as the king described the test for them.

""Upon each of your heads I have placed a hat. Now you are either wearing a blue hat or a white hat. All I will tell you is this- at least one of you is wearing a blue hat. There may be only one blue hat and two white hats, there may be two blue hats and one white hat, or there may be three blue hats. But you may be certain that there are not three white hats.""

""I will shortly remove your blind folds, and the test will begin. The first to correctly announce the color of his hat shall be my advisor. Be warned however, he who guesses wrongly shall be beheaded. If not one of you answers within the hour, you will be sent home and I will seek elsewhere for wisdom.""

With that, the king uncovered the sages' eyes and sat in the corner and waited. One sage looked around and saw that his competitors each were wearing blue hats. From the look in their eyes he could see their thoughts were the same as his, ""What is the color of my hat?""

For what seemed like hours no one spoke. Finally he stood up and said, ""The color of the hat I am wearing is...""

Please do not answer with just the color; Explain *how* you figured out the answer as well. (Otherwise it would just be a 50/50 chance of getting it correct)."	t5_2qh99	True

Bishop Samuel Wilberforce was fond of riddles. After his death in 1873, this one was found among his literary papers:

I’m the sweetest of sounds in Orchestra heard,
Yet in Orchestra never was seen.
I’m a bird of gay plumage, yet less like a bird,
Nothing ever in Nature was seen.
Touch the earth I expire, in water I die,
In air I lose breath, yet can swim and can fly;
Darkness destroys me, and light is my death,
And I only keep going by holding my breath.
If my name can’t be guessed by a boy or a man,
By a woman or girl it certainly can.

This game is played with 6 envelopes.  Here are the dollar values of each envelope.(all in USD)

5   10   20   40   80   160

The basic gist of these envelopes is that the value starts at five and doubles each progressive step upwards.
We both draw a random envelope and are told that our envelopes are adjacent in value (either mine is half yours of double). Then we are given the option to switch.

You happen to have the 20 dollar envelope so switching sounds exciting.  You run a quick calculation in your head and calculate your EV to be (10+40)/2, or 25, which is greater than 20.  So obviously you should switch!

But you are clever.  You think about if I want to switch too.  Assume I have the 10 dollar envelope.  Then my EV is (5+20)/2, which is greater than 10.  So if I had the 10 I would switch.  But what if I have the 40?     Then my EV is (80+20)/2 = 50 &gt;40.  So when I have 40 I would switch too!

Well obviously we both can't gain from switching... somebody has to lose that trade. The prize money doesn't magically multiply by the act of switching. Can you find the flaw in your own reasoning? (:P) Do you want to switch with me?

The problem is that your worker is paranoid.  He has to be paid exactly 1/7 of a gold bar each day every day for all seven days or he will leave.  For example if he has any less than 2/7 on the second day he will think that you will shaft him and leave.  If he has 2/7 on the first day he will take his extra 1/7 that he didn't earn and run away with his small profit.  These rules apply to all the days.

So obviously you realize you must cut the gold bar.  You take the rectangular prism to the blacksmith and tell him to cut it for you.  He asks you how many cuts you need and you, being ever so clever and cheap, say just two.

	A game of assassins is being conducted in the city of Paris in the year 1825. Six expert assassins will compete to kill one another over the course of 5 days until there is only one left standing. When a person is killed, the game is set on hold and no one is allowed to kill until the dawn of the next day (only one person dies per day). The assassins are made up of four men: Danton, Will, John and George, and two women: Selena and Brittany. Each of the six assassins will use one of these weapons of choice for the game: Crossbow, Wire, Knives, Poison, Hammer, or Hands. Each of these assassins also has an alias and a different colored mask that they will use during the game. These consist of: “The Avenger”, “The Stalker”, “The Phantom”, “The Crusader”, “The Spider”, and “The Shadow”. The colors of their masks will consist of: red, black, blue, white, grey and green. One killing will happen at each of these places: Bridge, Market, Alley, Tunnel, and Roof. 
	Using the clues below, identify each assassin’s alias, mask color, weapon of choice, where and on what day they were killed and by whom. The winner of the game is obviously not killed by anyone. Keep in mind that not every assassin necessarily kills anyone and that it is possible for an assassin to kill more than one person. 

Clues:

1.	On the first day, Selena sees the man wearing the red mask kill “The Crusader” under the bridge. The man did not use a crossbow to do so.
2.	On the second day, “The Spider” sees the man wearing the black mask kill a woman with poison.
3.	On the third day, George sees “The Stalker” kill Danton with wire in an alley.
4.	On the fourth day, “The Phantom” sees the assassin wearing the green mask kill the assassin whose weapon of choice was the crossbow and that wore a white mask. 
5.	On the fifth day, Selena kills the man whose weapon of choice were knives in a tunnel and wins the game.
6.	Of the opponents of the assassin who made the most kills, one that they did not kill was the man who wore the blue mask and whose weapon of choice was the hammer. Another was “The Shadow”.
7.	The assassin who killed someone on the roof killed only that person.
8.	Will was not killed by the weapon of choice of the assassin who killed the assassin whose weapon of choice was poison.

I was watching Bear Grylls in ""Worst Case Scenarios"" a month ago.  In the episode, he details what to do if your car breaks down in the middle of the desert.
 
I'll set the scene:

* you are wearing your white-collar business attire and going for a job interview in the middle of nowhere.

* your jeep's engine overheats and starts to break down.  You pull over and notice your mobile phone has died.

* standard desert temperature scenario - extremely hot at night and freezing at night.
 
1.  You want to stop the engine from overheating.  Do you:
a) turn off the air conditioner and turn on the heater,
b) release the radiator pressure cap, or
c) pour water over the engine?
 
2.  Your engine no longer works and you need to find a viable water source.  You take your car's licence plate and walk 30 metres away from the road.  You dig deep and extract large lumps of damp sand.  Using what's around you, how do you extract and drink water from the sand? 
 
3.  The temperature is falling below zero, and you need to start a fire.  You have no matches and the car's cigarette lighter doesn't work.  What can you use?
 
4.  The next morning you spot dirt-bikers riding through the desert.  You can't seem to get their attention using a mirror and you want to burn something in the fire to get their attention.  What should you burn?

All 17 cannibals are equally strong, (so that no one can overpower another and eat him/her), perfectly logical (if anything can be deduced logically they will immediately do it) and completely independent of each other ( no allegiances/ any kind of special bonds).

One day a traveler stumbles upon the cannibal island. He is weaker than the cannibals and therefore a cannibal can overpower him and eat him.  But in eating such a large meal, the cannibal would thus weaken himself so that another cannibal could overpower him and eat him. By eating a weakened cannibal a cannibal becomes weak himself and vulnerable.

The cannibals first objective is to live.  His very second is to eat.  He will eat another cannibal/ the traveler in any case that doesn't end in his death.

Please remember that spoiler tags are in effect now! Don't forget to use them when appropriate!

This is a two minute mystery from a book called ""The Little Book of Bathroom Crime Puzzles"" by M. Diane Vogt

Edna Mae Wittkop had lived in Michigan's frigidly cold Upper Peninsula all seven decades of her life, so she had learned to appreciate good neighbours. Her neighbour, Harry Timmons, had plowed the heavy snow from her driveway early this morning while she'd baked him a pumpkin pie. The pie was still warm when she decided to deliver it.

She slipped her feet into a pair of heavy boots and threw on a down jacket, lifting the hood to cover her head. She settler her old glasses on her nose, pushed her hands into her mittens, lifted the pie and waddled out the kitchen door. Edna Mae made her way carefully down the freshly shoveled driveway and across the street.

Breathing raggedly, she rang Harry's doorbell. 'Well I can't leave the pie outside' she said aloud. She struggled with her mittens, but managed to turn the know and push the door open. 'Yoo hoo! Harry! Are you here?' she called, huffing from exertion. She entered and stopped cold in her tracks.

A man knelt down next to Harry's still body. He looked up, stared at her for several seconds and then bolted out the kitchen door.

When the ambulance and the sheriff finally arrived at the scene, Edna Mae told them all she knew. 'Harry Timmons was attacked' she explained, her voice unsteady.

**When the sheriff pressed further, Edna Mae couldn't give him a good description of Harry's attacker. Why not?**

The friend thought carefully for awhile and then said:

- I can not answer yet because I am still missing one more clue.

The other friend then said:

- Yes, you are right. I forgot to tell you my oldest daughter wears glasses...

1351836822.0	12i4kx	High Number Dice Game	dasbro	13	3	1	"Instead of slowly moving out of the recession that started 4 years ago we actually slid into the worst depression in history. Like most people you spend your days at the local bar, wallowing in your sorrows. Everyone is desperate, and so they gamble with the little money they have. One day you decide you're smart enough to invent a game where the odds are in your favor, and yet people are still willing to play.

You have 3 blank six sided die. On each of the sides you can write any number you want. With these 3 die you create a game. You offer any of the three die to your opponent and he picks one, and then you pick one. Each person bets an equal amount, and then whoever rolls the highest number wins.

You go back to the bar, play this game with everyone there, and proceed to win tons of money. After a while your family is well off and you survive the depression, unlike most.

What strategy did you use when writing the numbers on these die. You must be able to win more than 50% of the time, no matter what die your opponent chooses.

TLDR: You have 3 blank six sided die; A, B, and C. On each side you can write any number you want. Make it so that A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A, greater than 50% of the time. It's like rock paper scissors for dice."	t5_2qh99	True

1. bobbysue22
2. Harke
3. akatookey
4. Ejvind
5. eyeyen

Thanks to all who participated!


**EDIT #3 (10/8/12 4:30PM ET): Didn't think anyone would be still be going at it! Again, apologies for anyone who spent waaay too much time on this!  I'd rather not just post the solution, so I'll just keep on adding clues. There are several users who have made valiant attempts, but so far no winners. (Thank you to those who have tried and are still trying!)**

Hints for once you get past the Kansuko puzzle part...

* There is a special subreddit with hidden clues. If you find this subreddit, it should be obvious it's part of the scavenger hunt. 
* There is a special user account that has been leaving comments for over 30 days. These comments are seemingly innocent, but hide an encrypted phrase, 17 letters long.
* The first letter of the encrypted phrase is H.
* The hidden clues on the subreddit tell you the post and particular word to take the first letter from, similar to the Ottendorf cipher used in National Treasure.
* The encrypted phrase will need a keyword to decipher.
* Once decrypted, it asks for a specific person.

I'll give it another day or so before getting REALLY specific.


**EDIT #2: Enter as many times as you'd like. Think of it like the National Treasure movie. There are some seemingly innocent 'posts' or DoGood letters, and a key to tell you which letter each post is important. Find the important posts, find the key, and pull out each letter. I've given you the first letter to confirm if you're on the right path.**

Thanks to all those that have attempted so far, it was meant to be challenging but I hope I didn't ruin your day/night! Looks like I'll need to add more to the prizes to make your effort worth it.


**EDIT #1:  12 hours in and no winners yet. I guess I did make it a little difficult. Some people have gotten pretty far, most seem like they haven't.  Solving the puzzle and checking your work gives you a clue. That should lead you back to Reddit to a particular location. Find the next clue and use it with the completed puzzle to head to the next part of Reddit. There's a special subreddit with hidden clues, but this is only to help you find the encrypted question. In reality, the puzzle/clues span over 17 subreddits in the past 30 days, but you don't need to visit each one!**

A little over a year ago, I came up with a puzzle idea called Kansuko based off of the classic Sudoku with some simple arithmetic. While still just a concept, I put together a crude website and posted it on Reddit for feedback. The folks over at /r/WebGames were gracious enough to play and provide great feedback and opinions!

&gt; [That was brutal. It took me half an hour of absolutely racking my brain to complete a puzzle. I definitely enjoyed that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WebGames/comments/hg3q1/kansuko_a_different_twist_on_the_classic_sudoku/c1v67hv) - /u/lawcorrection

&gt; [I like it, thank you for the great creation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WebGames/comments/hg3q1/kansuko_a_different_twist_on_the_classic_sudoku/c1vbten) - /u/jmrsplatt

&gt; [Ken ken is better.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WebGames/comments/hg3q1/kansuko_a_different_twist_on_the_classic_sudoku/c1v5jmq) - /u/Nater_the_Greater

So I fixed some of the problems they found, redid the website with better functionality, and a year later - now have a [published book of Kansuko puzzles!](http://www.amazon.com/Kansuko-Game-Based-Classic-Sudoku/dp/0764342037)

-------

To celebrate, I came up with a **Reddit/Kansuko scavenger hunt**! I thought it would be fun (to create at least) and my publisher, [Schiffer Publishing](http://www.schifferbooks.com/newschiffer/), agreed to give away 5 books. To top it off, I'll personally throw in **[Reddit Gold](http://www.reddit.com/help/gold/)** and other goodies to the first 5 people who finish the scavenger hunt.

*Warning - I love National Treasure, and well, sometimes get carried away. This scavenger hunt is meant to be difficult and fun!*

The hunt starts at [www.kansuko.com](http://www.kansuko.com) - simply type ""reddit"" as the Puzzle ID.  It might help to try an easy one before attempting the Reddit puzzle. Use the ""Check Your Work"" button as you go and when you're finished! This puzzle is about Intermediate level. 

The hunt will take you all over Reddit. I'm also posting in /r/codes, if that gives you a clue about what's to come.  To win, PM me the answer to the question. The first 5 redditors to send me the correct message will win the prizes!  I will update this post once I receive 5 answers.

Nothing in MY post history will help with this challenge.

Work alone or together, it's up to you!

Good luck!

Unfortunately after the cable was laid it was discovered that the individual wires are not labeled. There is no visual way of knowing which wire is which and thus connections at either end is not immediately possible.
&gt;
&gt;You are a trainee technician and your boss has asked you to identify and label the wires at both ends without ripping it all up. You have no transport and only a battery and light bulb to test continuity. You do have tape and pen for labeling the wires. What is the shortest distance in kilometers you will need to walk to correctly identify and label each wire? 

I have a solution that I believe produces the optimal answer.

edit: For the bulb to light up, you need to have two wires. For instance, if you have 2 wires, A and B, and you attach them to the plus and minus of the battery respectively. The light bulb will light up either way you attach the wires to it.

I decide that I want to put some stepping stones on the vegetable garden. I have five stones, and I want to put exactly one stone in each row, and exactly one in each column. No column or row has more than one stone on it.

However, I can't put the stones on squares that already have vegetables growing on them. 

I solved this today with ten 'vegetable squares'.

- What is the chance of 10 plants leaving a 'solvable' solution?
- How many plants do I need before it becomes more likely than not to be unsolvable?
- Is the probability a straight line? Does it become equally more likely to become unsolvable as each plant is added?

1343347707.0	x7x67	Two Marble Imponderables	zachbarnett	14	2	21	"**PROBLEM ONE**

You have a massive bucket containing 99,999 grey marbles and a single red one.  You select a marble from the bucket at random. It's grey. You put it back, shake the bucket, and select another. It's grey. You repeat this process a few more times, and each time you do it, the marble is grey. Suddenly, an onlooker speaks out: 

**OBSERVER**: 5 to nothing; grey in the lead!

**YOU**: What's the point in keeping score? You know grey will win.

**OBSERVER**: Perhaps so. But if you were to repeat this process indefinitely, do you think it likely that red might, at least temporarily overtake grey on the scoreboard?

**YOU**: That's almost impossible; grey is already winning by five. Soon, grey's lead will be even larger.

**OBSERVER**: I don't think you understand how long a time *infinity* is. If you repeat this process indefinitely, it is a statistical certainty that at some point, you will puil red a million times in a row. Same with a billion; a trillion. 

**YOU**: That may be true, but those runs are likely to come too late to confer the lead to red. Red is chasing a moving target; I think it's tremendously unlikely that red will ever have a lead over grey.

What do you think? If you iterate this process *forever*, is it a statistical certainty that red will at least temporarily have the lead, at some point?

-----------------------

**PROBLEM TWO**

This problem is similar to the first. You have another bucket, a limitless supply of grey marbles, and a single red one.

In the bucket are one red marble and one grey marble. You select one at random. You then put it back and then add grey marbles to the bucket such that the new total number of marbles inside the bucket is twice what it was before. Then you select another marble and repeat the process. (So after the first selection, you'll add two grey marbles to the bucket. Then you'll add four, then eight, etc.)

Suppose you iterate this process indefinitely. What is the probability of never ever selecting the red marble? Or are you statistically certain to select the red marble eventually? "	t5_2qh99	True

1372118251.0	1h053o	(OC) A puzzle i made and a question.	ifyoulovesatan	17	7	25	"I've had this idea of a kind of puzzle in my head for a while now. I don't know if it's been done before, or fun, but I figured I'd throw it out there.

It's essentialy just a spoonerism puzzle with an entertaining visual clue. A common phrase or adjective noun pair is spoonerised. The spoonerised version is then drawn out. The spoonerisms work best when both phrases are tangible objects. For example, Dying Love could be an answer for Lying Dove if it weren't too hard to represent a lying dove with a drawing. Instead, a classic like Take a Shower and Shake a Tower work well because it's easy to represent someone shaking a tower. In this example Take a Shower would be the answer.

Now I've never seen a puzzle like this in the wild, so I don't know how easy it is to follow the logic of the drawing. So I'll just post this and let me know if it's been done before and or what you think. I'm no artist so please forgive the crude MS Paint drawing.

We seek help from all mathematicians, statisticians, artists, designers, and puzzle-sovers of reddit.  

This year marks the 5th anniversary of [Pi Day Challenge](http://www.pidaychallenge.com).  My friend Matt created Pi Day Challenge for his students a while back, [more here](http://www.boston.com/yourtown/cambridge/articles/2012/03/22/pi_day_celebrated_at_hanover_high_school/).  Every year Matt spends at least 100 hours designing and building 25+ puzzles.

This year we're resource constrained.  Matt's crazy busy at an educational software company and I'm full time at a startup.  We are unsure if we have the energy and time to pull of Pi Day Challenge on our own.

So, will you help us make Pi Day Challenge 2013 happen?

* Design a puzzle. Puzzle design is perhaps our greatest challenge. First, we suggest taking the Pi Day Challenge at http://www.pidaychallenge.com. Describe the puzzle in detail, upload a drawing, or even better: create a fully functional puzzle (post here or send a PM).  Your puzzle will be seen and loved by thousands worldwide**.

* Help us with our mobile strategy.  We built the initial version in 2007 using Flash. At the time, it was an okay choice since it allowed us to get online quickly and is well designed for puzzles like these.  Things have changed dramatically and going mobile/responsive would likely help spread Pi Day Challenge even further.  Can we pull complex puzzles without Flash? Would love technical insight/thoughts here.

* Get us fired up!

** In a very short period of time!  We have experience some intense traffic spikes around March 14th:

1355755531.0	14zt8w	x-post: I've been working on a project for a couple months now, maybe you guys can help me shed some new light on it.	MorlokMan	10	0	23	"**After posting this in Design (this is a design project) I thought I might give it a shot posting it here in puzzles. The stage I'm at is more or less a word challenge. All the ""design"" comes later.**

I'm working on my design thesis and it's going pretty well. All my projects are coming together—except one. 

I'm trying to come up with a 3 word phrase that loops, each iteration of the loop has a different meaning, and it's self aware. I'll break it down for you guys:

1) *3 word phrase that loops.* This is pretty straight forward. There are three different iterations of the phrase. Word 1, Word 2, Word 3; then 2, 3, 1; then 3, 1, 2; and back to the original. 

2) *Each iteration has a different (or slightly different) meaning.* Here's a basic example. ""Dogs run fast."" It can be looped to ""Run fast [,] dogs"" and ""Fast dogs run."" 

3) *The phrase is self aware.* This is the most important part. I've come up with several good phrases (out of the 100+ I've made), but none of them are self aware. I don't mean that they're literally conscious, but that they talk about the importance of order/sequence/placement/etc. in some way. I want the actual looping of the words to be somehow addressed in the phrase. This third part is what makes the project special.

I'm way overdue on this project. **I discussed it with my prof and he suggested I post it online to see if I can get some help.** Once I decide on the phrase there's still a lot of work to be done in converting each word to images and designing posters.

Thanks guys.

To make things fair, before the game begins you decide on a number and both put in the middle that many bills/coins. (i.e. if you decide on 5, you both put in 5 bills/coins for a total of 10). At this point, you arrange the money on the table in the shape of a line. Now that the table is set, the rules to the game are very simple. Each player will take turns taking a bill/coin from either end of the line. Once all the bills/coins have been taken, each player will count his total and whoever has grabbed the most cash will win! You are chosen to go first; what stratagy can you employ to ensure you always win or tie, but never lose?  

Notes  
*Once you decide on the number of bills and coins to use, you will always end up with double that number in the line.  
*Any value bills and coins could be used, from 1 cent, to 100 dollers.  
*The money is arranged in the line randomly.  
*You must always take money from either the begining or end of the line, not from the middle.

1343346368.0	x7vw3	Perplexing Probabilities	zachbarnett	12	4	10	"True story:

In order to get a plane ticket reimbursed, I needed the receipt. I lost the original, so in order to get a new one, I needed the ticket number. The airline told me that I was looking for a 13-digit ticket number starting with '001', and that it would appear on my bank statement. 

When I checked my bank statement, I found only an 11-digit number (and it did start with '001'). I hypothesized that the bank removed the last two digits of the original ticket number (for some reason), leaving me with an incomplete number. Lucky for me, there are only 100 possibilities for the complete ticket number, given the information I had (assuming my hypothesis was correct). 

So I decided to try all of the 13-digit possibilities on the airline's website until I found my ticket number (001xxxxxxxx00, 001xxxxxxxx01, 001xxxxxxxx02, ...). As I tried one wrong combination after another, I felt myself slowly losing confidence that this process would succeed. It didn't feel like my confidence was declining linearly either. Each successive failure seemed more damning than the last. The first few wrong guesses didn’t concern me much at all, but as I got closer and closer to exhausting all the possibilities without finding my ticket, my confidence began to decline drastically. Is this rational?

Suppose that before I began guessing, my assessment of the probability that this brute-force method would eventually succeed was .9. What should be my confidence that the method would still eventually succeed
after n wrong guesses? How should my confidence change with each successive failure?

MAVEN ALERT: There are two distinct problems here. If we hold the prior probability of .9 fixed, then we get one answer. If we instead say that we should update that estimate in response to the new evidence we gain, then the problem is much harder. First do it the easy way, then try the hard one."	t5_2qh99	True

2.	There is one area in the grid where three cards with the same number are all adjacent to one another.
3.	You can't have three or more cards of the same suit adjacent in a row.
4.	Each ♠ card is horizontally adjacent to another ♠ card where the two numbers are N and N+2.
5.	The top row contains the most ♠ cards, and the bottom row contains the least.
6.	The four cards in the corners (in no particular order) are: 1♠, 4♣, 8♥, and 10♣.
7.	The 5♣ is horizontally or vertically adjacent to the following cards (in no particular order): 5♥, 8♠, J♥, and Q♣.
8.	The 3♣ is diagonally adjacent to (in no particular order): 6♠, 10♥, 10♠ and Q♥.
9.	The following cards are all adjacent to each other (in no particular order): 3♥, 4♣, 6♣, and 9♣.
10.	These three cards are adjacent horizontally (in no particular order): 4♥, 8♣, 9♥.
11.	The 2♥, 7♣, and Q♠ are in one column (in no particular order).
12.	The 1♥ is diagonally adjacent to the 1♣ and is also diagonally adjacent to the J♣.
13.	The J♠ is either two to the left or two to the right of the J♥ and in the same row.
14.	The 1♣ is either three to the left or three to the right of the 4♥ and in the same row.
15.	The 3♠ is either four to the left or four to the right of the 8♠ and in the same row.
16.	The 2♠ and the 9♠ are the only pair of vertically adjacent ♠ cards.
17.	The 2♣ and the 6♥ are in the same row but not necessarily adjacent.
18.	The 7♥ and the 8♥ are not in the same row.
19.	The 2♥ is three to the right of the Q♥ and they are in the same row.

So, her birthday is next Tuesday, and originally, I was giving her her card with some signifier that the trip would be her present.  But, then I thought:  ""She's a smart girl...let's make her work for it a bit""  I want to do a multi-step puzzle for her, with the previous answer being something that needs to be used in the next solution, that will ultimately give her the final answer of Six Flags.

I would like to start off the puzzle generically, so that she doesn't immediately sense the direction it's going.  So, I thought about an opening step with something like this:  ""You share a birthday with this actress/singer that became famous for her role in a popular show on Nickelodeon.""  I believe she'd be capable of searching famous people that share her birthday and find that the answer is Miranda Cosgrove.

There are two armies with an equal amount of *n* soldiers. Each soldier has *h* lives, i.e. it takes *h* attacks to kill a soldier. Each soldier can only attack one enemy per turn. The first army to lose all soldiers loses the war. 

The army generals have devised two possible strategies on the battlefield:

A - All soldiers in one army group-attack the same enemy soldier each turn until he is dead, and they move on to the next enemy.

B - Each soldier focuses on their own enemy soldier each turn.

Suppose army A uses strategy A, and army B uses strategy B. Find an equation that describes how many soldiers in army A survive the war, using:   
  
n =# initial soldiers in each army  
h =# initial lives of each soldier  
i = # turns

A little after noon, I found the sea very calm, and the tide ebbed so far out, that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship; and here I found a fresh renewing of my grief: for I saw evidently, that if we had kept on board, we had been all safe–that is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort and company, as I now was. This forced tears from my eyes again; but as there was little relief in that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship–so I pulled off my clothes, for the weather was hot to extremity, and took the water. But when I came to the ship, my difficulty was still greater to know how to get on board; for, as she lay aground and high out of the water, there was nothing within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, and the second time I spied a small piece of rope, which I wondered I did not see at first, hang down by the fore-chains, so low as that with great difficulty I got hold of it, and, by the help of that rope, got up into the forecastle of the ship. Here I found that the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold, but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth, and her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low almost to the water: by this means all her quarter was free, and all that was in that part was dry; for you may be sure my first work was to search and to see what was spoiled, and what was free, and first I found that all the ship’s provisions were dry and untouched by the water: and being very well disposed to eat, I went to the bread-room and filled my pockets with biscuit, and ate it as I went about other things, for I had no time to lose. I also found some rum in the great cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which I had indeed need enough of to spirit me for what was before me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat, to furnish myself with many things which I foresaw would be very necessary to me.

1356688715.0	15kfvq	Turning on the lights in another room	pazqo	11	4	6	"This *puzzle* was inspired by the glorious game [Enigma](http://www.nongnu.org/enigma/). Many levels consist in turning on the lights pairwise and you want all the lights to be on to finish the level (but you are completely aware, so it's more like a memory game). So, let's set the game.

You have two rooms, which are isolated. You cannot see what happens in the other room. In your room you have 2n switches, in the other room you have 2n bulbs (2 for each color). What you can do is manipulating the switches, with the following rules:

* you can press one switch one at a time
* each switch controls exactly one light (there is a 1-1 bijection)
* if the corresponding light is on, pressing the switch does not change the state, if the light is off, pressing the switch will turn the light on
* when two lights of the same color are on at the same time, they will stay that way, no matter what switches you press
* if there is a light (color A) on and I press the switch which turns on another light (color B), then the first one turns off and the second one is on.
* if there is a light (color A) on and I press the switch corresponding to a light which is already on, then the first light does not turn off

When all the lights are on, you task is complete. But since you cannot see what happens in the other room, you need to be sure that all the lights are on without checking. You need to do this in the minimal number of switches manipulation.

Example with 2 colors (4 bulbs, 4 switches) (check if you have trouble with the rules of if you think you have a good solution for this case)
[123142 should do the trick (I will denote (ab) two bulbs with the same color and choose an arbitrary ordering)
* (12)(34): the first two switches turn on bulbs of the same color, then I press 3, then 1 (which does nothing) then 4 and 34 are the same color, then 2 does nothing
* (13)(24): pressing 1,2,3 leave only 3 on, the 31 are the same color and 24 are the same color
* (14)(23): pressing 1,2 leave 2 on, then 23 are the same color and 14 are the same color and 2 does nothing](/sp)


The example with 6 is rather surprising, and I leave that to you (it's the reason I thought this was a nice puzzle).

There is a trivial solution, for the general case, with 2n*(2n+1) switches (121314232434), but I wonder if it possible to go from O(n^2) to O(n*log n) or something intermediate. 

note: this is not a request for a [De Bruijn Sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_sequence), which is redundant for this problem.

__________________________________________

I pick two real numbers through some process unknown to you. It might be random and it might not. Maybe I always pick ""3"" and ""100"". Maybe I roll two dice. Maybe I write C code by mashing a keyboard until it compiles and prints two numbers (or produces Windows ME). Maybe I always use 0 for the first number, and for the second I call my aunt and ask her for a negative real number, which I multiply by the estimated number of protons in the universe. (At this point, my aunt is used to that kind of call from me.)

I put these two numbers on slips of paper and put them in two envelopes. I thoroughly shuffle the envelopes, and then you choose one via a fair coin toss. You open it and look at the number. You are now given the option (as in the infamous but very different Monty Hall problem) of switching to the other envelope.

Your goal is to pick the envelope with the higher number. Can you come up with a strategy that guarantees you a better-than-even chance of winning?

It has to do better than 50% no matter how I picked the numbers--if your strategy includes the rule ""switch if the number is a 2"", it's wrong, because I could always be picking 2 and negative 100, and in that scenario your strategy will fail at least 50% of the time. This means your strategy must work even if I have guessed what your strategy is and am cherry-picking numbers specifically to defeat it.

I cannot emphasize enough that you do not know anything about my process. Not only do you not know the numbers, you don't know which random distribution I am picking them from—or whether it's even a random distribution at all—and there is no deductive basis for estimating the odds that I'm using any particular method. (This gets at what is sometimes called the difference between risk and uncertainty.)

Edit: Added that the numbers are distinct.

Solution:
[Call the number you saw ""x"". Use the logistic function to calculate p(x)=1/(1+e^-x). Choose a random real number between 0 and 1. If it's lower than p(x), guess ""lower"". Otherwise, guess ""higher"".](/sp)

[In other words, guess ""lower"" with probability p(x), and ""higher"" with probability 1-p(x).](/sp)

[This solution works because for any pair of numbers, your probability of switching is higher (if sometimes only slightly) for the lower of the two. There's no need to use the logistic function specifically—any monotonically increasing function with outputs between 0 and 1 over all real numbers will work.](/sp)"	t5_2qh99	True

**Identity Lost**

Assume there are four persons – a student, a TV license inspector, a politician, and the Devil.  
Assume you are one of them –  only you don't know which.  
Your task is to figure this out by a single yes-no question to the remaining three.

The following conditions are presumed to hold:  
(1) The TV license inspector never lies.  
(2) The student only lies to the TV license inspector.  
(3) The politician only speaks the truth to the Devil.  
(4) The Devil always lies – except when the person asking the question knows the right answer beforehand: in that case the Devil speaks the truth.  
(5) Everyone involved knows these conditions hold.

____
The following clarifications are given to serve the interpretation:  

- [The concepts of asking and answering a question allow 'reflexivity', ie. it makes sense to ”pose a question to oneself”.](/sp) (If you come to apply this idea without me mentioning it, all the better.)  

- One is said to know the right answer beforehand if and only if one can tell whether a given answer is truthful without recourse to the other answers to the question.  
- No 'observational' information is available apart from the given answers.  
- ”Given answers” bear no meaning other than a set of three yes-or-no's.  
- The persons involved speak the (un)truth according to the conditions 1-5 alone – whether or not they know who they are themselves.  
- ”A single question” means one and the same question for everyone.

The tinted passenger-side window rolled down and a semi-automatic handgun poked its barrel out.
	Pauly Gillespie, mob informant and federally protected witness, stood frozen in his tracks, his worst fears looking like a definite possibility. Pauly's FBI bodyguards threw themselves on top of him, but not before two shots erupted and Pauly had taken a bullet in the shoulder.The Cadillac screeched across two lanes of traffic. 

But it made the mistake of turning left down an alley and getting stuck behind a double-parked delivery van. The two hit men scrambled out and raced away, right into the arms of four off-duty officers. Having heard the shots and sirens, the officers grabbed the running men and held on until the FBI caught up.
	
Special Agent Brown was new to this unit and was always given the boring, inconsequential jobs. In this case, he was told to clear the Cadillac out of the alley so that normal traffic could resume. Brown adjusted the rearview mirror, backed the car out, and drove it around to where his colleagues were reading the Miranda rights to their suspects.
	
Brown stood and watched. One of the handcuffed men was tall, lean, and sullen. The other was a good five inches shorter, Agent Brown's height. Large but short, he spoke animatedly, gesturing freely with his hands.
	
Agent Fordney, director of the unit, seemed exasperated. ""They ditched the gun back in the alley,"" Fordney growled.
They ditched their gloves back there, too. All right, boys, I'm going to ask you again. Which one of you is the shooter?""

Alan Spade was a tad more sanguine. ""He was a stinking cheat and he deserved to die. I was livid, but we all paid up and we left the rat in one piece. Someone must've come back, but it wasn't me.""
	
Joseph Blush, an English professor, seemed an unlikely gambler. ""At first, we all won our share. But as the evening progressed, we lost more. I don't suppose you can give me my money back."" The police assured him that no money had been found in Bugsy Ferret's suite.
	
""We should bring one of them in for questioning,"" the sergeant said after the final interview.

Rules:

Several termites have stumbled across a perfectly good rotting log in the middle of the woods.  Look at [this section](http://i.imgur.com/zPG3D.jpg) if you don't believe me.  Well...finders keepers.  The only problem is, they need to figure out a way to divide this bounty fairly among themselves. 

1. The log is broken up into cells containing various amounts of sustenance.  The bugs can enter a cell in the log through any opening in the bark adjacent to their current position.  They cannot exit and reenter the log at a different location.

2. The bugs can claim a contiguous region of cells.  Specifically, they can move between any cells that share an edge, not just a vertex.  Bugs must claim whole cells.

3. There are two classes of termites, labeled A and B.  All members of each class must get an equal amount of conveniently quantified sustenance.  So if an A eats 30, all A's must eat 30.

4. These termites are very territorial.  Because of the massive infighting, no A regions can directly touch any other A regions and no B regions can directly touch any other B regions. 

5. I don't really know that much about bugs.

Here's that image link in case you missed it: [http://i.imgur.com/zPG3D.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zPG3D.jpg)

You have 12 elephants.  11 of those elephants weigh the same.  1 elephant is different (you don't know if it's heavier or lighter).  

You have a balancing scale, and you are allowed 3 tries on the balancing scale.  

How can you find out which elephant is different?  

------------

I've tried and tried.  My approach is to try and split the elephants into groups of 3s or 4s and weigh them against each other, eventually eliminating and finding the different one.  The best I can do, though, takes 4 tries on the balancing scale.  I just can't do it in 3 tries.

An enemy submarine is somewhere on the number line (consider only integers for this problem). It is moving at some rate (again, integral units per minute). You know neither its position nor its velocity.

You can launch a torpedo each minute at any integer on the number line. If the the submarine is there, you hit it and it sinks. You have all the time and torpedoes you want. You must sink this enemy sub - devise a strategy that is guaranteed to eventually hit the enemy sub.

They wish to exchange gifts so that nobody knows who has received their gift and nobody knows whose gift they have received. They have no other friends who will assist in the exchange. They are all also experts at tracking movement of objects and always win the shell game whenever they encounter a non-scam version of it. (So if they pass their gifts around in a circle, they will know who got whose gift.)

How can they exchange these gifts in a guaranteed finite amount of time while ensuring that nobody receives his or her own gift back? They can use cards, dice, or computers to accomplish this.

[I have no solution in mind. Well, I have one mediocre solution, but I'm not satisfied with it. I want to see what you all can come up with.](/sp)

EDIT: My solution. I'd like to hear something more elegant though:

Matching:[Create a stack of notecards, each with the same symbol on both ends of one side. Shuffle them up. Cut them in half so you have two stacks with the same random order of cards. Cyclically shuffle one stack. Then reveal cards from the top of each stack into pairs: the left is the symbol of the gift you're giving, and the right is the symbol of the gift you're receiving. With a second independently shuffled stack of the same symbols, hand one secretly to each participant. So now each person knows the symbol of the gift they are holding and the symbol of the gift they will be receiving.](/sp)

Exchanging:[Put 17 larger, opaque boxes in a room, each labeled with one of the symbols. One by one, each person enters and places their gift in the appropriate box, so they do not know which boxes have already been filled. Then, after everyone completes the placement, everyone returns in the same order, one by one, to retrieve the assigned gift (without knowing which gifts have yet been taken).](/sp)"	t5_2qh99	True

Some of you might find this useful.

I found a [site](http://puzzles.about.com/od/freeeasynytimescrossword/Free_Daily_Easy_New_York_Times_Crossword_Puzzles.htm) with some older M, T, W crossword puzzles - 505 of them. I spent a couple of hours writing a few scripts to download them (they not all in the same download location), give them uniform names (they have a dizzying array of naming schemes - I've named them m001-puz.pdf for the first Monday puzzle, w151-sol.gif for the solution to the 151st Wednesday puzzle, etc. based on the numbers used on this site).

Next, I converted the gif solutions into pdf files as well and then pair-wise merged puzzle and solution files. Now, I have 505 pdf files that each have a puzzle on page 1 and the solution on page 2. If you have your printer set to full duplex printing, you can print a page with a puzzle and the solution on the reverse!

This should keep me busy for a bit :) If anyone else wants these files, let me know.

See [#18](http://aqjm.fsg.ulaval.ca/fileadmin/AQJM/Enseignants/2012-2013/demi-questionnaire.pdf) for the original version.*

Matthew, who always walks with a speed of 4.5 km/h, found out how to leave for school as late as without ever arriving after 8:30. See [this](http://i.imgur.com/OIc3vQx.png) for a rough visualization.

He noticed the 'Walk' signals at the two pedestrian crossings are lit for 15 seconds and off for 45 seconds, both at the same time. They don't display how many seconds are left before they're not lit anymore, on can only see 'Walk'. They are also visible from any point on the street. However, the exact time at which they light up cannot be predicted for any given day. Matthew only sees them from the moment he reaches the intersection between his house's street and his school's. The signal has to be lit the whole time when Matthew crosses the street.

**At what time, on average, will Matthew arrive at his school, knowing that as soon as he's out of his house, he tries to get to school as fast as possible?**"	t5_2qh99	True

For example, this puzzle:

SSFTWT?

(Spoiler contains how to work out the above puzzle. May be a big hint so only view if necessary.)

[You have to work out what letter should replace the question mark in the sequence. In this case, the answer would be 'M'. The sequence is the first letter of the days of the week in backwards order starting from Sunday: 'S'unday, 'S'aturday, 'F'riday, 'T'hursday, 'W'ednesday, 'T'uesday, 'M'onday.] (/sp)

Some of these are quite hard and a few aren't common knowledge. I have ordered them in what I think is easiest to hardest, but some people might find the easy ones hard and vice versa.

1. OTTFFSSE???
2. VIBGYO?
3. KPCOFG?
4. TSPHHON?
5. ESNRSHS?
6. AAAANAAAAA???
7. NBRRYNLG??

(Note: Sequences with two question marks is a two letter answer, as if you were adding another two letters to the sequence. Three question marks has a three letter answer etc.)

Post your answer(s) in the comments and I will tell you if it is correct or not. I will not put the answers in this text so you can avoid the temptation to peek at the answers. Yes, I can give hints if you ask nicely :)

Create a 5x5 board, where each square contains a letter. Then, try to find the names of U.S. States with your letters. When going from letter to letter, like in Boggle, you may go horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. However, unlike Boggle, you may return to previously used letters in one word. You are scored on the following criteria. For each state that you get, take the number of letters in that name, and add that to your score. For example, if you found Indiana (7 letters), Rhode Island (11 letters), and Iowa (4 letters), then your score would be 4+11+7=22.

**Across**

1\. Area of Dog's Mead in square yards.  
5. Age of Farmer Dunk's daughter, Martha.  
6. Difference in yards of length and bredth of Dog's Mead.  
7. Number of roods in Dog's Mead x 9 down.  
8. Date (AD) when Little Pigley came into the occupation of the Dunk Family.  
10. Farmer Dunk's age.  
11. The year when Mary was born.  
14. Perimeter in yards of Dog's Mead.  
15. The cube of Farmer's walking speed in miles per hour.  
16. 15 ac. minus 9 down

**Down**

1\. Value in shillings per acre of Dog's Mead.  
2. The square of Mrs Grooby's age.  
3. Age of Mary, Farmer's youngest.  
4. Value of Dog's Mead in pounds sterling.  
6. Age of Farmer's firstborn, Ted, who will be twice as old as Mary next year.  
7. Square of number of yards in breadth of Dog's Mead.  
8. Number of minutes Farmer takes to walk 1½ times round Dog's Mead.  
9. See 10 down.  
10. 10 ac. x 9 down.  
12. One more than sum of digits of digits in column 2.  
13. Length of tenure (in years) of Little Pigley by the Dunks

Also: One of the 'across' numbers is the same as one of the 'downs'. This is the only case of identity, though one number in the puzzle (relating to something quite different) happens to be the area in roods of the rectangular field known as Dog's Mead.

Modern help: As this puzzle is from 1935, you might need to know that 1 acre is 4840 square yards, 1 rood is one quarter of an acre, and 20 shillings makes one pound sterling.

Short story long: I work for an organization that does sea turtle conservation in Central America. We recently placed a satellite tag on a sea turtle that nested on a beach we patrol. We need to come up with a name for this turtle for tracking her movements. We would like to name her after the team of local community rangers who have been protecting the sea turtle nesting beaches, and the way we would like to do this is by incorporating the first letter of each guy's name into the turtle's name.

The letters for incorporation are:
SDJFMEFK (for Salvador, Daniel, Jairo, Fernando, Marcos, Erick, Felix, Karen)

It would be fine to incorporate additional letters to make some name that exists, as long as we can get those 8 letters above in also. Two names is fine. I am just terrible at word puzzles. Can anyone help me out?

**This is a two minute mystery from a book called ""The Little Book of Bathroom Crime Puzzles"" by M. Diane Vogt**

'I think she's our killer,' Jerry said. He put a few coins in the vending machine and waited for the coffee to dispense. He raised his eyebrows, his way of offering to buy her a cup.

Linda shook her head in disgust, folding her arms over her chest. 'You're such a cynic, you know that? This woman is grieving the loss of both parents right now.'

'Look, she met a mystery guy at her mother's funeral'

'So?'

'And according to several peoples' accounts, she was flirting with him. She later searched for him but couldn't find him.'

'That only means she wanted a date; it doesn't mean she's a killer.' Linda was determined not to lose this argument. They had bet five bucks on the outcome.

'Flirting? At her mother's funeral?' Now it was Jerry's turn to be disgusted. 'There's something weird going on there. That doesn't sound like the behaviour of someone who's emotionally stable.'

'Maybe the tall, dark stranger is our guy,' Linda suggested. Maybe he was using her to get to her father.'

'Doubtful. I admit he's been tough to locate, but there's just no motive there.'

They walked down the hallway to the psychiatrist's office. 'Let's just wait and see what the doc says before we arrest her for her father's murder, okay?' Linda pushed the door open, allowing Jerry to walk in first.

Dr. James was waiting for them. He tapped the manilla folder on his desk containing the suspect's medical chart with his glasses. 'Sorry, Linda. This girl has a long history of psychopathic behaviour - she was serving her own interests. She killed her father. No doubt about it.'

Linda was amazed. 'But why would she kill her father right after her mother died?'

The most important thing to keep in mind is that **the blocks can rotate independently**. So when a face refers to the face above or below it, it could be any of the four faces on that block.

I ran some tests and I believe there is one unique correct solution (which leads to the final answer). I'd like to find out if I'm right!

The first puzzle was a big success at my school with a lot of people playing and two people solving it from scratch correctly.

I've been asked to do another puzzle, so here's what I'm starting with.
The puzzle (in real life) consists of 4 large blocks ('cubes', but not really) in a vertical stack. They can be spun independently and freely. I will paste the following 16 faces onto them, making a big, interactive puzzle. [Here's](http://imgur.com/a/pBQtA) what the current one looks like.

This new one starts with my take on the [famous self-referential quiz](http://www.drunkmenworkhere.org/170). Because the blocks can spin, it has the added element of different configurations for self reference, like ""The block below this one has an answer of...""

[Here's the first draft of the first part of the puzzle.](http://i.imgur.com/gLkic.png)

**Remember, since the blocks can be spun independently, each of the 4 rows in this image can be shifted relative to each other. The individual faces on each strip will be fixed relative to each other, of course.**

What I'm interested in knowing is:

1. Is it solvable (of course) and is my solution correct?

2. Are there other solutions or is this one unique?

3. How did you solve it? Logic and eliminating wrong answers? Or with a bit of computer programming?"	t5_2qh99	True

1370737916.0	1fyeco	What time is it? A counter intuitive logic puzzle.	Slackluster	11	10	21	"I ask you ""What time is it?"" You can take only one instantaneous measurement of a digital clock showing hours and minutes to see the exact time. To achieve the highest degree of accuracy, what time do you say it is?

[My thinking is that it's more accurate to say the next minute, for example if the clock says 3:45 you would be more accurate in reporting 3:46. This also applies in real life scenarios where you are just glancing to see what time it is. The exception being if you see the time change while you are looking at it then it would be more accurate to report that time.](/sp)

[I know this isn't very complex but I just think it is interesting, especially considering that when people ask me what time it is I normally just say the current time because accuracy doesn't really matter that much and if anyone found out that I was always reporting the next minute I think people would think I'm weird. This actually has some technical applications with computer graphics. The game engine I am developing has a system that rounds measured time deltas to the next vsync which is kind of a similar concept. ](/sp)

(Click [here](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=solvepuzzles) to join from your browser.)

Right now, the room is totally dead. To attempt to fix this, I'll run two promos (basically *bribes*). 

First, I will give permanent operator privileges (admin) to any person or group of people that is able to solve a (hard) puzzle I made: [here](https://sites.google.com/a/brown.edu/zb/puzzles/walldisskneeBriecents). There are no instructions. Feel free to come to the channel now to work on it.

Second (since I don't anticipate many people solving my puzzle), I will be giving permanent operator privileges to several other channel members after we become large enough to warrant it. If you (a) are in the channel often, (b) are at least a little bit active (chatting occasionally), and (c) help me recruit new members, then I will probably make you an op of the room (once we get a respectable number of visitors).

If you know any communities that would likely be interested in a room of this sort, please pass my message along. Happy hunting.

1365784888.0	1c7qw1	How would you do it?	Fatnose	3	0	1	"There is a lightbulb (incandescent, it's currently off) in an upstairs room. You are downstairs, standing next to a panel of three light switches (all of them in the off position). One of them controls the lightbulb. The other two don't do anything. You must figure out which switch controls the bulb, with some restrictions.

1) You can do whatever you want to the lightswitches, as long as it's either turning them on or turning them off.

2) After fiddling with the lightswitches, you can go upstairs and check the bulb.

3) You cannot see the bulb nor any light shining from it from where you're initially standing.

4) You cannot make multiple trips up and down the stairs.

5) The lamp is in the ceiling and you don't have a ladder.

6) You are a mutant with 15-foot-long arms, so #5 is moot.

So, you fiddle with the switches, you walk upstairs and check the bulb, and then you immediately decide which switch controls the bulb.

1357759029.0	169iij	The pop quiz paradox—a logic question	petethehuman	11	6	8	"I once read a logic puzzle with this same paradox. I couldn't figure it out then and I couldn't figure it out when I encountered the puzzle in a real situation. 

I had a professor this past semester who promised 10 pop quizzes throughout the semester. The end of the semester was drawing near, and he warned that we had one pop quiz remaining. I reasoned the following:

Well, it wouldn't be a surprise if it were the last day of class, so we can rule that one out. Then the second-to-last day becomes the new last day. So, we can cross that one out as well. Of course, this reasoning soon arrives at the conclusion that on NO day would the pop quiz truly be a surprise. The days wound down. The last day of class came, and there was a pop quiz, and I was not surprised. But would I have been surprised if it had been the second to last day? That requires the possibility of the final day having a quiz, thus not being a surprise. The possibility of the last day having a quiz is necessary for any of the earlier days to have potentially surprising quizzes. 

I'm a lover of logic puzzles (though new to this subreddit), but I just can't figure this out. 

The original puzzle, if anyone was wondering, was a similar scenario in which someone had to take a pill by surprise. They asked their friend to bake the pill into a cake so that they would be surprised. They then ate the entire cake, save the last piece, and told their friend that they could not be surprised. If anyone knows the original puzzle, it would be much appreciated.

I've bounced a lot of ideas around and I think I've come up with the following mechanics.

The questions are always in the form of ""What's so special about _______?"" where _______ is either a commonly known person or object with an uncommonly known fact or where it is a person or object that is not commonly known.

For example:
Q: What's so special about Pluto?
A: It used to be considered a planet.

Given the question the contestants ask yes or no questions to get to the answer.

The second mechanic to the show would be that the contestants can suggest changes the rules of the competition after answering a question right and that the host would generally grant the rules changes provided they aren't entirely unfair.

I'd like to get a test run going soon. I was thinking 3 contestants on each of two teams, but for the test runs it might be easier to limit it to 1 contestant per team.

If there is enough interest I may do a test run as soon as tonight.

1337139388.0	tpeed	Cross a bridge at night, full of holes, in 17 minutes...	theberneser	4	1	8	"* Four people need to cross a bridge that is about to collapse.

* It will collapse after 17 minutes

* The bridge is full of holes so you have 'one' torch to navigate around them (so you don't die)

* The bridge is already weak, so only 2 people at a time can cross it

* The first person is fit and able to cross the bridge in 1 minute

* The second person hurt his ankle, and he does it in 2 minutes

* The third person has crutches, and takes 5 minutes to cross the bridge

* The fourth person is in a wheelchair with flat tires and wobbly wheels, therefore takes 10 minutes to cross


In what order do they need to cross before the bridge collapses?

Let’s imagine that everyone in the stairwell, me included, travels a constant one floor per 15 seconds, either up or down. I start from the top, eighth floor, run to tag floor #1 (the ground floor) and then immediately go back up, like hell’s own yo-yo. And during the half hour I run, everyone’s going to lunch and so they travel ONLY down the stairs — they enter at a certain floor and walk all the way to floor #1 (the ground floor), where they exit.

Here’s the tricky part: people enter the stairwell at every minute multiple of the level they enter. For example, one person enters on the 6th floor at minutes 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 (and they walk from the 6th floor, down); likewise a person enters from the 8th floor at minutes 8, 16, and 24 — again walking down. (Fugheddabout anyone entering at the first, ground floor because that would be silly.)

You cannot look inside a box, however you are allowed to pick any two boxes and ask whether or not they contain balls of the same colour, or different colours. You won't find out what the colour(s) inside actually are, you just find out if they are the same or different. You can ask as many times for different pairings as you wish.

**Your aim is to, in as few questions as possible, point to a box which contains a ball of the majority colour.**You don't need to know what colour that actually is, you just need to find a box which is guaranteed to contain a ball of the majority colour. So, if you had worked out that boxes A, B, and C contained balls of the same colour, then you can just point to A; it must be the majority colour.

What is the mininum number of questions you must ask in order to be certain you've found a box which satisfies this?

-

Five boxes is fairly simple, so:

Harder: What if you had seven boxes instead of five?

Much harder: What if you had (2n+1) boxes, where n is an unknown natural number?

I am now trying to organize them in a certain pattern but the exact placement is hard... I have boiled it down to a simple pattern puzzle, so you don't even need to know about Set. So here it is:


Organize 40 numbers 1, 2 or 3 in a 10-wide by 4-tall grid. Use 13 1s, 13 2s, and 14 3s. (The value doesn't matter, so you can use ABC as well)

Each row makes overlapping ""sets"". A set is 3 different numbers, or the same number three times. (Another way to say it: it's NOT a set if only two numbers of the three are the same.) The first 3 numbers in a row make a set, then the third number starts a second set, and so on: sets are in position 123,345,567,789. The 10th number makes a set with the 9th, and the 1st in the next row (the last row wraps and makes a set with the first as well). You end up with 40 numbers in a loop, making 20 overlapping sets. Easy, if not for the column restriction. 

Each column of 4 cannot be repeated in another column, even if offset (1333 and 3313). The offset also applies to the same column so 1212 won't ever work.

My attempt/example:

    3211132221
    3332111322
    2133321113
    2221333212

But there are two 2312 columns...

    3211123331
    2223111233
    3122231112
    3331222312

This has 2213 and 1322 conflicting.

    1111132222
    2133333211
    1113222221
    3333312223

Has got 1313.


EDIT: Okay it's solved by our resident expert on bubblebaths.

EDIT 2:

But I found a new constraint: Don't use a both a column and its complement. 1113 Complements 1112, so both can't show up, including offsets. 1233/1322, 2223/3323, etc. This leaves only 10 columns ( and matching offsets or complements) to choose from, to fit 10 slots! Now it's just a matter of ordering these and choosing which offset/complement to use!

The available columns:

    1111111122
    1112222222
    1221223323
    2233232333

The complements (minus complements which are also offsets):

    111 11113
    111 33333
    133 33223
    332 32322

1316874233.0	kq1di	Can you help me color these cubes?	fuctape	4	2	5	"There's an art installation at my school, out in the quad. It's 4 large cubes, each of which can rotate independently, end-over-end.

Right now, they're painted with eyes and ears to make rearrangeable faces, [as seen in this picture](http://pomfretschoolad.org/misc/Cubes.png).

Here's the puzzle: I want to paint the faces of these cubes in 4 colors: red, green, yellow and blue. The goal is to find a color scheme for the 16 faces such that there is only one possible rotation scheme that makes all 4 rows have all 4 colors. This is like the famous [Instant Insanity cubes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_Insanity) without the extra dimension for rotation.

So, what do you think? Is there a grid of colors that leads to only one unique solution (with all the rest having repeats and/or not all 4 colors in a row)?

As a random example, I'm looking for a grid like this and the proof that there is one unique combination:
    
    RYYG
    RGBY
    GBRG
    BRGB


I'm sure this one doesn't work. Just to be clear, the letters could be rotated in columns, but their relative positions (in columns) are fixed.

Can you help? I'm working with it in Excel, but I'm sure there's some code that could hammer it out quickly.

If a solution is found here, I'll post pictures of the actual piece when we're done, hopefully later this week!

Apparently no love over at /r/math. This is a problem of my own creation and wanted to see what people here thought. I submitted the solution to a mod to verify this isn't just a troll or stupid guessing game. I am sharing this because I think people will be genuinely amused by the answer.

Hints:

[spoiler](/s""This problem is objectively logical and if you get the answer you will have NO doubt it is the one and only answer. I am sure there are plenty of boring coincidences."")

[spoiler](/s""It is not complex, just special. Its just a matter of how you look at it."")

Hint / Why I think it is interesting:

[spoiler](/s""The three 'incorrect' answers represent a unique / complete set, ie It would not be possible to come up with a 5th option."")

Disclaimer / JUST in case you have doubts or it needs to be clarified:

1. [spoiler](/s""One of the properties that makes the set unique is that all the words have six letters. Removing that quality, there could be other members of the set..."")

2. [spoiler](/s""...but not larger than 6"")

3. [spoiler](/s""Technically, it is a unique subset of English and not ALL words in every language..."")

4. [spoiler](/s""...and to get really technical, by English I mean the words in the common English dictionary of a default English install of Ubuntu Natty 11.4 (/usr/share/dict/words)"")

1337942396.0	u4agx	Instead of solving a puzzle, help me make one	AbramLincoln	2	0	1	"The goal is to design a 7-layer puzzle that can fit on a USB and will be complex enough that it will take the recipient 4 years to solve. If that doesn't interest you, stop reading now.

Each layer will consist of a series of files that serve as clues to reach the next layer, which will stored within a folder of that directory. The folder will require a password (that cannot be easily solved with a keygen) that can be gained with the help of the aforementioned clues. I assume I can do that easily with Windows Explorer (the security tab in the properties window for folders seems to allow this easily enough)
Here's where the fun begins. I came to you guys to troubleshoot any obvious problems with this plan. For instance, the very last layer will contain an executable file that must somehow notify me when the recipient has completed the puzzle. It must withstand the test of four years. Would a simple ping be adequate?

And encrypting the clues is another idea I'm toying with. I want the first layer to be music based. I was thinking of having a set of obscure songs renamed as numbers, that when rearranged in alphabetical order by song title would reveal the first password. The difficulties would be in removing all kinds of track descriptions and perhaps making all the files 'read-only' so they can't be tampered with and the first puzzle can't be solved by electronic means. I want the recipient to search.
Said recipient isn't too computer literate to begin with, so I won't need anything terribly complicated. Nevertheless, it's an unorthodox request, and I was hoping that some redditors would be interested enough to help brainstorm some ideas.

So shoot.

TL;DR

Think of crazy puzzle shenanigans that can be easily put on a USB

This is a two minute mystery from a book called ""The Little Book of Bathroom Crime Puzzles"" by M. Diane Vogt

Theresa fished the key out of her purse and opened the front door while Emelda gathered the cleaning supplies from the back of the van. ""Mrs Fernandez said Chad would be here to clean the pool while we work today"" Theresa said.

""I don't like him,"" Emelda replied. ""He scares me""

Theresa shrugged. ""He killed that guy by accident and he's done his time."" She walked straight from the front door to the kitchen and loaded the dishwasher.

Emelda headed for the bedrooms. ""Once a killer, always a killer.""

""If you ask me, Mrs Fernandez is the one you should really be scared of,"" said Theresa. ""That lady would sell her own grandmother. Mr Fernandez tells me all the horrible things she does to drive him crazy.""

Emelda poked her head around the corner and gave Theresa a long, hard warning stare. Mr Fernandez and Theresa were having more and more of these private talks. Emelda was worried that they were going to lose their jobs if Mrs Fernandez found out. Theresa ignored her.

The two women worked steadily, cleaning the house from top to bottom. Four hours later, the home was spotless, but Chad had not arrived. Emelda was disgusted. ""We can't just wait here all day. We've got two more houses to clean before I pick my daughter up from school.""

Theresa kneaded her forehead with her fingers, wincing at her migraine. ""You go ahead. I'll just meet up with you when he gets here.""

""You sure? I don't like leaving you here alone with him.""

Theresa nodded, waving Emelda out the door. ""It's fine. You'll just be down the street.""

When Theresa didn't show up at the next house, Emelda did the work herself. At the third house, Emelda began to worry. She called Theresa at 3:15pm, but the phone kicked into voicemail after just a few rings. She left a message: ""Theresa, where are you? I'm going to finish the Smyth's house and then go get my daughter. I'll see you tomorrow.""

Mrs Fernandez returned home to a sparkling clean house at 6pm. When she walked to the backyard, she saw Theresa's body floating in the dirty pool. She brought her hands to her mouth in horror. ""Oh Chad! What did you do?""

When the police finally arrived, they pulled Theresa's body out of the pool. Among the belongings they found in her pockets were her keys, her dead cellphone and an empty change purse.

When the police located Chad and brought him in for questioning, he told them that he had arrived at 3pm, saw Theresa's body in the pool and took off, fearing that he'd be blamed.

**Had Theresa accidentally fallen into the pool?**

Not every night, but every so often, two cars, one going east and the other west, converge directly across the street so that from my point of view, they're both passing the telephone pole that sits there, at the same time.

So, if on average:

1. I sit for 15 minutes;

2. 20 cars pass by at random intervals, some going east, some west;

3. cars travel 35 miles per hour;

4. a car is 17 feet long;


What is the probability that on any given night, two cars will pass each other going in opposite directions, directly across from where I am sitting, each passing the telephone pole at the same time?

They are all sitting facing towards Andrew. Meaning Charlie can see Bernard and Andrew ( from the back ) ; Bernard can only see Andrew(from the back) and Andrew cant see anyone.
For the sake of illustration;
&lt;Andrew&lt;Bernard&lt;Charlie

They are all sentenced to death, but with a twitch.

The guy who is supposed to handle the death sentence(Lets call him Gray) has 5 hats. 3 of witch are black and 2 of which are white. He gives you an assignement:

Gray puts a hat in random to Andrew, Bernard and Charlies head.

If ANYONE from 3 of the prisoners can say what colour hat he, himself,  is wearing then EVERYONE will stay alive. If anyone guesses wrong then everyone will be killed. Everyone has 60 seconds to do so.
If noone guesses their hats colour in 60 seconds then everyone will be killed

When 59 seconds have passed then Andrew, the guy who cant see anyone, rises up and says the colour hat he is wearing and he is correct.

Question: What colour hat Andrew was wearing and how did he know?

Claims:
#1: Noone can speak or give signals towards what colour hat the person infront of them is wearing
#2 Everyone are super intelligent.
#3 Noone can see the hats that are left over ( 5 hats in total; 3 of which are used)

1357267617.0	15xe3e	A Prisoner Puzzle from Car Talk	zachbarnett	3	2	35	"In Ray's words:
&gt;This puzzle has been making the rounds of Hungarian mathematicians' parties.

&gt;The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, ""You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.

&gt;In the prison is a switch room, which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the on or the off position. I am not telling you their present positions. The switches are not connected to anything.

&gt;After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.

&gt;No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.

&gt;But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time anyone of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'

&gt;If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators.""

&gt;Here's the question:

&gt;What is the strategy the prisoners devise?"	t5_2qh99	True

There are 4 people standing in a line all facing one direction, we call them A B C and D.
Two of which are wearing black hats, and two of which are wearing white hats. There is a wall between person C and D, so no one can see what color person D is wearing.
Person A can see B and C; person B can see person C, but not A.
Everyone is told that there are a total of 2 black hats and 2 white hats. However they are not told that the hats must alternate in color. (Example: if person A wears white, person B has to wear black and C has to wear white) 

They are standing like this if you are confused.
all facing -----&gt;
A B C | D 

*Of course no one can remove their own hat, turn their heads around, or ask what color hat someone is wearing.

The question:
Who is the first person between the four to be able to figure out what color hat he is wearing?

Also provide an explanation of your choice.

On the way, the bellboy couldn't figure out how to split $5 evenly between 3 men, so he gave each man $1 and kept the other $2 for himself.

I visit this site Chessgames.com which is a database of half a million famous historical chess games.  Every year they have this Christmas contest in which they hide prize banners (64 of them) on specific games in the database.  The cool thing is that they also release clues between now and xmas to help us find the right game.

I confess, I have ulterior motives:  I am out to win this year, the grand prize is this LED chess clock that I'm drooling over. So maybe if I can drum up interest in the puzzles here, my fellow redditors can give me help :D

Sometimes you have to be a total chess nerd to get the clues.  Like the first clue this year showed a graphic of 11 fish, and you were supposed to think of Grigory Levenfish, the famous Russian-Polish grandmaster who was Leningrad champion in 1922.  (Oh, but of course!)

Most of the time though you don't need to know anything about chess at all.  A knowledge of math, trivia, and thinking-outside-the-box gets the job done.

Clue #3 from this year's contest was of the second variety.  They called it ""Zwischenzug"" which is a chess term for an ""in between move"", but other than that detail you didn't need to know anything about chess.  It was just a list of 14 integers. I almost had it... I was deciphering the final clue when suddenly somebody else solved it :(

The test consisted of two parts: the first one was a test of knowledge somewhat similar to the math section of the SAT, and the second part was of straight numerical aptitude. The second part had 10 numerical patterns and I remember getting 9 out them, which was good... though I had an average score in the knowledge part. Well, one of the questions of the numerical test was the pattern above and I am curious about what you think of it. Also, do you have any idea why they were assessing both math knowledge and pattern recognition? It seems like the job of the schools should be to improve knowledge, so why would they add a separate aptitude test?)

In tribute, I've created two alphametic puzzles below, in tribute to them. The challenge is to replace each letter with a digit, so that the equation holds true. 

The standard rules of alphametics apply:

* Each letter represents a unique digit. 
* Numbers must not start with a zero. 
* While a given letter may represent a particular number in one puzzle, it may or may not represent a completely different number in a different puzzle. 
* Each solution is unique 

.

bill + eddie = gilda

2nd puzzle:

A gram or more of sorbitol.
More than a miligram but less than a gram of phosphorus.
More than a milligram but less than a gram of of sulfur.
A gram or more of lithium.

Clue 2. 
A FORTRAN or COBOL subroutine.
An integrated circuit.
A floppy disc (any size). 

I suspect that Clue 1 refers to some type of firework but I don't know?
Clue 2 might just be referring to a floppy disk with some code on it but I can't figure out what a COBOL subroutine is or if a floppy disc even has an integrated circuit on it. Any help with these clues would be greatly appreciated!"	t5_2qh99	True

It would be close to impossible to search for the “perfect” mate because chances are, you might never actually find “perfect”, and you’ll end up with nobody because the searching never ends since you never know where to stop. You might have lost your chance with Mr. 90%-good-enough, simply because you keep searching for someone better.

So the question is – how do you know when to stop? When is the probability such that you likely won’t do any better than the person you’re currently with? How do you know to stop at Mr. 90%? How do you know he’s 90% when you don’t know what 100% looks like?

1364290723.0	1b17bc	Need some help with a formula to handicap scores in a competition. [ REDDIT GOLD AVAILABLE ]	throwawayhugo	3	3	3	"Hi all,

I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this kind of thing, but I figured someone would be familiar with manipulating numbers and figures.

I'm creating a competition where the most improved customer (in terms of sales volume compared to their previous trading year) wins a prize. Note: When I say 'customer' I actually mean a reseller of our product. The aim of the competition is to incentivize our resellers' sales teams to sell more of our product.

However, a large % of our business comes from a small number of customers, broken down as below ( this can be seen in the spreadsheet linked)

* 2 customers = 43%
* 9 customers = 32.7%
* 9 customers = 11%
* 14 customers = 10%
* Remaining customers = 3.6%

Currently, as decided by other (more senior) people, the competition currently exists as the most improved customer based purely off of sales as a % increase.  e.g. customer had 50,000 units of sales last year, this year he sells 55,000 - a 10% increase.

Obviously, given the distribution of volume shown above makes this competition unfair, as the largest customer has 3,000,000 volume of sales compared a smaller one of 10,000.

To make the competition fairer it was decided that 50,000 would be the minimum volume to enter the competition.

This was satisfactory to everyone, however, I later discovered this meant only 30% of our customers qualified, and there still existed the problem of being unfair to larger businesses, as if one of the smaller companies won a single large account they would gain a large % increase over their previous year and win the competition.

So my proposed solution: A handicap to be placed on the companies which scales by volume. e.g. For every extra 10,000 volume a 0.5% multiplier would be added to the % increase of business.

Customer 1 previous year: 100,000
Customer 1 current year: 120,000
Increase 20%
Increase with handicap 21.2%

Customer 2 previous year: 400,000
Customer 2 current year: 470,000
Increase 18%
Increase with handicap 21.6%

Using the above formula there is a slight advantage that can be seen from dealing with a larger volume. However, it’s quite complex (probably needlessly so). Here is the spreadsheet with the formula I developed. If this link breaks PM me for a new one.

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_P0LTB1J3UIc1Yzck15aHRhM0E/edit?usp=sharing

I’d like your collective help in thinking up a new/improved formula to handicap the lower volume resellers to make it fairer for everyone. Or a complete redesign of the competition which also makes it fair for everyone.
As this is for a competition it needs to be as simple to understand as possible.

If anyone provides a better solution I’ll give them reddit gold. I know this isn't a large reward, but hopefully it's a small puzzle some of you may enjoy!

If there is somewhere more appropriate to post this please let me know!

This is a screenshot of one of the hardest levels (the easier levels would be waaaay too easy for this subreddit) ""resistors"" of my upcoming iOS-App called ""COMBIN3"".

Each label/drawing on the 12 keys in the picture has these 3 aspects:

Property 1: the numerical value
(1.3 / 2.4 / 5.6)

Property 2: the order of magnitude
(Ω, kΩ, MΩ)

Property 3: the visual representation
(plain value / equation / picture of resistor)

A correct combination (solution) consists of a set of 3 keys, so that each of the above properties is
- identical on ALL 3 selected keys
OR
- different on ALL 3 selected keys

There are exactly 14 correct combinations to be found. For posting solutions, think of the keys numbered from 1 to 12, starting at the top left key as #1 and counting along the rows to the bottom right key #12.

One of the solutions is, as an example:

[Key #1 (= 5.6 Ω), Key #3 (picture of resistor with red/yello/green/golden ring = 2.4 MΩ) and Key #9 (equation 3.9kV/3A = 1.3 kΩ) make up a correct combination, because: Property 1 (numerical value) is different on all 3 keys, Property 2 (order of magnitude) is different on all 3 keys, Property 3 (visual representation) is different on all 3 keys] (/sp)

1357307033.0	15y72f	The Mathematical Black Hole	pazqo	3	3	2	"You all know the nice problem: take a number A1, spell it (in English) and count the number of letters (=A2), then iterate this process with A2 to get A3 and so on. You end up to 4, no matter what number you start from. If you do the same in Italian, you end up to 3 (=tre). We call such a number a ""black hole"" (edit: a black hole is a number that is self referential. If you end up in a loop, no element of the loop is a black hole! --&gt; Once you are in a black hole, you cannot escape!)

* In Japanese there is no black hole. Why?

One, who don't really know base logic, can argue that a sufficient condition for the existence of a black hole is that there is only one autoreferential number (such that the number of letters of the spelling is actually equal to the number itself).

* Point out a counterexample to the previous sentence.

edit: just to be more clear. Find out a language which have a single self-referential number but this is not a black hole.

Only check the third question once you have found the idea for point 2)

* [Is there a language with a &gt;2 loop? I don't mind if there is a self-referential number, just care about the longest loop!](/sp)

1. It should be language independent, since the game will be localized to a number of them.
2. No keyboard entry, all by point and click.
3. I was thinking a good starting point would be to have an area on the screen where the riddle appears, below which is an answer field, and below that a number of buttons with which you enter something in the answer field.
4. You could enter the scene with a riddle sheet. Alternatively, you can enter it with some item that activates the sphinx (depends on the nature of the riddle.
5. It's for a casual games audience.
6. Should be fairly simple to represent on screen with static assets. Answer and riddle fields, not a whole lot of buttons/dials. Could have a riddle sheet next to it to serve as a cipher, or not.

Here's one I was toying around with:
The riddle area shows ""1?"". The answer field shows ""(blank)+(blank)-(blank)"". You have 5 buttons, each featuring shapes of roughly the same sizes - an irregular triangle, 4, 5 and 6 sided irregular polygons and a loop (no vertices). 

The idea is to have players figure out that the number of vertices for each shape represent the value to be entered in the mathematical equation. Therefore, the answer would be (Triangle), (Rectangle), (Hexagon).

I thought I'd share it with everyone because I think it's really cool.

First, the finite version, palatable for a general audience.

&gt; A finite number, let's say **n**, of mathematicians are given hats and are asked to simultaneously guess the number written on the given hat. They know every hat is numbered between **1** and **n** (with possible repeats and possible exclusions), and they know the number on every other person's hat, but not their own. How can the mathematicians scheme before being hatted, so that **at least one** mathematician guesses correctly?

And secondly, an infinite version, which requires the Axiom of Choice (and thus better suited for abstract mathematicians).

&gt; An **infinite** number of mathematicians are given hats and are asked to simultaneously guess the color of the given hat. They know every hat is either **black** or **white**, and they know the color of every other person's hat, but not their own. How can the mathematicians scheme before being hatted, so that **all but finitely** many mathematicians guess correctly?

And if you really want to go abstract...

&gt; Let **kappa** and **lambda** be any cardinals. **Kappa**-many mathematicians are given hats and are asked to simultaneously guess the ordinal written on the given hat. They know every hat is has an ordinal between **0** and **lambda**, and they know the ordinal on every other person's hat, but not their own. How can the mathematicians scheme before being hatted, so that **all but finitely** many mathematicians guess correctly?"	t5_2qh99	True

Four adventurers stand in a line. Can you use the following hints to decipher their order, their race and their class?

* One adventurer has a name starting with the same letter as his class.
* The Dragon and the Juggler are in opposite ends of the line.
* The Cook is between the Lizardfolk and the Flea.
* Legrolas and Grimli are best friends and always stand next to each other.
* The Guitarist is between the Sorcerer and the Goblin.
* No adventurer has a name starting with the same letter as his race (so Frodro is definitely not a Flea).

You find yourself at Central Park watching a version of the three card monty, but in this game the guy is placing a pebble under one of three tin cups and then rearranging them, betting that you won't pick the cup he placed it under. He offers you 3 FOR one odds, so in theory, the game is a zero-sum game. First wrap your brain around that fact. You will win once every three times, if the game isn't somehow rigged. This gets boring fast, so then he gives you a new twist option. He will put a pebble under a cup, rearrange them, and then let you make your choice. But it gets better! After you choose the cup you think a ball in under, he will show you one of the empty cups you didn't pick and then let you change your choice to the other lone remaining cup at your option! WOW!

The king was infuriated with 100 of his servants that weren't capable of working together properly. So the king decided to put them in jail, and give them a challenge that requires cooperation:

Each prisoner is locked up individually, but every day one (presumably different) prisoner is put into the spare room. As soon as any prisoner realises that all prisoners have been in the spare room at least once, he may call the guard. If he correctly states that all prisoners have been in the spare room at least once, they are all released. If he states it incorrectly, they are all executed. There is a single switch in the spare room, that is switched off initially. The switch is supposed to be the only means of communication, any attempt to circumvent this restriction (like scratching on the wall, shouting, etc.) leads to execution. The guard is somewhat fair; meaning that he selects the prisoners in such a way, that given enough time, each prisoner will visit the room arbitrarily often.
[It is possible that some prisoner p goes quite often, while another prisoner q has never been since time t, but eventually it is guaranteed that q will go back into the room.]

The servants can agree upon a strategy before becoming prisoners (knowing the goals and restrictions), what would you suggest?

An example of a somewhat fair guard, is a guard that purely randomly selects a prisoner each day. After how many days would you expect to be free?"	t5_2qh99	True

Unfortunately, they have no way of checking it directly because the waters around that island lack reflection. Of course, everyone can see the eye colour of the rest, but they don't trust each other so communication is also out of the question. Before leaving, though, the captain says one last thing ""I see at least one person with blue eyes"".

Assuming that no one will try to answer until they are sure (and they will answer as soon as they are), and that everyone knows this is also true for the rest:
