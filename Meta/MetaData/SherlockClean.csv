1353104731.0	13blyg	"“I’ve been online and looked at all the theories,” Moffat told us, “and there’s one clue that everyone’s missed. It’s something that Sherlock did that was very out of character, but which nobody has picked up on.”
"	thebeatsandreptaur	407	58	201	"Moffat said this in an interview. I think it may be this. After Sherlock saves the kidnapped kids he goes to speak to the girl in the interview room, she screams at him thinking he is the kidnapper. Sherlock just drops it after that. He never discovers who the kidnapper is or why the little girl thinks its him. **When has Sherlock ever stopped investigating some thing until it was completely solved?** He never even mentions the kidnapper again. That's not Sherlock he has to know every little detail. This also means that some one who looks a lot like Sherlock is out there.

So knowing that this is my theory. Some time during the episode Sherlock catches the look-a-like and probably kills him (after all hes ""On the side of angles"" but isn't ""one of them""). We all know about the big truck with the plastic bags. I think Sherlock jumps into that. Either rolls the dead look-a-like out of the truck or its brought by the EMT's if they are actually the homeless network. The truck then pulls away taking Sherlock with it. The EMT's then take the body of the look-a-like to the morgue where Molly falsely identifies it as Sherlock. Or maybe she is tricked, Sherlock says he may die to her and maybe she takes one look at it, starts crying, and says its him.

At least that's my two cents. Any other guesses what the out of character thing may be? 

**Edit**: ~~I just noticed some thing else. The body that's supposedly Sherlocks has a wound on the left side of his head. The body is laying on its right side. You'd think then that the wound would be on the the right side, the side that hit he concrete?~~ On second thought and a few comments this part of the theory is probably stupid. "	t5_2ryt0	True

The rest of the mods and I like to leave the subreddit mostly as-is to encourage free discussion of BBC Sherlock-related topics, but since Season 3 has started filming already, here is a reminder of the rules we will be enforcing as filming continues: 

* DO NOT POST any images you (or others) have taken of filming, and do not post the locations or dates of upcoming filming.

* Please do not post any spoilers in the title of your posts or any image spoilers that could show up as a thumbnail. These posts will incur swift deletion. 

Spoilers include any pictures taken of the filming if you or anybody else should happen to snap photos. Spoilers include the title of the episodes as well as who might be cast in them. This may eventually be common knowledge around certain places (Tumblr, DigitalSpy, etc.), but do not post these spoilers in the title, because not everybody wants to be spoiled.

* Those posts that do contain spoilers for Season 3 should be conspicuously marked ""SPOILER"" so nobody accidentally clicks on the content. 

Any other spoiler grey-areas will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the mods.

Thanks!

-Your /r/Sherlock mods

**edit**: P.S. repeated offenders posting SPOILERS in the title may be banned. Warnings will be given, but flagrant violation of the rules will not be tolerated."	t5_2ryt0	True

Before Sherlock jumps, the last time him and John have a face to face interaction is when John receives the false call that Mrs. Hudsen was shot. 

John starts yelling at Sherlock, calling him a machine and implying he wasn't a friend. 

Fast forward, Sherlock is now ""dead."" John doesn't know Moriarty forced Sherlock to jump, he doesn't know that he was almost shot if Sherlock hadn't. All he knows is right after he verbally attacked Sherlock... Sherlock killed himself.

Then I realized that John must think he drove Sherlock Holmes, his best friend, to suicide.

""I don’t think the bike hitting John was organised, I think it was a genuine accident. I don’t think Sherlock asked John to “keep watching him” to prove that he died or anything like that. I think Sherlock asked John to keep watching him, so that John could see the trick which would keep Sherlock alive, but when the cyclist hit John, it stopped him from seeing a vital clue into how Sherlock was still alive. Sherlock didn’t want John to see him die, he wanted him to see him survive."""	t5_2ryt0	True

Anyway, here’s my fall theory in all its glory, feel free to pick it apart. (God knows I’ve done it enough to everyone else’s theories)

1) First off let’s talk about Moriarty vs. Sherlock and who’s the smarter play.

In an outright battle of wits, I’d guess that these two would tie, but that’s not what we’re dealing with here. We’re dealing with Sherlock solving Moriarty’s puzzles and that’s an entirely different ball game.

How Sherlock works is that he takes the clues he finds and puts them together to solve the puzzle. If he doesn’t have enough clues, then he can’t solve it. Moriarty is a master of setting up the clues as he sees fit. Remember, he thinks like Sherlock so he knows what Sherlock’s going to see when he looks at a case. That’s how he was able to pull of the “gay” deception during “The Great Game” and set up the kidnapper’s footprints to lead Sherlock to the children earlier in this episode, because he knew how to string together the clues so that Sherlock could solve it.

In the case of the fall, everything Sherlock was able to deduce is something that Moriarty literally spelled out the clues for. The three I.O.U.s to mark the victims. The ""I owe you a fall"" to foreshadow the suicidal leap. Moriarty is leaving only the things he wants Sherlock to find and hiding everything else. The Richard Brook twist came out of nowhere because there were no clues for Sherlock to follow to make that connection. The same goes for Moriarty shooting himself.

This is very traditional Doyle. In the original novels, Moriarty was often several steps ahead of Sherlock so Moffat and Gatiss keeping to this theme fits.

2) “I owe you a fall.”

Moriarty left enough hints that Sherlock could figure out he was going to have to jump or suicide in some way, but just because Sherlock knew that was going to happen doesn’t mean he was in control or able to set the stage to his liking.

Though he knew he'd have to fall, that was all he knew. He couldn't know what Moriarty planned to do down to the letter because Moriarty is “soooo changeable” and due to the fact that even a genius couldn't know for sure what Moriarty had set up, he could only make educated guesses. Guesses that, if they were wrong, would lead to the deaths of the three people Sherlock cares for the most.

The main thing Sherlock couldn’t know for sure was how many people Moriarty had watching (“unless my ***people*** see you fall”), what they'd look like, or where they'd be. This being the case, Sherlock couldn’t have someone rescue him in a manner that would be detectable from any viewpoint. He simply couldn’t risk it.

As a side note, the sniper who's watching John isn't one of these people. He didn't even glance at Sherlock's body, he simply watched John. Moriarty wouldn't give one person the task of watching both Sherlock and John, he's far too thorough for that. (Criminal Genius, remember? One doesn't get that title by half-assing things)

No, Sherlock knew what was going to happen, but however he survived had to be a way that anyone watching would believe.

3) So, how did he do it then? 

He simply jumped.

If a human totally relaxes their body, such as one does when unconscious, it's possible to survive a long fall without dying. This is because, since your body isn't tense, the impact is better absorbed by your body. If you’ve ever had blood draw, you know that they tell you to relax because otherwise it hurts more and it’s harder to take the blood. This is a similar principle, but on a much grander scale. But how would Sherlock relax his body?

Ever read Romeo and Juliet?

In the play, Juliet takes a drug that simulates death by weakening her heart rate and making her breathing incredibly shallow. Such drugs do exist and taking one would allow Sherlock to both relax his body enough to up his chance to survive and appear dead at the same time. Such a drug or the ingredients to make one could be procured by a medical professional like Molly. I would guess he either took this drug right before he came to the roof or during his ""moment of privacy"" the he literally pleads with Moriarty to have. (This is possibly his out of character action that Moffat keeps hinting at)

It would help explain why Sherlock starts to hyperventilate on the roof. The drug is starting to take effect, but he has to wait until he's sure it's about to work. Thus the phone call with John.

There are other steps you can take to help survive a fall detailed [here]( http://www.wikihow.com/Survive-a-Long-Fall). If you read through this, Sherlock does everything you see on the list, save for the tips on how to land.

4) But that's such a risky move! Why would Sherlock do that?

Because he had no other option. Sherlock is a risk taker. He was willing to swallow a potentially poisonous pill just to prove he was clever, why wouldn't he be willing to risk death to save his friends?

This also mean that, when Sherlock talked with John, he knew there was a chance this really was the moment of his death. The fall truly could kill him and he still told John to tell people he was a fake.

Would I bet my life this is the right theory? No, but it's the most plausible one to my mind. If this turns out to be right I will be immensely pleased and if it's wrong then I'm just another silly theorist.

Thanks for reading this little tome, now make me feel silly by telling me where I went wrong and I’ll try to defend myself.

EDIT: There are some issues several people have mentioned. I'll address them now.

5) Well, if Sherlock did fall, what happened to his scars?

As far as scars go, we only see his face in that final frame, not his whole body.

[When you look at the body,](http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/28300000/Sherlock-S02E03-The-Reichenbach-Fall-sherlock-on-bbc-one-28354913-624-352.jpg) you see that Sherlock only has one, obvious main facial wound right at his hair line. 

At the ending shot, [that spot is covered by hair](http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/28300000/Sherlock-S02E03-The-Reichenbach-Fall-sherlock-on-bbc-one-28355528-624-352.jpg). So, Sherlock could have a healing wound that we just don't see.

It's hard to tell from all the blood if he has wounds on the other side of his face, but that doesn't really matter since we don't get to see that side of his face. He's standing so that you can only see one side of his face and you can't see the other side clearly when he turns to walk away because he turns to fast (I framed through the scene, his face is a blur).

Plus, we don't actually know how much time has passed since the fall in that scene. If you look [at the grave John's standing in front of,](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-k_5QNtLRwDY/T7mmqxzgXMI/AAAAAAAADOc/Is0ZV3FGlz0/s640/Benedict+Cumberbatch+as+Sherlock+Holmes+and+Andrew+Scott+as+Jim+Moriarty+on+Sherlock+Series+Two+Finale+The+Reichenbach+Fall+6.png) it's not freshly turned. The grass has had time to grow a bit and you have to look closely to tell that the ground there was dug up. This leads me to think this shot takes place quite a while after the fall. Maybe even a full month or more.

This is supported by the fact that we see John sitting in a chair in 221B after the fall, but by the time this scene takes place he's living somewhere else. Remember, Mrs. Hudson asks him to come to the flat:

MH: There’s all the stuff, all the science equipment. I left it all in boxes. I don’t know what needs doing. I thought I’d take it to a school. Would you ...?

JW: I can’t go back to the flat again – not at the moment.

The conversation also shows that she's had time to box everything up. 

6) One final note on the rooftop scene

This is something I only just thought of, but that is very important. ***Sherlock didn't know Moriarty was going to kill himself.*** That means, however Sherlock survived, it was a way that worked *even if Moriarty was watching.* "	t5_2ryt0	True

My theory on this, is that HE CALLED john. Multiple times throughout the series he notes how he prefers to text people and not call them. Throughout the entire series, he NEVER makes a call (only answers them). I dont really know what it could mean (maybe i prerecorded message?) any thoughts/opinions 	t5_2ryt0	True

Start of production on the third cycle of the fan-adored detective drama has been moved from January to March. Sources say the shift was necessary to accommodate the busy schedules of the show’s breakout stars, Benedict Cumberbatch (who’s filming Star Trek 2) and Martin Freeman (starring in The Hobbit)."	t5_2ryt0	True

Moffat and Gatiss have said we're all missing one big thing about The Reichenbach Fall. I think it has to do with Moriarty's body. The newspaper that Mycroft is reading after ""the fall"" says, ""Suicide of Fake Genius - Fraudulent Detective Takes His Own Life.""

I think that if Moriarty's body had been discovered on the roof, the headlines would have been much different. I do believe Moriarty is dead, as Moffat and Gatiss have said, but I think that the absence of anyone mentioning that ""Richard Brook"" was also found dead is significant. Since the whole Richard Brook issue had just been in the news painting Sherlock as a fake, finding his body at the same crime scene as Sherlock's would be HUGE news and lead to a TON of speculation (did Sherlock kill him to shut him up? Were they working together? etc.)

I don't know where that body went, but I honestly don't think it was discovered.


*ETA: Just found this quote from Moffat at Comic Con: ""Moffat dismissed the notion that Moriarty faked his death. ""He can’t come back from that,"" Moffat said. ""He shot himself in the face. What more do you want?""""*"	t5_2ryt0	True
1367686478.0	1doo78	May 4, 1891	WallflowerIAm	191	28	5	"Here's to the day in history when Sherlock Holmes ""died"" while he confronted his nemesis Moriarty.

""The actual ledge from which Moriarty and Holmes apparently fell is on the other side of the falls to the funicular; it is accessible by climbing the path to the top of the falls, crossing the bridge and following the trail down the hill. The ledge is marked by a plaque as illustrated here; the English inscription reads: ""At this fearful place, Sherlock Holmes vanquished Professor Moriarty, on 4 May 1891."" The pathway on which the duel between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty occurs ends some hundred metres away from the falls. When Doyle viewed the falls, the path ended very close to the falls, close enough to touch it, yet over the hundred years after his visit, the pathway has become unsafe and slowly eroded away, and the falls have receded further back into the gorge.""
