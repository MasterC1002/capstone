When i was like 5 years old i borrowed a movie to a friend (VHS) and when I got it back there was another movie inside the case.
I watched it and i was amazed. I think that it wasn't a ""kids"" movie because there was gun fights and some violence but at least was something different than Disney back then.
I'm not sure how old was the movie but it was 2d animation with an obscure dark blue color theme. Was about aliens and laser gun fights and space ships (the guy controlled the space ships by putting his hand inside a blue/transparent matter, like connecting his body). The aliens spoke a different language... i think it was made up and there was subtitles for that. 
I'm sorry I can't remember much more but I would like to know the name of that movie please. :C"	t5_2rnhx	True

1347825696.0	zzgzr	'High Road' (2011). A refreshing stoner comedy.	PandEyez	2	2	0	"Being someone who finds a lot of the 'stoner comedies' to be very annoying, this was a hilarious and very refreshing watch. A great cast (Joe Lo Trugilo and Ed Helms to name a couple) mixed with a simple, entertaining plot line, lead this movie to make it as one of my top comedies. 

Worth a watch, I think it's on the US netflix. Would love to hear others thoughts and opinions.

1284116243.0	dc13c	I just watched this movie	sarahpalinstesticles	3	4	0	"Okay this is going to be a huge wall of text because I can't not say what I feel after watching this movie.  Also tons of spoilers ahead.

So I couldn't sleep and was looking for movies On Demand.  Didn't feel like paying for one so I was browsing free movies and came across Jennifer's Body for free becuase I have a subscription to HBO.  So fuck it I say maybe Megan Fox will take her top off.  Well this movie was seriously the biggest pile of dog shit I have ever seen.  Where to start?  

Well the movie opens with some chick who looks sorta like Dakota Fanning.  Not 100% on that nor do I care to check.  She's in a mental hospital looking place and some caregiver is recommending she not eat Pop Tarts for lunch but they don't call them that they call them something like Toast 'Ems.  Prob cause Pop Tarts doesn;t want their name associated with this pile of excrement of a movie.  Anyway she pulls a Lui Kang and kicks this lady across the room.  This lady that outweighs her by like 100lbs.  After being put in solitary we see this is going to be one of those the whole movie is a flashback from the beginning.  

So its starts out ""again"" with the whole Megan Fox is hot and is popular and is suprisingly friends with the other girl who is not.  MF invites her to see some band at some shithole bar in their shithole town that's suprisingly called ""Devils Kettle"".  So theyre at the bar and somehow it catches fires.  So the other girl is like hey we can run into the bathroom and jump out the window.  Meanwhile everyone is getting stampeded inbetween burning alive.  Outside the lead singer happens to already be standing there with a drink in his hand.  So he just invites MF to take a ride in his rape van.  Like seriously?  The place just burnt down and half the town died and these people act like nothing happened.  So she disappears into the van and the other girl instead of waiting for authorities maybe I don't know help some of the wounded bar patrons just drives home.  Then MF shows up covered in blood puking black shit.  After she helps herself to some Boston Market she rolls.  Instead of maybe calling the cops and ambulance or Buffy the other girl cleans up the black vomit and blood and heads off to bed.  

So then all the school is in mourning because a bunch of ""students"" were at the BAR on a schoolnight.  I mean yeah that makes perffect sense.  So J Jonah Jameson is a teacher at the school and has a hook for a hand.  Why?  No idea.  There was no backstory that I was aware of.  So then we see MF come back and she starts eating the male students.  It's obvious real quick that she needs to eat people to keep herself looking pretty and shit.  So they keep finding these male students with their insides missing and keep holding memorials.  

Then  there is a scene were MF shows up in the other girls bed and they start making out.  Hands down the only watchable 31 seconds of the movie.  So after they're finished kissing MF explains what happened to her the fateful night when the Double Duece burnt down.  So apparently this band named ""Low Shoulder"" want to be famous.  So what does any band that wants fame, fortune etc do?  Turn to the occult.  So it flashes back once more to when MF got in the van.  It immediately becomes apparent this isn't the Mystery Machine when there is perfectly arranged brand new misc occult books lying around in the van.  Yes the plan on sacrificing a virgin (MF in case you're not paying attention) and get famous.  So they take her to the towns claim to fame.  A waterfall with a sinkhole after it.  In the beginning scientist were throwing these balls down because nobody can figure out where it goes.  Deep down to the pits of hell where this movie belongs.  You remember Twister?  Yeah that movi where Helen Hunts crows feet started becoming really really noticeable.  Those little balls in those torando machines is what they reminded me of.  Or red ping pong balls,So they toss the knife in there after the get done singing the 8576309 song.  No seriously they sung that before the brutally murdered this random girl to make them famous.  Seems logical to me.  

So cut back to what would of been a pretty hot sex scene and MF goes all Spiderman and jumps out the window.  So then there is the dance that the other girl thinks is going to be a buffet for MF cause now she knows she eats dudes.  Okay so she's going to this dance to eat all these kids.  The same kids she went to school with everyday.  I went to make a sandwich at this part so I'm hoping there was some backstory to Captain Hook and maybe he died I don't know.  So the other girl breaks up with her boyfriend who I left out of all this for some reason.  She breaks up because ""it's not safe"".  Whatever that means.  So the dance happens and somehow the other girls boyfriend and MF end up in a typical abandoned swimming pool.  You know about 3 feet of green water and shit ton of leaves.  So she bites the dude and then the other girl comes in and they fight.  They end up having a 2 minute convo consisting of all one liners.  Then the boyfriend pulls a ""let off some steam Bennett"" and impales her with a fence pole.  MF then pulls it out and asks the other girl for a tampon.  Yep a tampon.  Also MF can fly.  Or hover. Or CGI or whatever.  So the boyfriend dies oh no.  MF is like fuck this noise I'm going home and putting on those legging things that women from the 80's wore.  So Cyndi Lauper is sitting in her bed watching an infomercial.  The one with the guy with the ponytail and excersize equipment.  Anyway the other girl pulls a Tony Jaa or Jason Statham or Jet Li or any other action star that routinely jumps threw windows unscathed into a combat roll.  So she has a boxcutter and there is some dialog and turns out when they were kids playing in a sandbox MF got a thumbtack stuck in her hand and the other girl licked up the blood, you know normal shit you did when you were a kid.  So theyre like blood sisters or somethng I think I don't know.  So while the other girl is on top MF does her David Blaine and they are hovering over the bed.  So she has a boxcutter and shes like I'll just rip this BFF necklace off because we def arent friends anymore.  So she dies and the other girl gets sent to the looney bin.  

So flash forward back to the nut house.  The other girl is in solitary and she says how when you get bit oh yeah MF bit her, you gain there powers.  Hmmmmmmmm seems beliveable.  Anyway the camera cuts back and shes in a Buddha pose levitating.  Then she busts out.  One thing bothers me tho.  She's been in there for how long and she has all these powers she just sits there and waits for a sunny day to bust out?  Anyway remember those red ping pong balls?  Well as she is casually walking down the street after the jailbreak she sees them on the side of the road.  She bends down and the knife used to kill MF is there.  So these scientist who couldnt figure out where the hole went and its dumping on the side of the road?  

So the credits roll and we see that the other girl murders the band.  Oh and when she picked up the knife the camera flashes to a sign on the road......Low Shoulder!!!!! OMG the name of the band.  It's all come full circle in some ice cream turd on my front lawn.  

Seriously I paid nothing to watch this movie and I still want my money back.  


Other random stuff I think I forgot.  

The other girl does some research on the occult in a library....with books.  WTF this town doesnt have internet access?

There was a sex scene between the other girl and her bf.  It was weird, I don't know if it was the first time the characters had sex but the actor who played the bf is def a virgin from the way he was acting like he was sexing Dakota Fanning lookalike

The had one scene were the introduce the mother of the other girl.  Like why?  What's the point?  She was in the movie for one scene.
