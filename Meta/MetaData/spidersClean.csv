1343064757.0	x0wzx	How r/spiders cured my 5-year-old's arachnophobia	callsignViper	123	16	20	"Prior to finding r/spiders, I wasn't necessarily afraid of spiders, but I didn't really like them and wouldn't hesitate to kill them. My daughter had a nightmare about a spider after I killed a scary looking one in our garage the night before. She woke up screaming and refused to sleep anywhere a spider could be hiding (which ruled out everywhere except for snuggled tightly into her mom's arms). I felt bad, and so I tried to find some cute spiders on the internet the next day to help her realize that not all of them are scary or dangerous. 

This is where you come in. I started browsing through pictures and seeing the appreciation and even beauty of spiders. I decided to start treating them a little nicer, and have done my best to convince my wife and daughter to do the same. I have since spared the lives of many spiders, moving them safely outdoors or just letting them chill inside. We've identified a few of our favorite kinds and my daughter has started calling them ""jumpy"" and ""charlie"". She even had the courage to touch a jumpy spider to make him jump! I've let them crawl on my hand and let her watch. 

The only really dangerous spider in our area is the black widow, and they're pretty rare. I told her what they look like and how we should handle them when they're found, but to otherwise be nice to spiders. Her arachnophobia has taken a complete 180, and she's now excited whenever we spot Charlie hanging out in my office, or Jumpy hopping through the grass.

Thanks r/spiders!

[Citation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11700827)
Since the citation lacks an abstract, I'll summarize:  

The authors report two cases of eye exposure to squashed Pholcids (daddy long-legs).  A man squashed a spider and later rubbed his right eye with the same hand.  This resulted in ""severe burning pain"" and swelling to the point of obscuring his vision - this lasted about 6 hours.  In a second case, a woman smashed a daddy long-leg and subsequently wiped her eye with the same hand.  Her ""eye became red and itchy...eyelids and sclera became swollen and there was a thick discharge from the eye. Her vision was obscured.""  Swelling resolved by the next morning; itching lasted for 3 days.

The authors discuss that spider guts include digestive enzymes, and there is evidence the midgut is cytotoxic with sphingomyelinase and collagenase.  Note sphingomyelinase is the enzyme in brown recluse venom responsible for necrosis.

They also reference two prior reports: one in which ""a fragment of a widow spider landed in a person's eye, causing immediate periorbital reaction and also systemic effects, probably as a result of *subconjunctival venom absorption*"". In another case, a man hit a big spider presumed to be a huntsman or wolf spider ""with a hammer, ejecting body contents into his eye.""  This caused itching and significant swelling which ""almost obscured the cornea, but settled over eight hours.""  The authors speculate that the similarity of the reactions suggest that it could happen with any spider.

How is that for karma?  All of these spiders would have been harmless if they had just left them alone or caught and released them.  Live and let live!  "	t5_2r1sf	True

Instead, I'm more curious about them then I ever was thanks to all of the beautiful photography I see of them on here. Couple that with all of the informative users on here stamping out the ignorance most people have about spiders and my fear's been turned inside-out.

I found a little guy in my bathroom this morning and for the first time I wasn't frightened. I found a cup and a sheet of paper, gestured him into the cup and set him outside my window. The leg span couldn't have been wider than a US nickel. My only regret is that I didn't have a camera to snap a photo.

So thanks, /r/spiders! Hopefully I can begin to educate others that spiders are in fact quite awesome."	t5_2r1sf	True

A little while back i posted on [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/spiders/comments/13aysv/are_pictures_of_scorpions_acceptable_here/) asking if it was ok to post pictures of scorpions on here since [/r/scorpions](/r/scorpions) was inactive.After some photo taking today I was able to get some good shots off my phone (please bear with me) that I think you guys will like.


**Backstory**


I live on desert property in arizona and I basically wander around outside and find these guys.I keep them in little critter totes with ideal temperatures and food.

**The Scorpions**

[This](http://imgur.com/a/eqKNG) is Taz, he is an adolescent Striped devil scorpion(*[Hoffmannius spinigerus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoffmannius_spinigerus)*).He is pretty active all the time and glides across his habitat.He has quite the attitude at a young age.When you remove his bark hide he freezes and then begins to start running frantically around his enclosure only to stop when you put back his hide.The venom is non lethal although I have not tried handling him and I dont think i will any time soon to be completely honest.He can be fed by tweezers which is pretty neat.If you havent ever seen a scorpion feed on prey you should go check it out.


[This](http://imgur.com/a/ACvMy) guy however is not so nice.This is Daedalus and he is an adult Arizona bark scorpion (*[Centruroides sculpturatus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_bark_scorpion)*).This is the most venomous scorpion in north america and it is considered a major pest here...Obviously not for me.It is really cool to own a apex predator but it is **no** laughing matter.These guys can seriously pack a punch and hospitalize some with weakened immune systems.He is a really unique character as he is much slower than Taz.He likes to walk pretty slow with his chelae in the air and wave them around (Might be a warning sign?) but when he knows he is in deep trouble he hauls it around his enclosure.

Thats it for now,I would be happy to post more if you guys found this interesting.And ill answer any questions you guys have for me.

They didn't stay very long, but the li'l girl was very interested in the two Spitting Spiders I keep as pets. She wanted to look at them and wanted to know all about them, and how they spit and why they're called spitting spiders.

She asked me if he would bite, and I told her ""Sure, he *can* bite, but that doesn't mean he will. In fact, I've tried to make him bite me. He won't do it. I'll give you $5 if he bites me.""

In fact, she thought they were so cool that she wanted me to get one out and show it to her up close. REALLY up-close. When I coaxed Fangy out of his home and into my hand she immediately cupped her little hands and held them up and said ""I want to hold him!""

So I let her hold him. This 7 year old girl let the spider crawl from one hand to another, up and down her arms, whatever. She didn't even care. She thought Fangy was the coolest freakin' thing in the world. I mean zero fucks were given by this kid. She was all, Whoah, a spider! He's so neat!

I gave her the $5 anyway. Just for being an awesome little 7 year old kid who apparently is as unafraid of spiders as I am. She wants to be a veterinarian when she grows up. "	t5_2r1sf	True

Spiders have been no exception to this, but i would still smash them if they were in my room. I couldn't stand the thought of them wandering and hiding where ever they wanted because i was sure they were just going to seek me out to crawl on me and creep me out. I've been fine with being outdoors and observing them with some distance between us, but would scream like a girl and run away if i found one in a unexpected spot (turned over a log and found a 2' fishing spider). I've been subscribed to this reddit for a while now and after learning about them, and how harmless they are, I've grown a new respect for them. just 5 minutes ago, i was out smoking behind my shop, and lifted the lid to our butt bucket. What looked like a young, dime sized, almost yellow sac spider colored, wolf or fishing spider decided to hitch a ride on my hand and proceeded to crawl up my arm. I calmly grabbed him and placed him in a safe spot in the bushes.   Just wanted to thank you guys.... thats all.	t5_2r1sf	True

1350390247.0	11kev9	Well r/spiders, after years of living under the shadow of fear I'm getting over my phobia of spiders.	thebigcheddarman	59	4	9	Like the title says, for years I've been afraid of spiders. When I was little I found spiders fascinating, then when I was around 7 I saw what I thought was a Black Widow in my tub, along with some other spider I don't remember. I knew Black Widows were dangerous, but my young mind warped that into believing they could kill me near instantly. Since then I've lived in fear of spiders and killed them whenever I could. It's been 15 years and with the help of subreddits like this one and r/whatsthisbug I've realized that the spiders I've been killing and have been afraid of all this time have been harmless and beneficial. I realized I became to spiders what I believed spiders to be to me: a heartless dealer of death. I've rediscovered my fascination in spiders and will now try to relocate any I find inside the house rather than kill them. I'm not sure why I felt the need to post this but this feels like as good a place as any for an Arachnophobe's Anonymous type of post.	t5_2r1sf	True
