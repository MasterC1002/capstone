Do you remember what it was like when you first traveled to a foreign country?  Say it was Rome.  Every experience on that trip felt like Rome itself.  The airport itself was Rome saying welcome.  Every interaction, from the cafe waiter, to the hotel desk clerk, to the museum guides, they were all expressions of Rome.  The smell of traffic exhaust was uniquely Roman, as was the trash on the ground, the humidity after the rainstorm.  All of these things were as Roman as the Coliseum.  Rome was not a place, not a city, but a living experience.  This is what happens when you see the world without the veil of identity and thoughts, and you are just a wanderer with no role to play.

When you go back home, the airport is just a bore.  Traffic exhaust just smells like exhaust.  Trash is an eyesore.  Humidity is just unpleasant.  The cab driver is rude.  Even the landmarks are unremarkable.  This is what happens when you see the world through your identity, the role you are obliged to play.

Meditation is closer to the traveler's mind, where you are open to the vastness of the world, and can then see *everything* as expressions of that one thing."	t5_2qnc9	True

1366225379.0	1cjuop	Pragmatic advice from 20+ years of experience	FappingFop	382	37	87	"**EDIT**  This post really is only intended for beginners.  Most people who have meditated regularly for a year or longer are probably way past any of the advice below.

Recently I have seen some great discussion on this subreddit and it sounds like there are a lot of people who are just starting into meditation and coming here for advice or to share some of their experiences.  Great.  I wanted to put together a post that sums up some of the lessons that I have learned along the way in hopes that someone will find it useful.

First a little bit about me.  I started ""meditating"" when I was very young and I couldn't sleep at night my mother told me to do some really basic breathing exercises that were just very simple meditation.  In fact, this is where most people start.  Count your deep breaths.  I moved into some creative visualization and ""wiccan"" slanted meditation/ritual for a while, then made a hard shift towards zazen (zazen is sitting... just sitting) and have been there ever since.  I have also practiced a martial art which incorporates both active (like tai chi) and passive (sitting) meditation.  I have tried other styles and continue to experiment but the combination of zazen and active meditation really does it for me.  And this is my first lesson:  experiment.  There are so many ways to meditate do not settle into a single dogma until you have felt out all of the possibilities.  Everyone's mind is very unique, so don't be discouraged if vipassana or zazen doesn't work for you.  That said...

... don't give up easily.  Frankly the first few days or weeks or months of meditation kinda suck.  And sometimes even the people who have meditated every day for years go through spells where it isn't easy.  Legs cramp, backs ache, for some reason you keep salivating (well, I did at least)....  There are a hundred little problems that you'll face off at first and some will be a constant struggle.  Don't give up.  Expect them and know that it is part of the practice.  Here are some common problems/questions people have.

""I can't shut down my brain.""  Good!  You aren't supposed to and you never will.  No one, **no one** who meditates has a completely empty head for his thirty minute sit.  I think this is one of the most common misconceptions about meditation and it leads to a terrible spiral where the practitioner is thinking about how frustrated he is that he can't stop thinking about how frustrated he is.  Instead of silencing our minds, we learn techniques to quiet the mind, ways to move past compulsive and obsessive thoughts.  Here are a few to try:  Acknowledge the thought.  Let it happen.  Why were you thinking that?  Why can't you stop thinking that?  As you meditate you will learn become somewhat of a mechanic with your own brain. There is value in wondering why you think the things you think when you are sitting and isolated, but if you are compulsively turning a thought over and over in your mind you'll probably need another technique.  Like focusing on your breath, a mantra, visualization, etc.  One technique I've found particularly useful is to focus on the negative space between thoughts and make it larger.  If you think the two thoughts:  ""my leg itches"" and ""god my cat is cute"" there is a very small space of nothingness between those two thoughts.  Make that gap larger and larger.  

""When I meditate I feel like I need to....""  sneeze, scratch my scrotum, fart, .... Sitting for a long time it is amazing the bodily needs that suddenly crop up.  There are two very distinct schools of thought on this.  Some people believe you just need to tough it out.  These impulses are the restlessness of the mind manifesting in the body and trying to get you to break your focus.  I advocate the other school of that which is to simply scratch your nose and pick up where you left off.  Yes, it does detract from the experience of meditating to squirm and if you can't make it five minutes without scratching an itch or coughing maybe you should try enduring it.  But a comfortable body does help the mind focus.

""how should I sit?"" The best answer I have is however is comfortable, that keeps your spine straight and allows you to breath deeply.  Keep experimenting.  I sit half lotus with my hands softly cupped in my lap with my thumbs lightly touching with my tush elevated on a folded up towel, and my chin slightly tucked in.  Maybe that will work for you.  Maybe not.  Beginners often lack the leg flexibility for half lotus and favor sitting cross legged.  This works for awhile but it is much more difficult to sit with a straight back outside of half or full lotus.   One of the greatest ways to decrease discomfort while meditating is by improving strength and flexibility.

""Woah I saw the northern lights riding Hunter Thompson and felt warm inside like lasagna.""  Yes.  While meditating you will experience really strange things sometimes.  The experiences are usually interesting, often moving, sometimes blissful, and sometimes horrific. Some people will tell you to analyze the shit out of these and think that they are deeply symbolic and path to enlightenment... I will not give that advice, I don't mean to step on toes here but I am a firm believer in the weird experiences your brain makes for you while in deep meditation are every bit as much of a distraction as the itch on your nose.  Acknowledge it happened, go ahead and say ""woah,"" but move on with your practice.  The deep mind can offer some thrilling spectacles, but the benefits of meditation come from the silence not the noise.

""Enlightenment.""  Forget about it.  Even if you want ""enlightenment"" from meditating do not even think the damn word.  It just infects your practice and you think every blissful moment has some much greater meaning than it does.  I cringe whenever people talk about the subject and certainly as someone just starting into meditation focus on sitting and breathing, not some obscure spiritual goal.  

""Can I meditate while I...""  Yes.  You can meditate while you do just about anything (except sleep, but even then some people do that weird thing where they inception meditate in their dreams).  Are you going to get the same benefit from meditation if you do it while running as you do when you sit?  I would say no.  To really benefit from meditation you need to quiet your mind as much as possible, this means no running, no doing the dishes, no playing tribes.  But, by all means, experiment with being ""in the moment"" in your day to day life.  The greatest pleasure from meditation is how mundane routine can suddenly become pleasurable and rich.  

""will meditation give me superpowers?""  No.  There is a lot of misinformation out there about the benefits of meditation, but there are also some sound studies that suggest meditators are more emotionally adept, have great focus, stay calmer, have a decreased chance of a few diseases....  Most people who meditate and have meditated for a long period of time do it because it is an enjoyable experience.  Try it out.  Stick with it through the first few weeks or months where your legs cramp and your brain feels awkward.  I think you'll conclude the same.


I'm happy to answer any questions.

When I meditate, my mind often wanders. Then, I realize it's wandering, and get discouraged, thinking that I'm no good at staying in the present moment.

However, my friend told me that every time you realize you aren't being present, you are now being present. In other words, when you realize your mind is wandering, that is a chance to come back to the present moment.

So now, when I realize my mind has been wandering, I no longer criticize myself or get discouraged. Instead, I feel grateful that I have another opportunity to come into the present.

I hope that somebody else can benefit from it. 

Not identifying with negative thoughts: 
 
 
You have to start by separating your TRUE SELF from your thoughts and your feelings.  Your psyche is constructed of 3 entities:   the first is the animal side, which acts on a subconscious level.  Acting on a subconscious level means that you don’t actively think about what you’re doing, you simply do.  For example, you don’t think about breathing, you just breathe.  So the animal side of yourself (called the “Id” in psychology) carries out your normal functions like eating, sleeping, and seeking comfort.  You are hard-wired to do these things, which do not require active thought. 
 
The second entity in your psyche is the thinker.  The “thinker” is the side of your psyche which creates thoughts. In psychology it’s called the “ego”.  The purpose of the ego is to give your sense of self a form… it creates the person you think you are.  If you think about the question “who am I?”, you’re going to think of yourself in terms of the world.  I am a parent, I am an employee, I am a fighter, I am an American, I am tall, I am active, I am extroverted, I am this, I am that.   It is also the side of yourself that has tendencies, vices, addictions. It sets patterns for your life according to what you think you want to do. It essentially creates a persona for yourself.  It takes those labels that you want to identify with, and adds them to the persona that you created for yourself. 
It says, “I am an (accountant)” and those thoughts of you BEING that label makes you act like you are the label.  Since you tie the term “accountant” to your identity, then your subconscious Id starts behaving accordingly. Accountants don’t wear pink hair, so you don’t wear pink hair.  Remember the phrase “you are who you say you are”?  This is true on many levels, and is the mechanism through which your ego creates that persona.  
 
The third entity is called “your true or higher self”.  Your true self is who you really are.  In other words, all of the labels that your ego applies to your self are gone.  They do not exist in relation to your true self.   Your true self is the side of yourself that powers the other two.  Your ego and id act according to what your true self wants.  Whenever you say, “I’m having a crappy day but I’m going to look at the positive side of it”,  this is your true self realizing that your ego is being negative, and it’s turning around according to what it wants (to look for positive aspects).   Your true self is also the entity which is attuned to your spiritual side.  Furthermore, your true self does not have thoughts.  It simply observes, and acts according to your inner nature.  Everybody is born with a hard-wired set of morals.  Across all races and religions we observe things like “murder is wrong” and “stealing is wrong”.  It is your higher self which motivates you to act in accordance to those morals. 
 
Just remember that the ego is the entity which applies WORDS and LABELS to everything around you. It also applies JUDGMENTS.  In other words, when you say you are having a “bad day”, it’s your ego judging it as bad.  A day is a day like any other, it is neither good nor bad. It’s your ego’s negative judgment that makes it good or bad.  This concept applies universally to all things that surround you.  Your ego makes things good or bad. Your ego predisposes you to your moods, and it tells your mind and your body how to digest the things that happen to you.  
 
Now, going back to the initial topic. 98% of the population behaves in accordance to the ego.  In other words, the ego is in the driver’s seat, not your true self.  As a matter of fact, there is a huge power struggle between the ego and the true self.  The ego wants power, it wants to be in control.  It gains control through your thoughts and judgments.  It subconsciously makes judgments on your behalf.  It predisposes you to act in accordance to its will, and makes you live out your life according to the persona it created.  
 
Almost every religion in the world… the three monotheistic relgions, Buddhism, Hinduism, ancient indigenous religions, new age spirituality, even secular humanism… all of these have one thing in common, have one unified goal.  This goal is essentially to discover your true self by transcending the ego.  To transcend literally means “to go through, rise above, to exceed, or go beyond”  For example, the teachings of Christ encourage us to love others as we love ourselves, and to transcend our egoic need to sin. In Eastern religions, people are guided to transcend the ego through meditation.  
 
Everybody has an innate need to discover themselves as part of the universe.  As in, who am I and what am I doing here? What is the purpose and meaning of life?  All of these questions boil down to one, single foundation and goal:    To transcend the power of the ego (and to strip away the personas that it has created), in order to discover your TRUE nature and self.  When you discover your true self, you also discover your place in the universe.  You cannot discover your true self without transcending the ego.  When you transcend the ego, you empower your true self, and take that power away from the ego.  Our purpose is to dominate it, and align it with the intentions of our higher self.  
 
So we come back to the first part:  how to separate yourself from your thoughts and feelings.  This involves separating your higher self from your ego.  The Power of Now is a great guide on how to do this.  But we can boil it down through these steps: 
1.       Start by being in the present moment. Don’t think about the past or the future.  You are here now, and now is all that matters.   When you are in the present moment, notice that all of the mind-chatter goes away.  Your mind becomes still, it does not think.   Being in the present moment allows you to distinguish your thoughts.   
2.       Distinguish your thoughts.  Take the first thought that comes to mind: “I have a headache and I’m in a bad mood”.   Your goal is to deconstruct those thoughts, and attribute them to the part of the self that they correspond to.     
a.       I have a headache– this is your body experiencing this
b.      I’m in a bad mood – this is your ego responding to the pain your body is feeling. 
c.       Bad – this is the label that your ego is applying to the present moment. 
3.       When you have a firm grip on distinguishing your thoughts and deconstructing them,  then you have the power to take away the labels that your ego puts on what you are experiencing.  This is what your inner monologue would sound like:   “Ok so my body is feeling pain and my ego is responding negatively. I am manifesting those negative thoughts and causing myself to be in a bad mood. In order to transcend the ego, I will take away the bad mood label.  I will simply allow myself to experience the pain that my body is feeling, without it being good or bad.  I will simply allow it to be, and I will stop my mind from reacting negatively.”   
a.       If you are not experienced, you can’t just read these words and recite them and make them true.  You have to do the hard work of deconstructing your thoughts and getting to your own conclusion.  But the conclusion is always the same:   Allow whatever you’re experiencing to exist without you putting a “good or bad” label to it.   And trust me, this takes conscious effort.    But once you practice it enough, this process becomes automatic, like breathing.  
b.      So about your headache:   It is there.  It is not good, it is not bad.  It’s simply a headache.  Resist the urge to judge it. Recognize that it gives you pain, and feel the pain.  The pain is neither good nor bad.  It’s just pain.  
 
This process of thought deconstruction will show the ego for what it really is – a false sense of self.  Once you are able to strip away this false sense of self, then your true self will emerge.  Your true self will not have any attributes – it is not good nor bad, it has no need other than to be discovered.   Apply this process to every single thought you have.  Deconstruct everything, and notice where the thoughts come from.  Notice the labels you apply to everything, and notice your desires.  
 
Once you notice yourself applying judgment to everything that surrounds you, your psyche no longer has a need to identify with those judgments. They become trivial, something contrived. It’s like being in Disneyworld – when you’re a kid you believe the characters and the castles to be real. But when you’re an adult, you recognize that the characters are employees in costumes, and the castles are just plaster and don’t have real kings and queens.   Whenever you apply judgment to your experience, Disneyland looks “real”.   Once you deconstruct the judgment and realize that it comes from your egoic need believe in fairytales, then you no longer have a need to believe in the fairytales.  That need goes away because you discover your true self – and your true self does not need to believe in stories to deal with reality. Your true self looks for the truth – your ego wants to believe in the fairytales because it can’t cope with reality.  
 
So this is the basic process for “not identifying with negative thoughts”.    Hope you can benefit from it.  
 
One more note I’d like to add:   I noticed that whenever it’s that time of the month, I tend to experience more emotion.  I’ve learned to isolate that part of me which experiences that added emotion, and not to tie those emotions to anything in my life.  In other words, I FEEL like I am depressed or in a bad mood.  It does not actually mean I am depressed, but it just feels like I am.  I have actually witnessed my ego scramble to tie that bad feeling to something – “It must be because I’m bad at doing something, or because I made some sort of mistake, or because my life seems out of place”.   But I have stopped allowing my ego to tie the bad feeling to anything.  I simply recognize “It’s that time of the month, and I’m having a hormonal reaction. I am absolutely fine, and everything is okay”.   
 
If you can learn to listen to your body, recognize when pain affects you, and consciously recognize what effect it’s having on the ego – you’ve done it.  That’s the whole point.  This does not mean that the pain is going to go away, or your mood is going to improve.  It just simply means that you don’t have to agonize over it, you don’t have to let it affect your wellbeing.  You’re okay, and it’s just a thought.

1356873507.0	15o7ip	"On ""confidence"""		346	54	34	"There's a story about Chögyam Trungpa (the Tibetan meditation master who came to America and happily enacted the mythical crazy wisdom guru appropriate for '70s America) who was for whatever reason travelling with Allen Ginsberg, the poet, who was going around reading his poetry. Trungpa noticed that Ginsberg despite his artistic success was kind of miserable on this tour. So he told him: ""I know why you're so unhappy. It's because you don't like your own poems. You don't trust your own mind.""

And there's something you notice with people who are beginning meditation. They naturally have a lot of questions. Some people don't have a lot of questions, or don't see the use in asking them, or whatever. But when people ask about meditation, it can become clear that this ""not trusting one's own mind"" is something that runs deeply. There's some reason to doubt our minds' capacities in a lot of situations, but meditation is just your mind minding itself -- how is it that we can go astray even with this?

I think that even if meditation isn't exactly like any other skill, it's interesting to compare, because I think fundamentally, it's all just about being in the world, and all practices have stuff in common. So if you look at how you approach other skills, it might show you something about how you're approaching meditation.

And here I think there's one particular thing which is so obvious, but so overlooked... It's that you can't fail. Because the ideas of success and failure are illusory. ""Failure"" is basically just the feeling of something turning out in a way that you didn't want. And so you're free to try anything.

This is something that our whole culture is just massively stupid about in a lot of ways. Look at school. Most people hate going to school because it's all just about learning and succeeding. It's pure discouragement. The underlying lesson is ""don't trust your own mind.""

And so a lot of people acquire this basic underlying defeatism, because they'll never be ""as good as"" or ""better than"" or whatever. I'm never going to be a soccer star, so why the hell should I play soccer? I'm never going to write a bestseller, why would I write? I'm never going to give a TED talk, so why should I think?

And look at music. It's a basic social beautiful activity, it's been around since before history, and you can do it exquisitely with nothing but a goddamned boot thumping the ground, but we're literally sending children to prison because they download recordings of pop songs from the internet? We curate our music tastes, get further and further into obscure genres, because our whole basic approach to the thing is consumptive, but we still need to somehow excel.

What's up with all this crap?

Some people say ""you're perfect exactly the way you are, just like everything else,"" and we think it's a cruel joke, or a vacuous cliché. ""You possess the innate wisdom of the radiant Buddha-nature."" Hah, how pompous!

Try asking an non-artistic adult if they can draw a realistic horse. This just *kills* people. It's embarrassing to fail, it's embarrassing to draw an ugly horse, it's embarrassing to not know how a horse looks. This is ""not trusting your own mind."" If you trust your own mind, just find a picture of a horse, and try to make marks on a paper so it looks like the picture. Maybe it will be hard to get it right. So what?!?

I think this is something brothers and sisters often try to help each other with. ""Come on! Don't be a sissy! Just try it!"" There's something in sibling relationships that can come across as mean, but that really is just two people who know they're fundamentally the same, trying to help each other wake up.

So, meditation is always about going back to the basics. So, what's the BASICS of this kind of ""confidence"" that I'm trying to describe? In meditation, you can say it's about confidently just *taking one breath*. Taking one breath as if you trusted your own mind.

What happens when you just breathe? Read that question as a question from one brother to another, a sincere exhortation for you to try something with your body &amp; mind in this world, something which you absolutely *cannot* fail to do, unless you don't trust your own mind. How will you know if you're ""just breathing?"" DON'T ASK! I don't know! You're the only one who can know that. You're the one who's driving. "	t5_2qnc9	True

I was very touched by the earnestness of the child processes that wanted to bring me news of my aching shoulders, the itch on my scalp, how reproduction would hit the spot right about now, and I cried a bit out of sheer gratitude for these child processes all competing with one another bringing me information I might need to know.  I'm lucky to have them.  I was like, I don't need to do anything with the information at the moment, but I really appreciate you letting me know.  It was the first time I've ever tried that.   Usually I'm staring at them impassively or batting them down as a barrier to a ""good"" sit.   After a long time of appreciating the intricate details and sheer volume of reports I (the parent process?) was getting from them, they got quiet enough where I/it was wondering what would come next.  For a moment, I was aware of a grandparent process watching and appreciating the parent process for being such a kind parent, but I kind of grasped on to how cool that was and it vanished.  That was 8 hours ago and I'm still crying every so often over the wealth of information coming at me.

Spinkler	303	43	134	"Reading along, I'm up to chapter 3, titled ""What Meditation Is"". I'm reading it very very carefully and taking it all in and then I came across the following passage:

&gt;Our human perceptual habits are remarkably stupid in some ways. We tune out 99% of all the sensory stimuli we actually receive, and we solidify the remainder into discrete mental objects. Then we react to those mental objects in programmed habitual ways. An example: There you are, sitting alone in the stillness of a peaceful night. A dog barks in the distance. The perception itself is indescribably beautiful if you bother to examine it. Up out of that sea of silence come surging waves of sonic vibration. You start to hear the lovely complex patterns, and they are turned into scintillating electronic stimulations within the nervous system. The process is beautiful and fulfilling in itself. We humans tend to ignore it totally. Instead, we solidify that perception into a mental object. We paste a mental picture on it and we launch into a series of emotional and conceptual reactions to it. ""There is that dog again. He is always barking at night. What a nuisance. Every night he is a real bother. Somebody should do something. Maybe I should call a cop. No, a dog catcher. So, I'll call the pound. No, maybe I'll just write a real nasty letter to the guy who owns that dog. No, too much trouble. I'll just get an ear plug."" They are just perceptual and mental habits. You learn to respond this way as a child by copying the perceptual habits of those around you. These perceptual responses are not inherent in the structure of the nervous system. The circuits are there. But this is not the only way that our mental machinery can be used. That which has been learned can be unlearned. The first step is to realize what you are doing, as you are doing it, and stand back and quietly watch.

This caused me to close my eyes and let the music I was listening to wash over me and with some new found clarity I experienced one of the most beautiful experiences. I felt my new found knowledge dissolving barriers that have been in place for thirty years and experienced this gorgeous music with freshly opened eyes.

I can decimate a big bag in like 15 minutes. But I’ve been trying to get in shape, so I made the hard decision to turn down my beautiful fruit-flavored babies. Then I had an idea:


**I would eat exactly one jellybean a day, mindfully.**


Normally, I stuff them into my face like a starving person, often while reading a comic book or something. Now, instead, I take a few minutes to savor a single bean, giving it my full attention. I get more enjoyment from that one bean than I used to from the whole bag.


Every day after breakfast, I pull a jellybean randomly from the bag and see what today’s flavor is going to be. Then I take my time and experience the bean through all of my senses:


* I look it over and take in all the minute visual details. There’s actually a ton to see. The bean isn’t perfectly rounded — it’s got planes and irregularities. The surface usually has small dings from being knocked around a bag with other jellybeans. Without too much inner monologue, I note the color of the bean and any visual pattern. If there are speckles, are they small and neat, or splotchy? Are they evenly spread out, or clumped into patches? Is the bean opaque, or jewel-like and translucent? I hold it up to the sunlight for a second — what does that look like? It’s actually pretty enthralling when you start looking this closely, seeing all the details you’d never even thought to look for before.


* I feel the bean between my fingers. Is it cool? Is it hard or a little yielding? Is it leaving a residue on my fingers?


* I smell the bean. What’s that like? Does it just smell sweet, or can I actually smell the specific flavor?


* Eventually, I pop the bean into my mouth, but I don’t bite down right away. First, I take a few seconds to feel what the bean is like on my tongue. I knock it around my mouth and hear it clack against my teeth. I notice the surface of the bean getting rough and sandpapery as my saliva dissolves the candy coating. Then I bite down and pay attention to the gush of flavor that washes over my tongue. (That part is awesome.) As I chew, I feel my jaw working, hear the chewing sounds, and also watch the flavor sort of evolve and intensify, hit a peak, then start fading into aftertaste. It’s a surprisingly epic ride.


And that's my Jelly Belly meditation. It’s fun, easy, and maybe less daunting than sitting meditation, but it definitely is a meditative practice. For me, it's a nice supplement to sitting and a sorta lighthearted way to bring more mindfulness into my daily routine.

(Jon Kabat-Zinn teaches a similar exercise with a raisin. I find it more fun with jellybeans, plus you get some variety in.)

I've never, never seen it so clearly. But it doesn't matter a bit if you don't understand, because each one of you is quite perfect as you are, even if you don't know it. Life is basically a gesture, but no one, no thing, is making it. There is no necessity for it to happen, and none for it to go on happening. For it isn't being driven by anything; it just happens freely of itself. It's a gesture of motion, of sound, of color, and just as no one is making it, it isn't happening to anyone. There is simply no problem of life; it is completely purposeless play - exuberance which is its own end. Basically there is the gesture. Time, space, and multiplicity are complications of it. There is no reason whatever to explain it, for explanations are just another form of complexity, a new manifestation of life on top of life, of gestures gesturing. Pain and suffering are simply extreme forms of play, and there isn't anything in the whole universe to be afraid of because it doesn't happen to anyone! There isn't any substantial ego at all. The ego is a kind of flip, a knowing of knowing, a fearing of fearing. It's a curlicue, an extra jazz to experience, a sort of double-take or reverberation, a dithering of consciousness which is the same as anxiety."" - Alan Watts

Words can not explain how beautiful it is to experience this thought.  I say experience deliberately, for it is very different to think the words and experience the expression behind them.  

Many people will see a huge chunk of text and skip it.  Some will read it and pass it off as another phony inspirational quote.  A few of you will be touched as deeply as I have been by it.  That is perfect, for if it wasn't that way, it wouldn't be at all.

1375847249.0	1juzz2	Epiphany while meditating	8rysh	246	29	51	"I've recently switched from 15-20 minute sessions to 30 minute sessions. Yesterday during my sit, I had a sudden and profound epiphany about my biggest mental weakness: rumination. Most of what I will write is probably quite obvious, but part of what I realized yesterday is that there is a very serious distinction between knowing something and understanding it. 

**Rumination** - 1. : to go over in the mind repeatedly and often casually or slowly

I can only speak for myself, but my mind is constantly ruminating on one thing or another. As an introvert and a self-considered ""logical"" person, I've largely mistaken this ruminating for analyzing. It is not analyzing. Almost all of my time spent chewing on any given subject is simply repeating conclusions that I've already come to rather than learning anything new. 

Throughout the day, I'll ruminate on dozens of things of various significance. However, I have a handful of thought patterns that I will consistently re-visit on that have greatly affected my self-esteem and the way I feel about myself in general. The longer I let my mind repeat them, the farther from reality I get and the worse I feel. And because my mind is in a state of disarray, I will often get deep into these ruminations without even realizing I'm doing it.

A good example of a recurring rumination of mine is self-improvement. I'll think of all the ways I could be, *should be*, bettering myself. I'll recall all of my past opportunities to improve and I'll criticize myself for failing to so. I'll make plans to do better. *But none of this is helping.* I already know what I need to do. I'll either do it or I won't. Thinking about it over and over will not change the final outcome in a positive way. In fact, it's more likely to hurt. I'll lower my self-esteem by criticizing myself for not being this ideal person I think I should be. And then I'll build up a new ideal which I intend to achieve and which is inevitably completely unrealistic and unreachable.

This thought pattern on self-improvement is only one example of several counter-productive and harmful ruminations I entertain for far too long on a daily basis.

For me, meditation has been a training program for recognizing my mind ruminating quicker and stopping it quicker. It's been a slow and gradual process, but I can confidently say that I have noticed improvement

During the brief windows in which the ruminations stop, I am present. When present, I can appreciate what's actually happening in the world rather than constantly reliving the past and anticipating the future."	t5_2qnc9	True

I started meditating regularly a couple of months ago, and I had a ""break through"" today. Whereas in the past I would have ""given in"" to anxious thoughts / feelings and allowed them to intensify and spiral into debilitating panic, today when I felt an anxiety trigger, I told myself ""That's not me; It's just my ego. It's temporary. I can get through it"" and then I meditated until the feelings went away. Through meditation I've learned to accept that my mind is prone to anxiety and that it's something I'm always going to have to deal with --whereas in the past I was always hoping I'd find a ""cure"" that would make it go away and never return. I've also started to hear/feel the difference between my ego, my more ""present"" mind, and general mental chatter. They feel different in a basic, physical sense: It feels like my ego comes from my throat / chest area, the chatter is on the periphery, around my skull, and my ""present"" mind is softer, and comes from the center of my mind.

""The Voyage by Dada on August 31, 2011

I lived in the Philippines for approximately ten years. The Philippines is a country with many islands and the only way to get from one island to another is by ship which may take from 6 hours to 3 days. I was traveling on one such ship from Manila the capitol to another island, perhaps Negros.

In the evening after everyone had dinner, I was resting in my bunk bed on a ship carrying almost a thousand other people. It wasn’t a luxury ship. It was just a simple passenger liner. I was dressed in my saffron sannyasi uniform.

Sauntering through the maze of bunk beds, the captain of the ship was looking for something interesting to do. Quite frankly riding on a ship for 24 or 36 hours can be quite boring unless there is an occasional fish jumping out of the water or perhaps a rough sea.

So the captain was looking for some entertainment in the form of a conversation. Seeing me, lying on the bunk bed, he wandered over and asked me who I was and why I was dressed in saffron. He then invited me to the bridge where he and his men guide the ship through the sea to its destination. So I agreed. I was curious after all.

When we arrived on the bridge, I was struck by the silence. In the passenger area, there is a continuous noise coming from the engines. Here there was complete silence. The full moon was beautifully reflected on the sea water which was like glass. It was an awesome site.

I asked the captain what he would do if there were to be a typhoon. He replied that he would be advised ahead of time and would head for a safe port. Still curious I enquired further. I asked, “What if you had no time to reach the port or were not informed in time?” He then said that the important thing to remember is to keep the propeller running. If the propeller which moves the ship through the waves were to stop, then the ship would be at the mercy of the waves.

I suddenly realized that meditation and life is similar to his description. Sometimes meditation is like a calm sea with a beautiful reflection of Divinity on my mind. At other times my mind is like a typhoon of emotions and thoughts. It is important in the rough sea of emotions to keep the mantra running as the mantra is the propeller that moves me toward intimacy with the Divine and prevents me from becoming overwhelmed with my emotional challenges.

It is truly amazing that my Guru teaches me through the most ordinary events of life and they make deep impressions on my mind. I have never forgotten this experience even though it happened years ago."""	t5_2qnc9	True

There were daily Dhamma talks given by the center's head monk and sometimes there were gems of wisdom that really spoke to me.  One day the topic of discussion was the difference between acting and observing internal states.  It was within this context that the Dhamma instructor dropped this knowledge bomb:

&gt; Anything you can observe is not you.

From external objects, like clothes and computers, to internal emotions experienced throughout the day and spontaneously arising thoughts that occur during meditative practice; if it is observable, if I can experience it, then it is a transient object separate from myself.  This naturally leads to the question of ""what is myself"" which is something I can't really answer within this framework.  Nonetheless, if I'm having an especially difficult time maintaining mindfulness, I've found this idea to be very helpful and I thought others on r/meditation might find it helpful too.

I haven't cried in years. I've always felt like I've had to work my ass off. I've been waking up super early just to get everything done.

I don't really buy into the monk stuff or the spiritual enlightenment stuff. I was just wondering if anyone else here simply meditates to practice mindfulness, because it simply makes them happy?

I just want to know there are other people meditating out there who aren't on some new age spiritual journey, but just who meditate for their mental health (whether it be stress, etc. or just memory, focusing, etc.). Because I feel like I'm doing it wrong or in the wrong place when I come here sometimes and see lots of posts about monks and spirituality.

**EDIT:** Sorry this edit must have not posted before. What I'm seeing here is that there are multiple definitions of spirituality. I, because of my religious background, have always associated spirituality with a god. If spirituality simply means cognitive control/mindfulness, then I am definitely meditating for, what some would consider, ""spiritual reasons."" I just don't define it that way.

**TL;DR:** Spirituality is a vague and subjective term.

Although I'm very new to this, meditating has helped me tremendously in school. I'm a college student with a history of procrastination with an all around lack of enthusiasm for my studies (not because it isn't interesting, but because of laziness).

I came onto this subreddit after reading about someone's growth in concentration after meditating. I've subscribed to the mindfulness meditation method. I started out small, around 5 minutes a day, to more. I now typically masturbate about 15 minutes twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. I always try to make my sessions but sometimes time gets the better of me.

My grades have improved dramatically. I've become much more focused during my periods of studying. I have an exam tomorrow, so as I was typing this I felt some anxiety originally. I then later came to the realization that I had finished everything so far ahead of schedule that I didn't have anything else to do (I reviewed this morning as well).

Anyways, sorry for the long text. I just wanted to say thank you to this subreddit for flipping me around! I wonder, how much more can meditation offer me when months turn into years?"	t5_2qnc9	True
1367843371.0	1dse8o	Meditation and my anxiety	sctroyenne	194	20	36	"I started doing mindfulness meditation about six weeks ago on the suggestion of a therapist. I was skeptical of it at first but had some good experiences early on which convinced me that there's something to this and to continue (I also find it funny how random, long-forgotten memories will just pop into my head).

The other day after hitting the snooze button I transitioned into meditation. I was feeling pretty blissful and enjoying it when I suddenly heard my mother stirring in the other room. I immediately started feeling all kinds of stress symptoms but I managed to hold my concentration and just sort of ""watched"" the effect it had on my body. It felt so great afterwards to become so much more aware of the effect stress has on my body (I normally feel so cut off from myself) and to be able to identify my mother as a source of stress (it's not a dysfunctional relationship but I think there are some issues).

I've just had another session during my lunch break at my graveyard shift at work, sitting all alone in the basement. At one point I thought I heard footsteps which kind of freaked me out. Once again, I maintained my focus even while I was trying to determine if what I was hearing was approaching danger or not and I was able to ""watch"" the immediate panic reaction as it moved down my body, ending in a pain in my stomach which slowly faded away. My physical response seemed more acute than how it would have felt normally, but I'm so grateful for having experienced it because I'm learning how my body reacts to stress and fear.

I almost feel like anymore the most upvoted stuff is a competition to see who has the weirdest sensations during meditation. I, too, have had some strange sensations, but I understand that the human brain in fascinating and you're tapping into a different part of it while meditating. I feel like a lot of it should be covered by a basic knowledge of meditation. I'm all for trying to help people out, but it's getting a little ridiculous imo. I would love to see more news articles or meditation tracks appear on my front page. Less of ""this is happening"" or ""this type of meditation isn't working."" I mean, not all types of meditation work for everyone. I, for example, hate body awareness meditation. It always just makes me super aware that I itch somewhere and ruins the vibe. That doesn't mean that I come on here and rant about how upset I am that it isn't working, I just tried other things like grounding meditation or whatever else. 

I'm in a bad mood. I would just like to see more of a change to an intellectual subreddit. I apologize if I am out of line. Either way it felt nice to get it off my chest. 

*EDIT: Wow, this generated a lot more discussion than I thought it would! (To be honest I thought I would get chastised and then ignored). I do have a few things to say in the midst of all of this discussion. 

I thank everyone for their replies. It is interesting to see how everyone has reacted to my rant. Some negative, some positive. I've learned many things from all of you and your feelings toward my post. I will say that I am much less grumpy today. The frustration of yesterday had only a little to do with the decline in content that I like on this subreddit. Despite that I thought it was an issue to needed to be addressed. I still do: and now it has been. I am loving reading everyone's opinions regardless of whether they are bashing me, going further than I would go in anger, in the middle, or just telling me to take a chill pill.

I have gotten the ""be the change you want to see in the world"" sort of response from a few of you. Know that I fully expected to see this kind of response; however, I also intend on taking said advice. I will try to find and post more of what I find interesting on this subreddit. I alone will not be enough to sort of ""fix"" the general discussions, but I hope that I can inspire or push others of you to do the same, or at least generate enough of an interest in them or whatever. 

I have thought and changed my mind about a few things. I originally thought that the experience stories should go to another subreddit. I thought this hypocritical at first. I am in many subreddits where this sort of split has happened and failed, or made the two sides very hostil. I have since adjusted my view. I do think that it is important for this to be a supportive community. I now think that perhaps there should be a thread once every week to two weeks that is just a discussion of the different experiences everyone wants to share. This way the questions won't be re asked nearly on a daily basis, it will fill up a lot less of the pages with the same thing, and there will be no need for a section of the community to be ousted. I'm not sure what others will think of this idea, maybe it is still a bad idea. 

I thank everyone for reading my post and replies, which will continue. I also thank those of you who listened to my rant as just that: a rant. I really needed to get it off my chest. It was a small issue in my life. It's nothing that I was losing sleep over or anything, but it was great to see people who were supportive of me just pouring out my bitching, relevant or not. 

I am loving this, I feel like it's a discussion that has been needed on this thread for some time. I hope that I have not caused too much discourse on such a peaceful place. Anyways, I'm going to stop typing and go back to reading all of the discussion and feedback. "	t5_2qnc9	True

He asked his teacher, ""Why most people's mind is restless, and only a few possess a calm mind? What can one do to still the mind?""
The teacher looked at the disciple, smiled and said, ""I will tell you a story.""

An elephant was standing and picking leaves from a tree. A small fly came, flying and buzzing near his ear.
The elephant waved it away with his long ears. Then the fly came again, and the elephant waved it away once more.
This was repeated several times. Then the elephant asked the fly, ""Why are you so restless and noisy? Why can't you stay for a while in one place?""
The fly answered: ""I am attracted to whatever I see, hear or smell. My five senses pull me constantly in all directions and I cannot resist them. What is your secret? How can you stay so calm and still?""
The elephant stopped eating and said, ""My five senses do not rule my attention. Whatever I do, I get immersed in it. Now that I am eating, I am completely immersed in eating. In this way I can enjoy my food and chew it better. I rule and control my attention, and not the other way around.""

Upon hearing these words, the disciple's eyes opened wide and a smile appeared on his face. He looked at his teacher and said, ""I understand! The mind is restless and goes wherever the attention is. Control your attention, and you control your mind and the senses.""

""Yes, that's right"", answered the teacher, ""Any occurrence requiring undivided attention will be accompanied by a compelling distraction. The
mind is powerful but restless; restless senses forcibly carry it away. Trying to control/restrain it is difficult but can be trained by practice
of attention. By giving full attention to one thing at a time (to your intense noble interest, passion or curiosity), we can learn to direct our
attention where we choose. And whatever we put our FULL attention to, will grow stronger in our life.""*

*A person's accomplishments in life are the cumulative effect of her/his attention and corresponding efforts. One principle reason why people so often found themselves not so useful is that they divide and shift their attention among a multiplicity of trivial objects and pursuits. Life is denied by lack of attention and one learns something every day if she / he pays full attention to become more productive/useful. The moment one gives close attention to any thing, even a blade of grass it becomes a mysterious, magnificent world in itself inviting for infinite learning.

There is a physical sensation that goes with this urge to open your eyes and uncross your legs.  Observe the hell out of it.  Where do you feel it? What does it feeling like? How strong is it? This isn't particularly pleasant but just disidentify from the feeling by watching it and soon it will dissipate and you can go back to focusing on whatever your meditation object may be.

Then it occurred to me one day, that I was attached to them.

At some point, I made a declaration that they defined who I was.

But then I remembered back to the times before the anxieties.

If there was a ""before"", then that means I learned these fears.

Which means I can unlearn them.

I started writing about my fears. It was **integral** for me overcoming them.

Step 1: Write down your fears. Let everything out. You are the only one thats going to read it, so don't hold anything back. *Really* let go.

After you've written, come back to it a day later. And look at what you wrote as if it was someone else writing it. Look at your anxious thoughts while you are feeling relaxed, and you will approach your irrational fears in a more rational way. You will find yourself coming up with logical challenges to your anxious thoughts, and you end up exposing them as baseless and/or blown waaay out of porportion.  I've found myself laughing sometimes at some of my thoughts.

Step 2: Meditate deeply after writing and come to that place of infinite peace.  I remind myself as I am in this peace, that this is my true self.  It was there before my fears, during them, and will be there after I get over them.  

Realizing that this place of peace was always with me, realizing that I was attached to my fears, in addition to investigating my fears from different angles via writing, is how I got my life back.

I may still have a few remnant anxious thoughts from time to time, but when they arise, I am mindful of them.  I observe them, do [square breathing](http://dharmaineverywave.com/square-breathing/), and I remind myself ""These are your attachments"".  This is incredibly important to realize.

As time went on, I stopped thinking of them as fears, and more as attachments.  Then after a while, you stop thinking of them at all.  And thats when you have detached fully.

I hope this helps any of you with fears and anxieties."	t5_2qnc9	True

Just being with her makes you feel euphoric and you always want to be with her. This is similar to when you first learn meditation. You are amazed by the relaxation and calm you feel that you have most likely never experienced. You can't wait to meditate when you wake up and then in the late afternoon. It's a natural high and you love it. Once a relationship becomes more serious and you and your girl start having to learn how to live with eachother things can slow down, the lust is gone and it turns deeper. You don't have the urge to be with her constantly, but you know that in order for things to work out you need to put in effort as a couple to really start loving each other. At this point in a relationship things are more amazing then the first stage when you just feel madly in love. You work together as a team and really start making moves in this world. Back to meditation, about 3-4 months in, the natural high effect that you started off feeling goes away. The 20 minutes twice a day starts feeling tedious with little reward, and you make excuses to skip one here and there. This is the most crucial time to keep diligent for this is where you commit to meditation and live Bliss or you give up and go back to living your old life. A year in, you find yourself living in a way where your not thinking negative thoughts or really any thoughts, your fully engrossed in life and finally being.

They lost control and hit my rear left. I fish tailed. Sure during the incident I was a little flustered but it didn't affect me very much at all. my dad was more pissed than I was. It was an accident. they lost control.


It was interesting because I noticed that my body didn't get physically angry or upset. It was calm. I think this is due to my understanding of mental/emotional/state awareness. Things I've learned from meditation. If I didn't know these things I'm sure I would have been really upset, pissed, and my day would have been ruined but I wasn't and it was a very empowering feeling. I was in control. My higher self was in control, not my primal instincts. My dad was flipping out. cussing etc but I was cool as a cucumber. I was aware of the situation at a higher level. my dad and I were polar opposites. 


That's the best way I could describe it. 

keep calm and chive on.

1361710038.0	194pm0	"Meditation, ""not-thinking"" and speed-reading."	Pakislav	176	24	71	"The user ManiacApple have presented an interesting question in r/buddhism. A confused question that I couldn't find an answer to. It seemed so obvious and at the same time I couldn't articulate it. 

Can we really ""not think""? Obviously, that's the point of meditation, right? But what does it mean to ""not think""? **We can't not think**, can we? Can we walk, see, feel, speak if we are not thinking? Can we understand when we are not thinking? But that's the point of meditation, to understand and to ""not think"". How is that possible?

What is a thought? I don't know... That's what I was concentrating on not doing during meditation... But what was I doing during meditation? I was trying to repress my inner monologue, my imagination. But that's not thinking, is it? That's just it, an inner monologue, a speech. That is a... *formalised thought*.

And suddenly I understood it whole. That inner voice that we so often call a ""thought"" isn't a thought at all! That inner voice speaks when we read, and we are not thinking when we read, do we? We just read, absorb information, not create it. 

That's it! I know now what a *thought* is. The thinking, is a subconcious process so fast we have to formalise it in a form of inner voice, outloud speech or imagination in order for our conciousness to keep up! We all have such vast and poweful cognitive power, but we don't controll it! We slow it down by formalising it into words and images, to give a form to allow our conciousness to understand it, but we don't have to do that, and that's the point of meditation: To *open* our minds to the world, our subconcious minds. The conciousness, the ego, the inner voice and imagination: *That's only a formalised interface*. We need it only to communicate our thoughts, but we get confused and we think this is who we are, but that's so much not true! Our real being is enlightened with incredible comprehension of the world! We just have to meditate and forego that interface that slows us down!

Speed reading is exactly that! From young age we are taught to vocalise each letter inside our heads! But if we let go of that inner voice and just absorb the words without these so called ""thoughts"", we can read entire pages of text in miliseconds, and read books as fast as we can move pages! And we *all* can do it!

That's the point of meditation, to open our minds directly to the world, without the extra steps of this formalised interface of imagination and inner voice. The technic is the same as it is in speed reading. We are tought to read a word, understand it, then speak it, then hear it and *then* process it in our minds again, while we can simply stop on the very first step! The same is with thinking. If we are able to shut our inner voice, our imagination and our ego, we can obtain our raw, vast and powerfull cognitive power and understand everything fully, completly and instantenously - *That* is enlightenment.

**Edit:** Everyone. Please do **note** that I **did not** say that we can/should *not think*. In fact, I stated that we *can not* **not think**, which I will now underline above."	t5_2qnc9	True

let it enfold you 

when I was a young man 
I felt these things were 
dumb, unsophisticated. 
I had bad blood, a twisted 
mind, a precarious 
upbringing. 

I was hard as granite, I 
leered at the 
sun. 
I trusted no man and 
especially no 
woman. 

I was living a hell in 
small rooms, I broke 
things, smashed things, 
walked through glass, 
cursed. 
I challenged everything, 
was continually being 
evicted, jailed,in and 
out of fights, in and out 
of my mind. 
women were something 
to screw and rail 
at, I had no male 
freinds, 

I changed jobs and 
cities, I hated holidays, 
babies, history, 
newspapers, museums, 
grandmothers, 
marriage, movies, 
spiders, garbagemen, 
english accents,spain, 
france,italy,walnuts and 
the color 
orange. 
algebra angred me, 
opera sickened me, 
charlie chaplin was a 
fake 
and flowers were for 
pansies. 

peace an happiness to me 
were signs of 
inferiority, 
tenants of the weak 
an 
addled 
mind. 

but as I went on with 
my alley fights, 
my suicidal years, 
my passage through 
any number of 
women-it gradually 
began to occur to 
me 
that I wasn't different 

from the 
others, I was the same, 

they were all fulsome 
with hatred, 
glossed over with petty 
greivances, 
the men I fought in 
alleys had hearts of stone. 
everybody was nudging, 
inching, cheating for 
some insignificant 
advantage, 
the lie was the 
weapon and the 
plot was 
empty, 
darkness was the 
dictator. 

cautiously, I allowed 
myself to feel good 
at times. 
I found moments of 
peace in cheap 
rooms 
just staring at the 
knobs of some 
dresser 
or listening to the 
rain in the 
dark. 
the less I needed 
the better I 
felt. 

maybe the other life had worn me 
down. 
I no longer found 
glamour 
in topping somebody 
in conversation. 
or in mounting the 
body of some poor 
drunken female 
whose life had 
slipped away into 
sorrow. 

I could never accept 
life as it was, 
i could never gobble 
down all its 
poisons 
but there were parts, 
tenous magic parts 
open for the 
asking. 

I re formulated 
I don't know when, 
date, time, all 
that 
but the change 
occured. 
something in me 
relaxed, smoothed 
out. 
i no longer had to 
prove that I was a 
man, 

I did'nt have to prove 
anything. 

I began to see things: 
coffee cups lined up 
behind a counter in a 
cafe. 
or a dog walking along 
a sidewalk. 
or the way the mouse 
on my dresser top 
stopped there 
with its body, 
its ears, 
its nose, 
it was fixed, 
a bit of life 
caught within itself 
and its eyes looked 
at me 
and they were 
beautiful. 
then- it was 
gone. 

I began to feel good, 
I began to feel good 
in the worst situations 
and there were plenty 
of those. 
like say, the boss 
behind his desk, 
he is going to have 
to fire me. 

I've missed too many 
days. 
he is dressed in a 
suit, necktie, glasses, 
he says, 'I am going 
to have to let you go' 

'it's all right' I tell 
him. 

He must do what he 
must do, he has a 
wife, a house, children. 
expenses, most probably 
a girlfreind. 

I am sorry for him 
he is caught. 

I walk onto the blazing 
sunshine. 
the whole day is 
mine 
temporailiy, 
anyhow. 

(the whole world is at the 
throat of the world, 
everybody feels angry, 
short-changed, cheated, 
everybody is despondent, 
dissillusioned) 

I welcomed shots of 
peace, tattered shards of 
happiness. 

I embraced that stuff 
like the hottest number, 
like high heels, breasts, 
singing,the 
works. 

(dont get me wrong, 
there is such a thing as cockeyed optimism 
that overlooks all 
basic problems just for 
the sake of 
itself- 
this is a shield and a 
sickness.) 

The knife got near my 
throat again, 
I almost turned on the 
gas 
again 
but when the good 
moments arrived 
again 
I did'nt fight them off 
like an alley 
adversary. 
I let them take me, 
i luxuriated in them, 
I bade them welcome 
home. 
I even looked into 
the mirror 
once having thought 
myself to be 
ugly, 
I now liked what 
I saw,almost 
handsome, yes, 
a bit ripped and 
ragged, 
scares, lumps, 
odd turns, 
but all in all, 
not too bad, 
almost handsome, 
better at least than 
some of those movie 
star faces 
like the cheeks of 
a baby's 
butt. 

and finally I discovered 
real feelings of 
others, 
unheralded, 
like lately, 
like this morning, 
as I was leaving, 
for the track, 
i saw my wife in bed, 
just the 
shape of 
her head there 
(not forgetting 
centuries of the living 
and the dead and 
the dying, 
the pyramids, 
Mozart dead 
but his music still 
there in the 
room, weeds growing, 
the earth turning, 
the toteboard waiting for 
me) 
I saw the shape of my 
wife's head, 
she so still, 
I ached for her life, 
just being there 
under the 
covers. 

I kissed her in the, 
forehead, 
got down the stairway, 
got outside, 
got into my marvelous 
car, 
fixed the seatbelt, 
backed out the 
drive. 
feeling warm to 
the fingertips, 
down to my 
foot on the gas 
pedal, 
I entered the world 
once 
more, 
drove down the 
hill 
past the houses 
full and empty 
of 
people, 
I saw the mailman, 
honked, 
he waved 
back 
at me. "	t5_2qnc9	True

The issue here is people expect to meditate perfectly, i.e. keep their attention on their object of focus without fail. The issues here is this will not be the case. Perfection is a realtive concept, sensation will come up and thoughts will too, you won't kill them, you won't stop them, the only thing you can do is let them go when they arise. 

I heard someone say meditators beat themselves up when they lose their mindfulness, they get sucked into a thought or a stream and feel bad that this happened.

I'd like to start this post with a disclaimer. I *know* that meditation is not a self help technique and in the traditional sense the whole idea is not to expect or work at anything. **I completely understand that meditation is about just being.** What I wonder though, is can it be used to help with self defeating behaviors? I'm not talking about doing away with bad habits such as nail-biting or anything like that and I am in no way trying to reduce meditation down to some ""mental fix."" It's so much more than that both, historically, and to me personally.  

Recently, I've had several run-ins with self-sabotage. By this I mean doing things I know I shouldn't, but for some reason keep doing them anyway. An example of this is drinking(a bit) and then driving myself home. I'm not completely irresponsible about it, but last night I got stopped and had to do all the tests. I blew into the breathalizer and I passed just fine, but I felt shaken by it nonetheless. My life would've come crashing down with a DUI and the saftey of others is very important to me as well.

I know this fact, yet I continue to do it(not that it's on a nightly basis or anything, just from time to time).


In an effort to become more self-aware I've been meditating daily for two months, usually 20min -1 hour sits. I see subtle changes in myself and I'm starting to understand that I don't have to run on ""auto-pilot"" all the time and I was hoping that if I continue to meditate regularly it might lead me to some insights as to ""why I do stupid shit"" so to speak.  I understand from a buddhist standpoint that the root of all suffering is attachment and I shouldn't be attached to any one view of myself, I just really dislike the choices I see myself making at times. 

Honestly I think I understand how it all fits together: we suffer because we're attached and running on autopilot, mindlessly bouncing around at the whims of our egos and automatic habits and by implementing mindfulness we slowly are able to make our own choices.

So I guess in this small rant I've now put you all through what I'm wondering is this: Has meditation helped you do align with who you really are by allowing you to handle situations as you want, instead of automatically?

Also, are there any other types of meditation other than mindfulness I might try that would help me with this?

As always, thanks for listening guys. I truly enjoy this sub.

1357324299.0	15yn9d	Stop saying there is no point to meditation and goals are not appropriate. No one actually believes that. 	88327	209	60	152	"You may say that because it sounds kinda Zen, but if you're a meditator your actions are not consistent with it. It takes discipline to sit every day -- why not do something else? If it's to achieve a blissful, calm state, then that's a reason too. Would you be happy if you never had a different experience than your very first 20 minute session? No, you want to progress in your meditation. 



Every author I've read on the subject traveled and did some kind of intensive meditation practice. Why? For no reason? Merely to live in the present moment? You can do that anywhere, doing anything. They did it to get better at meditation and to have some kind of experience. To train their mind, even if just to train their attention and to cultivate the ability to live in the present more effectively. And usually something more, with a goal of liberating themselves from suffering caused by the mind. 



Obviously that doesn't mean you are sitting down to meditate and saying to yourself, ""OK, I'm going to train my mind today, and if it doesn't work I'm a total failure and I've wasted my time."" That's not what people mean by goals of meditation. 



**TL;DR** Meditation is a method of training the mind. It's not something you do for no reason and it's not bad to have goals as long as they're realistic.

1370161642.0	1fiepd	I can easily say that meditation has changed my perspective on life.	yeahkeogh	163	16	34	"Months back, my anxiety was reaching its peak. I felt like all the problems in my surroundings all fell on top of me, like I was to blame for things I wasn't even part of. In result of this anxiety, my depression was also sky rocketing, about 50% or more of my thought process through out the day was either ""kill yourself"" or something like ""life is pointless, why the fuck am I here"" just very dark, hopeless thoughts.

Along with lots of cannabis, and a few psychedelics here and there like LSD and psylocibin every month, meditation was a huge step in eliminating my negative thoughts on life. At the start of my practice of meditation I didn't have much hope or belief in it, but I didn't stop practicing it, after a while I definitely felt a change in my mood. Its been little over two months of the practice and already my head has gone from a grey, dull trashcan of depression and anxiety to this vast field of colors and positive energy. 

Anxiety really took me away from life, I felt like I was living the future only because I was worried about it, because of this I was losing my grip on reality and for a good 3 or 4 months I felt non existent. Meditation completely cured that part of it, it reeled me back into the present. If my day starts to fade into depression, my first instinct is to just sit down and let it happen. I try to make myself and the depression as contrasting as possible so I can get a real firm understanding on what I'm feeling. As I focus on the sudden growing depression in my day, it starts to not seem like depression but instead just an object of observation. I have no negative feelings towards depression now, when it happens I simply say to myself in my head ""This is depression"" or ""This is anxiety"" and instead of feeling overwhelmingly awful about these grey experiences I feel absolutely normal mentally, and the depression and anxiety I know are just an illness, I am not my illness, so I do not worry about it. 

Aside from eliminating my depression and anxious feelings towards life, the experiences I have during meditation are absolutely astonishing. I'll sit on my bed with my legs crossed, eyelids closed and looking in the top field of my vision, a few slow deep breaths and I'm slowly brought into this calm, peaceful realm. It's as if I am shrunken down to the size of an atom, and placed inside my thoughts. I find myself in this massive landscape, I want to say it is endless but I dare not to make that exploration until I have reached a higher state of mind. Anyway, back to this landscape, which is not much of a landscape at all; but a universe of a higher dimension inhabited by these strange dream-like creatures of this almost liquid electricity. Along with these entities I notice massive geometric patterns beyond human comprehension. I could not explain these patterns if I devoted my life to explaining them. 

After observing this vast comfortable landscape, I find myself moving up these strange stages of existence, time really starts to slow down almost to a halting pace. And as I move further up these stages of existence I am introduced by the pure essence of happiness, just stricken by massive amounts of euphoria. I feel so safe in these stages, and if by some wild turn of events in my physical life my body is injured or destroyed, I feel as if the universe would not let me parish into a sea of black for eternity, I feel as if the universe is trustful enough that I do not need to worry about death, or what comes after, just as long as I have my feet on firm ground and I have a strong grip on the present, as long as I have that, I am safe no matter what. After all these mindful thoughts that rush past my field of view, I feel my body again. and suddenly I am falling through this tunnel of colors in my imagination, and as I'm falling I'm saying goodbye, and thank you. I'm not sure to what, but I just felt the need to. After my farewells I witness this strange indescribable entity pulsing back these waves of green purple and pink, pulses in a morse code pattern. Even as I'm typing out my experience on here it is replaying in my mind, and the same familiar tingle on the center of my forehead I get while meditating. 

I have only had experiences like this twice, the first time was completely spontaneous, I felt this array of colors tingling my forehead, and felt the need to further explore the feeling, I sit down and focus on my forehead and I'm suddenly brought into that colorful state. 

I want to say thank you to all of you on this subreddit for changing my life for the very best. Just some time ago I felt as if my life was coming to an end, now I feel that is completely irrelevant to the present and therefor does not worry me. 

tl;dr - Anxiety swallowed me, started meditating and regained grip on life, experienced some beautiful colorful dreams, I love being alive. "	t5_2qnc9	True

1364613078.0	1ba7yx	Had an experience that could shed some light on depression. I'd like to hear what r/meditation thinks.	thatguy141	173	29	62	"I was having a hot bath and was watching my breath when I realized that my mind was thinking quite cruel and unhelpful thoughts. I realized that I am really hard on myself all the time, and my thoughts are like a relentless stream of emotional baggage. I am thinking about past mistakes, personal expectations that leave me feeling drained and depressed, and even present concerns are framed in a way that causes me stress. Then, I just felt what I was feeling. I felt horrible, sad, hurt. I couldn't believe this is what I was making myself feel like. I was using these thoughts to distract myself from my own feelings, which perpetuated the cycle. So, I just let myself feel. And the thoughts lost their potency. I was no longer identified with my stream of thoughts, but with my living, breathing body. 

This got me thinking (the irony), that maybe depression occurs because people identify with their thoughts too much. At the same time, they are also are averse to feeling bad, so they don't let themselves feel what they're feeling in that moment because it hurts. Then, they are left in rumination, because the only other option is to feel 'bad' emotions. They are continuously running away from their bodies into their thoughts, and unconsciously are averse to accepting their emotional state in the moment. I understand that depression is more than just this (from firsthand experience), because it really is a chronic thing. But this could also apply to cases of emotional stagnation, or the prevention of spiritual or emotional growth. 

Anyways, what do you think?"	t5_2qnc9	True

I thought some people in this subreddit might be interested in this film.  I stumbled upon it through a musical artist that I love who did the soundtrack for the film, and upon watching the trailer, I knew I had to find it.  Upon doing some research, and reaching out to the production company, I was informed that it wasn't in the US yet, and there was an IndieGogo campaign to bring it to the US later this year.  

The film follows 3 ex-soldiers, and 1 child on their path to find some semblance of peace through yoga and meditation.  One intriguing aspect, that I feel would assuage some skeptics, is the treatment is initiated and moderated by well respected scientist Richard Davidson.   

I'm trying to get the word out not only for selfish reasons (I want to see it) but also because I think people in America NEED to see it.  You can see the trailer and find more about the film here - http://danishdocumentary.com/site/freethemind/ and if you'd like to donate to bring the film to the US, you can find the campaign here - www.indiegogo.com/projects/free-the-mind-can-you-rewire-your-brain-just-by-taking-a-breath?c=home

I still had my watch timer set for twenty minutes from whenever it was I last meditated.  It's been so long that my body was quite resistant to sitting.  Twitchy eyes and an achy back and inner thighs.

I couldn't believe it hadn't been twenty minutes.  My back was screaming.  I was in tears but I was determined to keep my eyes shut and sit. I know from past experiences that time can behave strangely while sitting.

I eventually realized that the timer might be set for 22 hours.  I opened my eyes and looked at my watch and I'd been sitting for exactly an hour.  I had great laugh at myself.  I guess you had to be there."	t5_2qnc9	True
1351961144.0	12ki9d	I think I realized a deep truth about meditation today.	jedisjumphigh	171	32	25	"I am new to meditating but not new to exploring my own consciousness.  Today while meditating, I reached the familiar sensation of ""letting go"" of my tension.  This seems to happen in waves, with each wave happening as soon as I ""snap out"" of a thought process and return awareness to my breathing.

I think that many people new to meditating get stuck in the process of returning awareness to their breathing; when you notice yourself thinking, it's natural to think ""Oh, I've been thinking, I should be breathing... breathe in, breathe out""

I think that REAL progress comes when this ""I am thinking, I should be focusing on my breathing"" realization comes not as a thought-realization, but more as a realization of being.  That is to say, you not only realize you are thinking, but you realize with your pure awareness the DEEPER reality underneath the thought.  You don't start thinking ""breath in, breath out"" but rather you simply NOTICE the presence or absence of air in your abdomen, and how much your being wants to inhale or exhale.  With this deep realization comes a feeling of ""tuning in"" to the ""Is-ness"" of your body, and tension will instantly melt away.  "	t5_2qnc9	True

I've recently been reading a book called *Wake Up to Your Life*, in which the author recommends at least 30 minutes per session. I had never done more than 20 before, so I knew it'd be a test. Today was my 3rd day in a row at 30 minutes. It's *long*, but definitely worth it. After 20 minutes, your mind really settles down and some curious things start to occur.

Today, with about 5 minutes left in my session, I felt a vibration start in my neck and move down into my chest. I barely had time to notice the physical phenomenon before it became a mental phenomenon.

Images of all the beings that I have recently come into contact with began flashing one by one in my mind's eye, and I couldn't help but feel an overwhelming love for anything that came to my mind. People, animals, insects, plants - didn't matter. I finally felt compassion towards everything. It felt oddly similar to what I've experienced with MDMA.

Unfortunately, I became overwhelmed with excitement, which obviously pulled me out of the ""trance,"" so it only lasted about 30 to 45 seconds. I'm still very grateful for that experience. It's very humbling, and I hope that I can return there sometime soon.

If you're intimidated by long sessions, just push through it and do 30 minutes. You'll be glad you did.

I make music with a very strict intention to act as a tool or catalyst for intense meditation and introspection. I can say this with certainty since my main drive to create this music has been for my own personal use, and through using it I have experienced such things which I have replicated hundreds of times. Over time many others who have listened under a proper setting have also reported experiencing various effects.  Effects akin to those of brainwave meditation, sensory deprivation, psychedelia, and meditation.  Examples of such felt effects are sensations of inward travelling and body separation, inner eye hallucinations, and illuminations of thought, to name a few.


Share your thoughts with me, please.  I cannot explain how curious I am about how you all might respond to my work.  This is not simply chanting, trance drumming, ambient music or anything else I have encountered, but rather something wholly different.  I am not one for bragging and certainly hope you all can trust me when I say this especially, that this is unlike any other form of music I am aware of.  The best point I can raise in support of this claim is that my initial compulsion to begin this work came from not finding anything like it already in existence.


I have posted my music on other subreddits before in the past, on [/r/Psychonaut](http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/i1vd3/i_promise_psychedeliclike_meditation_and/) and [/r/LucidDreaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/s51ay/offering_my_music_as_a_potential_tool_for_lucid/)... there is a lot of information on the Psychonaut post that I will not bother reiterating here, I also talked to a few people about my music which some might find interesting.


You can find everything I have released [here](http://www.sisterwaize.blogspot.com) along with bits of writing about my music including suggested instructions on how to listen to it and my motivation for making it.

The new album I am releasing with this post can be found [here.](http://archive.org/details/PerennialSuicide)  This album has been made in honor of any and all attempts toward the idea of ego death.

CloudDrone	157	18	36	"I've been dicking around with meditation on and off for a long time, trying to get it right, trying to concentrate, feeling frustrated, and feeling like I was missing a key element, because I could never find a relaxed and stable posture.

Almost a week ago, however, I read Mindfulness in Plain english. One of the best ideas I've ever had in my life was to stop ignoring the constant advice of everyone on here and pick up the book and read it. I learned a lot of hints about posture and after sitting, I realized I was getting close.

But something still felt off... Until tonight. toward the end of my meditation I was especially mindful of how cramped my abdomen feels. After fucking around with everything for a few minutes, I tried to ""open"" my rib cage outward to give more space. Like how it feels when you grab the bottoms of each side of your rib cage and kind of pull to the side and up a little bit, but from the inside, and keeping it in an ""open"" position (and without using my hands.)

Suddenly, by weak little shitty diaphragm muscles started flapping around like a fish out of water, gasping for air. I was sitting stone still, trying to assimilate what was going on. I could feel more oxygen getting to my brain and all of the muscles I was using to hold my ribs open had not really been consciously used like this before. I visually conjured up an image of how a newborn horse looks after it drops on the ground, with now idea how to use any of it's muscles. Yeah, that was me.

After doing some self conscious internet research, I seem to have my methods right, and people commonly breath this way. Huh, I never knew. I had been trying to figure it out years ago when I was trying to improve my singing and speaking skills, but had no idea what I was doing wrong.

1325614032.0	o1bpe	Marijuana is detrimental to meditation because meditation's goal is self mastery.	windchime159	215	80	178	"I hear this argument a lot on here, that weed is fine to smoke while meditating. I have avoiding taking a stance but its starting to bother me so id like to make my point.

I feel like there is a general misconception regarding the purpose of meditation. While I feel its completely fine and a positive thing to meditate for the enjoyment it brings, that is not the purpose of meditation but a symptom of it. 

The reason one meditates is to take control of his being. To discipline yourself to not rely on the material and external world. You cannot attain self mastery through the usage of an external thing.

Its not because weed is bad. Its not because it damages your mind. Its not because you don't have ligament insights while on weed. You meditate so you can attain liberation from attachments, so you can live fully grounded in yourself and not need anything to make you happy, how can you attain this through the use of something external?


edit: for those who say I'm being rude. I don't think I am. This is what I believe and is my stance on the argument. You can disagree or agree, thats fine, i'm just having a discussion about it. I'm sorry if your offended. But consider.. if my stance is right.. is it not right to say so? would others not benefit?

edit2: lol its kind of funny how you cant state your opinion without explaining to everybody its only your opinion. Of course I understand this is only my opinion, I'm saying it arn't I? If you think my point is wrong, say why. It is not rude to state ones opinion, its an invitation to a discussion.

edit3: I guess my concept of meditation is only the Buddhist concept of it. I figured anyone who meditates did so to get rid of attachment [I know thats why I started] and anyone who didn't at first would soon learn through self observation the benifits of ridding one self of attachment... maybe if they stopped smoking pot while they did it.... lol

last edit: While I stand by my origonal point, A few of you have changed my mind about a few things about the subject, I thank you for that. And I would like to apoligize if anyone was offended by the manner of my speech, I argue with conviction and I do respect the choices you make. But I made this post out of compassion in hopes that anyone who IS seeking self mastery or to get rid of attachment, may realize a useful tool of theirs is another subtler form of attachment. Peace to you all.

TL;TR  Its fine if you smoke, its fine if you smoke and meditate together some of the times, but it is NOT okay if you ONLY meditate when you smoke. Because that is attachment, and attachment causes suffering.

Duration: 1-12 months(??)  
##Concentration - Sitting

Sit in as ideal conditions as possible. Ideal means silence, sitting comfortably, with no movement, and no environmental interruptions or distractions ([pdf](http://www.stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/shobogenzo/translations/zazengi/pdf/Zazengi%20translation.pdf) instructions). Focus on the sensation of the air that moves in and our of your nose as you breathe. Do this for 5-30 minutes. 

In this stage, if you have trouble concentrating, try counting. Technically this is not perfect concentration, but that’s fine. It’ll help you learn the technique of focused attention. 

##Insight - Real World Practice
Build a habit of “posture checking.” Ideally every 5-10 minutes throughout the day, for 1-5 seconds, observe your current posture, noting everything about your body position and muscles, like tension, pressure, blood flow, etc. 

The goal is not to correct posture, but feel free. The goal is to develop this habit of checking very frequently on your physical state, because as your abilities in mindfulness grow, having this habit established gives them a place to plug into automatically. Think of it as laying out all the ingredients for a meal you will cook, so that it will be faster and easier to prepare the meal without rummaging in cabinets and measuring things.

##How Do I Know It’s Working?

You will notice the “mental monkey.” You will be surprised at how your mind is basically never at rest—thoughts are constantly arising, songs playing, vivid images and memories popping up, conversations happening, noises from the outside world breaking your concentration and starting you off on other tangents, etc. If you are noticing this, then this is great progress! Many beginners view this as failure, a sign that they are bad at concentrating. Nope! It means you have finally really observed yourself, maybe for the first time. 

Next is to keep your attention completely focused on the breath without any interruption for one inhale and one exhale. As you practice, you may achieve this many times over the course of your sitting period. This is a great sign of progress.

###Advanced Beginner  
Duration: 1-12 months ???  
##Concentration - Sitting

Continue sitting as before. For added challenge: (1) increase your goal of how many inhalations / exhalations you want to concentrate for without interruption, (2) remove the crutch of counting during breathing, or (3) increase sitting time.

This sitting time is **deliberate practice** and is analogous to musicians practicing scales, or martial artists hitting punching bags. Deliberate practice in ideal conditions is necessary to bring out skills in non-ideal conditions. You’re trying to really refine technique here, so you should use your failures to strengthen your skill. A musician will not practice an easy scale as much as a hard one that results in repeated failure, because conquering failure.

##Insight - Sitting
Begin a sitting routine that focuses on noting, awareness, or mindfulness meditation practice (all the same thing). This is different from concentration practice. In concentration practice, you force your attention to stay on one thing. In insight practice, you want to 

1. sit passively and allow sensations and thoughts to enter your mind 
1. then observe these sensations and thoughts, 
1. then set them aside by returning to your breath
1. wait for the next sensation to arise naturally and repeat.  

Sometimes you will get sucked in to your thoughts. That’s OK: just return to your attention to your breath and start over.

Feel free to sub vocalize while observing sensations and thoughts, e.g., “there was a thought about work.” “frustration happened to me because I lost concentration.” “pop song.” This is similar to counting during concentration meditation. 

Lastly, there is a theory element to insight practice (which is why I prefer the word “insight” over “mindfulness”). Observing sensations will yield three realizations:

1. No-Self. The sensations are not “me.” This is hard to explain. Rain falling on you is obviously “not me,” but so also is the frustration I feel for forgetting my umbrella at home. Sometimes I think, “frustration happened,” instead of “I’m feeling frustrated,” to emphasize this disconnect. I welcome others to help me explain this better.
1. Non-permanence. The sensations are fleeting. Everyone knows this analytically, but we often forget it in, ironically, the heat of the moment. The goal of insight practice is to learn this truth intimately.
1. Unsatisfactoriness. The sensations , even the good ones, are ultimately not fulfilling. Clinging to bad feelings makes us feel bad, and clinging to good feelings that are no longer part of this present moment make the present moment pale in comparison to our often rose-colored memory of the past.

##How Do I Know It’s Working?

For concentration:

1. Longer sitting periods with equal concentration, or stronger concentration in similar sitting periods (how many breaths take place before your thoughts tug your attention away?)
1. You may notice increased ability to focus on real world tasks without trying. You may be less susceptible to distraction. This may be especially pronounced right after you finish a sitting period.

For insight:  

1. You’ll start to notice how many distinct feelings, thoughts, and physical sensations make up your daily experience. It’s a lot! 
1. You’ll start to appreciate, probably one at a time, some of the truth of no self, non-permanence, and unsatisfactoriness. E.g., you may notice you are more emotionally stable because you no longer invest yourself personally in your moods, or you may be less bothered by annoyances, knowing they are temporary. You may be less caught up in consumption, gossip, or nostalgia, knowing they are ultimately not fulfilling because they add nothing to your present experience. 

These will continue to be progress markers as your practice develops.

###The Middle (???)  
Duration: Probably long.  

##Concentration - Sitting
Do not count when sitting, and increase meditation time. Attempt walking meditation (read [Mindfulness in Plain English](http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html) for instructions). You’re basically on your own to push yourself to become better at concentration now.

##Insight - Real World Practice
In addition or in place of sitting insight meditation, perform ordinary activities very slowly (e.g., drinking a beverage, folding clothes, typing, etc.). Observe your mind forming the intent to move through the activity, the muscles moving, and all sensations that arise from the activity. 

This method is high power, but low speed, helping to transition to powerful, real-life mindfulness.

How Do I Know It’s Working?  
Concentration: You can experience similar levels of concentration during walking meditation as you did during sitting meditation.

Insight: 

1. Your may observe similar depth of mindfulness doing the slow activities as you had achieved in sitting practice. 
2. You may spontaneously experience mindfulness while going about your daily business. 
1.  You may be able to observe sensations without the sub vocalization (e.g., “this is a cold breeze” becomes a wordless recognition of the sensation). Wordless noting of things like random thoughts or sensations will be similar, but the observations will feel lighter, more distant, fainter, or more quick to fade.

###Advanced (???)  
Duration: Indefinitely.  
##Both Concentration &amp; Insight:  
Sync your breath with any activity done at ordinary speed. Focus on the breath, and observe the activity and its sensations. The goal here is to combine good technique with high speed, but low power. This helps to transition practice to daily life.

##Insight: 
Observe the processes that give rise to sensations like emotions, thoughts, and physical sensation, not just the sensations themselves. In other words, observe observation itself. This sounds confusing, so it may help to visualize this. The way I think of it, there is a screen that separates me from the world, and that screen is my perception. I do not really experience things; I experience what the screen delivers to my mind (e.g., I can’t see infrared because the screen doesn’t see it; but infrared is still real). The goal here is to observe that screen as it goes about its process of generating sensations. 

##How Do I Know It’s Working?  
You may notice greater concentration and awareness popping up throughout your daily activities. You may be able to seize brief moments of idleness or waiting and turn them into a quick insight sitting, in a way. Put differently, you might never experience boredom again if you remember to practice insight meditation.

###Expert (???)  
Duration: Indefinitely  

Attempt full concentration and insight during ordinary daily activities done at ordinary speeds. This means full speed, full power, and full effort on proper technique. Try to incorporate more and more into your day. Unlikely though it is, the hypothetical goal is to be fully concentrated and aware at all times, at the same strength as when doing a sitting practice under ideal conditions.

1350751253.0	11swr2	If you reduce meditation to a 'doing' you will miss. 		161	25	33	"What is meditation? Is it a technique that can be practiced? Is it an effort that you have to do? Is it something which the mind can achieve? It is not.

All that the mind can do cannot be meditation -- it is something beyond the mind, the mind is absolutely helpless there. The mind cannot penetrate meditation; where mind ends, meditation begins. This has to be remembered, because in our life, whatsoever we do, we do through the mind; whatsoever we achieve, we achieve through the mind. And then, when we turn inwards, we again start thinking in terms of techniques, methods, doings, because the whole of life's experience shows us that everything can be done by the mind. Yes. Except meditation, everything can be done by the mind; everything is done by the mind except meditation. Because meditation is not an achievement -- it is already the case, it is your nature.. It has not to be achieved; it has only to be recognized, it has only to be remembered. It is there waiting for you -- just a turning in, and it is available. You have been carrying it always and always.

Meditation is your intrinsic nature -- it is you, it is your being, it has nothing to do with your doings. You cannot have it, you cannot not have it, it cannot be possessed. It is not a thing. It is you. It is your being.

Once you understand what meditation is things become very clear. Otherwise, you can go on groping in the dark.

Meditation is a state of clarity, not a state of mind. Mind is confusion. Mind is never clear. It cannot be. Thoughts create clouds around you -- they are subtle clouds. A mist is created by them, and the clarity is lost. When thoughts disappear, when there are no more clouds around you, when you are in your simple beingness, clarity happens. Then you can see far away; then you can see to the very end of existence; then your gaze becomes penetrating -- to the very core of being.

Meditation is clarity, absolute clarity, of vision. You cannot think about it. You have to drop thinking. When I say, 'You have to drop thinking,' don't conclude in a hurry, because I have to use language. So I say, 'Drop thinking,' but if you start dropping, you will miss, because again you will reduce it to a doing.

'Drop thinking' simply means: don't do anything. Sit. Let thoughts settle themselves. Let mind drop on its own accord. You just sit gazing at the wall, in a silent corner, not doing anything at all. Relaxed. Loose. With no effort. Not going, anywhere. As if you are falling asleep awake -- you are awake and you are relaxing but the whole body is falling into sleep. You remain alert inside but the whole body moves into deep relaxation.
Thoughts settle on their own accord, you need not jump amongst them, you need not try to put them right. It is as if a stream has become muddy...what do you do? Do you jump in it and start helping the stream to become clear? You will make it more muddy. You simply sit on the bank. You wait. There is nothing to be done. Because whatsoever you do will make the stream more muddy.

If somebody has passed through a stream and the dead leaves have surfaced and the mud has arisen, just patience is needed. You simply sit on the bank. Watch, indifferently.

Pukedukem	148	20	33	"I'm a martial artist (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu to be specific) and today in our afternoon class we did a pretty amazing and meditative breathing technique which I thought many of you would enjoy if you hadn't heard of it already. My instructor called it a 'square' breathing technique. We sat down (with no particular instructions on sitting other than back straight, head high for ease of flow to the lungs) and began a 4-step breathing process. The 4 steps are 

 * Breathing in
* Holding with air in lungs
* Breathing out
* Holding with no air in lungs

and each 4 steps are done with the same count and through the nose. For example- Breathe in for 3 seconds, hold air for 3 seconds, breath out for 3 seconds, and no air for 3 seconds. Try anywhere between 3-10 seconds and if it's too hard, go down as many seconds as you need and if it's too easy, go up as many seconds as you need with the ultimate goal of working up towards more time. We did this for about 5-10 minutes. Afterwards we did about 60-120 seconds of *pranayama* (Hard, fast breathing with intense outward breaths through the nose) at increasing intensity and at the end of the 60-120 seconds on our final outward breath, we held our breath with no air in our lungs for as long as possible. I felt absolutely amazing afterwards and not only that, but as an ex cigarette smoker, I literally felt my lung capacity increase almost immediately after the exercise. 

Thanks for reading guys, I hope someone else can benefit from this. I am adding this to my mindfulness *repertoire* and I hope some of you guys enjoy the technique as much as I do."	t5_2qnc9	True
1346533322.0	z77u5	Hi, my name is Bryan		149	20	39	"and I'm addicted to thinking. I've been thinking ever since I can remember. It all started when I was a little kid. My parents must have been so proud to hear my first word. I learned more and more words until I got to the point where I had an entire cocktail of words to choose from. I could mix and match different words in my head and it felt so good! The problems started to arise when I began going to school.

It was at school where I met other kids my own age. Everything seemed alright until I got made fun of. Kids would tease and lie to me. I only had one place to go where I could feel better: my thoughts. As time went on, I stopped paying attention in class and would just get lost in thought after thought. The teacher would call on me and I wouldn't even know what we were doing. This continued for years and slowly began to eat me away from the inside.

Once I got into middle school, the teasing got worse. I couldn't understand it, so I turned to my thinking to try to figure out why this was happening. I spent hours and hours thinking, hoping that it would bring me to some answers. The answers that came sent me further and further into isolation. Eventually all I had was my video games to think about and a few friends I didn't care for.

Everything became a puzzle that needed to be solved by my thoughts. Without realizing it, I had created an isolated world for myself where I felt safe. There was no love in this world; it was nothing but misery. Video games became less and less thought provoking, so I eventually turned to drugs. I couldn't believe how my thoughts changed under the influence. It was like taking steroids for my creative thinking. I felt like I could solve and understand anything in the world. I felt happy, and it was amazing. I would ultimately choose this drug infused world of thinking over anyone else in my life. People became simple means to an end. The suffering grew worse. It got so bad that I contemplated using an easy, permanent solution: death.

It wasn't until my final experience with LSD that I saw the world for the first time and who I really was. My ego had been doused in potent acid and wouldn't be able to filter reality for a few hours. During this time, I saw how my thoughts have created a twisted reality. I have used my thoughts to run away from things I don't like. I have used my thoughts to bury emotions I can't handle. Thinking was my ultimate crutch that lay beneath all of the other little crutches. As long as my thoughts controlled me, I would be lost in pain and suffering. As the climax of the trip came to an end, I wondered how I would ever get back to this beautiful place of love and awareness. It wasn't but a few days before I stumbled upon something I had tried with no success in the past. This something would be the beginning of my journey into reality. 

This something is called meditation.

1362301264.0	19kj70	The Benefits of Meditation	luciiz	145	14	38	"So I've been browsing around here a little bit, and I think the benefits are meditation are being understated.


I first started meditating (Vipassana or insight meditation) about 14 months ago, twice a day. It first started off only being 'able' to meditate for 15-20 minutes at a time (I use a phone alarm to notify me when time is up - this helps me). When I first started out thoughts around the 15 mark always ended up being ""when is this going to end"", ""I'm soooo bored of this"", ""This is too hard"", and it almost felt like very hard cardiovascular exercise just to sit there meditating. When the alarm came on my phone is always felt like a relief.


These days I sit for 35 minutes twice a day, and even now that is becoming too easy so I'm moving it up to 40 minutes a day. Now meditation is a complete ease and the time flies by. Only very rarely to thoughts of ""I'm bored of this"" come up. The meditation often brings a euphoric and relaxed feeling, so sitting is a complete joy. This transformation from 14 months ago of daily practice is remarkable and indicates that SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY HAPPENING HERE. It enfuriates me (maybe I should be more mindful, lol) when I see posts of people seeing no benefits when from meditation WHEN THEY'RE ONLY DOING IT FOR 5 MINUTES A DAY. Well, duh! 5 minutes isn't going to do anything for you. The same as why 5 minutes of running won't do anything for your cardiovascular endurance, or pumping tiny dumbells and expecting massive arms. 


The benefits to my life have been incredible. Stress, anxiety, depression? All gone. This has been remarkable and has made my life very easy to live. I feel I can socialize normally with people now - it's a natural flow instead of jolted awkwardness. When I want to talk, words flow from my mouth. When I want to be silent, I am completely comfortable with it (infact one of my friends once said when there was a 15 second silence ""soo.... this is awkward"" I felt nothing of the sort). Approaching girls is also easier (22 year old male) and I feel like I don't need to impress them any more. I am also no longer always slightly depressed - there has been a noticeable shift in ""feel good"" chemicals in my brain, so much so that I no longer classify myself as depressed (daily exercise and omega-3, vitamin supplements would've helped also). 14 months ago I also used to drink every day, I craved atleast a bottle of wine; when I started meditating this craving slowly disappeared after a few months and now I drink once a week and don't crave that or any other drugs. 


Also I think it's understated how Vipassana should be the main recommended form of meditation; I initially learnt it from Mindfulness in Plain English. Also it needs to be stated more on here that being ""present to the moment"" and ""meditating whilst off the cushion"" ala Eckhart Tolle is greatly complementary to Vipassana. Being present has become a main componenet of my daily life. Long walks to a destination? Present. Driving somewhere? Present. Waiting in a Queue? Present. Eating? Present. Waiting to fall asleep? Present. 


Conclusion? MEDITATION IS AWESOME IT'S CHANGED MY LIFE. FOR ALL THOSE WHO AREN'T - START MEDITATING LIKE YOU EXERCISE - GO HARD OR GO HOME! Continually push the time you can meditate for up by 5 minutes when you feel comfortable in doing so."	t5_2qnc9	True

I joined this meditation thing called Maum Meditation. I still don't know much about cult-ism to correctly call what I'm thinking of, but it's basically a brainwashing group. 

Kind of like a rotten onion, the outside seems perfectly normal but layer after layer as you get in deeper into its roots its rotten, basically. After some time they ask for ""Sky Funds"" to allow your ancestors to go to heaven from purgatory, about 1K USD.

But I think I should start with how the system works. There's 8 ""levels"" of meditation that gets progessively into the foundation of the cult, but there are three ""extra special"" levels ""becoming born"", ""being your born entity"" and a third one they just came up with. They come up with a new level every once in a while and the special levels after the 8 levels cost about 4K USD per person to attend to. 

It's popping up in cities all over the world, but is having a hard time getting started. Please let your friends and lovers know about this cult and to stay away from it at all costs. They say that they are ""science-based"" with questionable UN and Ghandi awards but it's all just an illusion on the outside.

They routinely put spies to track their members (scary shit), check incoming members for electronic devices using the metal detectors, and is pretty much paranoid about getting caught with the media. 

They also ask for you to give up all your life savings, quit your job, and give your life and body to the cause. Look up maum meditation cult on google, and you will see that any negative posts made, they have made sure to comment positively on it."	t5_2qnc9	True

She sent me home with some meditation files and I put them on my iPod and got some headphones.  I did something called alpha waves. At one point I could not feel my body. My hands and arms did not exist.

Trouble no one about his religion.
Respect others in their views and demand that they respect yours.
Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life.
Seek to make your life long and of service to your people.
Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide.
Always give a word or sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend,
or even a stranger, if in a lonely place.
Show respect to all people, but grovel to none.
When you rise in the morning, give thanks for the light,
for your life, for your strength.
Give thanks for your food and for the joy of living.
If you see no reason to give thanks, the fault lies in yourself.
Abuse no one and no thing, for abuse turns the wise ones to fools
and robs the spirit of its vision.
When your time comes to die,
be not like those whose hearts are filled with fear of death,
so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time
to live their lives over again in a different way.
Sing your death song, and die like a hero going home."" - Chief Tecumseh "	t5_2qnc9	True

What about the opposite?

I've been meditating for a two months now. Daily. Right at a big break up while back packing on the other side of the world. In my meditation, I am slowly starting to be mindful of the intolerable person I have been. I'm a liar. I'm have been an ugly person for a long time. But I always glossed over this. A fake it to make it attitude. Compliment and inflate my ego out of insecurities I don't fully understand yet.

Now, I have a difficult game to play with myself. I know, through doing loving kindness sits, that I am going to have a big breakdown on top of the big breakdown from the break up. And I should. I know everything I have done is in the past, but how do I own it in my heart, while forgiving myself like usual?

I quit drinking for the most part. It was a monster inside of me. I quit smoking, it was a chain to a stupid thing. 

I guess my question is this. For the people out there that could be labeled as ""bad"" people, or ""shitty"" people, what do you think about it? And I'm not talking about the people that think they are bad people because they have said mean things to parents, or loved ones. I mean, a life of repeated actions the negatively underscore you and others.

Thank you for your input.

1334901924.0	sj8xv	A Great Explanation Of Why One Should Meditate	amnadu	135	11	20	"I transcribed an Alan Watts recording where he explained the two main reasons why one should meditate. From *Alan Watts Teaches Meditation*. 


**The First Reason We Meditate – To Get In Touch With Reality**

**""**The art of meditation is a way of getting in touch with reality. The reason for it is that most civilized people are out of touch with reality, because they confuse the world as it is with the world as they think about it and talk about it and describe it. For, on the one hand, there is the real world and on the other a whole system of symbols about that world which we have in our minds. These are very useful symbols all civilization depends on them, but like all good things they have their disadvantages and the principle disadvantage is that we can confuse them with reality. Just as we confuse money with actual wealth. And our names about ourselves, our ideas of ourselves, our images of ourselves, *with* ourselves. Now of course reality from a philosophers point of view is a dangerous word. A philosopher will ask me, “What do I mean by reality? Am I talking about the physical world of nature? Or am I talking about a spiritual world? Or what?” And to that I have a very simple answer - when we *talk* about the material world, that is actually a philosophical concept. So in the same way if I say reality is spiritual, that’s also a philosophical concept, and reality itself is not a concept.

Reality is …[he bangs on a gong and we hear the noise resonate for a while]… and we won’t give it a name.

Now it’s amazing what doesn’t exist in the real world. For example, in the real world there aren’t any things, nor are there any events. That doesn’t mean to say that the real world is a perfectly featureless blank. It means that it is a marvelous system of wiggles, in which we describe things and events in the same way as we would project images on a Rorschach blot or pick out particular groups of stars in the sky and call them constellations as if they were separate groups of stars. Well, they’re groups of stars in the minds’ eye, in our systems of concepts, they are not out there as constellations already grouped in the sky. 

So in the same way the difference between myself and all the rest of the universe is nothing more than an idea, it is not a real difference. And meditation is the way in which we come to feel our basic inseparability from the whole universe. And what that requires is that we shut up… That is to say that we become internally silent, and cease from the interminable chatter that goes on inside our skulls.

Because, you see, most of us think compulsively all the time - that is to say we talk to ourselves. Now obviously if I talk all the time, I don’t hear what anyone else has to say, and so in exactly the same way if I think all the time - that is to say if I talk to myself all the time - I don’t have anything to think about except thoughts. And therefore I’m living entirely in the world of symbols and I’m never in relationship with reality.**""**

**The Second Reason We Meditate – There is no Reason**

This is going to be a little bit more difficult to understand. We could say that meditation doesn’t have a reason, or doesn’t have a purpose. And in this respect, it’s almost unlike all other things that we do, except perhaps making music and dancing. Because, when we make music, we don’t do it in order to reach a certain point, such as the end of a composition. If that were the purpose of music, to get to the end of the piece, then obviously the fastest players would be the best. And so likewise, when we are dancing, we are not aiming to arrive at a particular place on the floor, as we would be if we were taking a journey. When we dance, the journey itself is the point. When we play music, the playing itself is the point. And exactly the same thing is true in meditation.

Meditation is the discovery that the point of life is always arrived at in the immediate moment. And, therefore, if you meditate for an ulterior motive – that is to say, to improve your mind, to improve your character, to be more efficient in life – you’ve got your eye on the future and you are not meditating. Because, the future is a concept; it doesn’t exist. As the proverb says, “Tomorrow never comes.” There is no such thing as tomorrow; there never will be, because time is always now. That’s one of the things we discover when we stop talking to ourselves and stop thinking; there is only a present – only an eternal now. 

It’s funny then, isn’t it, that one meditates for no reason at all. Except we could say, ‘for the enjoyment of it,’ and here I would interpose the essential principal that 'meditation is supposed to be fun'. And it’s not something you do as a grim duty. The trouble with religion as  we know it, is that it is so mixed up with grim duties, ‘we do it because it’s good for you; it’s a form of self-punishment’. 

Well, meditation when correctly done has nothing to do with all that. It’s a kind of digging in the present; it’s a kind of grooving with the eternal now. And it brings us into a state of peace where we can understand that the point of life, the place where it’s at, is simply here and now.**""**"	t5_2qnc9	True

1360436995.0	187dih	Some things that help me quiet my mind during sits	goo22	144	25	26	"Hello fellow meditators! just a couple of tips that i think may be helpful in quieting the mind during a meditation that have helped me a lot along the way. They are some techniques mentioned in Eckhart Tolle's books that seemed to help me, I highly recommend reading his 2 books.

When your focusing on your breath but you cant really get in the zone, here are a few things I do.

1 - Notice the absolute silence that pervades the background.  Even if you are meditating in a noisy environment, if you focus strongly you can hear a permanent silence in which the noises arise from. For me it almost resembles like a really low tone ringing of the ears.  When you focus all your attention on that silence, I find that I have very few thoughts and I can really get into that zone of no-mind. Like Tolle says, the silence in you is what notices the silence without.

2 - Listening and focusing all your attention on sounds that occur.  This one goes hand in hand with the first. Forget your breath for a moment, and focus entirely on that silence mentioned in the first tip, and then when noise enters your field of presence, notice it, and then back to the silence. It is very similar to waiting, but not the anxious type of waiting that is considered a means to an end, but rather a conscious type of waiting, being totally present waiting for the next noise to occur.

3 - Flow with life.  When I can't get in the zone and my mind is running rampant, I accept that this is the case at the moment, and just completely let go of all tension and all control of my being and let life run through me. Don't self retract into a marmot hole, but rather open up completely to whatever your situation is at the present moment.  Let go of EVERYTHING, stay completely unattached. Here is a quote which was posted here once which resonated with me ""When we engage in the practice of discovering space, we should develop the feeling of opening ourselves out completely to the entire universe. We should open ourselves with absolute simplicity and nakedness of mind. This is the powerful and ordinary practice of dropping the mask of self-protection.""
This is taken from this awesome article, http://www.nyingma.com/dzogchen1.htm

4 - Feeling the inner body. I'm sure this has been suggested plenty, but directing your attention to different areas of your body (hands, feet, arms, legs, belly, head) takes all your attention away from thinking.  Don't think about your body, go there directly with your attention and feel it from within. This gets you to the no-mind state also. There are plenty of youtube videos of Echkart describing this one. Just look up Eckhart Tolle inner body awareness or something like that if you're interested.

Some pretty basic things here, but they have helped me out tremendously, so feel free to give them a try and let me know if they help you along your path!

1362148262.0	19goor	Text from a 8000 year old Indian text - The Yoga Vashista. As a meditator, I found it very interesting	SattvicGamer	144	20	43	"Vasistha continued: From the Supreme Brahman (consciousness), the mind first arose, with its faculty of thinking and imagination. And this mind remains as such in that Brahman, even as fragrance in a flower, as waves in the ocean, and as rays of light in the sun.

Brahman, which is extremely subtle and invisible, was forgotten, as it where, and thus arose the wrong notion of the real existence of the world-appearance.

If one thinks that the light rays are different and distinct from the sun, to him the light rays have a distinct reality. If one thinks that a bracelet made of gold is a bracelet, to him it is indeed a bracelet, and not gold.

But if one realises that the light rays are non-different from the sun, his understanding is said to be without duality (Truth/ nirvikalpa). 

If one realises that the waves are non-different from the ocean, his understanding is said to be without duality (Truth/ nirvikalpa).

If one realises that the bracelet is non-different from gold, his understanding is said to be without duality (Truth/ nirvikalpa).

He who sees the display of sparks, does not realise that it is but fire. His mind experiences joy and sorrow, as these sparks fly up and scatter on the ground.

If he sees that the sparks are but fire and non-different from it, he sees only fire, and his understanding is said to be without duality (Truth/ nirvikalpa).

He who is thus established in the nirvikalpa is indeed a great one.

His understanding does not diminish. He has attained whatever is worth attaining. His heart does not get enmeshed in the objects.

Hence, O Rama, abandon this perception of diversity or objectification, and remain established in consciousness.

Whatever the self contemplates, is materialised on account of the inherent power in the consciousness. That materialised thought then shines as if independent!

Thus, whatever the mind (which is endowed with the faculty of thought) contemplates, materialises instantly. This is the origin of diversity. Hence, this world-appearance is neither real nor unreal.

Even as sentient beings create and experience diverse objects in their own day-dreams, this world-appearance is the day-dream of Brahman (consciousness).

When it is realised as Brahman, then the world-appearance is dissolved. For, from the absolute point of view, this world is non-existent.

Brahman remains as Brahman, and it does not create something which was not already in existence!

O Rama, whatever you do, know that it is nothing but pure consciousness.

Brahman alone is manifest here as all this, for naught else exists.

1371422254.0	1gh8rv	I realised this morning while sitting that my mind is quite literally overflowing with thoughts.	bluecaravan	148	27	72	"I was practicing Pema Chodron's instruction to simply and non-judgementally label thoughts ""thinking"" whenever they come up. Lo and behold, pretty much every two seconds, I was silently saying ""thinking"" in my head. I never realised before how many thoughts come and go, flit in and out without invitation, without trigger, just totally randomly. 

It was like watching butterflies. At first I got annoyed at how many there were flying everywhere; after a while of reminding myself to be compassionate and gentle towards my own mind and thoughts, it faded to a sort of gentle amusement and even a sense of wonder at the sheer number and variety of them.

I felt like, for the first time, I really truly experienced the truth of this passage from ""Mindfulness in Plain English"":

&gt;When you first begin this procedure, expect to face some difficulties. Your mind will wander off constantly, darting around like a drunken bumblebee and zooming off on wild tangents...
&gt;
&gt;Somewhere in this process, you will come face-to-face with the sudden and shocking realization that you are completely crazy. Your mind is a shrieking, gibbering madhouse on wheels barreling pell-mell down the hill, utterly out of control and hopeless. No problem. You are not crazier than you were yesterday. It has always been this way, and you just never noticed. You are also no crazier than everybody else around you.

1368725370.0	1egn4q	10 day Magic Mushroom Meditation Fast	crackediphoneglass	257	137	263	"Hello Reddit Meditation 

I wanted to let you all know that I have decided to embark on a journey. I have started a 10 day fast where I will be only eating magic mushrooms. 

I am doing this because I am a seeker and I believe that mushroom hold answers for me. I am on day three and the results I am experiencing are absolutely mind blowing. I am keeping a blog here for those who want to follow me on my journey. 

http://crackediphoneglass.wordpress.com/

I am not recommending that others follow me on my journey. I have worked my way up to this and feel prepared to go to the depths and the heights that I will be going to. I hope that throughout this experience I might come out with greater understanding on how other can venture down this road while feeling safe. If that is their calling. 

What I am finding is that there are concepts outside of human understanding that can't be explained to us through words. When I go into the state that I am in after consuming magic mushrooms these concepts are able to be shown to me in ways beyond words. 

It is very hard to put in to words but it makes perfect sense in my head. I am going to do my best to explain the unexplained on my blog. 

I hope you will join me. Cheer me on. Throw questions or critiques at me. I am game. I think your involvement might help me go deeper. 

Thank you"	t5_2qnc9	True

I've been able to experience oneness, through meditation, one time to a small degree. It was a feeling of bliss, a loss of self, and a feeling of love and connection with humanity.

I tried LSD for the first time this weekend, and man oh man, I believe I actually became one with the Universe. That's how it felt like. My sense of self completely disappeared. My ego disappeared. I felt the energy of life flowing through me, and I felt the same energy flowing through everyone else.

I felt love for everyone, because I was everyone. But there was no I anymore.

I no longer saw features and faces, I saw things in their purest form. I saw life in it's purest form. I perceived people as energy and light and that's all there was. There was hot and cold energy, and this drove everything, the push and pull of the universe, the yin and the yang.

Life felt so beautiful. I felt so much love for all of creation. It's incorrect to say that ""I"" felt love. because there was no I. It simply was, and there was only love.

Every now and then, the energy of life would want to express it self and it would make me dance in amazing ways. Then the energy would choose over someone else, and another would express life by dancing. Rhythm was important, life seemed to follow rhythm and it felt like the heartbeat of all living things.

At some point, to comeback down, I regained my sense of self by remembering names and places and this led me back to myself. I had to detach my energy and recreate my ego.

For the next few hours, my brain felt as if it had been reshaped and was slow setting into place. Much like jello is initially liquid and it begins to take it's shape as it settles.

During the trip, and the comedown, I had a sense of enlightenment. I understood. I feel changed.

1376497241.0	1kcthg	Why is the ego bad?	mikluap	135	17	73	"I know one of the main focuses of meditation is to get rid of the idea of oneself and all the cultural associations, morals, customs, ethics, etc. you have for yourself and that this is not really your identity.

I guess my issue with this is that I'm failing to see why having an identity that's constructed through beliefs is something we should get rid of. Isn't it human nature to find an identity? The same reason why a middle-schooler would dress in all black to be socially accepted with the goth kids, or why a businessman may need to wear a suit and tie to look presentable. Those are things that society normalizes because humans are just social and cultures happen naturally. 

That being said, I can agree with this ideal of ""stripping away the identity of oneself"" that I'm constantly hearing about in that realistically and scientifically, your identity doesn't really exist, it's just made. And that identity can make you think certain ways that in many cases can negatively guide your thoughts and emotions (ex: You should think this way because you were raised by liberal/conservative parents). Is the key here neutrality?

I know I kind of contradicted myself here but I kind of see it as having the best of both worlds. You can't completely ignore the fact that you have an identity because it's just the reality of our society, but at the same time, you have to remind yourself that your beliefs don't make up you. ""you"" is more of a fabrication.

You could say that we are together creating a culture. We bring different assumptions and values to the table. And we influence each other in different ways, obviously and subtly.

There are several issues at stake... The definition of what meditation is, for example. People have strong opinions about this. I've seen many comments saying things like ""that is not meditation"" or ""meditation is like this, not like that."" This is inevitable -- we can't talk about something if we don't have an idea of what it is. But we also have a responsibility -- from the perspective of social interaction, intellectual honesty, open-mindedness, and so on -- to be careful and receptive when making statements like these.

I personally lean towards Buddhism and Zen, but I also (like most of us, probably) have a strong bent towards science and secularism. I partake in Buddhist forums as well, and I try to be mindful of the different conversations going on.

It seems to me like the raison d'etre of this particular place is to talk about meditation from a perspective that is wide, curious, personal, non-pushy, and so on. In other words not a place for sectarian squabbling. (We generally do a great job.) In some ways I think that this kind of discussion, as it's going on right now, is the seed for a future growing movement.

So please, stay interested, curious, zestful, engaged, diligent, open, and honest! And let's keep having this very important conversation, and share our findings and questions."	t5_2qnc9	True

Ten Guides Along the Path (Powang Sammaeron)

1. Don’t hope for perfect health. Perfect health leads only to greater greed.
“Treat illness as medicine, not disease”—so spoke the Enlightened One.

2. Don’t long for a life free from hardship–such a life leads only to
haughtiness and self-pampering. “Make worries and hardships a way of life”
—so spoke the Enlightened One.

3. Don’t hope for a lack of impediments in your study. “Release is hiding right behind obstructions”—so spoke the Enlightened One.

4. Don’t hope for a lack of temptations in your training. A lack of temptations will only serve to soften your resolve. “Treat temptations as friends who are
helping you along the path”—so spoke the Enlightened One.

5. Don’t hope for easy success. Easy accomplishment leads only to increased
rashness. “Accomplish through difficulties”—so spoke the Enlightened One.

6. Don’t hope to get your own way with friends. Having friends give in to your wishes only leads to arrogance. “Make long-term friends through compromise in your relationships”—so spoke the Enlightened One.

7. Don’t expect people to follow your wishes or commands. This, too, leads to
arrogance. “Consider those who differ with you to be your character builders”
—so spoke the Enlightened One.

8. Don’t expect rewards for your kindnesses. This leads only to a scheming mind. “Throw out expectation of rewards like you’d thrown out old shoes”
—so spoke the Enlightened One.

9. Don’t expect more out of life than you deserve. Exaggerated profit-seeking leads only to foolishness. “Become rich at heart with small amounts”
—so spoke the Enlightened One.

10. Don’t complain about vexations. This leads only to resentment and poison in the heart. “Consider vexations as the first door on the path”—so spoke the Enlightened One.

1352408295.0	12vjxb	My first meditation inside a lucid dream FANTASTIC	Forevernade	136	23	49	"I think this is a great landmark for me! I just had my first lucid dream where I took appropriate conscious control over myself by meditating INSIDE the lucid dream! It was a strange feeling indeed, as I closed my mind's eye and concentrated on my breathing, increased my awareness of everything etc I felt incredibly relaxed and incredibly free!

I was experiencing some level of anxiety in my lucid dream before experiencing the meditation. It was an aggressive dream, unlike most lucid dreams I have, similar people would attack me if I talked about my lucidity, and the dreamscape was resisting change, and my perceptions were limited and 'stuffy'. It was basically a lucid semi-nightmare. The anxiety built up over the course of the dream and in the end I was getting frustrated and anxious about my experience. When I closed my mind's eye the dreamscene disappeared, and I disappeared, but my awareness and lucidity was still functional because of the meditation. Now, normally if I closed my mind's eye in a dream I would soon lose consciousness and go back into a non-lucid dream, or I would simply not dream for a while, but this time I felt a pure awareness.

After some moments of meditation (time is hard to describe in dreams) I felt I could lock my concentration onto the state of my mind, I could 'feel' the stability of the dream in a non-visual sense, I could also 'feel' my lucid awareness (detached from my body) isolated in the non-visual environment (less like I am seeing black, more like being a blind person), and I could 'feel' my sleeping body all at the same time!

It was a fantastic experience, and I was able to be aware and focused on more things than I have ever been able to in my life...

And when I opened my mind's eye back into the dream, my anxiety was gone, I had no wants or need, no lusts nor hungers, and my suffering was gone for a brief period before I woke. I could never have imagined I would appreciate an 'inactive' lucid dream..."	t5_2qnc9	True

I've wanted to do an extended set of nightly meditations for several years now, but I've always had a really great knack for not following through.  So this January I'm committing to 100 days of consecutive nightly meditation.  As a long-time amateur meditator and frequent reader of /r/meditation, I thought it would be appropriate to see if anyone here was interested in joining.

Some details:

*  I'll be doing this at home, privately and I'm not interested in meeting up with anyone, so I'm not trying to pitch you on a retreat or anything like that.  I'm looking mainly for the support and accountability a group provides, in the hope that if any one of us gets tired or starts to slack, we'll feel like we have other people to support us.

*  I'm not a pro by any means (if that term even applies.)  As a result this doesn't involve adhering to an particular set of practices, although I'll be following some, as my focus is on Kundalini yoga in the tradition of The Secret of the Golden Flower, Gopi Krishna, JJ Semple, Igor Kufayev, etc.

*  I will be starting Jan. 1 and continue through April 10th. EDIT:  I'm hoping to shoot for an hour per sitting but it would be up to each person to determine how much time they could adequately devote.

*  I'll be documenting the experience either through a blog or video or both.

Let me know if you'd like to join and maybe we can set up an email list or something like that.

Never posted here but have been a subscriber for a long time. I thought you'd maybe want to hear something interesting I thought of after a short meditation session last night. 

This is usually how sessions go. I sit down and begin focusing on my breath, not counting but just feeling. Of course my mind wanders and I bring it back. After awhile, my mind calms down and I just get some lingering thoughts here and there. Afterwards I feel clear headed and refreshed. 

However, I discovered I'd been fooling myself this entire time and I wasn't focusing on my breath I was focusing on my *idea* of the breath. Last night, after focusing on what I thought was the breath, I watched myself watch what I was watching(right?). It turned out I had this movie of this perfect coherent breath going on in my head and was watching that. (Note: this wasn't an image per se, more of a conception of what was going on; I think we tend to do this a lot in day to day life unknowingly)

After taking my attention off of that I found *it*. I found the (what we call) breath! It was so much different than what I usually saw. It was varied in almost every way and it was perfectly imperfect. The best part about this was, it took no effort to keep watching it.

A lot of you may be like ""so what?"". Well I'll tell you what. This has revealed to me a huge idea about how my(our?) mind works. The moment we drop all of our conceptions of the world is the moment we empty our minds. And, as Aristotle said “Nature abhors a vacuum” and the universe comes to fill up our minds. 

(Note: I used the word 'conception' here instead of 'preconception' because the latter insinuates we are thinking *before* the thing being thought of. From my experiences in meditation, it seems the conceptions are sitting there like a dam and are as present as the things themselves. We only need to drop the conceptions to let the water flow. The question now becomes, how do we train our minds to drop the conceptions and let the universe flow in? I think that is the point of meditation. To train our minds to separate ourselves from our conceptions so we may finally live.)

I like to compare this sort of experience to something like this: it's been so hot for a few weeks that you (naturally) *expect* it to be hot when you step outside. But there was a cold front you didn't know about last night, so when you step outside today you are completely taken off guard and truly experiencing how wonderful 70 degrees is.

or

You expect one more step upon going down the stairs but you've reached the bottom and are taken off guard.

or

You lean back too far in your chair.

In all of these experiences your mind is completely empty at least for a moment or two. My hypothesis is that the transition of these empty headed moments from fleeting/involuntary to constant/controlled is one of the ultimate goals of meditation. 

Thoughts?

**TL;DR**: Surprise me.

1354630745.0	149g4h	Official Tips and Tricks Guide for our New /r/meditation Visitors.  Beginners, Start Here!	esnaw	127	23	20	"Hey everyone!  Since we are the subreddit of the day, lets compile a list of quick and easy techniques that anyone can use, to help guide our new visitors.  Now, meditation is an ancient, lifelong area of study that you are just now taking your first steps in.  There are as many definitions of what meditation is as there are people practicing, but one thing I think we all can agree on is that meditation seeks to slow down and stop the constant, uncontrollable, internal dialogue that may be holding us back, or preventing us from being involved in the world around us.  

So, here are some quick tips that you can do anywhere at anytime to help stop that constant monkey mind!

1.  Try speaking out loud your internal dialogue.  I have been using this one a lot after staying up all night studying for exams.  Speaking out whatever crazy thing you are thinking about will help you let it go and not keep dwelling on it for too long.


2. Get vigorous physical excessive.  This is one that people have always known about.  Long hikes, walks, jogging and biking have a way of helping reboot your mind so you can start fresh.


3.  Try consciously speaking one word of your internal dialogue with each in and out breath.  I use this one while trying to go to sleep.  Every in breath say one word in your mind, then on the out breath say another.  So.... you... end... up... thinking.... like... this....


4. Try doing Ohm's.  Ohhhhmmmmmm is that thing you see monks doing on tv and movies.  Basically you take a slow breath in, then slowly and deeply breath it out making a noise.  Mentally trace your way up from your feet to the top of your head, saying O while going up your legs, AH while going up your chest, and M while going up your head.  Try doing it ten times in a row.


5. Look and listen to the world around you.


And finally, my most important tip for anyone practicing meditation is to keep a journal!  You will not remember any of the little revelations you have about your life six months from now, let alone a year or two.  So in order to progress, and not keep re-learning the same lessons, you must write them down.  That way you will be able to come back after a while and see how much progress you have made, and build upon what you have already learned.

So, if any of these strike your fancy go ahead and try them out right now!  And remember, don't freak out!

I'm a nearly 18 year old with a history of drug abuse, while I particularly was never uncomfortable with my use upon reflection a lot of it was so. I used weed daily for a good 6 or so months in order to escape becoming my thoughts because my life was in some kind of peril that I couldn't quite put my finger on; I fell out from reality along with slight psychedelic abuse (no where near to the degree of weed) at points even consuming psychedelics in order to face my psychedelic habit. 

In 2009 I got into my first real relationship, early 2012 she cheated on me but I ended up getting back with her, a choice I now see is the cause of the majority of my unhappiness. a few days prior to valentines day she finally broke up with me; I didn't have the courage or integrity to put an end to a relationship I was aware was dysfunctional. She was my greatest love but after events transpired my failure to trust her resulted in me relying hugely on cannabis for an escape. 

Since the breakup i've been making an active effort to stay sober; at first it hurt, like i'd been hollowed out, but I realized that it was my own fault and that I need to stop hiding from reality; now that I wasn't tied down by this relationship I could finally start doing things for myself

thankfully the effort isn't lonesome, I have some good close friends that have been keeping me occupied and i'm talking a lot to another girl that went through something similar, but far worse than I. Sober was still something I couldn't fully be comfortable with, so I decided to give meditation and prayer a go. Not in the religious context; more just directing my thoughts about self as if they're at someone else, acknowledging what I want, followed by the meditation... 

20 minutes of a standard breathing meditation later I realized, everything is okay; everything will be okay. I have lots of friends that are there for me when I need them, everything is currently going very well for me and i'm no longer trapped in a relationship I don't really want to be in, despite how much I loved the girl. That hollow feeling was replaced by a complete glowing warmth that's still with me now.
Each day i'm getting closer to people, making an effort to be a far better person than I was and in general spread that warmth; the confidence of my self has increased and i'm no longer second guessing things I say because I realize there's no need. 

I've been making an effort to stick to my routine of self directed prayer followed by meditation and I am honestly far more comfortable; tranquil and overall happy, There's still a lot of work to be done on my part so as to make some real life progress; but i'm finally taking those steps and the life high is taking me swiftly to greater places; at the core of it all it doesn't really matter where I go because I finally know what it feels like to be legitimately happy and content with life

I just felt like sharing my story because honestly, this may be the best thing that's happened to me and meditating my way through the surface thoughts has really helped me to accept and move on, I cannot describe how happy I feel as a result, but this song conveys the feeling really well https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9Me4KIiPLU

1340131795.0	vadiz	The terror of time	mmmagnetic	110	15	27	"I just recently noticed how much I actually dread the passing of time. Not in the ""I´m going to die someday"", but the actual, hour-to-hour progression of the day.

I would start the day, look at the clock, and think: ""I´ve got the whole day ahead of me!"" Doing this and that, and suddenly: ""Oh no, it´s so late ALREADY? I better get started doing something important."" At which point I would usually plop down on the couch and browse the web or whatever. A few hours later: ""Oh man, I wasted so much time today, and now it´s so late already, what a pathetic sadsack I am!""

So I was browsing a huge ""Complete Calvin &amp; Hobbes"" volume, when I came across a strip where Calvin runs around completely out of his mind - the summer break was coming to an end! ""Oh no! It´s already half an hour later than it was half an hour ago! Run! RUN!""

And that was me. I was being terrorized by the clock.

...

Alan Watts explained that things like the clock are instruments, ways to find a common tool to organize of world - but not the actual reality. How long is an hour? It can take an eternity, it can also go by in a flash.

I´m very often in the mindset of ""okay, I´ve got half an hour to play some videogames, I need to really focus hard on enjoying the time!"" By trying to grasp it, it fell out of my hands.

And as Eckhart Tolle put it so beautifully: ""What time is it? The time is NOW. It has always been NOW and it will always be NOW. Imagine a world with only plants and animals - the question ""What date is it today?"" is quite meaningless.""

...

One of the weirdest realisations I´ve had recently was when I was at a river with a huge bridge crossing it. I looked across on the other side. I walked over the bridge, looked back on the side I just came from, and started wondering: ""This is odd. I was just there, and now I am here. I used to look at the other side, and now I´m standing here, looking at where I was standing just a moment ago."" As much as I usually think of time as something linear - the way I´ve been tought to think about it - at this moment it felt really circular, soft, and almost mushy to me, which felt really good.

Or when something dreadful is coming up: One moment you´re absolutely fearing it coming, and one blink of an eye it´s already over, and you´re having a laugh. It wasn´t so bad, was it? But in the past, the anxiety was very real. Now it´s gone, and it only faintly echoes in your mind.

...

I realized that time is my friend - not my enemy. Without the rhythm of things passing, my heart wouldn´t beat, the clouds wouldn´t pass, and beautiful things would never be able to happen. Pain would last forever.

And really, time doesn´t exist. Not in a smug, esoteric ""like, time isn´t real, dude"", in a purely hypothetical concept - but I´m starting to realize that it ACTUALLY doesn´t exist. There is only now. When tomorrow arrives, it will be now. And yesterday is a memory, remembered now. Between the neverending torrent of seconds, hours, days and years, there only remains the vast open space of presence and awareness.

The words weren't formed until journaling after. However, in a moment of breathing, focusing on the breath, I felt how it could be connected to change. 

Each breath is unique. You feel each differently than the one before it and even than the one after. In fact, it's how you think of the breath as well: it's an anchor in the present moment because you aren't comparing to the breath before, and you aren't thinking of the breath after. You're breathing knowing that you're breathing. Just this breath; this one here, now, and new. 

I realized: how many times a day you are taking in something new! Something changed! And you welcome it at that. When that breath comes in, it becomes you in its entirety. Then when it's time to breathe out, the breath is transitioning into the past, and how easily you let it go. In and out. 

So for me, and for anyone else who has very averse reactions to change: we deal with it closely, subtly everyday. "	t5_2qnc9	True

EDIT: Thanks for all the advice! I tried it for the first time today, focusing on nothing but my breathing. It was a six mile run, and I found a different sort of pleasure from it. But as my mind has not yet been trained at all, I found it wandering. Every time, I tried to gently guide my thoughts back to my breathing, as so many people have advised me.

1355171385.0	14mez1	This might be drifting from the topic a little, but meditation, as it relates to mindful eating, has shown me how important it is to maintain a healthy diet, and pay attention to what you eat.	CloudDrone	111	16	46	"Through meditation, I became more aware of what I was eating, and realized that I had been struggling against a gluten intolerance for the last few years. I successfully rid myself of any gluten in my diet, along with all of the nasty side effects that came with it.

A result of not being bloated, gassy, moody, and clouded in my head, was a much more focused practice, and a clearer mind. This allowed me to begin sitting at longer intervals.

Meditation and being mindful of diet also affected my relationship with alcohol. Putting that stuff in your body, at the large quantities you might sometimes do, will definitely affect the state of your health.

So, this is just a reminder, to anybody else who has been thinking about this as well. Pay attention to what you eat, and the effects of it on your body. I'm sure you find that if you eat large amounts of heavy foods, you will feel drowsy (unless your body needs it to repair muscle tissue or something) and high transfat fastfoods and things will affect the way you feel.

I encourage you to be mindful about what goes in your body, how it goes in your body (chewing and pacing) and pay attention to how your body reacts to it. Keep your good health in mind, and be nice to your body."	t5_2qnc9	True

I have horrible anxiety and racing thoughts pretty much 24/7. My brain feels incapable of thinking, all my muscles tensed up and ready to spring and I feel like I should always be doing something. I'm constantly looking for new things to stimulate my brain, surfing the web playing new games etc but when I get to them they are not satisfying at all and I once again feel like I should be doing something else! This is my story and it's very frustrating.

Anyway. I started meditation two days ago. Today I meditated for 20 minutes on my breathe, and finally my thoughts seemed to slow down. the tension in my body eased slightly. Things actually seemed worth doing now and my anxiety eased up too. 

My question is this: If I keep up with meditation like this, will I be able to banish my horrible racing thoughts/anxiety?

I was meditating outside and a thought came to me that I felt I should not discard. It said, ""Do not seek enlightenment, do not seek anything. Explore"" To put a label on enlightenment is to make it into a mental object. I am not seeking that, I am exploring. An explorer of consciousness.

I cannot try to be like another. I journey towards what they journey towards and I will be there peer rather than pupil. This is the way to go on a spiritual journey. Explore.

First off I just want to say that r/meditation is awesome. 

I have been meditating 15min/weekday mornings for the past 6 months or so.  This week I decided to start doing it everyday after something happened. 

Like most newbies, I was counting my breath (""going back to one"") and trying to keep my focus on the sensation of breath in my nostrils.  It was a relatively good session (less mental clatter than usual), when out of nowhere my mind locked onto my breath awareness of it's own accord and stayed there.  It felt so surreal because I wasn't actively doing it, but I went with it, and eventually it faded back to normal.  

I remember feeling a wonderful glow while it was happening.  Is this what meditation without applied thought is like?  

This is the first thing to change about my meditation since I've started and it's really inspired me to keep it up.

Also, I was thinking of trying a meditation group.  Is it hard to jump to longer meditation sessions (i.e. 30 - 60 mins) if you're only use to 15min?

my own experience and journey"	JordanLeDoux	103	15	11	"I began meditating with a friend who was very familiar with the practice. He had used meditation to enter altered states of counciousness, explore other planes of existence, and explore himself.

He was a big believer in emptiness meditation, whereas I was only familiar with focus meditation.

Now, for those who are unfamiliar with meditation or are just starting, this is my experience: focus meditation will allow you to focus and explore an idea or a thing, while emptiness meditation involves stopping thought and then experiencing.

Most people can achieve some level of focus meditation, even on their first time, but emptiness meditation is often difficult, especially for those raised in Western cultures. Our minds chatter, and are filled with the ramblings of our existence. This is, I now understand, based on a ""lie"" that many people believe. That lie, is that you *are* your thoughts.

To those that have no experience at all with meditation, the idea of stopping thought is kind of strange. Not thinking? That's like not breathing.

I tried. I really did. But stopping my thoughts... it was hard. I tried with music, I tried with a totem, I tried with other people, I tried by myself. It was frustrating... trying so hard.

One night however, I started just like several others. I turned off the lights, set up an end table that I could sit in front of with a pillow for me to sit on, lit two candles, lit a stick of incense, and put on instrumental music... a genre called ""post-rock"". The song was [""We Happy Few"" by The Calm Blue Sea](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhhfk_1Pwhw).

I closed my eyes, let the music wash over me, and tried to empty my mind. I started to run in circles in my mind, just as I always had. Then I stopped trying. Each other time I had stopped trying I had gotten up to do something ""more productive"", but this time... this time I decided to stay there and not try.

At some point... at some point I ""succeeded"". It's difficult for me to describe the point at which it happened, because I wasn't really concious of it.

And while I was experiencing, I understood. It was like I was my true self. The me that is aware, not the me that thinks, or feels, or plans, or judges, or fears. Just me. And yet, it was like I was everything. I could reach out and experience other things. Not really through will. You don't choose to, choosing requires thought. You just do.

It was one of the most incredible experiences I've ever had. And yet it was so natural. After... time... I experienced thought that wasn't mine. It was like experiencing the thought of someone else. I guess some people would describe it like ""hearing"", but it wasn't really.

""What are you doing?"" it asked me. Was it my subconcious? Probably. It felt very different though. The experience was one that I could very easily characterize as having a conversation with God, which post-humously I found interesting because I had not intention or inkling of interacting with a deity during my meditation.

""Nothing.""

""Do you want to do nothing?""

""...No...""

""Then do something.""

'We' of course were not talking about myself in that moment. We were talking about myself as a trajectory through life.

""Do what?"" I asked.

""That's the right question."" A pause. I knew that the conversation, and that part of the experience was over.

I openned my eyes, but strangely, was still able to maintain my emptiness meditation. The song was different. I stared at the smoke from the incense rising between the candles. The world looked different. I was seeing, yes. My eyes were the same. And yet, when I looked at something it was as if I could see it from all perspectives... I later described it... it was like... seeing in four dimensions... or something. Very difficult to describe.

I experienced the room. My eyes never left the smoke, and I just experienced.

If you are new to meditation, or have never experienced emptiness meditation, you've probably asked someone who has what it is like. And almsot surely, they have started their rambling answer with ""it's difficult to describe"". This is true. Description conveys information which instigates a thought. But this experience is achieved by clearing thought. Thought gets in the way of understanding what this type of experience is like, and so though I could spend one million words, I could never convey to you what it is truly like.

It would be like trying to fill a cup with juice by using hundreds of gallons of water. No matter what I say, it will only be a further diversion of your time which could be used to choose to experience.

Afterward, I had clarity. Clarity is an interesting word. It implies some sort of focus or discernment about the reality around you.

I travelled through my life knowing these things:

1. All things are a choice, and all life is experience.
2. All experiences are lessons.
3. Lessons are not about right and wrong, they are about the direction and the choice you continue to take each moment.
4. The only thing that stops your experience of anything is your choice to not experience it at that moment.
5. You are not your thoughts, your feelings, or your body. You are the awareness that those things happen within.

Today, I don't worry very much about what many people do. I know the trajectory of my life because I have chosen it. Months ago, I realized that this trajectory would be better served by moving nearly 1,000 miles from where I was living. I didn't give it much thought, I just chose. I didn't worry too much about where I would live, my job, or so on, because those things will happen. That doesn't mean I didn't look for a job, or explore housing, I simply was not concerned about finding what was right, because I knew what I ended up with would be right. Not because it was determined, but because I chose it.

Meditation is an experience. Nothing more. What it means to you is something no words can ever convey completely. You can only choose to experience it for yourself."	t5_2qnc9	True

When I meditate I picture myself sitting on a rock in the middle of a flowing river. I just try to focus on the flow of the river and keep it calm. As I notice thought entering my mind and disrupting my concentration I turn that thought into a leaf, place it in the river and allow it to flow along. I've found that this has really helped my meditation and is very soothing. Every now and then I had nature sounds as background noise and this adds to the experience. 	t5_2qnc9	True

I typed in 'foggy headed' on google and came across the book [At Last A Life] (http://www.bpt-advocaten.nl/tmp/anxiety.and.panic.free.by.paul.david.pdf) by Paul David. I've gotten a lot out of the book but it has made me question the effect my meditation practice is having on my life. David never mentions meditation but says that self awareness is a principle reasons for detachment: ""Self awareness is a feeling of only being able to think about ourselves to the exclusion of everything else. We are so tuned into ourselves and how we are feeling 24/7, and so self aware, that we find it hard to communicate with others. Everything seems to have closed in on us and we find it hard to concentrate on anything else."" 

I'd love to hear what /r/meditation thinks of this. My link to the PDF of ""At Last A Life"" is above. Chapter 7 covers what I mentioned above. Its very brief but if you don't feel like reading it you should at least check out the section of Chapter 7 titled ""Self Awareness"".

The reason this concerns me is I've noticed my anxiety and ability to cope with stress has increased since I have refined my mindfulness meditation practice (I've been meditating everyday for 5 months. I started  meditating for 25 minutes at least twice a day 1 month ago. Since I stepped things up, I feel like my emotions are magnified and sometimes I feel so depersonalized that my mind comes up with irrational thoughts like ""Did someone drug me"".

**Meditation is elusive.** One minute I'm utterly convinced I have it figured out and possess the ability to deploy a mindful state at will. The next minute I'm sure I totally lost it and forgot ""how"" to do it, and I'm scrambling through one of my books to ""re-learn"" it. I'll also find the perfect phrase that describes meditation and repeat it in my head only to find it totally devoid of power the next day... then I'll find a new phrase that works perfectly, for a bit. My current favorite phrase is ""can you be balanced and in harmony now in this moment?"" I like this one because ""balance"" and ""harmony"" are valueless words (compared to words like ""good,"" ""bad,"" or ""pain."") This reminds me that I'm not supposed to be feeling anything except exactly what I'm feeling right now. I'm not saying the elusiveness of meditation is good or bad, it's just what I've found to be the case.

**Progress in meditation is a paradox.** I feel that my six months of meditation has been life-changing, and yet I also feel that I am nearly the exact same person as I was six months ago. I still like the things I used to like, I still dislike the things I used to dislike, I still yearn and pine away for the same things, and I don't expect meditation to ever change this... what I expect meditation to do is help me accept this changelessness (or the mystery of how to change, or if we even should change) and be aware of it. And what acceptance and awareness does, I think, is throw you a lifesaver during storms of overwhelming emotion. In other words, your extreme feelings of anxiety and depression become dampened and muted, which was exactly my goal in starting meditation. I learned just how much progress I was making a few days ago when I was feeling extremely anxious and enraged... amidst these feelings, I said to myself, WOW, I haven't felt this way in months—I virtually forgot what it feels like to be this anxious and angry... while before I started meditating I would feel this way DAILY. Realizing this absence was a nice feeling.

**My biggest epiphany so far.** With the emphasis on slowing down and observation and 'seeing things how they actually are,' I'm sure we've all had insights and epiphanies. I would say, six months in, my biggest epiphany has been about the huge amount of denial in life and the enormous association between denial and pain. So much of my emotional stress was caused by this denial... denial that what I used to have I no longer have... denial that a person that used to like me now doesn't... denial that I used to have status because of something, and I no longer do... denial that someone I used to love, I no longer love… denial that I have impulses that can be cruel and selfish and narcissistic and other forms of things we're not supposed to be… denial that my life didn't turn out the way I wanted and planned for. Our minds set up these huge barriers of denial and cling to either the past or cling to ideas we hold now that aren't true... because we just can't possibly imagine life being different than our ideal version of it. This is what I mean by denial. And I'll end on this note: I think the biggest and most pain-causing form of denial is the denial that life itself just isn't as pleasurable or beautiful or good as we thought it would be when we were kids, and we are all still in gigantic denial of this. To me, meditation teaches you to accept crushingly boring, tedious, and pleasure-less reality… and this diminishes the pain, so we can have more pockets of joy when they do come.

My pain is slowing staring to go away	midlake500	89	5	12	It's extremely hard for me to give myself permission to just sit still and just my breathing and the sensations. The hardest part is convincing myself that I'm not wasting time. I become anxious almost immediately and my mind starts to think of what I should really be doing. My whole day is like this. I get up in the morning and hurry up and get ready, then I hurry up and drive to work, then I hurry up and work, hurry up drive home, hurry up and eat dinner, hurry up and walk the dogs. I hurry up and do everything, all day, every day. If I don't I feel like I'm wasting time and not being productive. By the end of the night when I'm done with everything and have free time I get very anxious because I have nothing to do. Through meditation I've realized that I'm always rushing, my heart rate is always elevated, and if I'm not rushing through something I feel like I'm wasting time. I don't know why I rush, or why I can't just enjoy myself, but the more I meditate the easier it gets. I've started slowing things down a bit, taking time to enjoy myself. It's because of meditation that I've finally realized this and life has begun to get a lot easier. I never knew that I was in constant pain because of my unjustified compulsion to hurry up and rush through all the things I need to get done in a day.

However, one drawback I've sort of been noticing is, with all this mindfulness and disconnection with thought, I have less opinions and things to say to people. I feel like a big part of conversing is expressing your opinions, desires, likes and dislikes, etc. Mindfulness teaches us to disconnect with these things and realize they are an illusion of the self. So the effect of this for me has been much less opinions to share, and thus I feel somewhat disconnected around some people. There will be rare convo's that I can really get sucked into and be very present, but when it comes to small talk and stuff I don't have much to add.

I want to clear my mind of all of the toxic I’ve manifested over the last 24 years. 

I am constantly agitated, worried and stressed about my life, but I’m too lazy and procrastinate too much to do anything about it. I want to be able to relax and mediate and take a middle path to everything and create a new attitude for myself based on balance love and compassion.

I get angry about the most trivial things and it sometimes I feel like it complete dominates my life. In addition to this, I have little to no empathy for other people or their problems. I’m rude and a smartass and generally think I’m better than poorer or less educated people. In essence, I’m a dreadfully miserable asshole and I want help. 
I think part of my anger is when people do things that violate my own personal code which is asinine because how are they supposed to know what the fuck I think is appropriate? I also can’t tolerate people who I feel like are less intelligent than me, nor can I tolerate people who I know are smarter than me. I like to pretend I’m smarter than I am in front of people who I would shit on verbally if they tried to object or call me wrong.  I surround myself with ignorance to make myself feel better, and then I get angry when I can’t comprehend or anticipate the depth of the stupidity.

Here’s what confuses me about myself: I’ve watched documentaries that have made me almost feel empathetic, but I have never altered my lifestyle or donated money to anything. How can I almost cry about something in a film, but not give a shit about something in real life? 

Another example is I have misogynist thoughts and attitudes at times. Sometimes I feel like I have hatred for women because I find the stereotypical hobbies and interests to be beyond useless. It gets me mad to even think about teenage girl’s spending money on bullshit. Then I realize that not all girls/females/women are the same, and I make exceptions in my mind. Perhaps I’m not articulating this well enough, but it’s like I believe girls are equal to men, unless they’re not? Does this make sense? Then I have the audacity to label myself a pro-feminist male, and chastise others for doing the same shit that I do in my head.

I have the same faults that I abhor in other people.  How can this be? Is it because I spent so much of my childhood lying that I just started lying to myself? I can actually force myself to believe a lie. I don’t want to self-impose a pathological liar diagnosis on myself, but I’ve told lies so often they have just become the truth. I’m engaged to a women who I’m a crazy about (or maybe just makes me crazy), and yet sometimes I lie to her about nonsense. Why do I do this? I believe that care about her. I tend to put her needs and wants above my own, but not all the time. On several occasions I’ve ruined her day/night/plans with my selfishness and sour attitude.  On reflection I’ve always been able to identify the things I did/said wrong but I keep making the same mistakes over and over. 

This ended up being a giant ramble but I hope it’s concise in its theme. I don’t understand how I evolved into a terrible person but I desperately want to change my outlook and hopefully my life

It would be nice if the meditation subreddit could exist for those of us that want to discuss our interest (meditation) without having to sift through a weekly crop of posts on ""I meditated on ____, look at me!""

I'll admit that I'm a little biased. I don't like drug culture, and I don't enjoy seeing them promoted. Don't get me wrong... I don't mind that places for people with that interest exist. People get to do what they want with their own lives. I'm sure I do things that bother them too. 

But this is a meditation reddit. Not a drug use reddit. ~~So it bothers me to see it posted and tolerated here: both for personal reasons, and because many practices of meditation regard drugs as a false path at best.~~ 

~~Even putting that aside for a moment... these vast majority of such posts just... aren't about meditation. They're about the drugs. You don't need to meditate on mind-altering substances to have an altered experience. Posting ""Hey I meditated on drugs, it was cool, I felt really relaxed/transcendental/buzzword"" just doesn't contribute anything here.~~ These lines struckthrough because of points some people raised. See edit below. 

And I think we're just all a little tired of this same discussion happening in every single post. To me, it seems like the most appropriate thing would be to just gently recommend more suitable pages for people with these interests.  

Or maybe people like me are the minority. In which case, can we be up-front about what this community is ""for"" on our rules page?

**EDIT: I'M PROBABLY WRONG. I have no answers to valid points some people raised.**

A few people have raised the interesting point that this opens the door to needing to police every controversial topic, which is something I hadn't considered. Also, it has been noted that we set out to be welcoming of all meditation practice, not specific traditions. I must admit that there may be traditions in which drug use is a welcomed part of the exploration. My wording along those lines may have also been quite poor, and not fully separated the point I was trying to make and my own biases. So I apologize for that.  

I have no answers to these (and other) good points raised in disagreement with me. So I must withdraw the request. "	t5_2qnc9	True

1359369198.0	17f8hg	"Did I briefly experience ""nirvana""?"	fdtm	103	28	46	"**TL;DR** - *It seems through mindfulness meditation I achieved a state of hyper-awareness, almost complete loss of ego, and extremely pleasant feeling of well being and harmony. Below I describe the experience.*

I've been practicing my own type of ""meditation"" sporadically (every week or so) for the past few months, but not as regularly as I should so I'm still a beginner at this. For some reason I've been pretty much drawn to things like meditation (accessing subconscious, increasing awareness, etc.) since a child (I don't know why), but I never really motivated myself to really try it seriously until recently.

So recently I've achieved a few very interesting effects over these past few months. These are all quite ""real"" in the sense that they're perceptual shifts, and not just minor/placebo ones. To be honest I wasn't really expecting that meditation would have such a tangible change in perception and increase in well being, so this is kind of surprising development since I started a few months ago.

Note two things: (1) I am not religious, although the experiences here may sound ""mystical"". I believe the human mind is simply capable of far more than we give it credit, but we rarely access its full potential. (2) The experiences described here all result from completely natural meditation; absolutely no substances or medication or anything is involved here.

* I am able to remember almost perfectly now, with enough effort, any event in my life. I have remembered successfully and confirmed specific objects from when I was less than two years old.

* For brief moments, I've achieved a state where I'm almost hyper-aware of my environment. My perception shifts not to viewing out through a peephole of eyes, but a whole view of everything around me. I simultaneously perceive the motion and actions of everyone around me, with imagination and intuition greatly enhanced.

* This hyper aware state continues to even greater degrees, where everything seems amazingly indescribably beautiful. But the most astonishing part isn't even the beauty or pleasant feeling, but the shift in perception away from the 'normal' ""peering out through peepholes in our head"" feel.

The last bullet point mentioned is the strangest of all, and it only occurs rarely. It seems difficult to maintain this mental state, as though it comes in waves, here for a while, then it slips away. However it's as though the waves are coming more frequently and more powerfully recently. The most recent event (as of about a month ago) is this:

I was sitting outside just meditating with eyes open. I suddenly realized a strange mental shift. I had attained this state by meditating on the concept ""watch"" (""watch my thoughts. watch my senses. do not analyze. just watch."") Like the second bullet point above, I rapidly entered this hyper aware state. More than that though, my awareness shifted almost out of body (but not really - not so much out of body, as away from the concept of body ever being distinct at all). I realized I was hungry, so I started walking to a food place nearby (this is in the city).

As I was walking down the sidewalk, I realized a very strange sensation. Everything looked strange, as though I was both seeing it for the first time as it ""truly is"". Colors extremely vivid, smells powerfully unique and amazing, all sensations seemed wonderful and yet, I felt no need to grin or anything. I just experienced, perceived, with any identifiable ""flow"" of thoughts no longer existing as such. I just ""was"". My thoughts were one. There was no distinct flow or order or sequence or routine or method. Just thought. It's a sensation that of pure genuine awareness and coexistent co-experiencing and one-ness with reality that is the most full form of ""well being"" I can describe.

In a way, my mind was constantly aware of a million thoughts at once, all as one. For example: For every car that passed by, my mind was aware that the driver was most likely staring intently at the road, but not fully present. The drivers are lost in their heads, thinking ""I have to get to the store, buy milk, then drive home. Then I'll ..."". It was as though the people all around me were living a life in programmed slots, enslaved to their routine. Every day we go about our jobs and ignore all the amazing sights, sounds, etc. around us because we're too busy trapped in our minds and our constructed realities, value systems, and rule systems so far that the cultural fiction of what's important becomes our reality, replacing everything else. All this paragraph is an example of a thought that would occur to me in a millisecond, for a single object.

While waiting for dinner to arrive, my perception continued to approach whatever direction it was approaching. When it grew, it got even weirder. My sense of self was slipping away. Before my perception was grown, but now my ""ego"" or sense of ""me"" was beginning to dissolve. This became slightly scary, but I tried to just continue the theme of ""just watch, don't analyze/try"". 

I could perceive the individual motions of each hair on my hand and head/neck. I realized that every time I breathe, my hands feel a draft from the breath that I never before noticed because I had grown accustomed to ignoring it my entire life. My sense of hearing was greatly magnified, hearing many conversations around me all distinct at once. I could feel my internal organs, heartbeat, all at once. I was sitting at the table, staring blankly out, motionless. At this moment, I could ""feel"" (empathy) more tangibly the behavior and emotional state of people around me more than I ever have in my life. And yet my emotions were no longer really human in the sense that the animal emotions dissolve away along with the ego. Only the more powerful/profound emotions/feelings remained; love, amazement, well-being, empathy, compassion, etc. Sadness left with the ego, and was no longer in the realm of possibility.

Then, my dinner arrived. Unfortunately this had the effect of partially snapping me out of the state. I didn't leave it entirely, but it stopped continuing and slowly reversed to ""normal"". So the ""ego death"" or whatever didn't complete as I was distracted, but it was very interesting (if not slightly terrifying). The state still lingered, and while I ate at this place many times before, that still was the best tasting meal I had in my life. To provide basis for comparison: the pleasure enhancing effect this meditation had on senses (like taste) was *vastly* beyond Marijuana for example (though I've only tried it once before so this comparison is based on memory), but also quite different obviously as this state was one of hyper awareness.

I can't really describe it very well though. This is only an attempt to explain a wordless experience with words. I am not very well educated on meditation etc., so I don't know if there's a common name for this kind of experience. The closest thing in popular culture I could associate is ""Nirvana"", but it's usually joked about as some unattainable myth. 

All I know is this state was certainly pleasant through most of it. I'm sure with practice I can achieve it again - but it does seem these things come in ""waves"" I suppose as my mind learns how to maintain a certain state better over time."	t5_2qnc9	True

1337266865.0	trprt	What are the dangers of meditation? (See text)	gekogekogeko	80	7	91	"A couple years ago a friend of mine took her own life after a silent meditation retreat in India. She hadn't had a lot of experience meditating before then, but had dabbled in yoga for years.  The strange thing about her suicide was that it wasn't out of depression, but because she thought she was on the verge of enlightenment and she needed to leave her body to achieve liberation. One of the last things that she wrote in her journal was ""I am a Bodhisattva""

I'm working on a book that deals with her death, and the deaths and psychosis that I've occasionally seen among other meditators, but I was wondering if people here had come across similar stories? Or known someone for whom meditation led them down a dangerous path.

For most people meditation is a completely foreign experience. Time passes quickly, or incredibly slowly, if you close your eyes you often see colors, and often times people see walls ""breathe"". These are normal experiences. However, some people can take them to mean they are going through a profound change. Maybe they think it is a sign of their own special powers, or that they are enlightened.  When that is coupled with intense guided visualizations who knows where some people will take it.  

So I want to know what people here think about these potential dangers. What have you seen along these lines in your experience? Where should I look to find out more information? 

**EDIT/UPDATE May 25, 2012:** *Thanks for your comments on this everyone , I appreciate everyone's responses. The general consensus here is that meditation has a myriad of positive effects, there are occasionally problems for folks who have pre-existing issues of various sorts. A few people have noted that ""difficulties"", does not always mean ""danger""  and people are sympathetic to the death of my friend. There has also been some reference to the work of a few neuroscientists attempting to empirically study the issue.* 

*Several people have taken issue with the phrase ""dangers of meditation"", saying that the title suggests that I have implicitly stated that all meditation is inherently harmful. This was not my intention.*  

*This has been very informative and I appreciate your time and thoughts*"	t5_2qnc9	True

1363223362.0	1a973v	For those of us who find difficulty in quieting our mind.	JordanMacPhee	87	15	15	"I'm not new to meditation, but I have fallen out of practice for a long time. After reading a small book by the Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh called ""True Love: A Practice for Awakening the Heart"", though, I've decided to begin again. Since I feel like this is essentially starting anew again, following my returning session now, I thought it would be helpful to write this to those of us who find difficulty in quieting our restless mind, especially those who are new to meditation or are considering returning to meditation after a long absence.

As I sat breathing with my eyes closed, I began meditating on these words (taken loosely from the book I just mentioned): 

*While inhaling, ""Breathe... I am breathing in."" And while exhaling, ""Breathe... I am breathing out.""* 

As soon as I began, I realized how unquiet, restless, and out of my control my mind was. I could hardly keep mindful attention and awareness on my breathing without thinking about the dozens, or hundreds, of possible other things I could be thinking or doing. 

After a minute or two, I noticed a small clock ticking, and I couldn't help but be distracted by it, so I took it off the hook on the wall, set it in my bedroom where I wouldn't be able to hear it, and returned to meditating.

Several minutes in, many times, while my mind wandered, I caught myself thinking, ""Breathe... I am breathing out,"" when I was actually breathing in! I realized I was merely trying to memorize the words without actually paying attention to what I was doing and thinking.

After about 10 minutes, this happened less and less, and I began to regain control of my mind, and become more aware of what I was thinking and doing. 

After 15 minutes had passed, I could notice when my mind was beginning to wander, acknowledge this lapse in concentration, let the absent thought float away, and return to focusing on my breathing.

After 20 minutes, I was almost completely absorbed, in thought and action, on the words, ""Breathe... I am breathing in. Breathe... I am breathing out,"" and I ended my session there.

I probably have a lot more progress to make in the coming days, or perhaps even weeks, before I can readily sit down and immediately become as absorbed in concentration as I did at the tale end of my session. 

When I feel my mind beginning to wander, I am going to remember to acknowledge the lapse in concentration, allow the absent thought to float away, and return to meditating on my breathing.

Another note: Early on, I noticed that there were times where I became discouraged at my inability to control my focus, so I started to tell myself, ""You aren't doing well. Do better!"" Also, later on, there were times where I became proud at my progress and my ability to maintain focus, so I started to tell myself, ""Well done! You're focusing so well."" You can see the irony in this. By taking my focus off of my breathing, and beginning to focus on whether or not I was ""doing well"", I distracted myself so that focus was impossible! 

It is useless to discourage or congratulate oneself. All that matters is to remain focused on one's breathing and the accompanying words, ""Breathe... I am breathing in. Breathe... I am breathing out."""	t5_2qnc9	True

It's just a few simple exercises to wake up the body before I go and wake up my mind by meditating. Well, today while meditating, I feel as though I stumbled upon the craziest bit of insight in a long time.

I have a little balcony on which I can sit on a bamboo mat partially in the sun; today, as I was entering my tiny 10'x3' balcony and grabbing my bamboo mat, I noticed a wasp peeking it's head out into the sun from an old satellite dish that had a small wasp nest in it.

I thought to myself  
""What good does a wasp do?  

Then I unrolled my mat, sat down, then began my meditation. As I started focusing my breathing, I started having trouble maintaining focus so I turned my attention to my hearing. I promptly heard the buzzing of the wasps, so I thought to myself again;  

What good does a wasp do?  

Then something odd happened.

I started thinking, but this time, about nature and how the most successful organisms in nature are the ones that form relationships and that humans are part of that rule. That humans are the only animals that we know of on this planet who can communicate anything, to anyone, anywhere. From the simplest message of ""Hello!"" to complex ideas, such as quantum physics. Neither distance nor time can conquer our ideas and that our ideas are part of something we should cherish. Our ideas play a part in our hopes and dreams; future endeavors and blissful aspirations. And again, we are the only animals who can do that; dream about flying a mile in the sky, rocketing to the stars, bringing people back from the brink of death, teaching the tools that future generations will improve upon, and much, much more. And we humans have ""cheated the system"" (if you believe in evolution). That those of us with physical disabilities; nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, diabetes, heart disease, amputations, etc. would be at a natural disadvantage, now have the ability to live as long as anyone else where as if those of us who do have disabilities lived a couple hundred years ago, we'd be dead before you know it.

Death.

Just then, I heard a buzz. Then a slight thud. Odd how things happen sometimes.

As I returned from my tangent, I bowed my head. I don't know why. It was just a wasp; but then I realized it. All life is meaningful. That wasp had a job to do in its hive; from tending to the young to providing security. I'll never know what it was supposed to do, I just hope that it did it to the best of its ability because...life is short and life is expendable. It doesn't take much to end a life; but it sure has hell takes a lot of magic to get it started and keep it running. From the complex synapses, electrical charges, and balance of chemicals in our brains that create our consciousness, personalities, memories, and how we experience, react, perceive, remember, and communicate with in the outside world; to the mitochondrial level and the most basic of the basic energy production, the electron transport chain. Life is a fucking miracle man. It's a damn wonder that anything works. And somehow, we can recreate it. Complex gestures and ideas and be recreated on computers; something we developed and we conceptualized, designed, developed, produced, and improved upon to incomprehensible levels when they were first thought of, in the matter half a century where as mother nature took thousands, if not millions of years, to get us to where we are now.

And that all these technologies we've made are tools and something that should not be abused; guns, computers/internet, drugs, etc. That the problem most of the time boils down to one thing: not knowing. Not knowing what they meant, not knowing how to react, not knowing why, not knowing who, and a multitude of other reasons to be lacking the knowledge you seek.

Some such practices that I have an appreciation for and a desire to learn from are the different forms of Eastern meditation. Unfortunately, most Christian authorities hold that Christian prayer and Zazen mediation (for example) are like apples and oranges and cannot mix. Their main argument is that sin is something that only Christ can control and take away, not something that can be controlled by our own hands (by meditating).

My point of concern:

I want to find the tranquility that meditation offers, but I want Christ to be at the center. Any ideas?

1316507900.0	klexj	Everyday awareness tips and tricks		84	11	15	"Hi there fellow meditators!

I´ve been meditating (almost) daily since maybe a month, though I´ve been interesting in the concept of ""awareness"" for much longer. While I really enjoy intense sitting practice, I believe that practicing awareness in my day-to-day life is certainly as much, if not more important to my personal mental state, so I thought I´d share my experiences in that field with you and to hear if some of you have some little techniques of your own. My way of looking at meditation and awareness has been shaped a lot by ""Whereever You Go, There You Are"" by Jon Kabat-Zinn, with his very simple lay way of talking about these concepts.

So here it goes:

---

**Cutting out selfmade noise**

I´ve always been very used to always have something blasting in my ear, and that increased when very small, lightweight mp3-players hit the market (first the iPod Shuffle, then the Sansa Clip). I was listening to EVERYTHING - music, podcasts (didn´t really matter what kind, I somehow got stuck on tech podcasts, mostly because the topics were kinda repetetive but I got so used to the hosts voices), audiobooks, whatever.

I simply felt that if I didn´t have something blabbering in my ears I would somehow faint and fall over from instant boredom. Ever since I started to live my daily live with more awareness I noticed that not only I don´t become bored that easily - there really is always something going on, if you really open your senses! - but that this constant stream of noise really dragged down my concentration.

I ride the subway quite a lot during the week, and the first few times when I left my player at home were an interesting experience. ""Oh, but I will get SO BORED! And people talk such dumb stuff on the train all the time!"" I always have a book with me but nowadays I find that I don´t even get it out to read it - I just sit there in an upright position, focus on my body and my breath, and suddenly taking the train becomes a breeze.

Oh, and these days I really appreciate music and good podcasts, simply because I don´t have them on *all the time*. 

---

**What´s that thing?**

Especially early in the morning my thoughts tend to race in all directions. I´ve bought an iPod Touch earlier this year and it has become a bad habit to check my emails, my websites or Reddit first thing after waking up.

So when I´m in the kitchen fixing my breakfast and being generally a bit grumpy I try to pay attention to stuff I´ve never noticed before. For instance how the light falling through the windows on any particular morning looks. Or how the brown bubbles on the black grain coffee* form very funny shapes - sometimes I spend a few moments blowing them around in my mug. Or how my feet feel on the floor.

When I leave the house I try to really look at little details - the funny pattern on the floor tiles which I just recently really noticed for the very first time. The odd pipes that run along the ceiling. All this are things I have completely missed all these years I´ve been living here!

(*Grain coffee because real coffee makes me either fly off the handle or jittery and anxious, both states I actively try to avoid.)


---

**Speeding up by slowing down**

Ever noticed that the faster you do things the more likely you are to not do them right? I run from the bathroom into the kitchen and already forgot what I was meaning to do. Or I still have wet hair but already am checking my email and getting the keyboard wet, so I have to dry the keyboard, still with wet hair, and then I get cold because I´ve been running around shirtless for half an hour, and still haven´t brushed my teeth.

So now I´m trying to actually do things in order: Take a shower, dry my hair, brush my teeth and get dressed, everything in a nice controlled flow without running to my computer with my toothbrush in my mouth. This means I get ready to go outside *a lot* faster than I used to. I even sometimes catch myself thinking ""oh shit, it´s so late already, I need to... oh wait, I already did that"".

My head isn´t going to explode if I take a few moments more to fix my breakfast, and I found that my mind doesn´t automatically shut down if I stand in place for the few minutes I brush my teeth instead of racing around my apartement.

...

So these are a few little habits I´m trying to cultivate. Do you have your own habits like that as well?"	t5_2qnc9	True

I'll be going to a music festival tomorrow and I feel a mixed range of intense emotions. For some reason I'm feeling like being surrounded by that many people will be stressful for me as I can tend to be introverted and value my own time. Just wondering if there's any type of meditation that will help with enjoying the experience as much as possible. 

Side question: I've recently been told by one of my friends that before each meditation session you should have a goal in mind of what you're trying to achieve. Is this true? I've simply been following my breath and trying to keep focusing back to it while simply watching things happen.

Fizkizzle	95	21	20	"I recently posted a [trick](http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1iayqq/i_found_a_trick_to_get_myself_to_meditate_every/) for when I feel resistance to sitting.

The rule: **I wake up at a set time every morning and immediately meditate, before doing anything else.** If I wake up late or do anything else first -- breakfast, a workout, checking my phone -- I have trouble getting myself to sit. But when I follow this rule, it's almost effortless. Not sure why, but that's how it is.

I have been meditating roughly once a day for the past 2 months or so, and recently I've begun feeling that things I spent a lot of time doing earlier aren't that important to me.

One of those things was playing video games at a somewhat competetive level, with the purpose of getting proffesional at it. After meditating my focus has shifted more towards the moment, and I've realised that a lot of the time I'm playing, I am not really having fun, and thus I have begun questioning whether it's a thing I want to spend time at, gradually playing less and less.

However now that I don't play as much, I have a big blob of time in my everyday that I'm not certain what to do with. Have you experienced similar things happening or do you have an idea on how to find a new direction?

I grew up not really knowing much about meditation, so when I heard people mention it, I never knew quite what to think. Maybe that they were a hippie, buddhist, or both. It always seemed like something I'd never really bother with. Then I heard a friend mention that Steve Jobs had found meditation to be a far more heady, trippy experience than any drug he had ever tried.
 
Curious, I started meditating nightly, for around 20 or 30 minutes before bed. Recently, I've begun experiencing powerful visual hallcunations around the 15-20 minute mark.
I never even thought this was possible. Do other people who meditate experience these effects?
 
A little more about the technique I'm using, just in case you're curious:
I usually listen to the album ""76:14"" by Global Communication, turned down low. I play tracks 2, 3, and 4, and by track 4, I begin experiencing hardcore visuals (track 4, 9:39 is especially trippy). I make sure my room is clean and quiet, and lay down on my back. I find my back works best, as it is comfortable, and I am usually unable to fall asleep while laying on my back.
 
Next, I relax all of the muscles in my body, and try to remain absolutely motionless. I then gradually reduce my mental activity and clear all of the thoughts from my mind. I focus on only my deep breathing, and feel as though the music is doing the thinking for me. This was particularly difficult when I first began, but somehow, it has gotten much easier to focus on absolutely nothing. If the occasional thought does crop up, I gently let it pass by, without paying it any attention.
 
Eventually, my entire body feels like it melts away, as though I'm connected to everything (yeah, the old cliche of being ""one with everything""). It's at this point when intense euphoria and relaxation sets in, and I begin to experience the visuals. Mostly grand, sweeping colors and cosmic imagery. Time completely stops, and I rest for what feels like an eternity. As track 4 ends, I am reminded that my time is up, and I slowly drift back to reality.
 
What I've noticed is that I now feel much happier every day. I tend to notice natural beauty (trees, flowers, the sky, clouds) more often, and they feel infinitely more valuable (ugh, probably turning into a hippie). And the sleep I receive after meditating is some of the best, most restful sleep I've ever experienced.
 
Has anyone else experienced these same things? Is there any scientific validity to any of this, or am I just on a giant placebo trip?
 
**EDIT:** I Also wanted to mention, my ability to focus at work has vastly improved, and my breathing has become much more full and stable while I run.  It's like a giant epiphany - suddenly, all of these things I've heard about meditation throughout my life make sense."	t5_2qnc9	True
1375550354.0	1jmub8	Controlled happiness	Muox	81	15	14	"I have just meditated for a little over a week, but I have started to feel the benefits of the practice already, and one very special benefit I recently have noticed is more stable mood. 

A very important truth has been 'revealed' to me lately, and that is that unhappiness is just about not being in the present. Most of the problems you ever had, you have made problems yourself, with your mind. You created these problems by not being present, and you continue living them out in your head, and by continuing being lost in thought all the time, you just nourish the problems and make them grow, without even being aware of it - because you're just that; you're never aware. 

This had became an evil circle for me, and meditation is an escape out of this circle and as long as you stay aware, I feel like you never have to go back.

But what I also feel, is that extreme happiness also can come from being lost in thought, and that probably explains why I've always had these moodswings. This dreaming caused great suffering, but could also be something I could use for extreme happiness. 

After meditating, I feel like my mood is more stable, and I have sustainable, long lasting happiness. The awareness has taken away the extreme happiness - that 'evil' kind of happiness, that had depression as its baggage. True happiness lies in the presence. "	t5_2qnc9	True

Probably_Nonsense	77	6	13	"A bit of background: since I started, my big reasons for meditation have been focus and concentration. I've mostly done informal meditation but I took a class once and the instructor mentioned the problem of the ""monkey mind"" i believe. Basically, the whole wandering mind and unwanted mental chatter thing, which really got my attention. 

Anyway, I've recently found that whenever my mind begins to wander, it helps a lot to stop myself by saying ""I already know the rest of what my mind is beginning to say. I don't need to finish it.""(i.e., if I start to think about a list of things I have to do, I already know about the things that my mind is going to use to make the list)

 My logic is that if you're not thinking critically or trying to analyze something, you tend to plan what you're going to say and think before you actually get around to doing it. So far it seems to be really helpful for maintaining my focus and avoiding distraction, even outside of meditation.

----------------------------------

The purpose of meditation is to form a very valuable habit.  The habit of: 

1) Being aware of your thoughts as they happen, 
2) Understanding why you had that particular thought and 
3) Then being able to refocus on what deserves your attention in the present moment.  

In this way we are able to recognize our thoughts and deal with them before they turn into trails of though which pull us into the past or future and away from the present moment.

To put it another way, as you are meditating do not simply ignore all thoughts by focusing on your breath (this is what many beginners do).

Begin by focusing on your breath.  As the inevitable thoughts come into mind, acknowledge them, think about why that particular thought came up and then refocus on your breath.  

Essentially you are practicing the habit of though recognition (acknowledging the thought), self awareness (understanding why you had the thought) and then refocusing (being in the present).  

By doing this you are practicing the habit of being in the moment.  

Also by taking a moment to understand why you had the thought you are teaching yourself that you are not your thoughts--They may arise for a logical reason, but buy understanding why they arose, you learn that you are not them.

For example, say I'm breathing and a friend pops into my head.  I start to feel a little guilty that I have not communicated with them in a while.  Left to fester, worry and anxiety may start to set in over this thought.  

During meditation I recognize this thought, think about why it popped into my head (this is a very important step because it allows you to see that you are not your thoughts.  If instead you ignore this step and guilt and anxiety set in over it you will begin to feel like you are the person who SHOULD feel guilt and anxiety because of the situation) and then return to the focus on my breath.  Essentially you are training yourself to let go of thought trails and stay in the present.

Habit rules our lives.  Through the practical methods of thought awareness, thought recognition (why the thought popped up) and refocusing on the present, meditation teaches you the habit of being in the moment.

1364199291.0	1aypeo	"Biases of ""secular"" meditation"		89	22	61	"Here's a comment I wrote on another forum as a response to a question about benefits derived from meditation. What do you think?

----

I've been meditating about twice daily (15-30 minutes) for about two years, and more sporadically for a year before that. I started because I was feeling really confused and anxious and desperate about stuff in general, and needed some kind of anchor or Regular Good Thing in my life. I could go on and on about the various benefits and so on, but I've rarely found that type of thing very interesting to read about myself, so...

Here's a thought. There's a bias in the current ""secular"" discourse about meditation, probably inherited from the psychiatric perspective of the ""mindfulness"" movement. Let's call it the emotional bias. The whole discussion seems to revolve around ""emotional benefits."" This might seem like a natural given, but let's question it.

Just to shake things up a bit, let's compare meditation to some other activity. Say, reading. It would be weird to talk about reading only in terms of ""emotional benefits."" Like, ""I read twice a day and I have found that it gives me a noticable increase in feelings of joy and wellbeing."" You would say, ""okay, but what are you reading? Is it interesting? What have you learned?"" Of course meditation and reading are not the same thing, but I just want to point out that it's not immediately obvious that everything people do intentionally is for ""emotional benefits.""

For me, while I do appreciate emotional benefits, the fascination of meditation for me is more cognitive. It's almost like a puzzle. I can't really explain it. It's not clear what the puzzle is about, but if I had to say something, I'd say it has a lot to do with the relationship between myself and ""phenomena."" Maybe between my mind as such and its specific manifestations -- I'm aware this might sound pretty crazy. It has to do with figuring out (or penetrating or unravelling or getting to the bottom of) some kind of fundamental confusion.

So, I'm not very impressed by the dogmatic version of secular meditation. I caricaturize this dogma as saying ""meditation is purely a technique for improving your emotional life and your career performance, anything else is religious woo-woo bullshit nonsense."" It's such a cocky attitude. ""Alright religious people, you've been messing around with this stuff for thousands of years, now we'll take over, throw out the weird stuff and do it properly."""	t5_2qnc9	True

I am new to meditation, having been practicing for about a week for the usual reasons...mind always running, intrusive thoughts, issues focusing, etc. My practice has been rocky but I am committed to continue.

Last night I was laying in bed trying to fall asleep and my mind was racing so I decided to start focusing on my breathing. Something amazing ""clicked"" after a few minutes; whether it was because my mindset was different because I hadn't sat down with the goal of meditating, or I was tired and trying to fall asleep, I don't know. But all of a sudden, my body felt so unbelievably small and mind felt so unbelievably large. I felt like I was looking at myself floating through space. I was able to focus intently on a single thought, or think about nothing at all as I ""watched"" myself. I don't know how else to explain it. I wouldn't say it's the first time something like this has happened, but it's the first time I really acknowledged it and delved ""deeper"".

Anyway, I woke up this morning and pondered the experience, and something one of my buddies told me came back to me regarding meditation, yoga, and general mental well-being: perhaps it is wrong to go into any sort of practice looking to ""fix"" something, because you'll always be in the mind set of expecting some sort of result. You do it because it's healthy and in the long run it will be beneficial for your mind. I believe this concept manifested itself last night. Every time so far I've sat down to meditate, I've been in the mind frame of ""Ok odoyle489, don't attach to thoughts, don't linger, focus on your breath, let thoughts flow through you, relax yourself""...my mind was racing attempting to get my mind to stop racing! However last night, I was relaxing for the sake of relaxing, trying to fall asleep, and I reached a level of mental clarity that I'd never reached before with focused effort.

So, I am no expert on any of this, perhaps I was just tired and my mind was shutting off, I don't know, but perhaps the one thing I'm going to take away from this experience is to not be too hard on myself. I need to stop ""trying"" to be mindful, and just ""be"" mindful.

Sorry if this is redundant or obvious to others more experienced, but I am just reflecting :)

Has anyone else had a similar experience to this?

The game takes place inside of a meditation, I've chosen to use this monk character to represent my inner consciousness. The person who explores my thoughts and decides what to do when I come across them. The entire game is mean to be a reflection of a meditative practice that I've learned, practiced and used to overcome various struggles in my life, including depression. It's my intent to convey a simple message to the player:

You get what you give yourself. If you can look at yourself calmly, clearly and honestly with compassion and love for yourself, you can heal what troubles you, however if you add anger, hate and fight who you are and what you feel, you'll only end up hurting yourself more. Basically I use meditation to get into a calm state and give myself as much love as possible, while facing who I am truthfully in order to remove ""issues"" from my personality, and that's what I want to reflect in the game.

Well one of my favorite meditation techniques is the ""Loving Kindness"" meditation. In this meditation you start off sending love to someone you love, you then imagine them sending love back to you, you then send love to yourself, and then to others you love, and then others you have difficulties with. By the end of the meditation you are sending love to every corner of the planet.


I want more compassion in my life because I find the more love I am radiating out the happier I am. So I give my love to strangers at the gym etc, today however, I read a story about a man who might get the death penalty for raping a newborn infant. 

I felt nothing but rage at this man. For me the death penalty would be letting him off easy. I wanted to see him tortured, hurt. I was angry and disgusted. 

I then realized that this is a person that I am incapable of showing compassion to. I have been able in the past, during loving kindness meditation to show compassion and love to murderers, and I even worked my way up to molesters. But something about this man just repels me to my core. 

How would the Dalai Lama or any of you show compassion or love to someone like this? Is it possible? Is it even worth attempting? Is their any benefit to trying to send love or compassion to someone like this after destroying the life of an infant in the  most horrific way possible? Is there anything at the core of this person that is pure or worth saving or are there people out there who are the epitome of evil? Evil incarnate? 

I would like to increase my compassion and love for people, even those who have done wrong because I find that many times they are victims of circumstance and I can find a way to pity them, which is a low form of love but it's a start. I cannot even pity this man he just repels me to my core. 

Would any of you who practice loving kindness extend love to this person? How?

But at the same time, I have to be careful not to pull myself into the thought process. The key is to let the mind settle on its own simply by watching patiently with detached awareness - no force.

Turiya suggested we continue the discussion based on [this bit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/hyj17/new_to_meditationsome_basic_questions/c1zubra).

In mindfulness meditation, the role is quite clear - thoughts are ok, but you should observe them rather than participate in them. Turiya and I differed on whether or not that really is ""thinking"" as such, or a distinct process (since you're not following the thoughts, but just letting them dissipate - or aim to anyway).

Other forms explicitly incorporate structured contemplation on something (e.g. Zen riddles; or many religious practices involving contemplation on religious ideals) whether as a tool or as a goal in itself.

Some aim at clearing the mind of all thought and maintaining strict concentration.

It'd be interesting to see what people here think about how thoughts and thinking fit into your various practices.

Why? There's a lot of reasons.

Being an anxious person, I was promised great relief from anxiety, new appreciation for life, great ""insights"" that will keep me coming back for more, etc. and etc. Maybe I was foolish to believe that, but hey, that's how meditation is pushed over in the Western world.

So what happened?

I'm not really sure. Been meditating for six months now. When I started, yeah, I definitely felt much better. A clearer head, more focus, even some ""insights"" that helped me to work on inner blocks that I wasn't letting go of. It was great! Upon finding this subreddit, I felt like I made some great leaps and bounds in my practice. I learned to expect nothing; to be nothing, all that jazz. Good times.

But recently, that hasn't been happening anymore. I'm angry. I'm irritable. I'm more in my head than ever before. I've been getting fleeting suicidal thoughts, and frankly, that's terrifying. I increased my practice time to 15 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes at night; I felt better for about a week.

I know meditation is all about sitting with these emotions and thoughts, but honestly, what the hell? How do you sit with suicidal thoughts? How do you just ""be"" so angry that you want to smash a goddamn mirror? I don't understand it!

The only ""insights"" that I've gotten in the past month have been negative: I'm a shitty guitarist, shitty DJ, shitty music producer, ridiculously weak student, shitty son, and pathetic person in general.

Everybody says ""Get a teacher!"" Unfortunately, that's not an option where I'm from. Meditation is one of these things that most people know about but nobody gives a shit about enough to actually start something with it. I can't help but feel that getting a teacher on Skype or something like that would be somewhat hopeless. I wouldn't even know the first place to go looking for something like that. I'm so goddamn frustrated with all this.

So yeah, I'm tired of expecting nothing, and trying to be nothing. Meditation, regardless of whether or not it's actually making me feel like shit, or I'm becoming more aware of the fact that I've always felt like shit, has got to either stop I need to get some serious help. I think I'm falling into one of these dangerous unguided practice traps, and I don't know what else to do.

1350047573.0	11d3qu	I've been meditating for 3 months now and became severly depressed for the first time in my life. Any advice?	biggusdiggus	66	9	88	"So I don't really know what to do now.
I discovered Meditation 3 months ago in ""The Happiness Hypothesis"" and meditated since then for up to an hour per day. (concentrating on breath as described in Minfullness in Plain English)

Today I finally admitted to myself that I'm severly depressed: no motivation to do anything , no intereset in social interactions, no friends, no perspective, crying attacks and so on. (since a month ca.)

Has anyone of you experienced this? Will it get better at some point or sould I stop meditating and seek medical help instead?

I'm quite confused now, because I started meditating to be more content, live my life fuller and in the end, to become a happier person.
Why did the extreme opposite happen?

I'll be grateful for every response,
Thanks

1373169499.0	1hsb3o	Sensory Deprivation Tank Experience	WonderExplorer	70	12	25	"My second time in the tank was all I was hoping the 1st time would be. I was well rested and even had 1/2 of a 5 hour energy drink to ensure I didn’t fall asleep. This session was 2 hours, so I didn’t have to worry about running out of time. Everything came to a stop and I was able to clear my mind completely. Some of what I thought and experienced was a little on the weird side, but I’m going to try and describe it the best I can.



The first 10-20 minutes (again, time’s different in there) I used to try and clear my mind of all thought. That sensation alone was worth the time and money spent experiencing this. Once I realized my mind was clear, I had to clear my mind again because that realization put something else into my mind. It is much easier to get back to clarity once you achieve it though, and the aid of the tank’s deprivation of sensations makes it even more achievable.

At that point, I was able to bring thoughts and situations into my consciousness in isolation and consider them at what I would call an extremely slowed down and methodical pace. There were a few things I went through that I’ll share here and a few things that are personal (but every bit as meaningful in the experience.) I’m kind of putting myself out there in writing about this, but here goes.

The first thing I chose to explore was the question of, “What am I ?” What I ended up doing was to try and experience consciousness at the very moment it was occurring before I began to think or get any type of input from the environment or from within my own mind. The time I spent doing this was by far the most powerful and fulfilling moments of my meditation. The best explanation I have for what I discovered is to say that I was able to see and feel the energy that is me. I was able to hone in on the initial energy that spawns my consciousness and appreciate it in all it’s power.

I use the word power, because when I …..”saw” that, it felt as if I became one with that energy and the sensation I had was as if I was expanding in all directions. The feeling was both of power and release. It was one of the most beautiful feelings in my life and it makes me feel uplifted and renewed every time I think of it. The sense of empowerment I attained from this experience is something that excites me because it’s as if I’ve felt how special our existence is.

I was convinced before this experience that the true path to happiness is through bringing happiness and peace to other people, so the next thing I wanted to focus on was how to effectively do that in all areas of my life. The overwhelming feeling I got as I began to explore how to most effectively achieve my ultimate goal of enriching other people’s lives was to live by example and to have an extraordinary life. A quote would periodically come to me as I thought about this. I first heard it from John Wooden, but I believe it’s from Rudyard Kipling. “No printed word, nor spoken plea can teach young minds what they should be. Not all the books on all the shelves – but what the teachers are themselves.” The importance of letting my light shine as bright as possible reverberated through my consciousness and the benefit to myself and the people I intend to help around me was unquestionable to my concentrated mind. The feeling was as though the base energy I experienced should be expressed in its most true and most powerful form to accomplish the most good.

I also wanted to focus on what I considered to be the worst part of myself, and when I turned my attention to this issue, the thing that immediately popped out was wasted time. It wasn’t just a general recognition, but because of my state of mind, I was able to fully appreciate the full implications and meaning of that lost time. I’ve begun to implement reminders for myself to improve and realize my full potential. It was a little unsettling to focus my thoughts so clearly and roll them around in isolation. Seeing things for how they truly are is extremely beneficial though.

Physically, it’s a long time to remain perfectly still for 2 hours. At one point, I had to swallow. My mind was so focused at the point this happened that it only registered my mouth and the small part of my upper throat that I could feel moving. The rest of me still didn’t register and it was as if I only came into existence physically in that small area of my body that I had used to swallow. I almost felt like a smaller type of organism that only had a mouth and throat. I also popped my knuckles a couple of times, and it was really cool how in tune you become to sounds when there’s nothing happening externally or internally (mentally).

There’s more that I can share that I’m not going to in order to keep the post from going on too long. I fully intend to continue using a tank in meditation in order to improve and find peace with where I’m at and where I’m going. In my opinion it’s a really effective form of prayer. It’s a long way to drive at the place I’ve been going, so I’m probably going to have to buy my own tank. There’s a spot in the basement that’s perfect for it. All I have to do is sell the idea to my wife….. "	t5_2qnc9	True

A few months back my wife of 13 years was caught cheating on me with a good friend. I've pretty much gotten over it, but I have some days (usually just a few hours, actually) where I just can't seem to 'get on top' of my feelings. I don't want to pretend that I'm not angry about what happened, or suppress anything that I genuinely feel. But I don't want the anger as it just makes me feel shitty, and I have time being present when I'm there.

It's unhealthy even. I sometimes have violent fantasies about beating the living fuck out of this former friend. 29/30 days are not a problem, but a day like today I couldn't enjoy my beautiful surroundings because of this anger. I don't want to carry this with me any more.

For us in India, the political scenario has been on the boil too as the ruling party gets tangled in landmark corruption cases and fares poorly in regional elections.

--

Some years ago, I used to follow politics intently, had an opinion on almost every topic, debated it passionately and really cared about it.

Needless to say, however, this didn't help my stress or anxiety.

After practicing meditation on and off for a while, I've noticed that I've stopped caring. I still have opinions on raging issues, but they aren't strong opinions any more.

I've also noticed me becoming more compassionate to the other side's argument. Sometimes I work to be more compassionate.

But on the whole, it's more of me stopped caring to a great degree.

--

Of course personally I think this is a good thing. I'm more at peace. I won't get provoked, agitated or worried unlike in the past.

But am I abandoning my community duties by not caring and not advocating for what I believe is correct? My mind can argue both sides.

1360421467.0	186yqr	Desiring anything from other people -- why its better that we don't.	_KGB_	62	5	24	"At some point in my personal search for truth, I came to the conclusion that our bodies ""want"" to help us do the things we want to do. In fact, the body spends a lot of effort trying to figure out what we want and then how do it -- a large amount of this effort is entirely subconscious. The reason that this system is problematic and causes suffering, is that the subconscious systems in the body really only have direct lines at controlling the body itself and our perceptions of reality. Any change our bodies instigate in our environment, including in people in our environment, has to be instigated through the body's physical presence in the environment or by changing our perception (or sensations). 

So, say you've determined that you want your mom to spend less time with her boyfriend. Your body assimilates this desire then tries to figure out how manifest it. The body has no direct line to force your mom to change the behavior, so instead it looks for ways to change your behavior, so as to change your mom's behavior. From previous experience, it determines that providing you with a strong painful negative emotion in the presence of your mom and her BF, might provoke a change in your mom's behavior that might push her away from the BF. Thus, suffering.

Instead, being mindful of our desires, we're able to avoid desiring things that we can't control (or at least modify these desires if we catch them)."	t5_2qnc9	True

1349775338.0	116t1i	Simple Qigong Technique that Helped Me Immensely 	LonelyOutsideTheBox	66	9	40	"I started trying to meditate daily at the beginning of September. My goal was 10 minutes for the first four weeks, then 15 the next four and finally pushing it to 20 for the month of November. I tried close-eyed style as well as open-eyed, but after three weeks that 10 minutes, usually over lunch, was the longest part of my day. I dreaded it, but I did it.

Then I took a Qigong class. I learned about a technique called the pole technique that changed everything for me. It seems giving my body something to do made all the difference. 

Basically you stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Then bend your knees til they are over your toes. As for your arms, reach out as if you're hugging a pole or tree, but then bring your hands in so that they're about one foot from your chest. Your middle fingers should be pointing at each other and about one fist-width apart. Now, let everything basically hang. And hold it. For as long as you can.

Like I mentioned, those 10 minutes were torture for me. The first time I tried this pole-hugging technique I simply started a stopwatch to see how long I could hold it. I held it and held it, and I could have held it a bit longer even though I was getting sore, but I was worried I was going to be late for work (I tried this in the morning). I ended up holding it for a little more than 21 minutes. Now I actually look forward to my sessions in the morning. And, I feel like I'm jinxing it, but I swear I feel more energized throughout the day. 

Anyways, if you're having trouble just sitting there while trying to meditate, give it try. "	t5_2qnc9	True

Recently, I started going to a local Zen group, and although I generally meditate between 15-30 minutes a day, I started attending to see what longer periods would be like.  The times I'm there, I meditate with them for three 25 minute sessions in two hours, interspersed with some walking meditation.  So far, that has worked out fine for me.  I started to notice more of a sense of space for myself as I go about my day, and it's been very nice.

A few weeks ago, I decided to attend a day long meditation with the Zen group.  I was a bit apprehensive about it.  The morning was okay, but in the afternoon I just couldn't wait to get out.  Afterward, I went home and took a nap, and noticed the strangest thing when I woke up -- I wasn't thinking.  I was just observing.  It was a very freaky feeling as I'm a guy who tends to live in his head.  I walked around my apartment just seeing with no real sense of myself.  It was very nice, and unexpected.

The next day, I went off with some friends to a lake and I noticed something very cool also.  There was this goopy, mossy thing growing in the lake with  long translucent strands coming from it.  It's the sort of thing that you see in lakes around where I live and frankly, it is kind of gross.  It's the sort of thing that, when I see it, I sort of shiver because I can imagine touching those strands and, well, it seems gross.  That day, however, I saw that thing in the lake and I was just seeing it.  No sense of what it was, or myself in relation to it, just appreciating its shape and beautiful colors in the sunlight.  Very interesting experience.

I'm trying not to get attached to the memory of those experiences of lucidity, but they were very enjoyable.  I really didn't expect to have them.  They were a very nice surprise.

I guess there are no guarantees in life, but the thing I want to say is if you've just started with meditation, stick with it.  There can be some very interesting experiences along the way."	t5_2qnc9	True

I won't go through the schedule, technique etc, (there are other places for that) but just share some experiences.

An emphasis was placed on **Noble Silence,** not communicating at all with fellow meditators. After a few days this highlighted the internal chatter I carry around with me constantly; the conversations didn't stop, except now they weren't being interupted by anyone!

The first three days was all about **focusing on the breath.** For the first time i actually gave quality concentration to this fundamental practice, and felt the difference after a day or too. It's like drinking cool water when you have a dry cough - it was worth attending for this alone!

The next stage was about concentrating on bodily sensations, using the concentration we had generated in our breathing practice to find subtle sensations. **After a day or two I could feel my heart beating in my chest cavity** - i felt like my lungs were a bell and this pulsing beat was the clapper. The instructions say to move over each part, not preferring one to the other but i did dawdle over the sensation of the heart, really enjoyed that.

Had some peak experiences (*""I'm not my body! It's this thing composed of sensations and I can disregard it if i wish! WOOHOO!""*), a bit of a slump (*""I have never had a genuine thought of concern for anyone - EVER. The world would be a better place if I didn't exist.""*) and a few sessions that were ALL distractions. I spent a whole session fantasizing about seducing a person I shared a house with a decade ago.

Do i feel different? Definitely more calm, interesting to see how long that lasts. Much more mindful now of the bodily sensations when I'm walking, going to the toilet, eating etc. Very useful, brings me away from whatever fantasy I'm absorbed in.

I'd recommend this if you have some experience in meditation and you want a challenge. I'd say doing yoga is useful too, because you will do a lot of sitting and you will get sore.

I also live in NYC, a city with many distractions, and I have a tendency to let myself fall prey to the many things pulling at my attention, especially people-watching.

Yesterday, while walking through SOHO (a very busy neighborhood), I experimented with keeping my eyes forward and not letting my attention get pulled away from my path in front of me, while remaining aware of my surroundings. I was surprised by the difficulty of the task. Here are a few things I noticed:

1. I get very distracted by pretty women. I mean, it *was* SOHO, but I was shocked by my tendency to take note of every single semi-attractive woman to walk by, and my ensuing ""deeeyamn""-mentality.

2. I found myself judging people that I would make superficial assessments of. 

3. I let my attention get pulled in many different directions in a very short time.

After a few minutes of this calm, 'mindful' walking - eyes forward, breathing, letting distractions pass - I felt much more centered and focused. It also helped me realize just how much energy I waste on fruitlessly checking out women, and how unnecessary it is. Eventually that impulse receded and I was much more able to focus on what I needed to focus on.

1360197990.0	1818ux	I just practically climaxed. What happened?	panigale	91	31	43	"So I learned TM over a decade ago and have tended to use it sporadically. I have gone through stages of daily practice, but more often I have used it as an ad hoc stress relief mechanism when the need arises. Recently I have picked up again with daily practice.

I was just now meditating in my office before starting work, and after the usual process of gently disengaging from emerging thoughts and drifting to a state of no-thought, I found myself experiencing subtle waves of warmth through my body. This is not uncommon when I meditate and I allow it to happen. It is pleasant and only a temporary stage of my meditation. But whereas previously the sensation has been brief and mild, this time the waves grew in intensity and my breathing picked up from the highly subdued level it normally reaches while meditating. It built steadily to the point where my breathing was very heavy; I was gasping, rolling in my chair, and perceived intense waves of warmth moving up my body. Don't ask me why, but they move in an upward direction.

I am male. I had no erection or excitement in my genital region. But the excitement, breathing, warmth and tingling over the rest of my body reminds me very much of the sensation I get when I climax sexually. In all honesty it felt exactly like a massive climax, but without the erection or ejaculation. When I came to, I found I had been ""under"" for half an hour. I am still tingling as I write this.

Any explanations? Have others experienced similar? Any tips on getting back there?

EDIT: Even now, over 3 hours afterwards, I simply have to relax in my chair and I can quickly feel the waves of sensation returning. Maybe not wise at work, it could easily be misinterpreted!

EDIT 2: Okay, so three respondents have now told me something along the lines that it is my kundalini awakening, or at least starting to. I think we can call that a consensus for the moment. I am definitely going to be learning more about this. Thanks! In approaching this I read the FAQ and they didn't answer my question.

1325296704.0	nwzuw	I have been meditating for exactly 30 days now. For those who are interested, these are my thoughts.	amarcord	73	16	21	"I apologise in advance for the wall of text. I hope I made it sufficiently interesting for everyone to read.

As a few of you might remember, a few weeks ago I started a thread asking for advice concerning meditation for the improvement of cognition. I had been meditating for a few days at that point and I just completed one month of daily meditation now. I used basic instructions derived from Mindfulness in Plain English and other advice on the forum, plus a little improvisation and instinct whenever I was confronted with new situations. I meditate for 20 minutes every session, one session a day, sometimes adding a 5 or 10 minute session in the morning or in the evening if I am in the mood to do so. I have been quite wary of burning out if I try too hard and I keep my workload low but my dedication steady.
The following are the somewhat scattered intuitions and doubts I have collected over the past month. I hope they might be useful to other total beginners and I encourage more experienced meditators and newbies alike to comment on them.

* The hardest and most confusing task for me (and probably most beginners), and the one I have read the least about in sufficiently objective terms, is understanding what ""focusing on the breath"" means. For some reason most references seem to be very down-to-earth when they discuss how to position your knees and very mystical or airy-fairy when it comes to defining what ""watching the breath"" means. Being non-religious myself I tend to appreciate sources that refer to internal states objectively or that speak argumentatively rather than declaratively.
Without understanding what that very interior state feels like, it is impossible to bring back the wandering mind to anything at all. Only about two weeks into my meditation, and for not more than five seconds, I ""felt"" for the first time I was watching my breath, rather than mentally saying to myself: ""Ok I am breathing, now let's see what happens"". 

* I also found that there is a difference between acknowledging that a breath has just been exhaled, or expecting the next inhalation, and noticing the breathing *as* it occurs, microsecond by microsecond, synchronising the feeling and the observation, never letting the latter lag on or anticipate the former. This is a very recent realisation and not at all a mindfulness skill which I master (yet), but it gave me a glimpse on what the author of Mindfulness in Plain English meant when he discussed accepting and cherishing the impermanence of experience. I try to treat every single breath as a unique snowflake, which I can only experience for a brief moment before it melts, and which I will never see again, before another one comes, as transient as the previous one.

* A second problemis not just removing the distractions that enter the head while meditating, but all the thought 'subroutines' whose presence I am not aware of when I sit on the pillow - but which are nonetheless still running. The sneakiest of all for me is the internal verbalisation of the experience of meditation, the telling to oneself things akin to ""Ok, now I am meditating"", which instinctively do not appear as distractions at all.
Additionally,  when I become aware of a distractive thought it seems natural to counter it with another distraction. The thought ""Oops I was thinking of bacon. Good thing I realised it, now I can go back to watching my breath"" becomes its own sub-routine which must be then identified as such and removed (and possibly not replaced with a third subroutine). This seems to create recursive loops.

* Somebody some time ago in this subreddit defined meditation as a weight workout,  with each repetition of a weight set being not the time spent watching the breath, but each instance of removal of unwanted thought. Every time one expends energy to redirect attention from whatever occurred in his head to his breath, a little improvement takes place which is carried on to the next distraction, the next minute of meditation, the next session. The mind becomes focused on the breath as a consequence of the workout, it is not the workout. I agree with that statement and it should be made prominent in instructions given to beginners.

* Coincidentally, I have already found meditation useful on the actual gym floor. Whenever I am ready to unrack a barbell I find myself more capable to zero in more attention than usual on my body, on the barbell and on the combined feeling of the two things - at least for those twenty-thirty seconds of a set. Fewer unwanted thoughts start cruising my busy mind in those instances.

* Meditation so far seems to be the art of stopping the conscious mind at the ""logic gates"" of experience, analysing nanoscale internal *affects* that normally lead to immediate *effects*. Meditation allows for moment-by-moment decisions on how to react on such *affects* without being passively subjected to knee-jerk *effects*. With patience and without forcing myself too much I have been trying, every time I am about to light a cigarette (bad habit, I know) to wait for a few seconds and focus on the sensation of craving 'non-judgementally', observing it for what it is, without telling myself I should or shouldn't smoke it. When I am done, I decide whether I want to light it or not. Most times I still do, a few times I don't. Since I am on the topic of smoking, so far the most beautiful experience I had after meditating was lighting a cigarette a couple of minutes after a session. I was experiencing a quite interesting sensation of relaxation and as I sat there with the cigarette in hand, I spent a few minutes calmly contemplating the light coming in from the window, crisscrossing the cigarette's smoke beautifully dancing and twirling in the air. Of the thousands of cigarettes I smoked in my life, I had never noticed the beauty and complexity of that little devil's smoke.

* I meditate cross-legged on a makeshift large pillow, in a position that seems sufficiently conducive to good posture. As I start my routine I make sure my back is straight and my head faces forward. Inevitably however, over the course of the session my back slouches a bit and my head follows, reaching a perhaps acceptable but sub-par position. Whenever I become aware of this, it requires me to interrupt my mindfulness (assuming I had any to start with), reposition myself and start concentrating again. Am I doing this right? Should I just ignore it once I'm in position?

* Considered that of course not everyone is the same and that it takes time to develop any significant result, what type of timeline should I expect to see my 'mindfulness' improving to see if I'm doing things right? How should meditating affect mindfulness during my daily life?

* Finally, I found that Mindfulness in Plain English and other online sources explain meditation pretty well for a beginner, but so far the best, most condensed and most objective insight I have read are on this subreddit. Wouldn't it be a neat idea to start a collaborative wiki/introduction to meditation to publish on the sidebar, or to significantly expand the current FAQ?"	t5_2qnc9	True
1323708126.0	n9s1x	Just got back from my first 10-day Goenka retreat. When do I stop tripping balls?	classical_hero	60	6	52	"As the title says, I just got back from my first ever 10-day Goenka retreat. I'm assuming most people on this site are familiar with these, but if not there is more info on http://www.dhamma.org.

Anyway this was my first real experience with any type of meditation, other than having read Mindfulness In Plain English first and tried it out a bit before committing to going. Everything was going great until day 6 when we started doing the full vipassana technique, scanning our bodies from both head to feet and also feet to head. At this point all sorts of weird stuff started happening.

The first and most weird is that I have an old back injury. It's not exactly clear what it is, but my lower back seems to be a bit more narrow than normal, possibly due to congenital reasons. It's possible that there might have also been a microtear at one point that was allowing spinal fluid to press against the spinal cord. I was on my college rowing team, and apparently this sort of injury is common amongst rowers, so they assumed this is what was happening even though the MRI didn't show anything. 

The symptoms I was having at the time, about 5 years ago, was basically that my legs were very weak and would continue to get worse and worse until I took an anti-inflammatory drug, and if not it would eventually get so that I couldn't stand anymore. So I had to take ibuprofen twice a week or so for a while. It's been fine for at least a year though unless I drink a lot, which I rarely do.

Anyway so what happened is that after day 5 my legs started walking themselves. I still had to decide where to go and look where I was going, but once I took the first step my legs would basically walk completely autonomously without any input from me. After a few hours this went away, and what replaced it was essentially a very subtle feeling of electricity coming out of this old lower back injury and then going up my back and eventually washing over my face. This would happen every 12 seconds or so, and last for about three seconds. Every time this would happen my back and posture would straighten up and again my legs would start walking on their own, at a faster cadence than I normally walk and with a slightly different walking style. The feeling of the electricity itself was not unpleasant at all, it was almost like a very subtle electrostim that you would get as part of rehab for an injury, almost pleasant in nature. This has mostly gone away, but I'm still trying to figure out what the hell was going on here as it was extremely weird.

The second thing that was happening, and that's still happening, is that I can still feel energy flowing from head to feet and feet to head just walking around. Basically on day 5 or 6 I started getting this free flow of energy, and it felt like a ring of consciousness was going up and down my body for lack of a better word. Every time this ring passed over a passed of my body it would slightly stiffen up. This is still happening. It's not extremely aggravating, but it definitely makes me a little sea sick as everything is still wobbling a bit. I just got back from the retreat yesterday morning so it may still go away, but I'm wondering if anyone else knows what I'm talking about or has any idea if there is anything that can be done about this. It doesn't especially bother me and I wouldn't freak out if it was here indefinitely, but all things being equal I would probably prefer it to be gone. Because of this I haven't been meditating today, even though otherwise I would have wanted to keep with doing the hour and the morning and evening as Goenka recommends. 

Other than the physical weirdness, which I simply wasn't expecting, I did enjoy most aspects of the course, albeit I do think there are some improvements that could and probably should be made. E.g. I think students should be able to access real medical experts during the course because it is so demanding and because so many things go up, simply saying Anicca isn't good enough for people who need health or mental health advice.  Anyway also feel free to ask me any questions related to my experience"	t5_2qnc9	True
1300567750.0	g78a0	"Anxiety and panic are illusions! Be free!
A five minute meditation anyone can do, anywhere."	ThankTheMaker	65	11	20	"Most of our meditation times are somewhat planned out and eased into.

But anxiety or panic can strike, seemingly, out of the blue.


Here's a quick ""self-defense meditation"" that absolutely saved me from panic.


The first thing to realize is that fear is an evolutionary instinct to keep us from jumping off of cliffs or running into traffic, but when this fear arises while we're in no danger, it's now become irrational anxiety/panic.


The main thing that sets us into panic is our breathing becomes very shallow and quickened as a result of our heart-rate going up and our bodies creating adrenaline, which robs our brain of oxygen and keeps us from being rational and accepting reality. Here's a simple way to defeat these symptoms, as well as their root cause:


* Sit down.

* Hold your hands palm up in your lap.

* Touch your index fingers to your thumbs.

* Breathe in as deep as you can and hold it. Count to 5. Let it out.

* Breathe as deeply as possible and as slow as possible for five long breaths.

* Repeat this for all 4 fingers.



* Realize that everything is alright and focus on a love-filled memory.


Holding your breath as well as breathing slowly helps to slow your heart-rate
and stops the production of adrenaline in your body.


Once you calm down and supply your brain with enough oxygen, you can begin to think more clearly.



My biggest problem was that I would sit in the ""neutral"" zone all day.
Not being fearful, but also, not being truly happy.


* Pure and fearless happiness is standing next to you every moment of the day.




* All you need to do is turn away from negativity, even for a brief moment,
let go of your stress, and surrender to joy. Consciously choose positivity everyday, all day.

Be free."	t5_2qnc9	True
1375745269.0	1jrw65	"How I got past the ""Am I doing it right?"" phase."	fiercebrosnan	61	5	10	"When I first started sitting, I navigated through a pattern of uncertainty and concern that I like to call the ""Am I doing it right?"" phase. I had read a few free books on the topic (Mindfulness in Plain English is awesome), and so I had a lot of advice to go off of, but I still got stuck on whether or not I was meditating ""properly"". 

I would have a negative, pointless thought go through my head. I'd stop myself, admonish myself, tell myself ""you're not supposed to get upset about it, just let it float by"", and go back to the breath. After doing that 10 times in a minute, I'd realize how much of a monkey mind I had going on. It started to get a bit frustrating, because I felt like I should have pushed beyond that by now, and that if I could just do that, there would be greater insights beyond the horizon.

Today, one thought pushed me past all that. I wanted my thoughts to settle, and they just wouldn't. At that moment, I said to myself, ""**This is your mind, deal with it.**"" 

All of these thoughts in my head, from the random bits of music and sentence fragments to the bigger ideas that never fail to pull me off the breath, make my mind what it is. That's what I have to pay attention to. It won't ""go away"" if I ""meditate properly"". Proper mindfulness is just about keeping myself from getting emotionally attached while gleaning as much insight as I can from all of the madness. That storm of nonsense is my home, I'm already doing it right.

Eventually, I'll have to take it a step further, because I'm still speaking in terms of the ego, but it was a really great feeling. I had to pass it along. "	t5_2qnc9	True

But in the midst of a panic attack all reasoning goes away and is replaced only with fear and the urge to fight it at all costs.

The reason I ask is because I've been meditating daily (15-20 min) for about 3 weeks now and seem to still be having a tough time becoming mindful when sitting - I have lots of wandering thoughts that I get caught up in for a while before returning focus to my breath.

I realize that meditation should be done for its own sake and that there's no real way to ""fail"" when it comes to this stuff, but I'm still struggling to find motivation to sit each day.

1359999744.0	17vk1h	Guided Visualization for understanding the how's and why's of meditation	SyrupMoon	64	9	10	"Many of us new to meditation or struggling with it aren't quite sure what exactly they are suppose to be doing to be doing it right. Many people ask me if they are meditating correctly, or what's the right way to do it. Meditation can be done in many different ways but the focus and reasons for our meditation is very distinct. We meditate to find focus, to see truth, to become present, to reach awareness of the truth within ourselves. Most all variations of meditation fall under these aims.

For those confused about ""how' to meditate, I can completely understand. A certain level of insight into truth is needed to realize what meditation is doing for you. When starting a meditation practice for a while it seems like your just sitting still for no reason. Once you understand the effects of meditation by experiencing them yourself  you instantly come to understand the how's and why's. 

Let me offer a few metaphors to help you understand why meditation is such a powerful practice and how it's done correctly.

Imagine yourself meditating, but take away your ego. Imagine yourself as a human being naked in nature, sitting still in meditation. Imagine waves of energy flowing inside this human being, those waves representing all the busy thoughts in your mind swirling around in your body like dirt floating in a glass of muddy water. These thoughts are not you, they all arise from the society you are part of, from the life you've led up until now. They all have affinities and reasons for arising. They are completely selfless and transient. In meditation you watch these thoughts, you watch them flow by like a passing train without following them, because with awareness you become separate from your thoughts. They soon lose their energy and start to subside. The mud begins to settle at the bottom of the glass. The spaces between the train carts become wider and wider. The waves of energy stop defining the space of the human being and the boundaries made by the thought energy starts dissolving. The water becomes clear, the railroad empty and you begin to see yourself for who you really are. You become present in the world outside of your mind. You begin to see yourself as something separate from the ego, a space of awareness in which all these emotions and sensations arise and pass in. 

By sitting in meditation and observing your breath you are sharpening your mind to focus on the truth of the present moment. You do not try and breathe you just watch your body breathing, you watch your mind thinking, you watch whatever it is thats going on inside you, whatever the truth really is, and by watching and not reacting, you gain space between your true self and the story your living. In that space you find complete freedom, glorious bliss.

In your life you slowly start seeing the difference between story and truth. You start walking around with this space you've created for yourself. You stop reacting habitually to things and start acting with intent and compassion. 

Only you can discover the truth for yourself.

I really need a guided breathing/relaxation video dedicated just to helping DURING an actual panic attack. I've been trying to find a video or audio recording to listen to in case I couldn't get someone to help me when I start panicking and can't calm myself down, but haven't had much luck finding one that doesn't have unnecessary music or noise in the background or a semi-robotic voice or someone who is speaking too loud (these things actually just trigger me more). None of them feel really personal either. Most anxiety sufferers like myself are more responsive if we feel like someone is actually there with us and talking to us as if they were a close friend trying to help instead of said robotic-voice. Also, different voice types help different people. For example, personally, male voices help me calm down and female voices tend to irritate me when I am panicking or anxious. Some people are just the opposite.

Once again, this is merely a request and me rambling out my thoughts and feelings. At this point, I'm pretty desperate for relief from panic attacks that I can't seem to bring myself anymore without help. I know I'm not the only one from /r/anxiety who would greatly appreciate any assistance on this matter.

Pengy945	61	8	3	"“When you listen deeply, feel intimately, and allow yourself to experience this moment exactly as it is, the emotional and energetic bodies soften. Take a few minutes now to just listen to and become aware of your surroundings. As you let the sounds become known, also become aware of the scent and the feel of the space around you in and outside of the room so that your feeling sense isn’t confined to your skin and bones. Give yourself an opportunity to be open to the environment of sound and a sense of the space outside your body.

Notice that the more you relax, these sounds and experiences penetrate you and flow into you without defense. You will feel yourself softening and opening. Invite yourself into this openness. You may find that the sense of a barrier between the outside world and what’s happening inside your skin becomes very transparent, or you may feel as if you can’t find the boundary between the inside and outside. Experiences of outside noise and what is happening in your body become of the same quality. A feeling in your body isn’t really different than the sound of a car driving by or a bird in the trees. A feeling in your body is not really any more yours than the feeling of the space in the room where you sit. Notice that if you begin to take ownership of any experience, this starts to divide the world into inner and outer, mine and theirs, an outside sound and me.

I decided to spend a lot of time the last few months reading books about meditation, but I've found this little manual more helpful than anything else.

I've been working with it for a couple of months now at 2+ hours a day of meditation, and have progressed to stages 4-5. If anyone has questions about this meditation framework I'd love to answer. I also highly recommend checking out his dharmatreasure.com website, which has a lot of free and useful content. 

edit: To clarify, the manual's main benefit is not diagnosing which stage you are at, but being clear about goals of meditation as you progress. His discussion on the balance between dullness/restlessness and concentration/awareness was very insightful for me. In my opinion, a lot of teachers overemphasize calming restlessness and ""monkey mind"" without going into much detail about how much of a problem dullness can become if you don't deal with it. Also, while most teachers choose to emphasize either concentration or awareness, Culadasa suggests balancing both at the same time."	t5_2qnc9	True

1331422834.0	qqutc	Had a psychotic response to meditation - Kundalini Syndrome	kundalinihelp	67	15	63	"I have a minor crisis in that I'm unable to meditate anymore, in fear that I may bring back psychotic symptoms that I experienced a few days ago. I apologise my wall of text below, but I'd like to detail exactly what I have gone through in hope someone can provide some insight or some guidance. I don't expect anyone to provide answers, but I'm hoping at least someone can point me to a better location/contact.

I had decided to go onto a 10 day meditation course that taught vipassana meditation. It was a program where we had to meditate 10 hours a day for 10 days. 
For the first three days we did anapana meditation, then on the fourth day we started vipassanna meditation. My concentration  was already quite strong as I've had a lot of experience with concentration meditation, so I found the first three days relatively easy (apart from the pain in sitting cross legged). I've entered Jahana in the past, and entered Jahana once while doing anapana meditation on the course.

Difficulties started to arise when I attempted vipassna meditation. On the second session of attempting it, I had a intense feeling of nausea, and I had a great amount of stress flowing out of my body, I felt like I had a fever. 
However on the next attempt, I had adjusted to it and was able to easily navigate through my body and examine the different regions with little thought entering my head (just experiencing).
On the night of the fifth day (one whole day of vipassana meditation), I experienced a buzzing in my head, felt a bit disorientated and dizzy, but nothing too major.. I had a bit of difficultly falling asleep as I felt a bit strange.. 
When I woke up in the morning I felt normal again, so continued on with the vipassana meditation.

The major problems arose on the night of the 6th day.

After a heavy session of vipassana meditation, I felt unusual, like I had felt the day before, but the vibrations were stronger and I got dizzy whenever I shifted my eyes, I found it difficult to focus on things.
After an hour or so after these symtoms, things started to get worse.
I had an experience of derealisation, I felt like at any moment reality would just shift and dissipate into chaos/nothing. I had intense vibration occuring in my head and I had really loud tinnitus occurring in my ears. 

I had a feeling of paranoia arising. This is when I tried to go to my sleeping quarters and sleep it off.
While lying in bed I started hallucinating fractal patterns and psychedelic images (with eyes open). I had a ""shock"" of orgasmic electricity starting from my foot, running up my spinal column and ending in my head. This occurred every 20-30 seconds. I was at the cusp of having a panic attack, I felt like I was leaving my old self behind. It was a very difficult experience.
I spent the next 3-4 hours trying to ground myself by reading instructions on the back of an alarm clock, trying my best to fantasise about various things, and I started shacking my body (rocking back and forth very quickly).

During this whole ordeal, I also had a shift in perception of reality. I saw the emptiness of everything, it was very difficult to accept. Everything I loved and cherished was no longer permanent/stable. I also found it difficult to accept the amount of suffering that occurs throughout existence. It felt like the ""experience"" was telling me to let go of everything, but I was not ready, so I resisted with all my might. I wasn't ready to give up my cozy concept of reality.

I spoke to the meditation teacher the next day. He was surprised with what happened with me, he's never heard of it happening to anyone. I am not sure how many people he's dealt with, but I wouldn't be surprised if it ran into the thousands. (there were around 50 students while I was there). He said the opposite should happen: I should get more grounded with meditation. We concluded that I may have been doing the practice incorrectly. Although I sincerely tried my best to follow instructions. I made a decision to leave the course rather than try my luck.

Over the following days, I had a bit of disorientation/dizziness and some paranoia, but nothing I couldn't handle. I did my best to ground myself by watching a lot of TV, talking to people, going out, etc.

I am now sitting here mostly grounded (very subtle vibration occurring in my head) trying to make sense of the situation.

I've noticed a few changes in myself, I am more patient, I am more compassionate, I am more happy, but it is nothing too major, mostly subtle, but definitely noticeable. My ability to go into deep concentration had greatly increased (I tried this once, but got some of the original symptoms and decided to stop). 

I've done some research on my experience and came across [kundalini syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini_syndrome) (I knew about this before, but not in detail). I was surprised that the symptoms listed are almost exactly what I experienced (there are a few I did not experience, and a few that are not listed). 


I am going to be giving up meditation for a long while until I know it's safe. It may be that I am prone to schizophrenia and meditation is a catalyst for it. 

but now the questions remain:
Why did this happen to me, and not any of the other students?
What does this experience signify? 
Are there any recommended specialists that deal with this?
Will I ever be able to meditate again?

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

1326823738.0	ol3x0	Started meditating few weeks back, came to one of the biggest realizations of my life.	Trappi53	57	8	49	"So I started meditating few weeks ago. I just concentrated on my breathing, did not feel like I had much success, just felt pretty calm after the sessions. I am not sure if I figured this thing out because of meditating or just because of the things I experience in my life right now but now I realized that I absolutely hate my major in college and I can not work in this field ever. 
I study accounting, this is my 3rd year and I started doing it because I though I would eventually start to like it along the way and I could also make decent money if I am done. Turns out I hate this subject and I can not see myself working as an accountant or as anything related to this. I have 2 years left and I know that if I keep studying this I would waste another 2 years for nothing.

The big problem is that I still don't know what I want to do with my life, I feel pretty aimless. I don't know what my passion is and I can't really find the true source of happiness right now. I am 20 years old I think my parents would be supportive if I actually had anything in my mind but I just don't know which direction to go.

I would ask for some advice from people who have been in a similar situation, or from people who have found theire passion in theire life to help me find the right path.

edit: Thanks a lot for your input! I never thought I would get so many responses. So many wise, insightful comments. Lot of them made a very deep impression on me! I'm really glad I made this post, helped me a lot and if there is anyone who is walking in the same shoes as me and got some good advices from others here it makes it even better.
I am going to a consultant next week, see if I can find out something about myself that I don't know yet. 
Its nice to see that there are people who found theire passion and life a happy life and I am very thankful for all your support.
I know I might not be able to get a lot of money from my passion, but I really hope I can attain something close to that.

The ""practice"" part of meditation is being able to recognize this phenomenon of being wrapped up in a thought. And when it is recognized, the mind's attention is thus returned to the present moment, usually with the continual focus on the breath and the body.

1338482081.0	ue2jr	I was in a brain wash cult and other factors that might affect my meditation...I have questions.	WorryLater	63	11	46	"sorry for this wall of text:

Alright, so my ""spiritual"" journey started around the age of 6, I would say. By that I mean that was when I made the decision (though looking back, I was a very easily influenced 6 year old) to seek out the spiritual things. 

My mom was going through a bad divorce and met a lady at her work who invited us to a very charismatic/evangelical church. Praying in tongues and ""prophecy"" was a very normal part of my childhood/young adulthood (and the same goes for many of my friends, though some would like to forget all of that. myself included). In hindsight, and through therapy, I realized that I clung to all of that because I had no family really. My mom was what I had as a young person and I had seen her strength and trusted her, so I jumped in. I ""spoke in tongues"" for hours, prayed for hours, fasted, danced, shouted, cried and the like for years...I thought it was God. I thought it was what God wanted. 

Fast forward to highschool, I fell in love with a Hindu. It could never work, and knowing that I couldn't be with this person because our religions weren't the same (can't be unequally yolked, like the bible says) wrecked my life to no end. I would have conversations with this person's sister (she was older and wiser) about how I felt and the pain I was in. She had a simple suggestion, meditation. Though she didn't call it that, the practice for relaxing that she described was just that. I promise I'm going somewhere with this....

Fast forward to me being 18...I go off to this place called Teen Mania, so I could find God's call on my life. A simple search in the Reddit Search bar will bring up enough info about Teen Mania, but this is what the days where like: Wake up at 5 am for exercise, breakfast around 6 (you need to hurry through it) then shower and quiet time til around 7:30 or 8. Then work til noon (I was a grounds keeper) eat lunch, maybe have a class til 2 (depending on the time of year) work til 5 or 6, more class then dinner or vice versa, then different activities with your ""group"" or CORE...my days ended between 10 and midnight. This was how my year went, for exactly one year. 

Throughout that year are different retreats to ""bring you closer to God"", but really what was happening was that I was giving up my critical thinking and my mind in the name of God to make someone else money. 

In the couple of years that followed after leaving, my dad went missing, both of his brothers died, I drank a lot (I'm in my early 20's, it happens), I've tried enough drugs, I've left the church altogether, I've gone to therapy, I've had symptoms of PTSD, I've had an out of body experience not related to drug use, and all in all I still have this spiritual longing...it doesn't go away. I've meditated very little, outside of christian meditation and prayer, but I feel like some of the results are similar.

I'm just very scared. I've been hurt, and abused. I'm scared of the spiritual side of things...and I'm scared that meditating will bring back memories or traumas and I'm not going to know how to deal with them...or it'll be like a bad acid trip (if you've been in a brainwash cult, I wouldn't recommend acid for a very long time after leaving). I don't want to associate substance with anything spiritual (though lots of people do), but often times that's how I get my fix so to speak. That's what feels natural now in place of where I used to pray or read my bible, or just sit in silence. 

I want to know what's ""safe""...I'm interested in zen buddhism as well, but I doubt I'll return to the church at all. If I do, I'm going catholic or episcopalian. 

is this too much? are my questions unclear? am I making sense at all?

1324039602.0	nf44k	Let go of the Fear	meddytator	57	4	12	"Hey guys,

I have been going through a rough patch this year and became interested in meditation some months ago, but practice remained half-hearted and frustrating.

Today has been one of the craziest days of my life. Began antidepressants this week, and have been dealing with a rollercoaster of jaw-clenching, mood-swinging insomnia. I had an anxiety attack at work today, but managed to control the external symptoms enough for no-one to notice, went about my job (hotel doorman) with a cheerful demenor as a Battle Royale between my ego/anxiety (visualised as a dark whispy black gas) and my Being/present moment awareness (a strong radiant white light) took place within my body. I was able to dis-identify from the negativity, visualise it as seperate from myself and for two hours I alternated between wrestling with it and laughing it off. I haven't felt this proud in myself in a long time. Sorry if this wording sounds more like an exorcism than a meditation.

Anyway, later on tonight, I was feeling better about things and trying to come to terms with what today meant and what the anxiety was trying to tell me. I found myself spontaneously assume the sitting position in my lounge room, and had the most beautiful meditative experience of my life to date. I sat for longer than I ever have (probably around 30 minutes) and funnily enough had none of the usual boredom or distractibility and I was completely engrossed in exploring my breath and my inner state, I have a feeling the sleep deprivation helped.

At one point I turned my awareness to my spinal cord and visualised cleansing bursts of radiant joyful white light pulsating my spine with each in/exhale. Soon enough, a message seemed to conjour up in my consciousness; it was simple: *Let go of the fear*. I took this mantra and repeated it to myself in rhythm with my breath for a countless amount of times, before opening my eyes and finding that I was crying.

I feel that this has been a real breakthrough for my meditation and life in general. I couldnt help but be reminded of Bill Hick's ""[It's Just a Ride](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMUiwTubYu0)"" speech, and the dichotomy between Love and Fear. I feel like I have spent much of my life in an anxious fearful state, worrying too much about external influences. But that's all about to change – I haven’t felt so happy and at ease in myself in years.

So, now I'm really not sure if this even belongs here; in any case, thanks to you all for making this an awesome subreddit, and helping me on my way to a better life. Best of luck to you all.

It's been about two weeks now and everyone, including my coworkers and husband, say that I no longer vibrate with tension and anxiety.  I take a multi-pronged approach and try to keep some parts standard and improvise the rest depending on the need.  I start off working on mindfulness for 10-15 minutes, then either do a guided meditation or meditate on the lessons from A Course in Miracles.  I've found it to be very complementary to each other and to the goals I'm working out in therapy.

I had no reason to be upset, no reason to not just, simply smile. Over and over smiles rush to my mouth uncontrollably like chills. Every sensation heightened. 

The water temperature changed quickly to a much hotter degree, and instead of moving out of the way of the flow, I sat. I felt waves of heat rush through my body and leaving me through an overjoyed smile. Even as I write this now I have a smile on my face.

I died already.	white8tiger7	56	5	17	"I was meditating and it hit me like a ton of bricks "" I died already""! I was choking and couldn't breath. I tried calling for my mom, I couldn't scream. I was in pain, it hurt so bad. I fell down, I felt everything slipping away. I saw my mom rushing in. I remember seeing black dots and flashes and then darkness, I remember hearing my mom scream, then silence, I remember not feeling my heart beat, no blood flowing, my lungs not taking in air but I kept gasping, I remember feeling cold and heavy and then nothing. No white light, no guide, no outer body experience, there was nothing after losing consciousness, for me there was nothing.

I remember waking up, my mom was sitting next to me crying, there was a strange man standing over me, he was poking me with needles and took a tube out of my mouth, I coughed and took a deep breath, I felt my body grow warm, I felt tingly, I hurt still but I felt strength and felt my blood flowing and the pounding sound of my heart beat was deafening but I could hear and see again! I reached out for my mom. We arrived at the hospital. The nurses and doctors watched over me, machines told everyone I was ok. I was so scared. My mom told me I was ok, everything was going to be ok. Then sleep.

I thought this was a dream I had when I was a child, throughout my life this ""dream"" would come back to me, especially when things got tough, I ran far from the dream, I wanted to forget the dream, I didn't want to be reminded that this body will die. I was talking to my mom about it, because I've been going through some tough times and my life feels lost and without purpose it's why I started meditating. Depression, anxiety, feeling cold hearted, lack of love, social interaction, illness and financial issues, all had me contemplating suicide, the suffering of life brought me back to one of life's most basic fear. 

My mom looked at me and with the most serious look and tone I've ever seen, ""It's not a dream, you were 2. I heard you coughing and gasping then I heard you fall, I called 911, the paramedic was able to bring you back, you stopped breathing, your heart just stopped. There was no damage to your heart, you weren't choking, there was no medical reason why. You stopped living and for a brief moment you died, I was hoping you'd never remember that. There was no reason other then to remind us that life is so short.""
 
I either had a breakthrough or a breakdown at that moment, it was the most frightening and exciting moment in my life. 

Meditation is very powerful tool. That moment of realization made everything seem so small and insignificant, all the pettiness of work, bills, being to afraid to talk to that guy, to afraid to say I love you, afraid of this aging and pained body, all my fears just, died. And damn life is amazing! I no longer fear death, yes I'm still imperfect and will suffer but now it doesn't matter because in a moment, it will be gone, so through the good and the bad, I'm going to enjoy it!

Now I wonder what else is hidden?

Yesterday I was browsing the interwebs in a few meditation forums, since I wasn't feeling I was doing mindfulness correctly. After reading some very interesting testimonies and general information on related issues, I sat down and turned off the lights.

I would usually make small notes of thoughts and sensations when mindful, but this time it was hardcore, starting off by noting the expansion and contraction of the abdomen, which I felt much more varied and interesting as a point of concentration than the border of the nostrils. As I felt deeper and deeper into meditation and felt the breathing much more subtle, I was observing multiple sensations and thoughts a second, at an ever increasing rate.

Eventually, after about 20 minutes, I started seeing a yellow, glowing light in my upper field of vision, like candlelight or a flashlight on a pendulum. I was startled and astounded, but attempted to observe the phenomenon in a detached manner as much as possible (just to confirm, I did open my eyes for a minute and, sure thing, the perception of light was not from an external source).

After continuing in this state for a few more minutes and contemplating the whole situation, I got up, and felt an extreme state of mindfulness; I was able to feel the intention of movement prior to the movement of my body, the individual ligaments and muscles, and was able to pinpoint the saccading motion of the eyes and the separate pictures that composed an image and the mental formation created out of that image.

I felt extremely excited and strange, and attempted to calm down by sitting down and doing a bit of zazen to just focus on the breathing instead of the euphoria of the moment. As I took each breath I felt them ten times as deep as usual, and felt like my whole self flowed with the breathing as a whole continuum instead of a process of inhaling and exhaling. Moreover my concentration was much sharper than I had ever felt.

This morning I woke up to do errands, and as I took the bus and subway I perceived a lot of things with a ""childlike"" mind, as if it was the first time I was seeing them. Everything was a lot more detailed; I saw microexpressions in people's faces. A subway that was felt before as dead and packed with inactive people was now bumbling with everyone doing something and expressing dozens of emotions.

As I waited in line, to finish my errands, as a simple test, I pulled out a tablet and played a little action game. I was able to immediately fall into the flow of the game. I could see my actions with complete clarity and no emotion, eventually finishing with a score ten times higher than what I get casually and none of the nervousness or excitement that inhibit it.

As a final close of the day, as I walked to class I was able to observe the visual formations that create the perception of things as moving by the wind, as if only a few features of a moving tree are what distinguish the idea of movement, and was suddenly struck with the insight to understand the following koan:

&gt;Two monks were arguing about a flag. One said: ""The flag is moving.""
The other said: ""The wind is moving.""
The sixth patriarch happened to be passing by. He told them: ""Not the wind, not the flag; mind is moving.""

It sounds ridiculous, but I remembered and the phrase felt perfectly clear in a way I had never understood emotionally before (and I don't quite understand now).

These sensations have subsided now and I feel rather normal now, but this was an incredible experience that's opened me up a lot towards dedicating myself to the spirit. At its height I was observing tens of notable activities of the mind between the deconstruction of movements, thoughts, vision, sound and touch (I ate an Oreo in the morning and it was the first time I actually managed to feel the texture of the cookie in my tongue). But I honestly don't understand how or why, since I've been meditating for so little time, especially with mindfulness.

It may not seem like anything special but I was able to meditate more effectively than ever before. The water temperature was 100 degrees but it was down pouring and the rain was probably only 60 degrees. I sat for probably 15 minutes listening to the world around.

I could feel the ebb and flow of the weather: hard rain, relax, hard rain, and so on. I felt my life is this pattern of stress and enjoyment, stress, and so on. I realized that my entire life is connected to the world around and that just as the world goes on in spite of hard rain, my life will go on in spite of hard times.

-----


The First Reason We Meditate – To Get In Touch With Reality

The art of meditation is a way of getting in touch with reality. The reason for it is that most civilized people are out of touch with reality, because they confuse the world as it is with the world as they think about it and talk about it and describe it. For, on the one hand, there is the real world and on the other a whole system of symbols about that world which we have in our minds. These are very useful symbols all civilization depends on them, but like all good things they have their disadvantages and the principle disadvantage is that we can confuse them with reality. Just as we confuse money with actual wealth. And our names about ourselves, our ideas of ourselves, our images of ourselves, *with* ourselves. Now of course reality from a philosophers point of view is a dangerous word. A philosopher will ask me, “What do I mean by reality? Am I talking about the physical world of nature? Or am I talking about a spiritual world? Or what?” And to that I have a very simple answer - when we *talk* about the material world, that is actually a philosophical concept. So in the same way if I say reality is spiritual, that’s also a philosophical concept, and reality itself is not a concept.

Reality is …(he bangs on a gong and we hear the noise resonate)… and we won’t give it a name.

Now it’s amazing what doesn’t exist in the real world. For example, in the real world there aren’t any things, nor are there any events. That doesn’t mean to say that the real world is a perfectly featureless blank. It means that it is a marvelous system of wiggles, in which we describe things and events in the same way as we would project images on a Rorschach blot or pick out particular groups of stars in the sky and call them constellations as if they were separate groups of stars. Well, they’re groups of stars in the minds’ eye, in our systems of concepts, they are not out there as constellations already grouped in the sky. 

So in the same way the difference between myself and all the rest of the universe is nothing more than an idea, it is not a real difference. And meditation is the way in which we come to feel our basic inseparability from the whole universe. And what that requires is that we shut up… That is to say that we become internally silent, and cease from the interminable chatter that goes on inside our skulls.

Because, you see, most of us think compulsively all the time - that is to say we talk to ourselves. Now obviously if I talk all the time, I don’t hear what anyone else has to say, and so in exactly the same way if I think all the time - that is to say if I talk to myself all the time - I don’t have anything to think about except thoughts. And therefore I’m living entirely in the world of symbols and I’m never in relationship with reality.

The Second Reason We Meditate – Meditation Doesn’t Have A Reason

This is going to be a little bit more difficult to understand. We could say that meditation doesn’t have a reason, or doesn’t have a purpose. And in this respect, it’s almost unlike all other things that we do, except perhaps making music and dancing. Because, when we make music, we don’t do it in order to reach a certain point, such as the end of a composition. If that were the purpose of music, to get to the end of the piece, then obviously the fastest players would be the best. And so likewise, when we are dancing, we are not aiming to arrive at a particular place on the floor, as we would be if we were taking a journey. When we dance, the journey itself is the point. When we play music, the playing itself is the point. And exactly the same thing is true in meditation.

Meditation is the discovery that the point of life is always arrived at in the immediate moment. And, therefore, if you meditate for an ulterior motive – that is to say, to improve your mind, to improve your character, to be more efficient in life – you’ve got your eye on the future and you are not meditating. Because, the future is a concept; it doesn’t exist. As the proverb says, “Tomorrow never comes.” There is no such thing as tomorrow; there never will be, because time is always now. That’s one of the things we discover when we stop talking to ourselves and stop thinking; there is only a present – only an eternal now. 

It’s funny then, isn’t it, that one meditates for no reason at all. Except we could say, ‘for the enjoyment of it,’ and here I would interpose the essential principal that meditation is supposed to be fun. It’s not something you do as a grim duty. The trouble with religion as  we know it, is that it is so mixed up with grim duties, ‘we do it because it’s good for you, it’s a form of self-punishment’. Well, meditation when correctly done has nothing to do with all that. It’s a kind of digging in the present; it’s a kind of grooving with the eternal now. And it brings us into a state of peace where we can understand that the point of life, the place where it’s at, is simply here and now.

But that's the thing. Meditation made me not give a care about anything serious; like, how I've been unemployed for a few months now.

On the flip side, I'm also worrying about the future. That whole 'living in the now' that I had last week is gone. I'm back to, ""will I ever get a job and move out of my parent's house?""

1336399649.0	tb63j	Focus on the empty space (xpost from r/Psychonaut)	TheDude1985	53	7	18	"I posted this is r/Psychonaut, but I'm curious to see if anyone in this subreddit has an interesting perspective.

======================

I'm currently reading ""The Power of Now"" by Eckart Tolle and one strategy that is briefly mentioned in the book as a way to maintain awareness in the present moment is to bring your focus on the empty space in the room.

I've been doing this for a while and it is very interesting. I guess that in ""normal"" or ""default"" conciousness, we tend to focus on ourselves (the I am) and other objects around us. What Tolle suggests is to instead focus on the empty space in the room you're in to break this pattern.

I've found that what happens when doing this is that I step-out of my ego. Instead of seeing the world from the point of view of the watcher inside my head, I'm beginning to see the world from the point of view of the emptiness itself. I see myself within the room almost as if I am the emptiness...almost like from a third-person perspective. I also feel more aware of the empty space between each object, and in fact within all objects themselves (as matter is mostly empty space).

I beleive this sensation might be a very low level of ego-loss. It's almost like removing myself from ordinary conciousness and tapping into some super-conciousness and then seeing myself from that perspective. This is only intensified when I've done this and smoked cannabis.

Has anyone else ever tried this method of raising awareness or experienced something similar?

Meditation has proved to cause various beneficial frequencies in the brain and thus improve brain's neural connections. If Alzheimer's and alcoholism can cause that kind of actual damage, it would be interesting to see the effect of the ""opposite"".

It usually takes me at least fifteen minutes just to get my mind calmed down but I was able to get very relaxed very quickly. It was weird because it was almost like I was in a dream venturing through the darkness and within that darkness, substance appeared. I didn't feel like I was in my body, more of a being guiding myself through my subconscience. I really don't know how to describe it. I felt like I was on drugs, haha.

Savetonight	55	8	14	"After struggling with severe anxiety/depression for a while now I decided to try mindfulness meditation specifically concerning these feelings. I had been hesitant. Meditation was never a tool I used while *too* immersed in any negative feelings. I consider myself new to meditation (been doing it for years but I am inconsistent). 

I was able to visualize my anxiety/depression as something separate from myself. A force that acted on me but wasn't a part of me.  I'd always owned my anxiety and considered it a unavoidable part of who I am. By considering it something outside of me it suddenly seemed less all-encompassing.This breakthrough was so f-ing fantastic.

Now I'm hoping to hold onto this mindset.

Which, then goes to render said actions pointless...

However, i have a solution. A rather peculiar one.

As you breathe in and breathe out, imagine the air going through each digit in a hand. For example, as i breathe in i count 1, and imagine the breath being drawn from my left thumb. I then exhale, count 2 and imagine the air departing from my left index finger... and so on through both hands.

What is particularly interesting about this newly invented technique however is the fact that you instantly know when your mind begins to wonder because you lose count of what finger you are on and it sort of snaps you out of it. (in a mild state of confusion)

One day of newbie level work led me to an much needed revelation.	speaks_in_video	49	3	7	"For a great deal of my life, I've dealt with both social anxiety and depression and take medication. I dress like a punk, and act like a goth because the styles felt natural. 

Today, some dude on r/depression had provided a link to this sub. I had never considered meditation or thought anything of it. Because I had plenty of time to goof off, I spent about ten minutes in newbie-level meditation mode.

I've been ADD for years, and my minds always cluttered with thoughts. Either musics playing or depressing thoughts remain a constant in my subconscious. By the end of the ten minute period, my mind was comfortably clear. The feeling was similar to popping your ears after a long flight.

**HOWEVER** what I am truly grateful for was what meditation revealed to me. After the meditation, I went back to doing my homework and listening to music. Though my method of study hadn't changed, the music (Fuyuki, by JERO) actually energized me. Isn't wasn't just something to listen to, it was rhythmic and soothing. It made sense that music after 10 minutes of silence would result in a mood swing.

**BUT is wasn't about the music.** In 10 minutes, I achieved what months of medication and exercise couldn't accomplish. I made myself feel happy. Not indifferent. Not calm. Not somewhat content.

I just needed to let go of all the self-doubt and self-hate my mind cooks up for me each day. Though the effects didn't last long, for the first time in a long time, I felt happy.

I took meditation, yoga and a taichi class in college. I loved all 3 but never had the discipline to keep at it.

Now a few years later I've left America for Asia and, while I had been having a great time last winter overwhelmed me with stress. I started to feel kind of isolated, too worn out to put the energy into social things. I went through the motions but it all felt superficial, just the bare minimum. Started to get depressed and decided I had to try and do something to make a change.

I figured I would buy a yoga mat and put my college classes to use. I forced myself to be strict about it, 20 minutes of mindfulness meditation in the morning, a half hour of hatha yoga at night, then 10 minutes of pranayama and 20 minutes more of mindfulness meditation monday through friday.

This was about two months ago, I started seeing some results pretty quickly. Nothing huge but my anxiety really went down. I've started to gain some nicely toned muscle from the yoga (seriously, yoga muscles are great. All the stretching really keeps you from getting too bulky) and that made me feel a little more confident.

Now, like I said it's only been two months but still. I still go through normal emotions of course. I get stressed, I get down every now and then. I feel kind of meh right now because it's a kind of dreary day out. But it doesnt bother me as much.

This was all internal though. I didn't notice any change in my behavior and I wasn't too concerned about that in the moment. But here's the strange thing, OTHER people are acting a lot differently towards me.

Everyone keeps talking to me. I keep getting invited out by people who barely gave me the time of day before. A coworker I had a falling out with just... Invited me out to a party. She didnt invite the other coworkers and this was after months of us literally ignoring each other. It was a good time.

I just got back from a wedding, I had never met the bride or groom before but a person I barely know invited me. She spent the whole thing talking to me and not her husband (but he seemed really interested in me too.)

I honestly cant see what I'm doing differently, I still try and keep to myself, stay a quiet guy but it's almost impossible now.

So, what does meditation do to change your behavior, outward appearance or... Something? I'm positive this is common among meditators but does anyone have any insight into what it actually is?"	t5_2qnc9	True

Usually when I go for a run I've been doing it in intervals of 60 second run and a 90 second power walk alternating them until I've one ten 60 second runs. The other day when I went running I pushed myself (maybe this is where I went wrong, I do not know) and I just jogged/ran for as long as I could then took a little break of power walking, then ran again etc. After about half an hour of doing this I did some yoga, out in the park where I went running, during which I started to feel drained mentally the more I persevered with it so I decided to take a break and walked home and meditated out in my garden. As I was meditating I started to feel a bit apathetic and I tried to continue with focusing on my breath but the more I did the worse I felt and since then I've been feeling very directionless, not knowing what to do with myself, and all of my hobbies that I usually enjoy seem really mundane and boring and pointless.

One is that the brain state associated with ""happiness"" is higher among buddhists when they meditate, but it wasn't clear what type of meditation they were practicing.  I also remember reading about Zen monks who didn't habituate to pain when they were meditating.. for example.. stick them with a pin and the same response minute after minute with no habituation.

Some of the Zen guys make a big point that zazen is not meditation and that there is no goal so let your thoughts rip, just sit.  The Visipanna folks would have you concentrate on your breath and let thoughts go.

I can imagine vipassana yielding more calm and happiness over time, and zazen yielding more ""be in the momentness"" with more awareness of pleasant and unpleasant things.

With the mindfulness thing I don't really know a lot about it other than what he's told me, it's based on some stuff from Eastern philosophies but doesn't include any religion or anything like that and it's about training your mind. I'm hesitant now as I just got the letter this morning and need to call them to confirm I will be attending, the first session is in three weeks time and I want to go but my anxiety is starting to get the better of me a little.

Every time I get back up, I realize how all it takes is the slightest attachment to a thought. Attachment is like one drop of dye into a bowl of water: all it takes is one drop to change the color. If I can conquer my fears, I can tear down the invisible wall that prevents me from experiencing endless love. Just thought I'd share and thanks for reading.

I read the FAQ and searched, but I'm encountering a problem I didn't quite see answered, at least not yet. It's taken me awhile to even realize this is happening, but I feel like I am completely unable to silence my thoughts. If I do stop my thoughts from running away from me, it's not through silencing any voice, but rather having the voice harmonize with my breath if that makes sense? It doesn't *feel* like it's silent, just mimicking my senses. 

I have been working on this seriously for only 2 days now, but I've been working on silencing my mind for a few months just going throughout the day. It was going well, but now when I sit down to really do it, it becomes this gargantuan task of herding my mind-cats. 

I'm not articulating this very well, but I feel like my mind is running in a million different directions, and I have no concept of what it means to let the thought pass - it either takes my mind over for the moment I have it, then leaves when the next one comes along. I have no sense of ""identifying"" it until after-the-fact, and the thoughts of I have to resist the OTHER thoughts (self talk of ""focus on your breath, breathe"", etc), become distractions as well.

What can I do to battle this? I am setting an egg-timer for 7 minutes (all I can do at the moment), and sitting quietly in the lotus position with a fan on to block outside noise, and focusing on my breath. Should I be doing something differently? 

EDIT: WOW, thanks so much guys! I feel a lot better, and will stop expecting this to happen so quickly. A bunch of great advice from you all, upvotes for everyone!"	t5_2qnc9	True

1374417427.0	1ir21o	"Questions about the ""proper"" way to practice meditation."	cupatea	52	9	18	"Hello all, when I was younger, (in high school) I used to practice meditation, and now a few years later after significant mental and spiritual growth, I have spiked my interest again and have started to practice once more. 

 I have done some research on the internet about how to practice certain types of sitting meditation, notably anapanasatti and vipassanna.  What I have learned is that these types of meditation warrant that the practitioner simply focus on their breath, be mindful of their breath and only their breath in the duration of their meditation.  There should be no other thought processes that you try to practice, just simple mindfulness and focus of attention on the in and out of your breath.  

Am I doing it right?  I do feel that I am starting to notice some benefits from my practice.  Mostly in being able to monitor my thoughts better and to control or recognize any negative thoughts that might usually automatically come into my head and take control of my mind state.  I try to do 10 minutes once I wake up in the morning and 10 minutes later in the evening, so twice a day, 10 minutes each.  So is this the ""correct"" way to practice meditation?"	t5_2qnc9	True

1367345538.0	1dfbrg	Meditation to combat mental disturbance?	Mo3	51	8	15	"Sigh.

About a year ago, I took Magic Mushrooms in a remote forest with people I barely knew, continued tripping for 3 more days and lived through 3 months of pure hell, experiencing derealization, constant panic, racing thoughts, horrible anxiety, mental breakdowns and other not so fun mental crap. It's probably worth noting that I seemingly went through ego death, not completely but to a great degree. 

I've since gotten a little bit better, but some key symptoms persist:

 - Anxiety
 - Fatigue
 - Panic attacks
 - Depression
 - A very very ""fragile"" mind
 - Inability to focus and concentrate
 - Speech problems
 - Some light paranoia - this is the one thing I worry most about, I feel the constant need to lock my apartment door even though there's absolutely no need to. I know that this could potentially be a very serious symptom of mental illness, but I can assure you that I'm still somewhat rational and level-headed.

Long story short, the state of my mental health is suboptimal and my mind appears to be very disturbed and fragile. 

Now, I have some experience with meditation and feel like I could greatly benefit from it, but I also reckon that I have to be EXTREMELY careful. Since I experienced partial ego death and my ego still didn't really forgive me for that, I assume that any sort of ego-dissolving meditation technique could lead me down a path I don't really want to go down, especially when it leads to psychosis or similar serious mental health issues.

Is there any form of meditation that could benefit me and help restore my mental health?

This morning I decided that I wanted to try just sitting with no tone at all. It was actually really awesome &amp; I found myself being able to focus on my breath so much easier. I was more aware of my body &amp; my breath &amp; even though there were noises going on outside, even they didn't really pull me away much at all, they all just blended in to the background. I found when I previously heard outside noises over the top of my headphones, they would pull my focus away more because I was hearing them more as intruders into my little tone bubble. When I was using the tone I noticed my mind was flitting around so quickly &amp; haphazardly. I know this is natural in some sense &amp; it is what we are trying to free ourselves from in the first place but taking off the headphones slowed it way down. It didn't disappear of course but it definitely seemed a lot less insane. So glad I took off the headphones. (I should mention that I have begun to meditate early in the morning before everyone starts waking up &amp; doing yard work/talking etc. It is so much more pleasant although I think with time my ability to focus on my meditation with more outside distractions will only grow stronger.)

"	WakingChild	47	5	9	"Hi redditors !

First of all, I would like to thanks this subreddit which made me discover meditation, and helped me understand it.

I don’t write often, but when I do, it’s because something touched me inside very profoundly. And that’s what meditation is doing.

 

Why did I start meditation ? It’s dumb ! I’m a person who has very frequent nosebleed, especially those last months and I put it on too much stress. At the time, I thought that I should do something to control my emotions, to calm down the inner-me. And that’s how I came to meditation.

 

I must say that the hardest part, when I started to meditate, was to sit there and do nothing but concentrating on my breathing for 10-20 minutes. But today, it’s a moment I truly enjoy.

 

I know I didn’t meditate for much long but I can already feel the changes inside me. I feel much more at peace with myself, confident. I’m no more stressful about the day that’s coming, no more making big deals of things that shouldn’t take these proportions. Today, I could picture myself as a quiet ocean.

 

The other benefit is, as I meditate just before going to bed, my nights are better, deeper. I succeed in getting rid of all these thoughts that keep you awake. I don’t know if it’s linked but I remember my dreams much more now.

 

Meditation is  a new step in my life, and I’m sure I couldn’t do without it anymore.

Tips and advice appreciated. 	reddizopter	43	1	32	"Backstory: I have extreme difficulty concentrating on tasks like schoolwork and job-work. Even tasks as simple as reading a book all the way through are difficult for me. Basically my mind is moving too fast to focus on one thing for long. I've tried just about everything I can think of, including medications and supplements, but without much results. 

Then I remembered back in 8th grade (I'm 25 now) a teacher once had us lay down in classroom with our eyes closed, took us through some breathing exercises, and talked us through a series of mental exercises like thinking about the future. It gave me an amazing feeling of calmness and clarity. I later figured out this was probably hypnosis. I've never been able to reproduce that feeling.

Anyway, I'd like to get your opinions, tips, strategies, suggested good books, suggested youtube videos, etc. I may not reply to all comments immediately but I will definitely read them all. Much appreciated!

to ""accept the ups and downs, the happy and the sad"" is an expectation. it just doesn't feel like it because it's also an established habit and a cultural norm.

with awakening comes the realization that these are merely reactions. They are not real. Only joy is real, because nothing causes it. It is always here.

I wish everyone could feel this. This is why I started meditating. I felt the joy in a yoga posture and it intrigued me in a deep deep way. I sought a more permanent experience of this through my sadhana, my daily meditations. It's now a reality for me. If I can do it, so can you.

We do cardio so we have a healthy heart. 

Usually we don't notice our heart at all. It just does it's thing in the background, pumping that good blood around. 

But sometimes we feel tired or out of breath - our heart may pound - or even worse - we might find ourselves getting tired all the time... or we might find ourselves gasping on the floor with a great pain in our chest.

We do cardio so this bad stuff won't happen. We give our heart some regular attention, do stuff that makes it healthier. We eat right and we exercise.

When we do cardio we discover something too. We discover that we have more energy and are happier. We find that we can do things that we couldn't do before. We can play all day. Yes, cardio not only keeps away bad stuff but it gives us alot of good stuff too.

Meditation is like cardio. We do meditation so we have a healthy awareness.

Like the heart, when we ignore our awareness it gets unhealthy - and then bad things happen. Low energy, sadness, confusion, lack of discipline. We might not even notice anything is wrong (being so used to this low state) until we blow up at somebody, or do something dumb.

So we meditate. We sit and do our thing every day. We maintain our awareness health.

Meditation is also like cardio in that if we do it, if we get a healthy awareness, then we discover new good stuff too. We become happier, smarter, more disciplined, more creative. We discover powers and freedoms that we never even thought of. New perspectives open.

**So let's all keep up with our cardio and meditation.**

For us, it’s gonna be that at, at a certain point, that we’re either gonna have to put away childish things and discipline ourself about how much time do I spend being passively entertained? And how much time do I spend doing stuff that actually isn’t all that much fun minute by minute, but that builds certain muscles in me as a grown-up and a human being? And if we don’t do that, then (a) as individuals, we’re gonna die, and (b) the culture’s gonna grind to a halt.

I guess i had trouble in the past just letting go of my thoughts, but i finally began to observe them for what they are. Most if not all of my thoughts are delusions, and by finally confronting them I came to the conclusion that the 'self' or 'I' that i refer to in my thoughts is just another thought! There is no independent 'self' that exists! Then, I became aware that awareness is omnipresent, and that I actually am this awareness. I realized that this false sense of identity (ego i guess) at the centre of my mind did not have to be there. Before I guess I relied on it to confirm my existence, which is kind of sad. I also realized that i am trapped within my mind and body, and ironically that was a freeing thought. At least now i know i'm trapped! I think i kind of just woke up and realized that i am living someone else's life, my life, but now i am aware that it does not revolve around the clustered self-absorbed thoughts that i identified with. Anyway, I was wondering if any of you had similar realizations. Also, are these insights legitimate, or am i reading too far into them?

TL;DR - I realized that i am awareness, and that the 'I' i have been referring to in my thoughts is, in fact, just a thought."	t5_2qnc9	True

This community and r/meditation are the best sources of teachings I've found. (Thanks!) On the other hand, while thinking about Reddit I've noticed some reoccurring behaviors in myself that I think are unskillful:

* **Pride** I think about how helpful, right, or intelligent my contributions are.

* **Craving** Sometimes I leave the moment and think about what I'll find or say here later.

* **Fear** I go over what I will say or have said worrying that it might be wrong or hurtful. Of course sometimes I get an insight that makes me realize that I should change something, but this goes beyond that.

* **Avoidance** I'll habitually browse because I'm trying to avoid doing something I'm adverse to or because I've become bored with the present.

I keep finding helpful information in the links and discussions, and I think I have legitimate thoughts to offer, so I'd like to stay. However, when I think about it, I'm doing each of those things all the time, including right now. :)

But after awhile, my thoughts seem to shift to my subconscious, and I feel like I'm no longer in control.

I have pretty extreme ADHD, and pretty much need to take medicine in order to function as a normal person. I take a lower dose than I used to, for problems like trouble sleeping and eating. I still have problems with both of those. I get very good grades, but can't ever finish homework due to procrastination. I get whatever I can do done in school and in other classes, but if its textbook homework, it never gets started. I used to do all of it, but I think having 1 grade that's not an A without doing any homework is good enough for slightly better hunger and sleep problems. I've been meditating for about a month, used to be nearly every day, for 11-20 minutes. After that it would be hard to focus, and even during I would do alright, but occasionally think about stopping prematurely. That is what most ADHD posts in this sub are about, and they all say just keep doing it, and you'll get better. But are there any specific tips? Other questions I have that are the main purpose of posting this: are there any mantras or meditation techniques for focusing so that I can maybe one day focus like I do with medicine without? Also, is there a mantra or technique that would help with sleeping? The only mantras or techniques I've tried are sat nam..., ohma..., Ong na mo... And putting my hands on my heart, in opposite arm pits, or on knees with palms facing up. Ive also tried silent mediation once before, don't think I did it correctly. If it helps, I do smoke marijuana. Not as much as I have previously, but I've read that can help to focus on meditation. What do you guys think about while meditating, just breathing? Last question I have is where do you guys mediate? I have been on my floor, and I don't find it ideal. On my bed doesn't have enough support either. What clothing do you wear? And are there any songs or artists you listen to while meditating? I've listened to Godspeed you! Black emperor and shpongle both once. I didn't feel like it was beneficiary to the meditation process. Thanks for reading!!

TL;DR- are there any mediation mantras or techniques to help me one day not rely on ADHD medicine to get me through school? Are there any mantras or techniques to help go to sleep? What do you guys think about while meditating, just breathing? Where do you meditate for comfort? What do you wear? Do you listen to music? If so, what music? Thanks guys!!"	t5_2qnc9	True

About 3 months in, (meditating for about an hour) I began to have some amazing experiences...a strong feeling of love, a sense of oneness that would last for long after the meditation was over.  I would just focus on that feeling when it appeared during the meditation.  

The thing I noticed, though, was that I was very irritated when things came up and interrupted that feeling and sense.  After thinking about it, I began to wonder if this was what I wanted and wondered if I was just heading down a manic/depressive road, something that I was prone to before I started meditating.  I decided to back off and meditate for 30 minutes and add 10 minutes here or there during the day to keep myself more down on the earth and less prone to swings.  Seems to have helped.

1370914509.0	1g36vg	My experience with meditation and depression	srfsdr	43	5	15	"Hello everyone,

I am new to meditation. I went to a 10 week Vipassana course on May 1st and this was my first real dive into meditation. It was much more than I expected. I thought it was going to be a technique I could use to escape life's troubles. Instead I was facing my own ""demons"" right up front.

It was really good for me, I felt great afterward for a few days. The depression did come back, full force. But I really realized how much work I have to do, how deeply stuck I am in my own ruts of depression-related thoughts. One negative thing starts a cascade of self-judgement and that leads into just feeling flat-out depressed for weeks on end.

Depression is something I've dealt with all my adult life (23 now, depression felt at 15  or so). At the meditation course, I didn't feel depressed until the 7th day when I had a negative reaction to something and when the depression came back full force it felt like slipping on an old jacket. It feels like I'm so used to this that I want to be depressed. I know the routine of depression so well and to just casually slough it off feels impossible. 

Vipassana meditation hasn't really made my depression better per se, it might actually be harder for me now that I'm more aware of my thoughts, emotions and associated physical sensations. But one thing it has done for me has reduced my anxiety to almost zero. I always thought I had anxiety first which led to depression. That's not the case, and I'm grateful for this piece of self-knowledge.

My experiences with Vipassana has also taught me about the transient nature of my own emotional states. I can feel depressed and then I can feel not-depressed, or even happy without any input or control from me or anything external. It is very comforting to know that I don't have to do anything at all and eventually I will feel better. In the past I would always attribute feeling better to an external factor, and when feeling bad I would always seek something to try and make me feel better. Now I realize these states can just come and go without anything added/subtracted.

This knowledge still hasn't kept me from being depressed or trying to seek out a way out of my depression. I'm fine being sad just by myself. The problem is interacting with other people. I don't want to spread my misery around. I feel pressure to be sociable and smiling and I feel like I'm being a bad son/brother/friend if I'm not. However, I feel optimistic that I can beat this now. I can see clearly now what is going on in my head and my emotions. This I believe is an important first step. I felt very lost and confused before, and now I feel like if I keep working, I have a way out.

 I thought meditation would lift me out of depression effortlessly, I realize now that this was naive, that this is really just exemplar of my thought-patterns that everything should be easy or else it's not worth doing. Instead, meditation is way, way more work than I had thought. You have to come face to face with yourself. But so far, I think it's been worth it. My parents have told me, unprovoked, that they see a difference in me. I feel like my personal relationships are really improving.

I've definitely become more mindful of my thoughts throughout the day and this helps to relax me, however sometimes I get hung up on the idea that ""I am not my thoughts"" or ""I don't have to believe in my thoughts."" This mostly comes up when I experience thoughts of lust, guilt or anxiety. Strong emotions, essentially.  How are these thoughts not associated with who I am? I think they derive from a lack of self-esteem, but that's the only ""me"" I know, if that makes sense. If I continuously tell myself not to believe my thoughts, then what's left of me? I'm afraid I'll become someone with no opinions or personality of my own because I've abandoned the things I ""identify"" with. Maybe I have it all wrong, and I hope I do.

I find in this subreddit there are many questions and even resistance to thinking while meditating.  While I understand a big goal of meditation is to ""clear the mind"" I enjoy thinking positive thoughts and visualizing about life while in a relaxed meditative state.  I will sometimes visualize swimming, being on a beach, flying etc.  On the mind wandering I think this is my natural tendency at times to process the days and past days events in a relaxed state so I do not mind when my mind does wonder.  When I catch myself wondering a lot I internally say this is good for me to get it processed and out of the way.  

My mediation sessions are only 10 minutes where I lay on my back with eyes closed and visualize numbers counting down timed with my breaths, say from 50 to 1.  That is my structured way to relax and after that  I concentrate on my breath, a positive mental image or place or just let the mind do its thing.

I realize this is a somewhat unorthodox way to meditate but it is my way and I enjoy it.  Just remember, it is good to get a formalized way of meditating or read about how it's done and then do it on your own terms.  For me this isn't about ""maximizing"" mindfulness/meditation or whatever else, it is about relaxation, decompression, and acceptance."	t5_2qnc9	True

This being human is a guesthouse.

A joy, a depression, a meanness.

Some momentary awareness 

Comes as an unexpected visitor

Welcome and entertain them all! 

Even if they're a crowd of sorrows

Who violently sweep your house

Empty of its furniture.

Still treat each guest honorably;

He may be cleaning you out 

For some new delight!

Meet them at the door laughing,

And invite them in.

This sometimes gets frustrating, either because I no longer follow the ""groupthink"" or ""group-way/view"" because I consider it counterproductive or ""unmindful"" and I thus get detached from the situation and people in it, and as I'm not perfect I sometimes get judgmental and criticize; or I get aware of people's repeating thought patterns and just get bored because their way of thinking becomes cyclical and predictable; or worse I sometimes feel like I put myself in situations where I lose other's respect because, in brief terms, my trying to be mindful of the way I behave no longer establishes a gorilla-alpha-male-ego-don't-tread-on-my-turf vibe...

Now maybe I can talk about it with certain friends and family, but most times they make me feel like I'm trying to sell them on Scientology - and in most environments, like work, it's not a recommended subject.

SentimentalGentleman	46	15	17	"I have been avoiding my first 'try out' for a few weeks now, casually lurking this subreddit and downloading some helpful audio books. Audio books which have still remained un-listened. The thing that made me say 'yes' was that I had some things that I needed to straighten out. I was putting lots of things, happenings and thoughts on a big heap, and I needed to sort it out because I have been avoiding things last monday and today.

I sat down on my bed, and I probably had all kinds of wrong form but that's something to focus on later. I tried to watch my breathing, and soon I became more focused on my thoughts than the tempo in which I took my breaths. I quickly noticed how sharp my thoughts became, this was something different than when I think before going to sleep. I tend to think before I fall asleep and try to find solutions that way, but the difference between that and this was *energy* that was present. 

I started untangling this knot of things that had developed these few months. After a while, I had unraveled everything: 

* The job interview that went well, placing me in the last 4/5 out of 100 applicants

* A freelance assignment that I'm just starting

* My future (where I'll live/where I'll travel next year/getting a motorcycle or car/relationships)

I'll try to keep it short, so I won't type it out any further unless I'm asked. 

Some conclusions:

- I did not discover any fears or suppressed memories. This was not a big surprise, I tend to think I have lots of aspects of my life under control.

- It was easier to 'get into the flow', these 15 minutes went by quickly.

- It was easy to stay on topic, it felt like I was in control. My thoughts were clear. 

- This is way more effective than (over)thinking stuff in bed, while trying to sleep. I sorted out more stuff in 15 minutes than I would in 2 hours in my bed.

- After I was done, the colors of things all around my room were suddenly more vibrant and seemed more saturated. I felt clean and sharp. 

- It's 21:44 in the evening but I feel like doing stuff. I can see myself doing this in the morning to get started the right way.

That's it, it might not seem like much but I hope this will inspire someone to go and do this. Any tips on form/breathing/etc are appreciated but I think I'll find what I need in the sidebar.

I've been attending a weekly Buddhism/meditation course for a few weeks now, and I've had spur-of-the-moment ""I'm going to start meditating!!"" sessions, but for the most part I haven't made an effort.

The reason for this was apparently quite clear to me - naturally when you spend a long time reading and looking up meditation on the Internet, you come across stuff about the ""dark night"" and ""seeing suffering in everything,"" which of course sounds not very pleasant at all. So of course, every time I would TELL myself to start meditating, I would chicken out and make excuses. When I was feeling good, I would say things like ""Yeah, meditate bro, all that dark night shit is just bogus!"". When I was feeling bad and scared, however, I would say things like ""don't start at all, it's not worth it, it's better just to feel like shit and cope than potentially fuck your mind and deal with the consequences."" But no matter how much I said either of those things, I felt like I never really believed them.

Come back to today, and i finally started the basic mindfulness of breathing meditation after much deliberation. And, low and behold, these thoughts of seeing suffering and becoming depressed popped into my head. So I start feeling like shit after my meditation session, but then my aunty asked how I was feeling. I don't really believe in keeping things inside, so I told her that I was feeling fearful after meditating.

And suddenly, after a few moments, I understood exactly what I was fearful of. Change. I am terrified of change. It's not the threat of a dark night that scares me, it's the change in perception that comes with meditation. And now I realize this seeps into all aspects of my life. I tell myself I WANT to start exercising, but I never make an effort to do it. I tell myself I WANT to learn a new language, but it's always just a thought, not a goal. 

This has been an incredible insight, and this was just from a single session. When they talk about ""insight meditation,"" I always thought this meant just insight into the nature of reality and the universe, but now I understand that it means all sorts of insights, no matter how small.

If I can get this relieving feeling of understanding and progress just one day, imagine what I can get in ten, or a thousand.

Whenever I smoke cannabis before I meditate, it's like nothing I could achieve while sober.  When I'm sober and I meditate, it's a constant stream of thoughts.

When I meditate high, I have this awareness of my thoughts and their relationship to the actual reality of the situation from some type of all-knowing perspective.  As well as the ability to fully feel the sensations of the breath.  I can sustain this stilled awareness and whatever thought comes up will automatically be noticed, then reached to its logical outcome given my current situation and the situation the thought is about.  Then back to the breath, still possessing and applying this knowledge but not thinking about it.

When I meditate sober, it is just a constant struggle of my mind trying to think my way into meditation, with no awareness of my futile efforts to do so, nonetheless can I stay focused on the breath or any of my 5 senses.  I have always had problems with ADD aka not being able to focus, so this is nothing new.  When someone who has ADD (or as some might call it: monkey mind) closes their eyes, it is the perfect opportunity for your mind to think about literally everything that is and was in your consciousness in the recent past, *more than once*.

I'm not trying to rely on cannabis for meditation, or rely on it for anything really.  I would rather not.  Believe me, if I could just have relaxed and concentrated meditation while sober I would gladly give it up.  However, my experiences just constantly validate the notion that sober me is less aware than high me by a huge margin.

I realize that the vast majority of them are either negative or unproductive. Many deal with what I have to do next, what work is left, where I have to be in a few days, many are fantasized conversations with friends about myself or opinions I have, others might be negative about people I see around me, and many others are just negative about myself - I didn't do a good job on this thing, I'm too uncomfortable in this or that situation.  Also, many worries that I'm too old (I'm 30) to change things now, or how others might be happy while I'm not.

Now that I'm aware of my thoughts, I want to begin changing them, to fill my mind with good thoughts, compassionate about others, or peaceful thoughts, or even thoughts about kittens and bunnies, anything positive! So many of my thoughts - like, almost ALL of them - are about ME, and I want to free myself from that, or at least have positive ones.

Some say it's a must to practice one of the traditional poses, especially as you progress to longer and longer sessions (to prevent legs from falling asleep and back straight, probably some other reasons too). 

In aforementioned book, he suggests working through any pain in these positions and eventually it'll get better. I've been trying to meditate in the burmese position and this seems to be the most recommended one for beginners. I only have a little pain in my hip but it's not sharp or anything, more of just a stretch and it's easy to ignore. My issue with these positions is I can never fully relax my legs. Sometimes my left leg will just start twitching/shaking uncontrollably. I've been trying this for a week and it hasn't got any better and has made it impossible to just sit and focus.

I personally find the most comfortable position sitting on my heels (but I have to cross my heals under by butt, which I've heard at least one person say is not advisable).

When I first started meditation and got involved in communities online, I would always read posts about people trying to ""kill"" their ego, vilifying that part of themselves to a ridiculous extent. Lately when I've been meditating, this has been at the forefront of my mind. Rather than try to kill my ego, I've come to accept it as a part of myself and my unique identity. The no-self belief system, while I can certainly understand its benefits, has never fully resonated with me; it's that type of puritanical mindset that has turned me off from meditation in the past. Along with being inclined towards secularism, I suppose it all makes sense why it never appealed.

Now for enlightenment, sure, who doesn't want to be enlightened to some capacity? But wanting to achieve that state, in my mind, completely defeats the purpose of being present and peaceful. I saw a post on here a while ago that said something like...

Before Enlightenment: chop wood, carry water

After Enlightenment: chop wood, carry water

Probably got that a little wrong, but hopefully you get the gist of it. It's silly to want this advanced state of being when we're all the same creature, who requires certain things to stay alive and endures the same fate as any other species.

1365947398.0	1cbp3l	My experience with running mindfully	beanieb	41	8	11	"About a week ago, I ran my first half marathon. I usually bring my phone with me to provide music, track my pacing, etc. However, around mile 8, my music stopped. I assumed that my phone was dead, and was thrown off guard. I had run 1, maybe 2 miles without music, but never 5. The rest of the half seemed daunting but I knew I had to do it. There was no quitting. I decided to apply some mindfulness to my running, paying attention to my breath, my footsteps, the really loud thoughts telling me to stop, the feel of the breeze and sun on my skin, and the sound of the wind through the trees. I won't say it made my run easier; in fact, it was probably quite the opposite. I didn't have my method of ""zoning out"". I couldn't reach to the music for motivation. I had to find that within myself. My pace slowed down a bit, but I finished, and I felt exhilarated. And although it was harder, I think I got a lot more out of it.  

So this weekend, I decided to give it another shot. However, instead of being thrown off guard, I wanted to do it with intention. I set out to run 5 miles with my phone on just to track via GPS, with no music. I noticed something strange. When I'm doing sitting meditation, my breath usually goes in-out-pause, with no pause at the top of the breath. It's almost as if my breath just does a U-turn. However, when my breathing got more labored as I ran, my breath went out-in-pause, as my body was trying to get more oxygen. I was able to breath into areas of my body that started cramping up, observe the discomfort, and let them go. I intentionally noticed what my body and mind were feeling when I wanted to stop and walk. I noticed almost a sense of boredom, of wanting to give up, and I tried my best to take those in a non-judgmental manner and just keep going. 

I think mindfully running really brought back to me what running is all about. Pushing your mind and body to its limits. Just wanted to share. 

TL;DR: Ran mindfully, was really difficult but noticed some pretty neat things that I hadn't noticed before. "	t5_2qnc9	True

1348145537.0	106tve	As a beginner my mind drifts a lot during meditation, but this had led to very creative insights.  Will these stop or slow down as my focus improves?	Sinazri	39	7	11	"I do basic breathing meditation which just involves focusing on my breath, and returning my focus to it when it drifts to other thoughts.  The aim of this was to improve my attention and to relieve stress with the hope of improving my cognitive abilities.  Since I am a beginner, my mind drifts a fair bit, but rather than this being disappointing (as I first thought it would) I am incredibly amazed at what my mind is drifting to!  

In this relaxed state it seems that I unlock all of these past memories ranging from last week back to when I was 5 years old (I'm 22 now), and this seems similar to what I've heard about hypnosis being used for.  I've also heard a lot of people say that just before they go to sleep memories from long ago pop into their head so I guess this is probably similar.  Furthermore, during the actual meditation my creative ability seems to be massively enhanced and out of nowhere creative insights will appear about concepts which I have been reading, and I start making creative links between unrelated things, especially in terms of analogies.

This is amazing, but since the point of doing meditation was to improve my focus by quietening my mind, I can practice more that my mind will drift less and I will experience less creative insights! :(  I've heard of a causal link between focus and creative ability:  since creativity relies on you making connections between unrelated areas, the ability to focus i.e. concentrate on a particular thing, inhibits your creative ability because your brain no longer flits between things as much?

I would really like to gain the benefits meditation has on focus, while at the same time getting to relive so many of this cool memories and make these creative insights!  How can I do this?"	t5_2qnc9	True

I'll present my problems, hopefully some of you will have answer, but I guess I need to know how long does this take? How long does one need to try meditation for before they are successful? 

All of my sessions have been riddled with problems. Starting with the basics of breathing, where am I supposed to be focusing? Should I be focusing on the fact that I'm breathing in, out, in, out? Or on feeling the air in my nose? Either way, I've found it nearly impossible, perhaps because of my ADD (with or without medication makes no difference, at least that I've noticed). 
Note: I try meditation with nothing normally, but I've had the same results with both music and guided meditation. 

A few times I have noticed myself shaking very slightly while attempting to relax my muscles. I haven't found a position yet that works for me. The standard lotus/half lotus aren't plausible, as I have a huge curve in my back (which I am working on, stretching/working out). What can I do to relax my muscles?

If it helps anyone, there are a few reasons I'm meditating. The first being trying to live in the moment. I can't remember the last time I've been ""in the moment"". Maybe as far back as 4 or 5 years ago. I just don't get the satisfaction of doing anything, and am generally very emotionless. I frequently don't answer people when they talk to me, because I don't see a reason to stop thinking and answer them. 

The second reason being relaxing. Despite not living in the moment, I still seem to be terrified subconsciously of many social situations. When at home, I'm perfectly fine, but when I'm out in public, with people, I tend to sweat a lot. The same thing will also happen at home when playing video games (competitively), so my assumption is that I'm very tense. 

I hope I didn't forget anything.

I felt like up to that point I wasn't hearing music, while it was on I just kept replaying on my mind and was actually hearing my mind and not the music.

1307067056.0	hqfnd	Interesting technique for closing the mind-body gap	rhinosaur	37	5	15	"My girlfriend and I were doing a 2-hour meditation session earlier this week. The discussion we had afterwards was interesting to me, and I want to know if anyone's ever heard of this sort of technique.

She asked me if I've ever meditated by treating my brain as if it were a muscle. She proceeded to explain an interesting mental cue that I had never considered. She said, ""just relax the train of thoughts by relaxing your brain the way you would a muscle. Just don't flex it, don't let it it expand or contract."" Now, before you start objecting, let me say that the brain is obviously not a muscle, nor does it operate in the same way--I'm not making any anatomical or biological claims here. Just pretend it does for the cue. 

I like this cue because for me one of the big things about meditation is that it discloses the unity of two entities that are normatively opposed to one another as ""mind"" and ""body."" As such, having a separate instruction for my mind than for my body only reinforces the gap through methodological dissonance. I'm talking about typical mindfulness instructions like ""focus on the breath"" or ""label thoughts as 'thoughts' and then let them go."" 

It's not that I imagine an image of my brain relaxing; rather it is that I attempt to reproduce in my skull the sensation of a relaxing muscle, as if I released all tension in my arms and let them hang to my side. I notice that when I do this, not only do thoughts dissolve effortlessly, but the dissolution is accompanied by a wave of relaxation across my entire nervous system. 

My dreams have for a while indicated to me that gaining control over my 'mind' is much the same as gaining control over my 'body'--I'm only beginning to understand now what these dreams mean.

Zylence	49	15	12	"I must profess that this line of thought began ironically (or not depending on how you look at it) during an afternoon meditation. I had sat there for around 10-15 minutes with my mind going near the speed of a humming bird's wings. For those who have tried any form of meditation this experience should be familiarly unpleasant. Often, meditators experience a very profound level of awareness, silence or being upon trying it out for the first time. As time goes on, this tends to become the expectation upon closing the eyes and any lack of relaxation often becomes a “failed mediation attempt”. Here you are trying to relax yourself and all that is happening is thought after thought about tomorrow, traveling and tits. 

“Alright, fuck it, time to get back to working or whatever,” doesn't usually take long to inject itself into the ongoing stream babbling through the brain. Feeling none too refreshed and more than a little impatient ""fuck it"" was about to become a reality. Something suddenly triggered in me and the word ""practice"" bubbled to the top of my consciousness. Momentarily diverted from the “fuck it” fork of consciousness I sat back while my mind explored what practice means to me and why this word should catch my attention.

I had gone to the gym earlier today, as per usual, and struggled with a new personal record weight on a lift. I failed to move it a number of times and planned to unload the bar and move on. I decided to go for it once again as a matter of principle with no expectations. This time I got the weight off the floor about an inch before having to release. Satisfied with busting that smaller mental wall of at least moving the damn thing I unloaded a little of the weight and repped out 5 of a challenging amount I could move as practice. 

Practice - the condition of being proficient through systematic exercise.

“Remember your practice” or “always do your practice” are phrases commonly heard by teachers when referring to the act of meditation. Bingo! Talk about light bulb moment. As an individual who has stopped and started the practice of meditation numerous times over the course of 14 years I rarely, if ever, have looked at mediating as practice of anything. Today, with this idea spontaneously in mind I put a gentle intent on going towards a more settled state to practice becoming quieter. Low and behold, the mental chatter began to dissipate and the familiar and wonderful feeling of what I would have previously defined as a “good” mediation pervaded.

**TL:DR**
After today I think I'll be retiring the terms “good mediation” and “failed, bad or unsettled” meditation. There is simply practicing mediation and not practicing."	t5_2qnc9	True
1371233847.0	1gcppf	I caught a glimpse of enlightenment as a kid and I have never been able to replicate it.	Villipoto	48	17	44	"Maybe not enlightenment. When I was young, my favorite 'me time' was smoking good pot and listening to The Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd. As loud as humanly possible. It relaxed me to the point once where I felt as if I was starting to float from my chair. My mind was totally blank, when I felt like I was a few feet from the chair, I got scared and opened my eyes. The fear wasn't really of falling, but where I was going. The floating feeling wasn't a good feeling, it was the absence of it. It was the most profound experience of my life and it lasted maybe 10 seconds.

I have eaten acid, mushrooms, peyote...anything that makes you trip. I had profound spiritual experiences while tripping, but nothing even close to the absence I felt that day. I got into Yoga a few years back and the end of a good hour of yoga and I am contemplating and relaxing at the end, is closer to the feeling I had that day.

Now I really don't think I can clear my thoughts. My family is sort of unhealthy right now and I moved back in with my folks to help out. We have a great attitude but impending doom is draining me. I think I have health issues myself so pain for me is what keeps me from being clear headed. I close my eyes(no pot nowadays) and try to clear my thoughts. Fantasy and greed and temptation and stress and money is all that keeps popping in there. I am not serious enough about my state of mind, I mean I don't read up on meditation or practice it beyond the point of frustration. 

Now that I know there is a path, I am twisted inside thinking I have grown into a man that cannot get back on it.

1370194485.0	1fj0on	Meditated with my mom, surprising results.		38	3	4	"Well I asked a couple days ago how I can introduce meditation to my mom. I went ahead and approached her about it yesterday, we had a talk, and surprisingly she agreed to do it. I essentially told her about the benefits of meditation and even Dr. Oz recommends it! (she religiously watches that guy). I told her the best time is first thing in the morning, so we did it this morning. 

At first, I went online searching for a guided meditation because I thought it would be easier to follow along. None of them seemed right. Not intending insult, but my mom isn't the brightest person I've met and her English is poor, she isn't exposed to much English except me and television. The spirituality and philosophical stuff would confuse her and distract her so I decided I would just guide her through it myself. She needs someone to hold her hand.

We just sat on the couch. I thought sitting on the floor would be distracting (focusing too much on posture, kind of uncomfortable). I talked to her about some preliminary stuff:
 
- meditation is about awareness and acceptance
- don't concentrate too hard, don't frustrate yourself, just don't fall asleep
- in most people's lives, they aren't even aware of the thoughts and feelings in their heads, so it ends up overwhelming and stressing them, when we meditate, we can clearly see what's going on inside of ourselves, after that, we can learn to accept all of it
- the main thing i want you to do for the next 10 minutes is look at your thoughts, your feelings, any kind of sound in the environment like the air conditioner or the fan or the wind or the neighbor's dog barking, the rising and falling of your chest as you breathe, the feel of your clothing, aching in your body
- if you're sad that's okay, if you're happy, that's okay, if you start remembering bad things from long ago, that's okay, if i sneeze or cough, that's okay, if you get itchy somewhere, that's okay, just scratch it and move on. Whatever happens, whatever you feel, just look at it, then gently bring your attention back, don't push away thoughts and feelings, just look at them. 

I started by getting her to to sit up straight, hands on knees, get the posture right. Then we took some deep breaths in through the nose, out the mouth. Incoming breath energizes the body, outgoing breath relaxes the body. I took her through a body scan next, starting at the head working down to the foot. Then I took her through the ""outside"" of the body, the weight of the body on the cushion, the gentle flow of air from the fan, the feel of clothing. Next I told her to listen to any sounds, my breathing, the fan, dogs, A/C. A few more deep breaths again. 

I wasn't sure what to do next, so I just told her to notice any thoughts and feelings going through her head, acknowledge each one, then gently let it go, don't force it away. Don't think of them as good or bad, they're all just thoughts, nothing more. We did that for maybe 2 minutes. In the middle if reminded her if you're distracted, that's okay, bring your attention back. 

Some deep breaths again, another quick body scan, then another short period of looking at thoughts. 

I told her to open her eyes, and she said, ""Wow, I feel much better. My head is different."" 

I recapped what I said before we started, trying to teach her there's a better way to live. Had a really long conversation after that.

She starts talking to me about things that have been bothering her, lots of things I would consider silly shit that doesn't even matter to anything in the grand scheme of things. I just listened, and reminded her that whether or not we have control over bad things that happen, we always have control over how we feel about it, and we can train ourselves to do that with meditation. 

She got really touchy feely, asked me if I thought she was a bad mother, and said she made a mistake marrying her ex-BF etc. Started crying. I just listened.

She has some issues (me as well I guess), and in the past, I just got pissed at her and the arguments escalated into screaming matches and destroying things. She hallucinates sometimes, obsessively dwells on things, has mood swings, chronic headaches. She won't go see a professional, so I hope I can help her a little. 

I told her there's a place downtown we can go to learn another kind of meditation and it's open to the public. She agreed that we can go check it out (really surprising). I didn't tell her it's a Zen Buddhist temple/house because she's a devout Catholic, but they have this weekly thing where they teach the public how to meditate and it's in a regular house.

Generally, I have meditated for around 15 minutes once a day for more than half the days this month.

It feels like being faint and light-headed, but in a pleasant way. When it happened during meditation it lasted around a whole minute and was an incredibly pleasant feeling. My body felt as if it was floating and i felt extremely light-headed. There was a slight tingling sensation everywhere, and my head felt a strange throbbing.

I have been practicing meditation and mindfulness for the last 7 months and this has made me much more calm in social situations, but I'm also now attuned to how toxic my friend's , families and acquaintance's  minds are. They cannot keep a silence for more than 5-10 seconds, and if there is nothing to say they'd prefer to either complain about something, put someone/thing down or comment on something that doesn't need to be said.  Do you guys have any tips on to how to keep the conversation upbeat, full of laughter and joy? 

More specifically to my situation, my friends are generally 22 year old males and have trouble speaking to women. A few of them are virgins and it seems things aren't going to change. I'd like to approach women in bars and clubs and often do, but they're too scared to have fun with me. They'd rather sit at a table and put each other down and have a boring but safe time.

I want to get the most out of my social interactions and I want them all to be positive, happy and creative, but it seems hard, especially if I remain quiet and let the interaction carry its course amongst themselves. Should I aim to 'steer' the conversation in a particular direction? Also I live with my mother and she goes nuts sometimes for no reason, irrational shouting, complaining etc. How should I treat this? No matter what I do I'm wrong in her eyes (even though I do nothing wrong, or do something very minor).

I recognize that the very essence of creating a Me vs. Them (I am a meditator vs. they are not) is an ego-construct so I don't really think of it as a big deal that they don't meditate, but it's obviously a factor in how calm their minds are when they are communicating with me."	t5_2qnc9	True

I had some mild panic attacks a few months ago, decided to pick up meditation to help with my anxiety (I've always had an interest, but the panic attacks pushed me over the edge).

I read Mindfulness in Plain English and really started getting into it. (Do at least 20min / day). I wanted a better source so I picked up [Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche's The Joy of Living](http://www.amazon.com/The-Joy-Living-Unlocking-Happiness/dp/0307347311/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1339249608&amp;sr=1-1) and read it front to back in about a week. It really opened my eyes and I've started becoming aware of my thoughts throughout the day.

During my journey, I started noticing my emotions surface and I became much more emotional (cried for the first time in 10 or so years) and went into a huge depressed state. I have since become much more at ease with my emotions. 

However, about a week ago, I started noticing a change in my thought process. I've adopted a much more ""fuck it"" (pardon the words) attitude as far as my thoughts/emotions go. Whenever a negative thought or emotion passes by, I just let it carry itself out. I have noticed my self-confidence SOAR through the roof. I've started occasionally feeling that equanimity that is a byproduct of meditation.

My question to you is, is this normal? I feel like I'm making too much progress too fast. I realize that I should not attach myself to these feelings of happiness and let them pass by just like any other emotion. But is it ok to enjoy the ride for a bit so to speak? Is it possible that I might be manic-depressive?

Thank you for taking the time to answer. I tried to be as concise as possible."	t5_2qnc9	True

I practice Vipassana, and feel I have made some progress with it. Since joining the local group I have been on 7 retreats ranging from weekend to six weeks. While on retreat I am able to really focus on my meditation, and get really into it sitting 8 - 10 per day on the cushion. 

But when I get home I tend to quickly fall back into old habits and conditions. I eat like crap, spend most of my time watching movies and playing games and let my practice fall by the way side. I think most of it has to do with laziness, its just so much easier to be unconscious and let myself be distracted then go sit on the cushion.

I have not formally meditated in about 10 days since I got back from a recent 9 day retreat. I can really feel the effects on myself including anxiety and fear arising, yet I still continue to avoid the cushion.


While on retreat I always get the strong feeling or intention that meditation and working on bettering myself and working towards awakening is the only thing I should be doing with my life, so much that I feel I would love the monks life. But surrounded by all these distractions I just give in.

Any advice would be helpful, thank you.

I got a hint this morning that made me realize this meditation is beginning to work, beginning to bring out the better in me. I woke up this morning and meditated for about 30 mins. After sitting at my desk for 5-10 mins I remembered a part of a dream I had last night. I distinctly remember being outside somewhere near a boat dock. There was this little pole structure that had a little compartment at the top, a compartment made for hiding things (it was kind of like a mailbox). Curiously I opened it up and saw that there were bags full of weed in there and also a lot of money. Instinctively I would have grabbed all of it and stuffed it into my pockets thinking to myself, ""wow i'm so lucky that i found this stuff"". But instead, I thought to myself, ""this stuff isn't mine"" and actually felt good about leaving it there and not taking it. The last thing I remember is walking away feeling great about what I had mentally accomplished. 

Hope this story provides some sort of motivation for the people who have any doubts that meditation does not help. So far I've learned that it is a truly patient process, the more you want to change the harder it will be. Just plant your ""happiness"" seeds and let time take its course. Sooner or later you will start to notice your seeds grow and transform into beautiful healthy plants.

1371216756.0	1gc4hj	Update: First Vipassana Experience	WKUBigRed	42	11	11	"This is in reference to my earlier post: http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1f7d1l/leaving_for_first_vipassana_meditation_tomorrow/

Here's my summary on my 10 day silent retreat if you're interested. Sorry if it's long.

     4AM and my day has started. I jump out of my uncomfortable bed and begin my morning routine, walking outside into the pitch black night in Jesup, Georgia. I walk around the retreat, through the trees and over to the pond where I sit calmly, gazing at the stars. They’re much more beautiful out here compared to the city. As I head back to the trailer, which I share with seven other silent men, I see the older Japanese gentleman performing his ‘calisthenics’ outside. This consists of him wildly throwing his arms forwards and backwards hundreds of times. I perch 10 feet to his right and observe out of the corner of my eye as he continues this routine for quite some time, smiling to myself. What a great way to start the day!

     This retreat was definitely one of the most challenging things I’ve done in my life, but also one of the most rewarding. We were to be completely silent for 10 days. This means no talking, no eye contact, no physical contact, or gestures to any of the other students. You are to act as if you are working alone. By the afternoon of my first day, I started to feel almost trapped inside my own body. “I can’t talk for 10 days? What was I thinking? I don’t know if I can do this?!” Those thoughts only lasted for about an hour, and once I got past that phase, the silence was actually very peaceful and enjoyable.

     It’s amazing how much more aware you become just from being silent. All of your senses become much more amplified. I would notice the slightly salty smell of the forest in the morning, and then a sweetness that would sweep through during midday. Incredible! I would play games with my heightened alertness. One of my favorites was to guess who was sitting behind me during the tea break based solely on the sound of them sipping their tea, and the subtle shuffles they would make in their seat. I’d see how close I could get to a squirrel in the woods before it would notice my presence. My record was 3 feet.

     We meditated 11 hours a day, everyday, with some breaks in between for meals and tea. The meals were all vegetarian, but incredibly delicious. We would eat breakfast at 6:30 and lunch at 11:00 with no evening meal; only tea at 5:00 with a light snack that usually consisted of an apple or a banana. Seeing as how we weren’t doing anything physically draining, my body didn’t have any issues with missing an evening meal.

     The real challenge of the 10 day course was the mental and physical pain that comes along with sitting still for long hours with no back support. The way the course progressed; we learned a few different types of meditation. We started with a technique known as Anapana, which is essentially just focusing on your breath. Any time that you catch your mind wandering off, you bring your attention back to your natural breath, and observe it. Am I breathing more through the right nostril, or the left, or both simultaneously? Is my breath shallow or deep? How does it feel going into my nose?

     The first thing I realized was just how incredibly difficult it is to keep your attention on the breath. Our minds are uncontrollably moving from one thought to the next in such a rapid fashion. The teacher compared what we were doing to training a wild elephant. Patiently and persistently, we kept training our minds to come back to the present moment instead of living in the future or in the past.
I eventually was able to hold my attention for longer and longer periods. By the third day, we were only concentrating on the area below the nostrils and above the upper lip. (I called this Hitler mustache day). I remember following a bead of sweat as it went from the tip of nose, crawled its way around the lip of my left nostril and to the mid part of my nose, and then dripped down to the top of my upper lip. I kept my focus on that bead of perspiration for 20 minutes.

      The physical pain was incredible at this point of the course. My back was aching, my legs were incredibly tense and full of pain. It was so bad, that by the time I went to bed on the third day I was about ready to break. “This pain is only going to keep getting worse and worse, and it’s only day 3! This is probably one of the dumber ideas I’ve ever had.”

     Thankfully, I continued on and made it to day 4 where we learned the main technique of meditation that we came there to learn, Vipassana. With Vipassana meditation, you scan your entire body from top to bottom and simply observe the sensations that you feel in each part without reacting negatively or positively. (Tingling, vibrations, heat, cool, tension, pressure, pulsing, throbbing, itchiness, dryness, perspiration etc.) Whatever sensations you felt, you were to simply observe them objectively for about a minute, and then keep your attention moving onto the next part of the body.

     The whole point of this type of meditation is to teach you to deal with reality as it is. I learned how to look at the pain I was experiencing in my body without associating any mental attachments to it. Instead of thinking, “Oh this hurts so bad! How long is this going to last? I wish this would go away!” I simply observed my pain on an objective level. What does it feel like? Is it a pulsing, or tension, or throbbing? Where does it start? How far up my back does it go? It was almost as if I was a doctor examining the pain on my body. Amazingly, by applying this technique, I started to see my pain slowly dissolve.

     This taught me so much about how we create unnecessary misery in our lives. Whenever something comes along in life that we don’t like, we always make it worse by attaching so much mental pain to it. As soon as we stop doing that, the negative things in our lives can start to heal much faster and begin to pass away. They no longer are given strength through our attachment to them.

     I’ve been a worrier for a long part of my life. During the course, I would catch myself worrying about different things from time to time. Normally, I would let this worry consume me and sometimes ruin entire days or even weeks. During the retreat, I was able to catch myself worrying, and instead of identifying with the worrying just examine it objectively. “How does my body feel right now? Is this something that I have the power to change right now? If not, there is no reason to give it any attention. Let’s see how long this worried feeling lasts.” I would just sit with my worry and observe it as a therapist would observe a patient. The worrying and negative feelings would also start to get weaker and weaker, and then pass soon after. Amazing! 

     I never realized how much unnecessary pain I have been causing myself. I always understood on an intellectual level that worrying doesn’t do you any good, but now I was actually learning how to cope with these feelings. I understood that thoughts and feelings are only temporary things that arise and pass away. If you don’t let them overwhelm you and consume your mind, they’ll pass much sooner than they would have otherwise.
     
     As the course progresses, your attention becomes sharper and sharper. You’re able to focus on increasingly subtle sensations throughout the body. As you do this, things from deeper parts of your mind start to come to the surface. Possibly things that you haven’t dealt with in quite a while, and may not necessarily be pleasant to look at. Feelings of guilt, sadness, fears, etc. I had my fair share of dealing with these emotions.

     The most extreme was on the 5th day. We were about 10 minutes into a group meditation when all of a sudden some really deep-rooted fears sprang to the front of my mind. Fears about death. My whole body came to life in an extreme fashion. It almost felt like every cell was charged with an electric current. Panic consumed me, and my breathing started to intensify and pick up pace. Luckily, I remembered what I had learned so far and tried to look at my fear objectively. I knew that this too was a feeling that would arise and eventually pass away. So I sat with it, and was able to slowly bring myself back down and feel the fear become feebler and feebler. This was a huge moment! Not to say that I completely conquered the fear of death, but I was able to work through some very intense feelings and afterwards felt so great. It was as if I had been relieved of a huge burden.

     The course progressed and I continued to get stronger in my meditation practice. Sitting for an hour without changing posture became relatively easy and pain free. I dealt with smaller issues along the way and was glad I was taking the time to work on myself.
On the final day after our last group meditation, we learned a new technique. They called it Metta meditation. It was a meditation on ‘loving-kindness’ and compassion. We only did this meditation for about 10-15 minutes, but this one really got me. I began to swell up with love, and started to realize all of the love that I have in my life. My thoughts went to my amazing family and incredible friends who actually care about me and support me. I felt so much love, and had so much compassion for everyone and everything in my life. The next thing I knew, tears were streaming down my face and I wept. I just let that feeling wash over me and I cried for almost the entire meditation. It felt so good to just let go. It was a perfect way to end everything.

     Afterwards we were allowed to break our silence, and I spent the rest of the day getting to know the other meditators and learning about their experiences.
     
     This program provided an amazing opportunity for me to work on myself, and make meaningful changes in my life. It helped me break free from unhealthy habit patterns of the mind that were causing me unnecessary pain and misery, some of which I never even realized I was doing. If you can get 10 days free, I’d highly recommend this program to anyone.

     If you have any other questions about the experience, feel free to ask. You can send this to anyone else who you think might want to read it."	t5_2qnc9	True

This is a big deal for me because I had given up on meditation almost a year ago after many frustrating attempts to meditate. And I say ""attempts"" because I never reached the deep meditation level (where your eyes start moving rapidly).  The problem is, I ONCE did attain this level...and from that point on....I don't know if it was because of the excitement (probably was) or what, but for the life of me I could not reach that state again.  So I just decided to give it up and save the frustration.

Well a year later and with a mind more open than last, I realized that your personal meditation is whatever it is...whether it's deep or light, it is beautiful either way.  And this time I decided I was going to avoid having any expectations for it at all, and to just accept what it is.  Also, I used to directly go into using a mantra such as ""One"" or ""Let go"", but this time choose to just use my breath as one.  I would consciously focus on each breath ""Breathing in"" and ""Breathing out"".  

I was so happy because I was appreciating each breath and even started savoring the breath which subconsciously slowed down my breathing to what seemed like the longest breaths I have ever taken in my life!

And that is a big deal for me because I have been so emotionally numb for these past two years (ever since quitting this medication for opiate addiction called suboxone...horrible med btw).  It has been hard for me to find wonder and joy in anything like I used to.  

However I'm sure like anything, practice is necessary for transcendent meditation...and probably that one time I did get into that deep state, I just got very lucky!

But it doesn't matter if I get to that state anytime soon, all that mattered was I appreciated those breaths.  Not for life, but for what they were....the icy cold mass of air as it rushed in through the cave of my mouth and breezed against the walls of my throat, in the slowest motion possible.

So I ask all of you, did it take a while for you to appreciate meditation?  Also, what is your method?  "	t5_2qnc9	True

The pain is so intense right now that I want to scream.

Are there any killer online resources for relaxing spa-like music? Good calm instrumental music has been oddly difficult to find. Any good guided meditation for free or for cheap online? Ways to sit or lay comfortably would be wonderful as well. :) and anything you'd like to tell me!!!"	t5_2qnc9	True

My doctors have prescribed me a variety of meds, including painkillers, to deal with this. They work to some extent, but my pain is still quite excruciating sometimes.

I've been a meditator for about a year now, and I'd like to use my Vipassana practice as a way of observing this pain. I want to stress that I'm not looking for a way to just make it go away, since that's what medicine is for. I just want to be able to better understand the sensations that make it up and learn from it. Not to sound too corny, but I want to be intimate with the pain, and understand my own suffering. 

I'm looking for good article or book recommendations. I've found several articles about dealing with pain, but most of them focus on theory/role of meditation in medicine rather than practical meditation advice.

I haven't meditated properly for about 2 weeks now, until tonight. I was feeling pretty down and bored with things so I decided to try meditating again. I've had formal training at a Buddhist temple and I still visit quite often, really awesome place to meditate plus the food's great.

For the first set of pathetic breath counts my mind was racing with erratic thoughts, it was difficult to count to 4 without having to reset, then another flourish of stupid thoughts crying for attention like little brat kids. Then like the flick of a switch, I managed to say to myself in one small mindful whisper 'focus now', it was really strange, it was like a new language was learnt right there in that moment. And I got it, the moment was missing. Who I am physically and spiritually right then in this instance of now.

From then on I focused hard onto a inhale (I wasn't even keeping count at this point), I carefully opened my mouth and began toe experience what felt like a turbine vacuum under my abs starting.  The air just flowed it naturally, like I didn't even have to flinch.  I imagined it as an invisible cloud of life entering my body. I would then feel it's presence sitting in me as the cloud then seeps into myself. I then exhaled really slowly and visualised it exit from my abdomen, up my body and out my mouth, then into nothing. 

After that first cycle of a breath I was blown away. My whole body felt like a big bag of dry cement. It was like I detuned my body and my mind was one again or something. The feeling remind me of a time I was on tripping on some psilocybins and I felt like I had eyes around every corner but standing still feeling very full, if that makes sense.

Anyways sorry for the mass text but I just felt like sharing this experience with some cool people. It may seem like a small step to some but for me it such an amazing experience.

I've had chronic anxiety for my entire life.  It manifests as feelings in both my head and arms.  I've been meditating for about a year now, hoping that the effects of meditating will help.  I have tried a few methods of meditation but have been doing Vipassana or the last 6 months now.  When I sit to meditate I feel the anxiety fairly strong.  I sit and focus on my breath and, after about 10 minutes I am well into it, paying attention to the feeling of my breath.  What I notice is that I still feel the anxious, continually anxious.  I'm feeling my breath, but feeling my anxious feelings 'behind the scenes'.

Just a few days ago I've started following a mindfulness program on my iPhone, and so far I'm enjoying it thoroughly. I also wanted to take up some more meditation just throughout my day - but I'm a little reluctant. 

In a way, I'm almost afraid of becoming more aware of who I am and my consciousness - and from some of the things I've read here, it seems like it'd be drastically changing how I perceive the world. I'm also afraid of the bad things that might come up. Plus, as dumb as it may sound, I have reservations about dedication and committing myself to something that might not be ""normal"". Every time I start to read up on meditation and awareness and everything I get mental images of becoming some crazy ""enlightened"" being who spends all of his time working with rural villagers in a South Asian temple somewhere and living like the monks of old - for some reason this scares me a little and makes me not want to pursue it.

What does /r/meditation have to say about this? Has anyone been in a similar situation? Right now with my mindfulness program I'm taking baby steps, and can see that it's been helpful with calming my mind, but going further seems to be asking a lot of me :/ Is it possible to keep up a slow pace of meditation without trying to achieve enlightenment?

I have been able to handle myself much better in stressful situations and thrive in the face of adversity, instead of lose my cool.
Just now, however, I had a very stressful moment at work, on top of a very emotional draining day (waiting to hear from the vet if we need to put my cat down). So needless to say, today has not been my greatest day of the week. I didn't freak out though, which was good. But I do feel very overwhelmed.

1329072672.0	pmahj	Sensory Deprivation Tank Experience (Floating)	SailorKingCobra	32	1	23	"I have been practising insight/vipassana meditation for some time now, and this morning, for the first time, I decided to try a sensory deprivation tank.  I thought it would be an interesting way to experience meditation.  In short, it was interesting, but not altogether that much different than sitting.  So if you have the money to try it, you might find it worthwhile, but I do not think it is necessary or made a significant enough difference to make it a ""must-do.""  

At the float spa I went to, the process went like this.  First, I changed into a robe.  Then, they had me go to a waiting room with about ten massage chairs facing a waterfall wall, with light music in the background.  They asked me to sit through a 15 minute chair cycle before going into the float room.  Fine by me.  I normally don't enjoy massage chairs all that much but this one was really quite impressive.  I don't think that a machine will be able to do as good a job as a human in the near future, but this chair was definitely miles above the standard Brookstone mall-type chair.  After 15 minutes, the chair stopped, and I was ready to go to the float room.


The float chamber was attached to a shower, and as instructed, I placed earplugs in before entering the shower.  I washed down, and by the time I was done, the motion-sensor light in the room had turned off, leaving only a soft light in the shower and in the float chamber.  In the float chamber, I pressed the button to turn the lights completely off.  I suppose some people leave them on, but where's the fun in that?


I proceeded to engage my normal meditation practice, focusing on my breathing.  No question--when you're in a float chamber, it's just you and your breathing.  The isolation was profound in its own way.  It was pitch black.  Eyes open, closed, didn't matter... saw the same thing (nothing but some random abstract brain feedback).  The only sound I could hear was my breathing, amplified partially by the earplugs.  One slight annoyance was that I kept drifting into the corners of the tank.  I'd be ""in the zone,"" and then feel my fingers, elbow, toes, whatever, brush up against the edge.  I'd gently push myself way and try not to let it disturb me, but it was definitely a distraction made stronger by the otherwise complete sensory deprivation.  My meditation went fine.  No huge breakthrough, but not a bad sit either.  Some people talk about hallucinating in sensory deprivation tanks... I did not.  I did see some visual effects, but nothing really different than sitting normally.  That in and of itself was somewhat interesting--I had always wondered whether closed-eye visuals while meditating were the result of light filtering through my eyelids and my eye vessels... Still could be, but there was nothing but pitch darkness in the chamber and I still saw abstract lines and such... 

Anxiety... Generally none, although I did have about a 30 second bout of anxiety that I couldn't explain as attached to anything specifically.  I just casually observed the feeling and it went away quickly enough.  I did not find the chamber claustrophobic or anything other than a safe space.

After the session ended, I got an epic chair massage from the masseuse there, who did a fantastic job.  That might have been the highlight of the experience.  Overall something interesting to try, but like I said at the beginning, if you're doing just fine with normal sitting, you're not missing out on anything that special.  Just an interesting chance to try something a bit different.

EDIT: In response to questions below, the actual float itself was 1 hour and cost $80.  This hour did not count changing time, the 15 minute chair massage, etc., so all in all I had a 90 minute appointment.  The chair massage cost $50 for 30 mins which is a bit steep but damn was that ever worth it.  "	t5_2qnc9	True

I felt larger than -everything-, the sensations in my body were just faint images and pure, complete joy engulfed everything I was. I wasn't meditating well, because I was completely absorbed in it and my breathing was a very, very distant thought. But somehow it felt complete.

About 9 months ago, as a result of overuse of MDMA, I developed some pretty bad anxiety and depersonalization/derealization. Since then it's levelled off to the point where I can function in the day-to-day world, but it's still lingering over me constantly. Along with diet+exercise and quitting smoking(cigarettes), i've been meditating for the last couple of weeks(about 30-60 minutes a day) to try and get rid of it. 
A lot of the stuff I've been reading has been advocating completely stopping all pot/booze. I currently drink maybe every 1-2 weeks, only at social events and smoke the odd joint on occasion(if offered).

I've been meditating for awhile.  Started some way back in my teen years but never really took it seriously.  Got into mindfulness meditation a few years back and have done that fairly regularly since.  In the last months or so I've changed focus and started to do mantra meditation.  I guess it's influenced by TM, but I've never paid for a TM course.  I'm just using a mantra.  

At any rate, one day a few weeks ago I was meditating.  I was repeating my mantra with each breath I took.  My breaths were long and deep, and I was really stretching the mantra out; the first syllable with the in breath and second syllable with the out breath.  

At some point in my meditation, I began to have a very intensely visual  experience.  I was standing on a hilltop at a house I used to visit frequently when I was a child (it was my great aunt's house).  With each in breath and each utterance of the first syllable of my mantra, the sky would fill with clouds.  With each out breath and utterance of the second syllable of the mantra, the clouds would retreat and the sun would blossom forth.  When the sun swept over I could feel the garden growing in full land lush and ripe and then dying and wilting when the world darkened and the clouds moved in.  

This went on for a long time.  It felt like years really were passing, like everything in my vision was sped up.  It felt like my breathing was controlling the ebb and flow of the storm clouds.  I tried not to focus on it or to interfere . . . just to let it happen.  

I've never felt such a strong connection to the concept of yin/yang or light/dark.  I mean I could just feel it.  It was not a thought or an idea you read in a book.  It was a feeling.  I could feel that everything is in connection with an opposite.  I could feel my mantra become a circular entity and that my in breath was one half and my out breath was the other.    

I've never had anything like this before or since.  In fact for a time after this, my meditations became difficult.  It was hard for me to focus because I was having a hard time not expecting something like this to happen again.  

I guess I just want to know if any of you know what the hell I'm talking about.

tl;dr I had an intense vision while meditating."	t5_2qnc9	True

How can one just let thoughts or feelings pass by without inner talk going on?  This has always been the core of my problem...I tend to live in the past and worry about the future.  When I think about my past it tends to lead me to hating on myself.  That inner talk that says negative things that makes you want to give up comes out and then messes with my current mood.

I just flat out said today that I want to be happy.  After I got off work I went out for the first time in my life (24) and got Mother's Day gifts for my baby momma and my own mother.  

So how exactly did I get to this meditation session?  I went from /r/getmotivated to /r/getdisciplined for discussion which lead me to ask myself who do I want to be in X years from now.  I decided that I wanted to be a better man and to be content or ""at peace"" within myself along with my physical body and my security (a job/education).  This was all sparked from the rut I've been in since a recent breakup with my baby momma within the last month.

Found a post in /r/getdisciplined that talked about how to better yourself with free time and meditation came up and I found a link to here.  After brushing up on the FAQ and reading Chapter 5+ on Mindfulness in Plain English I decided to sit down and meditate.  Common problems came up, my foot had too much pressure on it, my back had a small place under the shoulder blade that just ached from work.  I kept going back to focus though 1,2,3,4,5, breath in 6,7,8,9,10 breath out and repeat til I focused on the rims of my nose taking in and breathing out air.  After a bit I lost track of time and it turned into a 30 minute session, and I felt relaxed all over.  

Came back to my computer chair where I had League of Legends LCS on and I felt tears come to my eyes from nowhere.  Overwhelming emotion.  The stream was muted, but I was so focused on the casters faces and expressions.  I wasn't hearing what they were saying, but I just could finally start thinking about other people in a different way...through their expressions I could see happiness, anxiousness, sadness.  The players looked so intense, focused and nervous.

I've been meditating every day (Vipassana) for two months now, having started meditating for the first time in November. Overall my practice is going very well, and I'm glad it feels like meditation is a part of my daily life now. 

However, I'm running into some issues, and I'm wondering if more experienced meditators can help me with them.

1. I've gotten decent at clearing my mind of stray thoughts, but very often I just get derailed by **wandering thoughts**. I'll start thinking of something and my mind wanders off for a long while. I end up catching myself, acknowledging the thought, then returning to my breathing, but I resent that wandering off of my thoughts and I wish there was a way to prevent it. Any suggestions? (Or do I just take it for what it is and story worrying about it?)

2. How do you suggest I deal with **falling asleep** during meditation? I tend to nod off and sleep a few seconds at a time. I'm wondering if there's something I can do to prevent it. When sleep comes, I lose mindfulness and my mind starts to dream. By the way, I sit Burmese style, but it doesn't prevent me from sleeping in very short bursts.

3. Finally, I've noticed that since I've started meditating, I spend a lot more time being aware of my **emotional reactions**, but I can't say I feel they control me any less. I still get angry from time to time, for instance, and all I seem to be able to do is observe my anger. It doesn't feel diminished at all. This causes me a little bit of distress, because I feel I'm just more aware of how my emotions rule me every day.

1357073696.0	15sbbe	Isn't that kind of a contradiction?  	PoLops	38	8	30	"Hey all, 

I'm a beginner to this whole meditation thing. While reading chapter 5 of *Mindfulness in Plain English*, I came across two bits of advice that, to me, seem to contradict with one another.

The first bit : 


**""What To Do When the Mind Wanders Away?**

In spite of your concerted effort to keep the mind on your breathing, the mind may wander away. It may go to past experiences and suddenly you may find yourself remembering places you've visited, people you met, friends not seen for a long time, a book you read long ago, the taste of food you ate yesterday, and so on. As soon as you notice that you mind is no longer on your breath, mindfully bring it back to it and anchor it there. However, in a few moments you may be caught up again thinking how to pay your bills, to make a telephone call to you friend, write a letter to someone, do your laundry, buy your groceries, go to a party, plan your next vacation, and so forth. As soon as you notice that your mind is not on your subject, bring it back mindfully. Following are some suggestions to help you gain the concentration necessary for the practice of mindfulness.""

The second bit :

""Also, the mind does not stay all the time with the feeling of breath. It goes to sounds, memories, emotions, perceptions, consciousness and mental formations as well. When we experience these states, **we should forget about the feeling of breath and immediately focus our attention on these states--one at a time, not all of them at one time**. As they fade away, we let our mind return to the breath which is the home base the mind can return to from quick or long journey to various states of mind and body. We must remember that all these mental journeys are made within the mind itself.""

What am I not grasping? Hoping someone can clear this little issue up for me.

I found a useful tool to help me to not be carried away from these impulses is to simply relax and realize that the impulse will soon pass.  This is the ""work"" of meditation and also in training my focus outside. I tend to get easily distracted in day to day life; one impulse is chased by another and this tool has helped me to train myself to focus but also realize that it occurring.

Starting again this morning after a hiatus of over 4 years, I sat quietly and focussed on my breathing, imagining a white light entering my body when inhaling and exhaling darkness (the negative energy). Something I read when I first started all those years ago.

Unlike when I started, I found myself much able to settle into a meditative state, and just let my thoughts drift in and fall out of my mind's eye.

During the course of meditating, I encountered the image of a sunrise. The sunrise then became a ball of light. Like the sun, but not quite. The ball of light just seemed to exist. It didn't feel like a regular thought. It wasn't something that I could just let fall away. I just observed it for what seemed like a long time. It was very bright, but I could start right into it.

It was at this stage I felt a kind of warmth go through my body and I broke out into goose bumps. Like it was cleansing all the negativity I have inside. For the first time in a long while, I felt a sense of complete peace. Just for that moment.

Unusually, the encounter with the light also pushed me out of my meditative state. I can't describe it, but I suddenly felt very ""awake"" and quite energetic. Not sure if my brain had enough for the day but I just couldn't get back to where I was before the encounter, so I stopped.

1299199289.0	fwxl2	Here's how I see it	woodrail	39	6	13	"I came to meditation from art. The first thing I did was try to get a real personal grip on it, like I might an artistic medium - to get the reality and throw away the ritual. What you see here is mainly a product of my own investigations. I may be missing something that a formal tradition may have to offer, but what I have I feel good about. 

So here's how I see it :

It's all about awareness.

We are all already somewhat familiar with awareness. For example, we all know how to ""focus our attention"". That's concentrating our awareness. We are also all familiar with ""getting distracted"" too - getting your awareness yanked around by distracting stuff. Awareness is something that we deal with all the time.

Awareness is dynamic and amorphous. It moves like a liquid, a blob, a finger, a cloud of gas, a laser... It focuses, spreads out, assumes various shapes... In the uncultivated it is that ""drunken monkey"" ... constantly jumping here and there, restless, controlled by a hundred habits, reactionary and agitated. In the cultivated it is more controlled, peaceful and coherent.

(I think that awareness is our fundamental nature or fundamental ""self"". Call it ""awareness"" or ""awareness body"" ... ""soul"" or ""witness"" even. Or ""That which perceives"")

OK, now MEDITATION simply takes this subject of ""awareness"" further.

*Meditation*

When we meditate we're flexing this ""awareness"" in a formal, simplified way.
We have 2 basic meditationy actions : CONCENTRATION and EXPANSION.

(Yes, I'm sort of making up terms here. I don't like alot of the traditional terms I see. Lots of ambiguity and sloppiness... so I'm just gonna make up my terms here. I think that the ones I've picked are pretty good and descriptive. Bear with me.)

In CONCENTRATION we choose an object and upon that object we focus our awareness for a length of time as perfectly as we are able. This brings stillness. The monkey chills out. We also gain clear and penetrating vision, magnified willpower, the fog of our reactions clears and we see new stuff. Bullshit melts before our laserlike gaze. We may become insufferable to our friends... and other stuff. We also gain a valuable education and new insight into the action of this awareness body.

In EXPANSION we abide, chill, in stillness (arrived at via CONCENTRATION, perhaps). We do not flit around like the monkey, and neither do we root ourselves upon an ""object of concentration"" - rather we refrain from ALL such flitting/focussing/attaching behavior - we just chill profoundly and reside nowhere. in this state our awareness moves in a NEW WAY : it EXPANDS, like an inflating balloon. It expands in ways that we are familiar with and a thousand new ways too. We grow from a chunk of stone into an expanding cloud. We get high, Our love expands. We see MUCH NEW STUFF, the invisible becomes visible. Our power grows. Our love grows. We gain access to the reality of infinite love and beauty.... and lots of other good stuff. It's great.

CONCENTRATION is excellent prep for EXPANSION. I use it that way alot. A lot of other people use this concentration-then-expansion approach too. It is ancient and popular.

---

*More or less equivalent terms in various traditions*

CONCENTRATION : ""samatha"" (buddhism) : samprajnata dyhana (aka ""meditation with a seed"") (raja yoga). I think the taoists just call it ""concentration"".

EXPANSION : ""vipassana"" (buddhism. Tho I hear that some people do a vipassana-in-stages thing which I am not familiar with""). asamprajnata dhyana (aka ""meditation without a seed"") (raja yoga). ""choiceless awareness"" (osho). ""formless meditation"" (ram dass). I think the taoists just call it ""meditation"".

---

*Concentration tricks*

In my experience the ""stillness"" effect is achieved no matter what ""object"" you concentrate on - HOWEVER different ""side effects"" or ""insights"" can be achieved by doing CONCENTRATION on different objects. People use breath, mantra (repeated word), visualization of sacred stuff, a candle flame, an idea, a sound ... anything really. You can also concentrate on ""channels of perception"" - that is, the whole of whatever is coming to you via one of your senses - sight, sound, taste, thought ... There's alot to explore there.

One BIG AMAZING trick for me is :  #1 chill out with concentration (I like to use the sensation of breath in my nose tip) #2 concentrate on my thought stream... follow the stream to it's source ......... mind==blown

1374955977.0	1j6dnd	I have been meditating for six months and I don't feel any different.	OMGCanIBlowYou	34	7	33	"What am I doing wrong? I have tried different techniques over the years, but mainly focused on emptying my mind / focusing on my breath. For many years, I would really ""work"" during meditation, and successfully clear my mind for several minutes at a time, but it was exhausting and stressful, which seemed wrong.

I've taken a different approach these past few months, and while still focusing on my breath, been much more relaxed about letting my mind wander and bringing it back to my breath.

The thing is, after all these months, I haven't noticed any difference. I don't feel like I'm more centered, or have more self-control, or can handle difficult emotions... I probably would have stopped, but I do like the meditation as a break between breakfast and the rest of my day.

I've tried different time amounts - 5 minutes, 10, 15, and 20, once daily. I've been doing 20 for some time, and I find myself almost never focused on my breath - I will think about something for several minutes before remembering to go back to my breath, and my mind wanders again almost immediately, again for several minutes. I wanted to be more relaxed about my practice, but this approach doesn't seem very effective either. I know my mind will wander, but it often seems like I am simply thinking of something else, with very brief ""focus on breath"" interruptions.

I recently realized that I have a lot of trouble experiencing sadness, and thought that was perhaps part of the problem - my technique is about being ""empty"" and perhaps I actually need some dwelling? I've tried some ""brooding"" as an alternative to meditation (letting very negative thoughts run wild for 15 minutes, and then moving on), and I feel that's helpful when I am feeling sad. But what if I'm not sad? Should I still brood? 

Any thoughts or advice is appreciated. I will be honest, I am mainly meditating because it's supposed to be helpful for self-discipline, and maybe this isn't the right mindset... I don't know. Thanks!"	t5_2qnc9	True

Has anyone else experienced this?	unicornmullet	36	10	24	"I started meditating regularly fairly recently and I'm starting to be able to look at my thoughts objectively. I find myself commenting on thoughts as they float through my brain (eg, ""Oh, here's my social anxiety kicking in"" or, ""Here's me projecting my insecurity onto my friend."") From what I understand, it is a good sign?

It feels as though my self-coping cognitions (my tendency to invest in the future, fantasize about how great my future will be instead of being in the moment, etc) have diminished, and I'm seeing my mind and my behaviors more clearly. I find myself seeing how petty I can be, how I project my emotions onto other people, how negative my mind can be, etc. As a result, my emotions have been filled with self-loathing. I realize I need to get past these self-judgments and learn to love myself as means of stopping the unproductive thoughts / behaviors, and I'm sure I will get there eventually.

1371458715.0	1gi7po	My anxiety.	mcswanNZ	38	6	17	"If I want to a psychiatrist they'd probably tell me I have pretty severe, persistent anxiety. I already know that. I'm neurotic as hell.

I've always been trying to think my way out of my trap, but I've realised in some of my latest sits that it is actually my thinking in the first place that is my trap. In yesterdays meditation I woke and sat for almost an hour and reached a state of no-thought while sitting outside and observing the life around me.

I felt completely worry-free, happy and relaxed. I watched the physical sensations that my anxiety has been giving me for months now and they dissipated as well. I watched some of my thoughts and I quickly discovered that beneath the anxiety there is nothing really holding it up but the anxiety itself. So the last couple of days, whenever I see it creeping up, I simply subject it to my awareness and it goes away because I know it is just an illusion.

I've felt more socially easy and open to people. I'm not worried about eye contact or body language and I'm less neurotically conscious of my emotions and myself in social situations than I was.

However, I believe persistence is key so I'm about to begin my second sit for today and make sure I keep it up. I've had some results with meditation in the past but I find if I do not to it regularly my mind degenerates back into its old traps within time. I will no longer let that happen."	t5_2qnc9	True
1370703199.0	1fxeqi	What is meditation really? (long)	Moxxface	40	8	12	"Demand is born out of duality: ""I am unhappy and I must be happy"". In that very demand that I must be happy is unhappiness. When one makes an effort to be good, in that very goodness is evil. Everything affirmed contains its own opposite, and effort to overcome strengthens that against which it strives. When you demand an experience of truth or reality, that very demand is born out of your discontent with what is, and therefore the demand creates the opposite. And in the opposite there is what has been. So one must be free of this incessant demand, otherwise there will be no end to the corridor of duality. This means knowing yourself so completely that the mind is no longer seeking.

Such a mind does not demand experience; it cannot ask for a challenge or know a challenge; it does not say, ""I am asleep"" or ""I am awake"". It is completely what it is. Only the frustrated, narrow, shallow mind, the conditioned mind is always seeking them more. Is it possible then to live in this world without the more - without this everlasting comparison? Surely it is? But one has to find out for oneself.

Investigation into this whole question is meditation. That word has been used both in the east and the west in a most unfortunate way. There are different schools of meditation, different methods and systems. There are systems which say, ""Watch the movement of your big toe, watch it, watch it, watch it""; there are other systems which advocate sitting in a certain posture, breathing regularly or practicing awareness. All this is utterly mechanical. Another method gives you a certain word and tells you that if you go on repeating you will have some extraordinary transcendental experience. This is sheer nonsense.

It is a form of self-hypnosis. By repeating Amen or Om or Coca-Cola indefinitely you will obviously have a certain experience because by repetition the mind becomes quiet. By repetition you can induce the mind to be gentle and soft but it is still a petty, shoddy, little mind. You might as well put a piece of stick you have picked up in the garden on the mantelpiece and give it a flower every day. In a month you will be worshiping it, and not to put a flower in front of it will become a sin.

Meditation is now following any system; it is not constant repetition and imitation. Meditation is not concentration. It is one of the favorite gambits of some teachers of meditation to insist on their pupils learning concentration - that is, fixing the mind on one thought and driving out all other thoughts. This is a most stupid, ugly thing, which any schoolboy can do because he is forces to. It means that all the time you are having a battle between the insistence that you must concentrate on the one hand and your mind on the other which wanders away to all sorts of other things, whereas you should be attentive to every movement of the mind wherever it wanders. When your mind wanders off it means you are interested in something else.

Meditation demands an astonishingly alert mind; meditation is the understanding of the totality of life in which every form of fragmentation has ceased. Meditation is not control of thought, for when thought is controlled it breeds conflict in the mind, but when you understand the structure and origin of thought, then thought will not interfere. That very understanding of the structure of the thinking is its own discipline which is meditation.

Meditation is to be aware of every thought and of every feeling, never to say it is right or wrong but just to watch it and move with it. In that watching you begin to understand the whole movement of thought and feeling. And out of this awareness comes silence. Silence put together by thought is stagnation, is dead, but the silence that comes when thought has understood its own beginning, the nature of itself, understood how all thought is never free but always old - this silence is meditation in which the meditator is entirely absent, for the mind has emptied itself of the past.

Meditation is a state of mind which looks at everything with complete attention, not just parts of it. And no one can teach you how to be attentive. If any system teaches you how to be attentive, then you are attentive to the system and that is not attention. Meditation is one of the greatest arts in life - perhaps the greatest, and one cannot possibly learn it from anybody, that is the beauty of it. It has no technique and therefore no authority. When you learn about yourself, watch yourself, watch the way you walk, how you eat, what you say, the gossip, the hate, the jealousy - if you are aware of all that in yourself, without any choice, that is part of meditation.

So meditation can take place when you are sitting in a bus or walking in the woods full of light and shadows, listening to the singing of birds or looking at the face of your wife or child. In the understanding of meditation there is love, and love is not the product of systems, of habits, of following a method. Love cannot be cultivated by thought. Love can perhaps come into being when there is complete silence, a silence in which the meditator is entirely absent; and the mind can be silent only when it understands its own movement as thought and feeling. To understand this movement of thought and feeling there can be no condemnation in observing it. To observe in such a way is the discipline, and that kind of discipline is fluid, free, not the discipline of conformity.

I realized that at the core of my sadness and feelings of anxiety in my chest whenever I think about her and the relationship we had (or when I start thinking about her with other guys...) comes from a deep-rooted lack of self-confidence (that I've obtained through out middle school and high school due to my former body size and the fact I liked girls who didn't like me back), and also an immense inability to just calm down and enjoy the present. I let the past haunt me, and create memories of the future that have not and some that most likely will not occur to create anxiety. This is seriously ridiculous and it's ruining the start of my summer. 

Has meditation helped people with this? I've been doing a bit of it the past two days and I've seen some minute results.

They typically say 'it didn't ""work"" for me' as if It's some kind of shortcut for enlightment or something but It's not. I know how painful suffering can be but no one said It would be easy. I can understand why someone can have doubts about it because it's time consuming and takes a lot of energy but meditation is not going to 'cure' you miraculously. You must work hard to train your mind and learn how to make peace with your ego. Even if you still suffer after months of practicing, don't just give up and say things like 'maybe meditation is not for everyone'. Remember, meditation is simply a tool. If you think you have failed then you should reexamine your approach to mindfulness meditation. Find more resources and Try different methods. just don't judge or criticize yourself. The key is to develop a sort of third person's perspective and detach yourself from all negative emotions. They are product of your ego, not you. Once you get used to this idea then you are longer a slave to your ego. You no longer react to your negative emotions impulsively. I still struggle from time to time and not even sure if I'm qualified to give such advice but don't be afraid to look inward and face your problems. If you resist then you will start making up excuses blaming external things such as meditation but as i said, it's merely a tool and its in your hand. Find your own way to use it and eventually you will find your answers.

That being said if you do want to meditate stoned I recommend that either you smoke very little (one soft hit, there's no need to fill your lungs, if you cough you smoked too much) or if you wait until a few hours (5 or 6) after you smoked. The former will relax you and make you introspective, the latter will make your mind extremely quiet.

In any case, one thing that weed and meditation have in common is that everybody seems to have their own reaction to them, and different things work for different people. Try it out. But in my experience weed will only make the voice in your head louder and harder to drown out. "	t5_2qnc9	True

It's the perfect time to be present and meditate!	archaicfrost	37	9	12	"I went to the dentist for the first time in a while for a cleaning and x-rays a few weeks ago, and have since gone back in to get some fillings replaced (and will be going back in another couple weeks).

When I was younger and had to get dental work done I would typically let my mind wander and think about school, some girl, what I was going to eat when I was done, how I hated the feeling of my face being numb, or any number of things. Sometimes this was to try to distract myself of the discomfort of keeping my jaw gaped open, but mostly because I had no concept of being present.

For both appointments I closed my eyes (bright light shining in them isn't very pleasant), acknowledged the discomfort, and tried to focus on the sensations and exactly what the hygienist/doctor was doing. During the cleaning it was easy to follow along since my senses were fully functioning, but even with lidocaine anesthetizing everything I found if I concentrated on the sensations I could follow along and remain present.

The experience was far more pleasant than I had ever experienced in the past (though I still wouldn't say enjoyable) and even though the appointment lasted longer than anticipated the time felt like it passed by relatively quickly.

During my practice I typically focus on the breath, and this experience was very similar. Actually it even seemed easier to remain present because I knew I wasn't going anywhere for at least an hour, and now that I have experience being present and know how to do it, it is easier to remain present than it is to distract yourself and let your mind wander when there are tools and hands inside your mouth."	t5_2qnc9	True

There is no need to sit cross legged or strive for it, even after you ""*really* know how to meditate.""

True deep meditation is a goal that few mention here. But there are a load of conversations about getting into padmasana or other cross legged positions.

Why?
Because we are approaching meditation from the outside, instead of from within. It will never come together that way.

It doesn't matter what you look like or how you sit if you want truth enough. That desire is much more important than anything else.

It's not bad to desire, seek, or long for lasting joy. I wonder if people out there have trouble believing it's even possible. It is.
