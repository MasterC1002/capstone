 ---------

**edit:** because this might seem overly confusing, I am going to start off with a TL;DR, and if you find the rest overwhelming, this is all you really need:

From now on, link titles must follow this format:

Title, date [Cause Tag(s)] 

as in: 

'Uncle Sam Wants You', 1916 [Recruiting]

                  -or-                  

'Uncle Sam Wants You', 1916 [Recruiting, Poster]

                 -or-

'Uncle Sam Wants You', 1916 [Recruiting, Poster, WWI]

* the [Cause] tags can be between one and three of the 120 that are listed in the tables below, which are going to be permanently found in [the wiki.](http://www.reddit.com/r/PropagandaPosters/wiki/submissions)

* Plus they need a link flair added after you post, which you do by clicking the link flair button which is found in the title section of your submission.

Here is what an example would look like after having link flair added to it:

[United States] 'Uncle Sam Wants You', 1916 [Recruiting]

----------------
Now on with the very detailed explanation:

I tried with this yesterday, but it got washed out by better submissions, hopefully this gets attention because otherwise there are going to be a lot of people with removed submissions in the near future.

Welcome to all the new subscribers, and to those that have been here a long time, it's been a long time since we've had one of these and there aren't any major changes in the subreddit, but if you ever submit here please read this.

First off, a bit of history and an explanation on the state of the subreddit.

From the beginning this subreddit has asked that submission titles remain neutral and informative, and that they provide as much information as possible. For a long time this was rarely veered from, sometimes months would go by between requests to follow the guidelines.

However, these guidelines clash with the majority of the rest of reddit where 'mystery' titles, such as 'Found this on facebook' are common, and these types of titles are being used here more frequently, sometimes several times a day and this subreddit is becoming increasingly difficult to moderate effectively.

We have not had an exact set of rules to follow, so often titles have the absolute bare minimum and it is becoming increasingly difficult to remind people this subreddit aims for informative titles, rather than catchy.

We would like this subreddit to remain searchable, and to keep the focus on understanding propaganda, rather than spreading it, so we are going to have a stricter and more standardized set of rules.

We are going to use /u/Deimorz's bot /u/AutoModerator to remove submissions that do not match an exact title format.

This is what it looks like now, although suggestions are welcome:

--------

#Rules for Submissions

##Link Formatting

There will be an example title in the sidebar, and the full rule set will be in the wiki, plus AutoModerator will also post a brief explanation and links in every submission it removes.

Soon we will be able to have a link to sort the subreddit by any of the link flair tags, and within a few months searching by the other tags will also be useful.

Also, we have long asked that links to publicly-funded websites, and blogs, be re-hosted on a reliable image host, and AutoModerator is also going to help enforce this.

Any comments, questions, or recommendations are more than welcome.

If anyone  has thoughts on the subreddit in general, what they would like to see, or ideas they have, then please use this thread as a place to discuss them."	t5_2rm3n	True

On the way, they travel at 92 km/h and on the way back at 54 km/h. If we know that the journey there took three hours, how long will the return journey take?

&gt; On a collective field of 1.37 hectares, the harvest totals 1,294.65 tonnes. Before the liberation, only 219.2 tonnes were harvested on the same area. How many more tonnes have the farmers harvested after the liberation?

&gt; The people's army, after a battle against the armies of the American imperialist dogs and the South Korean puppets, took 15,130 soldiers prisoner. Among them were 1,130 more American bastards than South Korean puppets. How many American dogs and South Korean puppets were there?

&gt; 276 of Kim Il-Sung's soldiers are fighting against 577 Japanese. They kill 431. How many are left, and how many soldiers altogether are left on the battlefield, if we know that the losses among our ranks are three times less?

&gt; Dear Leader Kim Jong-ill is listening to a class in nursery school. The teacher says: 'One apple plus one apple equals two apples.' Dear Leader gets to his feet and protests: 'No, one plus one equals one!' He takes two pieces of plasticine and lumps them together in support of his thesis. He also gives the example of water which, when mixed together, still makes one. The other pupils then recognize the rightness of the Dear Leader's observation, and begin to exclaim, 'He's right, there's no doubt about it!' The teacher is left speechless and the pupils have learned a new thing thanks to Dear Leader Kim Jong-Il: one plus one does not always equals two.
