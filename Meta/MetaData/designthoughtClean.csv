The design of the site itself is pretty cool. Very colorful, vibrant; the images pop nicely and the text is easy to read. But something about the photos struck me as being off.

Compare the product photos of the [iPad](http://www.apple.com/ipad/) to [Surface](http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/) and you will see the difference immediately: Hands. The hands, no doubt from some high-tier hand model, make the device look extremely attractive. The iPad is fairly plain in terms of design, but people holding it makes it look remarkably more *human* and *friendly*. 

The Surface doesn't have any photos of the device in the hands of 'users' and it makes it feel less inviting.

**tl;dr Hands holding a product makes the product look better.**

(PS:  I happen to love the Surface and plan to purchase one upon release).

What are your thoughts? Is the trick to product photos *human hands?*"	t5_2qvgd	True

1362468729.0	19p2iz	User friendly design is unhealthy.	nodefense	38	16	12	"Hi /r/designthought. I'm a self-taught web developer who is trying to find their design stance, and would like to have a conversation about user friendliness. What I want to talk about touches on some philosophical points to do with public and private spaces.

In a nutshell, user-friendly design as a paradigm seems to promote hedonism in the user by being committed to their pleasure as a guiding principle. This is a very normal mindset in strongly capitalist cultures, probably to the point that maximising satisfaction seems like *the* common-sense approach to life for most people. And that would be the end of the story, except that respite from endless comfort is well known to be deeply satisfying - what happens when you ask ""is there more to life"". So I got to wondering if there is another web design paradigm which goes beyond this superficiality.

Put another way, it seems to me that user-friendly design culture fosters a commodifying milieu of communication. As such, it has a natural tendency towards all-consuming private control: the familiar and hated sea of ads, supported by some grotesque parody of communication. In fact I'd say that blogspam is the ultimate nightmare of user friendliness, because it cuts to the heart of what users expect when they visit a website. The object of pleasure, ie content, is made as obscure as possible, users have to jump through hoop after hoop to attain satisfaction, and all the while the site owner is milking ad views and clickthrough for all they are worth. The most user-friendly sites really just enable this kind of exploitation of users by reinforcing user expectations of immediate gratification.

This whole line of thinking started with a video of a Zizek lecture I saw (which I can't find for the life of me now..), and one of his points that stuck with me. To paraphrase, and I might have misremembered it: on the internet there is a problem of private takeover of public communication. So this might be a fruitful launching point from which to rethink web design, ie by foregrounding aspects which are by their nature public. Direct interaction must surely be part of it, eg Kickstarter insofar as it informalises the relationship between makers and consumers. Or for example requiring that users put their reputation on the line in some fashion, when they comment or submit content, would counter the masturbatory attitude you get in anonymous contexts. Maybe some sort of built-in inducement to engaging with challenging content, even unpleasant or offensive content.

Do you think this approach to web design has merit? It already has a long history in the arts - in painting, you already almost expect to be challenged. Please let me know what you think. If there are good examples of this that you know of, if it smells like a load of bullshit to you, if it belongs on another subreddit, etc. Thanks for your time."	t5_2qvgd	True

I just stumbled on this on awwwards and was blown away by the message that this website propagates:

*We are Soldiers, at war with the street. Look at our mighty force, fear us!*

The first thing you see is a face, half hidden behind a military-style shotgun. Two warriors exit their tank to combat the invisible enemy hidden in the white space with unrestrained, lethal force. The colors are toned down, cool and the contrast is very coarse. The Human element is reduced to some skin on the Arms and Head.

Further down on the site you can see the officers, lined up and stiff like they are a battalion of machines, ready to be send to the front lines. In command is an old man, a hardliner, merciless to the enemy.

What is it the police does there? Where is the peaceful, open helper who you seek for support? Why do I instead have to fear and avoid the merciless warrior, armed to the teeth for war? Do I live in a war zone? (This is hypothetical, I do not live in the US.).

I got my BFA in graphic design in 2009 and learned more in my first year out of school than I did while studying. there was almost no cultural discussions beyond the First Things First Manifesto. there was no introduction to contemporary graphic designers, poor context for historical graphic design. the assignments were the same as they were for the previous 15 or 20 years, with almost no thought to new technology. overall it just a _really_ underwhelming experience.

thankfully I found my own path in spite of my college instructors, through online friends and forums, a couple real-life friends, and essays I've stumbled upon here and there. 

I want to say my school was especially bad (for the sake of students everywhere), but I've stepped into a couple highly regarded schools in NYC and can't say there's much of a difference. same ignorance, maybe a little more relevancy due to location, but poor teaching, poor students, etc.

I think things are moving in the right direction; it's easier now than ever to grasp what's happening in graphic design. blogs like Design Observer give a range of essays, hundreds of Tumblrs, or image blogs to research from, etc.

I guess my my starting questions for discussion are:  

1. if you could go back and do it all over again, what kind of things would you demand from your teachers? 

2. if current you were teaching college you, what kind of coursework would you assign? 

3. what should students graduate knowing?"	t5_2qvgd	True

I'm studying computer science and digital art, but recently, at an orientation for a grant that my team is being awarded, a professor was giving a quick lecture on design. It got me more interested in design (and my recent posts to r/web_design should make that apparent). He also stated that a School of Design was planned to be formed at my university, but it never happened.

It's a shame that it didn't. I really want to understand design; it's an important topic especially if you are creating external processes and objects. Whatever I create has to easily correlate with whatever internal processes that go on within all of us. However, design is a very difficult topic to get my mind around. There are so many disciplines popping up within the design community and there are many different principles that don't always relate. A lot of these advices or best practices seem like experience-based guesses that don't really have a fundamental explanation (or if there is, it sure isn't being explained clearly or left unstated). 

In the same way that learning discrete math and computer science made it easy for me to decipher the latest online posts and discussions on programming. I really want to get a clear sense of design, so that I know what designers are talking about of the moment.

I believe this question is best asked in this subreddit, if I'm wrong I can redirect this question.

I've struggled for so long with trying to tackle my own personal branding. I have an androgynous name and one of the most common last names in the book. I've tried the basics - sketching (hundreds of) initials, breaking down the letter-forms, etc. Nonetheless, I can finally say I'm beyond stuck with this. Does anyone have advice or a good read when it comes to branding oneself? 

Thank you so much ahead of time!"	t5_2qvgd	True

1304919026.0	h74iz	Discussion on the Devaluation of Various Design Markets	efas	12	2	2	"Hello everyone I'd like to have an open discussion on if you believe there is devaluation occurring in any particular design market you professionally work in and if you could provide any stories or evidence for why you think that.

I have most of my experience as an in-house designer and developer, so usually I have to wear many hats doing everything from developing marketing campaigns to coding websites. I want to hear from other designers and developers to find out what your opinion is on whether or not your particular niche (freelance, large firms, in-house) has seen, or if you expect to see getting paid less for the same service/product due to factors external or out of your direct control.

The reason I want to find out what everyone thinks about this is that I have recently started to see numerous requests for free design work, job listings that are crazy (people saying ""small job: site redesign""), 
a general misunderstanding of what professional design is, and overall, lower wages/contracts for design and development jobs. 

I'm all about pro bono work, however, I feel that if a whole bunch of people who aren't really professional about their approach will adversely affect the market for those of us that are professionals. An example of this would be people asking for free colorization of old B&amp;W pictures. While this can be done quickly and relatively easily in Photoshop by even unexperienced users to decent effect, does the end result leave the person who requested the work thinking: a) This is really good, looks like how I wanted it to, and I'll recommend/use again this free service, or b) This looks really not how I wanted it to and I bet if the internet can't give me something that looks good, paying someone $50 to do it won't be much different. To me there are two issues here: whether or not the person liked the work, there has been devaluation within the market b/c I provided a service that would normally have given another designer gainful employment, and, are people who do the work in a shoddy manner giving the rest of us a bad reputation (the old ""my friends kid can make your website"" argument) and therefore devaluing professional design services. 

I think that there is a vast amount of misinformation out in the public regarding what designers and developers do, their contributions to multiple business aspects, what is fair compensation based on the work, and what is ""professional"" work vs a hobby. The times that I start to think about this is when I go to a website like, http://www.avpress.com/ then go to view-source:http://www.avpress.com/ and discover that this ""professional"" web design company has simply used copied and pasted JS/JQuery and heavy Dreamweaver ""point-and-click"" code, rather than developing their own JS/DHTML/CSS as I would expect any professional to do. I know that this isn't a major operation with a large budget or anything like that, however, I believe that it does affect and devalue the market for other designers and developers. I think that it really just stinks that people who actually do work hard on design and coding have to compete in the same market as those who slap together a website in a couple days.

I would appreciate it if we kept downvotes to a minimum on all comments since this is all purely opinion, where anecdotal evidence may be more appropriate than hard statistics (e.g. working freelance=lots more stories)."	t5_2qvgd	True

But, it's been about four years since I've interviewed and I thought I might as well put 'me' through the process to iron out any kinks in case I need to do this for real anytime soon.

I have a linkedin profile which has all the usual dates of employment, statement of intent/approach etc.  And I have my portfolio which goes in to depth on how I tackle problems*.  

The issue I came across recently was that the hiring manager, not the recruiter, wanted a resume because ""I want to understand his UX toolbox but I dont have time to go through all the stuff in his portfolio""  and that put my nose right out of joint. That's not someone who I want to work for, anyone can fill their resume full of buzzwords.. hell, that's how I started out.

I've got no problem creating a resume, I might even have some fun creating an interactive one with some css flavours for print/busy hiring manager/recruiter/etc but I'm left wondering.  This is 2011, resumes are BS.  My portfolio is me, it's got what I can do and how I do it.  If you rely on a resume to make decisions then what else is broken in your org.

What do people think? 

tldr; Do orgs that get it still need resumes as well as portfolios?

*When I passed my portfolio through r/design_crits a common complaint was not enough eye candy, not enough what shipped.  I'll stand by my guns; a good portfolio demonstrates thinking.  Saying I worked on website X or product Y means little and that is what is behind my thinking; resumes are BS.doc

I'm a UI designer currently working at a startup with a strong focus on location (we do a lot of things with maps and pins). 

I know I want to re-imagine this whole metaphor, but find myself trapped in the conventional paradigm. Functionally, we still need to convey where a location is on a map; I just don't want to do so with a pin. The new solution must work at different zoom levels (so simply coloring in an area of the map would not suffice). 

I'd really appreciate your insights and questions to get my creativity flowing again. 

Thanks for your help, r/designthought. 


**tl;dr: I'm rethinking the map and pin metaphor. I want to come up with something other than a conventional pin to mark a location on a map, and need your help!**

edit: Thanks for the feedback. I've decided to study the best elements of pins currently out there. I'd appreciate any links you have to pins that you pin particularly beautiful or functional.

I've been there myself and realized how ultimately devaluing and debasing the whole process is to design and the design industry as a whole. I'm here to discuss a conundrum I faced today as a working designer.*

Here's my problem: I've been charged with designing a brand for my company. After the summer rush and the mountains of work I'm currently buried under, my creative edge has been severely impacted and my creative energies are just spent. I haven't had a second to re-charge and I'm desperately seeking some measure of real inspiration.

The company name is My Benefit Advisors. Their standing logo/brand/identity is garbage. It was designed in the late 90's early 00's and pre Web 2.0. The company is re-launching as a company that ""brings big business resources to your small business."" My Benefit Advisors sells and maintains Wholesale General Insurance, which amounts to the benefits package that you get from your job when they say, ""and Benefits"" we sell and maintain that ""Benefits"" part.

So while designing this logo with as little specific direction as humanly possible, I've hit a brick wall, it's been a total massacre...

My boss asked me today how I felt about crowdsourcing the logo for concepts and ideas, and I'm having an incredibly difficult time arguing with him, strictly because I am SO unbelievably stuck on the logo concepts.

Have any of you ever been stuck in this quagmire? If so, how did you manage to get out of it? What would you suggest I do in this circumstance, and no, ""go for the spec work idea"" isn't an option. I really won't devalue myself or anyone else for concepts ... it's cheap.

While pagination sometimes seems like a dated and unnecessarily skeuomorphic approach, it has many benefits:
- It provides spacial organization
- It doesn't require constant interaction with the screen
- It provides a place to 'bookmark'

Scrolling works really well for smaller pieces and feels native to the screen, but the constant interaction and the 'edgeless' feeling it provides with longer pieces can be a problem. It reminds one that a physical scroll is an outdated medium for a reason.

I haven't come to any final conclusions, I just wonder what you have struggled with or more points that I may have missed in the considerations for how we interact with digital content. "	t5_2qvgd	True

I have a three column navigation menu to browse the course listings, and a list that collects the sections they are interested in as they mark them. I can post screenshots later, my I'm on my iPod righ now. 

The current layout has a menu across the bottom of the screen that expands once the user adds a course, and can me minimized after the initial expansion. It works similar to Google's web fonts list. The other layout tried was similar to Facebook's messenger contact list, narrow, and stuck to the side of the screen. nether of these options were very great because the list either covers much of the screen and is mostly white space (first example), or it disrupts the otherwise simetrical layout of the page. In both cases, the list can cover up portions of the column nav, and the user needs to minimize the list if it gets too long. 

Pretty much anything I come up with has the downside of potentially hiding important elements to users with smaller screen, or distrupts the simplistic symmetry of the page (simple being more important than symmetry, but the three columns lends itself to that perfectly). So, I am turning to you, r/designthough, to see what creative solutions we can come up with for placing this list.

Hi everybody. I hope this is the right place to ask and it isn't too lame of a request. 

I'm a dev that usually hangs out in /r/programming and /r/linux and so on. I'm working on a site to support something I've been doing in Seattle for the last year, and I could use some help with design cues.

**Heads up**: I'm not looking for mockups. I'm not looking for free work. I don't want handouts. I like putting things together in GIMP/Inkscape. I'm just not terribly creative, so I just want ideas, thoughts, or cues.

The Urban Block Project is an idea we have that focuses on picking up trash and urban environmentalism. We meet every Sunday in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle and clean things up. We get to know our hood and meet our neighbors when we drink beers after, and we end up scaring off the drug dealers somehow. 

We think this idea can grow, so we are putting our ""lessons learned"" together and putting them up on a site. We also want the educate people as well as connect interested new-comers to existing groups near their home. 

The verbs in the site are ""learn"" (text-heavy education), ""join"" (find groups nearby), and ""connect"" (I guess we want a forum) and I've got decent functionality for all so far. 

I was hoping for a color scheme that would set off the greys and dark colors of the city from the green and vibrancy of the environmental growth we support. So far it looks really boring. 

So that's about as much as I can think to share for now. Do you folks have ideas, words, or imagery that you think would be helpful as I seek to define the look and feel for our idea?

Thanks for any response I get.

For example the [iPad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1st-Gen-iPad-WiFi-iBooks.jpg) and the new [Surface](http://i.imgur.com/1CRWk.jpg), why is there about an inch wide bezel around the whole screen? Is it purely a technological limit and the bezel allows the tablet to be stronger? Why not use gorilla glass to provide support?

Every time I look at a tablet, I get reminded of [old CRT TV's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Television_set_from_the_early_1950s.jpg) when I believe most people would rather have [LED TV](http://www.samsung.com/us/images/article/LED_subtypepage.jpg) styling with virtually edge to edge screens and no bezels.

Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask these questions- hope I'm not breaking any rules by posting my predicament here.  

I've been accepted to two pretty different MFA programs. One is at a top-rated university for studying graphic design (Program 1), and the other is a very prestigious university in the US with a somewhat unknown design program (Program 2).  

It boils down to this: If I go to Program 1, I think I'd learn more as a designer and really develop my skill set and thought processes, and be surrounded by some really talented people. 2-year commitment. However, it's a relatively unknown school outside of the design world, or the east coast for that matter.  

If I go to Program 2, I think I'd grow minimally (as their program appears sort of underdeveloped), but the school is VERY recognized and well-connected, and I'd probably never have to worry about finding a job. 3-year commitment.  

I've fortunately got funding for both so money isn't as big of an issue... But damn it's is a hard choice. Thoughts?

(Or: Instagram is getting a spin-off…)	SimonDrexler	3	1	1	"I still do not get the catch behind Instagram and all those apps trying to get the picture that looks older and shittier of a brand new camera that is being improved over a lot of work. Once my children grow up and I'll be able to show them nothing but pictures that look like my parents made them in their childhood it will probably be quite embarrassing. In the process of progress, we discover opportunities for new stuff (e.g. new interactions, new styles, new perspectives, new ways to use something, etc.) all the time. However currently we hold on to that retro trend as hard as we can. Shouldn't we reinvent the wheel and not just wheel back 40 years in fashion, style and music?

Here's a new version of a camera app, that abstracts images even more:

How does this help us? 
What is the benefit in looping history and copying styles from about 40 years ago?

I built a video for him to use *to propose to his missus.* I'm somewhat put out that there has been an initial interest in payment for what is essentially a niche skillset- aside from the fact we met on the internet/reddit which has then been totally retracted upon.

The central idea is that brand owners are less able to control the message and the use of their content now, and that they need to properly react to this new reality. I know there's a lot written on the subject of social media marketing, but I'm hoping that the remix culture take on it will be a bit more fresh and interesting (rather than ""how to harness the internet to get as many likes as possible and shove your product down people's throats"").

A few examples include the [McDonalds Video Game](http://www.mcvideogame.com/index-eng.html), the [Volkswagen Terrorist Commercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnL-7x4n4d8) and the [Skittles Wedding Night Commercial](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xk3hee_skittles-wedding-night_fun) (on the flipside, the Skittles website encourages a lot of participation and user content).

I'm currently reading Lawrence Lessig's *Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy*, but I was wondering if anyone knows of any other books, articles, or examples of brands becoming more open and inclusive? I'm also interested in hearing anyone's views on the matter.

I’m getting older now to the point I’m realising I'd like to make this hobby my living eventually, and now is a better time than ever to get started.


My problem is in the past I've had the odd job from people, usually friends and family, or friends of friends and family, I will create something that looks good and they'll love it, but its very rarely what they’re after, and I never have anything to back up why I like it or why I think it works, and sometimes I know myself its not right for them either.


I usually go into these kind of jobs by just creating something straight away until its good. I never do research or brainstorms etc. and I think its because I'm not sure on how to go about it.

So if anyone has any links to helpful articles or guides to the research and development process, or even books I could buy, it would be appreciated.

tl;dr I need some links to articles/guides on the research and development aspect of the design process.

1290011767.0	e7kuf	What would a Reddit logo design process look like?	rsantaferraro	1	1	0	"Forgive me if this has been brought up before, but I got to thinking, could the reddit format be used to create a meaningful logo?

Most design by the masses on the internet occurs in the form of design “competitions” of which I, along with most designers, am not a fan. Reddit would allow to do more of a design collaboration. Here’s how I can picture it working:

1.	We find someone in need of a logo and identity.

2.	We create a thread for research wherein redditors create the basis for the brand and we upvote the best insights and demographic information. People can reply to any of these giving a forum to expand on or refute the original comment.

3.	Next, we create a brainstorming thread. Using what we learned in the previous thread. People can put out words, ideas and the community can upvote good ideas and comment on them to refine them.

4.	Finally, we create a design thread to develop the ideas from the brainstorming into actual comps. Once again, the commenting and upvoting would be an integral part of the critiquing and refining process.

While this simplifies and formulizes what should be a more organic process, it would be an interesting experiment. It gets rid of the major flaws of the design competition by involving everyone in all parts of the process and making the research available to everyone. Instead of hundreds of half-baked and superficial logos, we would be putting our minds together to make a single unified identity. Collaboration as the number one goal could produce infinitely better results.

I do, however, acknowledge a few drawbacks to this experiment, the largest of which being compensation. A main gripe of the design competition is all of the free work weaseled out of those who don’t win, not to mention that the sum received by the winner is often far below what a real logo should cost a company. Having the process on reddit also eliminates the possibility of even thinking of compensation because the final would be based upon the work of the community not the person who finishes the process up.

To solve this, I would propose treating this as an experiment, or even like pro bono work. The spirit of altruism is a powerful one on reddit, so the project would have to be treated like that. Perhaps we find a charity or something of the like to design for.

What are your thoughts, reddit? I’m just developing this in my head and am excited to see what this could be. In true reddit fashion, feel free to refine my idea. It is by no means complete. And while I by no means think this would become a regular thing, it could be fun to try once."	t5_2qvgd	True
