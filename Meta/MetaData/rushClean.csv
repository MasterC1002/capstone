1347753935.0	zy6ah	Does anyone else think the Watchmaker has taken over /r/rush?		93	15	25	"I'm not usually very acerbic in my reddit comments, but I have to say our lone mod here seems like an asshole (my apologies, Antidote, if you're in fact a super swell person).  **NO RAGE COMICS, NO IMAGE MEMES**, no...cardboard boxes?  Was there a cardboard box problem I missed?

[And now this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/rush/comments/z6y15/this_subreddit_is_now_text_posts_only/)  Excuse me?  Why is this subreddit becoming a weird dictatorship?  How exactly does Antidote define ""karma whoring""?  And why has he/she seen fit to label our image posts as ""pointless"", and grubbing for karma?  Does Antidote have some inside knowledge of our secret intentions?  If I post an imgur link of a band photo, is that my wishing to share a great picture of our favorite band with other Rush fans, or am I merely trying to horde imaginary internet points?  *Only Antidote has the answer!*

Here's my guess: Antidote is kind of a dick.  I run four subreddits, all of which I created, for a combined subscribership of over 8,000.  That doesn't make me an expert, but it does give me insight into what it takes to manage active subreddits; which is, not fucking much.  You check the spam filter, help out other redditors from time to time, maybe offer guidance on the direction of the subreddit, from design to content.  But you don't simply hand down a list of don'ts from on high and expect everyone to go merrily along.

Hey Antidote, why don't you be more like Owen, or Cygnus, or the driver of the red barchetta, and less like the Watchmaker, or Apollo, or the cops in their alloy air cars?  If we want to post fucking pictures, it doesn't mean we're trying to horde pretend computer points (and even if we were, so fucking what?).  Stop making arbitrary rules.  Stop telling us what we *can't* do.  Stop being a dick.  Yes, you created /r/rush.  You got to the name first.  That doesn't make you right, however.  It just makes you responsible.  Responsible to the nearly 3,000 Rush fans who just want to have a shared experience about their favorite band - and if that means posting image links, then big fucking deal.  Don't like image links?  See a shrink, because that's a weird problem to have.  After all, what are the arrows for if not to let redditors judge their own content?

Let people do what they want, and they'll vote accordingly.  If they don't like rage comics, or memes, or image links, they'll ignore them (or downvote them).  Let us decide for ourselves what we want.  

Are you the Solar Federation?

Or are you the Starman?

**Edit:**  After some careful thought, I'd like to apologize for my tone of voice, and for stooping to call Antidote nasty names.  It was wrong of me, and I genuinely feel bad about it.  I'm leaving my post as is, as something of a self reminder what not to do in the future.  Antidote, I'm sorry for being rude.

My overall argument, however, remains unchanged.  "	t5_2r4wq	True

A local radio station (KISW) was doing a contest each morning, where you had to answer a trivia question, and if you answered correctly you could name as many albums (artist + album name) in 10 seconds, and you would win those albums.

So, I called in one morning while at work and successfully answered the trivia question.  I then said the following albums in 10 seconds:
* Rush - Rush
* Rush - Fly by Night
* Rush - Caress of Steel
* Rush - 2112
* Rush - All the World's a Stage
* Rush - A Farewell to Kings
* Rush - Hemispheres
* Rush - Permanant Waves
* Rush - Moving Pictures
* Rush - Exit Stage Left

I was just starting to name the next album when time ran out.

For the rest of the contest (which went on for about 1 month more), they played my clip as a promo to the show.

I said I had been listening to them all of my life since my father introduced me to them. We talked about Rush for a bit, and then I learned something interesting about him.

It turns out that this man was Rush's private chef during the time they recorded A Farewell to Kings! He told me that the guys were his favorite clients, since they told him he could cook whatever he pleased - as long as the food and a bottle of red wine were on the table by the time M\*A\*S\*H was on tv.

1353363197.0	13h1s9	A spectacle like you've never seen	conkerit	60	6	15	"I have been a devoted Rush fan for years and years. I learned the guitar on Rush songs. I've listened to and loved EVERY album for years and years. I've gone to see them live many times, and they just keep getting better.

I went to the Anaheim show over the weekend, and my life has since changed. Not only was the setlist amazing, and the playing better than ever, Clockwork Angels blew my mind. The album is great, and I've been enjoying it since it came out, but hearing it live? This is music that was written to be played live. The album does it very little justice. Rush is an acquired musical taste, and this album is the most acquired taste within their catalog. You can't enjoy this music fully the first few times you hear it. I cried when they played their show. I was mesmerized, amazed, and just really really happy. I stood around outside the hotel ALL night long singing Rush with some awesome people. This show just tops anything anyone has done musically, ever.
This music was not meant to be stuck on your speakers, or in your headphones. The best way to hear it, is straight from the glorious people who created it.

Feel free to disagree, agree, or comment, but nothing will change my mind."	t5_2r4wq	True

The instrument tones. 

The strings. 

The vocals. 

It's UNREAL. I have this feeling that every other artist should just give up music. There's no topping this. It's utter perfection. It's just... Right. 

The concept - how it relates to Neil's life, as well as the Watchmaker steam punk story - as well as the overarching religious and philosophical points. 

It's heaven. I have no words to describe it. 

I almost cried when listening to The Garden. And the riff in Seven Cities is so good, I can't put it into words. It speaks to me. Both bass and guitar. 

All I can do is squeak. It's changed my life. 

This album has completely changed my life. 

In a word lit only by fire.

""the problem with Rush- you have to hold off til the end of the evening- because after Rush, despite how many other great band i love to listen to- NOTHING can follow Rush.
They are like Queen at Live Aid- Absolutely nothing could follow.
Mozart claims his music was made by God-
God claims his music is made by Rush.""

On the musical side of things, while I am usually very picky when I go to live concerts when it comes to record deviations (I got a little upset when I saw that the string section was remaining on the stage, ready to play, as Neil began the famous intro to YYZ), I ended up really enjoying the extra color the strings added to the song. They were not intrusive, but additive. Kudos to whoever did the arranging on that one.

""Clockwork Angels"" (the song) was also amazing. The music and stage presentation reached quite a climax during the chorus; I've only listened to that album two or three times, but it has just been added to my Christmas list.

Tl;dr: First Rush concert, was blown away in general but especially loved YYZ with strings.

Rush is playing the instruments (DRUMS/GTR/KEYS) and a couple of their roadies (Jack Secret and Skip Gildersleeve) are on vox and bass. JS may have written the entire song. Does not sound like Peart's lyrics.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6bbV1bZO8

Neil, did, however contribute lyrics to another Jack Secret song released in 2008 called White Flag.

Listen here: http://www.myspace.com/jsecret1/music/songs/white-flag-30140850

Lyrics attributed to Neil:

&gt;This is all we care to see /
Madness in the streets /
Talk about a sorry state /
Talk about the heat /
If caught take it easy /
While many take it hard /

&gt;It seems we always play the dealer /
Who holds the winning card /
Someone rise in anger /
Someone raise a voice /
Someone ask a question /
Someone make a choice /
There’s no time to surrender /
No time to rejoice /
We’ve been a long, long, long time /

&gt;Watchful and cool /
We can ride out the hurricane /
Restless and wet /
Pretend to fight again and again /
Steady and strong /
We can learn to clean the earth and sky /
We can learn to laugh and cry /
It’s a long, hard climb /

&gt;Watchful and cool in the heat of a dangerous summer /
It’s been a long, long, long time /
Restless and wet /
With the storm and the sweat of the struggle /
It’s been a long, long, long time /
Steady and strong like the struggle of a long-distance swimmer /
Spirits may sag, but we can’t show the flag or surrender /

&gt;It’s been a long, long, long time /
It’s been a long, long, long time"	t5_2r4wq	True

1355181362.0	14mqtg	A thank you to my favorite band	losthiker68	41	6	1	"I participated in a tradition this November about thankfulness.  Every day for the month of November, you post a FB status with something you are thankful for that day.  I told myself that I would never pick some cop-out thing, but something I was legitimately thankful for.

This was my post for November 29, the day after the Rush concert here in Dallas.  I thought I would share it with my fellow Rush fans.

Nov 29 – I am thankful for my favorite band, Rush. They put on an amazing show last night - deep cuts I've not heard since the late '80s, a string ensemble, the classics, everything you would want from a great band with a long career. However, they deserve a spot in this list not for one show but for a lifetime of great memories.

I discovered them around 1981 when a friend introduced me to their music. They were the first band I really got into because they were the first band whose lyrics really spoke to me in a very personal way, like the songs had been written just for me. Until then, I never knew music had that kind of magic. Their drummer/lyricist, Neil Peart, once said, “Our music is the soundtrack of their &lt;the fan’s&gt; lives…” and he was absolutely correct. My life’s soundtrack is dominated by their music and the bands they influenced. They were my first introduction to progressive rock/metal, of which I have become an ardent fan, especially later in life. In times of sorrow, their music is what saved me. I could put on my headphones, sit back in my chair, close my eyes and become lost in the images. It was an escape no drug could ever match.

Geddy, Neil &amp; Alex (aka Dirk, Pratt &amp; Lerxst), thank you for a lifetime of joyful memories. Your music has made me smile when nothing else would. Neil, your book “Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road” was a life changer for me, and it may have even saved it. May you continue to make such wonderful music, and give us such wonderful memories, for so long as you desire."	t5_2r4wq	True

They are amazing musicians, have science fiction type of lyrics, completely conceptual, and pay homage to Rush in multiple songs. They even have a song entitled [2113](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gcik1ZMTDv8) You can really hear the similarity at 5:10-5:30 in the video.

I'm curious if anyone has any other ""new"" bands that remind them of Rush. Anyone?

Here's the translation:

Well here we are.

It's been a long road, but wow.

They've got a nice green room back there.

Thank goodness, because it was pain in the ass getting here, driving, flying, whatever.

So here's how it happened:

Tom Sawyer, that iconic opening, guitar drums, and Geddy's voice. 

It was a hit!  There was sudden increased fame and attention from the music industry.

After that, we saw our name in lights!

We saw our name in lights!

That's me!  That's us!  We'll be in the Hall of Fame!

No you won't!

Why not?

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 789 gold records?!

That's not good enough!

What, why?

Why?

You're nerds!

Fine.  Fuck it.

Then.  Time passed.  We toured.  We flew, we played.  Decades passed.

Then one day, just minding my own business, and the phone rang.

Hello?

Hi.

Really?!

Are you kidding?

Thank-you, Goodbye

WE WERE IN!

It was the Hall of Fame

So I got all gussied up, and headed out.

I have a list of people to thank:

All of you, and our manager...

And of course, these guys... (cries)

Ah fuck it, you all know who you are.

All I'd really like to say to you, and of course with these guys, Neil, Geddy:

It's YOU, THE FANS THAT MADE THIS HAPPEN.  I'm truly honored, and Thank-you so much.

"	QuestionNAnswer	36	6	37	"I watch people bash rush's mid 80's era stuff all day long.  I see life long fans much older than I wearing shirts that say ""working man"" get pissed at concerts when rush plays ""Time Stand Still"" or ""Digital Man.""  

Frankly as a guitarist, drummer, and bassist, and I love Lifeson's mid 80s work.  I see him exploring different approaches to guitar, since geddy's keys take a rhythm guitar part that sometimes switches to lead on some tracks, It's cool to me as a guitarist to see how Lifeson handles this.  On tracks Like ""Grand Design"" off Power windows, he manages to work with the huge synth guitar stuff to create a musical aurora of sweet perfection, which somehow, his guitar comes alive through the mix.  I love it.  

I love the 80's rock reggae style on some songs, like digital man, i love the drums on The Analog Kid, the keys, everything.  

Don't get me wrong, I love Limelight, I love ""Anthem,"" ""The Trees,""  I love the early mid and late rush, I still regard my favorite rush song as ""La Villa Strangiato"" but I don't think the 80's keyboard driven rush era gets the credit it desserves, even by the band.

On ""Beyond the lighted stage"" when they interview Alex he states some stuff about 80s where he had a hard time fitting in and finding his role, but he says that it wasn't a memorable era. I disagree.  I sense he feels uneasy with it, but I think that era showcases his finest work as a guitarist and as a musician rediscovering a new style of playing while simultaneously developing a new position for his guitar in the new sound.

I think Peart's lyrical content was at its height during this era as well.  

I guess what I'm trying to get to, am I alone in loving Rush's most hated era?

I would also say that once the band comes to grips with this era of their library and finally embrases it as good work, they can add some good elements back into their writing and have some better new material.  I'm not sure, but I think the newer Rush stuff is trying too hard to sound like ""early rush"" pre-hemispheres...

Here's another fun connection, though this one might just be a coincidence....maybe.

Step 1:
Think hard about Neil Peart and his individualist values as represented in songs like Anthem and The Body Electric....

Step 2:
Convert the number of the ""humanoid escapee, android on the run"" -- 1001001 -- from binary to decimal (base 10). Doing so converts from a computer-based to a human-based numbering system.

http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~gurwitz/core5/nav2tool.html

Step 3:
Now convert this number from decimal into ASCII code. ASCII is a coding scheme based on the alphabet: we're converting numbers into letters, code into language.

http://www.asciitable.com/

The letter you find is the forbidden word in Ayn Rand's novel ANTHEM, and also the word that defines Asimov's ""Robot"" as a true, autonomous living self. :)

Thoughts, here? Coincidence? A serendipitous one, if so!

1324589960.0	nn3xv	The time I made Alex Lifeson laugh		35	4	10	"So it's 1990/1991, I'm 16 or 17, and I get wind that Alex Lifeson will be hosting a celebrity charity tennis tournament near my high school.  By this time, I've been listening to Rush for about 6 years, and they've replaced The Beatles as my most favoritest band evar.  So I strongarm my brother, who kinda likes Rush, and a couple friends, who kinda don't, into going with me, because some people are just fucking wrong and need to be educated.

The ""celebrities"" at the event are a hilarious leftover of C-list 90s TV hacks and local news anchors (including the outrageously named weathermen Dallas Raines and Johnny Mountain).  Alan Thicke is there (kind of a dick).  I don't recall another single person, because I'm there solely to shake the hand of one man - Lerxst.

Stand in line at a signing booth before the matches begin, FUCKING MEET ALEX LIFESON, FUCKING SHAKE HIS GODDAMN PICKING, STRUMMING HAND, FUCKING GET HIS MOTHERFUCKING SIGNATURE, mumble something unintelligble, shuffle off with the rest of the nerds, gobsmacked, speechless and probably pissing a little.

Then they start playing tennis.  The ""celebrities"" break up into different teams (sorry, I'm not a tennis fan - groups?  pairs?  whatever), and of course I only give a shit about wherever Alex is playing.  We crowd into the bleachers, they enter the court, an announcer relieves us all of having to guess who the fuck these huge Hollywood stars are, then introduces the main guest of the event, one Aleksandar Živojinović.  I scream like a girl and embarrass everyone around me.  Others do the same, and fellow Rush addicts nod at each other knowingly from across the stands.  *And then my moment in the sun...*

The opposing team/group/couple serve first.  Alex and his partner crouch as tennis players do, waiting.  The server hits...and the ball goes straight into the net.  Silence.  Now, I don't know much about tennis, but I do know that's a bad thing.  Before the server could have a second go, in a moment of uncharacteristic genius, and never to be replicated again, I jump up from my bench and yell, ""GOOD JOB, ALEX!! WOOO!!"", and clap furiously like only a pubescent, brain damaged Rush fan can.

The crowd goes nuts, Alex genuinely laughs his ass off, and even bows to me with a majestic sweep of his racquet.  It's fucking bliss, I tell you.  In his mind, it's a funny thing that's no doubt instantly forgotten.  In my mind, it is the sudden culmination of every dream of being cool at the right time I'd ever had.  Raddest fucking experience ever.

Naturally, I screw it up.  A few minutes later, a bad opposing serve happens again.  The budding adult in me knows you can't tell the same joke twice and expect similar results.  The hyperactive nerd in me, still reveling in recent glory, tells the budding adult to shut the fuck up.  Yeah.  It doesn't go so well the second time around, and I think Alex is a bit embarrassed that some jackass kid in the bleachers is hollering at him.  From hero to zero in five minutes flat.  Good job, dipshit.

Anyway, that's my story.  If nothing else, I gave something insignificantly small back to the man who's given me so much more over the years, and it felt great.

1. Circumstances
      
   Great, shorter song with dark and Rush-esque lyrics. Truly a song that defines Rush.

2. Xanadu
     
   One of the more epic, edgy songs by Rush. Great exhibition of musical and thematic talent.

3. Fly by Night
      
   Roots rock with a bit of proggy goodness thrown in. Very melodic and one of my favorites on bass.

4. Subdivisions
      
   Very revealing song showing our human tendencies. Great guitar here.

5. Cygnus X-1: Books I&amp;II
     
   This would be my favorite if Rush didn't have so many good dang songs. Long story song full of musical texture and emotion. The battle of Heart and Mind!

In ""Of the Battle"" of By-Tor and the Snow Dog, I know that Geddy is By-Tor and Lifeson is the Snow Dog (it's stated on the back of the album), and that the Snow Dog is the super-high, frantic and screeching guitar. But what on Earth is Geddy doing to make that crazy demonic noise? I believe it's the same thing used in the Necromancer in the middle instrumental transition."	t5_2r4wq	True

KalYuga	30	4	40	"Putting aside the deadly sins of recording in a concert hall and falling prey to the ""loudness wars"", this is my favourite album from these guys. There is so much more of their soul infused into this work, bringing forth the best of their songwriting capabilities and love for subtle nuances. The darker tone to the lyrics is a nice touch. When I revisit their previous material, I now find myself disappointed with the now absent layers upon layers of sound just waiting to be mentally chewed on — there is so much ""less"" to old millenium Rush. 
  

I take it that I am a very small minority in saying this. I mean, I've always had the suspicion that this album wasn't very well received by people. I'm wondering if it's because the extremely poor production shrouds much of what is going on in any given song. For example, in the One Little Victory remix on Retrospectives III, I was surprised at how much easier it was to mentally process and cognitively break it all down. There were certain nuances and sounds that I had never been able to hear before. It's a shame how it all turned out, really."	t5_2r4wq	True

The first half is an 80's explosion. The second half is most of Clockwork Angels, followed up with some more historical goodness, including a Neil Armstrong tribute. 

Neil does several small solos intertwined in songs, something I'm happy to see him return to. 

Geddy sounds good. I was worried about his voice... But he's still on the ball. The bass playing is insane. 

Lerxst, just amazing. The man deserves more awards.

While these have Rush related themes to them they are not about Rush and prompt no discussion about Rush and as such I am considering removing new submissions that are just an image of a barely Rush related thing.

Feel free to comment on this and lets see if we can't come up with a well defined solution (for example what exactly is a barely Rush related thing.)

Thank you

Edit:

Currently I'm thinking of not changing the submission policy very much but I will of course be monitoring the state of submissions.  If subreddit traffic increases to the point that we're overwhelmed with barely relevant images then I'll consider stricter rules.

As for now the only change I'm going to make is that an image has something related to Rush in it.  So a picture of room number 2112 is acceptable but a picture of your cat that you happened to name 'Cygnus' or 'By-Tor' or whatever is not.

We were assigned a project in which we had to design an art show and gallery to display it in, and were given free reign as to what we wanted to show. I, being the classic rock music nut that I am, immediately thought ""album covers"". so, along with Robin Trower, and Yes, I chose Rush as the subjects of my art showing. 
Now, with the project being as detailed as it was, I needed the actual sizes and materials of the original works used for the RUSH covers. I couldn't find them listed anywhere online, so out of desperation, I sent an email to Hugh Syme, the Very man responsible for all but 2 of the album covers (who also regularly shows up on some of the songs playing the piano...most notably on Different Strings). 
I was expecting to get a nicely said ""fuck off"" from a secretary, but instead I got a reply from hugh himself who seemed very interested in what I was doing, and asked me to call him the next day at his office.
I called him, and he could not be a more genuine, nice person. I got a few measurements and he went into some great detail about how some of the album covers were made, so for those of you interested...

Moving Pictures: was originally a blank wall, with a nail and a dusty outline of a picture frame that had been moved. The band didn't think it was cinematic enough, so they had him redo it. The photographer that took the actual cover photo is the witch in the picture on the cover, who was almost really burned during the photo shoot for the witch picture. Hugh told me that they had to get her very drunk before she agreed to let them throw gas soaked rags by her feet and light them on fire.

Permanent Waves: was done using a photo enlarger, and basically manually photo shopped together. The most interesting note, is that in the original photo, the newspaper's headline was ""Dewey defeats Truman"", but they had to change it and eventually remove it due to some legal bullshit.

and finally, Roll the bones: The kid in the picture is the son of someone that works with Hugh, and the sidewalk and water at the bottom were all real, built as a set inside the studio for the photo shoot.

That's all I remember of specific details about the album covers, other than the fact that he cringed when I mentioned hemispheres. I think I remember him saying it was a ""disaster"" 
After all that business, we talked on the phone for about another 10 minutes, just shooting the shit, and I had one hell of a day, and one hell of a project to present."	t5_2r4wq	True

I'm not going to tell you where to download it (like it's that hard to guess where it is), but I don't feel bad, since I have already pre-ordered two different versions, and spent over 500 on tickets for the fall. If you don't buy this album, please don't download it either, support the band we all love.

Anyway, I'm going to lay in my bed with headphones and have a listen. Goodnight, and I'll see you all on the other side!

Edit: Confirmed. I listened to it last night. Not bad. The album is more about Geddy, than Alex or Neil, but that's the only disappointment. I think I'm gonna like it more each time I listen to it, just like every other Rush album. It was too dense and full for me to really have an opinion at this stage.

But with recent chatter that this may be Rush's last hurrah, I'm not taking any chances.  My lovely wife has already agreed to let me fly down for the show in Seattle, and I figured there may be others out there who'd like to see Rush with fellow redditors.  Maybe we can set something up in /r/Rush to help connect fans with each other, like a calendar or checklist in the sidebar, or even just self posts like this announcing that you're willing to travel, or host someone who is.

That said, is there anyone who plans on going to the Seattle show?  I'd love to meet some fellow redditors and Rush nerds, and I'd be down for splitting a hotel room, or even paying for some couch space.

Let me know what you guys think, and maybe we can put together a support network for wayward air drummers.  "	t5_2r4wq	True

For me, I'd say the most overrated is Moving Pictures. Yes, it's a great album, but I don't think it's their best, as it's generally listed. At the very least, Permanent Waves and 2112 are better.

The most underrated, in my view, is Counterparts. I have no idea why this album doesn't get more attention than it does. I hardly ever see it mentioned on fan boards. The album is Rush's triumphant return to hard rock after their '80s synth period, the songs are quite heavy (especially the guitar; Alex is really the star of this album), and Neil's lyrics are, in my opinion, some of his best. I also love Vapor Trails. Yes, the sound quality could be improved somewhat, but this was never a huge issue for me. Looking beyond that, the level of song writing and instrumentation is so high I can easily overlook any production issues.

1. Analog Kid.  Alex nailed the solo.  Nailed it to the fucking wall!
2. The ten moving screens-- for [Clockwork Angels](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-Z0xijcOks) and [The Anarchist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfmsKLrEnFc), especially.  This is what I was referring to when I used the word ""spectacular.""  I'd submit the picture I took during CA, but my shitty phone didn't do it justice; not even a little bit. EDIT: I found someone else's YouTube footage; see hyperlinks.  Wow.
3. The Clockwork Angels String Ensemble.  Super tasty, especially during Manhattan Project and YYZ.
4. Neil's choices for electronic drum sounds for the solo before Red Sector A.  
5. All the fans on the floor in Section 4, stage right, Alex-side.  Like my friend commented, it was like a family reunion-- you don't necessarily know anybody, but you know you all have something in common, so fuck it, let's get tipsy and have a good time!  The people in my section had a great time and my voice still isn't back to normal.  =)

Two side notes:

To the two teenaged girls in front of us whose parents apparently forced them to come (Your R30 Tour t-shirts disguised you well): You texted during the show, sat down for about 1/3 of it, and PLAYED PATTY-CAKE at one point.  But you were nice to indulge your folks.  I just wish you would have given up your floor seats to somebody who would have used them better.  I don't feel one bit guilty about singing nearly every line of the show full-throated at the backs of your heads.  So, nyah.  =P

Becky from Orlando who, like me, flew in to see the show: you're awesome and I'm really pissed at you for being able to sneak up to your friends in the fourth row!  Thanks for the pre-show laughs and for taking pictures of a bunch of math-rock nerds on their night out.

Spread the word: Somehow at age 59-60, this band is at its peak.  People need to see this show.  Don't let anybody tell you, ""Oh, yeah, well, I saw Rush in 19xx already.""  Nuh-uh.  They didn't see this tour, and it's a sight to behold.  Worth every dollar.

Geddy has usually enunciated very clearly and I could understand most everything first time, but not on this album.  Anyway, some good songs, just what I expected, but it did not blow me away.

Until the end.


The Garden.


Maybe it's because it's my birthday and I'm ""older"" now.  Maybe it's because my oldest son just turned 18 and graduated high school.  I don't know, but this song did something to me. 


""The measure of a life is a measure of love and respect

So hard to earn so easily burned

In the fullness of time

A garden to nurture and protect

(Its a measure of a life)

The treasure of a life is a measure of love and respect

The way you live the gifts that you give

And the fullness of time is the only return I do expect 


The future dissapears to memory

With only a moment between

Forever dwells in that moment

Hope is what remains to be seen""


And then Alex's BEAUTIFUL solo.  I listened to that song three or four times in a row and I have not heard it enough yet.  This now ranks as one of my absolute favorite songs by Rush and reminds me why I love them so.
