An apology to redditor watEvery1_isThinking.	akrabu	244	49	99	"[A fellow redditor posts a question to r/knives asking for advice about karambits.](http://www.reddit.com/r/knives/comments/plq68/looking_for_a_small_foldable_karambit_for_every/) The replies to his question were condescending at best. Do you think this individual is going to feel comfortable bringing his questions to [/r/knives](/r/knives) again? If I were him I wouldn't. I would unsubscribe because I would assume everyone here is going to be a huge know-it-all dick every time I ask a question.

Not everyone who visits [/r/knives](/r/knives) has a golden display case full of benchmades and a decade of intense interest in knives under their belts. There is no reason this can't be a great place for everyone with every level of interest in knives. 

[/r/knives](/r/knives) isn't the place to find newbs to pick on. I made it because I loved redditors and I loved knives. I hated that there was no decent place to talk knives without approaching the subject in a cautious and guarded manner. I hated that there was no place to talk knives where there weren't a bunch of bullying know-it-all pricks waiting for some newb to come along with a question so they could flood their thread with condescension and insults. It used to be this was the last place on the internet I would expect to see that sort of attitude, and it pains me to see it here now.

I can only speak for myself, but I am sorry watEvery1_isThinking. I hope the reception to your post hasn't put you off about our subreddit. I personally love karambits as an EDC utility knife. Most super-pro knife enthusiasts enjoy talking shit about them though. Sorry dude!

I should probably give some background on what happened.  Basically, walking across campus last night.  Not terribly late or anything.  As I'm going around the side of one of the dorms this guy just steps around the corner.  He's holding a fixed blade, says he wants me to empty my pockets.  I wasn't sure what was even happening and I just held my hands out at my sides and felt confused.  He got frustrated, jabbed at me.  I probably should have done the whole mcmap twist over the head stuff, but not a lot of thinking was going on.  I just grabbed his wrist, and as I pushed it down I pulled my pocket knife clipped in my shorts (crkt m21), flipped it open, and swung it up pretty blindly.  He lets go of his and holds his face, just staring at me.  I may have hurt him in the nose or lips?

We just stared at each other for what felt like forever, though probably just a couple shocked seconds, me holding both our knives just stunned at what happened.  And then he sprints off.   

I've read the link on the side, but, the knife isn't the worst option right?  Just not the best?  Certainly not the reason I carry, I know, but it's still relevant?



Also, if anyone knows where I can get a sheath for a Gerber LMF that'd be great!




*EDIT BELOW*

So just a few things to get out there to everyone
*I did file a police report right after.  Gave the whole story, they were cool about it.  I feel pretty trusting of government personally.  I think that if I'm candid and honest and relaxed they'll be the same way.
* I have hurt my hand, not like requiring stitches or anything (I've had that before though, stabbed to the bone in the center of the palm), but just cut across the fingers.  I'm thinking that I may have grabbed his knife by the blade when I took it?

1336934294.0	tl99w	I'm going to give you all this one time, one time only, so sticky it or bookmark or whatever (cough mods lol) How To Sharpen.	atomedge	173	39	80	"Step one: Determine what needs to be done with your blade: Are there dings? Is the edge rolled over? Is the blade chipped? Is the tip broken off? Does the knife's edge angle need re profiling?  These questions and their answers will help you to determine where you'll want to start your sharpening process.

Step 2: Clean your knife, use soap and water to get all the gunk off your blade, you don't want food particles, or nonsense to get stuck in your sharpening stone.

Step 3 (Sharpening): To start sharpening, lets say you wanna put a new edge on the blade. Start at about a 15 degree angle (To make an angle guide, fold a piece of paper at the corner, two times, this will make a 22.5 degree angle (good for finishing in this case) which will help you get an idea for a 15 degree angle, just imagine lowering the back of your blade more than this angle, or use a protractor to figure it out if you really want to.  

Step 4 (Sharpening): Once your angle has been established, throw some water on your stone (If you have an already oiled oil stone, do that or whatever) I suggest water for any stones that I use, as oil sucks and is a mess, if you've already put oil on your oil stone though, you're stuck unless you boil the heck out of it. Then on the roughest stone, start scrubbing away using full sweeping strokes across the whole edge, GOING LIGHTLY (if you really press hard your stone will dish out and you'll have a hard time getting the scratches out). After a bit of scrubbing on one side, feel for a burr. Glide your finger tips across (NOT ALONG) the edge, the side opposite the grinding should catch a bit, this is a burr. Once you feel a burr on one side, you've hit your edge apex, flip the knife and do the same, til you hit a burr, using the same angles.

Step 5 (De-burr): Once you've built a burr on both sides, take a piece of wood, your shoe sole, a piece of cardboard, cork, plastic, a bic lighter, whatever you want that isn't metal or ceramic, and slice into it with the knife like 10 times, using light pressure. This will knock off that little extra flap of metal we call a burr, and leave you with a clean (abiet dull) edge apex to work with, at same angle as your back bevel (I know, I didn't tell you that this is what we were doing all along, but oh well). You can either at this point, keep the same angle and polish the bevel with the medium and fine stone, taking the same steps as before and have a very keen edge, which may suffer from less durability, OR you can do that, and go to the next step.

Step 6 (Micro Bevel): Remember that 22.5 degree angle guide? Now that you've got a nice 15 degree bevel on your knife, turn to the fine, or medium stones you've got (if you only have one stone, just use that). Now use edge trailing strokes at this higher angle, 5 per side, then 4 per side, then 3,2,1 etc. going to one stroke per side, and repeating that one stroke per side about 15 or 20 times, then go to your next finest stone and do the same. When you pull the edge across instead of push it, it smooths the blade and gives you a crisp V geometry, by not slamming the edge of the knife into imperfections in the stone, but rather gently pulling it over them. After this step, your knife should be sharp as heck, but you can do more to get that extra craziness out of your knife's edge.

Step 7 (Strop that shit): Okay, find some smooth leather, a piece of cardboard, a smooth piece of soft wood. Okay, now go to the buffing wheel section of your favorite local hardware store and get a stick of polishing compound and rub it on the leather, cardboard, or wood or whatever you have. Then do the same step in step 6. This will smooth out your edge a bit more, align the micro serrations, and give your edge it's optimum keenness. Your edge ought to shave hairs by this point if your angles are consistent.



This is all you need for basic sharpening, experiment and figure out more through study and practice.


edit: Sharpening Serrations: ""1 toothpick, 1 piece of 600 and 1000 grit sandpaper. Taking into account you don't abuse the shit out of your knives, this is all you need. Wrap the sandpaper around the toothpick and glue it. Figure that part out, it's pretty cut and dry (pun). Next balance your little toothpick sharpener on a serration so it balances properly on the flat of the edge. Now that you've found your angle, push away from the edge with the toothpick making sure to get the whole portion of the serration. Do that til you can feel a burr on the other side you've been sanding. Then lay the toothpick flat on the flat of the opposite side you've been working on once you've done it to all your serrations, and do the same thing then cut a strip of cardboard to deburr and lightly do what you'd just done a few minutes ago.

He gave it to me for Valentine's Day in 2003. It was crafted by [this very cool man,](http://atar.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=53) who has a Ph.D. in metallurgy and specializes in pattern-welding and meteoric iron forging. 

[This picture shows the sword and scabbard.](http://i.imgur.com/W0uMP.jpg) The scabbard was crafted by a Massachusetts artisan out of leather, bronze, and black star diopsides.

[And here is a close-up of the pattern-welding on the sword and the hilts.](http://i.imgur.com/FfjSS.jpg)

The metal for the sword blade was from a meteorite that was part of the Nantan meteor shower that struck China in 1516ish. "	t5_2qzyn	True

1366831556.0	1d12bz	Let's talk about value. Here's a list of best bang for the buck knives.	jdd32	126	25	75	"First let me say that there seems to always be some conflict on this subreddit regarding cheaper brand knives. A lot of people get called out for being snobs when they criticize someone's cheap colt or S&amp;W or other off brand knife. And there's always comment saying ""you don't need to spend $100+ on a knife!...ect""

Let me tell you that no one who is a ""knife person"" thinks you need to spend that kind of cash to get a good knife. However, they will say that you need to look to find value; value meaning a knife with quality materials and construction for the price. I've said it before, showing off your $5 hardware store knife here is like posting a picture of a beat up old pinto on a car forum. No one wants to see that. But if you spend your cash, even &lt;$20, on a quality knife then you'll get nothing but compliments on this subreddit.

Here's a list of some of the best bang-for-the-buck knives out there that I swiped from an old post on another forum. There are probably plenty more that have come out since this list was made. 

So if you're looking for a quality knife without breaking the bank, this is the list for you!

1329408839.0	psfmd	Giving Away a BHK Woodsman Pro!		128	28	89	"***THE WINNER:*** Alright folks, it's the time you've ALL been waiting for, the winner shall be announced! I'd like to start by saying, I truly wish I could send each of you a knife. I'm actually kind of sad that the contest is over, to be honest, but keep your eyes open because I'll be giving away a [ZT] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014DXZT0/ref=ox_sc_act_title_9?ie=UTF8&amp;m=ATVPDKIKX0DER) and a [TOPS] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ZTPFLU/ref=ox_sc_act_title_7?ie=UTF8&amp;m=A2Z4TNRIG1DC3H) very soon. To those of you who didn't win, please don't get discouraged. Check out the knives Blind Horse has to offer (some are actually pretty affordable), and keep this tradition going folks. Now, the winner is..... [onyxsamurai] (http://www.reddit.com/user/onyxsamurai)! Onyxsamurai, thank you for your submission. I wish you the absolute best and hope you keep me updated on things to come. Be sure to post a picture of that knife once you get it! [Ecvdingos], (http://www.reddit.com/user/ecvdingoz) you too will be getting a knife in the mail. I really enjoyed your submission, and it put quite the smile on my face.

Everyone else, again, thank you. I've loved doing this competition and being a part of this whole thing in general.
Like I said, more contests will be on the way, so, keep an eye out! 











~~As many of you probably remember, [chefmatthew](http://www.reddit.com/user/chefmatthew) gave away a Kershaw Tanto Blur not to long ago. While I didn't win the contest, it did inspire me to go out and buy one for myself. Truly an amazing knife. And it got me to thinking...""maybe I could influence someone to go out, and try one of these amazing Blind Horse Knives products with a similar contest!"" So here it is folks. One of you lucky knife lovers will get a brand new, never opened, BHK [Woodsman](http://www.blindhorseknives.com/woodsmanpro.htm) Pro. Totally free. All you have to do is send me an email to Moose3040@gmail.com, as to why you think you deserve/want this knife!~~

~~I'll be checking the entries as the arrive, and will decide a winner in a week, to give everyone time to get a submission in.~~

~~As a quick note, I just ordered the knife today. As these knives are handmade, the turn around for me to get the knife can be up to 30 days! If you can't wait that long for a handmade in America, top notch quality, razor sharp and beautiful knife....then this contest isn't for you.~~

~~To those that don't win; DON'T GET DISCOURAGED! Check these knives out, and find a way to get your hands on one!~~

~~***EDIT*** Please include your reddit username in your email, thank you!~~


~~***SECOND EDIT*** Guys, I know it may be tempting to downvote this contest and thus ""increase your chances of winning."" But the idea of this contest is much bigger than just winning. It's introducing people to some great knives, at reasonable prices. I'm not saying toss upvotes on it, but I am saying, don't downwvote it.~~


~~***EDIT NUMBER THREE*** Some people have mentioned wanting to keep this a going thing. Like, the winner (or anyone for that matter) follows in the foot steps of the OP (in this case myself, and chefmatthew) and host a contest themselves. I think it's a great idea, and would add a real sense of togetherness to Knifeit, which it so desperately needs. What are your thoughts? Should keep this kind of thing alive and going?~~


~~***ANOTHER EDIT*** I'm doing my best to reply to everyone via email! If I don't reply to your post here on reddit, I'm sorry ): I had no idea I'd end up with this many emails to attend to!~~


~~***ONE MORE EDIT*** So guys, I sent an email to BHK and let them know about the contest and they didn't just reply to me, but they made a reddit account of their own, and they're getting involved here with us right now! Look down in the comments and find them so you can take advantage of their knife knowledge and ask any questions you might have! Seriously an awesome company. In a side note, my replying will be slow tonight, I'm away from home and my laptop broke, so I can only do this on my phone. Hope this doesn't inconvenience anyone ):~~

~~***LATEST EDIT*** Well folks, back home and on the desktop. I'm working on my laptop now (thanks to those who messaged me with hopes of helping to fix it). My replies should get back to normal, I'm really sorry if any of you sent me an email and haven't received a reply. ***IT DOESN'T MEAN I DIDN'T GET YOUR SUBMISSION!***
Anyways, in a last note kind of thing, it seems the heat of this competition is dying down, so I may announce the winner a little sooner than expected. Keep an eye out here, and check this post at least twice a day (morning and night) for updates. Thanks again everyone!~~"	t5_2qzyn	True

How do I convince them of my good intentions and reason with them on why I should own several knives.

I sent in my Freestyle because a screw had fallen out expecting them to just replace the screw and send it back. Not only did they replace the screw, they also sharpened the blade amazingly and added a pocket clip, which was the only thing I didn't like about the Freestyle. It's great to see big companies taking care of their customers so well, which seems to be a reoccurring theme in the knife industry.	t5_2qzyn	True
